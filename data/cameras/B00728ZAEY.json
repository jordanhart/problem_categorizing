Canon SX230 HS(Please note: embedded images are not possible, so I've uploaded a few of the referenced images here on Amazon separately, along with several other representative images.)From left, the Panasonic ZS-15, Canon SX230, Sony HX5V, and a Panasonic ZR-3. There isn't a huge difference in envelope dimensions. Only the older ZR-3 is significantly slimmer.From the back, the thin profile of the ZR-3 is easily discernible. Between the two primary subject cameras discussed here, the new ZS-15 and the SX230, there isn't enough difference to worry about.Recently, I reviewed a battery of compact point and shoot genre digital cameras suitable for hunting and the outdoors. The losers were the Nikon S9100 for poor build quality, very poor video, and sounding like a tractor when you operate the zoom. Not a healthy tractor at that. The Sony HX7V exhibited truly sea-slug slow shooting performance. The middle of the road was taken up by a previous Sony model, the Sony HX5V, while connecting to a PC with a truly wacky proprietary Sony adapter, often took very good pictures, is well-built, but is still noticeably slow compared to several Canon and Panasonic models. The winners were the Canon SX230 overall (easily) with an honorable mention to the older Panasonic DMC-ZR3 for its slimness, responsiveness, very low price, and excellent battery life . . . noting that the more current, but similarly performing Panasonic DMC-FH25K model was quite a bargain at its $140 street price or even a tad less.The Canon Powershot SX230, with its 14x optical zoom range, has produced some very good images for me. There are situations where the 14x zoom just isn't enough, like the above image of turkeys shot from the far side of a clover field. For extended zoom range without additional bulk or great cost, the new Panasonic ZS-15 has the potential to fill the bill.In this genre of camera, it only makes sense to compare it to similarly configured cameras with similar envelope dimensions at similar price points. It makes very little sense to try to compare it to a camera with only 3, 4, 5, or 6x zoom. Nor does it make any sense to compare it with a bulky camera that isn't fitting into a pocket.Most of the 2012 \"travel zoom\" models are out and as usual, there is a mix of hits and disappointments in what is called the travel zoom category, generally compact point and shoot cameras with 10x or better zoom ranges, often including a GPS. Already, a few of the newer models can be safely deemed a step backward. Inexplicably, the Nikon 9300 adds a GPS to last year's 9100 and along with that dubious feature adds an even more dubious 16 megapixel sensor. Currently, it is way overpriced at its $345 street price and wouldn't be competitive even if it was a hundred dollars or so less as far as I'm concerned. As a sad bonus, the image quality from the Nikon 9300 has taken a nosedive, even at base ISO.Last year's Sony DSC-HX9V has been replaced by the DSC-HX10V, cramming 18 megapixels onto its tiny sensor resulting in a loss in image quality along the way. Still selling near its retail price of $329.99, it doesn't compare favorably to Canon and Panasonic product. The new Canon SX260 stretches the optical zoom of the SX230 from 14x out to 20x, it runs $300 as of this writing, and it also adds a plethora of new scene modes. It is easy to generally recommend the SX260 as it yields essentially the same performance as the SX230 with the same sensor. It is an incremental improvement, though, and if the 14x zoom of the SX230 is enough for you the remaining SX230's are a bargain at about $199 street price. 100% crops give a slight image quality benefit to the SX230 as well: something subtle enough to go unnoticed in a full image.You might be wondering when I'm going to get to the Panasonic ZS15, so am I, but I'll get there. Though Panasonic has generally been credited with pioneering this branch of digital camera, their 2011 offerings fell flat. The DMC-ZS10 was described as 'doing everything right except take good pictures' by one reviewer, Jeff Keller, which about sums it up. The 2012 flagship Panasonic super-zoom, the DMC-ZS20, gets Panasonic back in the game with a 20x zoom, a comparatively full-featured GPS, currently offered at the equally full-featured price of $325 or so. While I debated, I decided it wasn't worth reviewing the ZS-20 compared to this Lumix ZS15, a comparative screaming deal at $230 street, or less.What you give up in saving a hundred dollars is what I find of little value: the GPS, the longer zoom (16x is generous enough), and stereo video recording. If anything, the ZS15 nets you slightly better image quality, better battery life (no GPS or touch screen) and you lose little else. There is no particular reason to avoid the 20x ZS20, I've tested one example, but the more fiscally conservative folks will say that the so-called \"downgraded\" ZS15 is no downgrade at all for hunting and outdoor use-- and general use for that matter.The ZS15 uses the new sensor from the Panasonic FZ-150 (a very, *very* good thing) coupled with the lens and body from the ZS-10 (not a bad thing). The sensor obviously boosts image quality, the precise area where the ZS-10 stumbled so badly.It has been often said that Panasonic has the best artificial intelligence algorithms in the point and shoot camera segment. Their iA (intelligent auto) mode is industry leading, in my opinion. It is as close to \"set it and forget it\" as can be found. The Lumix ZS15 uses a higher resolution LCD screen (460,000 pixels) compared to its earlier and cheaper models, keeping pace with the Canon in pixels, and foregoes the sometimes annoying pop-up flash in favor of an integral camera body flash, an approach I prefer for general outdoor work particularly.Sony has long had the \"sweep panorama\" mode, still ignored by Canon, but finally added here by Panasonic. The battery life of 260 pictures (CIPA Standard) is not shockingly good, but is above average and no GPS or touch screen drain is present. Markedly better than the Nikon 9300 (200 shots) a bit better than the Canon SX230 / SX260 (230 shots), but not close to the Sony HSX-10V (340 shots). Note, however, that the Canon / Nikon / Sony numbers are all estimated with their GPS units turned off. One other useful mode, the High Dynamic Range mode, is added and it is surprisingly effective in difficult lighting conditions.According to Panasonic, \"the Intelligent Zoom is an extensive zoom function using digital zoom, however, you can even draw the subject 2x closer than the original optical zoom with minimum deterioration of image quality thanks to the Intelligent Resolution technology. This means the 16x optical can virtually extend to 32x equivalent.\" 16x zoom is a goodly amount of zoom as is, a notch better than the 14x Canon SX230. I'm very hesitant to call it as good as true optical zoom, it isn't, but it appears surprising close and in the rare instances where you really need 32x for a still, you've got the shot. It does extend the versatility of the camera.At 4.13 x 2.27 x 1.31 inch, the envelope dimensions of this camera are slightly more compact than many and the .46 lb. weight with battery and memory card is also appealing. On the negative side, ostensibly to save money, Panasonic has gone to in-camera battery charging which not only puts the camera out of commission but is unbearably slow compared to wall chargers. Consider the addition of an optional wall charger an absolute must, along with an extra battery. Those planning extensive video capture should consider an extra battery or two mandatory. As the temperature outside drops, so does battery life along with it.I am hesitant to put prices into a digital camera review, as they can change drastically overnight. By the time the holiday shopping season rolls around, you'll likely see some impressive deals based not on camera quality or performance, but just what is left in inventory that needs to be moved to make way for the next year's wonderments. It can be worth waiting for, if you are on a budget. The bad news is that the most popular models may well get sold out and don't make it over to the price cutting stage. If the 20x zoom and GPS holds great appeal for you, you may well want the ZS-20 for the extra c-note. Same situation with Canon, the extra zoom, extra scene modes, and handling features might be worth the hundred dollar upcharge for the SX260 vs. the SX230. It isn't for me, but that is why they call them choices. So, I'll compare last year's winner, the Canon SX230, directly to this Panasonic ZS-15 which should help make the differences a bit more clear.Battery life: Panasonic wins.Battery charging: Canon wins, as supplied, with an included speedy external charger.Zoom Range: Panasonic wins on both ends.Size / Weight: Advantage to slightly shorter Panasonic, but by the very smallest of margins. No practical advantage either way.LCD screen: The Canon's 16:9 screen is better for video than 4:3 stills, the reverse is true in the case of the Panasonic. The Canon screen has substantially better viewing angles; apparently the ZS-15 screen is of the \"twisted nematic\" variety.Video features: Canon has high speed video modes for lower-resolution slow-motion video. Canon also has stereo sound, but the stereo separation on pocket mega-zooms is not distinct. Panasonic lacks these features, but does have better 30 fps HD video vs. the 24 fps HD of the Canon.Sensor: Sensor size is the same, the dinky 1/2.3 inch common to many compacts. Both are about 12MP effective resolution, both are of the latest BSI / CMOS type. The \"backside illuminated\" genre of sensors is no gimmick; while still tiny they are a noticeable jump ahead of CCD sensors. Note that the $600 FZ-200 uses the same mini-sized 1/2.33 sensor as the ZS-15.To test the intelligent zoom, I shot representative pictures of my utility box on a windy, rainy day from a laser-verified 43 yards. The pictures were taken at the 5M mode (2560 x 1920) and resized with no cropping to 640 x 480 for web use. First, the Panasonic ZS-15 that yields an indicated, astounding, 37.9x zoom.The same was done with closest Canon mode (2816 x 2112) also resized with no cropping to 640 x 480.Both shots were made hand-held in the wind. The more I experimented with the ZS-15 the more it became apparent that the intelligent zoom is no gimmick, but an immensely useable feature. For close images with perfect lighting conditions, many compact digital cameras do a perfectly fine job for snapshots. For typical portraits and family events, speed isn't always important, and you can often get as close as you need to be. Slow focus, slow shot to shot times and overall sluggish performance has been the stopper for several otherwise enjoyable cameras, particularly several Sony models. Last year's Canon SX230 was a substantial improvement. This year's ZS-15 from Panasonic addresses the weak link of previous Panasonic compact long-zooms, that being poor image quality. In doing so, it has not just closed the gap with Canon and Sony travel zoom cameras, it has leaped ahead by a good margin.Again handheld at 37.9x \"intelligent zoom,\" this unsuspecting robin was snapped from across my front lawn with the ZS-15. The image, despite being handheld, is surprising sharp considering the aggressive \"intelligent\" zoom. Without any cropping or retouching, it was resized to 800 x 600 for this web page.One of the promised technologies incorporated in the Lumix ZS-15 is the \"shoots through glass\" mode. Here, shot through my front window, a squirrel comes out to enjoy an after rain-shower snack.As you might be guessing by now, the just-released Panasonic Lumix ZS-15 exceeded the shooting performance of the already excellent SX230 handily, with far greater capabilities and noticeably faster operation. There isn't much to find fault with, but I'll try. The turtle-slow USB charging is a step backward and \"genuine\" Panasonic branded batteries are overpriced. You can solve both issues by picking up a Wasabi Power charger and twin pack of batteries that are rated at 1200 milliamps, compared to the OEM 895mAh for 27 dollars, which is exactly what I did. The supplied Panasonic software is both \"wizard-crazy\" and forgettable. The full manual is on CD, and like most I'd prefer a bound copy. These issues are only niggles at best. Yes, the Panasonic 460K could be better in the viewing angle department, there are much better 921K LCDs out there as on this $335 Sony Sony Cyber-shot DSC-HX20V 18.2 MP Exmor R CMOS Digital Camera with 20x Optical Zoom and 3.0-inch LCD (Black) (2012 Model)though Panasonic at least partially combats this with \"Power LCD\" (bright) and \"High Angle\" modes.The ZS-15 captures essentially noise free images not just at base ISO, but also at ISO 200 and ISO 400. It produces far better images at ISO 400 than some older, larger sensor cameras, like the Nikon Coolpix P7000. Concert enthusiasts will consider the ZS-15 a dream come true, as it isn't much more than set the ISO to 400 or 800 in Program mode, and you're there. ISO 800 images print as dazzling 8 x 10s, although at the 100% crop level ISO 400 captures are cleaner. To give you an idea, at ISO 800 a picture of my computer monitor, in a dimly lit room, at 3x zoom hits 1/160 second shutter speed: more than sufficient for most any concert use. In very dark conditions, the \"Handheld Night Scene\" mode blazes away, cracking off four images then forming a composite that is pleasing at ISO 1250, though like any composite it often isn't the best for moving subjects.For a fast-operating, long zoom camera that is easy to slip into a pocket and has the ability to take shots you never thought you'd get, effortlessly, with a wondrous artificial intelligence mode, the ZS-15 can only be described as a screaming deal at $230 or less. By comparison, most other travel cams feel underpowered, non-responsive, and sluggish as in the \"processing\" screen of doom when you would really like to take another shot. It is truly rare to have a pocketable long-zoom digital camera that just gets it all right, but this new Lumix ZS-15 is as close as I've ever experienced.As a footnote, I took care of the extra battery and external charger needs with this: Wasabi Power Battery (2-Pack) and Charger for Panasonic DMW-BCG10, DMW-BCG10E, DMW-BCG10PP and Lumix DMC-3D1, DMC-TZ6, DMC-TZ7, DMC-TZ8, DMC-TZ10, DMC-TZ18, DMC-TZ19, DMC-TZ20, DMC-TZ25, DMC-TZ30, DMC-ZR1, DMC-ZR3, DMC-ZS1, DMC-ZS3, DMC-ZS5, DMC-ZS6, DM...Memory cards get faster and cheaper with regularity. At the current pricing, it is hard not to use 16GB cards (ideal if you pan on capturing some video) but 8GB cards are fine for most if still images are mostly what you are after.I'm personally amazed that you can get a camera this darn good for $150 (12/2012 pricing). I was quite satisfied with my first unit @ $230, no one could possibly disappointed at the current $150 threshold. As far as \"better\" cameras, sure . . . there will always be better if you can tolerate larger and more expensive units. If larger, a bit heavier, and more expensive (but still compact / fixed lens) is no barrier, the Panasonic LUMIX DMC-LX7K 10.1 MP Digital Camera with 7.5x Intelligent zoom and 3.0-inch LCD -  Black is worthy of your consideration.

This is my fourth Lumix, preceded by the TZ3, TZ5 and ZS5. The ZS15 is by far the best of the series. Although the hardware of the ZS15 sports several improvements, I find the greatest improvements are with the software.Let me describe six of the features which I really like:a. Custom Function Switch: This allows for 4 user selected settings. I set the C1 to a burst of 3 images at different exposures for HDR processing. These 3 images shoot rapidly, at a much improved rate. (I find the in-camera HDR almost useless). I set C2-1 to the night image mode which allows for in-camera processing of four images to reduce the noise of the high gain on the sensor. You will be amazed at the images you can take with this feature.  I set C2-2 to the horizontal panorama from left to right. I set the C2-3 to the vertical panorama from bottom to top. As with the night images, you will quickly fall in love with these features.b. The Time-Lapse Video:  By shooting video in the miniature mode of the Creative Control menu, you can record time lapse images at 2 second intervals.  The camera saves the time-lapse video in .MTS format. A convenient red button turns the video recording on and off.I did not buy the more expensive ZS20 because I do not need the 20x zoom, the GPS, the 16MP sensor or the touch screen.  I'm indifferent to some of the other new features. The 12MP images have more pixels but I find that the processing requires more sharpening. The smaller size of the ZS20 would have been convenient but I've gotten used to the original size. The charging via the USB port means I will not need to carry the charger with me when I travel, but I did like the possibility of having a spare battery in the charger. You cannot operate the ZS15 while it is charging. The camera has a built-in demo program and Panasonic includes a comprehensive digital manual on a CD. A new feature has the description of most menu selections scrolling across the bottom of the screen.In summary: I am very happy with my ZS15 and would recommend it to nearly everyone, professional, semi-pro or amateur. There are many good reviews if you want to make a side by side comparison of features with other cameras or with the ZS20.", "Date": "June 3, 2012"}, {"Title": "An absolute winner and quality product!", "Author": "Spicerpro", "ReviewID": "RKHDXVYMRTABS", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I loved this camera right out of the box! I own mid-size digital SLR's and previous Panasonic pocket cameras. For my purposes, the Lumix DMC-ZS15 is the best of both worlds.This P&S; sports a distortion-free 24mm wide angle with an amazingly sharp 383mm zoom. The auto-focus is very responsive and works as one would hope. Image stabilization is accomplished through the lens and works well when shooting video, especially at long focal lengths. The Intelligent Auto Mode is a wonderful feature when you just want to shoot and move on. And yet, the manual controls offer excellent control when you need it. Low-light shooting is terrific.Like with any new camera, you get use to the menu layout as you gain experience using it. Of course, reading the manual front-to-back serves as a necessary overview, plus there are neat features you would not otherwise know exist.The video performance is excellent. As a professional filmmaker, I particularly appreciate the true 29.97 frame rate. Previous Panasonic models were 30 fps, which played havoc with DVD's and BRD's. The dynamic range of the MOS sensor is much better than previous CCD's I have owned. Also, the audio is clean and quiet at 48,000 kHz.I could go on and on about my sheer delight with this camera. My only suggestion is that they include an external battery charger rather than requiring users to charge in the camera. For that reason, I bought a Panasonic DE-A65BA Battery Charger and Panasonic DMW-BCG10PP ID Secured Battery. Charging time is much faster and the extra battery is a must if you plan on doing a lot of shooting.The Lumix DMC-ZS15 is highly recommended!", "Date": "May 4, 2012"}, {"Title": "Upgraded from the FH-5, very pleased!", "Author": "Nicodimus", "ReviewID": "R3HX36IL8OUOGQ", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Disclaimer: I am a complete novice and am approaching the review from the perspective of someone who will be using the camera for very basic things, with the Intelligent Auto mode on the vast majority of the time. Last year, I purchased the Panasonic Lumix FH-5. I wanted a very compact camera that could take good, quick pictures while I was out hiking. In general, while I was pleased with the FH-5, two glaring weaknesses became apparent: poor battery life and an underpowered 4X optical zoom. For an upgrade, I wanted to stick with a Panasonic Lumix, so I examined both the ZS-20 and the ZS-15. Ultimately, I went with the ZS-15 for a few reasons: I hate touch screens, I had no use for the GPS feature of the ZS-20, it was using a great sensor (the same one found in the FZ-150) and it was $80 cheaper.I am happy to report that I got pretty much exactly what I wanted with the ZS-15. It has a 24mm-equivalent lens, allowing you to get great widescreen pics for a point-and-shoot. While it is noticeably bulkier than the FH-5, it's still JUST small enough to slip into my pocket as I go hiking. The battery life is *much* improved over the FH-5...I swear it seems to last twice as long. I also like the fact that you can just plug the camera in to recharge it now, rather than removing the battery and messing with an external battery charger. The most impressive thing about this camera to me is the zoom. The 16X optical zoom really knocked my socks off, coming from the 4X of the FH-5. Even better, the iZoom feature allows you to get up to 32X zoom (according to the camera, anyway...I see another review here that mentions it is actually more.) This does not seem to be just another useless digital zoom gimmick, but a really useful feature. Now that I don't have to get very close to wildlife to get a picture, the animals don't get scared away as quickly and I wind up with much better photos of them. I took and labelled sample pictures of a distant house at no zoom, 4X, 8X, 16X, and 32X to show you the difference, so please review them up top. They were all taken handheld, with the camera in intelligent auto mode.Although it initially sounds like a downgrade in image quality (16MP for the FH-5 vs 12MP for the ZS-15) I cannot see any dropoff, even looking at the pictures on a 61\" HDTV. I guess the better sensor makes up for the lower MP photos. In fact, the ZS-15 allows you to get 40% closer on macro shots than the FH-5, and they look fantastic. I still take my photos in the 16:9 aspect ratio, and with the quality setting on 'fine' I can get 1834 photos on my 8gb card, compared to 1485 on the FH-5. Since I can't see any difference, it seems like I just got another 349 photos worth of capacity. There are not a ton of bells and whistles on the ZS-15, and the interface is simple, but that's exactly what I wanted. I played with the video recording a little bit, and although I will rarely use it, it seems quite nice. You can zoom in and out while recording, but it does so slowly (I think this is intentional, so that the lens motor noise isn't as noticeable in the sound of your video.) The only really obvious weakness of this camera that I see is that it struggles in low-light situations and produces noisy, yellowish images in darkened areas. (This may correctable by manually adjusting things, but I'm only using IA mode since I don't know what I'm doing.) The FH-5 was even worse in this regard, and I knew about this issue before buying and just accepted it. Overall, I am delighted with the ZS-15 and it does what I need it to do very well.Update: If you are looking for a semi-hard case to protect your camera while it's not in use, I found a good one. It's a universal case by Kodak that fits this camera perfectly. The UPC is 041771753283 (Google it to preview.) It's just plain black without any logos, and has a zipper. I found mine in wal*mart next to the digital cameras, but places like best buy also sell it. It runs about $15.", "Date": "May 3, 2012"}, {"Title": "A fabulous automatic point & shoot that rivals more expensive \"bridge\" cameras.", "Author": "OldPhotoGuy", "ReviewID": "R2LJFPUMTS309Z", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "After years of being a Canon guy, Panasonic won me over last year with their Lumix FZ35 \"bridge\" camera, a top of the line, compact zoom that looks like a DSLR but has no interchangeable lenses and lets you shoot totally automatic or go manual. Without making this a FZ review, those cameras take fabulous still and  HD videos automatically that will please the most fussy photographer. That Lumix line is still going strong with plenty of budget point choices for the serious amateur. I should note that I entered the digital world six or seven years ago with my prized all-metal body Canon SD450 Powershot Elph, a 5 mp little wonder that is a tiny terror that continues to take great stills and videos. So why am I buying another with two pleasers in my collection? Like a DSLR, my FZ35 is a bit too bulky to tote around daily for spontaneous shots, it's best reserved for the birthday, holiday, special event shots I take at home. So being a camera junkie, I thought it was time to treat myself to one of the hundreds, perhaps thousands, of new, updated pocket-size cams that have come out since I purchased my Canon SD450 about 7 years ago. Specifcally, I was looking for a bigger LCD, longer optical zoom, better low-light sensitivity, preferably with one of the new CMOS sensors vs CCD, more megapixels to handle enlargements, and HD video (at least 720p which computers like) with zoom and continuous autofocus capability. These features are easy to find today, and frankly are on almost every point and shoot camera you might be considering over $100.  The one thing I will likely lose from the old Canon SD450 is the viewfinder, as most manufacturers have discontinued giving you one on the point and shoots. But that's OK, my other cams have them if I encounter a serious outdoor bright light problem, or I could throw on one of those nifty folding combo light hoods and screen protectors for about $10.So how did I find the Panasonic SZ15 out of the way-too-many choices? At first, the challenge seems daunting. Every manufacturer makes so many variations of the same camera, that it's a project in itself to figure which feature was dropped or added between model A and B. Therefore, I take a 3 step process to narrow down my choices. First of all, I go to the Amazon Best Sellers list for the category to see what is ranked #1, you can't argue with the marketplace, it's generally pretty accurate. The number one seller was the Panasonic ZS20, the model above the one I bought. The ZS15 is one step below and anywhere from $30 to $65 cheaper depending on the price you catch it at. I got mine for $165, currently it's $199. But the ZS15 was ranked #38 on that list, so why did I buy it? I probably wouldn't have if I had only used that best seller list. However, my next step was to Google up some professional reviews on the ZS20. A good reviewer will usually mention nearby models and steer you in the right direction. In this case, the reviewer loved the ZS20 and stated if you didn't need the GPS function, which tells you forever exactly where that pics was taken on the map, buy the ZS15 because it will save you money and essentially you have the same camera as the number one seller. I wasn't interested in GPS, so I followed his advice, and he was absolutely right! As a final check before I ordered it, I looked up the consumer reviews. Both the ZS20 and ZS15 had 4.5 stars and glowing reviews, so I purchased it. Had I only used the best seller list, I would have never considered the ZS15 as it was way too far down on the list. But I believe this kind of thing constantly happens when camera manufacturers make so many similar models, many get lost in the shuffle, or buyers simply buy the \"loaded\" one to make sure they have everything they need as they learn to use the camera. Forgive me for spending so much time on the choosing process, but I hope this may help others from overlooking better,wiser, less expensive choices by doing just a little more research prior to purchase.Now for the camera itself. I've owned it about 5 days now and so far I am very pleased. It's a little thicker than many pocket cameras, but I love the metal body and controls, it speaks quality out of the box. Mine was made in Japan and they still build good cameras there. The controls set-up and software is similar to that of my upscale Panasonic FZ35 so the learning curve to use and understand all was short for me. I figured the best test was to shoot the same pics and videos using the FZ35 (which is about twice the price of the ZS15) then download the results on my computer and do side-by-side comparisons. And that's exactly what I did. All shots were done set on IA or P or Macro, both with and without flash on.  I have to say the ZS15 shots were amazingly close to ZS35 shots, whether I was doing stills or videos. In fact, most people probably couldn't tell the difference and would be totally delighted. If the FZ35 is a 10, I'd rate the ZS15 a 9. The autofocus system worked perfectly both on close-up and on video, as well. The ZS's sound is mono vs stereo on the FZ's, but it too is not detectable on the computer view. I shot in 720p mode on both which is MPEG-4 on ZS15 whereas the FZ35 is MOV.com. Both formats looked great on my computer screen, though you may have to download a viewer like KMP or VLC instead of using your built-in Windows movie viewer. The ZS has a neat auto-retouch and creative retouch feature. With the push of a button it will show you an alternative look, and if you like it you can save it without losing the orgininal shot. Both have dedicated movie buttons to start and stop, and yes, you can zoom during video shoots.  The Leica lenses do their cameras proud in both cases. The macro shots with the ZS15 were quite amazing, fabulous detail, even when it settled on that mode itself using the IA setting, which I believe stands for Intelligent Automatic mode. One quick negative side note, instead of the traditional battery charger, the ZS15 comes with a cord that charges the battery in the camera using either AC or your computer's USB port. This is a bit inconvenient, especially for charging back-up batteries for special events, so I'm going to buy a charger for it on Amazon along with a back-up battery and that problem will be solved for very little money.That's all I have to say for now, so if you're looking for very well built, mostly metal, pocket-sized point and shoot camera that will automatically give you pictures that will rival some of the best bridge and entry level DSLR's, I'd recommend this one.

I don't think anyone would accept it's output; I sure hope it was defective.So, I took a risk and ordered the ZS15 - no-one had even seen it at the time; it was an \"unknown\" - all I knew was that it had Panasonic's incredible Power OIS, which beats the cr@p out of any other IS system; and it had the same sensor as the FZ150 - which again, beat the cr@p out of any other current 12 mp sensor.Well,... I am not disappointed. The pics are sharp, well exposed, and overall, infinitely better than the shite I was getting from the Nikon. Noise reduction is there, don't think you'll avoid it, but it's not an issue at normal print sizes; OIS is a marvel and even 1/4 second photos are sharp. Videos are quite good; no problems with the \"jello\", and the OIS works well.

It had great features, was small and looked nice. But the photos and video were just so disappointing, an unwelcome surprise after having enjoyed other Nikons over the years. After two weeks of studying the manual and trying different settings, it was returned.I've had a Lumix DMC-TZ4 before and remember the Leica lens was pretty impressive. Well, combine that with a fast sensor and some incredible features and the ZS-15 has me enthralled. The iA setting works for the overwhelming majority of shots. The HDR feature does a better job with high contrast situations than some pretty expensive competitors. The lens is impressive and not only is the 16X optical great, but the optical image stabilizer and Intelligent Zoom make this the first digital camera where I've ever used the digital zoom, at least more than once!The object tracking feature does a remarkable job of getting moving objects like pets, kid and cars in focus. (This was the biggest downfall of the S6300. Anything that moved became blurry even in bright sunlight.)Video quality is also amazing. Here again, the image stabilizer makes most hand-held shots look like they were shot on a tripod. Although AVCHD looks great on my TV, it's too difficult to deal with on the computer, so I'm going to stick with the MP4 setting. It's great to have a choice, though.For viewing photos or video on a flat screen TV, I ordered a 10' HDMI-Mini HDMI cable. This was less than $5 on Amazon and works great with the ZS-15: Premium Canon Mini HDMI cable (10 ft)Also, I get no hissing or buzzing in the video whether or not I'm using zoom. The microphone picks up sounds quite nicely and yet doesn't completely boom when I do something like try to narrate. And, unlike other cameras I've used, doesn't seem to make those rumbling noises when you change your grip on the camera.Technology has certainly improved in the few years since I bought my last digital camera. But after that first discouraging purchase, Panasonic has me enthralled again. It's got more features than I can remember how to use. The most important thing though is, it takes a nice, sharp photograph or some pretty fine HD video.

I read many positive reviews on dpreview regarding a device called  the \"Clearviewer\". It screws on to the tripod mount, and unfolds to the back of the camera actually giving all the benefits of an Electronic Viewfinder, and it lets you see the LCD display in the sun.I'd suggest anyone reading this to google clearviewer, and check out the product.

Since the ZS15 was significantly less expensive than the ZS20, I decided it was worth trying both. As far as I can tell, the technical differences between the two are A) 20x optical zoom vs 15x optical zoom, B) 14.1 MP vs 12.1 MP, and C) the ZS20 has GPS but the ZS15 does not.As most casual, yet technically savvy, photographers already know, the 2 MP is not going to make a huge difference at this level for day-to-day picture taking. As for me, this camera is to take pictures of family (usually kids) and of nature/wildlife. We live in Colorado and spend a lot of time in the mountains taking pictures of the scenery and wildlife, so a good optical zoom was very important for me. I've never blown up a non-professional picture bigger than 11x14, so the megapixel difference was a wash for me. Another big requirement I have is decent picture taking in low light. It's not like I'm trying to take pictures inside, at night, with the lights off - but it would be nice to take pictures in a room with dim lighting without the flash making everything look funky or getting picture after picture with people's eyes closed.Out of the box, I started taking pictures with both the iA mode and various different \"scene\" modes. Honestly, on both cameras, I found most scenarios to have the same experience and quality. However, with taking pictures in EXTREMELY low light (with a light on behind me but no lighting in the room of the subject I was taking a picture of) were quite different between the two cameras. It seems that the less light in the room, the longer it would be for the camera to take the picture after pressing down on the button. There was a much longer delay on the ZS20 in this circumstance, and it was extremely frustrating. At first, I even thought I wasn't pressing the button down, but I was. The ZS15 still had a delay, but not quite as long as the ZS20. I tried this in both iA and multiple scene modes and had the same result. Again, this was extreme, as I was doing it in a room with almost no light - I could not even see what I was looking at through the LCD screen because it was so dark. I'm sure this can be corrected with manual settings, but I am not going to kid myself into thinking I'm going to learn the finer technical points of photography overnight. I couldn't tell any difference between the two cameras when it came to nighttime scenery with light (a dark street with streetlights) or natural daylight pictures.Sometimes I was very disappointed with the picture quality, but it was not the camera's fault. I know this because if I changed the settings, the same exact picture would look EXTREMELY different. If I didn't know any better, I would have thought the pictures were taken with two separate cameras. The reason I mention this is that I think this camera has fantastic potential. If you are willing to take the time to learn about cameras and the different settings to use in particular conditions, this will be an amazing camera. This is something I want to do, but I also wanted something that will take very good pictures out of the box using the default modes that are built in. If you are unable or unwilling to fiddle with changing to different presets and figuring out when to use those at the very least, I do not think this camera will be good for you. I am very excited to learn how to do the manual settings as I think this will take this camera to an even higher level. Again, the potential seems very high.As far as the zoom goes, the 16x vs 20x was something I was very curious about. Can I zoom in more on the 20x? Well, duh, of course I can! Enough to justify the cost difference? Eh, not so much. Optical zoom is very important to me, but 16x was more than enough to fulfill my needs. I just didn't think the extra zoom was worth it for me. The intelligent zoom is very good on both cameras to go beyond the optical zoom, which surprised me. I was able to take hand-held pictures at full zoom on both cameras without blur. Even taking pictures of a full moon on full zoom were quite impressive.The touch screen I didn't find particularly good. It's one of those that you kinda need to depress a little, which to me is not a sign of a very good or responsive touch screen. However, a touch screen on this camera that is similarly responsive as a high-end smartphone I think would cause a lot of accidental touches. So in this case, the touch screen is neither a plus nor a minus. I could go without it but it does not detract from it either.THE BOTTOM LINE:* Decent camera out of the box. It is definitely not a good choice for the older crowd or people who are not very technically inclined. If you can't program your DVR or set up a home wireless network (which to me are incredibly easy and basic things), then this is not for you. Stick with a Kodak EasyShare or a Canon PowerShot, which are more user-friendly from my experience.* Lots of potential with manual settings if you are willing to learn more than the average camera user to get the most out of your camera.* Optical zoom is fantastic for the camera size and price point.* Manual settings give this camera a significant advantage over similar cameras in this price range.Should you get the ZS20 or ZS15?I ultimately decided to keep the ZS15. I do not care about the GPS on the ZS20. For optical zoom, 16x already met my needs and I do not think the 4x extra zoom was worth the money. The 2 MP difference between the two cameras shouldn't matter for anyone that is specifically looking for this class of camera (an affordable, compact, point-and-shoot). If you really want the GPS or 4x more zoom, by all means get the more expensive camera - it just wasn't worth it for me. With the money I saved by sticking with the ZS15, I can get a new video game and a 12 pack of my favorite microbrew :)", "Date": "November 30, 2012"}, {"Title": "Is it better than a Canon?", "Author": "C. Self", "ReviewID": "R2UOXA1WTYTAQW", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "My intention of this review is to help previous Canon users looking to branch out:While I come from a family of photographers and camera lovers, I am in every way an amateur.  I typically have a camera in my hand (especially with an almost 2 year old daughter), but I always stick with the point and shoot variety; I just want to quickly capture a memory, and I want the camera to do the work for me.  My entire life I have loved and purchased Canon.  In fact when my latest camera broke (the powershot A3000 IS), I planned on buying the Canon elph 110 hs.  Just before I ordered though, I happened across a good deal on the Panasonic Lumix dmc zs8 which led me to start investigating the brand further. But I was desperate to make a decision quickly as my daughters 2nd birthday is days away.I compared the Canon elph 300 hs, canon elph 110 hs, panasonic lumix dmc zs8, zs15, & zs20.  Beware though, the prices on these seem to change frequently.  Already Amazon has this one $25 cheaper than what I just paid.After deciding which canon I wanted, I compared the panasonics amongst themselves:zs8 vs zs15The zs8 seemed liked it was a little outdated, but has great reviews!  I was able to play around with it in Best Buy, and really liked the dedicated fast zoom button (meaning it jumps to extreme zoom in a split second), but that was replaced by a dedicated video record button on the zs15 (so the zs15 lost this feature entirely.)  Both cameras feel exactly the same, and minus the zoom/record button, they have the same functional layout. The zs15 includes new options like 3D photos (which I doubt I'll ever use.) The zs8 has more mega pixels at 14.1 versus the 12.1 of the zs15.  But please remember I am a TOTAL ameteur who just happens to love photography, so this wasn't a big deal for me.  Most of these terms are beyond me, and while I try to research how each makes one camera better than another, I still get confused.  So in the end, I'm simple; I compare reviews on amazon and good old google search, user posted pictures, cost, and overall funtionality.  I decided the quick zoom wasn't important, and at a currently cheaper price and equally good reviews, I decided for the zs15.zs15 vs zs20Again these 2 cameras seemed similar whereas the zs20 was about $20 more expensive.  It includes feature like GPS which will link your pictures to the location they were taken, stereo sound recording versus the mono of the zs15, greater zoom at 20x versus the zs15 16x, 14.1 mega pixel, touch screen functionality and lots more...but all of that is beyond my real need and usage, so again I decided for the cheaper side of things.  I also worried that the more gagets like touch screen, the more things that could malfuntion eventually.  But for those who are more in the know and would actually use those features, $20 could be a real deal and the zs20 might be a better purchase.Now why I chose the lumix dmc zs15 instead of the elph 110 hs?1. I wanted to give something else a chance bc I wasn't in love with my last canon2. I loved the bulkier feel of cameras a few years ago that made it easy to take pictures one handed.  The panasonic while still easily a pocket camera, has a fantastic grip hold that current point and shoot canon's just don't have.  No it is not as small as the elph, but this was not a negative for me.3. I've read mixed reviews of the canon's flash placement.  Panasonic seems to have fixed this entirely by putting the flash on the other side.4. Canon has taken their mode choices off the top of the camera and put it into the menu.  This seems tedious.  Panasonic has left their's on top.5. I take a lot of motion/action shots of kids/pets.  I knew for sure the Panasonic would keep these shots blur free.6. the zoom - 110 hs's 5x vs zs15's 16x...there was no question7. Canon's have been getting slower in their point and shoot digital cameras.  Missing the next shot because you're waiting for the first to load became increasingly annoying.  I was pleasently surprised to discover the zs15 shoots quickly with VERY little lag between shots.8. the zs15 on/off switch vs the 110 hs on/off button.  A simple thing, but the switch actually seems better aka faster and easier.9. panasonics have some internal memory, so you don't HAVE to have an SD card every second.  None of the canon's in my experience work like that.Now to the actual product usage versus a typical canon:We're just starting out, but so far I am a happy camper.  Right off the bat, the zs15 in iA mode takes crisp, clear, bright pictures.  There's not much to say here since it's so new, but it does exactly what I'd like it to, it's simple, and it holds very easily.  I'm looking forward to playing with it more to discover all it's capabilites.There are a couple things I find annoying simply bc I'm not used to them:1. this camera charges the battery IN the camera by plugging into the wall.  I'm used to a seperate charger and multiple batteries so you can charge one while still using the camera.  I was worried this would be the case, but couldn't/didn't find out for sure until I received the camera in the mail.  It's a hassle, but I'll make it work.2. as far as I can tell, you cannot delete a picture in camera mode.  I'm used to being able to delete a picture immediately if it was a crap shot. This will eventually lead to more work later as I tend to take a TON of pictures to get that one good shot of a moving kid.  If that function exists in the zs15, I haven't discovered it yet.There is so much more to compare amongst these cameras, and I just didn't have the time and the knowledge to understand it all, so I'm afraid I can't do it true justice for all you camera/photography buffs.  But for the casual user and someone looking to branch out from canon, I hope I gave you a useful comparison.**UPDATE 10/11/12**After a weekend with a zoo trip and a 2nd birthday celebration with lots of picture taking, I have a couple more observations:1. using the \"scene - baby\" setting on the zs15, some of the pictures appear more washed out than I'm used to when using my old canon with a similar setting.  I suspect this isn't really a camera problem though; I'm thinking it's probably more user error, and the more I get used to the setting, I hope to fix this issue.2. deleting pictures & SD card class - at the zoo I discovered how much I miss being able to delete a picture right away. After a bad shot I would try to switch over to \"picture/viewing\" mode to delete right after and would frequently get a symbol that looked like pictures downloading and a message that I could NOT delete/edit pictures yet.  This became really annoying when I reached the max of my SD card; I just wanted to delete some pictures to make space and move on.  Unfortunately, I got this message multiple times taking several minutes each to actually complete the download.  In the world of kids and animals, those minutes are precious, so I ultimately relied on a family member's camera, and knew to better prepare next time.  Afterwards I remember reading a review about these cameras doing better with a higher class SD card.  I didn't (and still don't) know much about that, but when I discovered a class 10, 8 GB SD card at Walmart for about $15 I went for it.  The class card I had previously was a 4.  So far, I haven't received that \"download\" message at all with this new card.  So you may find a higher class makes a difference for you too.  This was not an issue I had at all with any of my canons, but something I can easily prepare for and get used to working around.", "Date": "September 29, 2012"}, {"Title": "Wonderful point and shoot for under $200 US", "Author": "PoetDoc", "ReviewID": "R1HCE2EQZ9WZA4", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I am really enjoying this camera.

Also, I chose the ZS15 over the ZS20 because I didn't care about GPS and it seemed that the reviews indicated the picture clarity was a smidgen better on the 15. I read a review that complained about this camera in low light situations and I have found with the right settings I have gotten off some amazing shots in low light - but then, I don't have SLR expectations of a limited aperture point and shoot.

I only shoot video about once every two years, so I didn't test that feature.NOTE: I have now had the ZS15 for a couple of weeks and have shot several hundred pictures.  Nothing has happened to change my original comments, except for one observation on full zoom under \"The OK\" below.The good:--Very clean design, functional layout, full controls, well built.--Smooth operation, seems to power up quickly.--Surprisingly good IQ.  Very low noise at low ISO, both indoors and outdoors.  I had good natural light; I don't expect low noise from a P&S; in bad light, so I didn't go there to any extent.  Did take a few shots indoors with flash in fairly low light; flash pictures were good and noise was acceptable.--Very good IS.  Even at slow shutter speeds (1/30) you could get a good clean image.--Beautiful natural colors on WB auto (shooting indoors or outdoors, good natural light).--Nice and compact.  This will make it easy to use with an underwater case.--The Macro is very good.  If you want to be a spy, use this camera to photograph documents.The OK:--Burst at 5fps wasn't 5fps.  It was a bit over 4fps for 4+ frames, then settled in at a steady 2+fps (with some variations and hiccups).  I only continued for 20 seconds, but it appeared capable of continuing until the card fills up.  Not outstanding, but it will do.--Like many P&S; cameras, seriously overexposes in bright natural light.  The solution is simple: set EV at -2/3, ISO 100.  This resulted in perfect exposures and really brought out the excellent natural colors.--In-camera charging is glacially slow and of course you can't charge the battery and use the camera at the same time.  Simple solution: a charger and a spare battery or two.  I always use non-OEM chargers and batteries and never have had a problem.--Can't see the screen in bright sunlight.  Just like any other P&S; LCD--although I think this LCD is a bit easier to see than my old Canon SX100is (which I have sold, mainly for that reason).  I may invest in a hood/magnifier, or Clearviewer.--At full zoom, images are very clean and detailed at 100% or more out to about 150 yards; beyond that distance the small sensor may or may not deliver good detail, depending on the subject, lighting, heat waves, areas of extreme contrast, etc.The bad:--Burst at 10fps wasn't noticeably quicker than 5fps.  I won't bother with this feature.  And at only a few frames at the alleged 10fps, it's not very practical in any case.--AF isn't totally reliable.  At 10fps, it was totally UNreliable.--Really weird smearing of detail at long distances using full zoom.  (Full zoom at shorter distances didn't exhibit this defect.)--No RAW.  This makes it harder to fix any defects in the image.--The flash casts a huge shadow, caused by the lens, on any Macro or closeup.  This is a real design defect, and will definitely limit what you can do with this camera creatively.  Not a problem over a couple of feet away, but it shouldn't exist at all.--When zooming or panning with video, the AF can get confused and take some time to find the right focal length.Many reviewers mention the ZS15's sensor, which is allegedly the same as the sensor in the very good FZ150.  This may be true.  But compared to the FZ150, the JPEGs are smaller (4+mb instead of 5-6mb).  This means less information has been retained, which may be the explanation for some of the problems with smearing.  Also, images taken at the same setting and distance/zoom, weren't as clear with the ZS15.  Some of this could be the lens, some could be in-camera processing.  But the fact is that same sensor or not, the IQ of the ZS15 in most comparable situations is not as good as the FZ150.  Nevertheless, I did get a few shots with IQ indistinguishable from the FZ150 (mainly medium-distance, medium- to full-zoom).  I mention all this for the benefit of people who may have been led to believe that they're getting a mini-FZ150, minus some bells and whistles, at a bargain price.  This camera is pretty good, and a bargain, I think, but it's not a mini-FZ150.Bottom line: I paid $165 new for this camera, and it's definitely worth it.  At full retail ($279) I might well send it back because it has too many issues.

They are the Canon SX260 and this Panasonic ZS15.  In addition to high image quality (the most important feature IMO), both cameras are about the same size (large end of pocketable) and both have about the same optical zoom.  However, there are still reasons to choose the Panasonic ZS15.  The main reason for me (and the one most reviewers never mention) is the extra optical zoom up to 25x if you limit the image size to 5 MPix which is large enough for a quality 8x10 inch print.  Then there is an extra 2x zoom for a total of 50x which is apparently an interpolated digital zoom involving a little image quality degradation.  (The camera has a digital zoom in addition to the 50x which I never use.  I can use digital zoom on a computer after the fact.)  So, with 25x true optical zoom and the ability to get a shot at 50x if necessary, this is an amazing camera.  It has aperture and shutter priority settings as well as manual. These features are also important although the intelligent automatic mode (iA) does well in many conditions.  There is also an intelligent resolution feature which adds beautiful sharpness to many photos.

I was a little reluctant to go with another Panasonic, due to the problems we'd had with the lens covers not working very well after a while, but it seemed the best deal so in the end I went for it.Not only has this camera met all the above criteria, it also did something I didn't expect: it takes fabulous pictures. With our previous camera you often had to try a few different shots or settings to try to get a good picture, and it was particularly difficult to get a good shot with flash; this one I found myself just pointing and shooting and getting a wonderful picture. When you are trying to get pictures of kids who are doing something cute, that's what you want to be able to do! As such I highly recommend this camera.The one time I've found it struggling so far was at a weekend away, where I was trying to zoom in at night to take a picture of (a) a scorpion on the floor in a dimly lit area, and (b) a tarantula on the ceiling, again in a dimly lit area. For obvious reasons, I didn't want to get physically too close in either case!

Its firmware was a little buggy, and although it seemed like they could have improved things with a firmware update, the only thing that was done with the one firmware update they released for it was disabling the use of third party batteries.  That confined anyone who had updated their firmware to Panasonic's own batteries, and they were extremely expensive at the time.  That was enough to make me swear I would never buy another Panasonic product again.After our sz-3 wore out due to abuse, we needed a new pocket camera with a zoom and good video capabilities.  I had determined that the Canon SX-230 was the ideal choice, but after trouble finding one in anything but hot pink or turquoise, I gave this one a look.  Compared to the Canon, it had a better lens and a significantly lower price.  Reviews showed image quality to be significantly better than cameras in the zs line that preceded, and interestingly, even significantly better than the few that had come after it (such as the zs-20).I'm happy to say that the reviews were right.  This camera's image quality hasn't disappointed one bit, and it's low-light performance is (sorry, here it comes)... a night-and-day improvement over the sz-3 (couldn't resist).  The 16x lens, although it has a longer reach, has about the same maximum aperture as the previous 12x one.  So, no real gain there.  The sensor is a different story.  Panasonic usually sabotages the low-light quality of their cameras, negating gains in photo receptor sensitivity by upping the pixel count to levels that no one needs.  Their hope is that uninformed consumers just assume that more pixels = better photo.  The zs-15, however, benefits from a relatively recent advance in sensor technology known as \"backside illumination\", which effectively allows larger photo receptors by eliminating the space between them, and Panasonic applied it to their sensor BEFORE upping the pixel count.  So, the zs-15 has the same 12 megapixels as the previous few cameras in the zs line, but higher sensitivity, and the result is that image quality at 800 ISO is better than our old Panasonic was at 400 ISO.  In fact, 1600 ISO on our new camera is even comparable to 400 on the old one.  Additionally, the manual control offered on the zs-15 is as good as anyone can expect from a pocket camera these days, which is another giant leap beyond the zs-3.  Aside from allowing more control over aperture and shutter speed, this also allows the zs-15 to be pretty effective for night time photography as well, which is something the zs-3 simply couldn't handle.With the improved image quality and low-light sensitivity, the zs-15 is a highly rewarding pocket-zoom, and at the current price, an incredible value.Regarding the zoom capability, the zs line has been pretty good for that.  The lens has a very useful wide-angle to telephoto range, and although it's on the slow side (F3.3 max aperture), I've compared it side-by-side with a current super star in the mega zoom catagory, the Nikon D-510, and found that the zs-15 offered only slightly worse image quality at the long end of the zoom range.  Quite a forgivable difference, considering the zs-15 actually fits in a pocket and is half the price.Low points of the zs-15 include continued use of proprietary connectors Worse still, they DON'T EVEN GIVE YOU ONE OF THEIR PROPRIETARY HDMI CABLES WITH IT!  Or even a battery charger!  They expect you to charge the battery in the camera using the included USB cable (proprietary, of course -- don't lose it!) or wall adapter.  Two pieces of good news, though: extra batteries and chargers can now be bought by themselves very cheaply (just search Amazon, there are tons of options), and, if like me you are upgrading from a zs-3, then you already have a compatible battery and dedicated charger.  We would have even had the compatible HDMI cable from the zs-3 too if we hadn't lost it.  Grrrr...  The flash is also still quite mediocre, but thankfully, now far less necessary due to the ability to use higher ISOs without turning the image into an oil painting.So... regarding value and sensor technology, here's why you should buy this camera right away.  Don't wait for the price to go down.  It won't.  It has already gone up by $35 in the couple of months since I bought it.  And, that's not surprising.  A good pocket camera with respectable low-light performance is very difficult to find.  The uninformed pocket-camera-buying public does not generally reward manufacturers for creating a good sensor rather than just joining the mega-pixel rat-race.  So, cameras like these are often niche products, and they often get replaced by products with worse sensors (but a higher pixel count) and become quite difficult to come by.  This has already happened.  The more recent products in the zs line have been upped to 16MP, as have most of its competitors.  Visit DP Review, compare the zs-15 to the zs-20 at 1600 ISO, and see how much better the zs-15 does.  And, remember lessons learned by the Fuji F31.  The F31 had spectacular light sensitivity for its time, but didn't sell well despite its low $200 price due to its 6MP sensor.  Many competitors were offering more pixels.  A year later, however, new F31s could no longer be found and used ones were fetching $400+ on Amazon.  I'm not saying you should think of the zs-15 as an investment, I'm just saying that if you're considering it, get it now while you can.", "Date": "October 20, 2012"}, {"Title": "Panasonic LUMIX DMC-ZS15 review", "Author": "g9000K", "ReviewID": "R2EHF89I504ULY", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I still use ZS7, but bought this one for my diving trips, after extensive research, because of the video quality along with original Panasonic underwater housing.

It is solely sold as a \"point and shoot\" camera, in which it blows me away for a camera in that category. I'm not an expert, but I am around electronics and technology a lot (mostly gaming and computers) and some of the features this camera has for the price is outstanding.A word about economy. I wouldn't say it is hard to find a good camera. It is just the fact that many retailers offer more \"cheap\" cameras because the cheaper prices attract more foot traffic and more purchases for customers either looking for cameras or passing by them and thinking \"what a good deal\" (not). It is increasingly difficult to find a quality, well made Japanese camera. Many camera manufacturers make their cameras now in China. That is not always bad because many manufacturers sometimes still enforce higher standards of build quality, but you can't beat Japanese made quality in any electronics (cars too).This camera is MADE IN JAPAN. Fantastic!!!! It feels great, has a solid feel while not quite being heavy. The megapixel rating isn't terribly high, however that doesn't matter much unless you are blowing up your picture and making a poster to put up on a wall. I don't do that, i view pictures on my computer and print up 4x6's, 5x7's, and occasionally a 8x10 to frame. What is more important is the image sensor and the size of said sensor.I was amazed when I was taking video how it changes scenes automatically. If i go up close to something it will change to macro mode automatically. It will adjust to outdoor (mountain) setting and also adjust for lower light all automatically. It is also difficult to find a camera in this range that has such fluid zooming capabilities while taking video as this camera graces you with. I was amazed and I took some great outdoor videos by the water and they came out crystal clear in 1080p. Try finding a camera this size, price, and quality that does 1080p video. Most this size only do 720p.Same with taking still pictures. When you put it in IAuto mode which is basically your average auto mode with Panasonic's intelligence system. It works really well. IT switches to macro automatically for you as well.I've had 2 Sonys one Canon and now a Panasonic camera. I have always loved their TV's too.

In the automatic setting, there's a noticeable amount of fisheye distortion that is clearly visible in any close up photo involving lines that should be straight or in portraits, which end up looking like funhouse shots. It took some experimenting, but it turns out that the portrait setting completely corrects this (and you can use it for still life shots, too).

Nice size that feels secure but not bulky in the hand, an attractive design (love that Leica name on the lens). Among my beloved Canon P&S; cameras, none has the zoom capability of this Lumix. I live in the southwest where the landscapes are vast and use a zoom lens often. In recent days I've photographed hot air balloons in the morning in direct sun and the full moon rising over the mountains at dusk. Note: over the years I've photographed the moon with many different P&S; cameras and they all came out wonky and Dali-like, never crisp. These pics came out extremely well considering this is not a DSLR. I switched to macro and tested it with closeups of rings, vitamin pills, flower heads and the words on a prescription bottle. Although the macro feature isn't great, if you hold the lens at just the right distance for sharpness (about 3-4\") the result can be zoomed further and cropped satisfactorily. I've rated the camera with 4 stars due to a flaw that Panasonic has not corrected: the LCD monitor becomes a mirror in bright sunlight. Very disconcerting to aim at something and see only oneself staring back. Other manufacturers have dealt with this problem, why not Panasonic?

This small package LUMIX ZS15 16X point and shoot size sensor zoom camera is great on its own merits.  Just took it three weekends ago to the top of the Colorado Great Divide in Boulder, County, where it soared rendering Aspen and other vegetation subtle fall color changes (used the onboard image enhancement menu to saturate all color tone nuances after the image was shot with two camera menu button pushes).  Not quite a DSLR, but very close to those results in a strictly JPEG imaging motif pocketable camera. A little image sharpening post shooting, and 16X20 standard prints are adjusted in ratio to the format chosen, as very printable.  All the trade offs of sticking with this MP count sensor are apparent in this camera's wise selection of such sensor capacity.Read the specs on Panasonic's site, and know that all claims advertised are true.  The ultimate trail and travel camera for some it is certain.  Not really available with all this feature set until on board processor capacity and memory card structuring aligned with the notion of such a tool's speedy results as on track imaging use advances for 2012.  A better lens than the claimed 20X next model up, with better and more predictable outcomes, and offering considerable override control.Read the other reviews here, and excepting those with virtual ignorance of applying this versatile tool to planned and presenting subject challenges, one will understand the consistent report of its fruitful and faithful imaging consistency.  What I like is carrying it in a pocket all the time, just in case the session for capture includes a newsworthy happenstance coming my way.And here we have it, all is approachable for the potential of future imaging by an experienced eye carried with this imaging unit becoming an extension of one's photographic abilities.  Maximal pocket quality Leica zoom, a great burst capacity, accurate exposure and color, and the best detail possible for such a sized sensor.  This happens where what a photographer loves joins the multicore PC processor computer age for imaging storage, manipulation, and considered post shooting updating for best results sought.The quality of this unit cannot be claimed to be anything but the best, where the manufacturing build is at the top of what is possible for mass marketing and a wide user base in a price range now under $200.00! Panasonic's quality control is not easily matched by other makers. Even professionals can benefit from its adjustablity and handling ease. Enthusiasts too have intelligent automatic settings that can boost their deliverable results according to use location needs.Since the Canon A650 (a G series priced without the beefy body, but with the same lens, adjustment ability, and sensor)--which lacks the ability to control noise and flare after ISO 400 with its now vintage CCD chip (but gives great photos)--these small sized zoom cameras have acquired 1080p or i HD video capacity (this one with the available zoom fully functional while shooting video, as follows focus well too, and with accurate results for HD viewing and/or editing), greater low light capacity, wider dynamic range, all kinds of auto or manual settings to achieve predicable results, plug in considerations for most photo software, full imaging recording data encoding, ability to use HC and HXC SD cards (one of which can now shoot thousands of stills and up to or over 1/2 hour of HD video), with accurate on demand fps rates which work, greater flash and WA coverage, sharp, sharp zoom lenses, color cooking, etc.  Viewfinders too now are like watching a small HDTV all in real time and present on location.The purchase choice and use question becomes then subjective.  Does the camera work for your hands, for your style of shooting, and meet your imaging goals and objectives without further bells and whistles (like ability for add on flash, normally expensive additional greater long reach or wider capacity lens coverage, fine detail only once achieved with a larger sensor interchangeable lens camera, and so on)? As it is this camera should remain a trustworthy companion until pocket cameras in general become even more refined, with greater attributes we can only imagine.The vendor here offered the camera with an inexpensive class 10 16MP SDHC card which has performed flawlessly, with the Case Logic cigarette package sized case with one pocket which has been there when needed to carry extra generic batteries ordered elsewhere, and with the listed Lumix battery (also included was the in camera charger, software, and cables).  As being their suggestions all were essential additions as reasonably priced, and came quickly through the mail along with the camera in a well packaged bundle.

Maybe it's the not-having-to-pay-attention-to-the-popup-flash.  Maybe it's the way the controls are laid out.  Maybe it's the color (my SX230 was red with hot-pink overtones).  Whatever the reason, it feels more comfortable to me.- The user interface is much more intuitive in the ZS15 than on the SX230.  Simple things like escaping from menus is a breeze with the ZS15, whereas I had to figure out by trial-and-error which control button to hit with the SX230.- The ZS15 is much more responsive than the SX230.  It almost feels like the ZS15 is 3X faster than the SX230.  (Probably not true.  It's probably closer to 1.5X faster cycle times.  It just SEEMS that it's three times faster because the moments to take photographs are fleeting.  Or maybe it's that I can take 3 good snapshots with the ZS15, in the time that it would have taken for 1 good shot plus one rushed badly framed snapshop with the SX230.)- The wide angle is such a breath of fresh air.  I missed it so much (my previous camera, a Fujifilm F505, had a 24mm wide angle lens).  Now, I have it back. :-)- Ditto for the in-camera panoramic photostitching (my Fujifilm F505 had that, too).  Not as perfect as doing post-camera stitching, but if I was a perfectionist, I would buy a DSLR.- The intelligent zoom is a plus.  (Note:  The 16x optical zoom of the ZS15 yields about the same picture as the 14x optical zoom of the SX230, because it starts off with a smaller object at the 24mm wide angle setting when compared with the larger starting object at the SX230's 28mm setting).- Video is much nicer, scenes are better rendered.  And I can HEAR the audio on playback in the camera!  (The SX230's volume was nearly inaudible.)- The ZS15's 4:3 LCD display is much easier on my eyes than the SX230's 16:9 LCD display.While the SX230 arguably produces better photographs, the ZS15 is easier and more fun for me to use.  5 stars.", "Date": "August 8, 2012"}, {"Title": "Great camera with a lot of issues", "Author": "okaugust \"okaugust\"", "ReviewID": "R3D1UCN24OPTFK", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "I'm not professional photographer, but I must be doing something right, people keep asking me what kind of camera I use. I tell them a Panasonic Lumix, but it's my fourth or fifth because it is continually having issues. I keep thinking it must be me, though I try to be careful with how I handle it, but reading other reviews with my exact issues I just had to conclude it is not me, it is the camera design.The lenses are always getting scratched by particles that get trapped by the auto closing lens door, and scratching the lens.Each one also works okay for a few months but in the end, there are particles that get trapped inside the lens, creating a blob on pictures. This time I was so frustrated that I gave it a few thwacks with my fingers until it moved out of the range of view.Don't even think about getting it anywhere remotely damp.You have to know how to change the video setting because one way won't download right. The tech people won't know either, no matter how many times you say, \"it has just got to be switched on the wrong setting\" they will tell you to reformat your computer or send it in.Oh, and every time I've called for warranty help, it's $180-$225 to fix, the price of a new camera. (That's what happens when someone buys it in November for you for Christmas, and when it goes out the next December it's over the year warranty.) Only I don't put up with that. I tell them it's a product flaw, and I'm sending it back. They can fix it and send it back to me for free or keep it, and every time they've fixed it and sent it back for free. However, the warranty process and people are so confusing and hard to work with, you never know if they will just keep it, or if you will get a bill for $180, or what's going to happen.Other people are right, it doesn't take that great of shots in really bright light, or really low light on the automatic setting.Getting something in movement is impossible.It has less settings than the previous versions I had.It's a $200 camera met for average morons like me who want to carry it around, point and shoot, and come home with a pretty good picture, and 80% of the time it does that, it just doesn't last or lend itself to making the other 20% of the time happen.", "Date": "March 23, 2014"}, {"Title": "Phenomenal camera i'm on my third one", "Author": "Brad Hutchinson", "ReviewID": "R387NU68OYMWE6", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I have been a user of the Panasonic superzoom models for years now an all of them have been excellent.

My main uses for the camera are wildlife/nature photography and landscape photography while hiking.  I carry this camera typically in a small Pearstone bag and use the chest strap on a Camelbak to hold the camera bag via the belt clip.  I will never own a DSLR because I hike as light as possible and do not have the patience or room to haul around multiple lenses anywhere.  Why bother when I can have this camera hanging by my chest and take excellent pictures?  As a tip use the \"Vivid\" color mode for any of the Panasonic superzoom cameras it produces the highest quality images and sharp colors while the normal mode is somewhat bland.If you own a Panasonic superzoom camera sooner or later you are going to get dust/dirt behind the lens on the CCD sensor.  My recommendation to you is to search on Youtube and you will find a very well done instructional video on how to clean that sensor.  Prior to going on a trip or somewhere important make sure to clean the sensor in advance so that all your pictures are not ruined by that tiny piece of dirt. On a previous Panasonic model I sent the camera back to Panasonic repairs to clean the sensor for me and it took them over 2 months both times, while it takes me less than 5 minutes after learning how do not waste your time with their warranty service for the CCD sensor cleaning.", "Date": "February 19, 2014"}, {"Title": "Excellent camera for the snap shooter", "Author": "Feathermcht", "ReviewID": "R3KYHXNBRJY5KT", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "we use it constantly.  the computer software is a little cumbersome, but it's learnable with a little experimentation.

No recommendations of it being essential to buy an extended warranty here.  The camera is small enough to ensure I take it with me, takes fantastic pictures and is easy to use.  I took my first 50 pictures without reading the instructions (I always think you should be able to do this).  I like the separate slide switch for on-off, how many times I switched off my other camera instead of taking a picture - two buttons close to one another!  There is another slide switch that changes the camera from taking to viewing pictures - simple and foolproof.

Brost \"mercerguy323\"", "ReviewID": "R3LHD8L2ALNQQ4", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Bought this camera a while ago and have had a chance to use it a bit before commenting here. First, let me say that the camera is replacing an older Canon SX 150IS. There are things I miss on the Canon but, think the picture quality from this camera is better. The camera powers up faster and is smaller than my Canon. I used the Panoramic setting for the first time and it came out great! I cannot comment on battery life as I use the Manual setting to take my photos and rarely use the flash. Not using the flash saves my battery life and using Manual allows me to set my exposure. Unfortunately, this is where my biggest gripe and possibly only one comes into play.This camera has an exposure meter on it that you view on the LED and it is helpful for getting what the camera says is the accurate exposure for your photo before you snap the picture. It's in the form of a sliding scale that when the setting is centered, indicates that you have the perfect exposure. The problem is, you have to go through the additional step of pressing the exposure button before adjusting your settings to the perfect exposure. This not only takes time, valuable time you may need to get the shot but, if you happen to forget to push the exposure button it takes you to either the auto bracket or timer setting choices. Not what you wanted and more wasted time. You then have to back out of the mistaken choice and then remember to hit the exposure button and then adjust accordingly.There is another way to \"engage\" the exposure settings and I find myself doing this more often rather than hitting the exposure button first. By depressing the shutter half way the exposure is hilighted and engaged, ready for you to make your adjustments to the shutter speed or aperture. BTW, the adjustments are made using the round disc on the camera with pressing up or down adjusting the shutter speed and the left and right adjusting the aperture setting. I find that if I am at all close on my settings then their usually isn't much adjusting needed. My Canon didn't require this extra step and thus I was ready to snap the picture sooner with it.Other than that small frustrating glitch, I would buy this camera again and again. It takes great photos, is fast to start, focuses fast and is medium in size. It fits in your pocket, just not like the really slim ones.

In addition it is a bit bulky to be toting around to family events.  My video camera is of the old tape type and it was always uncomfortable having to carry a video camera and a still camera.  The Lumix DMC-ZS15 does both really well and easily fits in my coat pocket.  It will not get all the low-light photos my SLR will get but it will get great photos in daylight and wonderful videos even indoors.  It is a fine point and shoot camera which is much easier to carry while visiting friends or out in the park with family.For video I mainly use it for my two son's wrestling and judo meets which are always indoors in large gyms.  Even in a large gym when I was on the opposite end, the 16X was all (or more than) I needed.  Most of the time I was happy with 10X-12X.  It shakes enough at 16X I cant imagine using a larger magnification.  The \"SH\" video is superb.  I didn't try the AVCHD because the SH is so good for my purposes - viewing on a 19\" monitor.I use Window's \"Movie Maker\" to edit which suits my basic needs fully.  For still photos you need more light than for video which is understandable since there are more pixels in the still photo.Get a spare set of batteries since video and some flash stills will drain your battery pretty fast.

On a recent trip I saw other people's photos and noted how beautiful some of them were, and I noticed my phone was taking better pictures than my camera and realized digital photography had gotten a lot better.  This camera does a lot more than I'm ever going to use, but the basic functions I was looking for were 1) a great lens and 2) a camera that would be smart enough to take in all aspects of my surroundings and take a great shot.  I know photography and I travel a lot.  I find most times when I take photos, events are happening and I want to point and shoot immediately without a lot of setup.  This camera does that and does it well.  I took a while and read the book and set up the auto features, and now leave the camera on \"intelligent auto\" all the time.  The lens and autofocus do a great job both indoors and out, and I've gotten lots of excellent photos in fairly low light situations too where I wasn't expecting to get much of a shot.  I have used a couple of the special modes, e.g. the panorama mode works very well and the burst mode takes a nice series of shots, but mostly it's just point and shoot.  When I'm traveling, I don't want to live my life through the lens of a camera - I want to experience it and snap a picture or two to take along for memories.  Battery life is fair.  If you do a lot of shooting, get an extra battery or two, and you might consider getting a charger as well so you don't have to use the camera for charging.  I got the Wasabi Power Battery (2-Pack) and Charger and they worked well.  I keep the camera in a case in my pocket or on my belt.  I just returned from a trip overseas for 2 months and took over 2500 pictures.  I am more than satisfied with the results.  Not all were terrific, but with my method of shooting you cannot expect more.  Where I took a little extra time in odd lighting conditions, I got some pretty spectacular shots.

Photos can be uploaded by i-photo to a mac computer or to an IOS device, but control of that is not great. Bigger problem is uploading movies.

I did not see clear instructions about this on Panasonic's site or on the boards. There seem to be some work arounds if you have your desktop version of itunes. Ipad particularly makes transfering images difficult since it doesn't have a usb port -- the adapter did not work on the memory stick for me. Probably best to skip if you want to take video and work with mac/apple products.This may be more of a problem on the Apple side, but it seems a camera maker would want their equipment to work more easily with those systems and if it's a file structure question, at least give a set up option for mac users.

In low light, it was very difficult to take decent pictures, even with the appropriate settings. I had a much better experience with this using a Fujifilm finepix camera which was easy to set up manually, had a useful \"nighttime\" setting, and it took beautiful low-light pictures. Also, the battery life on this camera is NOT impressive. Also, my old Fujifilm was much faster.All of that I could live with since I just wanted a decent point-and-shoot with good zoom, but the real trouble began when the LCD screen developed problems while under warranty. A day or two before an overseas trip, the camera simply stopped responding, and all I could see on the screen were vertical colored lines. Terrible timing, and a big surprise because it had worked perfectly the day before. It's a good thing I had my old Fujifilm to fall back on. I sent it in for repairs (it was under warranty!) and it has taken OVER 5 MONTHS to receive the promised refund.I have called and called to find out from the customer service rep with an attitude about the status of my refund only to be told that it takes 4-6 weeks to send a check!

Provided you plan ahead you won't mind having this camera with you on a once-in-a-lifetime trip.  For example, if you buy this camera I'd recommend that you also buy the Panasonic DE-A65BA Battery Charger.  Panasonic's default method of charging the camera is to use a laptop and their proprietary USB cable.  Well, that's great if you are planning to lug your laptop around the world but not so good if the addition of a laptop complicates your travel.To really use the maximum zoom of the camera you'll want to set it to about 5 megapixels. The image will be grainy but you can a least see what the heck is out there.  And I mean out there. If you are thinking I'm suggesting using the camera as a sort of ersatz monocular, you are right.The camera does not include a decent in-camera editing solution. This is a basic model so take your snaps and manipulate the images with your smartphone, tablet, notebook, or tablet.

No taking 3 or 4 shots to get it right (like the Canon S95 or S100), it will be right the first time.This is my choice for a great zoom. But when I do not need the 16 times zoom I use the camera I really love, the Fujifilm F100fd.

There is a rather different set of available options in every shooting mode, which means that if I want to do something special that I once did, I need to figure out which dial setting to start from. I suppose eventually I will be able to remember my favorites, but....  Also, it is much too easy to inadvertently change critical settings such as picture quality and movie format while fat-fingering the cursor controls. Unfortunately the .pdf manual is not a model of clarity either, causing much head-scratching.On the plus side, I'm extremely impressed with the video performance, both in .mp4 and AVCHD/Lite modes.

We tested the SX40 and it is a good camera if a bit big and pricy for a P&S; superzoom (35x).  The ZS15 came down to a very low $179 and seemed to offer much for the price.  Out of the box and away we went on a test.  Photos in sunlight were good.  16x pictures were not as good as the others as we had to step back to get it to focus (as much as 6.6 feet per the camera!) and, more importantly, a few pictures had blur (more than with the SX40 at 25x --- probably because we used the viewfinder).But the biggest problem --- low light photography/video.  Pics were primarily dark.  And blur at 16x in low light a real issue even for those with steady hands.  Slow shutter = blurry pics and fast shutter = dark pics.  Surprising and unless there is a magic button (yes, the IS is on and digital zoom off), this will probably go back.  The Panny seems to like yellow and red colors, too.Video is nothing special on this Panny, especially at night.  Maybe on the FZ150 or ZS20 with their 60p; this has 30p or so.  Insult to injury --- the battery lost power quickly and we had to recharge it in camera (Not so with the SX40 or cheap Canons such as the Elph 300).Not all is bad is this possibly bad copy.  As mentioned the low price.  The shutter speed is exceptional.  Much faster than the SX40.  Perhaps even faster than our G12.  10x continuous at full resolution.  Very impressive.  iAuto not bad but often defaults to a noisy 3200 ISO (change the setting to max at 800).  White balance is not great.  HDR good concept but may need tripod (or very steady hands).We're bummed as we could have saved almost $200.  I don't think we'll try another small superzoom (maybe the SX260 but that seems overpriced for what it is) and Panasonic confuses things with it's more expensive ZS20.Try the SX40 before buying just to get an idea of the differences --- including 35x optical zoom vs. 16x.If it were cheaper we would probably own the Panasonic FX150.  We want good pictures (IQ), not small size or daylight only use.  $179 is a great price but we'd rather spend another $50 and get good pics most of the time and be able to take good pics at night.UPDATE:  To be fair, I tested this camera at 5x zoom vs. a Canon Elph at 5x zoom (its max).  The Elph is smaller, cheaper, more elegant (I think), and has a charger.  Image quality --- I took indoor pics of the same things.  The Elph's pics were sharper/less blurry (e.g., reading the contents on a vitamin bottle) and had nicer colors (less dark, more vibrant pics).  Also, more noise in the ZS15 pics (e.g., iAuto was at ISO 3200 often vs. Elph's typical indoor ISO 400).  I was disappointed.  I want to like this camera.  I suppose it's a good buy for 16x with its limitations but it's not for us.  We'll do without a superzoom (cropping works well as a substitute) or get a good, more expensive superzoom.  In the interim, I would recommend the Elph 310 --- it has 8x zoom --- and does everything well enough --- including  low light pics/video.  (About the same price.)Good luck!Update:  Update of a sort.  The ZS8 which is at least somewhat similar to this camera (looks, same body?), 16x lens, same price for a day at least, probably a different sensor has sold well and has many one-star reviews --- many mention broken cameras (OK, that happens) and, worse, Panasonic refusing to fix when under warranty.

A couple months ago,  I accidentally left my 4 year old Lumix camera on the hood of the car.  It didn't bounce well on the gravel drive, and I wiped out the digital screen.  That said,  I KNOW they are fragile.  So when I ordered this replacement camera,  I was especially careful with it.  I babied it in padded pockets and protected it inside a rigid purse.  So on vacation last month, imagine my horror when I took my two week old Lumix out of it's protective purse and found the screen totally damaged beyond any recognition! There was nothing else in the purse to cause damage-  I can only assume pressure from the side of the purse caused the problem.  I still used it (LOVE the zoom)  but it was almost like shooting with my eyes closed.  I was glad I had brought along my water proof/shock proof Lumix for a back up.I don't know what else to say.  I'm angry that a compact, pocket sized camera can't endure a pocket or purse without severe damage. I wish I had been forewarned... I could have applied a protective film (like I have on my cell phone).  I can't justify $150 expense to replace the screen...  the whole camera was just a little more than that!

Good compacts include the Panny LX5, new Panny LX7, Nikon P7100, Oly XZ-1, Canon G-series, S90, S95, and a few others.  Other good cameras with small sensors include the Panny FZ150 (24x zoom) and Canon SX40 (35x zoom).  A few Sony P&Ss; are decent (HX200, HX20).  I'm sure I've missed some.ZS15:  Well priced, good company, 16x zoom in a small size (compact).ProOutdoor pics in sun are usually good (sharp, good colors) --- although cheap LCD hard to see in outdoor sunFast shutter speed (1/4000)Fast camera (usually)PASM controlsDecent build qualityOnly 16x zoom  Digital zoom is, of course, useless (just blows pics up)Good priceGood OISConIndoor pics usually too dark or blurry (unusable in both cases)  ---  ruins the camera at any price  this occurred in iA or when being more sophisticated (such as using a slow shutter speed to let more light in);  used flash to no avail; tripod made little differenceiA sometimes does weird things --- 1600 ISO or 3200 ISO in sun outdoors on occasion (of course resulting in too much noise and ruining shot)No RAWSoft corners, especially when zoom used6.6 feet closest one can get when using macroLCD screen is 460,000 but poor quality (one can see one's face in the sun making it impossible to take a shot)Colors under artificial lighting suffer form a Panny malady, only more than typically (whites turn into yellows and so on) --- serious weaknessPoor white balanceSo-so user interfacePanny is known for good video (as is Sony); this is 30fps (30p); one wants 60p (not 30p or 60i) --- video is average at bestI tried everything with this camera due to price and a few nice features (speed, although AutoFocus can be slow at zoom).  But a camera that has a high % of losers except under perfect conditions (strong sun) is of modest use.  A camera that cannot take good pics (or video) in low light is just about useless.  Often, a difference between a good camera and a bad camera is in inability to take good shots under challenging lighting conditions.  This is worse.  Moderate lighting conditions and artificial lighting (such as always encountered indoors) show this camera's inadequacies such that it should not be purchased --- at any price.I know it has 16x zoom.  But even as one's only camera it fails.  For a bit more money, I recommend the Canon 300HS or Canon 310HS (8x).  If size is key the just mentioned cameras are very small, too (indeed smaller).  The Canon 300HS, in particular is terrific for its price and size.  If you have more money and want superzoom, the Canon SX260 (20x) is better in low light and small.  Elegant, full metal body.  But it costs more.  The Sony HX20 is a pricy compact but very nice and has full 60p audio/visual (that is, excellent video).If one really wants a superzoom, the small sensors limit what they can do.  (Big sensors are in DSLRs --- 400% the size of a P&S; sensor!).  It makes a dramatic difference, contrary to what some reviewers on here say.  (I know, I've had and used many cameras and am friends with pros.)  Back to superzooms --- the FZ150 (24x) and SX40 (35x) take very good shots.  Both are good in low light, have good IQ unlike the ZS15, and the FZ150 has excellent video.  (Note:  The FZ150 is being discontinued so don't wait and prices have come down --- not cheap but maybe the only camera you'll ever need.)If you have the money and desire, right now one can get a Nikon D3100 (DSLR) with two lenses (15-55 and 55-200) for $649.  Not cheap but you'll be set for a very long time and almost all photos will come out looking great.  Put it on Auto and shoot away or use PASM controls and learn how to take truly great pictures.  DSLRs have large sensors (low noise, etc...), are well built, last long, can take a different lens, are very fast (action photos will be great), have great viewfinders, have excellent LCDs, hold their value (especially the glass), and have other advantages over P&Ss.;  Two disadvantages --- initial price and size (the D3100 is not that big or heavy).  Many have one DSLR and one compact (usually an S95 or something like that).I'm giving you the real deal info.  And, remember, after an initial purchase price, there is no film to develop and no film to buy.  The price difference is less than it seems.P.S.  A used/refurbished DSLR or good superzoom like the FZ150 (wait a month or so as it is being replaced) or SX40 or D3100 or T3 or T2i can be a steal!Good luck to you!!!", "Date": "August 3, 2012"}, {"Title": "Camera great, service terrible", "Author": "James Smith", "ReviewID": "RW2X9ADQ0A90G", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "The camera is great.
