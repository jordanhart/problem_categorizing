{"Reviews": [{"Title": "The DUAL image stabilizer DOES make a difference!", "Author": "Amazon Customer", "ReviewID": "R1CQBBQLSV2IC3", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I'm more of a DSLR guy (I have a Nikon D50 and D200) and I was looking for a simple point-and-shoot camera to bring along to simple occasions rather than lugging my DSLR around. I made the big mistake of buying an Olympus FE-230 which only had Digital Stabilization. Now, all the digital image stabilization did with that particular Olympus camera was boost the sensor's sensitivity and boost the ISO - which left some really really noisy/grainy pictures. I returned the FE-230 and took the 15% restocking fee penalty and exchanged it for the Olympus Stylus 760. Talk about night and day. The Dual Image Stabilizer made low light shots look terrific MINUS the noise. I would have to say that the stabilizer is not perfect (in my experience, Canon has the best Image Stabilizer for a point-and-shoot camera that I've used - the drawback is that Canon is EXPENSIVE) - but I'd rather have Olympus's Dual Image Stabilizer rather than just the typical Digital Image Stabilizer on most of Olympus's line of point-and-shoot cameras. The colors I've taken with the 760 are moderately saturated and are moderately sharp. Nothing but a few post processing magic can fix of course. If you're going to buy an Olympus point-and-shoot camera, make sure you pay the extra $$$ for the Dual Image Stabilizer NOT the Digital Image Stabilizer - it DOES make a difference in photo quality! Definitely worth the money I paid for it!", "Date": "March 17, 2007"}, {"Title": "Snap-tastic!", "Author": "B. Werner", "ReviewID": "R3FGSIJJAJSK4Z", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This is a great camera. I previously purchased an Olympus Stylus 720SW, which is the waterproof/shockproof camera.  While it was extremely durable, it took horrible pictures.  My main problem with it was the \"image stablization\" feature... if you DIDN'T use it, your pictures would turn out blurry due to camera shake... if you DID use it, your pictures would turn out blurry due to changing the ISO.  Everything changed with this camera, however...It has DUAL image stablization, so blurry/grainy pictures don't happen.  This camera also has \"Scene\" selections, so you can pick which scene works best for your moment, whether it's candlelight, indoor, outdoor, etc.  (ironically, it also has an \"underwater\" feature similar to the 720SW, and while it is water resistant in rain, it is definitely NOT submersable).  The reason I have to rave about this camera is it has an incredibly handy feature called \"Guide\", which as th name implies essentially guides you through options in order to take the best picture.  Shooting against backlight and don't know what to do?  No problem, it recommends setting the fill-in flash, and by recommend I mean sets does it for you.  A great camera for those that don't like to think too hard about taking a picture... let the camera do all the thinking! This camera is incredibly user friendly.  I couldn't be more pleased with it.", "Date": "March 1, 2007"}, {"Title": "Great little camera!!!", "Author": "Concerned One \"Thrashfan\"", "ReviewID": "R3FZFSDHAXZ4SZ", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Compact so it fits in you pocket, high tech enough to dance with it's bigger counterparts. This little camera does it all. I comparison shopped for several weeks comparing and contrasting multiple cameras from cannon, kodak, hp, sony, panasonic, and olympus, and none had features like this, a small size, and in this price range. The upgrades form the old 710 stylus is the dual image stabilization, for shake free photos.  The old stylus only had digital stabilization. Zoom is 3x optical and 5x digital, which is lower than the stylus 740 and 750, but still has the dual stabilization.7.1megapixels, Dual image stabilization (both digital and optical stabilization for shake free pictures new for the 750 and 760 models), 2.5 inch lcd viewing screen, and a low price what you get. OH, DID I MENTION EXCELLENT PICTURES. I have played with this for several days now editing the photos, paling with the on-board and the computer imaging package, and I see nothing wrong with this camera for an everyday average user like me. And with it's weather resistence, nice for a clumsy average user like me. Also the battery life is very adequate, about 120 photos or more, with slide shows, editing ect... This is well worth the investment, saving your families memories in a fit and proper manner.Also, the Olympus Mastersoftware is very easy to use, And with panoramic feature, 3d, and Extra ART Features unlocked by Olympus Brand-Olympus Stamped Type H HD, this camera becomes even more of a pleasure to own. you can edit photos on the computer, or right in the palm of your hand.

I have always been more than satisfied with Olympus quality and this camera is no exception.  We still own a C-740 Ultra Zoom which has taken GREAT pictures for us on our trips to Nat'l Parks out west.  I wanted this one for the size convenience, the MP's and the video feature to take backpacking with us.  Pictures have been great, as expected and the video is fun to play with especially if you have Apples iDVD or iMovie to create with!  Camera is very user friendly and the Olympus Master 2 software for photos is nice.

Things that I used to spend hours on in the store when I was developing my pictures I can now do on the camera!

The camera got wet a few times and was exposed to tropical heat, humidity and sea spray - it still works fine!  The battery charger for this camera is small and light - it worked fine on the cruise ship - I didn't use the charger in Australia or New Zealand where the power supply was 230 volts at 50 cycles (US is 110v at 60 cycles.

While I love my old Olympus, I wanted to replace it with something a little smaller and lighter. I have been very disappointed with the new 760 - the pictures are terrible! I even took the first one back, thinking it was defective (the new one is a little better). I have done a number of comparison shots between my old digital and the 760 and the 760 shots are much worse in all lighting conditions! I have been able to fix some of the problems with the Olympus software, but I can't do that for every shot I take. The problems are bad blurring of any movement of the camera or subject in lower light conditions (dusk and indoor incandescent lighting) even with the anti-vibration turned on. Even in good, outdoor lighting the camera is sometimes out of focus, poor auto read of lighting balance, and then there is that viewscreen which is useless outdoors.
