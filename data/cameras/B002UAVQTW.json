This camera was given to my daughter as a gift and we have had more problems than I can count with it.  Not only does it not hold a charge (lasts about an hour), the batteries that you need to use are AAA.  I have spent so much money on batteries that it has surpassed the value of the camera.The picture quality is also bad.  It is grainy and it can't even register when to use a flash properly when in 'automatic' mode.  I have tried all of the suggestions in the camera manual, and none have improved the quality of pictures desired.PROS:* cheap price* sleek designCONS:* the quality of photos shows how cheap this camera is* memory card is NOT included* drains batteries within hours", "Date": "August 17, 2013"}, {"Title": "dont buy", "Author": "cd", "ReviewID": "RCOU37BWEU8B8", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "i bought this thinking it might be ALRIGHT. not only is the quality HORRIBLE but the camera uses AAA batteries.... seriously? after i saw that i knew i was returning it. so dont bother.", "Date": "April 11, 2012"}, {"Title": "cute camera", "Author": "Melba I.
