{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Doesn't get much better than this for a Point & Shoot", "Author": "I.Peters", "ReviewID": "R2FEJC1LJF1JK0", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "The Lumix DMC-ZS9 is my 7th digital point & shoot and my third Panasonic ( I also own a Panasonic Lumix DMC-FH20 (Violet), and a Panasonic Lumix DMC-S1 (Black)). After playing with it for a while, these are my thoughts:PROS- Features:I got this camera as a lightning deal here on Amazon and was very pleasantly surprised what all it offers for the price (even when one buys it at regular price it is still impressive). There is the Leica lens, for starters. Cheaper Panasonic cameras usually do not have Leica lenses so I am very happy. Moreover, the wide-angle is 24 mm - very nice as well. Add to that the 16x optical zoom, the Power image stabilization and the ability to shoot with Aperture priority, Shutter priority, Manual, Program and Panasonic's own iA mode (Intelligent Auto mode) and a variety of more or less useful Scene modes, the HD video capability, and many other features such as Macro and Macro Zoom mode, and one really gets a full-featured, very compact camera with a quality lens for a very good price.- Custom Modes:I like that this camera allows me to assign two of my preferred Scene modes to positions on the dial on top of the ZS9. My DMC-FH20 also has scene modes but I cannot assign them to any buttons, etc. This is definitely progress and appreciated. I tend to mostly photograph landscapes and pets, so my MS1 (stands for My Scene Mode 1) is set to Landscape mode, MS2 to Pet mode. In addition to that, the camera allows the photographer to define custom settings with all sorts of combinations to satisfy users who want more than just take pictures with the pre-programmed scene modes.- Scene Modes:These include almost every scene imaginable - from Portrait / Portrait Soft Skin to Food, Party, Candlelight, Landscape, Sports etc. and gimmicks such as Transform which elongates or widens motifs/subjects. There is a scene mode there for everyone, I'm sure of it...- Auto Focus:Very fast and accurate. I have not had any trouble to get it to lock, even in low-light, low-contrast situations. This is something I really value in a point & shoot because few things are more frustrating than not being able to get the camera to focus on the motif.- Easy Operation:As mentioned above, this is my third Panasonic Lumix, so I am rather familiar with the operation of their cameras. But I think that anyone would find operating this camera rather straightforward, unless the person is a total beginner or has not had much if any experience with digital cameras. Sure, there are always instances where one would have to consult the manual, but every-day point & shoot operation should not require too much thumbing through that. Note that the hard-copy manual that comes in the box only explains the very basics. The complete user manual comes in PDF format on the CD that is in the box.CONs (if one wants to call it that)- As with all cameras in this price range/class, I found that image noise and general image quality is very dependent on the zoom setting, even at lower ISO settings such as ISO100. While the camera shoots very well at short focal lengths and low ISO settings, it sometimes does not so well at long (digital) focal lengths. This is not too much of an issue when printing regular 4 x 6 or 5 x 7 prints but enlarging an image that was taken at full zoom will likely be problematic. Even with the Leica lens, I do not see a noticeable improvement in image quality when comparing it to my simpler and older DMC-FH20. While disappointing, this is also to be expected, and image noise is a sensor issue anyway. There is probably not a camera in this class out there that does not have the same problem. I am only mentioning this to be comprehensive.- Weight & Size. Don't get me wrong - the ZS9 is a small and lightweight camera but it still is bigger and heavier than for example the FH20. It is clear to me that it would have to be a bit heavier and bigger, considering the many more features the ZS9 has in comparison to the FH20. I am mentioning this only in case weight and size is the top priority for a reader. This camera is definitely not shirt-pocket material and I am not sure I'd be too comfortable carrying it in my jeans pocket either. Jacket pockets should generally be OK though ;-).- The color/surface. Call me nit-picky, but I LOVED the brushed metal surface of my FH20 as well as the fact that it came in several colors (my choice was violet at the time). While the ZS9 looks like it is made of high quality materials, I miss the classy brushed metal look and would have preferred almost any other color over the black. But in the end this is really strictly personal preference.SUMMARYI am very happy with this camera. I believe it is the ideal device for my primary purpose, which is using it as a compact travel camera. As a matter of fact, the ZS8 (the almost identical twin to the ZS9) is called TZ18 in Europe, TZ standing for Travel Zoom. This best describes the area where this camera shines. It isn't an SLR and will not produce SLR quality images but for the money, convenience and the quality it provides in its class, I'd be hard pressed to find a better camera.", "Date": "November 15, 2011"}, {"Title": "Great photos and so easy to use", "Author": "lrquade", "ReviewID": "RQOA5CMKZS4PA", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I wanted a digital camera that I didn't have to mess with all the settings to take a picture. The reviews kept saying how easy this camera was to use so I bought it. I took it on vacation without even reading through the manual and it was so easy to use. My pictures came out so beautiful that I surprised myself. Everyone commented what an amazing photographer I was which made me laugh because all I did was leave it on the \"intelligent mode\" which basically lets the camera decide what setting it thinks it should use. The zoom is amazing. After 3 different digital cameras I am finally happy with my choice. I would definitely recommend this camera.", "Date": "November 22, 2011"}, {"Title": "Poor low light performance", "Author": "utahphil", "ReviewID": "R2GA2P1UKC5ZR5", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "Okay, first off I bought this during the lighting deal at $149.  I was concerned with everyone saying Amazon had made a mistake and that this was the ZS8. Well I just got it and it says it is the ZS9.  The manual (which is made for the ZS8 and ZS9) appears to suggest the sole difference between the two is that the ZS9 does stereo recording in video while the ZS8 only allowed for mono.  So, Amazon did not make a mistake.  ZS9 is written write on top of the camera.  Found it odd Panasonic's own web site did not mention the ZZ9.**Update 11/19/11.  Camera continues to work well.  I have never expected much from flashes on point and shoot cameras but this one seems to have less output than most.  If you plan on shooting with a lot of flash I am not sure this would be the best camera (though I try to never use the flash anyway).  I also learned that firmware on some of the Panasonic cameras (and I believe this one) prevent the use of third party less expensive batteries (ugh).  If you are like me and stock up on cheap extra batteries you may want to look into this as an issue.  The Panasonic battery runs about $33 bucks while one can usually find third party batteries around the $10 range.**Updated 11/26/11.  After having enough time with the camera I decided that the flaws, at least in my situation, made this a camera not suited for my use.  My house tends to be darker with a majority of the lighting coming from incandescent light.  The low light photo quality was just not very good.  Even when using the flash on auto the camera would sometimes set an ISO of 800 which I could not understand.  At ISO 800 the pictures have noticeable noise.  I would say that the low light quality even with flash would be best for facebook, etc.  I would be afraid to blow them up to anything maybe beyond a 4x6.  I also had an opportunity to review the video quality.  I had once tried a Canon 230 HX and that quality was simply great.  I did not see anywhere near that quality indoors - but perhaps it is a light issue once again.  If you are planning on mainly shooting in the outdoors I am sure this may be a great option.  However, if you are looking for a small camera that can be used in all lighting conditions a back sided CMOS camera may be a better option.  I am still trying to find that perfect fit between my old Canon ELPH and my Canon T1i SLR.  Still looking for something that fits right in the middle.", "Date": "November 12, 2011"}, {"Title": "The picture quality is FANTASTIC!", "Author": "D.

Most of the shots have been of my grandchildren and pets but I am amazed at the clarity of the pictures! This is not my first Panasonic Lumix point and shoot camera, it is actually my third! The others have taken fantastic pictures when we went on a Mediterranean cruise, clear, concise shots of butterflies and flowers when we were in the Caribbean, and we captured some very precious moments when our twin grandsons were born! In a well lit room the color and clarity is perfect. In a dimly lit room the colors are more muted unless you are taking a portrait shot.I absolutely love the zoom, which is the only reason why I purchased another Lumix!

Roe", "ReviewID": "R1C3DB4N02AKY5", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Ok, Not comparable to my SLR but for an inexpensive point and shoot I am very impressed! Amazon is currently at $130 with free shipping! I purchased it for my wife who needs something very easy and intuitive to operate and this more than fills the bill. Even she has been able to navigate the menu without opening the instructions, largly due to the integrated \"Help\" which is a scrolling line of text which explains each menu item you are viewing. However she likes the selection wheel Panasonic has on many of their cameras which can be used in addition to menu navigation. I don't think many other cameras of this type have that wheel. Intellegent Auto (iA) is great, automatically selecting the appropriate scene setting, and you can program modes and scenes you use often. There are a large number of auto scene modes to chose from. 16x zoom (21x \"intelligent zoom\") is really versatile and the optical image stabilization allows the user to obtain good results at the maximum zoom setting. I have read reviews which state that this camera has a better sensor for low light situations than the much more expensive ZS10 which has GPS and a few more features I knew my wife would never utilize. Also this camera has much better battery life which is important to her. We are perfectly happy with the results from the video also and like that the zoom functions when shooting video. My only complaint so far (hardly worth mentioning)is that the symbols on the 4 way toggle to select flash, macro etc. are etched and not painted a different color so can be difficult to read for someone like my wife who is somewhat admittedly techncally challenged and likes things easy to read. I feel this is a great value and more than meets our expectations.", "Date": "December 21, 2011"}, {"Title": "Another Panasonic Camera Winner!", "Author": "Oceanhut", "ReviewID": "R2IAJV744ZZY5S", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "After almost three and a half years of use, I decided it was time to upgrade and purchase a new Panasonic Lumix camera. The only difference that I could find between the Panasonic Lumix ZS9 and the higher priced ZS10 was that the ZS10 has a GPS, which I didn't feel I needed. So, after reading the many reviews for this particular Panasonic model, I ordered it, and two days later I was on my way to Times Square and Rockerfeller Center with my new camera, to enjoy the sights and sounds of this holiday season. Without having time to throughly review the detailed instructions, I put the camera into \"Intelligent Mode\" (and using the \"Zoom\"), I started clicking away! WOW! The pictures are bright, clear, and the colors are incredible. Using the same \"mode\", the pictures I took at night of the various lighted billboards in Times Square are fantastic. The battery life is exceptional, and lasted through four days of day and night photos. I played around with the various camera features, and discovered that in the \"playback mode\", the still photos can be turned into videos, with music, while in the disc inside the camera! Amazing!  Also noted was the ability to add decorative frames to the photos. I am not professional photographer, or even a camera buff,  but instead a retired grandmother who loves taking family and vacation photos.The price that Amazon is now selling this camera for, with all the features that it offers, is unbelievable! A few days after I purchased this camera from Amazon, the price went down and I received a credit for the difference.  Yesterday, the price was cut again for the holidays, and again Amazon issued me a credit because it was within two weeks of my orginal purchase.

For those hoping to get more camera for less on Black Friday may be left out in the cold. If you need a no-brainer travel camera I can't imagine anything with these features for less money for awhile yet. Update: Now that I've had a few days to play with this I'm keeping my 5 Star rating. I replaced a Nikon S-8000 that I paid double for and sold a month later because of the annoying pop up flash. The DMZ-ZS9 beats the Nikon in every way! The flash is internal. The optical zoom is better, in fact it's as close to an SLR as I've ever seen in a point and shoot. Plus it has the same number of pixels. The Panasonic is also much more user friendly.

My first Panasonic Lumix from nearly six years ago with 5MP surprised me with the quality of its lens and build. This one is my fourth Panasonic/Leica P&S; camera and none of them has let me down. I also have a Panasonic dedicated video camera which takes 1080P (6ofps), so I know the video quality of a good consumer video recorder.Brief testing has shown this to have excellent video at 720P in good light (the video file size is limited to 2GB per scene). If you don't know the lighting requirements to get good video and still images indoors then don't complain about poor video or stills in the dimly-lit rec room. The lens in this camera has nearly an F/4 lens which is not very fast. A decent HD dedicated video camera would have a lens of F/2 or faster (lets in four times as much light). Also, a video camera would have a total image chip size much larger. The image chip on this camera is less than 1/2 inch in size. This is much smaller than a good quality SLR imaging chip. Quality SLRs are capable of higher quality results because they have more costly lenses, frames, electronics, and imaging chips. For all the previous reviewers who complained that this one hundred and thirty dollar camera was not giving them the results they \"expected\" I have a word for you: #FAIL!All point and shoot cameras have imaging chips which are about half an inch in size like this one has. And, considering, they take remarkably good photos within their limitations. Unless you are a professional photographer, you might never need any more quality than a good P&S; camera provides. It takes very good stills with long telephoto possible. At this point I should tell you about the button to the right of the shutter/zoom button - it is a dedicated button which caused the zoom to cycle through three ranges with no intermediate stops: 1) zoom to end of optical range, 2) zoom to end of extended optical range, 3) zoom to end of the digital zoom range. Talk about not wasting time if you have some serious rush to zoom way out! And the focus is fast but, of course, you should not just jam the shutter down, but rather press it halfway to focus, then press it the rest of the way to take the picture. Press the shutter at the end of a power zoom to focus better if necessary. It is fast!One thing that I think is extraordinary is that the fastest shutter speed is 1/4000 of a second. I have never heard of an inexpensive P&S; camera with a speed of more than 1/1000 or at most 1/2000 sec shutter speed. Such a high shutter speed being available allows some specialised photography that formerly only an SLR could do. In the menus many selections are available to customise photos and video settings.The camera requires a Panasonic-approved battery so no cheap knock-offs can be used with this. An important and unusual feature in a camera in this price range is that you can use the camera in a fixed setting, eg studio, using a Panasonic DC coupler (which fits into the battery compartment) and a Panasonic AC adapter which plugs into the DC coupler through a little hatch in the bottom of the camera. These are both extra cost Panasonic accessories which give a professional ability to do unlimited shooting without worrying about running out of battery power. Just think! you could run your own photographic studio using such a setup and this little, yet very capable, camera.It arrives with a CD containing a very thorough PDF about the camera. Don't skip this because it is much more valuable than the PDF you can download on the Panasonic website which shows relatively basic information but not the all important details. Another bit of software on the installation CD (which one does not need to use because Windows 7 or Apple OS will handle importing and sorting photos) is Photo Fun 6.0 which, in my opinion might only be worthwhile for stitching photos into a panorama or doing simple edits on video. Google's Picassa photo software, Flickr editing software, Windows Live Photo software, YouTube video editing online, and Apple's iPhoto will likely do as good a job or likely a better job at organising and processing your photos and video.Ergonomics are quite good and it holds and handles well. Feels well-made but heavy (you want that - plastic is light but not as durable, for example) with metal construction. This is a camera you can be proud of. And it may just last long enough to pass down to your children someday, unlike many low priced cameras which fail within a few years. I suggest installing the wrist strap and always use it.

I also purchased an 8GB Class 10 SDHC card by Transcend for $10, along with a cheap but adequate case for $7.95 or so (all through Amazon).  Over the past decade, I've owned several point-n-shoot cameras (including two prior Lumix).  I also own a full-blown Olympus digital SLR with interchangeable lenses.  I must say... this (DMC-ZS9) is the best Lumix yet, and so very affordable!I am now carrying this camera in the glove box of my car, so I can take those pictures I've always wanted to, but didn't have my SLR handy.  The camera has enough automation to make picture taking quick and painless, while still allowing full manual override for those times when I want to compose something special (without needing my SLR!).The anti-shake works well, especially when using the telephoto mode to capture far away shots.  In fact, the zoom is amazing on this little wonder... and while I don't care much for digital zoom (or the inherent artifacts), the true optical zoom is great... and the digital boost is very handy when I need incredible close-ups of distant objects.The intelligent auto-everything mode works really well, even in outdoor conditions.  The quick keys help me turn the flash completely off when I want to, without having to dig through the main menu system to do so.  This camera, on a tripod, can take amazing low-light shots indoors.  With flash, shots are flat and faces shiny (due to the oils in a face that hasn't been prepped by a makeup artist) - as expected. Turn off that flash, set the self timer, and take a picture that way - incredible!As expected, low light level performance is dismal (the aperture is pretty small - after all, this is a compact camera with lots of zoom).  But, with some natural bounce light from windows and room lighting, some incredible pictures can be had by turning the flash off and using the auto-timer to avoid shaking the camera when pressing the shutter button.  Buy a cheap tripod (or monopod if you don't plan on being in the pictures)... it's be well worth it.Battery life on this camera is excellent... several hundred pictures, and by not using flash, you extend its life even further.  An 8GB SDHC card can hold approximately 1,400 pictures or so... easily a week's vacation, unless you simply don't know how to frame and take pictures correctly.  Oh, speaking of that, this camera even features the classic auto-bracketing; when activated, it will take three pictures for every one click of the button, the first a little under-exposed, the next \"normal\" and the last over-exposed... so you can choose from the best of the three when dealing with tricky lighting conditions.Another thing I really like about this camera is the auto-focus... unlike previous compact cameras, it's FAST... even the \"boot up\" time is fast - you can turn the camera on and be shooting in under two seconds.  That used to be the bane of my existence - having to wait 6 to 10 seconds for my prior Lumix to boot, and several seconds for it to auto-focus.  Well, this one isn't like that - this one is a joy to own and operate!I've taken indoor pictures, as well as pictures of my snowshoeing trip.  All have been excellent (turned flash off for indoor pics), and color rendition has been quite good.  Of course, I use Picasa to adjust and fine-tune the fruits of my efforts prior to displaying them.  I'm considering selling my SLR, and just living with the ZS9... as there's simply no point in my owning an SLR anymore.

The long battery life means that I don't have to buy a couple of spares. Also, the charger is easy to use - pop the batttery in the charger and plug it directly into an outlet - no additional cord necessary. I would definitely recommend this camera, and might even pick up another one as a spare.", "Date": "May 24, 2012"}, {"Title": "Panasonic DMC ZS9", "Author": "R.

Our professional tour guide owned it, along with a larger \"bridge\" superzoom Panasonic camera. He took some fabulous photographs with those cameras. When I got home, I bought a Panasonic Lumix DMC-TZ3, which at the time had the widest lens of any consumer point and shoot digicam on the market. I really liked that camera, although I quickly learned one quirk of all these small Lumix cameras: the lens cover/mechanism is the most fragile part.Some P&S; cams can be dropped into a purse or bag without any case or cover, and do fine. Don't try it with one of these; I did, and broke the lens cover and therefore the entire mechanism that extends the lens when the camera is powered on, and retracts it fully when powered off. I was able to replace the TZ3, and by keeping it in a case when not in use, never had another lens problem.  A few years after the TZ3, I got more zoom, and more features, with the Panasonic Lumix DMC-ZS1. I took that camera almost everywhere I went, and was never disappointed with the pictures I took with it (save for some cases of operator error, not the camera's fault).  As with the TZ3, I've always kept the ZS1 in a case when it's not in use, and have never had a problem with the lens mechanism. A year or two ago I was tempted by a deep Costco discount to try the then-brand-new ZS10, which had a CMOS sensor and 16x optical zoom, plus a few other new bells and whistles. I ended up returning it because I didn't think its pictures were as good as the ones I was getting with my older ZS1 (with its CCD sensor).Last December I found this camera, the ZS9, on amazon at a terrific low price. I read reviews carefully and bought it, because it has a much longer zoom than my trusty old ZS1, but the same kind (CCD) of sensor that I've been happy with. I have not been disappointed with this upgrade to my trusty old ZS1, and have really enjoyed the increased zoom capability along with the good old standby wide-angle lens.", "Date": "July 8, 2012"}, {"Title": "Best Point&Shoot; out there.", "Author": "Gary K", "ReviewID": "R3SA8HME0G9NJ3", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I've read some of the other reviews here and I cannot imagine anyone not being happy with the performance of this camera.  Any negative feedback must be from people who got the very odd bad one, or they simply don't know how to take a picture.  This has amazing low light performance, even at distance.  Pictures from inside the Vatican on a recent trip are amazing. I see more detail in the pics than I remember seeing in person (though it helps that the camera is plugged into our 55\" tv).  I'm not a fan of the flash, but it's rare that I find a situation that I need it, low light photos are that good.  If you're going to use ALL the zoom, you will need to steady the camera mechanically as most people cannot hold the camera that still, even with the stabilization feature, but that's only needed when maxing out the zoom and not for any other shots.  Just learn to use the features by reading the manual and you can't go wrong with the ZS9.  However, if you just want to point & shoot using 'intelligent auto', like my wife, then that works great, too.

Two examples are the Canon S100 and Lumix ZS10 -- both newer P&S; models with CMOS sensors, they have been subject of many complaints re poor image quality i.e. smeary, smudgy not crisp.Last year I bought a CMOS point and shoot camera -- a Canon Elph 300. The image quality was wretched both indoors and out, considerably worse than any CCD point and shoot I'd used before (Nikon and Canon). I started hunting for a CCD camera and settled on this gem, the Panasonic Lumix ZS9.I'm delighted with the ZS9 image quality. Vibrant, bright, realistic ... or if you like a little saturation, the Vivid and Warm modes and a white balance adjustment delivers in spades. In due time I'll acquire a micro 4/3 camera for (near) DSLR-caliber image quality, but for a P&S; camera the ZS9 is superb -- with 16x zoom that you won't find on a micro 4/3 without a ginormous lens.Also love the 24mm wide angle lens -- expands the field of vision beautifully. The camera is solid and well designed and the battery life is shockingly good. I bought mine for $114 \"used\" via Amazon Warehouse Deals and it was in mint shape, just like new -- fantastic value.My only complaint (more of an observation) is that on certain indoor shots, the lower left corner can be slightly darkened. Others have noted this phenomenon as well. To me it doesn't matter ... solved easily enough with a crop if needed.Final note: The only difference between this ZS9 and the ZS8 is that the ZS9 has a stereo microphone, the ZS8 has mono. If this ZS9 is sold out and you want this camera, check out the ZS8.[UPDATE: After three months and hundreds of photos, the ZS9 continues to wow me. The image quality is awesome for a point and shoot. Friends on Facebook ask me what camera I use, the photos get lots of compliments. The clarity and vividity is superb for a P&S; and the zoom is fantastic. Again, if the ZS9 is now longer available, check out the ZS8 with the same CCD sensor, missing only a stereo microphone).]", "Date": "March 16, 2012"}, {"Title": "Excellent Camera", "Author": "M.

The Zs8/9 is 14 MP versus 12 MP for the Zs7. The Zs8/9 has a long 16x optical zoom versus 12x optical zoom for the Zs7. Both cameras are the same size. The Zs3 is also a 12X zoom and is a little smaller than the Z7 or 8/9. Both earlier Z's are a little heavier than the Z8/9. The Z8/9 is more user friendly than the previous models in that it explains through the LCD screen the difference between the various settings one can choose. The Zs8/9 has a sweet 24mm wide lens, which is wider than the 25mm wide lens on the Zs3 and Zs7.So what makes the Zs8/9 such a great value considering it doesn't have GPS,AVCHD video mode, and HDMI out, all of which come with the Zs7? Because I find the picture quality is just as good and possibly better. Maybe it's because of the newer Venus engine. The Zs8/9 has an upgraded Venus VI processing engine compared to the Venus II on the Zs7. Both cameras come with the same outstanding Leica lens and both have a 1/2.33 inch CCD sensor, which creates sharper pictures than the 1/2.33 inch CMOS sensor on the more expensive Zs10.The one area where the Zs7 shines compared to the Zs8/9 is the LCD screen with 460,000 dots versus 230,000 dots. Though I like the sharper LCD screen on the Zs7, I find the 230,000 dot Zs8/9 screen is more than adequate. I can also use the spare aftermarket battery I bought for my Zs7 with the Zs9. The relatively inexpensive aftermarket batteries available for this camera are actually longer lasting than the Panasonic battery that comes with it.The Zs8 and Zs9 differ only in that the Zs9 has a stereo microphone and the Zs8 is just monaural, otherwise the two cameras are the same. In summary, I don't care about GPS (a battery drain) or the ACVHD video format which came on the Zs7 and come on the Zs10 at a much higher price. If you've never owned a Panasonic Zs camera, you don't know how really good they are. The HD video quality on this camera is also amazing.I bought my Zs7 on Amazon for around $300, the going price at the time. Don't be afraid to order your Zs9 \"Used\" from Amazon Warehouse.

Focus and shutter response are pretty quick.  Strong feature set, esp. the 16x optical zoom, Leica lens (hopefully better than average), and good image stabilization inside a compact/pocket-size package.  But none of that matters since the image quality is very poor, displaying heavy noise (random-colored grain) when viewed at 100%.  I understand this is a compact camera and not a professional camera, but none of my other digital cameras (most consumer-grade) are this bad.  On the consumer cameras, I always shoot images at best Jpeg quality (least compression) and max resolution (or raw if it is available for certain situations).  So the image quality should not be due to higher compression.  Even in full daylight, or full fluorescent light (incl. w/ flash), or full incandescent (incl. w/ flash), and forcing the camera to ISO 100, it is still pretty bad, particularly in and around any kind of shadow and solid darker colors.  If you look at any kind of detail, the noise jumps out at you.  Panasonic engineers/designers/marketers should be ashamed for accepting this awful substandard image quality.I also have an older Panasonic DMC-FZ18 (18x optical zoom, image stabilization, and not compact) I gave to my spouse and it produces better quality images that are of acceptable quality (but far short of a good professional camera).  The DMC-FZ18's image quality suffers in high-ISO, low-light situations, to where it is intolerable but still a little better than this DMC-ZS9.I called Panasonic customer service and the rep I talked to seemed very knowledgeable on the Panasonic camera line and on advanced photography fundamentals.  He started to walk me through very basic troubleshooting steps, which I had already performed so I explained I have two decades of photography experience, we talked about photography fundamentals until he was convinced I knew what I was talking about.  We then skipped right to the settings I had set on the camera until he finally told me I need to send the camera in to their McAllen, TX, service center (with a note attached giving my case number and explaining my issue).  I sent the camera in and Panasonic turned it around pretty fast and got it back to me in just over two weeks (they also called me to notify me they received it and a technician was working on it), BUT they found no issues with the camera and declared it \"CHECKED OK\".  So Panasonic manufactured a very poor quality camera and refuses to acknowledge the image quality issue.The firmware and/or the CCD is garbage, which makes the camera itself pretty worthless.  Panasonic refuses to acknowledge the image quality issue and claims the camera is fine.

The Canon took nice pictures, but did not have HD video recording and only a 3x optical zoom. The Fujifilm had nice video quality but the audio quality was lacking and taking pictures in low light setting while indoors proved very difficult. Going from the Fujifilm camera to this one, I can say that I am very very pleased with how the Panasonic takes pictures.PROS:-I've taken lots of pictures indoors while owning this camera, and I'm very pleased with how the Intelligent Auto setting captures the room- pictures turn out clear with little noise, even with only a lamp as a light source.-Pictures in lower-light settings are much better than I expected for a point and shoot of this price.-The zoom capability is very good- much better than lots of other point and shoot cameras.-The different scene modes are easy to find and there is a good number of scenes from which to choose (some of the more interesting setting include Soft Skin, Transform, Food, Party, Candlelight, Beach, and Snow, among others).-The flash has worked very well for me, even though it's not necessary in lots of settings.-The amount of time it takes to focus and take a picture is short.CONS: A bit thicker than most point and shoots, some noise with zoomed-in shots indoors, not the best Panorama setting I've seen. (However, I wouldn't recommend starting a search for another camera because of these things).Sadly I can't comment on the battery power as I haven't used it to its full potential but I did buy a backup just in case.

I've been playing around with it for a few months now and most of my photos are just not very good. I read the whole manual and really tried to make the pictures look good because there are obviously many others who have had good luck with it based on reviews. I am not a camera expert and mostly use the iA mode indoors. Here are the problems I'm having (feel free to comment and let me know if I'm doing something wrong or if there's a way to correct any of these issues):1. If my kids move AT ALL they become a see-through very blurry object. I'll upload a photo later as an example. But this is my #1 concern since my kids move their head, arms, legs or SOMETHING in almost every photo I take. I tried to take pictures of them on their new swingset and trampoline, but they were unrecognizably blurry. If my toddler moves her arm up when I take a picture, her arm is a see through blurry blob while the rest of the photo looks good. I know there are a bunch of settings I can learn about that might help each situation, but since my kids are doing different things in different directions, I can't keep changing settings and shutter speeds hoping to take a good action shot. I thought iA would do this automatically. PLEASE let me know how I can fix this before the camera meets the trash bin. My 6-year-old Canon A640 never had this issue. It could focus on the subject and take a good non-blurry photo even if they moved, which I would expect this camera to do based of the rave reviews.2. My indoor photos are grainy and blurry. I hold the camera steady, but they are so blurry that I'm embarrassed to have to use them on my blog and elsewhere. Again, this is using iA. If I have to crop the photo at all I'm in trouble. I find myself apologizing a lot for my poor quality photos. I've made sure all the settings are set at optimum photo and video quality. I'm sure I could mess around with the many settings and find one that produces a better photo, but I was hoping for an easy point & shoot since I'm not good at photography.3. The corners, especially the lower left corner, are dark in many of my indoor photos. In reading other reviews, I see this same issue addressed and it seems to be a flaw with this design. I have to zoom a little or turn off the flash to avoid the darkened corner, which is disappointing.My last issue is no fault of this camera. The videos are uploaded as .MOV as opposed to .AVI like my Canon. This is not supported by my photo editing software I use daily. Big bummer! The movies download fine, but cannot be played unless I open a different program, so I need to figure that one out.I am very disappointed because I love the look and feel of this camera. It seems to be very sturdy and should last a long time. The zoom is great and video quality seems to be good so far. The battery lasts for a long time and recharges in only 2 hours. I really wish it took better quality photos, especially since I'm past the time I can return it!

Here is my take.Pros:- Incredible Price- Battery life is excellent even with flash and constantly using zoom- Decent flash at this price point- Incredible ZoomCons:- Poor picture quality- Poor video quality- I find it a little bulky and I wish it was smaller, but I realize this is a trade-off for the zoomAs others have said, if you have plenty of outside light then the pictures are good, but almost any digicam can do that.  Where digicams are tasked is when there is a need for the flash or how the electronics might predict the need for an ISO change.  It simply doesn't do a very good job of this.  Some pictures are way overexposed and some are underexposed.  Also, I find the HD video quality really lacking and very soft.As I mentioned above, at this price point you really can't go too wrong, but I was expecting more.____________________________________________****UPDATE****I've gotten to spend much more time with this camera and have increased the rating.  Before I mention why let me say that I too am experiencing what others have noticed where a shadow appears on the very corner of some images.

What I'm finding is that I hardly have any shots that I miss.  With my previous digicam I would see some pics afterwards had poor lighting or came out blurred.  With this camera it gets it.  It is rare that I see some images that really WOW me because I still thing the overall quality could be improved, but still I do have to give credit where credit is due and in this case it does a great job of capturing the moment albeit with not perfect clarity.The rest of what I reflected above in the review still stands.", "Date": "March 9, 2012"}, {"Title": "Great camera!", "Author": "dalex", "ReviewID": "R3PL5ZSGR8FYH4", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I got my DMC-ZS9 2 weeks ago and I'm thoroughly pleased with it.

The ZS9 tries so often to use no higher than ISO400 indoors, and to do that it has to slow the shutter down to 1/15 or 1/8...But the results themselves are then pretty good.Because I have used a digital camera since 2001, I did not expect the ZS9 to be an indoor king. For that, I recommend the Canon S-110, which I almost bought for a lot more money, except that I really loved the smooth zoom of the ZS9...Once you use the ZS9 zoom outdoors, you dont want to let it go.B./ What is really fun for the price is that the ZS9 has a GREAT set of full manual(PASM)functions. After 2 months experience, it is my personal favorite way to shoot with this camera, indoors especially,  Set the shutter at 1/30 and leave it. Then it is quite easy to adjust aperture (you need to be in A mode) til the exposure bar is where you want it, then shoot. Very satisfying for stills and portraits, as well as most pet and kid shots. A few tries in a few different lighting conditions, and you are well on your way to photographic fun, instead of just picture-taking.Video is on a near par and above some brands. In normal room lighting, to me the ZS9 has better color, esp. on Automatic white balance.  Outdoors, the video is super !CONCLUSION:I'm keeping my ZS9 till something better for the price comes along, and that may take quite a while.

This camera, small, extremely portable, quick to use is the sort of camera Henri Cartier Bresson would use were he still alive and active. What first attracted me to this camera (Panasonic DMC-ZS9) was the Leica Vario-Elmar lens. I'd used the SLR version of this lens for years. I was surprised to see it on this sort of camera. Then I realized that this Panasonic camera was virtually identical to one of Leica's digital cameras. The main difference was in the price. The Leica was more than twice as much, not surprising, Leicas have always cost much more than most cameras. But they usually were unique. This time, it is quite obvious that Panasonic is making the camera for Leica and using one of their famous lens designs.The camera is a joy to use. The controls are handy and thorough. My sole complaint is the lack of a viewfinder. That is due to my age and old habits. I like looking at my subject through a viewfinder.

Like many others, I read tons of reviews before deciding on this camera. I was so excited when it arrived and loved the looks and feel of it. Unfortunately, I noticed immediately that almost all my indoor pictures have a dark corner on the lower left side. Wondering if it was an LCD issue, I downloaded the images and the dark corner was still there.So, my question for those who have this same model is ARE YOU HAVING THE SAME PROBLEM? Does this camera produce a dark corner indoors or in low light? The dark corner is gradual, meaning the picture fades into the darker area in the very corner, almost like my finger was in the way slightly, providing a slight shadow. We thought it was normal at first until we realized that many of the photos ONLY had this dark corner in the lower left area and none of the other corners were effected. Also, it is not an issue when I zoom in or turn the flash off. But I do see the dark corner in many of my indoor photos using the different camera settings, with the flash on, not zooming in at all. Some photos you can barely see the dark corner and other photos it's pretty noticeable.UPDATE 1/24/12:I've uploaded 4 photos to Amazon on the main product page of this camera. They all have notes added to them to help you distinguish them from some of the other uploaded pictures from other customers. There's a picture of a chef plate, our entryway, our living room carpet, and my old camera. Let me know if you think it's a normal low-light dark shadow or not. My pictures turn out fine outside and in brighter light. Hmmmm...UPDATE 2/2/12:Those who have commented on my review have been very helpful (and have noticed this same problem with their ZS9 cameras). It turns out that Panasonic is aware of this dark shadow in the lower left corner and mentioned it on pg 41 of the downloadable manual (thanks J. Conner!). It seems to be in low light settings when the flash is turned on and you don't zoom in at all. This just happened to be how I took the first several photos when I received the camera which is why I noticed it right away. I have changed my rating from 2 stars and given the camera 4 stars. I use the camera in my home a lot to take pictures of various items, so I will just have to zoom a little or turn the flash off to avoid the dark corner. Not a deal breaker, but worthy of losing 1 star since I use these particular settings enough.Love everything else so far! The sturdy feel of the camera, crisp photos, excellent videos (and the fact that you CAN zoom while videoing is wonderful and was one of my requirements for my next digital camera). The battery compartment is sturdy and built to last. The camera I'm replacing had a cheap PLASTIC battery door with plastic components inside that broke and had to be replaced numerous times.

The Nikon appears to have quality issues on the zoom lens causing lockups. Otherwise it was my personal favorite. The DMC-ZS10 has a new CMOS sensor that, probably in combination with the camera software, seems to produce noisy photos. The DMC-ZS8 pictures with its CCD imager are reported to be better.Then I found the built-for-Amazon DMC-ZS9. It is basically a DMC-ZS8 with stereo mics as near as I can tell. At any rate it is a fantastic little camera for the (currently) $129 price tag. Picture quality is quite nice. Program Mode does better than iAuto, especially for indoor flash pictures.

The camera is \"TOO NEW\" and they don't know what to do with it. They don't know what is wrong with it because it is \"TOO NEW\".  They can't send me a replacement camera because it is \"TOO NEW\".

However the techie in me wants the pocket camera to be capable of some pretty good photography if its all I have when one of those moments happens. There are only a few brands of cameras out there that have a line of cameras that fit the bill for this.These Lumix cameras are some pretty serious \"point and shoot\" cameras, capable of producing some publishable and/or sellable  photos, if you're among those who know what it means to take it to the limits. My first ever digital camera was an early point and shoot Coolpix, just a 1 megapixel camera, but even with that I took a few shots that ended up published and earned me $50 checks. This camera? No doubt it can do the same, and with 14 megapixles no doubt it can do considerably more too.Take control of the camera. Pretty much everything your SLR can do, this camera can also do, although yes there are limitations. But limitations are also challenges that can be overcome. Sure they aren't as fast, the sensor is smaller, and so much more that could be said against a camera like this one, but it comes down to my SLR with power pack, a 300mm lens, or even an 80-200 zoom, thats not all going to fit in a shirt pocket. If I could change one thing about this camera, it would be that I'd include a way to use a few basic filters on it. The lens, by the way, is simply amazing. At full 16X zoom, its not Leica sharp like what you're thinking, but did you really expect it to be? For the price? Its still plenty good though, and no doubt a tripod and timer would improve this. I haven't had the time to try it yet, but I will soon enough.The macro capability is stunning, this alone is worth the $129 price.The video looks great. It looks better than some of the stuff I've seen made with digital, high definition camcorders. No kidding.This camera gets a \"wow!\" rating from me.

It's first use was at a wedding to capture important moments with the expectation that I could edit the file by cropping out what was not important and get closer to the subject of interest.  What a disappointment, the picture quality was very poor, moving objects were blurred \"bride walking down the aisle\" poor depth of field, grainy spotty pictures, need I go on.I decided to compare the two cameras with the expectation that my old 9MP would show lower detail and poorer light levels.  My old DMC-TZ5 out preformed the new DMC-ZS9 in all areas except the power of the zoom.  That includes video quality, focus, and sound.  What happened? Panasonic has been offering clear quality upgrades over the years; how do you go from a 9MP to a 14MP and get clearly poorer results?  I suggest you shop around and look online for product reviews comparing this one to other cameras at a similar cost.  Although if you are just looking for a point and shoot, and only expect to print out 4x6 photos and shoot mainly outside, the zoom is incredible and this camera may be the one for you.

I read the mostly positive reviews and didn't pay much heed to those who complained that it didn't perform well in the dark.First, the Pros:The camera has a solid feel to it and the  body contains  enough metal  to reassure you that it is going to last for some time.  The controls are intuitive and the attention to detail is good down to the way the battery cover springs open and the latching mechanism within the battery compartment feels secure. The zoom lens operates fairly quietly, more so than the Canon and image quality is good.  I was able to take some photos in shutter priority mode of a circus act from 100 feet away with very good results in imperfect lighting conditions (night) so the zoom and exposure control capabilities are quite impressive. Battery life is also quite good.Now the consI was attempting to take some pictures of my wife at a night event. This was something that the old Canon handled flawlessly in the past without any difficulty. It took great night photos even when lighting was poor and approaching complete darkness; the illuminator would  provide sufficient light to frame the subject properly. After boasting to my wife about how wise my choice of new camera had been I was utterly embarrassed that I couldn't even see her in the LCD display. Many of the shots had to be taken by guesswork which was totally frustrating and the results were even more disappointing because I simply could not zoom in or out properly to frame the shot. The majority of the photos missed most of her body and others were not centred or zoomed in too much or too little.I will be checking to see if one of the camera's modes allows for better night time illumination, but it shouldn't have to be so difficult to find if it is there at all.Bottom LineGreat camera for good lighting conditions but forget it if you want to do portraits in darkness. Panasonic's engineers should try out some Canon cameras for night time performance to see what the competition is offering. Because of this flaw I will have to look for another camera with good overall performance. You can rest assured that it won't be a Panasonic this time.", "Date": "February 8, 2012"}, {"Title": "Unsuitable for indoor shooting", "Author": "pictureman \"pictureman\"", "ReviewID": "R39QEO4RUD11U3", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "This camera has worse resolution than lesser cameras I have owned.Many images are very blurry in what should have been a adequate indoor lighting with the cameras flashTotally dissatisfied with camera as a point and shoot", "Date": "May 22, 2012"}, {"Title": "A very good Camera.", "Author": "Evans Nwaomah \"eso-evans\"", "ReviewID": "R1M4JE94P4T2XH", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This is an excellent Camera.

Perhaps, the contour of the case, espcially at the right side, needs to be re-designed to make it easier to be held by hand.  (b) the auto focus is not sensitive when the camera is at its high power zoom (say 12X - 15X).

This model was produced exclusively for Amazon sales and the asking price seemed too good to be true--it was!This model is very much like my Lumix ZS5 except with a longer zoom and stereo microphone. It's virtually identical to the ZS8 but for the latter's monaural microphone. NONE of these cameras comes with Panasonics AVCHD (lite) video compression. They come with Quick Time (QT) video compression instead. Reportedly the ZS7 came with AVCHD as did the ZS3. This has some profound downsides as I'll explain below. I also noticed the ZS5 though with a shorter zoom, had a larger diameter lense. Maybe it's the optical physics kicking up a fuss but my understanding is a larger lens is likely to have more light gathering capability.All of these models are limited to creating file sizes of 2GB or less. So is my Sony video recorder. The difference is the Sony doesn't simply STOP when it reaches the 2GB limit, it proceeds to create a successor 2GB file and keeps filming. The Panasonic, at least the ZS5, ZS8, & ZS9 do not. They stop dead in their tracks. To make matters worse, the QT jpeg format, though widely understood and compatible, is a poor video compression scheme consisting of essentially a stack of jpeg photos per second. The AVCHD compression algorithm developed in tandem with Sony pays off by squeezing more information into that 2GB file. PLUS, you'll recall, the Panasonic stops dead in its tracks when it reaches the 2GB limit rather than continuing with a subsequent 2GB file. The Sony does this without a hiccup. I'm not certain whether the Lumix models that *do* include the AVCHD standard will continue to tape provided storage room remains or not. Now for the biggest piece of bad news--without a more efficient compression algorithm storing information in that 2GB file, your maximum film length with the ZS5, the ZS8, & the ZS9 will be around 8 minutes--period! You'll have to be physically present to depress the start/shutter button again to continue shooting. This does little for continuity in public events like, say a speaker or a lecture. Perhaps this camera is better suited for 'B' roll than providing a continuous flow.What's sad is all of the 2GB file limit DEAD STOP and the AVCHD could be resolved with a firmware upgrade...fat chance. Panasonic's got your money so now you can crawl into a hole AND DIE so far as the company is concerned. This arrangement was so thoughtless in avoiding attention to detail and ergonomics.On the up side, the camera is highly portable, produces reasonably respectable IQ for its size, has CCD technology better implemented than Panasonic's ZS10 CMOS camera. There are plenty of fun features including a plethora of scene modes, a menu system that's easy enough to learn but a weak internal flash. To its credit, the autofocus works well in video mode and the IA (intelligent) mode is reasonably effective. There are also a host of manual options which makes the unit attractive to a wide spectrum of consumers. For travel and taking snaps, it's ideal...and it won't bankrupt you.Somebody needs to jail break this camera by hacking the firmware to provide AVCHD and sequential 2GB file creation. 8 minutes just ain't long enough--even for porn producers. Didn't the Rodney King beating last longer than that?
