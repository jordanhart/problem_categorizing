The original camera experienced bouts of rain, snow, freezing temperatures, dust, wind and excessive heat (100 degrees plus) for long periods of time, yet it continued to work for nearly 18 months.

The \"intelligent auto mode\" automatically detects 4 different types of scenes is great when shooting action pic's of my dogs as they play.This also has an audio function with an off/on mode.Mine came with 4MB SD memory card and a free AA battery Charger and two rechargeable AA batteries. From Stonewall Camera.Only drawback is it does not have a viewfinder; but fewer and fewer Point & Shoot cameras at this price have one.For this price break it would be hard to find a better 10MP camera", "Date": "January 25, 2014"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": "$73.00", "Features": null, "Name": "Olympus T10 Silver 10MP Digital Camera", "ImgURL": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51JoF7ZHpnL._SX300_.jpg", "ProductID": "B004L3KJ3K"}}
