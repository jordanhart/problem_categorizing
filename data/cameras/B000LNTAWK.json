{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Nikon has nailed it", "Author": "Kevin Mackie", "ReviewID": "R2VR22K818FYWC", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "No matter how you slice it, this is a great camera.If you're considering this camera you likely to be in one of two camps:  A Nikon person trying to determine whether or not to buy the N50, N70 or the D200; or you already know you want something more on the pro end of the pro-amateur spectrum and are trying to choose between a Nikon and a Canon.  If you're in the latter camp then you can't go wrong with either the D200 or any of Canon's offerings.  They both make excellent cameras.  If you're already a Nikon person, get the Nikon; if you're already a Canon person, get the Canon.That said, I'm a Nikon person, and after 5 years of having fun with my film-based N80 I wanted to make the leap into real digital photography.  I say real, because I've had a Canon Sureshot for 4 years and it's great for snapshots, but when it comes to landscapes or dealing with any kind of lighting issues, it just doesn't measure up.  Since I'm a Nikon person (all my lenses work with the new digital SLRs) I looked at the N50, N70 and D200.  There are plenty of sites out there that compare these three cameras (against each other and the competition) to death, so I won't bother with all the details.We buy cameras to take a variety of different pictures and my choice was driven by my needs, so my review is going to be colored by the kinds of pictures I tend to take.  My favorite pastime is landscape photography.  For this, any of the three cameras will take great pictures.  The 6 mega pixels on the N50 and N70 are more than enough to take great pictures - I've got a 20x30 poster of Yosemite's Half Dome taken with a friend's N70 that is as crisp as anything I've seen.  Having 10mps gives me more room to play with when it comes time for cropping, though, and that's always nice, but hardly a reason to shell out an extra grand.My next favorite photography subject is my yellow lab, Happy.  If he's standing or sitting still, then all three of these cameras take excellent portrait shots.  But when he's moving, such as launching himself off the end of a pier to fetch a toy in the lake, the D200 really shines.  Its 5fps burst mode takes perfect pictures.  It focuses each shot and with its rich 25 picture buffer built into the camera, I've yet to fill it up.  What this means is that it doesn't matter what speed your memory card is.  The camera takes its pictures and puts them into its buffer.  Then a separate set of processors moves the picture from the buffer to your memory card.  I would have to hold the button down for over 8 seconds before the burst mode would slow down (it would simply slow down to the speed of your memory card here - it wouldn't stop taking pictures).  This clarity of the pictures in burst mode is what made me choose the D200, and with the 18-70mm DX kit lens you'll get some brilliant photos.While all three cameras let you take great picture, the D200 makes it very easy to change the most often used settings.  Picture quality (e.g. resolution and depth), White Balance and ISO can be changed by holding down a single button with your left hand and rotating the command dials with your right.  This means you don't have to take your eyes off of what you're looking at through the viewfinder in order to change these settings, and I find myself changing at least one of these on almost every picture I take.  To be sure, you can change them on the N50 and N70 as well, but just not as quickly or easily.Other things I liked about the D200 are:  o  Build.  It's made of metal and has a very nice heft to it.  The D50 and D70, much like my N80, are made of a very good plastic, and I've never had any problems with the N80, but the D200 just feels good  o  LCD.  The 2.5 inch LCD makes it easy to determine whether or not you're happy with a picture in the field.  o  Color.  The auto white balance for the D200 is awesome and the colors are brilliant.  o  4 settings banks.  You can preprogram four settings (ISO, WB, Picture Quality, etc) so you can get to it quickly.One last point - the D200 is very difficult to get a hold of these days, but it's slightly easier to get in kit form (which comes with a lens).  The 18-55mm lens is nice, but I prefer the 18-70mm (remember, with digitals you have to multiply the focal length by 1.5 to compare it with their film counterparts, so the 18-70 for digital is more like a 28-105 for film).  The 18-70mm kit will run you about $300 more than the body itself, and it's worth it.If you don't already have a big zoom lens then the new 18-200mm Nikon VR lens is awesome (equivalent to 28-300 for film).  It takes stunning pictures and has all the zoom you're likely to need.  It runs between $700 and $800 and is even harder to get than the D200 (which is why I don't have one yet :-).In summary, you can't go wrong with any of these Nikons.  The D200, however, is definitely the king of the hill.  Happy picture takine!", "Date": "February 24, 2006"}, {"Title": "Credible digital for the serious amateur", "Author": "W. Kurtz \"B. Kilgore\"", "ReviewID": "R3MG7151VIPRUT", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I just had the opportunity to use 2 nikon D200 cameras on a trip to Antarctica. All I can say is \"wow\"! I have been hesitant to make the move to digital due to the relatively low resolutions of the early amateur digital SLRs. The specs for the D200 caught my eye. Of particular interest were the 10.2 MP resolution, the magnesium body and the enhanced environmental sealing. In fairly adverse conditions the cameras performed flawlessly. Particularly notable were their ability to work in cold conditions, something I was concerned about at the beginning of the trip. While other people's cameras were having battery issues in the cold, the D200 kept shoothing. The camera handles very well and is easy to shoot with. There is a bit of a learning curve to understand all the custom settings and menus. The good news is that most of the controls build off of familiar Nikon concepts so they are not hard to pick up. The output of the camera is amazing and while I have not had the chance to review my shots on anything but a laptop, the early returns are very positive. The new autofocus system is quite good, though one of my few complaints is that it sometimes seemed balky with certain subjects. I am willing to write this off as perhaps my not have a full understanding of the various focusing modes, but time will tell. The monitor on the camera is really good and viewable in bright light. Being able to shoot at 5 fps was nice when trying to shoot diving humpback whales. In this case the DX size sensor comes in handy, extending effective focal length by 1.5 the 35mm equivalent. With wide angle the DX is a little more frustating and I see a new lens in my future. I am very happy with the D200. I think Nikon is feeling some heat from Canon and had to come up with an offering that upped the ante on the price performance curve. The D200 looks like they got a lot of it right.", "Date": "January 10, 2006"}, {"Title": "Professional Camera at a Prosumer Price", "Author": "Online Junkie", "ReviewID": "R3GYO91YVD5POM", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "When the D200 was announced with its feature set and price, I was shocked at the low price. I was on the wait list at several places, but luckily picked up one at BHphotovideo. I've had one or two minor glitches such as the mirror/shutter locked up. A quick call to NikonUSA and tech support told me to reset the menus. I did that and I was back in action in 10 minutes. The images it produces are incredible. I upgraded from my Nikon D70 which is also an excellent camera, but I wanted several features that the D200 has. My AI/AIS manual focus Nikkor lenses can be used on the d200 and exposure metering & Aperture Priority mode are features I really wanted. This makes macro photography a snap with my AIS lenses. Other added features included Mirror Lock Up, 5fps drive, faster read/write on the CF cards, vertical grip, improved focus speed and the list of other improvements is long.Image Quality - This is was photography is all about. The colors jump out at you as they are vibrant. The 10mp images allow for cropping when necessary and you can still print large. The b&w; mode is great. This camera beats the medium format film cameras and I have a Hasselblad and a Rollieflex as well. So when I want higher quality than my d200, I have to grab my 4x5 camera...Shooting raw NEF the files are about 16mb. But shoot compressed raw and the files are only 8-10mb and no one has been able to tell the difference in quality.Cons: Still very hard to find as demand is so high. Need big CF cards, get 2gb or 4gb CF cards as you will not want to stop shooting this gem.Bottom line: The D200 is a pro quality camera body for a consumer price. Wedding photographers have embraced it. There are few photographers who could outgrow it. It's got a ton of features so be sure to read the manual while you're charging up the battery. Unless you shoot high speed action sports, this should be all you need. If you need a faster motor drive, then get the D2x.", "Date": "March 18, 2006"}, {"Title": "Already one of the great ones.  A great deal.", "Author": "Roger J. Buffington", "ReviewID": "RYANXHVG8C7H3", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "The Nikon D200 is a professional camera which is also aimed at the serious amateur digital photographer.  It is essentially the upgrade unit from the D100/D70s, and it incorporates solid improvements over those excellent cameras.The most obvious upgrade feature of the D200 is the 10.2 megapixel images that it creates.  The advantage of more megapixels is twofold.  Firstly, many digital photographers \"crop\" their images in post-processing.  For example, if you take a photograph of a flying bird such that the bird occupies only a quarter of the image, you may want to crop the image such that you eliminate half of the image, leaving the bird dominant.  More megapixels means more detail will survive the cropping, which is essentially a form of magnification.  Secondly, if you wish to print images larger than about 8 x 10, more megapixels again equates to more detail.In my opinion the most impressive improvement in the D200 over the D100/D70s is the autofocus system.  The D200 gives the user numerous different autofocus modes over and above those offered by the D100/D70s.  These are designed to make it easier and more effective for the user to photograph moving and erratic subjects, such as fast-flying birds, or athletes on the playing field for you sports photographers.  This, combined with another big improvement of the D200--the fabulously bright and wide viewfinder--makes it much easier to photograph difficult fast-moving subjects.  The D200 viewfinder is wonderfully bright, making acquisition of difficult subjects much easier.  Combined with the improved autofocus, I am bringing home more \"keeper\" photographs of erratically flying birds in which these photos are in perfect focus.The D200 also offers up to 5 frames-per-second continuous shooting, and has a big buffer so that the camera will not slow down to write to the CF card.  This is really useful when shooting fast-moving subjects.  When combined with the excellent autofocus system, the user can shoot fast shots with confidence that most or all of them will be in focus.  This is another improvement over the 3 FPS of the D70s.Another obvious improvement of the D200 is its body construction.  The quality and durability of the D200, which is housed in an all-metal body which is weathersealed at all critical points, has to be experienced to be appreciated.  The unit is built very solidly, but happily does not sacrifice weight for durability like some Nikons (remember the F5?) have done in the past.  Despite being all-metal, the D200 is light enough that you will probably not mind carrying it all day on vacation (like I like to do) or during outdoor photo shoots.  Although this camera body is of pro-quality, it nevertheless retains enough lightness and is sufficiently compact that amateurs will not feel overwhelmed by its size or weight when carrying it around on vacation or whatnot.Other reviewers have noted that the D200 is much more similar to Nikon's other professional cameras, and I am inclined to agree with this.  I am only an enthusiastic amateur, and I am convinced that the D200 is about as much camera as virtually any amateur can effectively appreciate.The D200 menu system is very good, and it is an improvement over the already very good menus contained in the D100/D70s.  The camera allows the user to set up four \"banks\" of settings that are completely independent of one another.  Thus, you can have one bank with settings optimized for portraits, one for fast-moving subjects (e.g. birds), one for landscapes, and one for point-and-shoot \"party\" shots. (This is how I have mine set up, credit to \"Nikonians\").  While this sounds complicated, the way Nikon set up their menus actually made this quite easy to grasp, and after about thirty minutes of playing with the camera I was quite proficient with the menus.  Good job Nikon.By the way, the exposure system on the D200 is also an upgrade from the D100/D70s.  Nikon really spared no effort to make the D200 a quantum leap over its already excellent line of amateur DSLRs.  This is the first amateur digital camera that I have used that seems to get exposures as good as my old F5 film camera (one of the great Nikons during the film era) although the D100 and D70s came pretty close.With the D200 Nikon continues its tradition of offering a nice on-board flash.  This flash is fine for snapshots and fill-flash of close subjects.  Serious shooters will want either the SB-600 or SB-800 external flash units.  Again, here Nikon has given the camera pro features--the D200 built in flash can act as a \"command\" unit for other flashes.  Serious amateurs and pros will appreciate this feature.As if to prove that it re-engineered the D70s/D100 from the ground up, Nikon also improved the battery situation with the D200.  The D200 battery has built in voltage testing, which means that the battery indicator on the D200 is actually accurate, a first in my experience with any DSLR camera.  This means that when it says that the battery is half-discharged, that is actually the case.  (On other, earlier units, when the battery indicator moved from \"full\" this usually meant full discharge was imminent.)  This is important because the D200 does go through a battery significantly faster than did the D100/D70s.  This is partly because of (yes, another upgrade) the larger LCD viewer on the back of the camera, and partly just to the more complex electronics in the unit.  Serious users will want to buy one or more extra batteries to stash in one's pocket or vest.The 18-70 DX kit lens is a very nice little lens.  It features some ED glass for better contrast in the images.  Since it is a DX lens, it is small and light, while sacrificing nothing in image quality.  This is a great first lens or walkaround vacation lens for portraits, snapshots, and landscape shots.One very minor quibble with the D200.  The default sharpening settings are somewhat soft.  Some users have been unhappy that when they take the D200 out of the box and start shooting, that their images are not tack-sharp, as to be expected from a high-end camera.  Not to worry, simply set sharpening to +1 or higher in the camera and it will produce sharp images.  Better yet, experiment in post-processing with sharpness settings.  Bottom line is that the unit will and does produce tack-sharp images, but not with the default menu settings.Overall, the D200 is a pro camera at amateur pricing.  It is used by pros and serious amateurs, and with its feature set and impeccable quality and ergonomics, it is an impressive offering by Nikon.  This is one of those cameras that is really fun to use, and it produces fine, sharp, and bright images limited only by the skill of the photographer.

The interface is intuitive and really is beyond compare in my experience. Every adjustment is right there at your finger tips making it fast and easy to change settings as different lighting and situations present themselves. This camera fits my hands like a glove!So far the matrix metering is impressive. The amount of detail captured in the shadow area is exceptional!Contrary to rumors I have read the D200 does offer capture in black and white mode.Nikon has done a lot right here!One other thing the software is another excellent feature. You can import existing pictures, regardless of brand camera used to capture. The upload is quick and offers the ability to tag, export, mail, adjust, resize and more.  Very nice and comprehensive user interface there as well.Packaging and accessories are first class!One side note, the battery does not last anywhere near the 1800 captures described in the descriptions I have read. One battery does not get me through a day of shooting, particulary when using a VR lens. Plan on getting a couple of hundred shots in between charging possibly more if using manuall focus and shutting off frequently.Overall I am very happy with the purchase of this camera. It's the best value on the market in my opinion.*Continued assessment after even more extensive use.Ok...I am even more impressed than I was when I wrote the above portion of this review.The amount of well thought out features on this camera expand the photographers capability greatly.Start with having four custom menu's that can be set and ready to use just a click away. For instance, one set-up for sports, one for flash portraiture, one for night capture and so on.This camera produces the best life-like as witnessed at the time of capture color I have expereienced since discovering photography almost 30 years ago.I mean superb color! Pariculary in the greens and blues. Every color really!The images produced have the least amount of digital noise I have seen.  This means better pictures, enlargements and best of all a lot less time spent in the processing.  I even jack the ISO(International Standards Organization) up to 800 or a 1000 with excellent results!  There is some noise at 1600. About the same as some of the other cameras I've used when set at ISO 200.The EV(Exposure Variation) adjustments are easy to access and you can set the increment value to 1/3, 1/2 or 1 full stop depending on personal preference.Oh! You can do picture Overlays in the camera!

L. Miller", "ReviewID": "RCCHWPZH71QNJ", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "Very few people are going to give an accurate review of the new Nikon D200, but I'm going to try. I'm NOT going to review the D200 on its own. That's not realistic or representative of how shoppers will seek out this camera. At such a high price, most buyers will have experience with digital cameras and DSLRs and be matching the D200 against other models. This review examines the new Nikon in that regard. IF you are actually thinking of this as a FIRST DSLR, please STOP. This is most likely not a good 1st DSLR due to it's complexity and steep learning curve. Please consider a D50 or D70s or the Canon 350XT which are also in the hands of plenty of professionals.All others please read on....The Nikon D200 is fairly advanced DSLR which uses interchangeable lenses and works with the Nikon flash system to produce professional results. It has a lighting fast auto focus system, though this is augmented nicely by the additional SB 800 flash which increases AF accuracy even further. For 1699.00 you know this is a serious unit that can take amazing photos, but the real question that MOST people will ask is this:Do I need this level of camera over the D70s or D50 which cost a thousand dollars less? The question can be answered quite simply. If you shoot action, such as sports or birds or any fast moving objects, the D200's speed can serve you well, bringing a higher success rate. For more typical shooting, such as family, portraits and scenic, the advantages are questionable.Don't let the higher mega pixel rate fool you. Prints from these cameras look just about the same. The D200's higher resolution gives you more cropping ability, but the D70 or D50 are more than capable in this area as well. The D200's higher ISO abilities are quite limited and this has been a major disappointment for users who have been honest about it. The Nikon D50 is better in this regard, as is the D2Hs. This is a major stumble at this price point. Some users will claim good ISO, but it's not forgiving in the least.The viewfinder of the D200 may be the single most improved area at this price point. It's both bright and sharp compared to less models. This is not something to be taken lightly. A bright viewfinder is key for proper composition.Handling of the D200 is beyond excellent. Like all of Nikon's DSLRs, the D200 just gets it right in a way than Canon continues to miss. This is yet another reason why people buy Nikon as it seems to be designed by people who actually shoot. The D200 is a work of art in this regard.Picture quality is excellent, but this is NOT a camera for beginners. Higher resolution also means less sharp results without proper hand held technique. The D200 also employs VERY mild in-camera sharpening and this should be done in post. This is the polar opposite of cameras like the D50 or Canon 350 which deliver good shots right out of the camera. The D200 was designed to deliver as RAW a file as possible and allow the photographer final say in the digital darkroom. Because of this the D200 requires a fairly modern and fast computer with Photoshop or some other powerful post software that can handle the large files.So what you're paying for here is a professional camera with superior focusing and shooting speed. Picture quality is about on par with other DSLRs. While some folks will claim otherwise, ALL DSLRs take great pictures in experienced hands and you'd be hard pressed to tell them apart. Pro's and enthusiasts buy more for handling than anything else. In that capacity the D200 does not disappoint.Current Nikon owners take note! The higher resolution of the D200 may expose lower end optics. The D200 must be used with better glass to see it's potential. So we're talking about a serious investment here. I currently use a 18-200VR, 12-24, Tamron 90mm Macro, 70-200VR, 50mm 1.4 and so on. Add the flash, filters and so on all ad up. The cost of a DSLR and lens package can easily hit 5K and the D200 encourages you to spend more. This is not a camera to slap 200 dollar lenses onto.In the end, with a D200 sitting next to my trusty D70, I can't say that the D200 takes better photos. What it does do is allow YOU to take better photos. If it had better ISO range it would be a 5 star camera. I've given it 3 stars because at this point Nikon should have matched Canon in this area. And by now Canon should have built a camera with proper handling. Choose your poison, folks, but I must question the value of the D200 for the high ticket price. I don't see 1000 dollars worth of advantage over a D70s. Not even close.I feel that the Nikon D70s continues to be the best DSLR on the market for the money....but if money doesn't matter and you are an advanced shooter...buy the D2Xs for 4.5K and be done. I also see the D2Hs as a superior camera even with 4MP. And the D2Hs handles noise far better. Very experienced shooters don't need 200% cropping in most cases.Does this all mean I don't like the D200? No, it's a great camera. It's just not a stunning value and should be priced at 1299.00 at the most.Capt RB", "Date": "June 15, 2006"}, {"Title": "Nikon D200 Takes the Cake!", "Author": "Brian Akerson \"http://www.AkersonStudios.com\"", "ReviewID": "R3GUGQWUFMYSK5", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I have been doing the digital side of photography for some time now. Before that, and still now, I used film. My first digital SLR was the Nikon D70, and I really loved it. It had a lot of options and good resolution for a fair price. Later I bought a Fuji S3 Pro 12.4mp digital SLR. It produces some of the most wonderful images with extreme dynamic range. My only problem with it, is that it is a bit slow in it's burst rate.It finally came to the point where I needed two fully professional camera bodies. After waiting for the D200 to come out, I finally got down to Penn Camera to see what it felt like in my hand. Unfortunately, nobody had them in stock (At least a non-gray market one) for at least another six to eight weeks. I ordered mine off the internet (Which I'm not a huge fan of, but sometimes it's required.) for a small premium and had it the next day.What a WONDERFUL camera! This was supposed to be a backup camera, and is now my primary. The way it feels in my hands is awesome. It has all the options I need and it produces wonderful looking images. The white balance options let me cut down post production in a huge way. Combined with my ExpoDisc, it produces perfect WB. Even the auto WB is something else. The metering in this camera is also a huge upgrade from the D70.I did also purchase the MB-D200 battery pack and vertical shutter release. Over the S3 Pro, I'm happy with this because this actually has command dials on it. One great thing about the MB-D200 is the fact that you can run on either one EL-EN3e batteries, two EL-EN3e batteries or six AA rechargable batteries.Overall, this camera is a massive step up for Nikon. It produces beautiful images and has all the options a pro could need. It's at a reasonable weight and is easy to handle.

After using the D100 and D70s, I purchased a D200 and quickly sold my older digital bodies to buy a second D200 for my backup.  It is hard to succintly describe which aspects of the D200 make it a superb camera, but certainly not impossible.The burst rate and the speed at which it can acquire targets through auto focus make it a superb camera for wildlife as well as sports photography.  In addition, the camera's processor allows me to shoot off several RAW images without ever losing time to pause to buffer the images.  With the D100, I could only shoot 3 or 4 RAW images before the camera would have to pause for 30-40 seconds to buffer the files, truly a madening feature when doing portrait photography: \"Hold that smile a little while longer...\"The D200 also, along with the D2X, is the only digital camera by any manufacturer that allows me to do in-camera multiple exposures.  Along with the interval exposure feature -- setting the camera to take photos at regular, specified intervals -- the multiple exposure feature returns to the photographer in-the-field creative tools that have been lost with digital.  It returns creativity in the camera, rather than relying so much on Photoshop or other photo editing tools.Finally, the larger LCD display in the back is a wonder in the field.  I also found the brightness and contrast of the display to be far more accurate to the true image than previous digital bodies.  While I still rely on my histogram for accuracy of exposure, it is nice to have a display that is more true to the image when evaluating my capture in the field.This is a sturdy, tough digital camera.  I have, as it does happen, dropped my D200 a couple of times in the field with no adverse effects.  I am confident that with the D200, with all of its features and functions, as well as the quality of its sensor and its speed, that I will be able to capture everyting I need on an assignment.  My only complaint is one that I have with both of the major digital manufacturers, and that is the susceptibility of the sensor to dust.  I find it appalling and irritating that neither Canon nor Nikon have taken steps to protect or provide self-cleaning mechanisms for the digital sensors.

When they are less than $20 each I can pick up a bunch of them and keep them in my bag.The D200 uses the Sony sensor, which is what I believe to be the same as what Sony is using in their consumer A100 DSLR camera system using the now defunct Minolta lens line.I can see from other reviews many amatures are buying the D200.  It's a good choice for a camera. I would highly suggest learning how to put the camera into the RAW Mode and playing with the images afterwards in PhotoShop CS2 with Bridge.This is a third generation digital camera body.  It's very good.  I used to shoot only medium format film.  With this camera, especially in the RAW mode, and used very carefully, I am getting  very comparable image quality to medium format.If you have a D50 or D70 and you are happy with the images it produces an upgrade to a D200 may not make a lot of sense.  I would suggest enjoying what you have for now, and waiting for the next model in a couple of years.  I've heard people who have been less than thrilled with the quality of the .jpg images as compared to the D70 (which is one of Nikon's best .jpg bodies ever!).  If, on the otherhand, you can shoot in the RAW mode, and want a beefier body, more megapixels, and more bells and whisles, this is a good choice.As for me, I don't even use this camera in the .jpg mode anymore.  I am hoping that Nikon will come out with a firmware update to improve this camera body's .jgp conversion.  When I shoot this camera in the RAW mode, I love everything about it!

Munro", "ReviewID": "R24IAEB43AYODG", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "The D200 is my second Nikon digital camera having owned a D100 for the last three years (and Nikon film cameras before that)  This is a camera that is pitched squarely at the semi-professional market or (very) serious amature.  The build quality is superb and, as a result, the camera is reassuringly heavy.  In use it is simply a dream - all the controls are easily attainable and the displays are clear & concise.  Most common settings have dedicated buttons and it's rare to have to dig into the menus.  This is fortunate as the range of settings available through the menu system is vast and can become overwhelming!  There are very few things this camera doesn't do and it's hard to justify the extra money for the fully-pro D2x unless money is no object or one needs the kudos of a pro-spec camera.I haven't mentioned image quality - in a word, it's fantastic.  I haven't been able to find fault.Before buying this camera there's a few questions you should ask yourself.  This is a pro-spec camera and could easily overwhelm inexperienced users with its range of options & settings.  ANY camera is capable of producing bad images in the hands of someone who doesn't know how to use it and, conversely, you can get great results with much cheaper models.  For all but the most serious amature the D70s is probably going to be a better option - and Nikon should shortly be releasing a new 10.2MP model aimed at the D70s market.To get the best from this camera you also need top quality lenses.  Indeed, if money is a limiting factor then I'd suggest spending less on the camera body & more on the lens as quality optics will improve your images far more than anything inside the camera body.In conclusion, this is a top quality, top spec DSLR with a specific target market in mind.  It is easily able to hold its own in the hands of a professional or semi-professional user but might well be too much for inexperienced hobbyists.", "Date": "July 26, 2006"}, {"Title": "Nikon dSLR which is nigh-on perfect", "Author": "Alexander Leach", "ReviewID": "R93J0JYC58XR1", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "The first thing is, don't buy this camera without handling it first in a store - it's pretty big and quite heavy, though the impression it gives is one of solidity rather than bulk. The magnesium alloy body is impressive with a great textured coating that feels good to grip.The Nikon D80 which has many of the same features is an alternative - it's cheaper, smaller and lighter - though not nearly as solidly built.But the ergonomics of the D200 seem so much better to me: you can amend shutter speed, aperture, shooting mode, ISO, white balance, image quality, mirror lock-up, metering, auto focus mode, focus points, and focus method - all without entering a single menu. But the other menus are a joy to use, and easy to understand too.The 230,000 pixel LCD is superb (the D80's is the same), though the method of viewing images is a little unusual and took me a while to get used to (as it can involve 3 buttons, the main command dial and the four-way controller). Without the manual at hand I found once I'd zoomed in an image, it was nigh-on impossible to leave it or view the exposure information. But once you've grasped it, it makes sense.The viewfinder is excellent, and no problem for users like me who wear glasses, although as with a friend's Canon 400D you may have to peer lower down to see the exposure information (very clear) at the bottom of the view. One good thing is that the ISO setting is included here unlike most other dSLRs in this price range.I couldn't get the diopter to magnify the viewfinder enough so I could use it without glasses though, so if this is your intention you'd be advised to check with a live camera.It's very easy to move between single and high speed shooting (the latter either at a fixed 5 shots per second, or a programmable 2-4 shots per second in Low Continuous mode). The same wheel also operates the mirror lock-up function - though be careful not to do what I did and leave that on after using a tripod, so that I could have missed a shot.The one thing I don't rate too highly is the bracketing function - which really has 2 problems. I rarely if ever use bracketing with my other cameras - and I think I'll be doing it even less with the D200, at least to begin with. First, Nikon's system is itself slightly unsatisfactory: for example you have to take the correct number of separate shots in the bracket sequence. So if you accidentally only take four instead of five of a sunny exterior, your next shot will be the last in the sequence, even if that exposure is 20 minutes later in a dark room. Result, a possible missed shot.Second, the input for setting it up seems slightly weird, and not really intuitive at all (unlike the other functions which are logical to anyone with reasonable knowledge of digital cameras). For example, the default sequence for three shots at 1/3 stop increments would be 0, -0.3, +0.3. That order seems strange to me, though you can change the sequence. Even with the manual open I struggled with this. I understand that Canon's bracketing feature is much better so if it is something you use often, head off to your local Canon dealer.But other than this small feature, this camera is a joy to use, and the results are very fine, as plenty of online reviews will tell you. Two useful features are the four shooting banks, which enable you to program settings for different subjects, and optional Intelligent ISO which raises the ISO when the parameters of optimum shutter speed and aperture (selected by you) are exceeded and would lead to incorrect exposure.There are a plethora of in-camera tweakings you can do to images, though doing it later in post-processing may be a better idea. Low light performance seems very good up to ISO 800 with little visible noise, above 1600 some processing may be required I suspect.The manual is better than I was expecting, it manages to explain some quite complex issues pretty well, and there are good indexes and references in the back.I'll give this 5 stars as it's an excellent camera with a large number of useful features, and perhaps most importantly it has been well designed and well built, the slight niggles with bracketing notwithstanding.", "Date": "January 9, 2007"}, {"Title": "6 stars", "Author": "Kevin D.

I never sold it when I got the D200.  It's my backup camera now.  The D70 is great, but nowhere near the camera that the D200 is.  I can't believe how much camera I got for such a little price.  I can make a fairly extreme crop in ACR and still end up with the same size file that the D70 would give me without a crop.  Still, this isn't the main reason that I purchased this camera.  If I just wanted extra megapixels, I would have bought the D80.Where this camera shines is in its layout and design.  Of course the performance and picture quality are excellent.  But what I love is how all of the major adjustments that are made have dedicated buttons or switches.  It allows me to change settings without taking my eye from the viewfinder.  I also love the fact that the ISO is displayed in the viewfinder.  I know that the next generations will have better high ISO output, maybe better dynamic range, more this, faster that...  That's how it goes.

This is a pro camera.I have heard/read of many pros who are putting down their D2X and their 5Ds and using this one exclusively for the simple reason this one takes great pictures and weighs half as much.

Don't skimp on lenses. Nikon lenses work best on Nikon cameras just like Canon lenses work best on Canon bodies. Get the gold ring Nikon lenses if you can afford them.

I'm not afraid of using the D200 even when image quality is paramount, because I find it difficult to detect much of a difference between the 10.2 MP files of this camera and the 12.4 MP output of my D2X.  The D200 is even quite acceptable for sports, as its autofocus is admirably fast, and its 5 fps bursts satisfactory for anything short of the D2X's 8 fps high speed crop mode.Apparently Nikon had solved the \"banding\" issue by February, as I am unable to detect any banding in my D200.

I did not expect this from a brand new unit but understand it's easily cleaned...The noise issue: I agree with other owners who've reported higher-than-expected levels of pixelization noise in shadow areas even at moderatley low ISOs (but not in solid \"black\" areas); This has been a major disappointment, especially in a camera which is otherwise \"sharp\" when coupled with high-quality Nikkor lenses (which this is)...The Matrix metering tends to overexpose about .3 to 1.0 in my most frequent applications - another surprise considering my other camera, a Nikon N90S metered spot-on perfect in Matrix with the exact same lenses (but very simply compensated-for with the +/- dial)...Other nitpicks: The 'C'/'S'/'M' switch is easily changed by accident if you're gripping the lens where it meets the front of the body. Also, I predict early failure of the battery housing door because of poor latch design. The plastic flash hood is alarmingly light-weight and cheap-feeling...Now the Good News : FAST!

In the film days, I was using Nikon products.  In my initial foray into digital photography, I switched to Canon (10D) just to see what's on the other side of the fence.  After about three years, I switched back to Nikon because the Nikon products suits me better.No, this is not a \"Canon sucks, Nikon rules\" review.  One thing I learned about digital photography is that you should really decide not on the camera body itself, but on the whole lineup...including the lenses and accessories.  For me, the Nikon lens line-up works for me better, not because Canon has worse line-up...I'm sure a lot of photographers find the Canon line-up much more sensible.Now, on to the camera itself: I've own this camera for over a year and has sold a number of stock images using this camera.  Suffice to say, I'm very satisfied with its performance; I'm not going to re-iterate the praises that's been said in the previous reviews.What I am compelled to say are the not-so-great characteristics of this camera: in ISO400 and above, it is not very forgiving to underexposure.  if you did not nail the exposure, even in RAW you will see noise in the shadow area when you try to correct the exposure in the RAW software converter.  This is why you hear a lot of whining from D200 owners regarding \"noise.\"  Most of them don't nail exposure the first time and try to adjust in RAW converter...and then BAM! noise in the shadows.Auto White balance becomes iffy as well in underexposure; everything becomes biased to magenta in underexposure; and this is very hard to correct even in post-processing.The Nikon Creative Lighting System is I believe the feature that makes Nikon a little better than Canon in artificial lighting exposure.  Basically, Nikon has designed their flash system with multiple flashes in mind.The Nikon auto-focus engine is better than most Canon folks tend to evangelize.  With AFS lenses I'm positive it's as fast as any Canons.  If there's one thing I would like to change in future iterations of this product: I NEED MORE THAN ONE CROSS-TYPE AF POINTS!  The newer Pentax DSLR has NINE out of its 11 AF points!  This is beneficial to a more accurate focus.So my recommendation...if you already have Nikon lenses, and thinking if it's worth the price difference to jump from a D40/D50/D70.  It's unequivocably a \"YES.\"  If you're just starting with a DSLR system, I say look closely on what Nikon/Canon/Pentax/Olympus/Leica/Sigma has to offer as a whole system then decide.

I will try to quickly note the pros and cons below.Pros:- Value/Price: At the current price of $1699, this camera is a steal! It delivers near pro quality at a consumer price tag.- Resolution: 10 MP is a lot of data. Enlargments at 20\"x30\" look superb from this camera, and even prints up to 40\"x60\" look pretty good. This delivers enough resolution for 95% or more of the potential buyers.- Performance: 5 frames per second make this camera pretty fast. Add in the fact that color rendition is near perfect, and auto focus and metering are spot on. This camera performs similar to a pro SLR.- Customer service: Nikon lenses come with a 5 year warranty, Canon lenses come with a 1 year warranty. Canon currently is experiencing serious quality control problems, even with their \"L\" glass (Think I'm kidding? Search the web for Canon lens quality control and see what you find). Nikon rarely has problems, but when they do they are very helpful. Instead \"fixing\" the problem at their repair facilities, they send you a new product, in most cases.- User control/features: The D200 features a very large and bright LCD, and an intuitive menu. Every commonly used control has a button shortcut somewhere on the camera. The bright and detailed histograms won't dissapoint! The layout on this camera is simply perfect.- Build: Very tough and durable, weather sealed as well. Feels like it will last forever.Cons:- Noise: Because of the chip design (different than the CMOS chips Canon uses) digital noise is a factor at high ISO's and long exposures. NIK Dfine is a photoshop software plug-in (one of many) that reduces noise without losing much or any sharpness/detail. Therefore, noise isn't a huge issue.- Availability: As of now 6/22/06, there are not many of these in stock anywhere. Accesories are even harder to find, and the prices for many of D200 add-ons has jumped. Once supply cathces up with demand, this shouldn't be a problem.- Wide angle: With a 1.5x crop, this camera doesn't work as well for wide angle photography. Nikon does offer a great 10.5mm fisheye and a 12-24mm lens, but those who already have a wide angle from before are going to be out of luck. Not a huge issue for some, and it makes up for it a bit by catering to the telephoto crowd.In my opinion, the good outweighs the bad, by a landslide. I used to have a Canon 5D, but switched over to Nikon and bought this camera. The D200 offers a professionla build, with near pro performance, coupled with easy to use controls, and a lower price than comparable digital SLR's. This makes the D200 a clear winner in my book, not the best at anything in particular, but it does whatever you ask of it, and does it very well.

Most the digital stuff I've owned have been pretty disappointing. Agreed, anyone who buys a Nikon 990 for $900 when it first arrived probably should have their head examined. Call me an \"early adopter\". This time I was going to wait. I held off on my desire to purchase the D70, after my sister, who is a professional photographer bought it and in short order gave it to her son to use on school projects and hasn't seen it since (read: thought it was trash).So I passed on the D70. But, when the D200 came around I could not hold my impluse any longer. I bought. Albeit with the less than optimal 18-200 lens that everyone is a-gaga about. The standard lens that ships, is just fine for me. (17-100 or close to that). Here's the deal. This camera is a dream.

I've been too busy taking pictures with the thing to spend time writing reviews.This thing is tough. I have taken pictures in tropical typhoons, in rain forest, on beaches with blowing sand, on snow covered mountain tops, hanging out of an airplane window. It goes with me everywhere. Never a lost picture or hiccup. No blinking green light of death like the D70. This camera represents how Nikon made its name. A camera tough enough to go anywhere from black tie to jungle, and keep on performing.Controls are laid out nicely. Yeah, there is an LCD on top and you have to take your eye away from the camera to see it, but it is repeated in the viewfinder. The viewfinder is bright and clear. The camera feels like an extension of your arm.On the front of the camera you find the lens mount, preview buttons, a switch for focusing modes, and a port for a shutter release. Now, this camera does not use the handy little remote that is available for the smaller Nikon DSLRs. Instead, you have to hook up a remote to the shutter release port. Although it is more klunky, you do have more options.The side has ports for USB 2.0. If you are smart, you will never use these and use memory card readers instead. Their real purpose is capture of images in real time onto a laptop if you are doing studio work.The back has the LCD, of course. There is no image preview. You have to compose and focus using the optical viewfinder. This is true of all DSLRs of the D200's generation and it is still the best way to compose and focus even on cameras that do have Live View or Image Preview or whatever you want to call it. The reason is that holding the camera out at arm's length to view the LCD is not a very good way to hold the camera steady.There are the typical playback and menu buttons, as well as a switch for choosing focusing mode and one for focus/exposure lock which also allows you to choose between spot, average, or 3D metering. On top you set multiple exposure modes (or timer), mirror lock-up to reduce vibration (as opposed to mirror lock-up for sensor cleaning), white balance, ISO, picture quality, mode, exposure bracketing, and on/off/LCD light. You typically adjust these by pressing the button and turning one of two wheels mounted on the back or the front of the camera at the top of the grip. It is slick and you can tell how much you are adjusting things simply by counting clicks. You never have to look at the settings if you don't want to.The sensor is not self-cleaning. No camera of the D200's age has a self-cleaning sensor; however, it is hardly a necessity. There is a flash on top that can be used in commander mode to control off-camera strobes using the Creative Lighting System -- a fantastically flexible lighting system that rivals the best third party pro setups.Nikon cameras are infamous for producing 'noise' in their pictures, but you have to wonder about people who seem to only shoot at ISO 2500 or above. You never did that with film and I suspect that a lot of people are using noise reducing algorithms to cover for their bad photography. The Nikon tells it like it is. It does not cover your tracks if you misuse it.A lot has been said about battery life. Well, I have never been able to run down two batteries in a single day. The fact is, a set of batteries in an SB-800 flash will not last even a third as long as the battery in the camera. Batteries recharge quickly, so if you had three batteries and kept one on a charger all the time, you would be extremely unlikely to shoot fast enough to run out of batteries. The batteries should be recharged frequently and should not be allowed to be drained completely.I find Nikon's color rendering to be the most pleasing and natural of any digital SLR.

I did not like it at all.  You really had to go in and adjust the parameters to capture the look that I was going for.  The small body was anoying and amaturish, and I was getting frustrated with the fact that I spent 1000+ 380 for a image stabalizer that really did not live up to my expectations.  I ended up walking into J&R; in the city and I saw the Nikon D200 glowing in the case.  As soon as I picked it up, my credit card went down!The 2.5 inch LCD is amazing and can be viewed from any angle.  It has a multi-exposure option that is rediculous, and it feels like my old nikon SLR, just lighter.  Right after I bought this camera I had to power it up and see what it can do.  So i stopped at a deli ate lunch and put it together.  Right after I took some of the best pictures that I have ever taken right out of the box.  Switching to manual is a breeze as the ISO, W/B, and other features are so easy to setup compared to canons go through every menu mode.My Canon is on ebay now, and whatever loss I am going to take it doesnt compare to the happiness that the Nikon D200 brings me.  This camera can do everything.  I paid 2000 for the kit (with 18-70 mm lens) which is pretty good.

I took about 2000 photos - some portraits, but mostly lanscapes.The camera performed without any problem.Image colors are very good (I used color mode 3, sharpening +2).Matrix metering are very good - but not fool proof.May need two batteries to shoot a whole day.Low ISO, D200 is a fine camera (solid 5 stars). High ISO (3 stars)Original Review:This review compares D200 with D70(s) for those thinking to get one of these. I will not compare specs because that topic is readily available elsewheres. I'll give value, relative to D70(s), for each important different feature (based on my opinion and usage) so that you can see the relative values between the two cameras. Positive value means D200 is better.1) Body construction: +$2002) Max Frame rate:  +$1003) Max Flash Sync Speed:  -$1004) Mirror Lock Up: +$505) Remote Shutter Release: -$506) Time Interval Shooting: +$507) Focus Speed: +$1008) Resolution: +$2009) White Balance: +$15010) Color: +$15011) Moire: +$10012) Banding: -$10013) Noise: $014) MF Lens: +50Adding all up: +$900. At current prices, D200 is about $1000 more that D70(s).Compare to D70(s), the colors and white ballances of the images from D200 is much better. In general, the images from D200 are very good straight from the camera.  However, post processing may be still needed to get the images you want. It is easier to get great images from D200 than from D70(s).I have a few classic Nikon MF lenses. Though they are usable with D200 (with metering), manual focus is difficult because the viewfinder is not very bright (brighter than D70, but not as good as film camera).D200 is a great camera. Nikon must spend a lot of time designing this camera, and they did a great job.There are things that D200 can be improved:1) Cut down noise at high ISO, especially in dark area2) In addition to having mirror lockup and self timer separately, also have self timer with mirror lockup.3) Better dynamic range4) Brighter viewfinder5) Eliminate banding completley (currently, short banding may still exists under special situation)6) Have an external button to select image style (D200 called image optimization). For example, select between vivid (landscape), portrait, custom 1, custom 2, etc.7) Have remote shutter release, like D70(s)8) Improve battery life, like D70(s)9) Improve flash sync speed, like D70(s)10) Current AF of D200 is very good, however it can be improved to the same level as in D2X.I know that the wish list above is a little much.  But I believe and hope that Nikon do take our wishes into consideration when they design their next cameras.

I recently went to Europe and decided to upgrade cameras for the trip.  My decision was really a no-brainer, once I held this beauty in the Camera store.  It just is the best piece of craftsmanship I have ever owned.  Nikon truly rocks!  I have shot ~4000 photos on my D200!That said, what are the biggest reasons to spend ~$2000 for a camera?1) Quality of pictures - bar none, you will be elated at your results. This camera will take the absolute best pictures you have ever taken in your life!  That's the reason for buying any camera, and I'm telling you, you will not be disappointed!2) Control.  You own your images with this camera.  Whatever you ask of it, it will deliver.  Tough lighting, fast moving subjects, difficult conditions - it will not matter, you shots will consistantly of excellent quality.3) Ease of use.  Make no mistake, this camera is a wonder to use, but controls, settings and flexibility are still within your reach.  It is too easy to take great shots with this camera. Way too easy.  You will be completely surprised at the ease with which you fill up your CF card with hundreds of great images.What more can I say?  Oh, yeah... the negatives.  OK, so here's what I can share:1). If you are a novice digital photographer - this camera will work for you, but learn your tool.  The book it comes with is 1/2 inch thick.  There is a reason for it, so read it.  If you don't/can't read manuals, buy a CoolPix and just be happy.  This camera will work out of the box, but without knowing how things work, you'll still get great pictures, but you should take get great pictures on purpose, not by accident.  I read my manual every few weeks.2) It weighs 12-14 ounces. Join a gym, workout and buy a good camera bag.  After a 10 hour day of sightseeing, you be glad you did.  Accept the fact that this is a great piece of equipment, and don't worry about dragging it around with you.  I have never regretting bringing my D200 with me, ever.3) Do not, repeat, do not drop your D200 - ever.  If your are inherently clumsy by a CoolPix and be happy.  This camera is built out of magnesium and very durable, don't get me wrong - it can take some abuse.  But the lens will inevitable hit the concrete first, and if it does, it will be toast.  This is pretty much true of any camera.That's it, no more negs on this camera, but I do have one suggestion. If you are an intermediate to advanced photographer and want to really learn to use the D200, the intricacies of it, the art of it and nearly instantly become a much, much better photographer, here is what I did:On the net, there is a fabulous site that Ken Rockwell put up on photography, cameras, technical reference and comparisons; [...]  Check out his site and I'm sure you'll agree.  I have read all his content on the D200 and am much more \"fluent\" with my camera for it. He writes so you understand and enjoy reading it. He isn't selling anything and there's no product ads, so his site is truly a joy.  Not to mention, he absolutely knows his stuff.No kidding, it really is awesome.So beg or borrow if you have to, but go to your favorite site or store and buy this camera!

I purchased the optional battery pack with the camera body, and with this set up, it's difficult to tell the D200 from the more expensive D2X.I was impressed with the D70S when it came out, and I enjoyed many hours of use with it. It's not a camera to sneeze at...But the D200 is in a whole other zip code in comparison.If you're a Nikon digital fan, then the D200 will satisfy your digital itch sufficiently. However, even though it's not a difficult camera to get aquainted with, I believe the D70S or a D50 would be a better choice for those just breaking into the DSLR field from film. This is without a doubt a Pro class  camera, and I look for sales of the D2X to fall because of it. Nikon has already started offering a $500 rebate on the D2X, which may indicate the publics reaction to this new piece. You just can't hardly find a D200 available...This should tell you something.All I can say, it is worth the wait...no, it's not the best thing since sliced bread, but in comparison to what's on the market at this point in time, it is a great buy and will serve even the most picky among us.", "Date": "May 8, 2006"}, {"Title": "Don't even think twice about buying this Camera!", "Author": "T.

The camera and lens are simply amazing!  The learning curve is somewhat big on this camera, but with the Blue Crane DVD, Nikons owners manual and Nikon's online video tutor, I already understand most of the functions well enough to take awesome shots. In a pinch you can point and shoot, but the real power of the D200 is in the \"easy to understand\" menu system for customization. There are literally thousands, if not millions of, options/combinations at your finger tips. You can save 4 different custom settings, and or reset the menus to default anytime.The camera is solidly built, and fits well in my large hands with all of the basic controls at my fingertips (IE...White balance, ISO, Image Quality, Focus Mode, Exposure compensation, Metering, Depth of field preview button...etc.) I also purchased the Nikon MB-D200 Multi-Power Battery Pack and an extra Nikon EN-EL3e Rechargeable Li-Ion Battery. I love the feel of the camera with the grip. The camera does suck the juice, especially if you use the LCD to review and use the menu system a lot. That may be the only negative but is a small price to pay for all the features you get inside this beauty! I don't see it ever being a problem with the double battery power pack though. And if you are in a bind, the power pack also takes AA batteries. Another plus!The auto focus is incredible too. It takes a little practice to get use too, but WOW, does it ever work! My advice, if you have the extra money, is to buy this camera with the 18-200mm Nikkor lens. It is so versatile, I don't even know if I'll need another lens in my bag.  If you are thinking about purchasing this camera, just buy it...you won't be dissapointed at all! I was debating between the D80 & D200, and am so glad I spent the extra money on the D200! In the long run, the added features of the D200 over the D80 are well worth it for me. Bottom line: The Nikon D200 rocks! 5 HUGE STARS!NOTE: Don't forget to add a compact flash memory card with your purchase. The camera does not come with a card....

Buy the D200 instead and get some great glass instead. Unless you are a \"pro\" and getting paid big money, this D200 is just amazing. Had mine for 2 years and have banged it around, got it wet, hot, cold etc. this camera really just goes and goes. I am an amateur with no \"Pro\" pretensions but this camera is the D2x's little brother in that the chunky steel and magnesium sealed body, that is all switches dials and doors, this camera is set for the rigors of pro life. I think anyone thinking of using this camera for extended stints should also get the MB-D200 battery grip. Takes 2 of the Nikon EN-EL3 batteries or 6 AA batteries in a pinch with the adapter. The D200 in comparison with my older D70s loves battery power, though I have never run out of power especially with the battery grip before my shooting was done, it does make me concerned. Main reason why I carry 3 camera batteries and a ton of rechargeable AA batteries. In conjunction with the battery grip and the terrific Nikon SB-800 flash this camera is fabulous for special event picture taking like weddings, and also super for Museum photography as well. My trips to the Chino Air museum and the Boeing Museum of flight were just amazing with the D200. Airplanes taken with this camera are just amazing. I love engines and this camera renders the details just great. For fast action race car shooting this cameras 5 frames per second is great too.A note about exposure. Don't underexpose and the \"noise\" that the D200 can produce will not harm your pictures. At higher ISO settings at underexposed images chromatic and luminance noise will rear its ugly head. A weakness of the CCD imager that is just about abandoned by Nikon. The D300 uses the CMOS imager with superior performance in the noise arena.Unlike the lower cost D series Nikon's this D200 will take any autofocus lens whether it has a motor in the lens or not. The D40 and D60 family of cameras will not. The D200 has a built in motor for the lens focus drive built into the body. So while not perfect, I find that I make many more mistakes than my D200 ever does, however when I do what I am supposed to do, the D200 is absolutely amazing.Another note, since this is a \"advanced\" enthusiast's camera the \"Scene\" modes will be not present. I never use them and therefore don't miss them.The D200 also takes the Compact flash 1 and 2 format cards and IBM microdrive with no problems. However the camera is too old to understand ULTRA DMA cards so don't waste the money on those cards with this camera. With the Sandisk Extreme 3, 4 gig card this camera never let me down with a missed shot ever.With a shutter speed of 1/8000th of a second and only a 1/250th flash sync speed (my D40 and older D70 had 1/500th second flash sync) you will do well to get that shot.Menus a plenty, take the time to get your D200 setup the way you want it and you will be glad you did. Custom menus abound, of which I found no use to me, but may be valuable to others. The menus while fairly clear are many and fortunately for most, it would be a one time setup affair.The mirror lock up feature is nice to check depth of field, something I don't see on a lot of other cameras.Durability and reliability have been excellent with no issues what so ever.I read about an independent reviewer who dropped the camera about 5 feet to concrete on the grip and LCD status panel side, and the repair was only $250.00 or so. Pretty good performance since most cameras would be way worse.Who wants this older camera vs. the D300 say. Someone who wants to save money and get about 7 to 8 tenths the D300 and buy better lenses for the difference maybe. Ones moving up to a better body but doesn't want the D90 and wants something more substantial. The D200 will not disappoint.Others wanting the latest and greatest will undoubtedly buy the D300 and that makes sense too. For me, and I tried the D300, other than the higher ISO low light performance being better and a better LCD screen, it still was not compelling enough for me to move over to it. I want one sure, but maybe when the price comes down, and even then, it would have to be allot before I give up the D200. I think it is that good.

I have a feeling that like the Canon 30D and 5D this camera will continue to hold value very well even as similar vintage models have lost most of theirs.If I had to sum up this camera in one word it would this one: exposure. Exposure is arguably the most important factor in judging the quality of a photo. It is certainly one of the most important if not the most important. This camera has an amazingly great talent at picking the correct exposure. There are countless sites that explain the technical reasons behind this that you are welcome to go and seek out, but I don't want this review to be 3 pages long so I will forgo detailing them again here. Bottom line, you can't ask for anything more in this regard from this camera. You will get shots with this camera that you would have lost with the D40, D50, D60, D70, D80 and D90 due to incorrect exposure. Of course if you had the time, ability, and equipment you could spend 10-15 on each shot to make sure you manually set everything correctly to get that perfect exposure. Most of us don't have the time, however, or don't want to spend the time (and the $300 for a good light meter) so it is a joy to work with a camera like this. The D40-D90s get exposure right too of course, just not as often as the D200 does.Low-light performance: I feel like I have to start including this in my camera reviews now since everyone seems to care about this much more than they did just 2-3 years ago. Bottom line, it's real simple: this is not a low-light performer. You know what? I could care less! If I need low-light performance I'll grab a 5D or a D3. Honestly, even when I had a 5D I rarely, rarely ever shot at ISO 800 or higher. ISO 100-400 is how I roll. You know what? The D200 is awesome at ISO 100 through ISO 400! No problem here for me. ISO 800 and ISO 1600 are not good. I would have a very hard time selling a photo made at these levels and an equally hard time making a print larger than 5x7. Again, to me this is not slight. I didn't buy the D200 for low-light performance and you shouldn't either. If you need to shoot at ISO 800 and up then you need to get a faster lens, an external flash, or better yet both.IQ more generally: saturation, contrast, color and clarity are great with this sensor, again as long as you keep the ISO to 400 and lower. At ISO 800 the sensor goes from Dr. Jekyll to Mr. Hyde. Not only do you get a huge mess of noise that renders the pictures mostly unusable, but everything else (except clarity and sharpness) seems to suffer, too.Ergonomics: outstanding. I love the ergonomics on the D50 through D700 models. The location of the buttons is also typically Nikon in its intelligence.Pop up flash: don't ever use it unless it is an emergency. this goes for every other DLSR pop-up flash, too. They are a joke. Either don't use it or buy an external flash. I don't know of a serious photographer who would use a built-in flash on a DLSR unless it was an emergency and not using the flash meant getting no picture at all (i.e. it's 3:00AM and you are witnessing breaking news).Battery life: this may be the one downside to this camera. It is not the best. You will probably want to buy an extra battery. This is one of the worst when it comes to DLSRs I have used over the years. I don't know what accounts for this but thankfully Nikon ironed it out with every DLSR made after the D200.I could talk some more but it would be superfluous at this point I guess given that this camera has already been exhaustively reviewed by people much more capable and knowledgeable than I. Bottom line, this is the Pro-Sumer DLSR at this price point. At this price point, you can not buy another better DLSR. If you have $200 more dollars I would probably go with the D90, however. I do think it is worth the extra money. That being said, this is a classic and the fact that 3 years later (a generation in DLSR years) Nikon made the D90 and it came out slightly better does not in any way take away from the greatness of this camera. I mention it merely because the D90 is a current Nikon offering priced not too far above this one and I do believe it is slightly superior in most ways except the exposure. If you are on a budget and need a pro-sumer grade DLSR then this is the one.This is one of those rare 5 star products that you can instantly disregard all 4 star and under reviews for. If a reviewer gave this 4 stars or less then they do not know what they are talking about or they simply bought the wrong camera for their needs. At the time of writing this review, only 16 out of 138 reviewers gave this anything less than 5 stars. That's right: 122 out of 138 reviewers gave this camera 5 stars. If this isn't a clear consensus then I don't understand the definition of the word consensus. Sorry, but it's not a matter of opinion--the people have spoken.

I'm just an amateur who enjoys photography. I tried the Digital Rebel, Olympus E-500, Nikon D-50 and D-40: these were all fine cameras, but they still seemed lacking to me. I thought that the Canon EOS-30D was terrific with it's 5fps, build quality, and numerous options, but the price was still too steep. After mulling it over long and hard, I decided to spend even more money and get the D200. This is a camera that I won't feel is lacking for a very long time. It's at the sweet spot of the price/performance curve: after this point, I think that diminishing returns begin unless you're a professional who relies on their camera for a living. I am most impressed with the exposure meter and the LCD review screen: it seems to get exposures correct much more often than the other cameras that I've tried. I spent a lot of time changing settings on the other cameras to get the right exposure, but the D200 gets it right most of the time in Programmed Auto! The LCD screen accurately shows the picture that was taken; whereas, the other cameras' screens would show different results than would ultimately appear on my monitor or in print. One more great feature that the Canon EOS-30D didn't have is Auto ISO: this is awesome, and it works great!I suggest that every newbie to this camera go to Ken Rockwell's site and download his free D200 user's guide: he explains the camera and all of its settings in straightforward language. He tells you how he configures his D200 and why he configures it that way. I found the manual much easier to comprehend after reading his guide.

Others have nobly tried but a Nikon remains the high bar that others only hope to reach.When the shift from film to digital began, there was some speculation if Nikon could keep up with the competition.  Well, rest assure that not only have they kept up, they continue to lead the way.  The latest example of this is the D200.Like the D70/ D80 - this is a solid piece of equipment.  Just the feel of it tells you that you are holding an excellent piece of technology.  But the proof will always be in the end results and again, the combination of the Nikon know-how and Nikon lenses lead even a beginner to come up with excellent pictures.Gone is the \"lag between shots\".  You can fire up and shoot multiple pictures in seconds so action shots are all yours.  Without even \"tweaking\" a picture with a computer program, you can print top of the line photos at home.People have cited the cons:  Expensive.  Yes.  The camera does come with a hefty price tag but it should be kept in mind that this is a piece of machinery intended for serious photographers.  If you are a \"vacation and holiday\" picture taker, then you should elect to buy a cheaper camera.  The same is true with the difficulty of the multitude of small buttons, dials and switches.  There are too many and they can be overwhelming but only to someone who is in the \"point and shoot\" school of picture taking.  Anyone else will relish the options that Nikon has provided us with on the D200.Room for improvement?  Well, the battery life is nowhere near as good as the D70 which I upgraded from but that is a weak complaint as you can still get hundreds of shots on one charge.

The D200 is not completely rubber-encased. There's rubber where your hands need to hold it, and plastic where your hands rarely touch it. The hand grip is comfortable and nicely concave where the tips of your fingers can dig in.The battery door and the memory card door are made of plastic, and hinge-pinned. A simple slide latch opens the battery door. The memory card door latch, however, uses a more secure 45 degree pivoting latch.USB 2 and Video Out/DC-in doors are made of flexible rubber, and these doors extend into the body of the camera as the hinges themselves.The English language operating manual is a work of art. Each operating concept is alpha' & numerically numbered at the pictoral diagram, and to the page where the function is explained in perfect English. The reader will quickly catch on to how this well thought out manual is organized.I like the depth of field preview, the mirror lock-up, and the multiple-exposure capability.The continuous servo autofocus does a better job than any human at following and focusing on any moving object.If you have the old manual-focus, film-based Nikon SLR lenses from the '70's and '80's, except for a few rare exceptions, will fit on the D200.Out of box, only two \"tweaks\" were needed: increase the color saturation by a factor of 1, and dial down the exposure compensation to minus 0.7 (-0.7 ev).All these positive attributes remind me of the best, most highly-evolved film camera SLR's.

I got great pictures with it but it was too large and heavy to lug around for extended periods.  I also had some issues with its operation.  But now, Nikon seems to have solved my issues with the D200.  I purchased the dedicated SB-800 flash and 18-200 lens recommended in the D200's manual.  The whole system is much improved over my other digital SLR.  Both focus and metering seem to work more reliably.  It works better in available light.  The optical anti-vibration aids in overall picture sharpness (plus for those of us who are not rock-steady).  I am getting use to the button sequence required to enlarge the picture preview and really like the amount of magnification possible.  The menuing system seems quite extensive and well-organized.  I would like more latitude in the picture quality settings (e.g. contract, saturation, and sharpness).  The help screens really tell me something when I'm confused.  I appreciate the \"modeling\" feature.  It is useful when attempting to compose in a dark situation.  It also lets me see reflections BEFORE they are committed to the picture.  Unfortunately this feature does not work using the built-in flash.  I wish Nikon could add some type of lock on the continuous-single-manual focus selector on the front of the camera.  My finger seems to move that switch unknowingly.  I would appreciate a battery charger with a built in plug rather than the detachable cord.  As a person who still wears thick glasses, I wish Nikon could make the viewfinder more like the one on their old N8008.

Ergonomics, build quality, performance are all outstanding. All it lacks is better high ISO image quality.I was an early adopter of the D200, buying mine in late December, 2005. It replaced a Fuji S2 Pro which I had chosen over the D100 (in retrospect, a wise choice). I've been a Nikon SLR shooter since the late 1960s, so never considered other than an F-mount DSLR. My camera did exhibit the early D200 banding problem, but only in extreme situations. It went back to Nikon and was quickly fixed.Compared to either the Fuji S2 or the D70s I got for my wife, this camera is 100% pro quality in build and performance. Compared to the Fuji, the image quality is improved, but not by a huge margin. Metering and menus are better, as well.I'm a part-time pro shooter, doing mainly landscapes and fine art photography, but I've shot a few marathons, and the D200 has the speed and buffer capacity to handle them nicely. Although it's a bit slow switching from my 28mm f2 to my 105mm f2.5, it's great that Nikon accommodated these superb old AiS manual focus lenses.One of the appealing qualities of the D200 is the package of size/weight/performance. My last Nikon SLR was the F5. It was a tank, just like the D2X I've used. I learned with the F5 that I was paying too high a price in size and weight for a lot of features I never used. True, the D200 is not a great party camera. But it is the right package for most \"serious\" photography.Since it appears that the D300 resolves my high-ISO complaints about the D200, I'll be adding one of those to my bag in the spring after prices settle down.

Cooper \"Conspicuous Consumer\"", "ReviewID": "R175WNRZDVF1BR", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Don't get me wrong, this is a great camera, but it could have been so much more. Like many, I moved up from a D70, which is a spectacular camera with few shortcomings. One of those shortcomings was the ability to save custom settings. Well the D200 was supposed to solve that problem with 4 custom settings banks, and 4 more shooting menu banks. Why 2 sets of banks, you ask? Beats the hell out of me, and in my opinion, they're all pretty much worthless.Take the custom settings banks. By my count there are about 56 different settings. So you go into Bank A and set all of them for your needs. If one of those settings is something you always use, you have to change it in each of the 4 banks separately. So, you've got your custom settings set up for Bank A and you start shooting. You need to change an option for a shot or two, so you scan through all the settings, find the one you want, and change it. Guess what! That's where it stays until you set it back. So what's the point really? And wouldn't it be nice if you could just see what you changed on a menu? Nope, you still have to go through ALL the settings every time, including the stupid ones that you'll never change in your lifetime. I could go on, but do you get my point? I use Auto-ISO all the time (the camera automatically raises ISO to achieve a desired shutter speed). But to turn it off and on, which I do frequently, I have to go through the menus to do so.The D200 has 3 buttons conveniently located for easy checking or adjustment. Picture Quality, ISO, and White Balance. These are a great feature, and easy to use. So why have them as menu options, too?On the positive side, the camera is solidly built. It's nice having the extra resolution (although Nikon's consumer level dSLR should have that by the time you read this). You can see the ISO in the viewfinder, very helpful. Focusing and exposure seem much more accurate than the D70. The screen is large and easy to view. Battery life remaining is much easier to determine, but battery life itself is pitifully short (I guess that big screen and those VR lenses help drain the battery). With the D70, I could always feel confident that I could get in a full days shooting on a charge. Not so with the D200. One more thing is remote shutter release. The D70 had a great little IR remote which set you back <$20. Try to accomplish the same on the D200 and it'll cost you almost $200. Just a simple cable release is about $35 if I remember correctly.

I started out my Nikon adventure with the Nikon N70 film camera. I then moved up to the Nikon Cool PIX 950 then 990. Neither of these cameras had removable lenses and were toys. A couple of yeas ago I moved up to the Nikon D100. This is a very fine camera, but is too complex for the average user.Out of the box the D200 has evolved in so many ways. Nikon has vastly simplified the camera user interface to where it makes sense. For instance, for general shooting the use can put the camera into the totally automatic shooting mode, \"P.\"  There are just four modes of operation. The first is, \"P,\" which I just mentioned. The second it the aperture preferred, \"A,\" mode. The next is the shutter preferred, \"A,\" mode. The last is the total manual, \"M,\" mode. All of these controls are right on the top of the camera by the right hand along with the E/V control and the two dials that control the aperture and shutter speed.  On the other side are the controls for White Balance, ISO setting and Image Quality settings.I use my camera mostly for still life, but have lately been shooting people. In gatherings like picnics under shelters or in rental halls it is advisable to buy the Nikon SB-800 flash.My first test of this camera was taking some macro photos. I put a few of this on Flickr [...] to demonstrate the camera. These were taken with a Nikon Micro-Nikor 60mm lens and a Sigma 30-200 mm zoom. They are all hand held images and with poor outdoor lighting.I have been having difficulties in taking large objects with too little room to shoot. I got a Nikon 18 - 55 mm wide angle zoom which now allows this camera to capture thins like cars that are behind a rope in a single frame. I also want to take pictures of a brand new Victorian carousel in the area. I needed a wider angle to individually photograph each animal without the fence around it. This as well as other Nikon cameras magnify the image size by 1.5 times. My new 18-55 mm lens is actually 27 - 82.5 mm. This was also true for the D100.Ergonomically this is an excellent camera. I have extremely painful arthritis in my hands and fingers. I have just shot three events with this camera each even was from one and a half to three hours long. At the end of each shoot I never notice any extra pain from strain. I guess that they place all the dials and buttons in the correct place. I usually use the neck strap to carry the camera around my neck when shooting. I always hold the camera by my sit ready to shoot. It seams to have a very good balance / feel to it. I have not had a single pre-fire / miss-fire yet. However, I wish that they had put the lens mode selector in a different place. I have on two occasions moved the selector from single to manual. I do admit that I tens to gram more camera than I should. For my next test I am planning to try shooting through my microscope. My D100 works well with the microscope I believe that the D200 should work as well.I believe that Nikon has a real winner with the D200. In all the ways that I like to use a camera it is working out quite well. If you have had some experience with other type digitals it should be very easy to switch over.

Its got a proper LCD display and you can control 95%+ of the functions and settings you need using only the buttons and the LCD display.  I've no doubt that the D300 is a better camera - but its also a a LOT more expensive and I'd argue that unless you make money out of photography its a bit more than you need?If you are new to dSLR photography then the former models may be better suited to you as they have helpful scene settings - but once you become experienced and start understaning DSLR photography and manipulating RAW files etc. this is the camera for you.Oh and the camera also takes excellent photos!

The quality of the images are, as you probably already have found out, very good, and the build quality very good indeed. What I have found to be most rewarding about this little piece of kit is how practical it is. It is big and heavy enough to feel like a proper camera and have a nice feel in your hands. Ergonomically thought through I would say. It has very easy access to key features via separate buttons on the camera (ISO, picture quality, etc) which makes visits to the dreaded menu system of any DSLR less frequent. It is for example also very easy to delete unwanted photos with a couple of pushes of a button. The outlay and use of the whole piece of equipment is very entuitive and makes it quite possible to take the camera out of the box and start taking photographs almost straight away. Good battery life, on-board flash, high continuous shooting rate, and enough pixels to satisfy the most of us makes this a very decent camera, even today.There are newer models out there, sure, but they are not necessarily the better choice. The D300 is a better camera, all in all. Of course it is. But there's quite a bit of a difference in the pricing of the two models. Normally I wouldn't advocate buying an older model when its replacement has been on the market for a year or so, but at this price, I honestly think that the D200 is worth getting. Get the 17-55mm Nikon lens (or any piece of properly sharp glass), and you'll have as good photographs as with any camera. If you're looking for a really good camera at a low price, then I reckon the D200 is (or at least should be) a serious competitor. If you take a thousand photographs a week you'll probably want something newer and heavier, but then again, you probably already have. If, on the other hand, you need a camera for your holidays, trekkings, and the odd sportsevent, this is, in my opinion at least, a very decent choice indeed.5 stars.

So I made the jump when a price drop happened, got the D200 for $599 NEW from a competitor online.You can't compare the processing speed or 3D AF of the D300 to the D200, completely blow the socks off of this nearly 4 year old body.But if you are a beginner like me and would like a semi-pro/pro body that has ALL of the functions and customizations you could ever think of, this is your time to jump in on a discontinued body.  You could get a D90 for $300 more, but that will soon be outdated by the D400, and after testing out the D5000, I am sure the next in this semi-pro/pro series will be AWESOME; however, are you willing to pay the premium for new technology?In short,CONS:The D200 isn't usable without a flash above ISO 1000 (maybe 1250)The viewfinder isn't 100%Theere aren't dual CF slotsPROS:At the current prices, this slaughters the D90/D40/D60 series for ability to have ALL controls at hand, infinite customization, exapansive information in the viewfinder, unparalleled weather sealing, and backward compatibility to lenses dating to the 1960's.Looks cooler than the other D90/D40/D60 series in size, weight, grip, and dimensionAll in all, this body will teach you how to be an excellent photographer and show you your flaws faster than the newer non pro-models ever could.Happy shooting!", "Date": "May 6, 2009"}, {"Title": "Great Camera", "Author": "Yi Nan", "ReviewID": "R2IINMKBT94XV1", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I am always a Canon user and buy this one for my father who is Nikon user.

Most camera people already know that if your are a Nikon person: buy Nikon; if you are a Canon person: buy Canon. My quick discussion will not address the alternative choice to choose another camera maker.The D300 is out and so is the D700; yet, Nikon still manufactures and sells the D200. Why would you opt for this camera over the newer models? I cannot lie: There is nothing the D200 can't do that those more expensive and newer cameras can do -- except megapixels (10 vs 12).I will say this once: You Are Shooting RAW aren't you?If yes, then my previous paragraph is succinct enough.If no, then the nuances and menu options and myriad labyrinths of roundabout searching for more control of your shots will have you befuddled in no time on all these cameras. The D90, D80, D70, D60, D50, D40 have scene control modes that might justifiably satisfy all your shooting needs. I personally find the modes on my D50 totally useless and use it in P (program), A (aperture priority mode), or M (manual) mode always. I'd love it if Nikon made an entry level DSLR with these three modes only as an entry level camera without having to fight with all the \"scene sensing modes\" built into the camera.Back to the D200. What I love about this machine is the ease of access to all (at least the main) controls of the camera on dials, toggle switches, and buttons on the camera body, without having to search through arcane menus to edit the controls.

Next, upgrade your glass (using Nikkor lenses for forward compatibility), and take a photo developing and retouching course using digital tools (i.e., photoshop, lightroom, apple aperture, etc.)If you aren't shooting RAW then this camera simply isn't for you.And I would say that about any camera regardless of manufacturer that costs over $600.Good day,--c", "Date": "October 4, 2008"}, {"Title": "Great camera, a little misleading info on Amazon", "Author": "A.

Buying used is always a bit of a risk but from the looks of things this camera has sat in the closet for most of it's life so it appears that my gamble paid off.  Most controls are similar to my D70 and D70s bodies so there wasn't much of a learning curve to get accustomed to the settings.

It felt really nice in my hands and made me feel so much better about buying a camera that is 3 generations old. The way this camera is laid out is absolutely genius. This camera is designed for you to adjust your settings quickly and without going through a menu. Changing your auto focus type is as easy a flipping a switch on the back of the camera. My only regret is that I didn't start off with this camera. The image quality isn't that bad for how old the camera is today, and I prefer the look of this camera's images over the D5100(despite the newer 16MP cmos sensor). I find it renders colors more accurately than the D5100, even though it isn't as clean or sharp as the D5100, and for me that is what the customers are going to see.

I can go over every positive detail this camera features, but I am not going to do that since so many others have.  I have taken well over 10,000 shots with it and it is still going strong and not once have I had an issue with it.  The only time I get a bad shot is due to user error - which does happen sometimes.  I have made prints up to 30\"x40\" and they look beautiful and sharp.  That is partly due to the quality of Nikkor lenses which are just as high performance, refined and durable as the D200.One thing I will say is that I live in Minnesota and it tends to get cold up here...I usually don't consider it `cold' until it hits -20 or below and we have many of those days each winter.  At one time I did own a Canon, only because it was cheaper (go ahead and kick me for it, I did).  Well, they are cheaper and cheaply made - plastic lens mounts on some of their cameras and many of their lenses...come on!  Anyway, on not even cold days, 30 degrees or so, the camera would freeze up and that was with warm batteries.  So it is not a battery issue but the actual camera body that would freeze up.  Canons have so much plastic in them, it makes them lightweight, but not durable and definitely not for cold weather situations, in my opinion and experience they are junk compared to Nikons standards of refinement, durability and quality.I am so happy with performance and durability of my D200 on any day or night and it does work well even on those `cold' days at -20 degrees or less.  It's water resistant, so works well in rain and heavy fog (other times my Canon would fail on me).  And durable; this thing is built like a tank and if anyone ever tries to take it from me, I'll just beat them over the head with it, than take a picture to prove it!This is a beautiful piece of equipment and I will never go back to using cheap Canons or any other brand name for that matter.

For me, the MOST important and hardest to get photos are usually the indoor ones (ie weddings or events). So I decided to spent a bit more on camera equipment to fulfill that requirement. Having absolutely little knowledge of SLR cameras (dont get intimidated by this), you should know that there is a Program mode where you can use this as a point and shoot camera. As you get used to it, you migrate more to the manual mode and take advantage of the unique capabilities of this camera.First, Nikon lenses are great! The pictures are clear and with VR, it really helps eliminate some blurred images from shaky hands. As you proceed to no-flash indoor photography, VR helps a lot (up to only a certain shutter speed before you need a tripod). Having a 18-200mm lens covers most of your everyday needs. For me, I bought a few other lenses to play with... It will become costly but the pictures are priceless. Paying extra for VR is well worth it. When you look for other lenses, you will see the price difference with or without VR. I REALLY would recommended spending the extra on VR especially when you are zooming in..Second, the camera is VERY sturdy and quite heavy. So this is obviously not the most portable camera around. It is an SLR so what do you expect?Finally, four months after my D200 purchase, I have absolutely no regret of spending over 2300$ on this. So if you are new to SLR cams and debating whether to buy this or not AND portability is not an issue, I highly recommend that you go for it.

The controls on the camera are right at your fingertips, and easy to get to quickly.  The color images produced by this camera are incredible.  If you're in the market for a second camera body, as I was, or simply want a well built, reliable start-up DSLR camera, don't hesitate, get the D200.  I think you'll be pleasantly surprised.  That being said, I have to say that the seller, ubee67 was incredible to deal with.  The camera came exactly as described (with original box, CD, manual, battery & charger).  They even threw in free expedited shipping, allowing me to get my D200 even sooner.

Optically it is definitely the most versatile digital SLR currently available, since it will allow Nikon users to use most of their manual Nikkor lenses, and superb third party lenses made by Sigma, Tamron and Tokina. Therefore it will allow Nikon users the splendid opportunity of using the new ZF Zeiss lenses which are slowly being introduced by Zeiss and Cosina, most notably the new 50mm f1.4 Carl Zeiss Planar which is said to be a major improvement over the still excellent Contax 50mm f1.4 Carl Zeiss Planar. So potential users of this camera have now the best of both worlds, using both current AF Nikkor lenses and superb third party autofocusing zooms and other lenses made by Sigma, Tamron and Tokina, and such great manual focusing Nikkor lenses as the venerable 105mm f2.5 Nikkor and 35mm f1.4 Nikkor lenses and of course the new ZF Carl Zeiss lenses which are being made in Japan by Cosina under strict Zeiss quality control.The Nikon D200 builds on the D2X with regards to versatility for digital photography, and then adds some more, offering richer colors than its previous top-of-the-line digital SLR. I've been impressed with excellent reports I've heard about this camera's relative ease in handling, even under the worst weather conditions. So the Nikon D200 will appeal to many professional photographers because of its ruggedness. Without a doubt, Nikon has made a genuine winner which should allow it to retain not only its loyal following of professional and amateur photographers, but also attract others.

After a few months fiddling around with my D5100, I took the leap backwards and got the 10 megapixel D200. I am NOT regretting this decision at all. I am very happy with the pro-grade body and the plethora of settings and buttons on the D200 body. The weight, feel, button layout, even down to the nostaglic analog button pressing feel is an experience to behold.For everyone else (probably looking for a cheaper but capable DSLR), the D200 is just perfect for a fuller experience capturing images. 10 MP is still more than enough detail and resolution for uploading to your (insert social network website), flickr, etc. For larger prints, the 10 mp might not be sufficient enough (especially at higher iso). I bought this camera because I was seeking that rugged pro-grade body. If some of you have not already noticed, there is the holy grail of white balance, iso, and qual (file type - raw, jpeg) on top of the left dial of the D200. The prosumer D90, D7000, and D7100 do not have that. Full frame bodies and the D300 & D300s also have the holy grail trio of button too. To me, that was one of the deciding factors. To others, it might not even matter.The LCD screen is 2.5 inches and really isn't that great for viewing. There is no live view and there is no video mode. Okay, let's have some moments of tears. Time to move on.The D200 is heavy, rugged (weather-sealed), and is full of buttons that are useful. No need to scour through your menu. It's all there for you.The LCD screen can also be turned on/off and has a green LED light. When the camera is off, there is a number that shows you how many shots you have left on your memory card. That number is always visible.I love the placement of the aperture dial (right front index finger) and the shutter dial (right back thumb). Zooming and viewing your pictures isn't the easiest and most convenient, but it's tolerable. Just a couple more button presses.The D200 isthe camera to get if you are seeking that pro-grade body and a still relevant sensor. With the age of the D200 and the 10 MP sensor, this is most suited for high quality photographs but limited to uploading to websites and small prints.

Crawford \"The Constant Amatuer\"", "ReviewID": "R3TX6SI6DD8E2G", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I think the point a lot of people are not mentioning about the d200 is quite obvious.  Let me be the first to say that the main reason I bought the d200 over the d80 was to increase my credibility and prestige as an amateur photographer, make other photographers jealous of my kit, and to brag about the obscene amount of money I spend on camera equipment while my co-workers can't even pay their rent.  I bought the grip because I thought it looked really cool, and it increased the size and visibility of my camera to other people.  The question that really sold me on the d200 was: will strangers that I might want to photograph be more likely to say yes standing on the other side of a d80 or a d200?  Will people have less doubts about me holding this thing opposed to a smaller model?  Which one looks cooler?If I was completely loaded would I buy the D2Xs? Without a second thought.Of course I talked to a lot of camera people making minimum wage hoping that they would have some technical insight about purchasing a Nikon or other camera.  Of course they let me down and said a lot of bogus things to me most saying something like: \"the d200 is way to much camera for me.\"  None of them knew how to change the exposure settings, they were contented with the wheel and \"child mode,\" on top of the d80 and recited this to me several times as if I looked like a soccer mom.  As usual I was offended by the human experience of buying in the real world, especially the atrocious mark up of several hundred dollars, I refused to help pay those employees wages.  The breaking point I think was the time an associate instructed me to buy one camera over the other because, \"when she dropped this camera it broke and the other one didn't.\"  So I turned to the internet where I only have to say hi to the UPS man as he leaves.I studied and studied all things technical, sometimes just staring at pictures of cameras for long periods of time without blinking.  I poured over thousands of photographs taken by all kinds of cameras and amassed a photographic library while I decided.  Basically I went way overboard and let the decision of buying a camera engulf my life until I was dreaming about it.So one night I just bought the d200 after being on the fence over the d80 or the d200.  And after two days it arrived and I was impressed with it.  The thing is literally a cold hard photographic machine.After being broken in on the d50 I was firstly impressed with the size, and then secondly all of the dials and switches to change things that I used to have to dig through the menu to get to.  Thirdly I liked the blazing fast 2 frame rate.When I go out at night I snap the 50mm f/1.8 onto it and crank the iso up.  A lot of people in the forms were complaining about the noise in the high iso of the d200 but I thought it was fine.  I feel most people from that camp want perfect clarity all the way up into the highest isos but I think that is artistically limiting.  I read one scathing review written by a veteran film user saying that basically high iso in digital has a lot less graininess than film basically saying that the d200 is a step up but some people still want to complain.  As far as the d200 goes versus the d50 at iso 1600 it is leaps and bounds better in my opinion.  The noise is way reduced without NR and there isn't that pixel chunkiness I found in the d50 at high isos.Another thing that stands out on the d200 is the enhanced colors.  In reality the ultra vivid setting on the d200 makes a lot of things look sort of fake, but it does make people who don't have a sun tan look like they have one which is a plus in my opinion.  It can make your dull green lawn look like a lush paradise, skies are ultra blue, and reds are spectacular.  I remember when I used the d50 I would steer away from photographing violets and red roses because it would blow them out, not so with the d200.  For some reason coming from point and shoot it always used to annoy my that the d50 didn't have b&w; or sepia.  The d200 has b&w; but no sepia.  The nerds in the forums would just say, \"use cs2, or a photo editor,\" but I say no because I should be able to do everything in camera.The viewfinder is so awesome.  I literally hated electronic viewfinders and the d50's viewfinder was so small that it hindered my framing at times.  The d200 has a big bright viewfinder and a huge lcd that sucks down batteries like nothing.  As far as my evolution goes in photography sometimes I feel like I can literally climb into the viewfinder because its so big compared to what I was used to.Like I said the grip is awesome and I really like it.  I kind of like having as many accessories as possible and that kind of steered me away from the D2Xs into the d200.  Watching the percentage marks count down as the batteries drain is always fun.  The best thing about the d200 is little things like that because they make me feel like I have greater control over my pictures because I know exactly how many I can take.In conclusion buy the d200 over the d80 I am really happy with it and I am not happy with anything.  If you're having trouble considering what you want photographically try and pull yourself away from forums and outside sources and really consider what got you into photography in the first place and where you intend to go with it, I think that is the important part.

They lose sight of the things that really matter in photography: the exposure, the focusing, the colours, the contrast, the lighting -- all things that the D200 does extremely well. In addition, the D200 is very solidly built and handles very much like a Nikon film camera from the 90's.About the only negatives I can think of for this camera are the lack of a split-image focusing screen and the fact that only the newest Nikon-compatible flashes will work with TTL metering. Also, the provided software is minimal, and you will definitely need at least a mid-range RAW conversion tool like Nikon Capture or Bibble Pro. Nikon's philosophy with the D200 is one of \"do no harm\", so the images tend to be under-processed straight out of the camera. But you can still get fantastic jpegs if you adjust the saturation, contrast, sharpening and noise reduction to your own tastes.Other cameras in this class include the Canon EOS 30D, Panasonic DMC-L1 and the Sigma SD14. Unless you have already bought into one of the other systems, the D200 probably offers the best value for the money. It has no major weaknesses and the build quality, ergonomics, metering and compatibility with existing lenses are all a notch above the others. It is the camera that you are least likely to want to replace in the foreseeable future.", "Date": "April 16, 2007"}, {"Title": "I love this camera", "Author": "Lioness Laura", "ReviewID": "R68JZNRWAMVDB", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "My advice is to buy an extra battery and a 2MB memory card.

But I'm wrong. It seems this camera has retained its value, which along with the fact that I think it works well, makes me feel I made the right choice.  One thing to consider is that the 'feel' of a camera in your hand is important for photo-taking and you really should try out a few cameras in 'real life' before ordering one on the internet. This one, with its sturdy infrastructure, is very comfortable and has the heft that makes using it a pleasure. I also have an N40, which is also a good camera, but it is much lighter in weight, and one that I feel must be handled very carefully--which makes me very cautious when using it. The fact this camera has kept its value makes me wonder. Why are the newer models toted as having so many 'advanced new' features? Well, maybe the chief improvement is that the D200 has a high noise factor at any ISO over 200; solution use a noise reduction software. If you use noise reduction anyway, this shouldn't be much of a hassle. But if you check out the newer Nikons, consider the price.

Skurat", "ReviewID": "R3393XHAP396K1", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I posted one review regarding this camera in which I gave the camera two stars because of its tendency to consistently underexpose full green auto mode flash photos.  However, after 3 emails to Nikon's tech support, I've changed my mind.  First of all, please allow me to say that Nikon's tech support is top notch.  Technician David D was great.  He was very patient with me, an amateur photographer when it comes to digital SLRs, and he explained things in a way I could understand completely.If you are a snapshot photographer who wants a nice camera to be able to point and shoot without worrying about attempting to create perfect photographs by fussing with settings, quite frankly, the Nikon D80 isn't the camera you want.  Get yourself a quality point and shoot camera that will take acceptable snapshots.  If, on the other hand, your goal is to create beautiful, near professional quality digital photographs by adjusting and tweaking camera settings, then this camera is an excellent camera for you.  The features that this camera comes loaded down with gives you such tremendous control that, if you take the time to learn this camera, you will be able to take detail perfect photographs that will make you proud, along with being glad that you bought a Nikon D80 camera.The camera does indeed underexpose flash photos taken in the full auto mode so that they appear dark.  However, Nikon has set up its metering system to do this for a reason, as Nikon's technician, David D explained to me.  The D80 automatically assumes that you, the photographer, will, most likely, desire to edit the photos you take, in some form or fashion.  Nikon was very perceptive about digital photographers to figure things this way, actually.  Even with point and shoot photographers, including myself, whenever photos are uploaded from digital cameras to computers, most of those photos are cropped, enhanced, red eye eliminated, etc.  In a slightly underexposed digital photograph, all the data and detail is there.  That photograph can then be edited, if you so desire, and, since you started with a photo that contained all its data and detail, you can produce a great picture.  However, an overexposed digital photograph will lose data and detail.  The data and detail lost in an overexposed digital photograph can't be restored by any amount of editing.  The D80 will give you a slightly underexposed photograph out of the camera so that you will have all the data and detail in that photograph, as opposed to a slightly overexposed photo with lost data and detail.  You can then edit that slightly underexposed photo, if you desire to do so, and you will have a photo with all its data and detail to work with.  This can't be said for a slightly overexposed digital photograph, which will have lost some data and detail.Nikon technician David D suggested to me that if I didn't mind losing a bit of the data and detail in my photographs, that I could either do some photo editing with photo editing software and brighten them up, or, using the D80's exposure compensation feature, I could set the camera to add a little exposure to each photograph it takes.If you're going to use a Nikon D80 camera, you have to think more like a photographer than like a tourist taking vacation photos.
