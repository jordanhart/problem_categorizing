Spinella \"DaculaDom\"", "ReviewID": "R21Y7QCH6TTGNC", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Although this camera has a few quirks, after a brief introductory period and the purchase of an SD card, my wife loves it.Why I bought it: This camera was a gift for my wife who has a very nice camera (a Sony about a half-step below a professional camera) which she uses most of the time.  She wanted something small that she could stick in her pocket for those spur of the moment occasions that crop up at children's school parties and such.  This camera fits the bill.It easily fits into her pocket (either shirt or jeans), takes high quality photos, has numerous optional settings, and with an 8 GB SD card has room for over 2000 photos at the highest quality settings.  It takes AA batteries, so there is no \"I forgot to charge the camera\" issues.Quirks:1) The first quirk is the way the camera reacts when its memory is full.  This is simple to do if you don't buy an SD card immediately.  The camera defaults to the highest MP setting (12) which allows about four or five photos on the camera memory.  Then the camera displays a message saying that the memory is full.  Ours also seemed to have a hiccup the first time it happened and we had to turn it off and turn it back on using the play button on the back of the camera.  After this, the camera was fine.2) The batteries.  This camera uses AAs.  I have heard arguments against this, but my wife and I prefer this feature.  Our reasoning is simple: if the batteries run out, almost every store on the planet carries AAs.  We can walk into any of them and buy more.  You can't say the same if you forget or use all of a proprietary battery that is unique to a specific camera.  For the eco-conscious, you can still use rechargeable batteries, they are just going to be rechargeable AAs.3) Snap-time.  I don't even know if that's a term, but it describes the issue fairly well.  This camera takes a while to capture the photo.  While this is a bit annoying, the wait seems in line with most of our friends' and families' cameras.  I have only witnessed one camera not have this issue and I know for a fact that one cost over $3,000 (i.e. a bit out of our budget.)NOTE: There may be a setting that changes this that we have not found yet.Overall: we have had a very good experience so far with the camera.  We are extremely hopeful that this will continue.", "Date": "December 21, 2010"}, {"Title": "Great pictures, but not reliable", "Author": "Truth Seeker", "ReviewID": "R2PNGJNMTC21JN", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "After reading mixed reviews, we chose to order this camera due to the low price and seemingly comparable quality to other 12mp cameras.  After receiving it very promptly, it worked well for the first 2 days, as others mentioned and then decided to suddenly turn off with the lens stuck out.  We tried changing the batteries and pushing the power button several times, but nothing worked.  We set it down and hours later, the lens had retracted and it worked again.  I told my daughter if it happened again we would return it.  Within 12 hours it did exactly the same thing with the lens again stuck in an out position and no buttons would work. All of this is very sad because the picture quality is excellent.  We were at my brother-in-law's wedding and lost a lot of shots because of the lack of dependability.Hopefully Polaroid will address this issue, because if it weren't for the camera shutting down, I would highly recommend it!  It isn't happening to everyone who buys it, since some of the reviews don't mention it, but enough that it is cause for concern...Regarding the return, it was very simple and Amazon is paying the return shipping.

I had read the reviews posted prior to purchase and wanted a backup to my two smartphone cameras (IPhone and IPod) for use when traveling. I installed the batteries with the camera and began taking some test shots. No sooner than my 4th or 5th shot, the camera stopped working. After replacing the batteries and installing an SD card, I tried again and the camera worked perfectly. Clearly, any buyer should begin use with a memory card (of any capacity) to allow for adequate storage and with fresh batteries.The test pictures were printed using your basic (CVS) service and even with enlargement, I was moderately impressed with the quality of the print.So the two steps a new user should follow are:  1. replace the batteries included with the camera with fresh high capacity batteries and  2. use a memory card immediately before use.", "Date": "January 8, 2011"}, {"Title": "Awesome little camera!", "Author": "tearstainedrose", "ReviewID": "R3GSP4TV9IG934", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I bought this camera mainly to take pictures of my daughter.

The first few times I pressed the power button it would not turn on. After finally getting it to come on I tried taking pictures with it, during the first shot the camera cut off and I couldnt get it to come back on. The camera comes with 2AA duracell ultra batteries and the display showed that it was full when I got it to come back on. I wished I hadnt desired to save money since at the time there was another camera on sale for about twenty more bucks. I had found another of these when searching similar items that is about the same price but after checking targets(the seller) website for reviews I found one in which a reviewer had the exact same problem I am having and theirs ended up with the lens stuck out and useless after only one week, until I read that I had considered giving this one until my birthday at the beginning of the year to act right before returning it. I still may try the one from the different seller since maybe its possible I happened to buy one of the defective ones, fingers crossed because I have the pogo and thought another poloroid product would be the best paired with it. Finally got my 5 pics off the camera and I must say it does take excellent pics which is why I gave 2stars Switching to record mode for the first time is a bit tedious but once you have done it once you can press the scene button which brings up a mini menu where you can choose recent settings and it will be in that menu.

I mentioned this because after reading the reviews here I was a little hesitant but the price was too good to resist and decided that it was worth the risk. In the end I figured if the camera didn't work then I would at least still have a nice little photo printer.I would like to address that I didn't have the lens problem that other reviewers had mentioned of. That's not to say that the problem does not or couldn't exist. To be on the safe side I registered my products right away with polaroid.And after browsing through the manual I am pleased to find out that there is options to shoot video as well as take pictures in hd quality. 16:9 aspect ratio to be more specific. I have not tried it but it's nice to know that it's there. I can however say that the settings and adjustments are there for anyone who is willing to take the time to go through the manual to get a handle on the features. And yes they do make a difference as I noticed just by taking three of the same pictures in my room but under different settings.In all I would say that this camera has enough features to rival if not beat the other mass marketed digital cameras that you would find at costco, walmart, target etc. Don't be discouraged by the so called lens problem that the other reviewers have stated had happened.

It is my first digital camera. It was sent to me as a gift, purchased at Amazon.Because of its lackluster customer reviews, I probably wouldn't have selected this camera myself, and would have missed out.The features I've found most useful:Very good user manual. Because this was my first digital camera, I studied it for several hours. There are many settings options. I found that they became intuitive surprisingly quickly, and they're organized into a menu structure that also became intuitive with a surprisingly short amount of practice.It uses standard rechargeable NiMH AA batteries, not a proprietary battery pack.Tripod mount. I use a tripod whenever possible, and am getting amazingly sharp crisp pictures with very good color.Large bright LCD display with intuitive readable layout that can be set to show all the important settings currently in effect while composing a shot.The flash is very bright and is wide-field, so I've had no problems with insufficient coverage of the area in a shot.Configurable sounds.The Programmed exposure mode (P) works well for most conditions. (I was less satisfied with the completely automatic AUTO (A) exposure mode.)Macro focus works well.There is a Manual (M) override for the exposure settings, which I've found interesting and useful.The center-weighted light metering mode is very good.Auto-Focus works very well. I have its mode set to Wide.Depth of field is surprisingly good under all conditions so far, even though the camera's aperture range seems quite narrow compared to SLR film cameras. Maybe that's normal for digital cameras.Using only the internal memory (no separate memory card) and with JPEG compression set to Normal, I'm getting about 28 photos at 3 megapixel size before memory is full. It says it holds about 9 12-megapixel photos, or 118 640x480 photos, but I haven't tested those settings.Battery \"problems\"The camera came with two Duracell Ultra alkaline batteries dated 2016, 4 years in the future. I put them in the camera, turned it on, set the date and time, pressed OK, and that's as far as I got. The camera turned itself off because it thought the batteries were exhausted.It appears to me that you simply cannot use alkaline batteries in this camera (in spite of their being provided in the package), even if you set the battery mode to Alkaline. They cannot deliver the current surges required by this (or probably any) digital camera.For a couple of days, I used some Energizer NiMH AA's that I had, but only got about 9 flash photos per charge because they were old.With new Duracell 2450 mAh NiMH rechargeable batteries, I've got at least 100 photos so far (most of them with flash) on a single charge and haven't exhausted the batteries yet.Moral of the story: if you don't have high capacity NiMH rechargeable AA batteries and a charger, get those items at the same time that you purchase this camera. You'll need them.I thought I should mention that because some of the customer review complaints have been about an apparently dead camera, and I have to wonder if the batteries might have been the real problem, considering that the only thing I was able to accomplish with the provided batteries was set the date and time.When I searched Amazon to see what other camera I might have chosen for myself instead of this one, I couldn't find anything I would be confident about liking better than this one, especially at anywhere near the price of this one.", "Date": "January 22, 2012"}, {"Title": "Sadly disappointed", "Author": "sayit", "ReviewID": "R12IZHDTNGOZU5", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "This canera takes one picture and then quits working.

Once it arrived, I played with it for 10 minutes or so, and soon realized the problem that everyone else was having... it wouldn't turn on.  This particular camera I knew was a problem, because I never did end up getting it back on.  So I returned it and order another one (this time from a different seller hoping that things might be different).  It was no use.Once my second one arrived, it had the same issue, but was a tiny bit more reliable.  I could get it on if I played with it for a few minutes, pushing the button ever so carefully and differently.  Variety was no solution.  When I needed it, it was not available, so I called Polaroid.  Of course they wouldn't admit fault, but this is a bad model number.  So I returned my second one.In the end, after all this time had passed, the best value on the market (excluding this crappy camera) was a Kodak EasyShare C183 Black 14MP Digital Camera w/ 3x Optical Zoom for $59 at Walmart Online.  I went for it.  Not only does the 14MP camera work better, it has more features and is many, many times better overall.Bottom Line:Don't waste your time.

We took it on a vacation and the camera worked well.  We did not encounter any issues related to the battery and the pictures came out OK for a point and shoot. Fast forward two months (the camera had been placed back in the box and rested on a shelf.  We were packing to go to a family function and my daughter excitedly grabbed her camera, turned it on to test the batteries and it would not turn on.  No problem, we have new batteries.  With brand new batteries the camera will no initialize.  The initial power on results in the lens cover opening briefly and then three beeps and it shuts off.  I think there may be an issue with the gears for the lens assembly binding up.  It is still under warranty so, I will look for a repair center however, I do not believe there is one in driving range.

My old one, aNorcent DCC-725 7.0MP Digital Camera with 3x Optical Zoom, had finally kicked the bucket, and with a new baby, pictures are a way of life. I tend to by off brand with cameras, and though I've never had a problem with them, I decided to go with Polaroid this time based on price and the fact that they were Polaroid. I figured that as good as my cheap Norcent was, a dedicated camera brand with a lot of history would be even better.How wrong I was. It worked well for about a week; then it started giving me issues turning on. It was still turning on, I just had to hit the power button three or four times to do so.I figured the problem might be the batteries, so on the way to my son's first carnival, we stopped and picked up a set of batteries for it; a set of Energizers, and the ones specifically meant for electronics (also a brand I've used extensively, they work phenomenally).We got to the carnival and I was able to take two pictures. After that it refused to come on for the rest of the evening. I was really upset that it chose to stop working when it did; I had no ability to just go pick up an alternative where I was, and I shouldn't have had to.Over all the picture quality is really good, but there is something wrong mechanically with these cameras.

I've made 9-10 shots and turned it off to remove SDHC card. Moved pics to computer, quality was decent, then I put card back in the camera and pushed power button. No response! At all! It's dead!!!Do NOT buy this junk!!!Part 2. The next day experience.I'm really confused. The next day I've decided to try my luck and pushed power button and the camera turned on. Since then it works just fine. I tried to reproduce the problem and here are my observation: Do not push ANY (I mean ANY) button while it is connected to the PC via USB cable. It went dead every time I did so. Actually 3 times, then I stopped to tempt my luck.Other than that it works just nice and smoothly. No problem with turning it on/off. The picture quality is great, it's easy to operate and has got many, many settings to play with.Overall, excellent family camera, especially considering the price.Would I recommend it to anyone? Hmmmm, I guess so. But taking other reviews into consideration, it seems like some kind of gamble, though.p.s. Changing rating from 1 star to 4 stars.UPDATE: After 6 months of heavy abuse from 12 years old kid the camera still works fine.", "Date": "January 18, 2011"}, {"Title": "Total garbage", "Author": "OHGREATONE2", "ReviewID": "RECN8JUFT8MUF", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I HAD THIS CAMERA FOR ABOUT A MONTH AND IT TOOK VERY CLEAR PHOTO'S HOWEVER ON THE NIGHTI NEEDED IT THE MOST THE SCREEN WAS BLACK, AND THE DARN THING WOULD NOT WORK, AND IT NOW LIES IN MYGARBAGE CAN WHERE IT BELONGS.", "Date": "October 9, 2011"}, {"Title": "DOA", "Author": "Joe W.

I looked around and checked out a few cameras here, compared a few and thought that for the price this one wouldn't be to bad. Once I got it though and took it out of the box I noticed how cheap and light it seemed. Thinking it'll do, I installed the batteries that came with it and tried to get it on. I tried to take a few pics of my son, it only holds 4 pics so luckiliy I had a sim card. It froze numourous times. Nothing I did would get it going again. I'd take a pic and the camera wouldn't flash or do anything. I tried to take the batteries out to see if I can restart it, but if stayed open but not on. I tried new batteries and that didn't work. I was pretty upset. My son is almost 2 and has had 3 surgeries. I want pictures of him as a baby/toddler so I can show my family who lives far way. Plus have memories. I was at Walmart shortly after getting this camera and found a similar one for 49$.", "Date": "February 20, 2011"}, {"Title": "terrible and very dissapointing, im disgusted at polaroid, shame on you", "Author": "lily", "ReviewID": "R4B8QKKNTYLXB", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "i cant believe this piece of crap, i thought it would be of excellent quality because of the name brand polaroid. they need to take this camera off the market. when i opened the box the package was cut through the middle in an angle. the camera was not damaged so i decided to open it and possibly keep it. yeah right. i think the camera came on the first day, my son tell me lol. im so upset i dont even remember, then i shut the camera off cause we had to leave the house for a while. the next few days i decided to check the camera out some more and the stupid dum camera came on then shut off while i was taking pictures, lol. i tried cutting it back on, it did not come on, i pressed the button over and over again continuously, it still did not come on. so i gave the dam thing a break, it still didnt come on, im like what the hell is going on, this is a new name brand camera, why the power button shuts off while youre taking a few pictures? why does the lens in the front of the camera get stuck when the camera shuts off. so basically, the lens is just sticking out, when it should go back in when the camera shuts off. the lens also go in on its on without u doing it yourself.  why does it come back on in like a half hour or more hours, when it shouldnt go off in the first place, and it should come on anytime u want it on. the battery was also full, this is the batteries that came with the camera,  duracell ultra. lol this camera is a scam and do no not waist your money on this crap, im happy i did not have this crap when the lunar eclipse happened, you cant depend on this camera, it would have dissapointed me on the lunar eclipse day.  this was not my first choice of cameras, i ordered another camera before this,  a purple fuji, but the camera looked used and was missing a usb cord, so i sent it back and got refunded, and used my refund money to purchase this crappy polaroid camera. i am happy that other people made comments about polaroid errors, when i read your comments i was laughing because i couldnt believe i wasnt the only one experiencing this. the same problems other people have with this camera i am going through this now. i am sending this boot leg piece of polaroid crap back and want all my money back lol. shame on u polaroid. i should have got a cheap unknown digital camera, and i just might do that lol. so no more polaroid no more fuji. dam scam.", "Date": "January 17, 2011"}, {"Title": "I HATE THIS CAMERA", "Author": "Ashley Harmon", "ReviewID": "R14044KLZ7899L", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "Honestly, just save your money.
