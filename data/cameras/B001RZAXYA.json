I installed it under the eve. So far we are satisfied with it. It out performs my other cameras, especially in low light conditions. It does see further at night. and in color longer at night than the cameras I have. These cameras have 28 LED infrared bulbs and light up dark areas very well. If you need more dark/nighttime illumination, get a camera with more LED bulbs in the camera or a separate LED infrared illuminator.", "Date": "March 1, 2011"}, {"Title": "Good, but missing controls for adjusting picture/OSD", "Author": "Tom Servo", "ReviewID": "RO6AH5COIDYBY", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "For those that don't know Sony's Effio chipset has adjustable on-screen (OSD) controls for adjusting picture details as well as special functions (privacy mask, lens iris adjustments, adjusting day/night trip point, turning Wide Dynamic Range on/off etc). This camera might indeed use the Effio chipset but does NOT have the controls molded into the cable as other Effio cams do. Therefore you are limited to whatever \"defaults\" the manufacturer programmed (and there's no way of knowing what these are).THE GOOD:+ Attractive, lightweight (due to black plastic case).+ Lots of IR LEDs for night vision.+ Comes with power supply.THE BAD:- Not fully adjustable as other Effio cams for the reason pointed out above.- This is not a varifocal cam, you cannot adjust lens to match your desired view - it's a fixed 3.6mm (wide angle) lens.- The seller has used the same amazon product ASIN for different products at different points in time. Therefore the older reviews may not match the current \"Effio\" product - something to be aware of!OVERALL, I would recommend Professional 1/3\" Sony Exview HAD CCD II with Effio-E DSP Devices Dome Indoor Security Camera - 700 TV lines, 2.8~12mm varifocal lens, 36pcs IR LED, 98 feet IR Distance.

If you are buying a power supply box for all your cameras, keep that in mind.Out of the 4 different camera's I have in my setup, I would rate this one at the top in no light situations.

Only 1 out of a dozen or so that I bought had to be sent back.I am looking at the picture from this camera (videosecu $80.00 800tvl) in quadrant one of my 32\" (inches) tv. In quad 2 is a the 600 line model ($60.00 also from videosecu). The difference is noticeable but not huge: there is slightly more detail and better nite vision sensitivity in the 800tvl model.It is nightime and the picture is now B&W;, but I can clearly see the street and my car parked in front of the house. I can't read license plates or id faces in the street, but I can (with two cameras mounted on the 2nd floor) see up and down the street. These are wide-angle (not too wide) which provides better coverage.Last week a guy drove up to the house in the afternoon (with 4 cameras in plain view) in a rented Penske van and told the downstairs neighbor that he was from the electic company and needed access to the basement. PSE&G; of NJ says they don't use rented trucks.  My neighbor wouldn't let him in and when she tried to get his plate he quickly drove away. So don't expect that all criminals will be scared away. While at the front door the porch cam got a fair, not great recording of him. It's difficult because criminals don't stop look up at the camera and hold still for that great ID shot.It's tough to get good coverage all over your property. My brother live in a bad neighborhood.  I got him an 8 channel DVR and 7 cameras: backyard, frontyard, frondoor, porch, driveway, garage, sidedoor. You can never have enough it seems.There are no adjustments on this camera.  With the siamese cable (sold seperately) and power supply (included)  you can plug it direct to your tv (if you have a BNC->RCA adaptor (sold seperately $2-4.00) if your tv has an RCA input jack.  But you really want a 8 Channel DVR. If you buy a 4 channel DVR, you'll probably end up wishing you got the 8 chnl DVR.Forget about having any privacy in public. Those times are gone. Cameras are coming everwhere. Have them on your house and find out what really happens.  Oh did i mention that my next door neighbor with the 4 kids who is always so friendly steals anything not nailed down! Now he stays off my property: mostly.Running the wirea is the big pain: not hard, just takes time. You can even run them into the house through a window though it's Better to drill a hole, say where the cable tv comes in.Mike K", "Date": "October 26, 2012"}, {"Title": "Horrible", "Author": "TreyJ", "ReviewID": "R6NOJK06ZRSW6", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "Ordered two, Sent one back immediately after tying to mount the other camera. mounting was a pain. left the first one mounted and within 2 weeks it was full of condensation.", "Date": "September 26, 2012"}, {"Title": "Product is okay.", "Author": "Frederick Scott", "ReviewID": "R4RBGG1I9AQM", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "Do not expect too much from this product.
