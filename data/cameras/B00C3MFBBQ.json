It let's you take photos while your video taping an event.When you do this, it does use up a lot of battery power, so always have a backup battery power up.This is not the regular AA or AAA battery that it uses. Its a square battery. When you turn off the camera, the GPS is still tracking its location, it is an option can be turned off. Not exactly sure where the GPS tracking is attached in the photo.There are lot of stuffs that came in the bundle.", "Date": "December 3, 2013"}, {"Title": "great camera and shipping", "Author": "married with children", "ReviewID": "RTAUS2R2XA6O8", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "the camera is great!  did lots of shots in the pool day and night, took to cancun, playa del carmen and tulum.  used in the ocean, on ziplines, atv's and from mayan ruins.  every pic was a keeper.  sssoooo many different settings and fun color options.  this seller shipped lightning fast and the extras were everything and more to help you capture those memories.", "Date": "July 28, 2013"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": null, "Features": null, "Name": null, "ImgURL": null, "ProductID": "B00C3MFBBQ"}}
