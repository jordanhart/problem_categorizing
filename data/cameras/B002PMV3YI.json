{"Reviews": [{"Title": "not a great camera", "Author": "jb8677", "ReviewID": "RXNA13BJU8941", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I bought this camera from qvc. It was a today special value for around $130. I was looking for a camera with a good optical zoom since most of the cameras sold in store are usually 3x. When I recieved the camera I was content with my perchase. I thought it was weird that instead of a regular sized xd card it came with a macro xd card which would fit into an xd adapter. A month or two after using the camera with no real problems, I stopped into a Target store to print out some pictures. When I attempted  to put the adapter card into the slot to view and pick out pictures, it wouldnt fit. I went home and tried to put the card into my laptop... it wouldnt fit. The adapter card does not fit into anything else except this camera. I called olympus to see if I just had a deformed adapter. The women told me that no, this was how the card was made. When I asked her if many other people had called about this problem she told me that yes, they have gotten calls for the same problem and the best they could do is send me a new adapter, which is the same as the old one, and won't fit into anything other than this camera. I understand that there are ways to print out pictures from the computer and order them from online photo sites, however, this is the most bisarre thing I have heard. I have always been able to print out pictures from stores like target and walmart and prefer to print out pictures that way. If I had known of this \"feature\" in the beginning I would have sent the camera back right away. After using the camera more after this incident I became more frustrated with my perchase. The zoom, which is why I bought the camera in the first place, is very blurry. Also, when the batteries die in this camera, there is no \"low battery\" warning. The camera shuts off. With no warning. When I went onto qvcs website to put on a review, the page for this camera had been taken down. Obviously other customers were not happy with their purchase and the camera was taken off the website. I gues its true that you get what you pay for. I will not be purchasing another olympus camera!", "Date": "January 9, 2010"}, {"Title": "Great Value.", "Author": "Am", "ReviewID": "R136YZYA1HPTJ1", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Just purchased this camera at the local Toys R Us. I did have the FE-3010 model, but wanted the additional zoom this model offers. I'm not sure how great battery life is, but I will be sure to invest in rechargables! I am very pleased with the ease of use and navigating the different photo modes. This camera is perfect for throwing in your purse to take along wherever.**I would like to clear up something I saw in other reviews. With any camera, when you push the zoom past the Optical zoom (using the Digital Zoom), the pictures will appear \"grainy\" (pixely) no matter what the megapixels of the camera are. So for taking pictures with just the Optical zoom, this camera produces clear images.***And for those who've complained about the xd card, this camera includes an xd adapter that will fit a micro-SD card. Most micro-SD cards include an SD adapter when you purchase them. Yes, this leads to having to juggle to different adapters, but for the quality of the Olympus brand and the ease of photo-printing and card-reading, its a great compromise.", "Date": "February 9, 2010"}, {"Title": "So, Bob, how do we sell this thing?", "Author": "Michael", "ReviewID": "R3UV2E131PN37O", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "There I was sitting in the office trying to think about how we were going to sell these Olympus FE-46 cameras. I mean they're a nice camera for the price and all, but there isn't much to make it really stand out in the low end of cameras.So I went down to Bob's office--that guy in marketing who does a pretty good job selling out stuff. I said, \"Hey Bob, how do we sell these things?\" He asked me which one this one was. I replied, \"It's the under $100 one all the nice features.\"He replied, \"oh, the one we make the customer either buy xd memory or more expensive micro-sd cards for?\"\"yeah, but it has 12mp and a cool 5x optical zoom\", I retorted.\"Well if you could take decent pictures at any other time than high noon in a land where time stands still, those would be nice features\", he snorted.Now I think he was making fun of the fact that it's easy to get blurry grainy pictures from the camera, but you're not going to get optical image stabilization or a really good lense at this price (yeah, you get digital image stabilization, but don't let that fool you).I tried to think of a come back, but before I could he continued: \"There's just nothing to make it stand out in a crowd. The features don't sound any different than anyone else. And it looks right out of 1995--and for me, 1995 wasn't a year I want memories from.\"Frustrated, I resorted to name-calling, \"Ok, Mr. Smarty-Pants, how do we sell this thing then???\"He answered, \"It's all about perceived value. Let's throw in a storage box that costs us all of a dollar. Then we'll throw in a case, which (with the current slave labor conversion factor) also costs us about a dollar.\"\"Hmm,\" I said, \"That doesn't sound bad, but why would you buy a box with a camera?\"\"It doesn't matter,\" he answered, \"They add perceived value. In fact, let's throw in a box of crayons and 6 months of free coloring book prints!\"I got a little scared as I saw costs addings up. \"Slow down buddy, can we really afford to include that?\", I asked.\"Don't worry,\" he replied. \"The prints are ones you print on your computer. Not only that, but they normally come free with a 64 pack of crayons!!! It's perceived value at its best! And your camera will come up when people search for 64 crayons.\"Wow, that Bob in marketing is either a genius, or an idiot. But, I'll try anything once. So here's your camera, box, case, and crayons. It may only be an average camera at a good price point, but look at all the crap you get with it!edit 12/13/09: accidently put digital zoom where it should have been optical.

She is absolutely thrilled with it.You can take videos with it & then hook it up to your tv to watch the videos or look at the pictures.  Our daughter says it'seasy to figure out; her dad told her to read the book & she did & is using it like a pro! The packaging also appealed to her, I knewit was mostly just fluff, but it being a Christmas gift, I was ok with that!  We love it.

Awesome purchase for your budding photographer!", "Author": "Clann Mother \"Clan Mother\"", "ReviewID": "R11CTJRJ2UUSZB", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I purchased this for my 9 year old daughter who LOVEs to take pics and video. She actually saved her allowance and I wanted to find her a good, but economical camera. She found it a bonus to get the crayons and storage box.  And what is cool about the software included is that my daughter can take her own pictures and turn them into coloring pages. She's already made coloring books for her siblings!!  And the price on these go up and down...keep your eye out and you can get a steal! We were watching the pink one, but when that price went up we were stoked to see the blue one went down. They also have this  in black. The case is great for storage and travelPros:Great quality pics and good video.AWESOME zoom.Easy download to computer.Good accompanying software w/USB cordEasy to use.Awesome camera for kids.Cons:batteries...it take 2 double A batteries...buy good electronic rechargables to get more bang (and pictures) for your buck. I highly recommend the the Sanyo Eneloop rechargable batteries...they seem to last \"forever\" in her camera and recharge in 15 min. (And amazon has them for a great price!)Somewhat slow response between picture taking. Could be a bit frustrating for adults who want to take pictures \"fast.\"Takes the \"micro\" SD - not a deal breaker, but had to purchase.", "Date": "August 10, 2010"}, {"Title": "Grandson Loved It!", "Author": "S.

When we first tried to use it, it was really slow to do anything. I figured it was the camera settings, so i changed all the settings and tried most of them to figure out which would be best. Either way it went, the camera is REALLY slow at taking pictures and saving them to the memory card. The pictures all turn out really dark, whatever setting the camera is on. My sister has missed a lot of good pictures waiting for this camera to be ready to take a picture. Don't waste your time buying this camera. I am so disappointed that my money went to waste the way it did. Also when I placed my order I wanted the camera in blue, and I was sent the black one. I'm not sure why Olympus cameras are so highly rated because this is my second disappointment with the brand.
