However, before I do I need to explain what I mean.  I am not saying this camera is the best at everything or even anyone thing.  Cameras that are the best at something are usually specialized beasts that can really only do that one thing well.  What I am talking about is a camera the is so good in so many categories that it can joyfully be used for just about and photographic or video graphic purpose you may have.  The GH2 is that camera.Now that is out of the way we can get to the meat and potatoes of the review.  I shoot mostly Nikon and Panasonic and I primarily shoot stills.  I dabble in Video but do not proclaim myself any sort of an expert.  I can say if you are looking for the best handling combo/cam with the most features then the GH2 is the one you want.  Panasonic went out of its way to make this a video camera so that was its primary focus with this camera.  However, there are lots of payoffs for the stills part of this camera so this is the best m4/3 stills camera by a long shot also.  I will also say that the hard core video market is a niche market compared to the stills market because shallow depth of field video is hard to shoot properly and hard to edit.  The average home user has neither the time nor inclination to properly storyboard and shoot this type of video.  However, with that said, it is really nice to be able to shoot stills and video.  And basic home videos are a snap to shoot with this camera; much more so than any other DSLR with the exception of the Sony SLT A55/33 which at least has a fast auto focus also. To shoot nice home movies, put the mode dial to iA, press the red button, and you are shooting video.This camera is the next generation of cameras as it successfully blends the advantages of Point and Shoot cameras with the benefits of DSLRs and creates and incredibly small and powerful camera.  Listed below are some of the benefits and weakness you get from this next gen camera.What's HotThe handling on the GH2 is bar none the best handling \"DSLR\" on the market.  WIth smart controls, great layout, fast autofocusing, swivel screen, full time double live view, etc.  Even with how good the D7000 is, it still feels clunky after using the GH2.  I get into most of the details of this down below so I don't want to repeat the info here.  What I will say here is that you can do things with this camera you couldn't hope to do with DSLRs and you can generally set up your photo parameters much faster with this camera.  The menus on the GH2 are not very good.  However, the actual camera controls are so good you will rarely even need to use the menus.Program Shift - Forget using Aperture priority with this camera.  You can leave the camera in Program mode.  With program shift you can change the aperture setting and thus the shutter speed while in program mode.  To do this you press the shutter release button down half way to set the exposure.  Then if the numbers are in yellow you just rotate the rear dial switch to change aperture.  Want a shallower depth of field or faster shutter speed, then dial in a bigger aperture (smaller number).  If the numbers are not in yellow then you are currently in exposure compensation mode.  All you have to do is click the rear dial switch and then rotate it.  Snap.  What a neat feature.Extra Tele Convert (ETC) Mode in Video -  If you shoot video you are going to love this.  This is even great for home/casual video shooters.  The GH2 has a 16mp sensor but like every other consumer combo/cam shoots 2K video.  That means the picture is usually down-sampled to make it 2K.  This has some pluses and minuses.  Enter the GH2.  With the ETC mode the camera uses only 2K of the sensor.  This gives you an extra 2.6x crop factor.  Which means your total crop factor is now 5.2x.  So that brand spanking new 100-300mm you just got is now 520-1560mm with no light loss.  If you put a Nikon 135mm f2 then you now have a 702mm f2! lens for video.  There are some drawbacks for using ETC also but they are pretty negligible.Auto focus - the auto focus on the GH2 is twice as fast as the GH1 and the GH1 was the fastest of previous generation.  I have seen some very knowledgeable photographers saying it is as fast as mid-level DSLRs.  While I think it is supposed to be a complement I don't think it is a very good comparison.  I find the focus speed of DSLRs has most to do with what lens you have on.  There are some lenses that focus slowly on even a D3.  All of the lenses I have used on the GH1 focus very quickly except the 45-200mm.  That lens tends to be my slowest.  Non of the lenses I have focus as fast as a 70-200mm f/2.8 but the rest of them focus as fast if not faster than any of the other Nikon lenses I own.  The best I can say about this is that you won't notice the focus speed on the GH2 as it is fast enough to get out of your way.Smaller lighter camera - I recently went on a trip to Egypt and carried nothing but my Panasonic gear.  Two camera bodies, 5 lenses, 1 flash, an iPad, and camera bag.  Total weight 10lbs (3lbs of that was the bag itself).  My Nikon D300 and 14-24mm lens would have weight more just by themselves (I was carrying the Panasonic 7-14mm so I did have wide covered)Swivel Screen with full-time live view - You won't know what you are missing until you become used to this and how well it works.  Want to reach up as high as you can and shoot down;  No problems.  Want to get as low as possible but can't lay down in the mud or water; No problem.  Want to take a picture of you and your daughter but there is nobody around; No problem.  Turn the screen around aim the camera at you and use the screen to frame.  Something that makes photos interesting is showing the viewer something from a perspective they don't often see.  The swivel screen actively encourages this.  The other thing the swivel screen does is make shooting from a tripod a joy.  Because of how small and light this camera is you can use a much smaller tripod.  I have a 3lb tripod that can support 7lbs.  Also, you can now set you camera up in all sorts of whacky positions and just rotate the screen to be able to frame and focus.  Very nice.  Also, with no mirror to flip up you don't have to worry about any vibrations.Touch Focus implemented as slick as on the iPhone.  As I mentioned above you can shoot from many strange angles because you can swivel the screen to almost any angle.  However, if the camera did not focus on what you wanted it would be hard to change it.  Now you can simply touch the screen on what you want to focus and presto it will focus on that.  The GH2 is worth the price just for that.WYSIWYG - What you see is what you get.  Since you are looking at either the screen or the beautiful EVF, you are seeing what the sensor sees.  With a DSLR you are seeing what the lens sees.  This is an important difference.  If you forgot to reset your WB or Aperture or any camera setting, you will see it before you shoot.  On a DSLR you would have no idea until you looked at the pictures.  Also, if it is a low light situation, the EVF will start to noise up and start to lose some of its smoothness.  This is a warning to you that you need to use flash or a tripod.  With a DSLR the viewer becomes darker but you don't get a very good visual cue of how your camera is seeing it.  For me the most brilliant thing with WYSIWYG is setting exposure.  Because I can see what the camera is doing with exposure, I usually leave the camera in P mode.  Then I change the exposure by changing where I aim the camera, lock the exposure and then reframe for the subject.  It works something like this.  I am trying to take a picture of a person but the exposure is picking up to many bright objects, thereby dimming my subject.  So, I aim the camera to include more dark areas while keeping my subject in the shoot.  Then I press the shutter release button down half way to lock the exposure and focus.  Then I reframe back to the original photo.  This works so quickly you can try several exposures in less time than you could set one with the exposure compensation dial (which is actually exceedingly well executed on this camera also.)  In a DSLR, since you don't see the exposure, you are just basically guessing at what you want and then shooting, view the photo and fix.  Much slower.Shoot about any lens you want - The distance from the lens to sensor is so short, that with the appropriate adaptor, you can put just about any lens you want on this camera. Canon, Nikon, Leica, Voigtlander, Pentax, Sony, you can use them all.  Generally you need to use lenses which have aperture rings. Additionally, you do lose autofocus but there are many instances where this just doesn't matter.  Macro photography is a good example.  You can fit a Nikon 200mm f/4 onto the GH2 and then either get a 2:1 reproduction or a 1:1 reproduction with twice the depth of field.  It is like putting on a teleconverter without the loss of light and depth of field.  Brilliant.Great for Newbies - All DSLRs are easy for anyone to use and the GH2 is no exception.  The great handling makes the GH2 better for newbies in my opinion.  Anyway, all you have to do is put the camera into iA mode and start shooting.  This camera gets the subject correct more often then not and will make you look good.  In dynamic situation, I actually use the iA mode quite a bit.  I do this because the camera is good a recognizing as scene as a person, flower, scenery, etc.  The camera then instantly sets numerous setting to make that scene look as good as possible.  If you tried to do it yourself it could take a few minuets to set and then a few to set back.  Or even worse you forget to reset it and you next pictures look bad.  If I have time, then I will set the camera myself.  My daughter has been using the GH1 since she was 2.  Here hit rate initially was only about 10% usable picture and 1% good pictures.  Her hit rate now is about 70% usable pictures and 20% good pictures with about 5% really nice pictures.  She has such a different perspective that it is really interesting to see how she views the world.Image Quality - I am reluctant to put this in the review because all modern cameras have such good IQ that it really is not relevant in most cases and any discussion encourages pixel peeping instead of photo making.  I will say, if you are using this camera to make pictures to view on your monitor, or publish on the web, or print 8x10s this camera will more than meet your needs and if you do your part make some really nice photos.  The GH1 has been my go to camera for the past two years and I have made some amazing pictures with it.  The GH2 is better.  You can argue the merits of FX vs DX vs M4/3 until you are blue in the face but the fact of the matter is it just doesn't matter in todays age and each year it continues to matter less and less.  All cameras have their limitations and part of being a good photographer is know what those are and shooting around them.  As far as ISO goes, with the GH1, ISO 800 was the highest I would shoot except in an emergency.  With the GH2, ISO 1600 shoots clean (better than 800 on GH1) and 3200-6400 are perfectly usable.Stills while shooting Video - The GH1 would not let you take a still photo while shooting video.  The GH2 allows you to take a 14mp 16x9 picture while shooting video.  So now you can be taking video and when you see something you want a still photo of just press the shutter release and now you have a photo.  Brilliant.5 fps full 16mb resolution and 40fps 4mp pictures for up to 1 second - Here is a feature I have not really seen anyone talking about.  This camera has become a fantastic sports camera.  It will shoot full resolution at 5 fps which is pretty pedestrian but still more than adequate for most sporting events.  The 7D and A55 shoot 7 and 10 respectively.  However, the GH2 pulls a trick out of its hat with an electronic shutter that will shoot 4mp pictures 40fps for up to 1 second.  Now for those of you who think 4mp is yesterdays news.  That is a 2400x1600 size photo.  That is good enough to print a 12x8 photo from.  Combine this with the fantastic new 100-300mm lens and you can shoot 40fps at 200-600mm equivalent.  Wow.I can go on and on but this review is getting too long already.  Some of the features I haven't talked about are Aspect Bracketing, Advanced Scene Mode, My Color Mode, Film Mode, Face Recognition, Fn1-3 button (Function) and the C1-3 modes (Custom Modes).  You can really tell that someone who enjoys making pictures designed the layout and handling for this camera.  There are not a lot of cameras out there that can make that claim.'What's Not1/4000 top shutter speed and 1/160 flash sync speed -  Panasonic has given us a partial Electronic shutter on the GH2.  They were supposed to have released a full electronic shutter but instead wasted research resources on the fad know as 3D.  A full electronic shutter, as we are likely to see in the GH3, will probably have a shutter speed of 1/16000 and a flash sync speed around 1/2000-1/4000.  Also, it is like to be able to shoot 24+ fps for as long as the card can stand.Construction - The switches are a cheap feeling plastic.  Please panasonic put some nice metal or composite switches on this camera.  I never had it fail on my GH1 but I was always worried and careful of it.  This is a bit of a double edged sword as the current construction keeps the camera very light and as I said I have had no troubles with the GH1.  However, The mode nob rotates too easily.  When I am pulling the camera out of the camera bag I often accidentally rotate the mode nob.Panasonic Flashes are outdated, lacking in multiple features and are heinously expensive.  You may wonder the relevance of this in a camera review but if you seriously want to make nicely lit indoor pictures you are going to want a flash.3 years into M4/3 and we are still missing critical lenses - 12mm f/1.4  25mm f/1.4  45mm f/1.4  35-100mm f/2.8  300mm f/4  300mm f/2.8  1.4/1.7/2.0 Teleconverters.  All MIA.  This and the flashes are the only thing really holding the M4/3 system back as a dominant professional system.  To shoot events and wedding you really need the fast glass for the shallow depth of field and for catching special moments in poor lighting.Conclusion:The GH1 in my opinion was a truly revolutionary camera for its day and was the best all around camera on the planet.  The GH2 continues the revolution and has added some amazing new features such as touch screen, 40fps shooting speeds, ETC mode, hi ISO shooting, and the list just goes on and on.  Frankly, there is not another camera that can even come close to doing all of the things this camera is capable of.  It is the new best all around camera on the planet.Pros:40 fps 4mp shooting for up to 1 secTouch screen focusingBlazing fast auto focus -- twice as fast as the already fast GH-1Clean Pictures up to 1600 ISO -- Same as D700Best video in a combo-cam to dateMost shooting modes of any combo-camETC 2.6x extra crop factor turning your 100-300mm into a 520-1560mm video lensMulti-aspect 18mp (16 mp per aspect) sensorBest M4/3 sensor - delivering clean images at 1600 and useable to 6400 thanks to the 3 venus microprocessors for videoIMHO Pound for pound, dollar for dollar, the best all around camera on the planetCons:Still only 1/160 flash sync speedStill only 1/4000 max shutter speed3D is a Fad -- No one wants to have to find/wear some goofy glasses to watch TV or read a book all of the time.

All MIA.Stills Purchasing ThoughtsPanasonic GH2 with 14-140If you buy a M4/3 system then you are going to want this superzoom as your all around lens.  This lens cost $750 by itself.  This means if you don't already own this lens you are faced with a tough decision.  The GH1 with 14-140mm lens is selling for $950-1000.  If you buy the GH1 now and then wait six months to buy the GH2 body, you should be able to get that for around $700 at that time.  Then you would have two superb cameras for only $200 more than the GH2 system today.  The downside is, while the GH1 is still a great camera it is not in the league of the GH2.  If you do opt for this system, then the sister lens is the 100-300mm lens.  This would give you a 35mm equivalent coverage of 28mm-600mm with only 2 lenses.  Very very nice.Panasonic GH2 with 14-42This is the system that I bought simply because the body only was not available when I ordered.  The 14-42 is probably Panasonic's worst lens.  Optically it is fine but the construction is not up to the standards of Panasonic's other lenses.  I would avoid this combo and buy the GH1 with the 14-140 lens for the same price as this camera.  Then down the road buy the GH2 body only or wait for the GH2 body only.  If you are just burning to have a GH2, and you only have $1000 to spend then you can still set up a good system.  Get this, and the 45-200mm lens for a total of $1300.  Those two lenses cover you from 28-400mm and should serve just about every need.Panasonic GH2 Body OnlyGreat for anyone who already has M4/3 lenses or anyone just wanting to shoot with Leica lenses.Video Purchasing ThoughtsBuy the GH2--period dot.  There is no other consumer combo cam on the planet that can even come close to the GH2.", "Date": "December 17, 2010"}, {"Title": "Best M4/3 camera yet.", "Author": "Wyobookman", "ReviewID": "R2H6DGB6O134TS", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "**First off, I have given the GH2 five stars because of its general excellence and how much I love using this camera, but that is not to say it's without fault.**I am a huge fan of the micro 4/3 format. Point & shots are fine as such, but the lack of manual controls frustrates me as does image quality beyond a 5\"x7\" print. On the other hand, a full size DSLR feels too bulky in my hand and to carry around often. I learned basic photography using a 70's vintage Nikon FM, so the G-series size is more familiar to my hands than today's full size DSLRs. And with taking candids and street shots, it doesn't feel nearly as intrusive as a 1.5+lb DSLR kit does to me.So this is my third G-series Panasonic camera. Without a doubt, this is the best one yet. The G1 & G2 are great cameras in their own right, but the GH2 advances the M4/3 format to whole new level. I wanted a faster camera but had too much invested in this format to look elsewhere. The GH2 is faster in every respect over the G2. AF is noticeably quicker, and better yet, very accurate. I've yet to see it really tripped up. Shooting rate is very quick; much, much faster than the G2. Unfortunately it seems Panasonic didn't bump up the buffer size to keep up with the frames per second the camera's capable of. So after about 10 shot burst, the camera freezes up for 5-10 seconds or more, especially if you're shooting RAW -- and I'm using a class 10 8g card. Shooting in jpeg helps some. Don't think of using anything less than a class 6 card, even shooting jpeg. This is a shame as it keeps the camera from being a decent sports/action shooterHandling is one of my favorite things about the GH2. It feels good in my average-sized guy hands. If you're used to a DSLR, it may feel too light and lacking heft. Coming from point-and-shoots, it feels pretty solid and stable in hand. The thumb grip, while adequate, could be a bit bigger and stickier. The body does have a little too much of a plastic feel and sometimes seems a shade too light. Still, I never have the feeling of it slipping or squirting out of my hand.The ergonomics are very good. Frequently used settings have manual adjustments. If not, there are now 3 function buttons to customize, as well as 3 custom modes. Or you can drive through the menus. The touchscreen initially struck me as kind of superfluous: I could adjust everything without it. But after awhile, I found myself using the touchscreen much more than I thought I would. It adds another level of control. Sometimes I can't remember where to find setting, but often within two taps of the screen I'm adjusting what I want. It's very helpful in getting the focus point(s) just so on a tricky composition, setting white balance (see below) and reviewing shots.I always will miss an optical viewfinder, but the GH2's EVF is about as good a substitute as it gets. Smearing and rainbow effect are negligible and only appear in very poor light conditions, as does, not surprisingly, a lot of noise. Otherwise it does fine, even during a fast pan.I've never been much interested in shooting video, but in the little experimenting I've done, the image quality is absolutely amazing. A number of GH2 owners have posted vids on youtube. Some of these really got me salivating, even though I'm not a video guy. I suspect this may be the camera's better/stronger half.As for still images, Panasonic is closing in on DSLR quality. The dynamic range and low light speed are much, much improved since the G1, especially daylight, high contrast scenes. Blown highlights are just about a thing of the past. Low light image quality is now quite good at ISO 1600. I can get usable shots up to about ISO 3200, at which point noise is really becoming prevalent. Image stabilization is fine, I suppose: I've not noticed it one way or the other. The new Venus engine seems to render colors closer to their true values than earlier G-series were able to. Images out of the camera (once the WB is properly set, see below), seem sharper and more vivid than the slightly soft look Panasonic cameras I've owned tended to produce.However, there are two image related issues. First is the auto white balance. It's the camera's greatest weakness. AWB does a pretty good job in ordinary outdoor light, if on occasion a little bit off. Indoors, it's middling at best. In general, inside AWB is too warm, yellow actually, for indoor photos. Moreover, the preset modes, ie, cloudy, incandescent, etc, are quite off and are all but useless. I either set the balance myself -- this is where the touchscreen is very handy -- or use my custom presets. This bothers me less than it sounds. I've learned what to expect and adjust accordingly.The second issue is really more an issue of preference than a problem. When I'm feeling slow on the draw or just lazy, I'll select the full-on point-and-shoot mode, aka intelligent auto. Shots are consistent and just fine. However, here again, AWB can be a little off. ISO 400 seems to be the default daylight speed when 100 or 200 would be much better, and images once in awhile are little underexposed. Most of which can be addressed post process. But in semi-auto modes where the camera selects the ISO, having it default to ISO 400 when 100 or 200 is warranted, is annoying. But to be fair, in full iA mode, the camera will almost always choose the correct scene -- portrait, children, landscape, etc -- that you're trying to capture and produce pleasing results. Perhaps a firmware update will correct the WB issues and have a better algorithm for the auto ISO.I can't say I'm enamored of the the kit lens. It's the same lens my G2 came with. I didn't care for its particularly plasticky feel and look. One good bump and it looks like the plastic casing will crack. In operation I think it felt a little cheap too. Given I already had several M43 lenses, I had no need for a kit lens so I ordered the body only. BTW, if you're thinking of a zoom, skip the Pany 45-200mm --it's slow without giving that much zoom -- and go for the 100-300mm. Also, I highly recommend either of the Pany pancake lenses: the 14mm f2.5 or the 20mm f1.7. Both bring out a little something extra from the camera that I can't describe. Images just seem to have a depth, clarity, and tone that other lenses seem to miss. Plus fitted with a pancake lens the camera is small enough to fit in a large coat pocket.Print-wise, this is where the camera really rewards effort. The rare times I've gotten everything just right have yielded a large print or two I'm proud of. The focus modes and various metering modes are spot on, that is, of course, if the dummy at the controls has configured the camera properly.The issues with the white balance and the small buffer keep me from giving the GH2 an unqualified 5-star rating. 4 stars is too few for its overall excellence, so read the 5 stars as being 4.5.On a final note, I wouldn't say this format is for everyone. There are compromises, which become less with each new model, but you pay extra to lose the weight and bulk of a full-size DSLR. For less money you can buy a DSLR with better specs -- on paper at least. I get a kick out of using this camera, in a way like none other I've owned. Its size, its good handling and ease of use, and the way it rewards when you put it to work all justify the extra dollars out of my wallet.", "Date": "January 11, 2011"}, {"Title": "Best All Around Camera On The Planet", "Author": "shuTTL3bus \"shuTTL3bus @gmail .com\"", "ReviewID": "R3C1V8684VJJ9K", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Now I know that is a bold statement and I intend to back it up.

My Nikon D300 and 14-24mm lens would have weight more just by themselves (I was carrying the Panasonic 7-14mm so I did have wide covered)Swivel Screen with full-time live view - You won't know what you are missing until you become used to this and how well it works.  Want to reach up as high as you can and shoot down;  No problems.  Want to get as low as possible but can't lay down in the mud or water; No problem.  Want to take a picture of you and your daughter but there is nobody around; No problem.  Turn the screen around aim the camera at you and use the screen to frame.  Something that makes photos interesting is showing the viewer something from a perspective they don't often see.  The swivel screen actively encourages this.  The other thing the swivel screen does is make shooting from a tripod a joy.  Because of how small and light this camera is you can use a much smaller tripod.  I have a 3lb tripod that can support 7lbs.  Also, you can now set you camera up in all sorts of whacky positions and just rotate the screen to be able to frame and focus.  Very nice.  Also, with no mirror to flip up you don't have to worry about any vibrations.Touch Focus implemented as slick as on the iPhone.  As I mentioned above you can shoot from many strange angles because you can swivel the screen to almost any angle.  However, if the camera did not focus on what you wanted it would be hard to change it.  Now you can simply touch the screen on what you want to focus and presto it will focus on that.  The GH2 is worth the price just for that.WYSIWYG - What you see is what you get.  Since you are looking at either the screen or the beautiful EVF, you are seeing what the sensor sees.  With a DSLR you are seeing what the lens sees.  This is an important difference.  If you forgot to reset your WB or Aperture or any camera setting, you will see it before you shoot.  On a DSLR you would have no idea until you looked at the pictures.  Also, if it is a low light situation, the EVF will start to noise up and start to lose some of its smoothness.  This is a warning to you that you need to use flash or a tripod.  With a DSLR the viewer becomes darker but you don't get a very good visual cue of how your camera is seeing it.  For me the most brilliant thing with WYSIWYG is setting exposure.  Because I can see what the camera is doing with exposure, I usually leave the camera in P mode.  Then I change the exposure by changing where I aim the camera, lock the exposure and then reframe for the subject.  It works something like this.  I am trying to take a picture of a person but the exposure is picking up to many bright objects, thereby dimming my subject.  So, I aim the camera to include more dark areas while keeping my subject in the shoot.  Then I press the shutter release button down half way to lock the exposure and focus.  Then I reframe back to the original photo.  This works so quickly you can try several exposures in less time than you could set one with the exposure compensation dial (which is actually exceedingly well executed on this camera also.)  In a DSLR, since you don't see the exposure, you are just basically guessing at what you want and then shooting, view the photo and fix.  Much slower.Shoot about any lens you want - The distance from the lens to sensor is so short, that with the appropriate adaptor, you can put just about any lens you want on this camera. Canon, Nikon, Leica, Voigtlander, Pentax, Sony, you can use them all.  Generally you need to use lenses which have aperture rings. Additionally, you do lose autofocus but there are many instances where this just doesn't matter.  Macro photography is a good example.  You can fit a Nikon 200mm f/4 onto the GH2 and then either get a 2:1 reproduction or a 1:1 reproduction with twice the depth of field.  It is like putting on a teleconverter without the loss of light and depth of field.  Brilliant.Great for Newbies - All DSLRs are easy for anyone to use and the GH2 is no exception.  The great handling makes the GH2 better for newbies in my opinion.  Anyway, all you have to do is put the camera into iA mode and start shooting.  This camera gets the subject correct more often then not and will make you look good.  In dynamic situation, I actually use the iA mode quite a bit.  I do this because the camera is good a recognizing as scene as a person, flower, scenery, etc.  The camera then instantly sets numerous setting to make that scene look as good as possible.  If you tried to do it yourself it could take a few minuets to set and then a few to set back.  Or even worse you forget to reset it and you next pictures look bad.  If I have time, then I will set the camera myself.  My daughter has been using the GH1 since she was 2.  Here hit rate initially was only about 10% usable picture and 1% good pictures.  Her hit rate now is about 70% usable pictures and 20% good pictures with about 5% really nice pictures.  She has such a different perspective that it is really interesting to see how she views the world.Image Quality - I am reluctant to put this in the review because all modern cameras have such good IQ that it really is not relevant in most cases and any discussion encourages pixel peeping instead of photo making.  I will say, if you are using this camera to make pictures to view on your monitor, or publish on the web, or print 8x10s this camera will more than meet your needs and if you do your part make some really nice photos.  The GH1 has been my go to camera for the past two years and I have made some amazing pictures with it.  The GH2 is better.  You can argue the merits of FX vs DX vs M4/3 until you are blue in the face but the fact of the matter is it just doesn't matter in todays age and each year it continues to matter less and less.  All cameras have their limitations and part of being a good photographer is know what those are and shooting around them.  As far as ISO goes, with the GH1, ISO 800 was the highest I would shoot except in an emergency.  With the GH2, ISO 1600 shoots clean (better than 800 on GH1) and 3200-6400 are perfectly usable.Stills while shooting Video - The GH1 would not let you take a still photo while shooting video.  The GH2 allows you to take a 14mp 16x9 picture while shooting video.  So now you can be taking video and when you see something you want a still photo of just press the shutter release and now you have a photo.  Brilliant.5 fps full 16mb resolution and 40fps 4mp pictures for up to 1 second - Here is a feature I have not really seen anyone talking about.  This camera has become a fantastic sports camera.  It will shoot full resolution at 5 fps which is pretty pedestrian but still more than adequate for most sporting events.  The 7D and A55 shoot 7 and 10 respectively.  However, the GH2 pulls a trick out of its hat with an electronic shutter that will shoot 4mp pictures 40fps for up to 1 second.  Now for those of you who think 4mp is yesterdays news.  That is a 2400x1600 size photo.  That is good enough to print a 12x8 photo from.  Combine this with the fantastic new 100-300mm lens and you can shoot 40fps at 200-600mm equivalent.  Wow.I can go on and on but this review is getting too long already.  Some of the features I haven't talked about are Aspect Bracketing, Advanced Scene Mode, My Color Mode, Film Mode, Face Recognition, Fn1-3 button (Function) and the C1-3 modes (Custom Modes).  You can really tell that someone who enjoys making pictures designed the layout and handling for this camera.  There are not a lot of cameras out there that can make that claim.'What's Not1/4000 top shutter speed and 1/160 flash sync speed -  Panasonic has given us a partial Electronic shutter on the GH2.  They were supposed to have released a full electronic shutter but instead wasted research resources on the fad know as 3D.  A full electronic shutter, as we are likely to see in the GH3, will probably have a shutter speed of 1/16000 and a flash sync speed around 1/2000-1/4000.  Also, it is like to be able to shoot 24+ fps for as long as the card can stand.Construction - The switches are a cheap feeling plastic.  Please panasonic put some nice metal or composite switches on this camera.  I never had it fail on my GH1 but I was always worried and careful of it.  This is a bit of a double edged sword as the current construction keeps the camera very light and as I said I have had no troubles with the GH1.  However, The mode nob rotates too easily.  When I am pulling the camera out of the camera bag I often accidentally rotate the mode nob.Panasonic Flashes are outdated, lacking in multiple features and are heinously expensive.  You may wonder the relevance of this in a camera review but if you seriously want to make nicely lit indoor pictures you are going to want a flash.3 years into M4/3 and we are still missing critical lenses - 12mm f/1.4  25mm f/1.4  45mm f/1.4  35-100mm f/2.8  300mm f/4  300mm f/2.8  1.4/1.7/2.0 Teleconverters.  All MIA.  This and the flashes are the only thing really holding the M4/3 system back as a dominant professional system.  To shoot events and wedding you really need the fast glass for the shallow depth of field and for catching special moments in poor lighting.Conclusion:The GH1 in my opinion was a truly revolutionary camera for its day and was the best all around camera on the planet.  The GH2 continues the revolution and has added some amazing new features such as touch screen, 40fps shooting speeds, ETC mode, hi ISO shooting, and the list just goes on and on.  Frankly, there is not another camera that can even come close to doing all of the things this camera is capable of.  It is the new best all around camera on the planet.Pros:40 fps 4mp shooting for up to 1 secTouch screen focusingBlazing fast auto focus -- twice as fast as the already fast GH-1Clean Pictures up to 1600 ISO -- Same as D700Best video in a combo-cam to dateMost shooting modes of any combo-camETC 2.6x extra crop factor turning your 100-300mm into a 520-1560mm video lensMulti-aspect 18mp (16 mp per aspect) sensorBest M4/3 sensor - delivering clean images at 1600 and useable to 6400 thanks to the 3 venus microprocessors for videoIMHO Pound for pound, dollar for dollar, the best all around camera on the planetCons:Still only 1/160 flash sync speedStill only 1/4000 max shutter speed3D is a Fad -- No one wants to have to find/wear some goofy glasses to watch TV or read a book all of the time.

This means if you don't already own this lens you are faced with a tough decision.  The GH1 with 14-140mm lens is selling for $950-1000.  If you buy the GH1 now and then wait six months to buy the GH2 body, you should be able to get that for around $700 at that time.  Then you would have two superb cameras for only $200 more than the GH2 system today.  The downside is, while the GH1 is still a great camera it is not in the league of the GH2.  If you do opt for this system, then the sister lens is the 100-300mm lens.  This would give you a 35mm equivalent coverage of 28mm-600mm with only 2 lenses.  Very very nice.Panasonic GH2 with 14-42This is the system that I bought simply because the body only was not available when I ordered.  The 14-42 is probably Panasonic's worst lens.  Optically it is fine but the construction is not up to the standards of Panasonic's other lenses.  I would avoid this combo and buy the GH1 with the 14-140 lens for the same price as this camera.  Then down the road buy the GH2 body only or wait for the GH2 body only.  If you are just burning to have a GH2, and you only have $1000 to spend then you can still set up a good system.  Get this, and the 45-200mm lens for a total of $1300.  Those two lenses cover you from 28-400mm and should serve just about every need.Panasonic GH2 Body OnlyGreat for anyone who already has M4/3 lenses or anyone just wanting to shoot with Leica lenses.Video Purchasing ThoughtsBuy the GH2--period dot.  There is no other consumer combo cam on the planet that can even come close to the GH2.", "Date": "December 17, 2010"}, {"Title": "Best all around Camera?  Yes!", "Author": "Amazon Customer", "ReviewID": "R3Q9QV7U7ZH0BQ", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I was fortunate to have the GH2 very early in its distribution cycle in the US, so I've had time to get used to its quirks and abilities, and frankly the \"Best all around camera\" title is well deserved IF put into context.As with most pro and semi-pro cameras, the quality of output is mainly due to the PHOTOGRAPHER not the camera.  I've been a pro photographer for 30 years, but gave up the craft for the past ten years or so, moving back to simpler point and shoot cameras for vacations.  When it's your \"job\" taking photos, vacation pictures can seem too much like work.  :-)  The convergence of digital photography and videography finally prompted me back into the semi-pro field.  And I've got to say, the GH2 has me totally excited about photography again!!A few points to add to the other reviews made here:1) Yes, the auto white balance is the GH2's one achilles heel.  It's just not that good indoors.  This can be completely fixed through RAW file conversion (more on that later) but is more of a problem with video.  Just make sure to use the indoor white balance modes instead of AWB.  They work fine.2) The GH2 viewfinder is WORLDS better than most digital DSLR's, except for the full frame pro cameras that weigh and cost tons more.  The APS-C DSLRS have pathetically small viewfinders.  It's like looking through a toy periscope.  Not so with the GH2. As an old film camera photographer, I had no problem getting used to the wysiwyg digital viewfinder, and it really helps indoors to see more detail than your naked eye can see.3) JPG output straight from the camera can look a bit soft and muddy, but this is totally due to image settings, not the inherent data of the image.  Panasonic uses a much more conservative \"film like\" setting, with low sharpening and contrast.  It's always easier to add these items in post processing.  Many newer digital cameras crank saturation, sharpening, noise reduction, and contrast up to ridiculous levels to give that \"punch\" so many amateurs seem to like.  But remember, jpgs are \"lossy\" images.  Every time you tweak the settings of a jpg in post processing, you reduce the quality a bit.  The solution?  Experiment with the in-camera settings (and there are plenty) to get the perfect image values you prefer.  By altering the contrast, saturation, and sharpening settings from the menu, you can achieve a punchy shot to rival any other semi-pro camera.4) If you're a point and shoot amateur looking for a simple camera that requires no thought or creativity to crank out mildly decent photos, then the GH2 may not be for you.  In fact, stay away from digital SLR's altogether.  You'll be happier.  On the other hand, if you want SUPERIOR photo quality, then start shooting with RAW files.  I love setting the GH2 to JPG+RAW.  That way, I can punch up the jpg settings to get that \"amateur\" punch straight out of the camera for viewing while on vacation with friends, but I have the excellent RAW files to tweak to my heart's content later, when I want the best quality possible.  And since RAW is a lossless format, you can tweak anything and everything.  That's when you will really start to appreciate the professional quality possible with the GH2.One software package I HIGHLY RECOMMEND for the GH2 is DXO Optics Pro.  This post processing software is close to a miracle and has tuned modules for the GH2 and lenses.  It automates most of the post processing of images, in both jpg and RAW formats.  Take a RAW image and run it through DXO, and you will get an almost perfect combination of noise reduction, contrast enhancement, highlight recovery, lens distortion correction, and white balance.  I find most of the images turn out perfect with the default settings.  It's the \"lazy mans\" Photoshop without all the tweaking.  Check it out at dxo.com.5) The addition of video makes the GH2's \"world's best all around camera\" claim a reality.  If you've never done video, like me, the option to capture 1080i video right from my digital camera is truly enlightening!  The secret to good vacation (or pro) photography is to be ready for the perfect shot whenever it occurs.  Having ONE camera with a 14-140 zoom (28-280 35mm equivalent) that can also take breathtaking video, ensures that you won't be fumbling around with lenses and camcorders while the action passes you by.6) Low light capability with this camera is amazing!  Just make sure to set ISO to automatic, and set the upper limit to 3200.  (from the menu) You will get perfectly usable images, especially if you post process RAW files through Photoshop or DXO.  But remember, a 14-140 lens on a sensor this large is never going to be a fast indoor lens.  Get the 20mm 1.7 for excellent indoor images.  It also makes the camera much more like a point and shoot for those indoor parties and children shots.7) Depth of field: This may be one area where amateurs get confused and disappointed.  Smaller sensor point and shoot cameras have inherently greater depth of field, making it easier to keep a video or quick photo in focus.  The shallower depth of field of the GH2 and other DSLR's takes some getting used to, but it is also why the videos will look so professional when done right.  Most movies use shallow depth of field as a key technique in focusing the viewer's attention.  You can literally take movie quality videos with the GH2, which is why the amateur film movement has embraced it.8) Lens interchangeability: This is great feature, especially for video!  I have many old manual Nikon lenses that work wonders on the GH2.  Yes, you lose autofocus and aperture control, but if you put the camera in aperture priority mode, and turn on auto-ISO, the camera will still expose images properly and automatically.  The lack of autofocus is not that big of a deal.  I've taken plenty of excellent photos during my career with manual focus.  The REAL advantage comes with video though, where manual focus is an ADVANTAGE, not a liability.So is the GH2 perfect?  Of course not, any more than any other digital camera, but its flaws can be easily circumvented with post processing.  You simply will not find any other camera on the market that combines so many different professional features into one, small, inexpensive package.", "Date": "April 10, 2011"}, {"Title": "Excellent camera", "Author": "Lester", "ReviewID": "R2KBQDOYW30NT7", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I have recently owned the Panasonic G1 and GH1, been very pleased with them, and thought that getting the GH2 would be 'just another upgrade'.  Not so.  The ergonomics give a camera that is an absolute joy to use.  The touch screen totally transforms macro and tripod shooting, while the buttons, knobs, dials, and switches bring every major photographic parameter to your finger-tips.  I agree with the earlier 5-star reviews here, but must say that on my camera, I find the knob action is firm (much firmer than G1 or GH1) and will never be accidentally knocked into a different setting, and that the other switches are adequately robust.  I have found the Olympus flashes (FL50, ring, twin) all work perfectly with the Panasonic.  I'd recommend the 14-140 lens, its a great all-rounder and takes 80% of my shots, even though I have the 7-14, 14-45, 20, 45-200, 45 macro, and 100-300 in my bag.", "Date": "December 19, 2010"}, {"Title": "The best interchangeable lens hybrid HD video/still camera yet !", "Author": "Joseph Ogiba \"jogiba21\"", "ReviewID": "R1XDVMLAGLTVXF", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I was going to get the Canon 60D body to use with my Pentax K mount lenses from 6.5mm to 2350mm but after seeing the first reviews comparing it to the new GH2 I decided to get the GH2 instead and wow they were right.

I have both cameras now and here are my Pros and Cons:(1) BODY DESIGN/FORM FACTOR:GH2 is flimsy, buttons are harder to push, and it seems like a point and shoot on steroids.  Although, LCD swivel touch screen is fantastic and Electronic viewfinder eliminates the need for an LCD eye piece.  Focus is easier to accomplish is a shorter amount of time.7D is built tough, weather proof, much larger and seemingly more durable.  So it will work in the rain, in the snow, and in the desert.  Buttons are easy to find, settings are fast and simple to change.  Although, no swivel screen for odd angles, need a LCD eye piece to maintain good focus.Winner: GH2 - the LCD touch swivel screen and EVS is unmatched -- just don't drop the camera.(2) LENS SELECTION:GH2 can use almost any lens you can think of as long as you have the proper adapter.  And now with the tele-zoom function, you can even use those old school C-Mount TV lenses.  Only problem is that everything is then manually controlled and there are not many wide angle lenses for cheap.The autofocus lenses are useful in run-and-gun shooting environments.  Although, the native autofocus lenses are very limiting and often horrible in low light.  The 14-42mm kit lens is a better investment than the 14-140mm lens.  For the money, the 14-140mm is a rip off.7D has a better selection of powerful canon glass that it can electronically control, but no autofocus during video and even though there are many lens adapters for the 7D, it doesn't compare to the amount of options the GH2 has.Winner: GH2 - once you get over the crop factor, the GH2 gives you more lens options.(3) AUDIO:GH2 has manual control over audio, albeit only four levels to choose from.  You also get audio bars during recording.  But the audio input jack is only 2.5mm, so you need an adapter to connect most mics to the camera.7D has auto gain control, which means you have no manual control of the audio and no bar levels to monitor it.Winner - GH2 - no brainer.(4) FRAME RATE OPTIONS:GH2 is only good at 1080(24p) and 1080(60i), the rest sucks balls. No PAL.7D is good at almost everything. 24p, 30p, 25p, 60p, -- you name it, 7D has got it.Winner - 7D(5) VIDEO QUALITY:GH2 is AVCHD 24mbps, has less moire, aliasing, and rolling shutter.7D is MOV 48mbps, can have awful moire, aliasing, and rolling shutter.Winner: GH2.  This is a tough one cuz the 7D has proven itself in Hollywood.  If the environment could be tightly controlled, the 7D would be the winner.  But I shoot run-and-gun with no control over my environment so I trust the GH2 over the 7D -- if the lenses were the same.(6) STILL IMAGE:Winner: 7D -- no contest.  The Panasonic LX5, a point and shoot, can give you the same images the GH2 can.  That's bad.CONCLUSION:I'm keeping both the GH2 and the 7D, but if you can only get one, get the GH2.  It's more bang for your buck.The GH2 is better for run-and-gun shoots where I cannot control my surroundings.  It's small, easier to conceal, and I don't need a lot of accessories to get proper focus and audio.  The still image quality sucks, but it's better than nothing.  This is the perfect documentary camera, travel camera, all-purpose hybrid camera.The 7D is better for controlled environments where I have time to set lights, mess with dual audio or if taking good still images is important.  If I'm shooting a narrative film or music video, the 7D is my camera of choice.", "Date": "February 26, 2011"}, {"Title": "Elegant design and balance...", "Author": "Bron \"Bron\"", "ReviewID": "R10G5NY3RCRW4B", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "OK.  First, B. Fuller's incredible review nails it (and deserves 5 stars itself!) and I am not going to even attempt to re-plow the ground he covers so well.  Go read his review for all the details as to why this camera is simply the best value you can find, currently.  I will simply add a few comments in support of his excellent review.To me, what makes this camera special is the elegant design and balance.  It is an engineering marvel.  I own and still use an Olympus E-10 camera.  The E-10 is (along with the E-1) one of the best cameras ever made (IMHO) and broke open a new market and new photographic territory in it's day.  The GH1 and GH2 are similar to the E-10 and E-1 in that respect, they are breaking ground and leading the way into a new era in terms of photography and videography.  This is truly an exciting camera and will be, in time, a classic.First, this camera is capable of better video than nearly any video only camera you can likely lay your hands on.  It is truly capable of professional quality.  With the ETC feature, stereo sound and the quality lenses available, literally new worlds open up.  It's jaw dropping stuff we're talking about here.Second, the still photography is also pro level.  Extremely good quality images...super fast auto-focus and many top of the line features, such as an excellent electronic view finder (a VF is essential to me).  Outstanding sensor, good lenses, and a compact, portable package.  The best camera is the one you have with you!Finally, the handling is exceptional.  This is a camera for someone who loves photography and obviously was designed by a team that actually does photography.  Things are well thought out and everything simply works well.  Again, not since the Oly E-10/E-1 era have I been as excited about a camera as this one. (The only other company doing anything nearly as exciting, to me, is -- believe it or not -- Samsung and their NX line of cameras.  Well, and maybe Sony, but I do not like their cameras.)If you are willing to spend serious money, then you are definitely going to get good value for your hard earned bucks and, more importantly, I will bet you are going to be inspired by this camera.  The E-10 made me fall in love with photography all over again, and I expect many will have a similar experience with the GH2.Five solid golden stars for this one -- good job Panasonic!-----------------------------------------------------------P.S. If the GH2 is a bit too expensive, you might take a look at the G2 which is sort of a junior edition of this camera with many similar features:Panasonic Lumix DMC-G2 12.1 MP Live MOS Interchangeable Lens Camera with 3-Inch Touch Screen LCD and 14-42mm Lumix G VARIO f/3.5-5.6 MEGA OIS Lens (Black)", "Date": "December 17, 2010"}, {"Title": "My new favorite camera", "Author": "DSLR Shooter", "ReviewID": "R3DZMUBIW0MRFE", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I am approaching this review from the professional video perspective.The Panasonic gh2 is by far, without a shadow of a doubt, the best video DSLR I have ever used. Prior to this purchase I have owned the Canon 5d mkII, Canon 7d, and the Panasonic GH1. All of which had their respective ups and downs. My biggest issue with these cameras was that they compromised image quality in one fashion or another. The canon's all had issues with Moire and cooling. The Panasonic was crippled by its lackluster codec and low light performance.I purchased this camera in the hopes that it would be a versatile B camera to support my AF100 during interviews and documentary shoots. It does not disappoint, in fact I find myself taking the gh2 out more than the af100 for most small shoots because of its size and convenience.I love the fact that I can adapt literally any lens to the camera without having to use optical correcting filters or invasive modifications (canon PL Mount modification). This camera is a true hybrid. It has an EVF, flip screen, audio gain control, long record time, exceptionally clean image, overcrank and undercrank options... the list goes on. All for $1000. That is the price of a nice consumer camera! But it preforms like a pro camcorder.The camera is extremely easy to use. Buttons are well placed, menu's are easy to navigate, and everything is right where it should be. The touch interface is surprisingly comfortable to use. I would note though that I am very tech savvy so it may not be as easy to use for a beginner.There is some room for improvement. Panasonic should adopt the global shutter in their cameras to eliminate skew (mos roll) on fast pans, even though it is much less pronounced than the canon and nikon cameras that I have used. I feel like the camera is more then capable of doing a solid 1080p @ 60fps with a high bitrate yet it can't really do it due its limited firmware. More options for overcrank and undercrank would be nice: instead of %'s it should be FPS. Options for audio monitoring while recording like a 3.5 headphone jack would be a huge plus. A battery grip would be a welcome accessory for extended shoots.All in all Panasonic did an excellent job with this camera and they have set the bar for what is to come in the Video DSLR field. I look forward to canons answer to this camera. Hopefully the 5d mkIII will come out this year!**When editing, convert the .mts files to Apple Pro Res 422 not only does this save time in the edit but it also holds up better to color grading. Native AVCHD files tend to break under heavy grading, so keep this in mind when prepping for post work.***Edit* After further testing it looks like the GH2 has a better dynamic range (ability to get a good exposure in a high contrast environment) than my 7d during video recording. I am not sure as to what the cameras actual DR is during video, DXOmark has it listed at 11.5 stops for stills. I can also say that it seems to control the highlights better than my af100 and 7d in high contrast environments, though this has a lot to do with the gamma settings in the camera itself. In a controlled environment all these cameras would look great! But for real world usability, shooting outdoors, and unpredictable environments the GH2 stands by itself. I would say that if you are looking for a versatile camera for documentary and production work, this is by far the best value closely followed by the af100. If you are just looking for something to shoot in controlled environments or a lot of stills with, a canon may be the better choice. I know that they are fazing out the t2i right now so you could probably pick it up for cheap.I would also look into picking up some lenses in the m42 mount (aka pentax screw mount). They are practically universal and can be adapted to most lens mounts for about $5. I use them on my Canon and Panasonic cameras with great results. If you look carefully you can pick some old Ziess lenses for a good price. I was able to build a full prime kit for a couple thousand over the course of a couple months. Old lenses aren't the best but they will save you lots of money and heart ache when you are starting out.", "Date": "February 22, 2011"}, {"Title": "Great video, not so great stills but a good all around performer", "Author": "EnsH \"ensh\"", "ReviewID": "R1X0I4YZCJK59A", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "I needed to do a small video project and the GH2 + 14-42mm seemed the best value. I decided to try it because I had good experience in the past with the Panasonic FZ series. My current camera is a DSLR (Pentax K-5).The good:- video looks is really excellent and it's much easier to use an EVF for this. It's no secret that the GH2 is highly rated amongst indie filmmakers, that's the best camera for that job under 3000$ beating even the Canon 7D and 5D mark II.- the kit lens is surprisingly good.- AF is unreal fast. I didn't expect CD-AF to be that fast, it's at least on par with any PD-AF (DSLR) I tried. It's completely silent and 100% accurate. Face detection is useful. One thing though that slow down things is that even if the lens is already focused it will refocus for the next shot, this is how CD-AF works. A DSLR  will not do that and that's why they're also much superiors for tracking moving subjects.- It's lighter and smaller than any DSLR- MF is easier thanks to well defined magnification but alas no focus peaking feature. Focus by wire is actually nicer to use than most modern DSLR lens.- Love the multi aspect concept. This one of the reason I did go with the GH2 instead of the G3.- Stereo mic with very good quality. For family videos I don't feel the need for an external mic (Rode) like I did on my K-5.- Touch screen is cool for quickly shooting something off-center.- The camera general responsiveness, although not exceptional, is very good. Turn on the camera you'll be ready to shoot in less than 1 second. You'll rarely miss a shot. Shutter lag is also not an issue.- Some cool and unique features: The ETC mode (digital zoom that works well with video), the touch shutter (touch a part of the screen and it will focus on that point and take a picture), the 40fps mode at 4 megapixels (works for just one second though) and the multi aspect sensor already mentioned.The bad:- Ergonomics are not great. It makes me appreciate how good my K-5 (and any other Pentax) is in this regard. Just one example: in P mode you can shift with the rear dial but if you want to go back to automatic, the manual tells you that there 2 choices: either you turn on and off the camera (!) or use the rear dial and go to the start of the P-shift range. Pentax does this very simply with the green button which reset settings (auto P, auto ISO, EV, etc) in one push. Menus are slow to traverse, and UI is ugly and confusing. Redeeming feature: the 3 fn customizable buttons.- Just one dial. Their old FZ50 had two dials but somehow Panasonic decided that the second dial was not needed on what is supposed to be their top camera. Maybe they think the click dial is a good substitute for a second dial. It's not.- There is a record movie button but you don't get access to all the video features (ex: 24p). For that you need to use the dial mode to select the Manual movie mode.- Video is great but a bit more difficult to use than it should be. The options are messy and not well labeled. And to get the most of the video performance you need to install a hack (not that difficult but would have been nice to not need it).- Sharpness is great but the sensor is clearly a notch (at least 1 stop) below some DSLR (in particular the Nikon and Pentax). It also starts at iso 160 which is not helping IQ (Image Quality) at base ISO. Check DXOmark for the hard figures.- build quality too plastic (their old FZ50 was much better IMHO). On the other hand the camera is very light.- Loud shutter. OK the Pentax K-5 is in a class of its own but still... For a mirrorless camera it's a bit disappointing that they didn't implement a least a quiet mode where they would use the electronic shutter instead. It's just a firmware issue because the 40fps mode allows this.- Flash x-sync is only 1/160s. Panasonic needs to find a solution to get rid of the mechanical shutter in an all-electronic camera.- EVF is really good but you need to be perfectly centered otherwise there's a kind of CA appearing. And why put an EVF in the center of the camera? I have a big nose. Sony has a much better design with the Nex-7. Hello Panasonic, and EVF doesn't have to be centered with the lens, I thought that was an advantage of not having to bow to an optical path.- No wireless remote. Come on, even the low-end Pentax have it. There is a cable remote but it's shared with the micro input. A bit disappointing on such an expensive camera.- Battery life quite low but this is kind of expected on a mirrorless camera.Summary: A bit too expensive for what it offers unless you need video for which it has no pair. Ergonomics and build quality are below average. So is the quality of still pictures unless you come from a P&S.; Suggested better alternatives for stills: Nikon (D5100, D3200, D7000) or Pentax (K-5, K30) or even some of the Sony SLT. But the GH2 can be an excellent compromise if you value light and small over ultimate image quality.", "Date": "June 17, 2012"}, {"Title": "The Best Camera I've Ever Used", "Author": "Steven M. Frankel", "ReviewID": "RM52SPDBFDHC3", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Panasonic Lumix DMC-GH2 16.05 MP Live MOS Interchangeable Lens Camera with 3-inch Free-Angle Touch Screen LCD and 14-42mm Hybrid Lens (Black)My GH2 arrived this week from Amazon and I'm nothing but delighted with the quality and versatility of the outfit.  I worked my way through college photographing weddings, sports event and beauty queen pagents, and turning out more than 1,000 enlargements a month.  My experience goes back to the 4x5\" Crown Graphics, Rollies, Canons, Nikons, etc., and has gone through uninterruptibly more than a dozen digital cameras including the Lumix G1& GH-1.  Suffice to say that this is the BEST and MOST VERSITILE camera I've ever owned or borrowed.For still photography, it offers a devestating combination of quality and portability.  Thanks to a year with the GH1, I've got the 14-140mm and 20mm lenses, and thanks to this purchase the 14-42mm lens as well.  All perform admirably and I'm really loath to leave any of them behind when I go out shooting.  And, thanks to their small form factors and low weight, I don't have to abondon any of my beauties!  Rather, the body and all 3 lenses fit nicely in a Lowepro Nova 180 AW bag, along with a Blackrapid camera sling (that I consider a \"must\" purchase) and all the normal accessories including the charger, lens shades & filters -- and the total package weighs just under 5 pounds!It took me only a day to dispell the reluctance I had experienced about spending $100 more for the kit with the 14-42 lens.  \"Wasn't this overkill,\" I thought.  No way! Yesterday I was doing observations of a Los Angeles Regional Youth Orchestra program and more-or-less on a whim I decided to do a real-life fieldtest of my purchase.  I mounted the 14-42 mm lens for this indoor assignment because the 14-140 -- although it has tremendous \"reach\" and produces very sharp images -- was slower in aperature and relatively heavy and would have been in the way when I had to take notes on a clipboard.  And, the 20mm -- although blazingly fast, light and producing terrific quality images -- didn't have the \"reach\" I needed to shoot in an indoor gym that was about 50x150 feet with action going on all around.In this case the 14-42 turned out to be an ideal compromise.  It was only slightly heavier and larger than the 20mm 1.7 lens, and yet it was a full stop faster than the 14-140 zoom and had the \"anti-shake\" mechanism that the 20mm lens lacks (thus making up for most of the 1.7 lens' speed advantage).  Consequantly, it was the perfect lens for this well-lighted, large indoor venue.  Also, when I put it video mode it performed beautifully and I was able to shoot video clips that I'll use to supplement my written observations which -- by themselves -- I now perceive as being hopelessly dry and uniformative compared to embedding video clips with my writing.When I go back to shooting sailboat races where you have to zoom in on boats that may be from 3' to 300' away from your lens, I'll suck it up and lug the 14-140; when I need to shoot people indoors incompspicuously under poor lighting conditions, I'll give thanks for the 20mm 1.7 lens; but for assignments such as yesterday's, the 14-42 mm zoom was perfect for the job.One other thing about the 14-42mm lens -- it's lighter and more \"plasticy\" than the 14-45mm zoom it replaced on the GH1, but frankly I think it's better both from the standpoints of quality and portability.  I sold off my 14-45 lens after only a month of use; but based on yesterday's results I think the 14-42 is a keeper.More important than any of the above comments:  I'm finding the GH2 is a \"game-changer\" for any of us still photographers that write for a living and suddenly realizes that they can can enrich everything from research reports, to travelogues, to product reviews with generous doses of video.  I didn't feel that way about my halting efforts to produce videos with the GH1, but the videos I was able to turn out yesterday without ever reading the manual makes me a fan of gh2 videos for life -- or at least until the next generation arrives!  Also, don't even talk to me about competitors that don't have high-quality optical-style viewfinders; I don't view them as being worth considering for anything that smacks of \"seriuous work.\"Finally -- please note that I haven't gone into any technical data relating to the gh2's performance or more rigorous comparisons to the other ways you can blow $1000-$2500 on your next camera.  For this kind of info, just go to the review on digitalcamera-hq.com which is the most useful and even-handed review I've seen.  They too consider the gh2 to be a game-changer for lots of reasons, but they also point out some things that Panasonic will need to fix via firmware updates or in the next generation of these fantastic cameras.", "Date": "February 6, 2011"}, {"Title": "Best All Around Camera in the World", "Author": "shuTTL3bus \"shuTTL3bus @gmail .com\"", "ReviewID": "R2KZXSSVEWP3UR", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Now I know that is a bold statement and I intend to back it up.  However, before I do I need to explain what I mean.  I am not saying this camera is the best at everything or even anyone thing.  Cameras that are the best at something are usually specialized beasts that can really only do that one thing well.  What I am talking about is a camera the is so good in so many categories that it can joyfully be used for just about and photographic or video graphic purpose you may have.  The GH2 is that camera.Now that is out of the way we can get to the meat and potatoes of the review.  I shoot mostly Nikon and Panasonic and I primarily shoot stills.  I dabble in Video but do not proclaim myself any sort of an expert.  I can say if you are looking for the best handling combo/cam with the most features then the GH2 is the one you want.  Panasonic went out of its way to make this a video camera so that was its primary focus with this camera.  However, there are lots of payoffs for the stills part of this camera so this is the best m4/3 stills camera by a long shot also.  I will also say that the hard core video market is a niche market compared to the stills market because shallow depth of field video is hard to shoot properly and hard to edit.  The average home user has neither the time nor inclination to properly storyboard and shoot this type of video.  However, with that said, it is really nice to be able to shoot stills and video.  And basic home videos are a snap to shoot with this camera; much more so than any other DSLR with the exception of the Sony SLT A55/33 which at least has a fast auto focus also. To shoot nice home movies, put the mode dial to iA, press the red button, and you are shooting video.This camera is the next generation of cameras as it successfully blends the advantages of Point and Shoot cameras with the benefits of DSLRs and creates and incredibly small and powerful camera.  Listed below are some of the benefits and weakness you get from this next gen camera.What's HotThe handling on the GH2 is bar none the best handling \"DSLR\" on the market.  WIth smart controls, great layout, fast autofocusing, swivel screen, full time double live view, etc.  Even with how good the D7000 is, it still feels clunky after using the GH2.  I get into most of the details of this down below so I don't want to repeat the info here.  What I will say here is that you can do things with this camera you couldn't hope to do with DSLRs and you can generally set up your photo parameters much faster with this camera.  The menus on the GH2 are not very good.  However, the actual camera controls are so good you will rarely even need to use the menus.Program Shift - Forget using Aperture priority with this camera.  You can leave the camera in Program mode.  With program shift you can change the aperture setting and thus the shutter speed while in program mode.  To do this you press the shutter release button down half way to set the exposure.  Then if the numbers are in yellow you just rotate the rear dial switch to change aperture.  Want a shallower depth of field or faster shutter speed, then dial in a bigger aperture (smaller number).  If the numbers are not in yellow then you are currently in exposure compensation mode.  All you have to do is click the rear dial switch and then rotate it.  Snap.  What a neat feature.Extra Tele Convert (ETC) Mode in Video -  If you shoot video you are going to love this.  This is even great for home/casual video shooters.  The GH2 has a 16mp sensor but like every other consumer combo/cam shoots 2K video.  That means the picture is usually down-sampled to make it 2K.  This has some pluses and minuses.  Enter the GH2.  With the ETC mode the camera uses only 2K of the sensor.  This gives you an extra 2.6x crop factor.  Which means your total crop factor is now 5.2x.  So that brand spanking new 100-300mm you just got is now 520-1560mm with no light loss.  If you put a Nikon 135mm f2 then you now have a 702mm f2! lens for video.  There are some drawbacks for using ETC also but they are pretty negligible.Auto focus - the auto focus on the GH2 is twice as fast as the GH1 and the GH1 was the fastest of previous generation.  I have seen some very knowledgeable photographers saying it is as fast as mid-level DSLRs.  While I think it is supposed to be a complement I don't think it is a very good comparison.  I find the focus speed of DSLRs has most to do with what lens you have on.  There are some lenses that focus slowly on even a D3.  All of the lenses I have used on the GH1 focus very quickly except the 45-200mm.  That lens tends to be my slowest.  Non of the lenses I have focus as fast as a 70-200mm f/2.8 but the rest of them focus as fast if not faster than any of the other Nikon lenses I own.  The best I can say about this is that you won't notice the focus speed on the GH2 as it is fast enough to get out of your way.Smaller lighter camera - I recently went on a trip to Egypt and carried nothing but my Panasonic gear.  Two camera bodies, 5 lenses, 1 flash, an iPad, and camera bag.  Total weight 10lbs (3lbs of that was the bag itself).  My Nikon D300 and 14-24mm lens would have weight more just by themselves (I was carrying the Panasonic 7-14mm so I did have wide covered)Swivel Screen with full-time live view - You won't know what you are missing until you become used to this and how well it works.  Want to reach up as high as you can and shoot down;  No problems.  Want to get as low as possible but can't lay down in the mud or water; No problem.  Want to take a picture of you and your daughter but there is nobody around; No problem.  Turn the screen around aim the camera at you and use the screen to frame.  Something that makes photos interesting is showing the viewer something from a perspective they don't often see.  The swivel screen actively encourages this.  The other thing the swivel screen does is make shooting from a tripod a joy.  Because of how small and light this camera is you can use a much smaller tripod.  I have a 3lb tripod that can support 7lbs.  Also, you can now set you camera up in all sorts of whacky positions and just rotate the screen to be able to frame and focus.  Very nice.  Also, with no mirror to flip up you don't have to worry about any vibrations.Touch Focus implemented as slick as on the iPhone.  As I mentioned above you can shoot from many strange angles because you can swivel the screen to almost any angle.  However, if the camera did not focus on what you wanted it would be hard to change it.  Now you can simply touch the screen on what you want to focus and presto it will focus on that.  The GH2 is worth the price just for that.WYSIWYG - What you see is what you get.  Since you are looking at either the screen or the beautiful EVF, you are seeing what the sensor sees.  With a DSLR you are seeing what the lens sees.  This is an important difference.  If you forgot to reset your WB or Aperture or any camera setting, you will see it before you shoot.  On a DSLR you would have no idea until you looked at the pictures.  Also, if it is a low light situation, the EVF will start to noise up and start to lose some of its smoothness.  This is a warning to you that you need to use flash or a tripod.  With a DSLR the viewer becomes darker but you don't get a very good visual cue of how your camera is seeing it.  For me the most brilliant thing with WYSIWYG is setting exposure.  Because I can see what the camera is doing with exposure, I usually leave the camera in P mode.  Then I change the exposure by changing where I aim the camera, lock the exposure and then reframe for the subject.  It works something like this.  I am trying to take a picture of a person but the exposure is picking up to many bright objects, thereby dimming my subject.  So, I aim the camera to include more dark areas while keeping my subject in the shoot.  Then I press the shutter release button down half way to lock the exposure and focus.  Then I reframe back to the original photo.  This works so quickly you can try several exposures in less time than you could set one with the exposure compensation dial (which is actually exceedingly well executed on this camera also.)  In a DSLR, since you don't see the exposure, you are just basically guessing at what you want and then shooting, view the photo and fix.  Much slower.Shoot about any lens you want - The distance from the lens to sensor is so short, that with the appropriate adaptor, you can put just about any lens you want on this camera. Canon, Nikon, Leica, Voigtlander, Pentax, Sony, you can use them all.  Generally you need to use lenses which have aperture rings. Additionally, you do lose autofocus but there are many instances where this just doesn't matter.  Macro photography is a good example.  You can fit a Nikon 200mm f/4 onto the GH2 and then either get a 2:1 reproduction or a 1:1 reproduction with twice the depth of field.  It is like putting on a teleconverter without the loss of light and depth of field.  Brilliant.Great for Newbies - All DSLRs are easy for anyone to use and the GH2 is no exception.  The great handling makes the GH2 better for newbies in my opinion.  Anyway, all you have to do is put the camera into iA mode and start shooting.  This camera gets the subject correct more often then not and will make you look good.  In dynamic situation, I actually use the iA mode quite a bit.  I do this because the camera is good a recognizing as scene as a person, flower, scenery, etc.  The camera then instantly sets numerous setting to make that scene look as good as possible.  If you tried to do it yourself it could take a few minuets to set and then a few to set back.  Or even worse you forget to reset it and you next pictures look bad.  If I have time, then I will set the camera myself.  My daughter has been using the GH1 since she was 2.  Here hit rate initially was only about 10% usable picture and 1% good pictures.  Her hit rate now is about 70% usable pictures and 20% good pictures with about 5% really nice pictures.  She has such a different perspective that it is really interesting to see how she views the world.Image Quality - I am reluctant to put this in the review because all modern cameras have such good IQ that it really is not relevant in most cases and any discussion encourages pixel peeping instead of photo making.  I will say, if you are using this camera to make pictures to view on your monitor, or publish on the web, or print 8x10s this camera will more than meet your needs and if you do your part make some really nice photos.  The GH1 has been my go to camera for the past two years and I have made some amazing pictures with it.  The GH2 is better.  You can argue the merits of FX vs DX vs M4/3 until you are blue in the face but the fact of the matter is it just doesn't matter in todays age and each year it continues to matter less and less.  All cameras have their limitations and part of being a good photographer is know what those are and shooting around them.  As far as ISO goes, with the GH1, ISO 800 was the highest I would shoot except in an emergency.  With the GH2, ISO 1600 shoots clean (better than 800 on GH1) and 3200-6400 are perfectly usable.Stills while shooting Video - The GH1 would not let you take a still photo while shooting video.  The GH2 allows you to take a 14mp 16x9 picture while shooting video.  So now you can be taking video and when you see something you want a still photo of just press the shutter release and now you have a photo.  Brilliant.5 fps full 16mb resolution and 40fps 4mp pictures for up to 1 second - Here is a feature I have not really seen anyone talking about.  This camera has become a fantastic sports camera.  It will shoot full resolution at 5 fps which is pretty pedestrian but still more than adequate for most sporting events.  The 7D and A55 shoot 7 and 10 respectively.  However, the GH2 pulls a trick out of its hat with an electronic shutter that will shoot 4mp pictures 40fps for up to 1 second.  Now for those of you who think 4mp is yesterdays news.  That is a 2400x1600 size photo.  That is good enough to print a 12x8 photo from.  Combine this with the fantastic new 100-300mm lens and you can shoot 40fps at 200-600mm equivalent.  Wow.I can go on and on but this review is getting too long already.  Some of the features I haven't talked about are Aspect Bracketing, Advanced Scene Mode, My Color Mode, Film Mode, Face Recognition, Fn1-3 button (Function) and the C1-3 modes (Custom Modes).  You can really tell that someone who enjoys making pictures designed the layout and handling for this camera.  There are not a lot of cameras out there that can make that claim.'What's Not1/4000 top shutter speed and 1/160 flash sync speed -  Panasonic has given us a partial Electronic shutter on the GH2.  They were supposed to have released a full electronic shutter but instead wasted research resources on the fad know as 3D.  A full electronic shutter, as we are likely to see in the GH3, will probably have a shutter speed of 1/16000 and a flash sync speed around 1/2000-1/4000.  Also, it is like to be able to shoot 24+ fps for as long as the card can stand.Construction - The switches are a cheap feeling plastic.  Please panasonic put some nice metal or composite switches on this camera.  I never had it fail on my GH1 but I was always worried and careful of it.  This is a bit of a double edged sword as the current construction keeps the camera very light and as I said I have had no troubles with the GH1.  However, The mode nob rotates too easily.  When I am pulling the camera out of the camera bag I often accidentally rotate the mode nob.Panasonic Flashes are outdated, lacking in multiple features and are heinously expensive.  You may wonder the relevance of this in a camera review but if you seriously want to make nicely lit indoor pictures you are going to want a flash.3 years into M4/3 and we are still missing critical lenses - 12mm f/1.4  25mm f/1.4  45mm f/1.4  35-100mm f/2.8  300mm f/4  300mm f/2.8  1.4/1.7/2.0 Teleconverters.  All MIA.  This and the flashes are the only thing really holding the M4/3 system back as a dominant professional system.  To shoot events and wedding you really need the fast glass for the shallow depth of field and for catching special moments in poor lighting.Conclusion:The GH1 in my opinion was a truly revolutionary camera for its day and was the best all around camera on the planet.  The GH2 continues the revolution and has added some amazing new features such as touch screen, 40fps shooting speeds, ETC mode, hi ISO shooting, and the list just goes on and on.  Frankly, there is not another camera that can even come close to doing all of the things this camera is capable of.  It is the new best all around camera on the planet.Pros:40 fps 4mp shooting for up to 1 secTouch screen focusingBlazing fast auto focus -- twice as fast as the already fast GH-1Clean Pictures up to 1600 ISO -- Same as D700Best video in a combo-cam to dateMost shooting modes of any combo-camETC 2.6x extra crop factor turning your 100-300mm into a 520-1560mm video lensMulti-aspect 18mp (16 mp per aspect) sensorBest M4/3 sensor - delivering clean images at 1600 and useable to 6400 thanks to the 3 venus microprocessors for videoIMHO Pound for pound, dollar for dollar, the best all around camera on the planetCons:Still only 1/160 flash sync speedStill only 1/4000 max shutter speed3D is a Fad -- No one wants to have to find/wear some goofy glasses to watch TV or read a book all of the time.

This means if you don't already own this lens you are faced with a tough decision.  The GH1 with 14-140mm lens is selling for $950-1000.  If you buy the GH1 now and then wait six months to buy the GH2 body, you should be able to get that for around $700 at that time.  Then you would have two superb cameras for only $200 more than the GH2 system today.  The downside is, while the GH1 is still a great camera it is not in the league of the GH2.  If you do opt for this system, then the sister lens is the 100-300mm lens.  This would give you a 35mm equivalent coverage of 28mm-600mm with only 2 lenses.  Very very nice.Panasonic GH2 with 14-42This is the system that I bought simply because the body only was not available when I ordered.  The 14-42 is probably Panasonic's worst lens.  Optically it is fine but the construction is not up to the standards of Panasonic's other lenses.  I would avoid this combo and buy the GH1 with the 14-140 lens for the same price as this camera.  Then down the road buy the GH2 body only or wait for the GH2 body only.  If you are just burning to have a GH2, and you only have $1000 to spend then you can still set up a good system.  Get this, and the 45-200mm lens for a total of $1300.  Those two lenses cover you from 28-400mm and should serve just about every need.Panasonic GH2 Body OnlyGreat for anyone who already has M4/3 lenses or anyone just wanting to shoot with Leica lenses.Video Purchasing ThoughtsBuy the GH2--period dot.

Steven's comment that it, \"offers a devastating combination of quality and portability\" is EXACTLY right!* The image quality is great. Better than some dSLRs and very very close to others. (I'm talking you have to blow up the image very, very large and \"pixel peep\" to find the differences) and certainly MUCH better than a \"point and shoot\".* The focus is super fast* The size and weight of the camera is nice - it is light weight* The 3-inch Free-Angle Touch Screen LCD is a great convenience* LOVE that it has a viewfinder too!!* Video is great and easy to use* Super easy to use right out of the box - set it on Auto or Intelligent Auto if you need to and go* Flexibility to use Manual, or any of the other modesI have a dSLR camera and sometimes you just want something lighter to carry around but still get amazing photos. This does the trick! My first test is to put it on auto mode and start clicking to see what it does. Well I got some amazing quality photos before I even really knew how to use this camera. (See some of the samples I uploaded here.) Of course, the more you use your camera and learn about it, the better the two of you will be together. And, the nice thing about being able to get great photos on Auto if you want to use that setting is that you can give it to your spouse or mom or dad or \"non photo\" family member and they can still get great pictures and enjoy taking those pictures.I've used the 45-200mm and 7-14mm lenses on this and they are excellent choices. I would love it if the 45-200mm had a little faster aperture but then it would probably be heavier and more expensive.I'm not sure you can get better than this camera unless you want to invest thousands and thousands of dollars in a dSLR and the very expensive and very heavy bag of professional prime lenses and then be willing to lug all of that stuff around with you all of the time. The fantastic bonus in all of this is awesome video. I'm not that into video  (yet) - I just want to take nice quality videos right out of the box of special moments with friends, family or on vacation. You can do that with the video - and with the still photography with this camera. You can also \"grow into\" it if you want to learn more about either.So, to sum it up - the more I use this camera, the more I like it - and I liked it a lot after my first use. If you want to step up from a point and shoot or just lighten the load down from a dSLR I highly recommend the GH2.", "Date": "February 7, 2011"}, {"Title": "Sweet and Short, best around", "Author": "Jimbo", "ReviewID": "R3M6SKAIMHDX1K", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I could write pages and pages analyzing each feature of the GH2, but that's been done.  This camera has two big interest groups: cinematographers, and photographers (still photos, that is).  Read the section more pertaining to you, bearing in mind that I'm a still photographerPHOTOGRAPHERS:great performance.  Great depth and everything.Some of the things less advertised:-Lots of in-camera photo editing (pre-shot) so you can set +contrast, -Sat, and B&W; to see what the final image will look like, before ever putting it on the computer.  I use it to see if the effect I'm going for will work.  Also, built in \"films\" that are great for different looks on your photos, each one equatable to a LR plugin or preset.  Things like smooth, vivid, etc.-Zoom in for manual focus.  I really love this when I'm using a tripod for Macro work and my depth of focus is ~.5mm  I can get a real close up look at the subject and get that amazingly sharp spot-on focus that everyone loves-The dials.  I think they're underrated.  I can go from facial tracking to spot focus to multi-area without taking my eye off the subject.  I can change focus modes, turn on burst, set a timer, all that without taking my eye out of the viewfinder.  I love that.-The AF/AE Lock.  If you don't have this on your current camera, you're missing out.  It's great for exposing shots into the sun.  Point up a bit, set the lock, then focus on a lower subject, pop flash, and then you've got a great shot in a high-dynamic-range environment without any post-processing, bracketing, or setup.-The settings screen.  Many people are going to use the LCD for taking pictures.  I use the viewfinder, so I then set the LCD to a settings screen showing white balance settings, exposure settings, and all the other settings like bracketing and EC, focus modes, drive mode, saving mode etc.etc.etc.  It's the info shown on the live-view screen, but you can edit it all with a tap and a spin of the dial, instead of navigating the quick menu.  And it's in big shiny boxes, real pretty to look at too.-Lots of other random stuff.  I'd take way too long to explain it all.  Don't listen to the haters, this camera is great.  Don't listen to dSLR evangelists, EVIL (Electronic viewfnder & interchangeable lens) cameras can stand up next to them.  It's all about how you use it.Compared to a friend's T3i, the GH2 is much smaller, more compact, less chunky.  The T3i has about 200ISO better noise performance, but both produce good images at ISO3200 (not that I got that high regularly).  Gh2 has faster focusing, but less accurate low-light focusing.  Interesting fact, the Gh2 will not focus on a solid white wall without the focus light.  Just tossing that out, even though nobody really does that.  The 14-42 kit lens is the same as a T3i's 18-55 kit lens.  Oh and the GH2 is 158032^152 times more fun and user friendly to use xD.  More awesome auto mode.  I haven't found a way to repurpose the record button, so I think you'll just always have a random video button.  Oh well, I'm not using it.The GH2 has a M4/3 sensor (obviously) so the focal length multiplier is 2x. So at 14mm, your \"zoom\" will be about he same as a 35mm camera at 28mm.  So don't bother getting a 50mm lens, that's basically what the kit lens is (14mm<25mm<42mm).A note of warning, advanced functions -are- possible, but some are a little hidden.  One is custom WB.  You have to set the display to the settings screen, then choose WB and then \"adjust\" and you can set 4 custom WB settings to use later (gray card or manual adjust).  Some other things are a little hidden like this, you just have to google what you're trying to do.Slave flashes are hard to set up, as is high-sync.  Doesn't tether to a laptop well, either.  Can't use an external device control it (Canon has a EOS utility for PC's and Mac's).  A few things like this come out of it being built as a video camera first, then a photography camera - or, it seems that way at least.The 2.5mm port is great for remote shutters, I have a 2.5Ghz wireless one set up right nowScreen is nice and brightness is auto-adjusted.  I've never noticed it being very dark or bright relative to my conditions, it's always about right.The LVF/LCD switch is set to \"high\" out-of-box, but I found that it would often switch while I was using the touch screen, so I moved it to \"low\". It's a little slower but seems more intent-accurate.  Btw, I love the switch.  Very useful, saves lots of battery.Swapping batteries is super easy, I can do it in 5 seconds flat from looking in the viewfinder to looking into it again.  7 seconds flat Picture>>swap>>picture.  That was with the battery on my desk.  Obviously it would take a bit longer from your pocket, but the point is that the camera isn't the hold up.All in all, I really love this camera.  I've used it for macro, landscape, portraits, HDR, Focus stacking, just about everything.  And it's small and light enough to not get in the way.  It feels sturdy though, probably ABS plastic.Anyways, I hope you get the point: Buy it.  Support the revolution and treat yourself while doing it.  If you don't get this, the T4i is the next step up in my opinion.  It came out a few months after I got my GH2, though.  It's got all the Canon support and backing that draws lots of people.  The Rebel line is sort of the iPhone of cameras, lol.CINEMATOGRAPHERS:I can't talk much about this becuase it's not my field, but I get suuuuper high quality videos that come out great.  Great bitrates built in.  Full HD of course, and lots of format options.  I understand there are hacks for higher bitrates, none of which I intend to use.Focus pulling isn't beautiful with the kit lens and tap-to-focus.  It works really nicely, but isn't a smooth transition--it looks more like a camera focusing :)Other things like power zooming would all be from some other lens.  Check that the lens you want is made for M4/3 cameras.  The 5DmkIII has a better selection of lenses, but it's also more than double the cost.  I've seen this camera used professionally, in some documentaries and newscasts.  It's a great lightweight and super portable camera that doesn't sacrifice quality.  Movies look great at ISO12,800.  Dynamic range is a little less than a full-frame, but that's to be expected.", "Date": "August 22, 2012"}, {"Title": "GH2 is everything I hoped it would be!", "Author": "grumpygranny", "ReviewID": "R13HXUBMV4GNQW", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "First off, when I ordered this item I wasn't expecting to get the GH2k, which is the European version. It only shoots in 1080i, not 1080p. I don't really care though, because when it comes down to it, 99% of a video/still's quality comes from the photographer and lens.AnywayThis camera body has extremely impressive quality. I love how tiny and lightweight it is! Because of the mu43 sensor, it needs a lot more light than other DSLRs to function professionally, but it also has next to no moire. It's a worthy trade off because you're supposed to use lights anyway. The colors I can get out of this thing are absolutely stunning. I can crank the iso up to 800 without a single pixel of grain, and it only gets super grainy after 2000. Paired with the 20mm 1.7 lens, this camera shoots cinema quality. I recommend shooting all of your videos and stills very neutral so that you have more to work with when you get to a computer.Speaking of computers, the program that comes with the camera to edit and manage pictures is fabulous. I compared it's power to photoshop and there was no contest- the factory software blew everything else out of the water.I give the interface 10 out of 10 for being intuitive and efficient. You can set all of the function buttons to different actions depending on what you need to adjust the most. It has a gazillion useful features, seriously.----------The kit lens is not bad, especially if you leave it at 14mm. It's nice and sharp, and has awesome autofocus/OIS. If you zoom to 45mm, it becomes very difficult to get enough light.There are not as many lenses on the market for mu43 cameras. I tried adapting a 28mm zeiss, but it's so dark and the DOF is so shallow that I can barely use it for stills. Do some snooping around to find a nice mu43 lens, and you're all set.THIS CAMERA IS ABSOLUTELY BEAUTIFUL.", "Date": "April 27, 2011"}, {"Title": "Great for shooting video", "Author": "David M. Comfort \"CEO of OneWorldWiki.com\"", "ReviewID": "R37UDBKDPO2BLH", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "The GH2 has been wonderful for shooting video. The last two years have seen an explosion in HDSLR/cinema DSLR or however you want to call it. The GH2 is a major step in allowing prosumers to shoot high definition cinema-style video. It is not without its challenges, but the GH2 will give you the most bang for the buck in shooting high-quality video.There are several excellent reviews of this camera already so I will just say that if you want to shoot video using a DSLR (although technically not a DSLR since it does not have a mirror), then the GH2 is a serious contender and is the camera to get at this price point. The autofocus in video mode is nice but generally you will not want to use auto-anything while shooting video.There are several really good lens available for this camera, especially the Voightlander 25mm/f0.95 (if you can find it!). Also, you can view the levels for the built-in stereo mic (although you are going to want to use an external audio recording device anyway).The Extra-Tele convert mode is pretty awesome. \"When shooting in 1920X1080 HD (including 24P Cinema mode) and when ETC mode is engaged, the GH2's 4608 x 3456 sensor is \"cropped\" to 1920X1080. In other words, only the central 2 Megapixels of the sensor's overall 18 Megapixels is recorded... As a consequence, any lens put on the GH2 when shot in ETC video mode has an effective focal length of 2.6X of what's marked on the barrel. The new 100-300mm zoom therefore becomes a 260-780mm, with no loss of light!\" See [...] for more info.Also, Look at Philip Bloom's (one of the pioneer's of DSLR filmmaking) write-up of the GH2 at [...] and a video he shot at [...]Philip Bloom seems to swear by the GH2 and is using it more and more. From his review:PROS: Great image, great 24p mode. Minimal moire and rolling shutter, live HDMI out and clean! Manual audio with live meters, articulating screen, improved EVF. No recording limit in non EU versions. 1:1 mode is awesome, good touch screen. Internal stereo mic not too bad. Has the best auto focus video system out there!CONS: 25p where are you?

It was surprising to see that somebody gave three stars to this camera after just a 15 minute comparison with Canon 60D and making a conclusion based primarily on how the camera sits in someone's hand. This camera does not deserve such a \"quick\" evaluation and adding another point of view should help others get a more objective picture.First of all, yes, I would agree about the smaller grip on this camera comparing to Canon Digital Rebel that I own. However, if one is concerned about the quality of products (pictures, videos) from the camera, one would consider many other factors than just a grip. Plus, a smaller grip can always be enlarged, but a larger grip cannot be made smaller. While traveling every gram will pull you down, hence it's understandable that the designers of this camera left ideas of adding some bulk up to the owners and it is wise.I've owned Canon Digital Rebel for approximately six years and was using it not because I was inspired by the tool, but because I did not have an alternative. Panasonic GH2 inspires me to capture videos and take photos because qualitatively speaking I like the final product and that what all it matters. Who cares about the grip size of about the proportion of plastic in the camera's body? Speaking about plastic... Yes, when zooming in and out it feels that the parts are going \"plastic and plastic\", but I am rarely zooming in and out during videos. If it will be important for me, I'll consider purchasing a lens with powerzoom Panasonic Lumix G X Vario PZ 14-42mm/F3.5-5.6 Lens for Panasonic Lumix G-Series Digital Cameras, specifically designed for video shooting. When I was buying this camera, a body-only option was going for the same price as the kit, so did not make sense to buy body-only.By the way, some people have mentioned that they are concerned about the built of this camera. I am not sure how long will last, but my Canon Digital Rebel had to go to service twice for fixing. Once during first 12 months and another time in it's second year. The shutter mechanism is supposed to last 100,000 pictures, but stopped working somewhere around 4,000-5,000. Not sure about Canon's products for professionals, but I'll keep some distance from their consumer products for a while.It appears that the price for this camera has increased during last five weeks. Either it's because the sale is over now or because Panasonic has made an updated firmware available on December 7th, 2011 and in turn the demand has increased. Among some fixes the updated firmware now offers a 1080/30p option (HBR at 24Mbit/s) versus 24p and 30i that this camera was limited to before December 7th.By the way, while choosing a camera, one should remember not only about the controls and quality, but also about what happens with post-production and how much time post-production can take. If you will be getting only .MOV (QuickTime) video files from a photo camera, think about how much time it can take to convert them in order to burn a Blu-ray video disc. This camera captures video in AVCHD format that can be immediately played on a Panasonic, Sony, and some other Blu-ray players without any conversion. Many Panasonic Blu-ray players and TVs have an SDHC reader built in which makes it fast and convenient to check the quality of photos and videos without transferring to a PC and burning discs. In my case using a Panasonic Blu-ray player seemed to be faster at reading 14 Megapixel photos than a Panasonic TV, but the most recent models of Panasonic TVs are most likely better equipped.For those who are interested in technical details... If you will be using a 32GB SDHC card in this camera it should be enough for approximately 3 hours and 3 seconds of HBR (High-Bit Rate) video at 1080/30p. The camera comes with a free/bundled program that will allow you to burn HD video to a DVD-R (clips with no more than 18Mbit/s) or BD-R media (24Mbit/s is OK), therefore you don't need to buy a separate disc burning program. Since there is no conversion while burning video discs with AVCHD files, these discs can be used for both purposes: for archiving original video and for watching that video without spending extra time for authoring. Hopefully this information will help those who are proactive and think about their video production workflow ahead of time.", "Date": "January 22, 2012"}, {"Title": "Woo Hoo!! I'm happy.

I'm going to review this camera from my own perspective as a \"PROtographer\". OK, I'm not really in the business of taking photos for money - I do it as a hobby, but that doesn't mean I don't like getting top-notch results!The Lumix GH2 is an evolution built upon the already-excellent Lumix GH1...but it's more than a name revision with a few bullet-points added to the package. The GH2 combines ultra-sharp still photos with fluid, detailed HD video capabilities. You no longer need a separate device for photos and video - the GH2 does it all and does it better than most other products on the market. If you were looking for the \"god device\" of digital imaging, the GH2 is it (at least until the GH3 is available).Still Pictures---------------Most SLR-class cameras take excellent pictures. The megapixel wars of the early years are less relevant today, because we've come to a point where things like dynamic range and sensor quality are what make the difference. I shoot pictures using a combination of JPG+RAW, so for every picture I have a RAW file I can use to make post-processing adjustments. I try to get things as close to the desired end-result as I can using the camera, but it's not always possible or practical to do so. What I can say is that the GH2 has a great sensor that does an excellent job of capturing fine detail. My \"post processing\" rarely involves more than moderate adjusting saturation and levels until the picture looks good to me. If you want more simplistic functionality, using the \"intelligent auto\" feature does the trick in most conditions.Video---------------The GH2 shoots HD video using the AVCHD codec, the same video format used by BluRay discs. You have 1080i / 30 fps, 720p / 60 fps and 1080p / 24 fps. The most practical modes are 720p and 1080p, however the low frame rate of the 1080p mode means it's not ideal for fast-action unless you want a lot of motion blur. I would have liked a 1080p @ 30 or 60 FPS and that would have been my go-to mode...that being said, I've been shooting most of my video in 1080/24 due to the awesome detail it captures. I don't mind the \"film like\" motion effect...in fact I think it adds a touch of character to the videos.The GH2 is very sharp - even without any kind of in-camera processing. Both pictures and videos will be super sharp with fine detail easily visible. If you have a high-quality TV or monitor, you will be amazed at the level of detail captured in video. Pausing any frame could even fool you into thinking you are looking at a still picture - it's THAT good.Audio---------------Along with the AVC format, the camera records sound using dolby digital stereo. Despite the small size of the microphones, the sound quality is quite good with distinct channel separate (i.e. the sound is not all mushed together as if it were mono). It's not like having a dedicated microphone, but it gets a wide dynamic range of sound - from lows to highs, so your videos will sound just like you remember them.Lenses---------------I have the 20mm and 14-140mm Lumix lenses. Both of them are great and I'm not going to review lenses here, other than to say that lens selection is the one of the few drawbacks to the M4/3 camera format. That being said, I have been able to take some great shots in a variety of situations with just these two lenses alone. The next lens I plan to get is the Lumix wide angle.Weight and Build---------------The GH2 body is light, and with the smaller lenses you would barely notice it around your neck. This also makes the GH2 very tripod-friendly, since you don't need a 15 lb tripod to steady it. I have a Manfrotto 190PROB tripod which weighs in around 7 lbs including the head. No problem carrying the camera around mounted to the tripod so I can quickly take pictures as opportunities present themselves without having to set-up and break-down the equipment each time. Holding the GH2 is comfortable. It has a solid feel, allowing you to hold it steady. It's diminutive size is also unobtrusive, so you can capture pictures without getting odd stares from people wondering why you are taking their picture.Overall Thoughts---------------Obviously I like this camera and I agree with the other reviewer who said it's the best \"all around\" camera you can get. Its few flaws are easily overcome by its sheer versatility and image-quality. The GH2 is a pleasure to use and it has really made me enjoy photography again. I love taking pictures everywhere I go with this camera - it's a great creative outlet.

Although I am fairly new to the DSLM (i.e. Digital Single Lens Mirrorless) world, I do already own a few Panasonic Lumix products including the GH2, the GX1, and the GF3 plus six Lumix lenses: 14-42 kit, 14 pany, 20 pany, 25mm, 14-42 GX, and the 45-175 GX.  For those shoppers that are uncertain about not only the GH2 but whether to go with DSLM cameras or DSLR cameras, in general, the DSLM cameras are significantly lighter (bodies and lenses), are better tailored to video shooting, and arguably are a better value for hybrid shooting compared to DSLR.  If you are still unsure then I highly recommend going to YouTube and search DSLM versus DSLR then the Lumix GH2.After owning my GH2 for two months I can confidently say that I am impressed with the quality of the still images especially for the pictures produced with shallow depth-of-field shots.  The video capabilities which is one of the primary reasons I went with the GH2 and the DSLM set up blows away all my prior camcorders in all aspects except the auto-focus.  By that I mean that the video quality, low light performance, and video control options all appear to far exceed similarly (or even higher) priced camcorders.  For me the slower auto-focus, when compared to camcorders, actually has taught me to hold and pan the camera more steady for better viewing videos.There are great deals for the GH2 now on Amazon since Panasonic recently released the GH3.  However, due to the size/weight plus price differences between these two cameras I do not consider the comparison apples-to-apples at least for now.  The GH3 body is about 24% heavier than the GH2 and currently costs more than double the GH2.  Even though I will likely buy the heavier GH3 in the future, the GH2 is almost a no brainer to buy now due to it's relatively light weight portability and value.  It is already a proven and tested product.In summary, I highly recommend the GH2.  It is an ease to carry with the body (including SD card and battery) weighing only 15.66 ounces!  As a side note the GX1 is also an excellent contender with a sturdy high quality body weighing at 11.22 ounces (including SD card and battery).  However, the GH2 has better video capabilities shooting up to 1920x1080, 30p, 24Mbps (un-hacked) as opposed to the GX1 shooting up to 1920x1080, 30p, 20Mbps, and the GH2 has the built-in excellent Electronic View Finder which is great for better photo composition and almost a necessity for bright light outdoor shooting.  I have the GH2 as my primary hybrid camera with the GX1 as my secondary back-up camera.", "Date": "December 25, 2012"}, {"Title": "Great Handling, Great Image Quality, Nice Size", "Author": "EK", "ReviewID": "R3ETPR419EXRUD", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I have been shooting professionally since the 1990s. Most of my camera bodies have been Canon, and my most recent ones have been Canon 5D MkII, of which I own and still use two. The Canon 5D MkII (\"5d2\") is an excellent camera, capable of fantastic results, and while it's considered to be 'compact' compared to other professional bodies (Canon 1Ds MkIV, Canon 1Dx, Nikon D4, etc), it's still quite cumbersome to carry. Even the consumer oriented Canon and Nikon camera bodies can be quite heavy, especially when carrying more than one lens.Enter the micro four thirds format (m43). Early in its history, image quality was decent but left lots to be desired. Lens selection was poor. They were slow to focus and respond. And they were expensive for what they were.m43 today is an entirely different story. Fast, compact, a respectable range of lens choices, and reaonably priced. And while not up to producing image quality of full-frame dSLRs, it can certainly hold it's own against many dSLRs with APS sized sensors (Canon 7D, 60D, Nikon D7000, Canon G1X, Sony NEX series, etc).I owned an Olympus EPL1 for some time, and felt that the image quality was quite good, especially for the compact size. Now that I own a GH2, all I can say is WOW!!! The GH2 is fast and responsive, and the 16MP sensor is a huge improvement over the 12MP EPL1. Sure the GH2 is a little bigger than the EPL1, but it's negligible. Plus the GH2 is much nicer to hold, and I have small hands. Go to the camera size website and see for yourself (google it; amazon doesn't allow links).The GH2 is a winner in many ways. The video is produces is pro-quality. Many independent filmmakers have turned to the GH2 for its 'film-like' quality. Search around on Vimeo and see some of the GH2 footage for yourself. Clearly AMAZING.The best thing about the m43 format is it's size. Especially the lenses. Many of my most used Canon lenses weigh anywhere from 1 to 3 POUNDS! The heaviest m43 lens I own weighs a few OUNCES. Check out the various pancake lenses out there.I used to use my Canon gear for 100% of my professional work. Since getting the GH2, I only use the Canon gear for about 70% of my professional work. As I get more m43 lenses and a lighting system, that percentage will surely shrink to the 50% range. For my non-professional work (travel, social snaps, etc), the GH2 is my go-to camera. It's such a JOY to use.", "Date": "December 10, 2012"}, {"Title": "I use this more than my Canon 60D & L lenses.", "Author": "David A. Morehead", "ReviewID": "RUQI5TCM5POO5", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I have had this camera for over a year now. When I first got it I wasn't into video very much. I mostly took pics. This camera is Ok for pics but it really shines for video. I bought it to be able to have a small camera and lens to take with me when I am out walking around for 5-6 hours at a time. I do not like carrying my heavy 60D with heavy lenses for long periods of time.These are the things I love about this camera...Small/LightVideo quality and video file sizes (much smaller files than my Canon 60D)The 60D video files are so big that they crashed my video editing program. It ran out of memory too quickly. With the Panasonic file sizes I can load lots of videos and make longer movies without running out of memory.Video optionsElectronic viewfinder (lets you display three different types of grids to help you align your shots)Live histogram so you can easily see if your shot is exposed properly. It turns a different color (yellow) when you have a good exposure.When you start to manual focus it magnifies the area 10xs (in the viewfinder or the back screen) so you can get focus perfect very easily. Try doing that with a camera that has a mirror. (You would have to use live view (back screen only) to get this functionality)You can get over double the amount of zoom in video with one press of a button. The quality is very good! I use it all the time. It allows you to get a more zoom from any lens without any loss of quality! This is an amazing feature that is kind of hidden in the manual. Panasonic should be using this as one of their main selling points!I bought the new 14-45 power zoom and it is much sharper (and smaller) than the kit lens.Ability to mage jpgs from any video frame. You can capture the exact moment you want. The quality is excellent. I think it is 2 megs. That is almost enough resolution to get a good 8x10. Perfect for getting shots of things that happen in an instant. Lightning, etc...Auto focus during videoDecent stereo mic for videoMovable display to get pics and videos from any angle. Makes ground and over the head shots effortless!! It encourages you to try new perspectives.Looks like a cheap camera (I know, this should be a bad thing) so you can take it places where pro gear is not allowed. You can go amost unnoticed while taking video and you can get pro results!!Lots of buttons on the outside of the camera so you don't have to go hunting through menus to find things.Programmable buttons so you can set up the camera to how you like to work.You can quickly change where you want to focus by pressing anywhere on the back screen. You can quickly reset the focus to the middle by pressing a button.Things I don't like...Variable aperture lens. Changes focus and light level when you zoom during video.Takes too long to be able to shoot video when starting up the camera. I have missed a lot of good moments waiting for the camera to be ready for video. It takes abut three seconds to be able to start shooting video when you turn it on.Overall, I have been thrilled with this camera. I wish they made a full frame version.

Looking back, I can tell that getting this camera was the most exciting thing I did in my video and photo \"career\". My GH2 replaced both Sony HDR-FX7 and Nikon D90 for me. That combo cost three and a half grands and weighted about 6 pounds together. I paid fifteen hundred for this thing (along with 14-140mm lens) and even with a zoom lens it had never been heavier than 2 pounds. As I discovered the joy of using fast prime lenses this camera got even lighter and more compact in my hands and on my neck.As a camcorder replacement this camera was awesome: larger sensor and interchangeable lenses completely changed my videos. Larger sensor allows for much better low light performance and also for very shallow depth of field especially when combined with a fast lens. My first fast lens was Panasonic 20 mm f1.7. I liked it a lot and very soon it was followed by a 12 mm f2.0 and 45 mm f1.8 Zuiko lenses. Finally I've got a 25 mm f1.4 lens which replaced my 20 mm lens I started with. My 14-140 mm lens has been sitting in the drawer for quite some time and I'd better sell it soon because there is no way for me to get back to f4.0 after seeing what f2.0 or even f1.4 can do.As my D90 replacement this camera also worked quite well. Honestly, I was so excited about its video capabilities my stills took the back seat for quite a while. But as I started getting into those fast primes (especially, the 45 mm portrait lens) my taste to still photos got back.This year all major camera producers came up with new or updated full frame models: Canon 5D mark iii and 6D, Nikon D800 and D600, and Sony A99. That was very very tempting to make the next step and see where a full frame camera will take me. I spent several days agonizing about which camera I should get, but could not make my mind. Compactness is a big thing for me as I bring my camera when I go backpacking, but I would not mind extra weight if everything else was right.The problem is non of these super expensive full frame monsters seem to be perfect: D800 is stuffed with those stupid megapixels which diminish its low light performance (I would be so happy if they just kept the MP count at 12). Canon mark iii over saturates red and Phillip Bloom says that it's footage is quite crappy unless it is sharpened in post production. Sony A99 did not seem to do well in video at all (even though it seemed like it was trying to do what Panasonic did with GH2, but at a more advanced level).Another annoying thing about Canon and Nikon DSLRs is the lack of articulated screens. I've got very used to having it on my GH2 even when taking stills. I believe that any LCD screen should be articulated because it is not such a big deal technically and this is so much more convenient. Some people say they solve this problem by buying those external LCD monitors. Another pound of weight and more wires? No, thank you very much! If Sony A99 produced decent video and did not cost a fortune I would probably go with it just because of its flip out screen.Rolling shutter is still a problem on all those high end cameras..Simply put, I could not find a well rounded DSLR that would look \"perfect\" and justify the price and bulk of a full frame camera. And these are not trivial matters: everything seems to triple when you move to a full frame DSLR. Even worse, it is not just the camera body itself: the same thing applies to lenses.In the end I got back to my GH2, figured out how to tweak its white balanced settings to make look it more \"canon-like\" (not as greenish-brownish) and it seems like I will be a happy camper at least for some time with my GH2. Also, to improve quality of my stills I decided to start taking pictures in RAW and edit them in Lightroom 4.0.I am not a micro two thirds (MFT) fan boy - the full frame system enchants me, but after reading a lot about MFT vs FF I figured that there is nothing wrong about sensors getting smaller as technology gets more advanced. The only limitation which can not be overcome by advances in technology is the shallower depth of field of larger sensors. But Panasonic and Olympus seem to have figured out that the MFT is the sweet spot in terms of sensor size. I can confirm that one still can get a very decent shallow DOF by using a large aperture lens with relatively long focal length. My 25 mm f1.4 and 45 mm f1.8 do a very good job in this regard.I will be waiting for the GH3 to come out and most likely that will be my next upgrade. No sexy full frame toy for me :( I envy those people who will be buying GH2 at the half of the price I paid 1.5 years ago and discovering the beauty of this camera just like I did in this year and a half!", "Date": "December 10, 2012"}, {"Title": "Best camera.", "Author": "Mahesh Lakkaraju", "ReviewID": "R15PZSQ7I8MLJV", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "For the price, there is no single camera that can beat the features of this camera.

For me, the GH2 is the better choice - 16MP is plenty of resolution and, up to ISO 800, noise is very low. ISO 800 is my upper limit, not so much to handle low light levels, but to allow a reasonable shutter speed when using the very slow Lumix zoom lenses.  The GH2 is my 2nd camera, one I carry in the car all the time and on trips where I don't feel like carrying a DSLR, and it works well for that purpose.  Modest size and weight make it an easy camera to carry.That said, there are 2 things about the camera system that hold it back:1) Lack of a 2nd control dial.  With only 1 control dial, pressing the dial or another button is required to adjust both aperture (or shutter speed, depending on your Mode Dial setting) and exposure compensation for an image.  Aperture, exposure compensation and ISO are the 3 things I'm most likely to change on every image, so this is really inconvenient.  Taking the camera away from your eye, making an exposure adjustment, then reframing the image gets old.2) Lack of in-camera image stabilization.  Panasonic chose to put image stabilization in their lenses.  The problem is, if you want to use the great m43 lenses that Olympus and Sigma are putting out, they didn't follow suit so you won't get stabilization at all.If you would like to try an m43 system to see if this format is for you, the GH2 would be an excellent place to start.  Price should fall even further as launch of the GH3 camera gets closer. Personally, I'm considering the new Olympus OM-D camera because it has 2 control dials and in-camera stabilization.May 2013 Update - after using the GH2 for a year, I find that it consistently underexposes images when left to its own devices.  I shoot in RAW format and have found that I can 'overexpose' 2 stops from what the camera considers to be a normal exposure before I get any blown highlight warning in Adobe Camera Raw; even then the highlights are recoverable.  What I consider a good 'expose-to-the-right' Raw image represents exposure compensation of +1-1/3 to +1-2/3 stops.  That seems like a lot to me; Panasonic must be pathologically afraid of blowing the highlights to have set a normal exposure so dark.As an aside, this observation is based on the image review histogram.  I found the Live View histogram pretty useless in judging exposure.  It is presented in a small square box on-screen and just doesn't have enough X-axis resolution for you to make a judgement on the highlights.", "Date": "May 15, 2012"}, {"Title": "Righteous", "Author": "Alex", "ReviewID": "RSRSF7D8ZQXUD", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "After using the GH2 for a few days, I have found it a rather fascinating camera.

I have used a Lumix DMC G-1 and so I was used to the look and handling of the camera. Panasonic managed to tighten up the mode knob since the earlier model, and the screen touch feature is nicer than I thought it would be; in short some useful small improvements within a successful original design.  The images have good color and good auto white balance and the autofocus does what it is supposed to do, no problems so far.  I can't say this model is completely intuitive, but it is not hard to get the hang of. The manual is a bit overwhelming I agree w others and probably could use a heavy editing and a reorganized product,mainly to sort out things better for quick reference.They gave a lot in the kit but not all you need. Panasonic could have included a patch cord you may need to watch stuff on the TV. Order a HDMI to HDMI mini plug from Amazon, a best buy item from them.  I never go on a trip without a spare battery and it seems they are almost not available and you will have to get on the list to get one from one of the photo dealers. I switched to the older heavier 14-45 lens but the kit one seems to work well enough. With the 20mm 1.7 one can have a small go anywhere camera. Not sure what flash to recommend. I am using the Olympus FL 20 in auto mode and that does well enough but won't be TTL of course.  I tried a budget Fotodiox Canon FD to micro four thirds adapter for my array of FD lenses and I am one (of the few) who did not find it terribly successful, too sloppy and one's gain for me is small and one's loss is too big for the hassle of old lenses on new camera. I need all the automation I can get...  Now, that said this camera makes a good adjunct for an E system Olympus user, like me, since the GH2 works (with some sluggish focus, it strains) on the GH2.  One can't beat the high quality ED Zuiko lenses though if you don't mind the weight add on and the need for Lumix adapter. The 50-200mm SWD is a particularly nice glass even on this baby, since it has a tripod mount, expensive lens but a winner in its class.  Actually the Zuiko 50mm F2 with Panasonic adapter is a nice complement for portraits, still small, the Pana 20mm 1.7 and the 50mm F 2 will carry one far indeed....Panasonic gets a lot of loot seems to me for its accessories and the lens lineup is small at the moment, may count to some if you need a system.Overall, I would say the iA and program modes are exceptionally well implemented and one may get as fancy and artsy as one has the time for or can detect plowing through the brawny manual.  I see that video shooters are already taking to this model which says something for its implementation of HD movies.  ( Check to see if you have the necessary 2.5mm stereo jack for any add on mic not from Panasonic, a nitpic but may call for another  plug adapter, such is life)  Summing up, so far,about one month and counting and I like it so far.-----------------As of June 2011, this has become a fun camera to use when I want to travel light.  I found, to my pleasure, that it will operate fairly well with Olympus ED 4/3 lenses, like the 50-200mm SWD. That lens was designed for a different type of autofocus system than the GH 2,but the designers found a way to make it work on the GH2.  I am getting used to the menu system, which is well laid out and easy to get used to.  I have done some video clips of rain and thunderstorms, good tests to see if the internal stereo microphones are adequate. In my opinion they are. I do not hear the sound of focus motor in my lenses, -though it could be my otic sensitivity or lack thereof.  When I pop the SD card in my Viera Blu Ray player it produces a surprisingly good HD image. And I use the TV to do evaluation of still photos, either from the camera with cord or from the Blu Ray player SD slot.The Lumix 20mm 17 lens is a natural adjunct to this purchase. It makes a compact piece of kit.  Too bad they are selling out so fast...get on the wait list, this one will not be surpassed all that soon. Cost is not cheap, but it does what it says it does. I do use the LCD touch feature more than I thought I would. An acquired taste for the iPAD generation I am thinking...it takes more pressure than the iPAD, different technology involved.  6/15/2011. GSUpdate one year on:  Feb 2012.  I am increasingly impressed by this camera.  The controls seem more logical once you get familiar with them. I am using the touch feature more than I expected.  The ability to assign special menu options to the three FN custom buttons is handy once you decide what you want to access.  The color and resolution are just fine.  It is great to work in almost total darkness and see the gain up in the finder, and in dark close stuff you get a focus spot light.  I also found out, since this camera does not have an infrared remote for shutter that a company called Vello makes a neat radio frequency trigger set with cable for the camera remote socket (also acts as a wired remote vs the Panasonic OEM one btw) with a visible green LED for focus ready and a red confirmation for shutter release.  Very nice and can be adjusted for delayed or multiple shots of you and a group ( to avoid blinks). I set the focus manually for this, but it can easily be programmed to shoot in face recogniton focus mode when getting in the picture or even what it calls \"face recognition.\"  There is a flurry of nice looking mirorless cameras coming down the pike, and I expect Panasonic will upgrade this model as they did the GH-1 ( I believe there is a firmware download to increase the video FRAME RATE fps.  If you need an all around camera of solid thermoplastic construction with a good hand feel and a bright and easy to see eye level finder, I would not hesitate to go with Panasonic. I use the 20mm 1.7 about 80% of the time, but will get something in the 44mm FL range soon.  Not the Leica one which has Lumix name, as I find that Olympus has a more competitive priced one. The micro four thirds system is a neat idea, and I look to see it earn a real place with serious shooters.  If you want pocketable, this is not your baby. Frankly, I have enough trouble managing the cursor OK panel in the center with it's small tabs and my fat fingers. The camera has enough heft and feel for me without getting any smaller. You will be satisfied with the machine when you learn it.  And that means getting the unoffical illustrated manual in the book section.  Clears up things, including multiple terms used by Panasonic in its user guide.  Enjoy it on you next trip, and happy shooting....gsPostscript for tripod users: Some camera user have standardized their tripods to take the Arca Swiss style dovetail plate.  I found one company that has a designed for the GH series one on offer.  It fits with the use of a slight compression pad since the camera base is not totally flat. It works anyway. If you are in the market for a plate for GH 2 try the one by Acratech. Fits and does the job.--------------------As of January 2013, no regrets and no upgrade urge at all. I still consider this GH2 a good buy and a dollar value after the newer hotshot model GH3 now on the street.  I say get a good price  \\deal and use the GH2 for all its assets and not be bothered if lacks WI Fi.I get good shots with this camera and I still enjoy using it. Quibble, it is a modest size camera and buttons are tiny and placement close to hand on right. I have not been able to avoid hitting the durn WB button with my fat fingers , so a little idea\" Consider adding an easy to find Velbon soft vinyl padded palm with nylon strap wrist grip vs neck strap to hold the GH2  Installs on the tripod socket (more or less fits there, i.e. does not keep from using the LCD ),It is a third party generic wrist grip as several companies make them.  Item of low cost but for me strength and utility for this particular camera.The top part of wrist grip strap goes into the camera lug. On the right side for me this adds a certain extra stability and keeps my thumb off to one side and out of harms way to WB button.. For about fifteen dollars it is sure a worth a try.Last thought for now. Lenses are coming but don't expect cheap high speed zooms, silly..I dug really deep into my photo budget and bought the Panasonic 12-35 mm F 2.8 lens, Together  a superb combo if you fancy zooms and if 2.8 is fast enough for you as it ought to be (says he).  The new lens has the quality of best optics and solid performer in real world shooting.Add that zoom  to this nice camera or the GH3 if you insist and you will be as well equipped as the pros in a small package.Now you just need to wait for a good flash gun to get here and it has to be on the way...gs", "Date": "March 29, 2011"}, {"Title": "PROS and CONS", "Author": "Tom o'Bedlam", "ReviewID": "RACHXVPB8ELEY", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "PROS:1. Viewfinder is excellent, clear and the diopter adjustment is good and located where you can't change it accidentally. Big rubber eyecup and the display switches automatically (if you want it to) from LCD to viewfinder when you look through it. It will magnify the image for very accurate focusing. Not having a big, heavy, noisy, battery draining mirror/optical viewfinder like on Canon and Nikon is a HUGE plus. They will abandon that old fossil technology soon.2. Lots of pixels. I'm printing 13x19 and if I use a sharp lens and a tripod the images are as good as the sharpest 6x9. (I got a remote shutter release on Amazon for $5) This camera actually has 18 million pixels: image is 4608, 4752, or 4976 pixels wide depending on which aspect ratio you have selected. The Nikon D4 has only 4,096 or 4928.3. Image stabilization is beyond awesome.4. Shoot in the dark. Set it on ISO 12,800 and use the 1.7 lens and you can photograph when it is so dark you can't hardly see.5. Great video. Stereo sound, and an external stereo microphone jack. Lots of video people are using this camera instead of their camcorders. There's a hack online for even better video.6. Everything is adjustable and/or selectable. If you have the time, you can set up many different custom cameras on this one machine. There is so much versatility on this camera that I won't get to try even half of it in the next several years before I buy the even smarter one that they haven't invented yet.CONS:1. Although you can shoot in the dark, the camera can't focus in the dark. (when out of range of the focus assist lamp) Prefocus and switch to manual.2. You need 2 batteries. The instructions say not to top up the battery frequently or it will start to swell.3. You can use EITHER the remote control OR the external microphone, because they both want to plug into the same jack.Sometimes it's hard having a camera that's way smarter than I am, but mostly we get along really well.", "Date": "July 4, 2012"}, {"Title": "Excellent Video Quality - Good Stills Quality", "Author": "Hazel", "ReviewID": "R3N0V1AO6VXOBO", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This camera is awesome....

I mean Camera", "Author": "OhhWell", "ReviewID": "R38EPMARN7EJA4", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Video production is my profession. My idroduction to photography was in middle school back in the 80s when I learned on a Pentax K1000 (Of Course). I have always owned an SLR and now days DSLR becuase I love the TTL opical Viewfinder and manual controls. I also pretty loyally followed the Minolta line and then Alpha when Sony bought them out. I still own Minolta XD-7 and 800Si film cameras. I say all of that to build the foundation for my initial skepticism about the lcd viewfinder in this camera.Being in video production, I am obviously very used to LCD viewfinders but for a still camera, I was always a firm believer in a good bright optical viewfinder. After owning this camera for a while now, I am starting to change my mind. In this age of digital cameras, a digital LCD viewfinder is making alot of sense. Digital sensors still do not react like film. They clip realy fast and hard on highlights while film will roll off a bit smoother and is more forgiving. The digital viewfinder can give you a great WYSIWYG view of not only depth of field but dynamic range. Of course, if you are shooting RAW you can get away with a bit more but highlight clipping is clipping and for the general shooter using Jpegs out of the camera seeing what the final output will look like is a great aid.Anyway, I bought the camera for its video capabilities which I am still suprised aren't as well known as I would think. It is an amazing little thing. The clarity resolution and image quality that this thing puts out has you wondering if it really is just 8bit 4:2:0 AVCHD. There are hacks available to push the bitrate and really bring great video out of the thing but even right out of the box it is astonishing. Autofocus with the kit lens is very fast and silent. The Kit lens itself is almost too sharp. It's soo light, I can run it on a handheld steadicam without though of fatigue for most situations. The fully articulating LCD screen is a pleasure as well.Since there is no mirror, you can mount just about any SLR lens ever made on this thing with an adapter. You will not be able to autofocus and because of the sensor size being about half of 35mm film, you will be cropped (Or zoomed in) by a factor of 2. That means that the really nice Minolta Rokkor 50mm F1.4 is now a really nice 100mm F1.4. Finding fast wide angle lenses gets a bit more challenging and coslty. There is an adapter coming out that will reportedly cut the crop factor down to 1.5 and increase the light by a full stop but at a price of course. Still, it's really cool to have all those options out there in cheap used lenses.As a stills camera, it's pretty good. Not amazing like in video but still pretty good. The native aspect ratio is 4:3 which just looks too square to me so I often set it to 3:2 to match what my eyes are used to when composing a shot. The sensor in the GH2 is a little oversized purposefully to accompdate multiple aspect ratios better so you don't take as huge of a hit in resolution. RAW is 14bit I believe and what you will want to shoot in if you are serious about the pictures. The JPEG engine is not all that great...The controls are pretty well laid out. Aperature and Shutter are conrolled by a single dial when in full manual mode. I am used to seperate dials but the single dial works well as you click it in to switch betweed the two. There is a 1:1 focus assist that will kick in either when you move the focus ring or on demand via a assignable button. There is no autofocus motor in the camera so it is completely on the lens to get it fast. The kit lens is VERY fast focusing. I really like that shutter release mode, focsing mode and focus metering are all on levers. even though it has a touchscreen, Panasonic didn't drop any manual controls from the GH1 so you really don't have to go into a menu for anything once you have the camera set the way you like.I really enjoy this camera and the video I've gotten out of it impresses the heck out of people.", "Date": "January 17, 2013"}, {"Title": "All smiles", "Author": "Bradley", "ReviewID": "R1VYVAH9JOA8AS", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This camera is amazing.I have to be honest, this is my first DSLR or I should phrase it M 4:3 camera.I have used my friends 60d and d90, which are very awesome cameras in their own right.

I do notice noise when you push it around the 3200iso setting, however it does create some stellar low light photos.Fold out screen is very nice. It has a setting where you can tap the screen to take a picture. I have very shaky hands so even with a tripod it is difficult for me to take longer exposures without nudging the camera.  This is a great temp solution to getting a remote trigger.The stock lens that comes with it is complete garbage. Your first investment should be to upgrade with better glass. I was lucky enough to grab an adapter and put on some very old Pentex lens on the camera.I have tried the Hack for the video but it requires the highest Mb/sec card available which is quite expensive. So that being said, the standard video out of this thing is pretty super awesome. Very detailed, very sharp.The built in mics on the top are very responsive.

This review is to give my perspective from upgrading from a point and shoot(p&s;) to a MICRO FourThirds.Although the price is a little less than my purchase two weeks ago, I can in no way belittle the camera, the reseller yes but not the camera.  Several of my friends are either photographers or have a background in photography, they were helpful in picking a camera.  They obviously were more for a DSLR than the FourThirds but they did give useful information.  Admittedly none of them every used a Micro FourThirds so I had to take this into consideration.  After several months of research on which camera would be best suited for me, I chose this one.  I have been pleasantly pleased.  The learning curve is a little steep but overall is well worth it.  The pictures are great and the more I play with the camera the better they are getting.  When I first received it, I had some frustrating moments when using aperture and manual mode so I reverted to the iAuto mode.  Like most of the reviews I read, the pictures in auto are soft at times, it is still a better picture than I every took with a P&S.;  I have only started playing with the movie part of the camera.  This is ironic because this was purchased mostly for the video capability.  This should tell you that this camera will surprise you.  I never thought I would enjoy taking pictures this much. The manual is very weak in detail but covers the basics.  Is this the best camera for everyone, no.  Would everyone enjoy using it(as long as they have an open mind), I would say yes. Would I recommend this, most definitely.UpdateI updated the firmware and used the manual movie mode set to cinema and record quality at 24L.  Recorded 15 minutes of Christmas lights at night and the video it produced was excellent. It produced every bit as much detail as the video clips I watched while researching the camera.

Imperfect, but overall quite reasonable.This isn't a professional level DSLR, the micro four thirds series has to date been something of a compromise between the pro-level DSLR and a compact camera.  The camera is very tweak-able, in fact it often needs to be tweaked to perform well.  Shooting without a flash tends to underexpose, while the exposure with the flash is typically pretty good to spot-on.  As far as performance, this camera is top-notch, it focuses quickly, shoots quickly, has little if any detectable viewfinder / screen lag.The body has lots of dials, numerous custom buttons, and other controls to play with.  Most serve some useful purpose once you get used to the interface.  A non-multitouch (single touch only) screen can be used if desired, not as good as a modern smartphone but usable for setting focus points or quick changes to settings.  Otherwise, the menu system is rather antiquated, not at all configurable ('my menu' cannot be configured, it simply holds the last several selections) and one can spend a lot of time hunting for a particular option.  About the only saving grace is that three common options can be assigned to buttons on the body for easy access.The body design is functional, but stodgy, perfectly fine in your hands or when being used, but not the best for storage (compared to, say, the GF1, GF2, or the olympus slim body).  The viewfinder sticks out a lot from the body, making it hard to fit into a pocket or a small pouch that could otherwise fit a GF1 or compact camera.Video modes are reasonably well done, and this camera can produce very good video if you take the time to set up and know what you are doing from a video standpoint.", "Date": "May 13, 2011"}, {"Title": "Little powerhouse - great for video", "Author": "Nate Saucier", "ReviewID": "R1Q80UDHFHDFK0", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This camera simply blows other DSLR video out of the water - especially once its firmware is hacked.

Electronic viewfinder: I have a Nikon D700 as well as a 7D. The nikon I use mostly for my macro still work the 7D sits on the shelf collecting dust, because I use the GH2s instead. The reason for this is the electronic viewfinder. Both the GH2 and the Canon do a very good job at HD video, but the electronic viewfinder makes it possible to record video as if you are shooting stills by being able to record and use the viewfinder. With the 7D you are forced to use the LCD on the back which does not work outside without buying an extra devise to block out light and help you eye focus on the screen.Lots of small pancake lenses. The M4/3 line up is filled with small prime lenses as well a at least one small zoom. All the non kit lenses I own are very sharp.

It's much smaller than an entry level dSLR  or super zoom camera like the canon SX40. It has a really nice feel in my hands especially with the kit lens. The lenses for this type of camera are much smaller and lighter than a similar dSLR lens so the total weight is much less.  This is just one of the appeals to this mirror less camera.  A long telephoto lens could make the GH2 feel unbalanced.  I haven't tried one yet.The first shock on using the GH2 was how large and bright the EVF viewfinder was, much larger than my Canon 60D. The GH2 camera is mirror less; you view the scene as the sensor sees it rather than through the lens.  Many people in reviews have complained that they prefer an optical viewfinder especially in low light situations.  I think a superb EVF viewfinder as found on the GH2 is vastly superior to any optical viewfinder for the following reasons.1. All the data can be viewed without moving your eye from the viewfinder, including histogram and every setting that you can display on the LCD  screen.2. You can immediately determine if white balance and exposure are set wrong before snapping the image.  Pressing the video button, the camera becomes a powerful camcorder that many claim revivals a professional camcorder. There are few camcorders today under $1000 that have viewfinders so many purchases this camera for that purpose.  I haven't tried it yet.3. You don't have to remove your eye from the viewfinder to see if your image came out perfectly, just snap another image, or quickly change a setting and snap away without moving your eye.4. Disadvantage: Not great in low light situations but improves when you bump up the iso.The camera is lightning fast focusing and storing images. The burst is jaw dropping.  There are actual buttons for just about all the important functions. There are multiple custom settings which is also nice. It may take some time to fully master all its capability.  If you wonder if this camera is for you, I suggest you read the many excellent professional reviews written about this camera. Read those reviews first.  One caution:  the current camera kit does not include the excellent 14-140 Panasonic lens. The current kit which is what I bought  includes a typical kit lens which I think is just so-so.I bought an inexpensive  Fotoiox (nice product), Canon and Nikon lens adaptors so that I could try a number of my prime lenses on this camera. They work OK but having tried all my lenses, I came to the conclusion than nothing beats autofocus and image stabilization. Image stabilization is probably one of the best inventions along with digital to improve photography and make great image taking available to anyone.  I was quickly reminded how difficult it is to hold the camera perfectly steady for even a normal lens shot in low light without image stabilization or high iso. With very long exposures the viewfinder will go blank.  That will happen also to a dSLR while the mirror is locked up blocking the viewfinder.Like many of you reading this review, I'm no pro and make no claims to any special knowledge. just 50 plus years of taking pictures and enjoying every moment.  I own over 25 film and digital cameras and this camera is by far the most complex and capable camera I have purchased.  It's possible for a beginner to successfully use this camera if they initially use the IA setting with the kit lens. You can get great images but most beginners will want to expand to P mode and make some changes as they learn the camera. The pictures should rival a dSLR except in lower light and depending on the quality of lens used.  Many claim the micro family of lenses are on a par with their dSLR counterparts but I haven't bought any yet.I gave the camera 5 stars because it deserves 5 stars. The GH2 has been replaced by the GH3 with even greater feature set and performance and should be looked at too. I should mention that I bought this camera on one of Amazon great deals. I saw the camera for the first time when I opened the box. Like you, I read the reviews and knew this was something special and you can tell I was not disappointed.There are so many choices for cameras today; it is very difficult to decide which one to buy.  I personally prefer the super zoom style like the Panasonic FZ150 because it's a camera that includes all the lenses you will ever need in one package and you do not need to sell your home to buy a good lens. I also find my Canon S95 a favorite subcompact camera that I carry around all the time and provides superb images for a small sensor camera. If you chose to buy the GH2, you will be in for a pleasant experience and lots of great images. One other bit of advise, never, ever sell your current digital camera if you are so inclined, until you know for certain this is the only camera you want to use.", "Date": "January 17, 2013"}, {"Title": "Takes crystal clear pictures.

However, there are two things you should know before buying it:  it chews up batteries, and if you ever have to deal with Panasonic Customer Service, God help you.We are serious amateur photographers with a closet full of Nikon equipment, and we bought this unit as a travel camera for my wife, who at 67 was tired of hauling several pounds of equipment on long trips.  We took it immediately after purchase on a trip to Italy, and found to our horror that it was getting only 35 to 60 photos on a fully charged battery (we had purchased two batteries, so the problem was definitely in the camera).  Since we were used to getting 400 or more with our Nikon gear, we called Panasonic service, who said they could not help us because we were in Europe; so we called Amazon, who graciously agreed to accept it as a return when we got back a month later.Because Amazon was out of stock when we returned from Italy, we took the credit and repurchased the camera from B&H.;  This unit seemed to have slightly better battery life, but we got caught up in real life and failed to do controlled tests.  When we finally got around to doing that, we found that the range of battery life in carefully controlled conditions was 65 to 195 shots.  Since both the Panasonic literature and the reviews said that number should be over 300, and the camera was still under warranty, we sent it to the McAllen Texas repair facility.  They returned it promptly saying they had tested it and took over 400 pictures and the battery was still fully charged, so they were returning it without any further action.  I am pretty sure of either one of two things:  they produced 400 shutter releases by setting the shutter on multiple exposure mode and holding it down for a few minutes at a time (since there is no possible way one could get that many exposures in normal use); or, the McAllen facility is not a repair facility at all, but actually a \"repackage and return\" operation with a selection of form letters to include in the package (another, similar experience with them actually supports the latter view).We got the camera home, tested again (same results--65 to 125 shots under normal use), and decided to buy another battery or two and live with the problem.  Unfortunately the factory batteries cost $50 to 60 each, and oddly enough, the Amazon reviews of them feature many complaints about very small capacity/short life.I am giving this camera three stars because it is a very nice travel camera, but the annoyance of carrying three or four batteries to get through a day is major.  And Panasonic customer service's attitude is unconscionable.

Harrison", "ReviewID": "R1NVJNDI6F72P6", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "This review is specifically for cinematographers, as I am one myself.  Having shot several films with GH2s now, I can say it is a potentially great low budget indie film camera, but is crippled in several unnecessary ways.  First off, the Lumix lenses all seem to have this ridiculous \"accelerating\" focus ring, which changes focus more the faster you turn it.  Makes focusing awkward and racking with marks impossible.  Don't confuse this with focus-by-wire, which generally works fine for racking on other camera brands.  Panasonic did add a cartoon indicator on the monitor displaying focus position, and you can set marks on that with a piece of tape.  But be careful, it jumps around depending on your display mode, and disappears some of the time.  The AF100 displays an actual number for focus distance, so you can always pay an extra $3000 for that feature.  Fine, so you can shoot your films all with old canon or nikon primes, which works but doesn't take advantage of the super-cool way Panasonic came up to do in camera correction of barrel distortion and CA in their lenses.  Bummer.  Next, Panasonic added HDMI out while recording, a feature absent from the GH1.  But focus assist punch-in is disabled when a monitor is plugged in.  What???  Whose thought that was acceptable?  So everyone on set has to constantly unplug the external monitor to set focus marks and then plug it back in for each setup.  Doable, but a pain.  Related to that, you get both the builtin and external monitors displaying while recording, but for playback the builtin monitor shuts off.  Weird.  OK, well, one great thing about the GH1/2 is continuous autofocus while filming.  Good for certain types of shooting.  But don't be fooled by their marketing literature about \"fast\" contrast based focusing.  Every significant focus change displays noticeable \"hunting\" for focus except in the brightest of conditions.  Kind of ruins the moment to constantly see the camera zoom back and forth.  Finally, like all consumer cameras, you get 23.976 frames per second, but not true 24.  The camera should offer both for compatibility both with film speeds and TV (NTSC) speeds.  Many on the web assert that true 24 fps would desync the audio, but they are just confused.Hope this is useful.  I only point out the negatives so people won't be disappointed when they discover these things on their own.

Out of the box, the video capabilities of this little gem are impressive. However, with the proper firmware modifications (i.e., \"hacks\"), which are all readily available online and remarkably easy to implement, the results are nothing short of phenomenal. To see cinema-quality footage of your family vacation broadcast in 1080p over a 50+ inch TV is something everyone needs to experience just once. Gone are the days of desaturated, low contrast, poorly-exposed home videos shot with the handheld potato. The GH2 pumps out high def sex for your eye holes, and doesn't even ask for dinner.Having said all that, the minute you try to rely on this camera for still photos, it will dump on you -- unadulterated, unfiltered, straight-from-the-source man-sewage all over your dreams and desires. Sure, the GH2 looks like a \"camera,\" but a hooker can look like a \"wife,\" too. And the analogy doesn't end there. Expecting this little guy to churn out a Nikon or Canon SLR-quality shot is tantamount to expecting a prostitute to know which one is the \"salad fork.\" It's just not that class of girl. It does one thing very well -- VERY well -- but just gets by for the rest. It is subpar in IQ, AF, and low-ISO performance. It's not small enough to pocket, but is easily out-performed by a number of much smaller cameras by most still-photo metrics.But, you aren't buying this for still photos, right? RIGHT? No, you're buying this for VIDEO. You already HAVE a still-photo camera.

The manual, though, is ridiculous, with a useless index that doesn't help you find anything.  There is no logic to it.  I've wasted so much time searching through it in vain.For example, if you need to look up \"Burst Mode,\" it's not under \"B\" but instead you have to rely on sheer luck to find it under \"P\" for \"Photography using Burst Mode.\"  What kind of nitwit designs an index like that?  Alphabetize the key words, idiots!My biggest complaint: I'd like to know if I can defeat that instant playback image that appears in the Viewfinder after every shot, keeping you from seeing the live viewfinder image.  If you're shooting a group of action pictures, you have to remember to press the shutter release all the way down for the first shot, then quickly press it halfway down to clear the playback image away so that you can see where the subject has just moved to!  (Usually he's already moved completely out of the viewfinder while you're blinded!)  But you usually can't \"halfway press it\" fast enough to keep up.  You have to put it in Burst mode and hope you can see your subject moving out of sight (and forget about framing the picture while you desperately try to keep up.)I don't even know if I can turn off that unwanted instant playback and just have a live, unobstructed viewfinder, because looking under \"V\" for Viewfinder is an exercise in futility.  Maybe it's hidden somewhere in the manual under \"Wanting to turn off the playback\" but so far I haven't found it under \"W.\"  Maybe it's in the index under \"B\" for \"Being unable to see your subject for the annoying, obstuctive instant playback.\"If this camera does not have the option to keep the viewfinder live and open during shooting, then it is practically useless for anyone shooting moving subjects, such as sporting events.  I wish I'd known that before sinking over a grand into it.Any SLR gives you a live, unobstructed viewfinder, but I specifically wanted a smaller Micro Four Thirds camera, and there is no reason why this camera has to force you to miss shots while desperately trying to clear the viewfinder.

I thought there was something wrong with the camera. Then I thought perhaps the automatic focus only functions in record. I borrowed a memory card from my other camera and tried that... That was it!

The zoom is a variable aperture lens, no big deal with that. nor is it the reason for flickering during zoom.As I said earlier I am not happy with the zoom function. It flickers the picture while your zooming...  No setting has been able to stop this.

In reality, I think it's a decent camera but far far far from the best.First off, the AF may be twice as fast as that on the GH1, but it pales in comparison to an advanced amateur or pro level SLR. Frankly, it is somewhat sluggish. Maybe it's good for a 4/3 camera, but that's about where it ends.Smaller, lighter camera - yes one of its good points.Full time live view with swivel screen - Another great feature.Touch focus - Won't comment as I haven't used it.WYSIWIG - Sorry, but this is something that old pros who have been in the business for decades generally do not agree with. Fact is, camera manufacturers have in recent years gotten so cheap in their implementations of viewfinders that it is rare to find one anymore with anything that is acceptable. Yes this camera may have something that is an improvement over most of what's on the market nowadays but frankly it sucks compared to the viewfinders found in cameras from the 80s.Shoot with any lens you want - IF you are willing to give up AF and auto apertures. If you are, I wonder why you would purchase a camera like this to begin with.Image quality - Sorry but there is NOT irrelevant differences in image quality among cameras nowadays and stating so shows a lack of appreciation for the better quality obtainable with cameras such as the Canon 5D MKII and Nikon D3x.Great sports camera merely because it can shoot at 40fps? Sorry but the AF is not good enough for sports photography (frankly very little AF is on ANY camera) and shooting in manual focus would preclude any ability to shoot sports as one cannot focus accurately enough with this kind of viewfinder.At any rate, it seems to be a decent camera for what it is..good image quality, good video quality (though I wouldn't choose it over a good dedicated video camera for video), great handling and great size. But the best camera on the planet? Hardly!", "Date": "December 25, 2010"}, {"Title": "Photo quality so so, GH2 manuals not clear, expensive, video better", "Author": "whzuser384tq", "ReviewID": "R32EDN3D2OV29G", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "SummaryIf you need a movable LCD for photos or video, or fast auto focus video, I think the choices are GH2 or Sony a33/a55 (others may auto focus too slowly, read reviews, performance data). Canon and Nikon are not there yet. Otherwise, Canon, Nikon and Sony appear to be better deals for photos. For greater options in video, GH2 in 2010, early 2011 seems the best. Sony may have an updated model later.I find the GH2 desirable for some video situations, less desirable than comparable cameras for taking photos, for accessories, for availability of supporting information (books, websites, explanations, etc.), for apparent construction quality (the lens moves too much), for situations in low light or fast moving objects where one wants very fast shutter speed (consistent with reviews in other websites). Image stability does not appear superior to comparable cameras, in my results more pictures were more blurred, colors not as good. It has faster focusing speed during video (to follow objects better, like people or animals). I liked better the indoor photos taken with a Canon 60D (under almost identical conditions). Indoor video was usually more in focus than the Canon 60D, but, when in focus, seemed comparable or sometimes the 60D looked better. My results seem consistent with sensor and camera reviews. See DXO Labs. The zoom ratio of the 60D was adequate for my indoor and outdoor (did not need the Panasonic 14-140 mm). The shorter kit zoom was too short for zooming indoors. I bought the panasonic zoom lens 45-200mm, but I would prefer a ~ 20-110mm zoom as the more useful lens. The 14-140 mm zoom is too expensive, aperture too small; carrying two lenses is inconvenient (and quickly changing lenses is inconvenient or impractical in many settings). Read other web site reviews for quality of photos compared to similar cameras. Different users report different experiences with video. It probably depends on conditions, indoor vs outdoor, a professional with expertise and access to lights, lenses vs. a consumer who does not set up adequate lights and instead takes short videos of events at home, parties, events (I take videos at professional meetings and other events, mostly indoor, where it is not practical for me to set up special lights and rely on available light). I bought the GH2 based on several reviews, but I found the reviews do not reflect my experience. Perhaps there are good reasons why so many people buy the Nikon D3100 (which appears to produce better photos). Several people criticize this review by attacking my personality instead of providing comparative, factual data on the cameras. Any review must compare the GH2 to what is available x similar price.BackgroundThese are my opinions and my experience. Read other reviews for other people's opinions, but, please, don't argue with my opinions or how I write them, or claim that you are far smarter than me or I do not know how to use a camera. Attacks on the personality of a reviewer are improper and reflect poorly on the writer. If you disagree, please write your own, don't play English teacher or psychiatrist or claim you are smart and can figure out manuals and take better pictures.A viewpoint as a physicist in a field other than photography, who understands the concepts of photography, willing to put the time to learn, but does not have the time to decipher tricky manuals or explanations, or spend time changing settings before every photo, getting white balance before every set of photos, converting raw to better photos, learning multiple software programs, etc.I owned and used (change cameras when appropriate) a GH1, GH2, G10 and Canon 60D (as well as other related products). I taught college level physics, so I have a general understanding of optics and equipment. My review is within a framework of what alternatives exist today (not 3 years ago or 3 years later) and price range ~ $600 - $1600 (cameras like Nikon D3100, D7000, Canon T3i, 60D, Sony a33, 55v).My focus, in accordance with amazon guidelines, is on the product, not the personalities or language skills of other reviewers. It is inappropriate to focus criticism on other reviewers instead of the product.CommentsSee sensor ratings. Compared with 60D (photos taken concurrently) needs slower shutter. Means requires more light. Photos look less nice, sometimes off color. Weight less, smaller size, but difference feels small. 60D seems easier to use (controls, shutters, visual aids). Non interchangeable parts are difficult to find (I could not find a GH2 AC adapter in Amazon.com, it is expensive, and not included with my GH2 as it was with the GH1). Manuals should be clear. One should not need to decipher them like Egyptian hieroglyphics or WW II spy messages. Menus and touchable parts should be consistently placed with consistent meaning. Typical uses should be clearly described. With modern technology is takes little time to prepare good manuals with good pictures and audio visual examples.Learning to use a camera should be very simple (compared to learning to use biophysics equipment or taking a case to the Supreme Court). I am referring to the technical aspects, not the art of taking photos.  I want a camera that takes very good pictures in low light (because frequently take photos indoor without flash), and very good videos. For these purposes, quick autofocus is essential. Furthermore, zoom lenses in cameras should have a lever like video cameras (otherwise it is difficult to move the lens). I bought the lever from Panasonic. It is a simple part that cost me about $30, but could be produced for far less and be included with the camera. My position is that manufacturers should provide more value to buyers, not force them to buy inexpensive extra parts at a high cost.There should be an electronic file with all the settings and variations, available to download, with specific guidelines for using them, moving among menus, etc. The ability to take good videos, slow and fast motion, and a sequence of photos or videos over time is also important. And the technology exists to provide these features now. I used the Canon 60D. It was far too slow for videos or using the LCD screen. This is another issue: some people cannot use the viewfinder (due to eye issues or the way the camera is used, they need the LCD, preferable a moving LCD). Even though the 60D took excellent photos, I cannot recommend it because of the slow response in video, and, also, apparently using the LCD, very slow response for photos. And the D7000 or D3100 has no movable screen, and not clear it is as fast as the GH2 for auto focus video. IF Canon or Nikon offer fast auto focus with movable screen, like the GH2, in future models, they could be a better deal. The Sony a55 is more comparable to GH2 in features (very fast autofocus using movable LCD for photos, video).I go to Panasonic.com. Look x accessories. It lists DMW-DCC8 Coupler for extended indoor use. I do not find an adequate description of what it does, what models it works with. It refers to me to another accessory. Go to DMW-AC8 AC Adapter for select Panasonic Digital Cameras. It appears to indicate it only works on GH2. I have an adapter from the GH1. Will it work on the GH2? My GH1 AC adapter has the # 00706. I cannot find a model #. Is it different from the DMW-AC8? Can I use it with the GH2? Are there restrictions or guidelines to use (I would like to use it to take 10 hour pictures with an intervalometer, a timer). It is not enough to know the power requirements or shape, there could be hidden incompatibilities.There are thousands (probably millions) of events in business, health, teaching, etc. where one wants to take multiple pictures every few minutes (or seconds) over a period of hours to see how things move along. It is simple for the manufacturer to post clear, comprehensive descriptions of the product and use. Nikon, for some cameras, sells software to control the camera using a PC. This can be very useful.Today, for many users, good video with auto focusing is essential. For families, video gives a window of the world not seen in a photo. Too bad that I found GH2 accessories inconsistent (between G10, GH1, GH2), too few (not clear if intervalometers work well, no official word on Panasonic site), and photos, to me, don't look as good as those of a 60D (and, thus, I presume the D7000 and D3100 and Sony a33/55 will make better looking photos, particularly in low light, see sensor reviews).It would be really useful if manufacturers standardize typical accessories instead of having trivial differences that interfere with use. Why so many different AC adapters, batteries, etc? It appears as if there are different batteries and AC adaptors and parts for the GH1, G10, GH2, GF2. If I was in charge I would compel manufacturers to use interchangeable parts. It would be good for their business, as people will find more uses and buy more products.I give the GH2 3 stars (may be less if I find more problems): it is not up to the 60D in photo quality (and probably cameras with higher sensor scores than the GH2). The manual is not well written. Panasonic.com for cameras is not well designed and written. It is unnecessarily difficult to use. Accessories are expensive. The automatic feature does not give me good photos like the canon 60D. Motion compensation is not good enough. In 2011 there seem to be better competitors. Once competitors introduce fast video focusing and better options x aperture, shutter in video, their superior picture quality will likely be better choices than the slightly smaller/lighter Panasonic format (unless Panasonic makes drastic changes to performance, service, features, accessories). Thus, I suggest be careful when investing in too many lenses. These lenses may not be compatible with a better camera in 2011 or later.Ex: compare the GH2 with 14-140mm lens (usually about $1500+) to Canon EOS 7D Black 18MP Digital SLR Camera Kit w/ 28-135mm Lens, from Walmart ~ $1700 + great prices and return policy. For many users, the Canon may produce better photos, and adequate video. Early 2011Frequently overlooked issue with LCD. SLR cameras usually use different technology to focus when viewing through the viewfinder vs. LCD. Viewfinder focus is pretty fast on all top cameras. BUT LCD focus is usually very slow (different technology) except on the GH2 and Sony a55. Usually, focus is via LCD when the image is viewed on the LCD. This is convenient for videos and photos, and for people who may have difficulty viewing things through viewfinder (because of glasses, nature of environment, etc.). Looking at an LCD is faster and easier, and bigger, than a viewfinder. My experience with the Canon 60D is that it took too long to focus when looking through LCD. SOme cameras don't have LCD. I consider the LCD (and fast focusing) an essential feature for people who go around taking pictures in different environments, mostly indoors (homes, schools, offices, etc.) and do not have the time and equipment and expertise to be a pro photographer. This means most professionals and business persons in fields other than photography. But I also found a good SLR provides far better photos of kids and friends than a compact, particularly when it is practical to carry it and set up. A compact is more practical for carryhing it all the time and worry less about damage.", "Date": "January 30, 2011"}, {"Title": "Feels really really cheap", "Author": "danabeyin", "ReviewID": "R1XJTTQZ3ENS4V", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "I have nothing to say about the video quality of this product.

So, did more diligence (depreview.com) and found two other cameras as contenders for the \"weekend warrior photographer\" that I am --- the Sony NEX-7 and the Panasonic GH2.  While I might have gone for the NEX-7, since it looks like it pretty much wins many comparative tests among the three cameras, it was out of my price range (limit around $1000, give or take $250); plus, the NEX-7 doesn't appear to be readily available.Anyway, was pretty much sold on the D60, but two things were nagging me - camera size first (and associated handling), and to a much lesser extent, getting the best video for the price range (though still-photography coming first).  The D60 is a big camera (granted, not as big as the Canon 5D or even 7D), and since this will be my \"go-to\" camera (except for my iphone), wanted to be sure that a smaller, allegedly equally capable camera could not do the job.With regard to video - from my research on online reviews and forums, youtube, etc., the GH2 seems to be the hands down winner, without resorting to a true video camera (though, the D60 is no slouch).  Since video would be my secondary consideration - it came down to camera size/handling.  So, working in Manhattan, I took a 15 min walk to B&H; so I could actually pick up the GH2 and feel it.Well, to be brutely honest - it felt really cheap and chintzy compared to the Canon; felt (for lack of a better work), like a piece of crap.  Also, and maybe I'm getting old and/or I'm old-fashioned, I DID NOT LIKE the electronic viewfinder - it did what it was supposed to do, but to me - it just doesn't compare to an optical viewfinder quite frankly - especially a DSLR optical viewfinder.While the GH2 apparently is a great camera (according to the specs, other reviews on Amazon, B&H;, dpreview, etc.), which I don't doubt, it comes down to personal preference.
