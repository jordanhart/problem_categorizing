{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Good but All Underwater Compacts Have a Long Way to Go", "Author": "Tripod", "ReviewID": "R3V2GTS6PA1QGE", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "I'm a prosumer photographer that owns 6 cameras, as of today 7 including this one.  This is my third underwater (others are Canon D10 and GoPro Hero 3+ Black edition).I bought this as a replacement for my bulbous and dated Canon D10.  I hate using water housings and would never risk one of my DSLRs in one or shell out for one anyway.  I simply like the fact that I can take a waterproof camera in my swimsuit pocket around all day on the beach or on dive boats and never worry about it.After doing more hours of research online than I care to admit, it came down to the Panasonic Lumix TS-5 and the Nikon AW120.  I still had to try out each in a store before choosing, and even then wasn't sure.  All of which underlines not that there's a great field of worthy choices to choose from, but each UW camera out there as of this writing has so many weaknesses it's difficult to choose the least bad one.Here are the differences I found by briefly trying the Lumix and AW120 in-store:- the AW120 has slightly slimmer dimensions, but noticeably less heavy, which appealed to me- the Lumix has a far stronger, more evenly-lighting flash (or maybe it was automatically choosing slow-sync, but it doesn't matter, it looked great); I don't plan to take too many land night shots, but I've seen that underwater flash does come out better on Lumix- the Lumix appears to have more \"features\", but they're basically useless:  e.g. timelapse (but the shortest interval is a pointless 10 seconds, should be a half-second), \"manual mode\" (can only change either aperture from wide open to fully stopped down, or shutter speed from fast to 4 seconds)- the Lumix has a terrible live view when you pan (even slowly), the display stutters to catch up; I only ever see this on the cheapest of compacts; very visually annoying as you can't see what you're about to shoot and a dealkiller for me- the ergonomics of the Nikon are better to me; it feels more natural in my hand and the buttons feel better also- AW120 lacks the common \"Display\" button though; that's annoying- video record is on the back on the AW120, but on the top on the Lumix; my preference is on the back, where I'll never ever confuse it for the shutter release button- reviews say the Lumix user interface is better but I found the Nikon to be more intuitiveOther reasons I bought the Nikon, even though the Lumix has definitely better dynamic range (from the pics I've seen online):- the Nikon has f/2.8 max aperture while the Lumix has a slower f/3.3, and good light is hard to come by underwater- the Nikon is also wider at the wide end, and I've never seen water damage complaints for the Nikons vs lots of complaints for the Lumix (and terrible customer support from Panasonic).- the Lumix has better video quality, but it can only do 1080p in AVCHD format!  Lame, since it's not Mac-friendly; I could deal with the more-painful-than-usual transcoding process of AVCHD but why do I want to transcode (and degrade) in the first place just to view on my computer?  Super lame.- the Lumix has proprietary connectors, not micro-USB like everyone else.  So if I lose it among my 30-something connectors, I'm in trouble.  Yes, this is what Panasonic thinks is a good idea in 2014.Yet, you always learn more when you actually take a camera home.  Here are my first impressions:- First thing I notice is the strap.  There's no true water strap.  The manual describes the strap that comes with it as being for land use only, but it's really ridiculous, the kind that's so big you're probably supposed to wear it around your neck - who wears a compact around their neck??  The Lumix strap is more normal, but it still doesn't have a way to cinch around your wrist.  It seems like all the manufacturers want you to buy a separate floaty strap, although I could care less if the camera floats just as long as it's cinched around my wrist.  I'll just have to borrow the strap off my D10.  For the record, camera manufacturers, here is a REAL water strap (notice the cinch), and they should always be included: [...]- Second, the battery cannot be charged by removing it, putting in a simple charger, and plugging into the wall.  It has to stay in the camera, with the battery door OPEN so the micro-USB can connect to the inside of the camera.  This sounds good on an engineer's paper, but in the real world it's a flaw.  Why?  Because as the battery door lays open over an hour or so to charge, it gathers lint, dust, whatever from the surfaces it touches and the air.  Anyone who understands water sealing knows it takes only a tiny hair to break the seal underwater - and sure enough, upon inspection after charging, I had two small fibers right on the rubber seal gasket.  Sure I could brush them off with the included tiny brush (which I'm sure I'll lose), but why should I have to?  The only upside is that the micro-USB can be used to charge directly from a computer or other device, which I can see being useful in some circumstances.  The Lumix can't do that at all, you need a wall outlet.- Also, I don't like the shutter release on the AW120.  It's flush with the camera body, so you can't really squeeze it like you should, you have to press it.  That doesn't help sharpness in low-light.These are smaller items of course; the pictures count most.  Will update in a month or so when I've taken lots of underwater pictures.Side note to manufacturers and everyone - why do all these UW compacts have a ridiculous 16 MP?  Please stop this terrible arms race!  16 MP is HURTING image quality by increasing noise, accompanied by detail-destroying noise reduction.  Start educating consumers that what's needed now are bigger apertures, bigger sensors and better processors.UPDATE:OK after using this camera on a 2 week trip to Thailand, here are my additional thoughts:- underwater photos came out quite nice, about as I expected- land photos are so-so, but as I expected for a camera like this- the photo review time (display time on the LCD after you shoot) is insanely short (about 0.5 seconds); there is no way I can find to extend it, which is annoying- the photo review \"info display\" unfortunately is nearly useless; if you care about reviewing the aperture, shutter speed, ISO, flash mode, shot mode, and maybe depth you're out of luck- underwater videos came out very nice, way better than my old Canon D10 (although I expect that most cameras in this class have about as good video)- battery life was great; I used it all day without a worry; blows the GoPro away in this regard- the on-screen barometer/depth meter is nothing short of awesome; when I was scuba diving, I never needed to look at my depth gauge because the camera told me everything; I only wish it would record the depth in the metadata but you can't have it all- no problems whatsoever with waterproofing or condensation; in fact I definitely took it below the 18m rating on my dives; at about 22m I was freaking out because I could see the LCD slightly bending inward under the pressure, but the camera held up like a champ- underwater auto white balance was not as accurate as the Lumix (from reviews I've seen); I later realized that the camera does have a custom white balance setting, which I should've set by shooting the palm of my hand underwater- the Easy Auto mode very intelligently switches to Macro when you're close to a subject above water, but not at all when underwater; had some frustration in constantly forcing the camera into macro mode underwater (but I know of no camera that does it any better)- the slow-sync flash mode, which usually produces a look I love in night land shots, is not nearly as good as Canons; shame but of course I wouldn't usually use this camera at night on land anyway", "Date": "March 31, 2014"}, {"Title": "Nice", "Author": "Troy D.", "ReviewID": "RWGLJ97DMSB58", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "First off, this is an upgrade to the fairly popular AW-110, and there's a ton of YouTube videos that list the features and show comparisons to other cameras. I suspect that Nikon wanted to compete with the Olympus TG-2 with this model, which has similar features. The biggest upgrade here is the 24 mm wide-angle lens and faster maximum aperture of 2.8. The Olympus still has an F2 lens. There is of course a GPS, and Wi-Fi. I don't much use my camera as a compass, so this really wasn't a big deal for me. I can see where the Wi-Fi could come in useful for remotely controlling the camera.  Nikon has also added a number of new video formats. Admittedly at highest resolution you're going to generate some humongous file sizes. Even a short video can run 500 to 600 megs. I suspect most people would be happy with the 720 mode.I would not get too wrapped up in megapixel rating as the sensor sizes are generally very small in point and shoot cameras.  More megapixels does not necessarily equate to better images. In fact, it usually means more noise. I'm not sure how this camera stacks up against other point-and-shoot cameras in its class as most of my other gear is pro equipment. To me, I see a fair amount of noise even at ISO 400, but again I think this is pretty common for this price level camera.There's a number of things that do bother me about this camera. One is the zoom. I don't know if I have a defective camera, but the zoom is very jerky, and not smooth at all. Occasionally (Frequently)  it just zooms all the way out or all the way in instead of settling at an intermediate step. I'm going to contact Nikon about this as again, I may have a defective camera. I have been unable to take any professional looking, smooth videos.The focus is fairly fast. I will have to play a little bit with post production with the images, but the camera needs lots of light for best results.  I really would like to see an even faster lens. As to apertures, there is basically two. I believe it's 2.8 and 4.2. (Fireworks mode does stop the camera down more, but also changes the white balance). There is no way(mode)to stop the lens down further for greater depth of field or any kind of creative effects. The cameras is capable of slower shutter speeds, but you would have to put some neutral density filters in front of the lens if you want to access them for creative effects. I believe the Olympus has an advantage here.My understanding was that the older 110 model came with a filter adapter to allow you to use 40.5 mm filters, but this new does not include one. I'm not sure if they are available as an accessory or not.  There are quite a few \"Scene modes\" and then an easy auto if you really don't want to think about anything. Namely the camera will do its best, based on its programming, to get you a good picture. The auto mode (different than easy auto mode and scene mode) gives you much greater control, and you do have the option at least of turning the flash on and off, using fill-in flash, or slow sync, redeye reduction, timer, macro mode, etc. each scene mode add some kind of attribute. The party/event mode for example adds a redeye reduction, the close-up mode puts the camera into macro mode, the sports mode uses a high shutter speed, the fireworks mode turns off the auto white light balance, and puts the camera into a different color temperature and stops the lens down more and decreases shutter speed, the list goes on. The more you know about photography, the less you would be likely to use these modes, but I'm sure many people will appreciate them.If you're interested in more of the auto features I think these are very similar to the older model, and you can read about them in other reviews. I actually wish there was more manual control, but not very common with point-and-shoot style cameras. All the buttons are very small and pretty tough to read. I think you may be able to press the shutter release with a pair of gloves on, but other than that you would have to remove gloves to operate. Here again I think the Olympus has an edge.I was able to see the screen in sunlight, but it does tend to wash out. You can see well enough to compose your shot. I believe Nikon also attempted to improve the image stabilization as I see there is a \"hybird\" mode now. I really can't comment on how well it works over previous models, but my handheld videos look quite good.Color accuracy looks quite good, and I suspect resolution is decent for this class of camera. Again, don't be fooled by the 16 megapixel rating. My eight-year-Canon D-20 takes much better pictures at eight megapixel with less noise. Of course, this started out as a $1500 camera, so not exactly an apples to apples comparison.I would say for the price this camera has a lot of outstanding features. It's small, lightweight, has some pretty nice video with plenty of options, and image stabilization seems very good. The scene mode gives you loads to address most situations, but don't expect manual control here as you're not going to get any. I would say the still modes would give you good enough quality to produce a very nice 16 x 20 print. I even tried a 24 x 36 print last night and it held its own--impressive. The fill-in flash mode worked very well in my few test, whereas used as a main flash it's a bit harsh. Again, pretty typical for a point-and-shoot.I only tried a few underwater shots, and did not even have the camera set to the proper mode, and got some good results. I think this camera could easily replace something like a Go Pro, and you can actually frame and see what you're shooting! Overall I think it represents an excellent value. Oh, I will add that I accidentally dropped the camera from 4' (thought I had it attached to the tripod screw and did not-ooops!) and it bounced a couple of times on my laminate floor. Not even a scratch!I'm taking off one star for the very poor zoom function.if you would like to know about any specific feature please don't hesitate to post a comment.Beat out the Black addition of the Go Pro:See [....]", "Date": "March 11, 2014"}, {"Title": "Modest improvement over the AW110", "Author": "Chris L.", "ReviewID": "R2GZBYAMXPGCII", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "This camera does what I ask of a point-and-shoot.  It's easy to use with a minimum of work to extract useable photos and video.  But as of right now, this camera costs $130 more than the camera it replaces, the Nikon AW110.  I purchased the AW120 over the AW110, with no reviews to guide my decision, hoping it resolved some of the AW110's shortcomings.  Here are some of my initial impressions:1. 24mm equivalent wide angle is more versatile than the 28mm AW110.2. There seems to be an extra lip around the lens to prevent unwanted fingers wandering into the frame.3. Longer rated battery life (using the same battery).4. The sensor and image processor appear to be identical to the AW110 - acceptable 16MP photos with heavy noise reduction smoothing (standard for this class of camera).  No improvement here.5. Smart auto mode appears biased toward \"night\" mode in low light.  This has the effect of relatively longer shutter speeds and blurry subjects if they are moving.  Setting the camera to portrait or regular auto mode seems to enable the flash and eliminate the blurry phenomenon.  From reviews of the AW110, the AW120 seems very similar with perhaps no improvement.6. Videos have a quiet ticking sound when using zoom during filming, but I found it acceptable.7. Charger does not have the option of charging the battery out of camera.  I believe this is a change from the AW110.8. Display screen is higher resolution than the AW110, but may still be prone to washout in bring sunlight.9. Buttons are on the mushy side.  They are probably the same as the AW110.  They are useable, but inferior to the Panasonic TS5 buttons for sure.So it boils down to a few modest improvements over the AW110 for quite a hike in price.  I really appreciate the 24mm wide angle and longer battery life (if true), but the rest of the camera is functionally equivalent to the AW110 (for me, anyway).  You'll have to decide for yourself if it's worth the premium.", "Date": "March 12, 2014"}, {"Title": "Worked extremely well, impressive little thing", "Author": "M. Hyman \"Artist at large\"", "ReviewID": "R251N8WKAIN9PS", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I bought this camera specifically for use at the beach and underwater. Having said that, I also used it as a general point and shoot camera. Primarily I use a DSLR, and using a point and shoot takes a bit getting used to. It certainly is no replacement, but it is also excellent at what it does.The camera is small, light, and easily fits in your pocket. I took it in hot tubs, swimming pools, beaches, the ocean, and scuba diving, and it was great not to worry about whether it could take the beating. In short, unlike my DSLR, where i'm very careful of moisture, temperature range and dirt, with this thing I took it every where.The camera has a broad range of electronic modes that are quite impressive -- a portrait mode that detects when people smile and takes photos then; a pet mode that knows when the pets face is visible; fireworks mode; automatic mode and many others. Although some of these are somewhat gimmicky, they actually work, and given that there isn't a real burst speed with the camera, they are quite useful. For example, consider smile mode. On a nice DSLR you can take 10 photos in a second, so you can usually get a range of smiles. With a point and shoot you really do need to choose your photo carefully and the mode works, which i thought was quite cool.I didn't find the HDR mode to be super useful, but i probably need to experiment with it more. Still, the HDR mode operates from a single click and is very easy to set up...much easier than what i have to do with my DSLR.I had some troubles with the panoramic mode. While it is way cooler than the mode on an iPhone, in that it supports horizontal and vertical panoramas and 180s and 360s, i did find it was a bit finicky, especially with verticals and 360s. There the failure rate was fairly high, where the camera would sometimes end the sequence before the panorama was complete.For battery life, i found the camera worked fine. I turned on GPS (supposed to drain the battery) and WiFi and found i could get 1.5 days of fairly heavy use ... say a few hundred photos. I'm sure the life is much longer if i turned off the GPS, but I generally download and charge overnight so i didn't see this as a big deal. The camera doesn't come with a charger where you pull the battery out and charge separately. I'm sure there are chargers that do that, but again, for my use case it didn't really matter. (By contrast, with my other camera i keep a stash of batteries ready)Charging and downloading involves opening up the sealed compartment. This is fairly easy to do. The camera comes with a brush for cleaning, which i wish i had brought with me, since i covered the thing with salt and sand on a regular basis. Still, it was easy to clean and i always got a good seal.Color tones, resolution were all excellent. I didn't figure out if there is an easy no-flash mode (i'm terrible at reading instructions) or if there is an easy way to adjust ISO.For night shooting i didn't have a tripod so i can't say much about its low light handling.For underwater shooting it was excellent and a blast to use. I've read reviews of the earlier model that said the display was useless underwater but i didn't find it so at all. In a pool without goggles, sure, you can't see the display. But you can't see anything.I took it scuba diving down to 45', and found the display to be crisp, easy to see, and very easy to use. I also loved the depth measurements (not sure if iPhoto stores them or not :( ) which was quite fun for scuba diving, and more convenient than looking at the tank meters. While there were some issues with shake in lower light conditions, most of the photos came out extremely well, and I didn't find there to be significant color problems. The brighter colored fish turned out quite well, and shots in murkier water turned out the way you would expect. Still, it was super easy to use, convenient to go to movie mode, and easy to take stills while actively filming movies. You can also easily zoom in and out, take photos, take movies etc one handed while under water and swimming, which is quite convenient. I used the underwater strap (separate purchase) which worked out great.Downloading is fast and easy, and most of the features are fairly intuitive. For example, the zoom lever is used when filming and also when previewing images.The wifi mode is kind of cool.The key thing is that you need to select the camera's wifi network from your iPhone network selections.. .then run the app. (Not exactly documented anywhere). Once i did that, it worked well and you can see from the camera lens on your phone, take pictures, download them, etc. I suppose that is pretty good for voyeur mode or fancy selfies... i tend to download and post from the computer so it wasnt too convincing for me, but if you primarily operate from your phone it should be quite convenient.Altogether, outside of quirkiness with the panorama modes it worked great.I tried the shake mode a few times but never got the hang of that so didn't bother.I still use my DSLR as my go to camera, but i'll definitely bring this with me at all times as well, and it is a heck of a lot more convenient for general use.Impressive camera, and quite fun for underwater use.

It works great although it did not have any instructions.  Even looking online at Nikon it did not have a users manual yet but I could use the AW110 instructions well enough.

Video light varies from light to dark and back to light. If you watch the entire video looks terrible. I have tested the camera indoor as well as outdoor in daylight and found the same light fluctuation issue.2) Cameras zoom motor makes loud buzzing noise and you can hear the loud annoying noise in your video playback.3) Camera zoom is not smooth even taking regular pictures, after one point it start jerking.As per Nikon these are  common issues and this camera (AW120) is not for making videos just for taking pictures.  Are you kidding me !!!!!
