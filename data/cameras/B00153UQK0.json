So far I like this unit but have a few problems with it which may just be part of the learning curve.The unit itself worked quickly out of the box. Installed a 500GB hard drive and set the time and date, then initialized the drive.Video showed up immediately but I am having some trouble with the interface. I can't figure out a few things I will list below:Not sure how to stop and start video recording. It appears that if it's on, it's automatically recording.Deleting or wiping the drive is not easy to locate or very intuitive. Finally figured it out but it took some time.The review/play interface is very odd and difficult to understand so far. Going directly to a certain spot of recorded video is not easy for me at this point.The user guide is big (PDF file) but contains a lot of information I did not find useful while the number one question I have about this unit went unanswered (getting the video off the drive, and converted to .AVI or .MPEG to be used online or put on a CD/DVD)Comes with software that installs to a PC or laptop that you then connect via Ethernet cable to the DVR. The PC/laptop software records to the PC/laptop itself and not to the DVR hard drive. I also had to purchase a 320GB external drive for my laptop to save the video to since I still can't figure out how to get the video off the DVR. So basically there are two duplicate recordings going on at once, one to the DVR and one to the computer drive, if you tell the computer to record. The quality of the video recorded via computer does not seem nearly as good as the video recording to the DVR.The remote control for the DVR has a lot of buttons and functions but not a very good user manual on how to use it. Oddly enough so far I haven't figured out how to stop and start recording using the remote. With all the buttons it has, I have been unable to find one for the recording function unless, as I expect, it records constantly and you have to use the Pause button to stop recording. Again, so far this is unclear.There is a portion in the top right of the screen that shows you how much disc space you have left on the DVR hard drive. Even though you don't manually tell it to record, this counter decreases indicating that it is always recording.The unit times out quickly when you are not actively using the mouse. You have to keep inputting the admin password to do anything and I have yet to find anywhere where you can either disable this or increase the amount of time it takes to time out.The relationship between what the DVR is doing and what the PC/laptop is doing is very confusing. You can tell it to stop and start recording on the PC/laptop side but this only controls video being recorded to the PC/laptop and not the internal DVR drive.If you are already very familiar with how a DVR/CCTV unit and software works, you may be OK. If you are new to this interface, expect a steep learning curve and some frustration.I am giving it 3 stars because it does work but can't give it 5 because it is very confusing and lacks information on how to get the video off the DVR drive and seems to lean heavily towards the networking aspect of the device. I am using it as a stand-alone device so the only \"networking\" I am interested in is the DVR and PC/laptop seeing each other via an Ethernet cable.The PC/laptop has to have a static IP address assigned to the Ethernet port in order to communicate with the DVR. If you are familiar with how to assign your Ethernet adapter a static IP address (as well as gateway, subnet mask, etc.) in Windows this isn't bad. If you are not, again expect some frustration in getting the two devices to communicate. My advice is to dedicate a PC/laptop to interfacing with the DVR. If you are connecting it to your home use PC, you're in for a ride. When I connect the two via Ethernet, the wireless connection on my PC stops working and I have no Internet connection. When I connected it to my laptop I did have access to my wireless Internet connection for whatever reason. If you have a PC/laptop to dedicate only to interfacing with the DVR you will probably be OK. You can also bypass the computer software and connect to the DVR via HTTP web browser interface but the images are pretty small and it doesn't seem to have as much functionality as the software does.Now for my main issues with this device. When recording video via the PC/laptop interface, the video is recorded in the .AVC format. If anyone knows of a .avc to .mpeg or .avi converter I would be your best friend ever. From what I can tell the video recorded to your PC cannot be viewed in any way other than with the player that comes with the software CD.Getting the video off of the DVR is another issue entirely as I have yet to be able to figure that one out.Update: I was eventually able to figure out how to get the video recorded to the laptop converted although for the life of me I can't recall how I did it at the moment. As far as getting the video on the DVR itself off the internal drive and converted to a usable format, I'm still at a loss.The user guide mentions using a USB jump drive on the USB port of the DVR and that it has to be formatted FAT32. When I do this and try to backup data to the USB drive it sees the drive but gives an incorrect format error message.
