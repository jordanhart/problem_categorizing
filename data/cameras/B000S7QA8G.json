This is an awesome camera. IF you are just interested in point and shoot, this is a best camera you would by in the market within this type of camera.I have checked canon and sony both for this type. Both does not give features that this camera gives and not even near to the price.For Canon, its the best picture quality you would get in the market. However, it certainly fells short in shutter lag/continuous photography. For sony its reverse. Sony has some fastest camera (in point n shoot) where you can shoot continously. But it lacks in picture quality.This camera is a golden middle of both. It has a great picture quality and good response time.For this cameraPros:Great picture quality even at night with flashHD capabilityZoom while video capture.Video playback with audioIn camera editingCamera works as a charger No separate charger neededMost lacked feature in other camera.. USB charging :)Great point and shoot modes (17 scene modes)Easy navigation. Dont need a manual to read and understand features.Cons:Buttons are small for fat fingersLess manual control. If you are a advanced user in photography and wants great deal of manual control then this is NOT a camera for you.Low light pictures without flash (HIgh ISO)I tried taking pictures with high ISO in low light without flash. High ISO only adds to noise. Beyond 400, without flash its noisy.But this seems to be the problem for Sony and Canon as well in this size camera. Partly because the camera size. They want to squeeze in CCD in a smaller area. Its a sacrifice for size.Overall great camera and I have bought two of these. I havent played with it much but I will. I will keep updating this post as I learn more.If you are thinking of buying camera, give this one a try at shop. I am sure you will like it :)", "Date": "November 24, 2007"}, {"Title": "Kodak Camera", "Author": "Xergey \"Xergey\"", "ReviewID": "R1DWUN1BA2F80P", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I was looking for a new digital camera after finally destroying my underwater Pentax Optio camera after several egregious and destructive incidents and I decided to settle on this based on the price(i also got free shipping), resolution, and brand name.  Despite my terrible reasoning, I am quite impressed by this camera.  It provides excellent pictures and gives great video quality for a camera.  It has a nifty burst picture feature to take three pictures in a row and the shake stabilization/moving subject feature works well, I pretty much spun on my chair taking pictures and while they weren't stunning quality the camera was able provide a decent image, better than my previous camera anyway.  Zoom is amazing and was able to provide me with the most intense picture of my roommate's inner ear.  Criticisms:  1.  Feels kinda cheap.  I am scared to drop this thing.  2. Has issues with low light and the low light settings actually made it worse when i was testing it out, go figure.  3.  A rather long delay after the picture is taken making it hard to take multiple pics, guess that why they included the burst feature but doesn't give you as much quality.  Overall, good camera, i just wish i got the red one...", "Date": "November 10, 2007"}, {"Title": "Nothing but positivity as of now!", "Author": "WhtDaddy", "ReviewID": "R1UIYCKC23HE7U", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I have really liked this camera so far, I had a Kodak EasyShare 5mp camera before and was very satisfied besides the fact that I couldn't get audio to play with my recorded video.  Unfortunately I lost it at college so my wonderful sister bought me the new Kodak EasyShare MD853!  It takes very good moving pictures, I was taking random pictures out the window of my friends car and they none of them came out grainy or blurry.  I also zoomed form one end of my basement to the other, took a picture of my nephew and it turned out great!  Even zoomed all the way there was very little to no distortion when zooming long distances.  The video is great for a camera, very clear no \"blocky\" like the video camera on my phone. I love the rechargeable battery, my old Kodak 5mp used disposable batteries and didn't have an on/off button, it had a switch...I would always forget to switch it off and the batteries would always die.  I would get all the way to an event and realize my batteries are dead!! I don't have to worry about that with this camera.  I wish they would have used a mini USB port rather than the charging port that is on it because the mini usb accessories are very cheap(car charger, wall charger, additional usb cables) I like the fact that this is HD capable, I plan on using that feature in the future.  I would definitely recommend this camera to anyone looking for a new camera.  THE PICTURE QUALITY IS GREAT!", "Date": "December 25, 2007"}, {"Title": "Small:Yes. Easy to Use: Yes. Quality Photos: No.", "Author": "Bob MacLeod", "ReviewID": "R3N6O8OTZBN0IN", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "I travel frequently for business and was seeking an subcompact camera that I could keep in my pocket. I was attracted to this camera both by it's \"best buy\" rating in a consumer magazine and my ownership of a Kodak EasyShare camera four years ago. And at $125, it seemed like a bargain.This camera is very compact and light, and was as easy to use as my previous camera. My first impressions were positive.The quality of the photos, however, left a lot to be desired. I discovered after taking assorted shots that \"8.2 megapixels\" has little meaning in terms of the quality. Indeed, this camera's photo quality was similar to my first digital camera from way back in 2000... a 1.2 megapixel Olympus.In practical terms, only of the 100+ photos I took to test it returned what I would call \"crisp\" results, results I expect from a camera these days. Shots of groups of people were particularly fuzzy; close up shots were better, but still just \"acceptable\", not \"great\".I returned this camera and invested twice as much in a Canon PowerShot SD850. That camera is actually smaller than the Kodak, and the pictures are excellent. And, though this has no bearing on this review, the advantage of having two Canons is that I do not have to memorize two different sets of menus/formats/etc.Finally, with so many subcompacts out there, if I was limited to $125-$150, I would seek out a different camera than this one.One other comment: I admit that I may have been doing something incorrectly because I didn't study the manual before using the camera. But if a person cannot turn on a camera and take good pictures right away, then the camera will simply be an ongoing source of frustration. Also, some stranger taking a picture of me at a theme park should get as good a picture as if I was taking it.", "Date": "February 1, 2008"}, {"Title": "Very grainy picture and full of noise - Ended up returning it", "Author": "Columbus \"CC\"", "ReviewID": "R1RSNAHQNL7HA1", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I had a old Kodak 5MP from before and loved the picture quality even with some limitation in the flash quality. So I went to upgrade to M853. Wow! what a heartbreaker! This camera is nowhere close to even the one of 5MP. Very grainy pictures, lots of noise, evening shots are blurry. I wouldn't recommend it even for $149. I am planning to go back with Canon.", "Date": "December 11, 2007"}, {"Title": "Awesome camera that take beautiful pictures!", "Author": "Nicole", "ReviewID": "RKVIAADYSYG9Z", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I'm surprised by all the negative reviews!  I think the problem most people are having is that they wanted an easy camera that you could just point and shoot- this is not that camera.  You have to work with it a bit to get the right settings for the right light.  It comes taking poster sized pictures- you have to lower the size of the pictures or else it will only let you store 7 pictures.  I use the lowest setting and it still takes generously sized pictures with nice detail.  You also have to play around with it quite a bit to understand all the features.  If you want an easy point and click camera this is NOT the one for you, but if you're willing to learn how to use the camera it is pretty awesome.

It's a lot smaller than my old one and takes way better pictures too! I am the one in the family who always takes tons of pictures and of course love to share them so it's super important for me to have a reliable camera that will capture all of those special moments. This camera takes really sharp pictures and one thing I really love about it is that even if the room is dim the pictures will come out nice and bright- I love the flash on this thing.

It is also very easy to use.The downside:  you'd think that 8.2 mega pixels would mean something but it really doesn't.  Almost every picture I take is noisy, blurry and/or distorted.  You get noise just from zooming, not to mention adjusting the ISO.Almost all the buttons are way too small and the little setting wheel thing is nearly impossible to turn sometimes.It is overall a very slow camera.  You have to sit there and wait for it to auto-focus, watching the colors on the LCD screen shift, waiting for it to find what its supposed to be shooting.  If, in fact, it does, you better hope whatever you're shooting isn't moving at all because it will blur horribly.  Nor should you move your hand at all.I promise you, you will never get any motion shots with this camera.Most reviews will tell you that this camera performs poorly under low light conditions and I was shocked to find out just how severe it really is.  Unless lighting is absolutely perfect and bright, you will not get a clear photo.There are definitely better cameras out there, for just as good a price, if not better.  I traded this camera in for a Canon Powershot A560 and i couldn't be happier.  It is a much much better camera for about 20 cents more at Wal-Mart.Don't bother with this Kodak guys.", "Date": "January 8, 2008"}, {"Title": "NEVER EVER AGAIN BY KODAK", "Author": "danmack1", "ReviewID": "R34G1BEFKU691R", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "i purchased this camera kodak easy share m853 in december of 2008  i use it 8 times a year for the past 3 years today it dies i cannot recharge the battery or get the camera to work any other wayi called kodak customer support on chat thier final solution was to buy back the camera for a 15% discount on a new camera on thier website ( not the best bargan to be found ) or pay for unknown repair at unknown price to be given when i return the camera to them and they will not look at it till i give them my credit card1 year warenty expired so here i am with the un usable camera and the cost of purchasing a new camera or the unknown expence of having it repairedbut if i do purchase a new camera it will be a sony or cannon NEVER  NEVER EVER AGAIN A KODAK / kodak quality (from china) proudly sold in the USAdo your self a favor do not  purchase this camera or any other kodak camera it is a EXPENSIVE DISPOSABLE CAMERA", "Date": "May 29, 2011"}, {"Title": "Good Investment", "Author": "Amy E.

I found that the digital stabilation was a great tool, removing blurriness from \"shake\" and small movements.Many of the photos look so great, they're like postcards.  Truly, I cant believe my husband and I are the ones that took those shots.  It took great shots in many environments, night pictures in Venice, artwork in Florence, the Tuscan landscape, even the closeups of Italian gelato & desserts!!  We were also pleased with the video, again simple to use and we were thrilled with the sound that came through for a classical concert.  I would say the only problematic thing is if the sun is shining straight at the camera, and the photo is difficult to see in the camera window, use another angle because those didnt come out well.I had been hesitant in trying digital again due to the purchase of a Vivitar that was very difficult to use.  The Kodak was a joy to use and many other family members were curious about it and tried it out. Its so small & perfect for travel.I believe it was in another review on this board that I used the advise to get a different rechargeable battery which I did. And we did require recharging every couple of days (14 day trip) and took over 300 pictureswhich the bulk of were on a 1G card and then we started another card.My hope is you will find this useful in your research for a good, easy to use camera.

I was happy to buy the M853 because I expected the same quality, and because it was recommended by a leading consumer magazine. Turned out to be nowhere near as good as the last camera...even though that one was several years old! The problem lies in the picture quality. 8MP?? Really?? You'd never know it looking at the photos it takes.If you're taking shots outdoors in bright sunlight and both you and the subject (e.g. a flower) are perfectly still, the pictures come out very nice indeed. However, everything else comes out grainy, blurry and badly lit. Taking photos of my toddler, especially indoors, has been a nightmare. Half my photos have to be deleted because they are blurry. And they come out blurry even when the subject is sitting fairly still. Basically, this camera cannot handle any movement at all.Second issue: Red eye is a HUGE problem with this camera. I am constantly fixing red eye in my pics. It is driving me nuts.Third issue: slow, slow, slow. This camera takes forever to focus, and sometimes requires a break of several seconds to -- I don't know -- process or something. Anyway, all this means I have lost great picture-taking opportunities time after time. Very frustrating!Other problems: the camera is small and slippery with nothing for the fingers to grip onto for stability. As others have noted, it feels/looks a bit cheap. Also, the control dial on top is tiny and spins too easily. The controls overall are small and difficult to use...and I am a woman with smallish fingers.Bear in mind I am an enthusiastic digital camera user. Nope, I'm no expert, but I enjoy taking photos, I'm careful with my cameras, and I always read the instructions. I am used to getting excellent results with a simple point-and-shoot like this.Shopping around? I urge you to consider another camera and give this a miss. Kodak: you've lost a customer.
