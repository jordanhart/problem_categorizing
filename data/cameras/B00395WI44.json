I've always loved the Panasonic Lumix so I thought I'd try this little inexpensive one to replace my SD card Lumix (the download times were killing me without SDHC). This is a great little camera. It's much better than cell phone cameras. The download speed is great. Pictures are good. The shutter speed is a noticeably slower indoors than my SLR, but hey, this is a point and shoot. It had many settings you can pick from and some neat functions-I haven't played with them all yet. The video quality is really good (better than my video camera). However, video IS a memory hog (the camera says my empty 4GB card will hold 4 minutes of video). But hey, for a quick little camera-it does really good. I'm still very impressed by Panasonic and they are my top choice. Couldn't beat Amazon's price either. LOVE the colors!!!", "Date": "January 11, 2011"}, {"Title": "Nothing but Panasonic", "Author": "C. Reich", "ReviewID": "R34Y9U6QRD8P9E", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This is my fourth or fifth Panasonic camera or video recorder of some kind. I got this one for my 11 year old daughter. With a small amount of instruction she was able to use most of the features like a pro. My ONLY, ONLY, ONLY complaint about Panasonic is the battery issue. EVERY SINGLE STINKING Panasonic camera has a DIFFERENT battery. They can vary by .01 inches and 1 amp, but they can not be used across multiple platforms. Otherwise, Panasonic cameras take great pictures and are easy to use. I have one that is 6 years old and I have drug it all over the world. It still works great.", "Date": "January 16, 2011"}, {"Title": "Great little camera.", "Author": "Kathryn R.

I can't say anything negative unless you are looking to take pictures from a great distance. Then you would need more optical, like 15X. Otherwise, this is a great item! Movie mode is also very good for a camera of this size. Also, nice and thin to fit in your pocket! Would highly recommend!", "Date": "September 12, 2010"}, {"Title": "PANASONIC LUMIX DMC-FH1 12.1 MP DIGITAL CAMERA", "Author": "METHA L WEBER", "ReviewID": "R1DRRUVTVX3MA8", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I LOVE THE SIMPLICITY YET WITH FEATURES, AND I DON'T HAVE TO KNOW HOW TO DO ANYTHING BUT POINT AND I CAN BUY REPLACEMENT PARTS FROM PANASONIC EASILY.", "Date": "July 15, 2013"}, {"Title": "Excellent camera!", "Author": "Supercalifragilisticexpialidocious", "ReviewID": "R1GJ9GOOLEJO56", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I love taking pictures, but I didn't want to spend a fortune on a new camera. This one looked nice and had great features, for the low price. I love the scene modes you can pick from, and the wide-angle lens. Such a great purchase!

I would use it more, but I am not man enough to use a bright pink camera.

Taking a picture of your face is not clear just smeary. You couldn't see your pores or any definition on your face. Flash on the face is over exposed. Really blurry. Don't Buy. I researched on here for a good panasonic camera that is small. I chose this one and am extremely disappointed.

I had considered buying a Lumix before having always had NikonDigital cameras previously. I was pleasantly surprised with the quality of photos.I am not sure about the video mode being hand held and giving smooth videos though.The videos are quite choppy but that may be my problem. When used on a tripod, the videos aregreat. The pictures are good and the color balance is also very good. For a small pocket  camerathis camera works very well.", "Date": "January 12, 2011"}, {"Title": "Lumix Panasonic wonderful camera absolutely", "Author": "C.

I had been using an old 4 pixel digitial bought for me some years back, but this camera is amazing.You can choose how big a photo you want to take/ for email / for 11x14 enlargements etc.  Its so lightweight and also had wide angle on it, and I cannot imagine how incredible the other Lumix is, if this one is so great..It takes photos of my artwork wonderfully, even with glass when you stand a bit to the side..WOW !!!", "Date": "January 9, 2011"}, {"Title": "Amazing Product", "Author": "Headhunter", "ReviewID": "RAGHEQQJ8WRBK", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "It is an excellent product, I am very satisfied with the purchase you make.

I had been looking for a cheap (under 100 bucks) pocket camera.  While I usually use my Nikon D80 for the special photos, it's too bulky and expensive to carry around, and it doesn't take video.  I'm so happy I bought the Lumix DMC-FH1 as a backup everyday camera.  The quality of the HD video is amazing!  Now when my baby does something cute I have it right there and I don't miss a thing.  The widescreen photos are also nice, as well as the \"soft skin\" scene mode for those wrinkles - better than botox.", "Date": "January 7, 2011"}, {"Title": "can not take clear photos", "Author": "W.

It takes very nice clear pictures, and doesnt have a long delay or bright flash while taking picture.  Its just right in size, its small and light weight.

The size is great for that, and she loved the pink color.  However, the on/off switch is too easily moved and so the camera is always turning on in her bag.  The main problem is that it extends the lens and opens the built-in lens cover.  So then the exposed lens is hitting against other things in her bag and getting filled with lint.I'm not impressed with the low light capability and the flash is pretty weak, but it is by far the smallest camera I've owned.  I've not compared to other cameras of the same size.", "Date": "May 14, 2010"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": "Unavailable", "Features": "12.1-megapixel effective recording\n5X optical zoom\n2-11/16\" LCD screen\nOptical image stabilization\nWide-angle lens for shooting landscapes and large groups", "Name": "Panasonic Lumix DMC-FH1 12.1 MP Digital Camera with 5x Optical Image Stabilized Zoom and 2.7-Inch LCD (Pink)", "ImgURL": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41QFoQom6OL._SX300_.jpg", "ProductID": "B00395WI44"}}
