This lens is really great built and takes the photo crisps and clear. Good zoom options , image stability is excellent , I shoot the video while driving on rough road and captured many birds properly. Tried with High ISO for taking full moon and I could capture all black spots of the moon very well.Did not give 5 star to it because of one reason the bulky feature on a very light small camera NEX5n . The lens obscure the flash , so you need a flash mount if you want to avoid the lens coming in way.So overall a good lens for long zoom and also macro shooting , portrait also came good.", "Date": "December 19, 2012"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": "$909.95", "Features": "Sony Alpha SEL18200 E-mount 18-200mm F3.5-6.3 OSS Lens for NEX Cameras\n16 Gigabyte SD Secure Digital Memory Card\nSony NP-FW50 Lithium Ion Battery Pack\nLens Carrying Pouch with Drawstring\nLens Pen Cleaning Tool", "Name": "Sony Alpha SEL18200 E-mount 18-200mm F3.5-6.3 OSS Lens for NEX Cameras + Acce...", "ImgURL": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51Cd%2Bdg-lsL._SY300_.jpg", "ProductID": "B00578IF1G"}}
