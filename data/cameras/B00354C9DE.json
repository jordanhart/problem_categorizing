{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Good but needs off switch and compatibility with prev model (240) is less than indicated", "Author": "ams", "ReviewID": "RA58N08T4GJ5Y", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "I had the previous model (240 I think is the number) and sure enough it started giving the end of life signal 5 years after the house was built. I am second owner so took a while to find what was beeping (once every 5 minutes) and then by dumb luck I hit the test button and it quieted it. Turns out this is a documented feature and quiets the end of life alert for 36 hours.. I mention in case someone else may run across this and it helps them... Because it took me several days to give up and look for replacement and then wind my way to the manual.These hard-wired detectors really need an on/off switch.This is a replacement model and GE even offers a $10 cover that is the old size to save painting - although $10 seems pretty steep for this type of part.. Nonetheless, it sounded like it may be have been designed as a straight-forward swap. I saw nothing other than a minor wiring change in the DYI boards so I ordered with high hopes.This is not the case though so be prepared:1) The mount holes are totally different so you will need to drill. I just used top one and seems secure enough.2) The wires come in on the other side of the beam unless you turn it upside down, but, the configuration of the new holes don't look conducive to turning updside down, IMO..  Not sure how one would deal with this if you have the wires on one side of beam behind the dry wall. I did not have dry wall to deal with but you may, so just mentioning.3) The final incompatibility generated lots of chatter on the DYI boards and is a new feature (circuit in the detector) that requires slightly different wiring to your alarm system. This is probably an upgrade and good so I will not knock it, however, just another thing different, to learn about and deal with. You may need to do slight re-wire. I lucked out and could leave the feature out but you may not be able to do this if your current detector is wired to the NO (Normally Open) bank of your security system.The instructions were only given for systems that are wired NO. After I poured over the wiring instructions for a couple of hours and figured out how this was interfacing I went to install and found mine used an NC hook up... That may not be the preferred install but that is how it was and not being a security system expert I decided to leave it. Leaving out the new circuit, the installation ended up to be a fairly easy swap, but I sure wasted a lot of time and angst prep'ing for it. So you may want to check your current wiring out beforehand.If your current wiring is compatible with instructions and you want/need to wire in the new circuit, looks like you will just need an extra piece of wire.As for the End Of Life alert. This will go off in 6 years and I have to say I am not looking forward to it on this new model. The old model beeped twice every five minutes and you can turn off for 36 hours if you know the secret method. This was livable until I got it replaced. Five minutes is annoying but not immediate so once I heard it I could go down at my leisure and turn off... This was nice and would have been nicer had I had the instructions or better yet if there was an on/off switch.The new model is \"even more secure\" as it beeps every fifteen seconds for EOL so you hear it and cannot ignore it... This is great to find the alarm and check it out, but once found it is over the line of annoyance every 36 hours IMO. Personally I think all these hard-wired devices have all gone over the line and need an on/off switch so normal human beings don't have to call emergency services or vacate their home due to noise when these things malfunction - which is far from a rare occurrence I have had this 2 times in 2 years - not this particular detector, but this would have been the third had I not surreptitiously hit upon hitting the test button...All in all this unit it is a replacement for the old and the circuitry seems to allow for a robust and sophisticated alarm system security hook up.

The earlier detector was installed by our builder in the course of an addition/renovation.  I didn't know these detectors have finite life spans until the intermittent beeping started. I would rate my mechanical/electrical aptitude as average, but by carefully examining the wiring of the existing failed detector before removing it, and comparing that to the wiring diagrams that come with the Model 250-CO, I was able to install the new detector and wire it in to our home security system panel and complete a successful test.  Unless you actually have a carbon monoxide leak it's hard to comment further on how good this unit is.  I hope no one buying one of these ever needs to find out...", "Date": "December 25, 2010"}, {"Title": "Installing a GE 250-CO Made So Easy Thanks to Amazon Reviewers", "Author": "genuinely_a", "ReviewID": "R37KZWGDGHBC1C", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "We reviewed several previous posts with installation feedback, and understood that the old 240-C0 was discontinued, and that the 250-CO was different internally, bulkier, designed upright as opposed to sideways and their wiring was not all isolated to one side of the unit as with the 240 model.  I called our security company to see if there was any other alternative to the old 240-CO and the answer was no, you have to use the 250-CO.  So we ordered 4 of them and did not get the GE adapter panel they offer as it is 3 times the size of the unit itself and is only used to cover up the holes.  It makes the CO detector a focal point on a wall, which is not what we wanted, so we opted to fill in the holes and touch up since we still have paint.Also for anyone who experiences the obnoxious beeping in the future when an old unit expires, our security company instructed us to take wire cutters, remove the cover of the expired unit and snip the red wire.  They said that this would remove power from the unit, but not set off an alarm.  Since we had 4 units in the house, they all expired within a week of one another so this was good to know especially when one decided to expire in the middle of the night.First we called our security company and asked them to take us offline for a few hours since we weren't quite sure how long it would take us to replace 4 units.  The security company tech support rep also instructed me to unplug either the red or black battery wires to our security system and then unplug the power supply from the wall, in that order. We have a main security box on the wall and a separate CO box that both have batteries, so she asked us to disconnect both batteries and both power supplies.  Once the utility boxes are opened, there were dozens of terminal hookups which was a bit intimidating but we ignored them and just looked for the red and black wires connected to the battery.  Our batteries were black and look similar to a miniature car battery.  They were turned sideways in the utility boxes, and the red wire was closest, so we unplugged the red wires from the batteries.  The Tech support rep said it didn't matter which one we unplugged. Then she instructed us to unplug the power supplies from the wall.We then took one reviewers advice and wrote down on paper which of the 4 wires in the 240-CO were connected where.  If you pop off the cover of the old CO-240, you'll see 4 colored wires.  They are connected to 2 banks of terminals.  On the top is a blue bank of 3 terminals labeled NO, COM and NC.  On the bottom is a blue bank of 2 terminals labled GND and +12V.  The wires coming into the terminals were green, yellow, black and red.  The security company rep confirmed that the bottom bank of terminals were for power, red was positive and black was negative.  On the 240-CO, our black wire was connected to \"GND\" which we assumed meant \"ground\" and the red wire was connected to the terminal labeled \"+12V\".This is where the previous product reviewers advice differs and we are assuming it is because we all have different security systems/features/panels, etc..  On the old 240-CO, above the power wires are the security system wires, a bank of 3 terminals.  They are labeled from top to bottom on the 240 model NO, COM, NC.  We noted from the reviews that some reviewers used the NO and COM terminals while others used NC and COM and still others used NC and NO for the green and yellow wires.  So we took note of how ours were connected.  Our old 240-CO had the yellow wire connected to NC and the green wire connected to COM.Even though the reviewers use of terminals was different, we felt that if we used the same terminals as on the 240-CO on the 250-CO it should work and this is what previous reviewers had done as well.  We started with the first location.  On the new model 250-CO, the terminals are also on on top of one another but now the power bank of terminals is on the top.  There is a 4 bank bay of terminals, labeled T, T, + , and - .  The lower bank of 3 terminals now has the NC, COM and NO terminal bays, but they are 2 inches away from the power terminal bay.  This may sound confusing just reading it, but if you open the new 250-CO and follow along, you will see exactly what I mean.  And this is what most reviewers complain about - they didn't put the terminal bays close to one another which requires you to strip your main wire to expose more length of the red/black/yellow/green wires.  We had a wire stripper but found it easier to use an Exacto knife and gently stripped some of the main wire coming out of the wall, about 2 additional inches so we could split the red/black and yellow/green wires to get them into the right places.  We fed them through the back of the unit and before connecting the wires, positioned the unit on the wall.  We did not experience any issue with leftover wiring as one reviewer mentioned, as we installed the unit directly over the old wire hole.  Instead of trying to use the screw mounting holes which would require we strip more wire, we decided to just position it as close to the main wiring hole in the wall as possible which allowed the unit to fit flush against the wall.  Just because of how our old units were originally installed, it looked very weird in relationship to the corner of the wall and the light switch to put them off to the side and use one of the old screw holes for mounting so we just screwed the old screws in where the unit looked best.  I was going to have to spackle one hole anyway and a second hole was very little additional work.  We used a small nail punch to start a screw hole and the old screws went right into the sheet rock - we never used a drill, just used the punch to start a pinhole and the screws went right in.Because we had snipped our red wires initially to stop the alarm when the units expired we had to also strip those wires back slightly to screw into the new terminals.  We found that using the Exacto knife to strip the wires was easier for us as we could not get the wire stripper to work without severing the wire as it was so tiny.There are two tiny silver plates underneath each terminal screw.  We loosened each screw and placed the raw copper wire between the two plates for each corresponding terminal and screwed them down.  So on the new model, our power wires, the red and then the black were on the top bank, and below that, the yellow was in the NC terminal and the green in the COM terminal.  Remember the terminals you use may be different than ours depending on how your old 240-CO is wired.  We aligned the cover carefully and snapped it back on - it was a little tricky because the small clear plastic light dome piece kept falling out.We then went back to the utility room, reconnected the batteries and plugged in the power supplies.  We pressed the \"test\" button on the unit.  The red alarm button beeps twice and then goes green and confirms that the system is installed properly.  We then disconnected the batteries again, unplugged the power supplies and went through the house and finished the other 3.  Once we did the first one, the others were a snap.Don't be intimidated.  It took us 25 minutes to install the first one, just because we didn't have the right tools together - we used a tiny flat head to screw and unscrew terminal wires, a regular philips head screwdriver for the mounting screws, a small nail punch to start the mounting screw holes and an Exacto knife to split the wires.  My husband used a level for his installations, but I used a ruler, measuring the distance to the corner of the wall from the unit's top and bottom which worked great since he was using the level and might help you to know if you don't have a level to use.  After that, it was like clockwork and my husband and I split up, went throughout the house and did the other 3.  It took us both of us about 10 minutes each to install the other 3.I wanted to write this to help customers who run into the same situation in the future.  Our security company would have charged us approximately $800-1000 to replace these.  It was well worth the savings to take a few minutes and figure this out.  Between my reading previous reviews, ordering the detectors, phone calls to the security company and the install, it probably took a total of 2 hours of my time.

Beware of the following issues, particularly if you are installing it as a replacement and/or mounting it on a solid surface:First, the power terminals and alarm relay terminals are separated by several inches. If your existing wiring is somewhat short lengthed, you may need to splice in additional lengths of wire to reach the second set of terminals.The relay terminals adjacent to the power terminals are NOT the alarm relay terminals. They are for a trouble signal in monitored installations.There are no break-out tabs to allow entrance of surface wiring. While it\u2019s not a big deal to nibble out an opening in the thin plastic shell, it shows a failure in design.If you are mounting over a wire access hole in a wall or over a junction box, you also may not have enough wire length to reach both sets of terminals.When you attach the power terminals' wires the status LED will glow green for a few seconds and then go out. This will likely happen while you are tightening the second power terminal screw making you think that the tightening somehow caused the LED to go out. Actually, the normal status green LED lights initially for just a few seconds and then goes into a 15 sec. flash mode. If you are not aware of how the LED operates, you may wonder if the device died after being powered on.The multicolor LED is actually a thin flat surface mounted LED on the circuit board. There is a clear plastic piece that transmits the light up from that LED to a cutout in the device cover. This is not secured in any way but just sits there. Before you start your installation, temporarily remove it. Otherwise it will fall out during the installation and you\u2019ll end wasting time looking all over the floor for this clear piece of plastic.Last, even just snapping the cover back on is annoying because it will likely depress the test button with the alarm sounding and LED flashing red.

The instructions say to mount it at least 5 ft off the floor and away from any airflow. This can be make installation location difficult. I researched these requirements and could not find any sound reason you could not mount a couple ft off the floor. After all, most plug in ones are at that level. I expect it has to do with children / pets as everything I read on the density of the gasses stated that carbon monoxide mixes well with oxygen in the air, so mounting on the ceiling or near the floor makes no difference as it will get to the detector. It really depends on what government agency or installer directions you read. Now if you are not thoroughly confused by the above as I was, I'll move on. I chose to mount it about plug height. If you intend on using the relay in the detector to trip your alarm panel (which I expect this is why you chose this model to look at) you will need 4 conductor 18 gauge in wall rated wire. 2 for the + - voltage and two for the relay contacts. Also be aware if you are flush mounting this unit, and need to connect power and relay contacts, you need 2 holes in the wall as the design of this thing was not thinking of the installer who is flush mounting. You cannot get a pair of wires to both sets of terminals from the same hole. This thing was meant to be mounted in a box with the whole underside exposed. You can simply drill 2 holes, or do what I did and cut a thin channel underneath in the wall to get the wires into the next compartment. In my panel I needed a 1K resistor across the zone with the zone set to gas. If your panel shows CO detector \"not secure\" choose the other relay terminal as it will either be NO or NC. I used 12v switched power from the panel. Upon testing you need to hold the test button in for about a 4 count till you hear the relay click. You should then hear the panel sounder go off. If the siren goes off , make sure you don't have the internal sounder set to \"burglar\" because it will only go off under those conditions. Set it to \"interior sounder\" It does have a local piezo sounder on the unit, but older people will not hear if they have any impairments. As you get older this frequency cannot be heard by many.

There is enough clearance for the wire and only the outer jacket needs to be removed if the original installer did not remove enough.  Remember to contact alarm company if it is a monitored system as removal of old detector will trigger an alarm mode. Only reason I did not rate 5 stars was that GE could have used the same footprint on new model to eliminate need for new mounting holes or adapter plate.  I'm repainting this area anyway so I'll just plug the old holes and paint.

I then screwed the detector directly back onto the drywall; it isn't heavy so it held fine but it did leave one screw hole visible in the wall.

GE fails again to follow through with intelligent engineering: creating an updated version of a device with no regard for their customers who need to upgrade to a newer unit with a different footprint to the orignial one they are replacing and designing the new one with no forethought as the com terminals on the new unit are physically separate from the power terminals so you have to splice the wire wide due to the stupid new design unlike the original 240 that was more logical with all the terminals in close proximity.

Kirk", "ReviewID": "R1ECUW9Z5X44D4", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "Like many of you, I bought this as a carbon monoxide alarm replacement to the GE-240 COe alarm that came with my ADT alarm system. After 5 years of use, my wife and I lost an entire night of sleep after the GE-240 COe went off at 1AM and kept beeping every 6 minutes. We knew it was a false alarm because we had another carbon monoxide alarm in the same room and others that we brought in just to check.At first, I thought it was one of our smoke detectors so I replaced all of the batteries there but the carbon monoxide detector wouldn't stop beeping at us, so in frustration, I disconnected the wires. That did the trick, but unfortunately rendered the ADT system unable to re-arm itself unless you go through a series of steps each time to remove the fault before resetting the alarm (a major inconvenience.) ADT alarms are set up to scan for the carbon monoxide detector so it won't easily allow you to rearm the unit until it finds one on the system.To remove that feature and allow the ADT alarm to work again without having to install another carbon monoxide detector, here is what you have to do:1)  Remove power to the ADT unit by going to the box that powers the system.  Once there, you have to disconnect one of the power wires to a black box sitting in there which is the battery backup. Once you have done that, then you remove the power cord that goes to the box. This will power down the system.2)  After removing the faulty carbon monoxide detector until from the wall - you should have four wires connected to the device - 1 yellow, 1 blue, 1 red, and 1 black.  You will need to join the yellow and blue wires either with a wire connector if you have one or black electrical tape making sure both wires are twisted together.  Then you need to separate the black and red wires (the power source) by wrapping either a wire connector on each one separately or by electrical tape. When you are done, you should have both the blue and yellow wires connected together (by tape or wire connector) and the red and black wires separate each with the exposed wire covered by electrical tape or by a screw connector.3)  After all connections are made as explained above, then you power up the ADT unit again first by putting the battery on and then restoring the power. Once you do that, the ADT system will start up again, but you will no longer have a fault and can now rearm the system again like nothing happened.Ideally, you should have a carbon monoxide detector in the room, so replace it with one you can easily replace every few years instead of having it attached to your ADT security system this way. The fact these alarms must be replaced every five years is a major inconvenience when having another alarm is fairly convenient and more cost effective.I hope that helps!", "Date": "October 18, 2012"}, {"Title": "Works fine, GE could have made it a lot easier for those of us coming from a 240 though!", "Author": "N. Reuter \"AlpineZone Skier\"", "ReviewID": "RKV9VB50Z80OB", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Like most, I had a CO-240 Safeair carbon monoxide detector installed in my house when I moved in back in 2006. Starting last week, my basement CO detector started beeping every four or five minutes. I was completely perplexed as the old CO-240 makes no indication of what that beeping represents. Googling it, I identified that a blinking green light and the beeping means that the unit has \"expired\" and needed to be replaced. I didn't realize this before, but CO detectors have a life span of about five - six years.So, off I go to Amazon to find a replacement. Of course, the Safeair 240 is no longer made. They are now manufactured under GE 250-CO. The main differences are visual (the 250CO is vertical and the 240CO was horizontal) and electrical (the 250-CO has many more connectinos on the inside). Unfortunately, they are designed completely differently and it's not even close to a plug and play. First off, the terminals are split in the device now, which makes it difficult to connect without either a) jamming the wires underneath the cover or b) drilling new holes in the wall, splitting up your alarm connections, and pulling only the necessary wires through the necessary holes.I'm still trying to figure out how to wire mine. I'm not an electrician and frankly the diagram in the box might as well be a NASA design for a rocket booster. What I wish they had in the box was a simple page that showed, \"If you had your wires connected here, here, and here in the 240, plug them in here, here, and here in the 250\". That would make installation a whole lot easier.Overall, while it works fine, I dock GE a star simply because they could have made the transition (that anyone with a CO-240 is going to HAVE to go through) a hell of a lot easier than they did.
