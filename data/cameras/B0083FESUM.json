{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Good Camera.", "Author": "Kwolf", "ReviewID": "R2NGO5DWI2GKR4", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "First let me say I would like to give this product a 3 and half stars, not quite a four.  Since I can't do that, I'm rounding up to a four.  It's a pretty good little camera.  I'm definitely not a professional photographer by any stretch.  I usually carry around a larger point and shoot camera, with long range optical zoom lenses for wildlife and nature.I really wanted a little camera though, that I could fit in my pocket and just take with me.  Something that could go in a canoe or kayak without worry.  So I wanted a small more \"rugged\" camera.  I wanted one that could shoot 1080 video also. This camera kinda came within those parameters while still being a bit more cheap than others.I really don't plan to stick it under water too much.  Yet I did that right away.  Mainly cause I knew if I didn't do it at first, I would be scared to get it wet.  I set it in a glass bowl of water, let it record video for about 2-3 minutes.  Afterward I bounced the bowl a bit and bumped it around.  Then took it out.  Worked perfectly fine.  Since then I took it out in a rainstorm and used it there.  Had no problems with the water proof seal so far.The audio in video is a bit messy, but I expected such.  Given it is water proof.  It picks up the slightest sounds, but it has a slight almost muffled quality to it.  Still works pretty nice. It takes decent to good pictures most of the time.  The auto focus is a bit cagey.  I found when taking pictures in dusty or rainy environments, it likes to auto focus on the dust or rain more than the actual targets.It may not take pictures like a 300-400 dollar camera, but over all if you want something to toss in your pocket/kayak/canoe/backpack/ or whatever just to take anywhere.  I would say this is a pretty decent little camera.  It has a metal lip on the base of the camera too, that you can fasten a good string or tie to it.  Which is handy, and it feels pretty sturdy.  Over all I really like the camera for what it is.  I would say the rating for it should vary on it's price.  If you can get it for under or around 150, it's a good four star camera.  If your paying more it's somewhere between three and four for the price.  Still if you want something to just keep around and take places and not worry about, it has done the job so far.  Pretty good little camera.", "Date": "May 13, 2013"}, {"Title": "Leaked and broke 2nd day of use", "Author": "Steve", "ReviewID": "RCF6G0X6VHUBF", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "We bought this camera and was impressed with the size of the camera, photo options, and the zoom.The charger is not that great, due to the fact that the prongs do not fold down, so this can take up room in your travel bag, they can be removed from the charger, but you still have this awkward \"T\" prong that can't be neatly tucked away.CONS:Camera leaked on the 2nd use (day of trip).  What a POS!! took video and pictures in water, beach etc (picture quality is ok - bit washed out).On the 2nd day - the camera was in my bathing suit pocket in the pool.  pulled it out to take a video and some picture - got a few shots off then \"Memory Card Error\" came across screen. turned it off and on - still got the error message.  Then it would not shut off at all.  had to take out battery and memory card.  I notice that they were a little wet, and then I saw condensation on the lenses and lcd screen.. GAME OVER.even though there are 2 locks on this camera, and one can not be closed without the other being latched - it still leaked.I just returned my camera, or will have to use Credit Card protection.  I don't want Fuji to repair this - if it breaks after 2 days of use... I have no faith the company will give me a camera that last.  not fun to have your camera die during your trip.", "Date": "June 27, 2013"}, {"Title": "Leaked and not working after use in only 12 inches of water", "Author": "B'more doc.", "ReviewID": "RQRNQSVNGS1DQ", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I bought this as a second camera because of its \"Wateproof\" claim, just to take photos in and around the water as we love to take beach vacations. On our 1st beach vacation it worked fine after getting splashed by sea water, except that the latches became stiff to open and close. This was in spite of rinsing it off with fresh water and allowing it to fully dry before opening it. However on our second beach vacation, after still working fine in the surf getting splashed for the 1st 3 days, I decided to get some underwater photos of my sons snorkeling while I was standing holding the camera about 12 inches under the water. I double checked the latches prior to this. It took about 15 seconds of video then stopped working. After allowing it to dry completely it came back on. However it vibrates on its own, the flash goes off on its own, and everything looks blue. Fortunately nothing on the flash card was lost, but I had downloaded the photos and videos daily as a precaution anyway. Do not buy this camera. I will start searching for another. I wasted my money as it is too late to return it.", "Date": "August 9, 2013"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": "$229.95", "Features": "14MP CMOS\nHigh Quality Fujinon 5x Optical Zoom Lens\n4-Proof Protection: Waterproof 33', Shockproof 6.5', Freezeproof 14*, Dustproof\nFull HD Movies\nInnovative Wireless Image Transfer function", "Name": "Fujifilm XP170 Compact Digital Camera with 5xOptical Zoom Lens - Blue", "ImgURL": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41dRZAQyroL._SX300_.jpg", "ProductID": "B0083FESUM"}}
