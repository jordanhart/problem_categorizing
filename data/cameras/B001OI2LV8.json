{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Everything I wanted and needed in a camera", "Author": "Petra", "ReviewID": "R2CC765TE1TVB7", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I am no expert when it comes to photography but enjoy taking good pictures of my family and friends. I have kids in sports and I like to take my own pictures for picture giving. I read many reviews (for hours) on various cameras and endet up with this one here. I first was going to get the DSC-H50 (one step up from the DSC-H20). When I went to the store to buy it, however, it was to large for my taste. It was to big to fit in a pants pocket and even for my small purse it was quite large. Here are the main reasons why this camera is awesome!This camera here is not as compact as your typical slim camera (due to the 10x zoom), but it is small enough to fit in a purse or even a jacket/pants pocket if need be.This camera has a burst mode so you can hold down the shutter and the camera will take numerous pictures, thus making it ideal for action shots. I took it to a Volleyball tournament and got unbelievable shots of my daughter serving and hitting! I cought her in mid air more then a few times...just what I had hoped for. I also took pictures at a track meet and got kids jumping hurdles...the pictures look almost like magazine shots!This camera is extremely easy to use in the easy and auto adjust mode! It tells you everything on the screen. You can start shooting pretty much right away...it's that easy! The manual is good to have for reference and questions and if you really want to get to know your camera.The zoom is great and plenty! I took pictures from the mezzanine onto the Volleyball courts and could get nice close up shots! 10x is plenty for me!The battery life is also impressive, as long as you keep your screen on a regular bright setting. First I had it set to \"bright\" and the battery didn't do well. Then I set it to normal and it lasts a long time. I took about 150 shots and not a single bar was missing from the battery!It has a rechargebale battery so you don't have to keep buying regular batteries. Also, it does say that you can get a international charger so the battery charger can be plugged in anywhere in the world. (Still have to get that myself). What a nice option.The quality of the pictures is also great! I took a team photo and my daughter took it to a practice to show the others. They choose the picture to use in a frame as a gift to the coaches. It turned out so good and all I did was push a button!When shooting pictures, it has a option for the file size you select. If you know you want to email pictures, or for example if you sell on eBay and want to download pictures onto the ebay site, you select the small file size and shoot pictures that way for working with them online. For pictures that you use for portraits for example, you choose a larger file (pixels I guess), and that way it does not distort the picture when you enlarge it. That is also extremely easy to figure out!Last but not least...I plugged it into my pc with the supplied USB cord and retrieved the photos the same way I always did in the past. I have not yet added the picture cd that came with it, but my guess is that it will work very good. I also took the 2GB SD card to Wal mart and made nice prints (you have to purchase the pro duo stick seperate...look for the \"Sony pro-Duo Stick\" cost about $13-$15). The 2 GB is plenty for me, I think it holds about 400 pictures).Great camera...I have not found a flaw yet!", "Date": "May 13, 2009"}, {"Title": "mostly pleased", "Author": "sheeroses \"sheeroses\"", "ReviewID": "R3BT5EZPF18W46", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "After much research and trying out a few cameras (Panasonic Zs1 being its main competitor) I am settling for this sony H20. The picture quality in the H20 was just much more clear. The Panasonic Lumix Zs1 had inconsistent performance and I found some pictures to be very grainy and unpleasing. I was lured in by the Panasonic's wide angle lens and several scene selection modes, but in the end none of those matter if your picture is grainy and not of printable quality. The biggest positive about this camera is its consistently good picture quality and performance. I took this camera with me to Southeast Asia and was able to get good pictures out of a moving car and at all zooms both indoors and outdoors. I was able to get some stunning pics with the lumix but only at times and for each good pic I had about 20 bad ones, and when your traveling or trying to capture a moment you just don't have time to shoot 20-30 frames to get a good one. For this Sony camera to be truly perfect I really wish it had a wide angle lens, a panoramic assist function (like the Sony HX1 which is much bigger and not much better pic quality but the panoramic function is incredible), a more compact design with a built in lens cap and flash so the cap doesn't pop off every time you take a picture. I looked and looked for the perfect camera and with those added features this would be it, but for now I will settle for this camera and hopefully sony will add those functions and improve this camera in its next upgrade. If you are looking for a compact travel camera that is several steps up from the normal 3x zoom and takes consistently good crisp pictures in various settings I would recommend this camera. It is not nearly as bulky as DSLRs making it a very easy travel companion, and it takes better pics than the other competing cameras in its range as well as some mega zoom cameras.UPDATE: November 2009-Before I left on my trip to Turkey and Europe I ended up purchasing another camera, the Canon Sx10is. This camera was more expensive and bigger both things I was initially trying to fight against, but I am so glad I went for this extra investment because the pictures I have been able to take on my trip (panoramic and regular) have come out absolutely stunning, all on auto setting, and using the panoramic assist function. It is a little bulkier then the sony but it still fits in my purse and the results in the pic quality are incredible.I figure I will probably not come back to these places and get the opportunity to take stunning pics again, so the slightly more money and bulk ended up being no bother when I will have very memorable pictures to look back on my trips. Look for my review and uploaded pics on the canon powershot page. If you can afford it and can take slightly more bulk, this camera ended up being the ultimate winner for me, and was everything I was trying to force the sony to be. I wanted to offer this option to those who are looking for something a little more then the sony has to offer. check out this canon before deciding.", "Date": "August 28, 2009"}, {"Title": "Great Camera!! Best Value!!!", "Author": "TechGeek", "ReviewID": "R127IPWNGZ0S5E", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I bought this camera for a two week trip I was about to take. I also purchased an extra extended battery and an 8GB memory card for the camera. The main reason I purchased the camera was for its ability to take pictures quickly. I looked through consumer reports and this one was one of the top rated cameras. The cost is very good for this quality camera. I could take a picture withing a couple of seconds after turning the camera on and I could take a picture again less than a second later. This camera also has great battery life. Even if you just use the included battery, you can still get around 3-400 pictures (assuming you are not using flash). The zoom on the camera is great. It is a 10x optical zoom and additional 7x digital zoom. This gives you the power of a 17x zoom. If you take your picture at 17x zoom, you can then zoom in on your picture another 8x under the \"review your pictures\" menu. This camera is also small enough to fit into a small over the shoulder camera bag. It fit into my old camera bag that I used to have a small Olympus camera in. I recommend this camera for ages 16 and up. It is a great camera that it comparable to any SLR camera. I think it is better than a SLR because it is so much smaller than any SLR you could purchase.", "Date": "May 12, 2009"}, {"Title": "Superb photos and for a lot less than the ZS3 / TZ-7", "Author": "Rayaz", "ReviewID": "R3J3YQWXMKSGCM", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "After going through 2 generations of the lumix TZ series (TZ3 and TZ4) which served well as multi purpose cameras, I wanted a multi-purpose camera that also had better video quality and superior low light capabilities. Here is my why not others comparison (it may not match with your needs, but it might help some of you)Panasonic Lumix ZS1 / TZ6 vs Sony H20Lower quality video (same as  WVGA resolution as the TZ4), and could not adapt to the different lighting conditions like its higher model TZ7 (something that Panasonic does not mention clearly so be vary).Panasonic ZS3 / TZ7 vs Sony H20Unfortunately seems to have fallen prey to its high reviews with the price at $399 (even with weekend discounts it was around $340).Panasonic has decided to clam on cheap batteries, so you can't use OEM batteries with the latest firmware (needed as it supposedly fixes the autofocussing issue in videos).  This mean you need to bust out 50-60$ for a spare battery, and since the new battery is smaller than the one's used in the previous models, you need the spare.[Update] Price has dropped considerably, but the battery prices still remain ridiculously high.  After market batteries that work around the chipping proof logic seem to be available but no guarantee if they will work, so not worth the hassle.  One more issue i came across after i tried the unit was that Class 6 SDHC is not good enough to record video in high quality and you need to spend loads of $$ and get high speed SDHC if you want to record in high quality :(Canon SX200 vs Sony H20The canon SX200 though having good picture quality and full manual controls was out simply because it does not have optical zoom in videos.Samsung WB550 vs Sony H20Optics that match the Lumix TZ7 in spec, and yet offering all what the Sony has to offer, so in theory its the camera that's the all rounderBut the reviews highlighted the picture quality was not very good and had the purple fringing problemUncertain quality of samsung camera (Since the samsung mobile phones are a bit low on reliability from experience)Therefore i came to the conclusion the best alternative to the Lumix that also matched my needs was the Sony DSC-H20 though knowing that the lack of a true wide screen (38mm vs 28mm in the panasonic) may limit my landscape shots and group photos.The initial impression once i received the unit was that it was definitely not as slim as the Lumix cameras, and the build quality while good for a plastic unit seemingly a bit fragile compared to the all metal lumix.  I guess its going to take some time for me to shift from the lumix mindset :) The positive being that this sony model was made in Japan.However the pictures confirmed what the reviewers said that it was camera with good potential. The daylight pictures are superb, and the focus is much faster than the TZ4 i had last.  The macro mode is able to go much closer than the TZ4 (and even the TZ7), and i realized this meant even better close up pictures. The video quality in good light is superb, and the zoom speed is decent, and smooth.  The jump to 720p HD is definitely noticed compared to VGA/WVGA and you will not want to revert back :) The Sony focussed quite well while zooming in video mode compared to the TZ4 (and i heard the new TZ7 panasonics also still have this problem).Then i tried the indoor pictures, and the quality again was very good (My wife said the pictures were definitely a lot more clear and vivid compared to the TZ4).  The dual shot capability is also useful, though in most cases the second option is useless as the modes used don't seem very intelligent. The flash definitely is very powerful, and works well even to provide background clarity. The video indoors is much better than my TZ4 as it adapts well to the low light, and in high sensitivity mode while the video can be a bit noisy it still able to provide fair footage.If you are the forgetful type remember to set the flash to auto, if not you are are going to be disappointed when the shots turns out grainy when taken without the flash.The menus are fairly easy to use the feedback from the navigation buttons are bit less than the TZ4, and i miss the context menu capability of the lumix.  Sony hiding the settings menu and requiring the user to press \".\" at the last menu option is unnecessary initially then i realized its to keep the menu's slimmer with the options required for normal use available, and only the lesser used options are in this hidden menu.One feature that i thought the camera had was that it could increase its optical zoom to higher values just like the Panasonic range (e.g. in the lumix when i set it to 3MP, the zoom increased to 15.9X from 10X optical).  However seems the Sony cannot do that, and only has the digital zoom increasing and this is of no use.Another useful feature is that you can press the play button when the camera is switched off to view the photos on the camera without having the lens come out.  The play button also works when you connect the USB connector to connect to the PC again without the lens mechanism getting activated.PROSGood picture quality both outdoors and indoorsVideo is very good, and does well in low light as wellVery good macro photos10X optical zoom an asset for an all purpose cameraNice features and smile shutter works well (yet to try blink detection)Fast focusing specially in low light conditionsLightweight and well balancedNice 3\" LCD which shows pictures wellManual mode useful for indoor and night photosCONSLens cover is a pain, and would have preferred an automatic option like in the lumix, this also makes the camera a bit more bulkyNot a true wide screen optics, so you have a limited view in wide modeOnly 3 modes for video VGA (4:3), and high/low HD (16:9).Use of memory stick as the storage medium :(A slimmer profile would have been nicePop-up flash while effective also mean you need to pop-it in backFlash recycle time is slowManual mode has limited flexibility[Update]Sold the camera the shutter lag and long flash recycling did not suite my type of photography sadly.", "Date": "August 16, 2009"}, {"Title": "Completely Impressed!", "Author": "A.

Tons of neat settings to catch the perfect shot. The macro and close up capability is in amazing detail - as well as the zoom.We took pictures at the zoo of Elephants super far away and zoomed in and got some amazing shots!This camera is positively one of the best I've ever seen Sony put out for it's type. The smile detection function is AWESOME and it REALLY works and it works fast!Also - you can edit peoples faces ON the camera to make it look like they were smiling! How cool is that?Another thing - you can set priority face recognition so that it will focus on the person you want it to when you're shooting pictures - like the bride in a wedding party for example. You can set her face as a priority face and it will automatically focus on her.We are in love with this camera and have absolutely NOTHING but good things to say about it!Buy with confidence knowing you will love this camera.", "Date": "May 27, 2009"}, {"Title": "Best camera for its price!!", "Author": "Michael Pellegrino", "ReviewID": "R3L7PH1MKGW99X", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Hello all, this camera is the real deal for its price.

This is one of the few cameras that allow you to do OPTICAL zoom on the video (canon only do digital zoom while in video mode). The zoom is 38mm to 380mm (10X). Not that good for wide angle (38mm vs 24mm or 28mm in most P&S;), but I prefer to have more zoom (380mm) than wide angle for short distance pics. Also the video format is MPEG4 which I believe is easy to manage and good in compression. Price is also perfect, got it for $230.

By the time i got the camera, I tested it immediately and had a couple of shots. This is my first personal camera and I am really enjoying it a lot. We had a lot of cameras before but my dad/mom owns it and most of them were Sony and I'm just borrowing. This is one of the best Sony's P&S; camera in my opinion.At first, I was planning to get a DSLR or just the DSC-H50 but I am not feeling the bulky cameras as of the moment. I travel a lot and I don't think I want to bring those bulky and heavy gadgets with me. So, I did some research for a good camera specifications (that are small enough) and I ended up choosing between the Canon SD960 and this one (DSC-H20). Both of them almost have the same specs but the Canon camera is a little bit more expensive than H20. Also, I'm looking for a camera with better optical zoom and Sony-H20 offers twice the zoom strength as the Canon model that I am aiming for.What I like about it:- The HD quality video that it can take PLUS you can zoom while recording.- It's like a mini-dslr because you can switch it to Manual mode and you can adjust the aperture and shutter speed so you can do panning as well. A small camera that really works.. what can I say?- I love doing Bokeh and Macro shots!!! A+++- The features such as SCN, editing in camera etc.- The built and grip! Eventhough the body is made out of plastic, you can feel that it's tough and you can hold it really tight.- The smile shutter - works well for the Kids..- Ofcourse, the optical zoom.- The strong flashWhat I don't like:- No viewfinder- Popping out of flash, if you're not aware/forgot that you're going take a shot with a flash on/auto.- Lens cap - you tend to forget that it's there and may block the lens from popping out when you open your camera. It's a little bit annoying and it gives me the feeling that it might break my camera. Though it says that you should remove the cap and turn off your unit and turn it on again, before it works.Well, overall it's a great small camera and very worthit for its price. The cons I listed are not pretty much of a big deal especially when you see the crisp brilliant photos that you can take with DSC-H20. I bet you're going to love it too and it's worthit worthit and worthit!I bought the camera with the following stuffs: Sony 8gb mark 2 pro duo memory card, the sony pouch and a tripod.[...]", "Date": "June 23, 2009"}, {"Title": "when the SLR is not practical", "Author": "bykfixer \"bykfixer\"", "ReviewID": "R1BAQ6BCG4PYXA", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "With this camera you get something pretty close to what the SLR can produce without taking up all that much room or breaking the bank. The 10x zoom is nice and steady with shutter speeds of about 1/25th giving me nice results at 5x7. VR was invented for people like me who quiver. 8x10's are decent as long as the viewer is 3' back or so but that's pretty much a normal veiwing point anyway. The Zeiss lens is phenominal!Bad news first: Noise becomes a factor at about 400 on large prints but anyone who wants to create a scrap book or photo album should not be dissapointed.Some of the layout like formating your memory card could be a drag for some. I have another Sony using #100 file on my computer and when I eventually found the \"re-format\" feature in the menu, it restarted back at 100 instead of #103 I use for this one. ( A Sony issue in general it seems).  I would have preferred an optical veiwfinder but no cameras of this caliber have one these days. Also it would be nice to hold the \"view\" button when pushing the \"on\" button and not have the lens come out to extend battery life a bit. It has a \"manual\" feature but no \"apperature\" or \"shutter\" feature and the \"program\" feature says its adjustable but isn't unless you count the computer doing it for you as such. Point and shoot cameras all come with certain automatic features. Those who require total control must pick their poison and I chose this one for the price versus the overall features.Good news: Start up time is pretty fast. Not SLR like mind you but still pretty good. And if you tap the shutter button (like an SLR) after snapping a photo you can get another photo off pretty quick too. My favorite part about this little gem besides the wonderful pictures it takes are the re-touch features I've not seen on other cameras (yet) like partial color, fisheye and my favorite... retro. I just got the camera and figure on putting it through the paces over time. After 5 days I've shot over 500 pictures. I had to charge the factory battery after about 250 pictures. It came fully charged from the factory so I was taking pictures right out of the box. That was frequently turning it on and off, zooming frequently, retouching numerous photos and using the flash from time to time.Overall I'm pretty satisfied with Sony's little DSC-H20 and would reccomend it to others. At less than $300 it's a keeper. I haven't left home without it yet (even when I have my SLR).edit: the fact that the camera can go from feathers on a bird from 25 yards(10x) to a bug on your sleeve (1/2\" away) without pushing any buttons is amazing. One more thing, I figured out you can push the \"view \" button and the  camera turns on to display photos without the lens popping out in a  touch of a single button instead of a combo like the others.. nice touch Sony", "Date": "August 12, 2009"}, {"Title": "Great so far", "Author": "D.

Believe me, it's gets quite annoying at time - I've lost entire afternoons... Anyway, after researching my next digital camera for a July 4th trip to Gettysburg with the cub scouts and a trip to Alaska the following week, I narrowed it down to 3 different cameras. This particular camera (DSC-H20) was not reviewed by many of the more popular review sites due to it being so new. Because of the success I had with my Sony DSC-S85 in the past and the great price, I decided to give it a try. Well, I haven't gotten to Alaska yet, but I did get to Gettysburg and let me just say that I love this camera! It was so easy to just pick up and run with and use right out of the box (don't forget to buy memory - Mark2). The pictures and the one high def movie I took are INCREDIBLE! I owned a 7.1 mp Olympus between these 2 cameras and the quality of the H20 shatters that of the Olympus. I don't have to retouch a single photo - I'm awfully picky when it comes to my pictures!", "Date": "July 6, 2009"}, {"Title": "Like it better than I did at first", "Author": "M. Stone", "ReviewID": "R11YSVG83IWN22", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "My first digital camera was a Sony DSC-S75 which I still use and it takes great photos. I also own a DSC-V1 which I like for its movie clips that play right away in Windows Media Player. I loved those cameras so much I was sure I would like this one just as well, but so far I'm not sure.On the plus side, it starts up fast and takes great close up photos in macro mode. It does well with outdoor daylight or landscape photos, and the color is very accurate. I like the rounded grip on the right side and the thumb grip on the back, which makes it easy to hold, unlike the little compact cameras that feel like they might fall out of your hand.Night shots have a LOT of noise or graininess, which was disappointing. When zoomed in at 100% on the computer you can see this. The photos would probably be okay for small prints or viewing the images in a smaller size on the computer, but I doubt that larger prints would turn out well.  (I shot these at the 8M size in 3:2 aspect ratio).I took some outdoor night shots of various lighted buildings, a steamboat, etc. that were lit up for Christmas and there were lights reflecting on a river.  I took other night shots with lit buildings. The good thing was that the camera actually made the photos appear brighter than the scene actually looked in real life, but there was still a lot of \"noise\" in the dark areas.I don't really like that this camera films its movies in MPEG4, which is not compatible with Windows Media Player.  Before I bought it, I thought that MPEG4 was compatible, but it's not.  I also don't like that Sony has reduced the size of their memory sticks. Now if you want to use a card reader that's already in your computer, you have to find an adaptor to place the smaller memory stick in, then put the adaptor in your computer. Luckily I was able to find one at K-Mart, but good luck finding a genuine non-imitation Sony memory stick adaptor on the Internet, it's like finding a needle in a haystack. You can always hook up the camera using the USB cable, but that sort of defeats the purpose of having a card reader in your computer!UPDATE: Dec. 25, 2009 - After using this camera more, I'm starting to like it better. After comparing it with the Canon SD1200, this Sony does better with lighting and video quality. The Canon often has a hard time capturing accurate reds in certain situations. Also, the Canon does not do as well in dark lighting when it comes to making the setting brighter. I have taken many photos of Christmas lights at night with both cameras, and while the Sony still has more noise in darker areas, it has done much better at capturing the warmth and brightness of the lights. It makes dark scenes lighter and brighter, which looks nice.Also, I downloaded the VLC video player from Videolan and it works to play the MPEG4 clips. Microsoft's website says MPEG4 will not play in Media Player (unless you convert them), I've tried and it won't work. (I have version 10.) BTW, the MPEG4 video clips from the Sony are also better quality than the AVI files from the Canon. You can also use the zoom lens in the Sony while filming video and it does not degrade the quality of the video. Whereas with my Canon SD1200, it only has a 3X zoom and you can't even use the whole zoom in video mode without it getting blurry. (I know these 2 cameras aren't exactly in the same category or \"class\", but that's what I have right now so that's what I'm comparing it with.)Sony cameras are also more user friendly when downloading files onto a computer. I've had problems importing video files from my Canon; there are always a few video clips that show 0 file size and won't play until I re-import them using the Microsoft Camera Wizard, which is a big pain. I've never had that problem with a Sony camera.UPDATE AGAIN:  Dec. 31, 2009. I've been researching noise and high megapixel count. I learned that higher megapixels in a smaller camera with a smaller sensor means more noise, because each pixel is smaller and less light reaches each pixel. After testing and using some of the new model cameras with 10 or 12 megapixels, there is just no escaping this noise issue. This Sony H20 camera still does very well with lighting, focus, and color accuracy, but I have even found that shots of people in regular indoor lighting still have lots of noise and fuzziness when viewed at 100% in Photoshop. They look okay in 4x6 size prints, but I doubt that larger ones would look good.If you read the specs at dpreview, note that the expensive SLR cameras have larger sensors with LESS pixel density, whereas most of the small cameras with 10-12 megapixels crammed in have MORE pixel density, which translates to more noise on the image.  Camera manufacturers must know this, and I don't know why they continue to make small cameras this way.  Higher MP count in small cameras only makes image quality worse, not better.From my experience, the best older camera for pure photo quality is the Sony DSC-V1. Its little batteries don't hold a charge for very long, and videos are a little jerky, but nothing I have found so far beats it for sharp, clear image quality with little to no noise. It only has 5 megapixels, but 5 or 6 is all most people really need for good quality prints, anyway.

This was a very difficult decision for me as each of these cameras has strong points and weak points and none of them are perfect.  My favorite sites for doing this research, btw, are dpreview, imaging-resource, cameralabs and photographyblog.So, why did I pick this camera over the other two I looked at?  Let me answer those one at a time:(1) SX200 - this one was very tempting to me.  I really liked the range on the lens (12x, starting at 28mm vs 38mm 10x for the H20) and I also liked how it looked, especially the red one.  My last camera was a Canon A80, so this was a very natural upgrade for me to consider.  I liked, for example, all the manual control with this camera (it has shutter and aperture priority, which my H20 does not (but it does have a manual mode where you can set these manually). But, this camera had three issues that worried me:  (1) I saw way too many references to lens errors with this camera (check the 1 star reviews and google it), (2) the camera cannot zoom optically while taking movies and (3) when I compared the pictures side-by-side to the H20 (which a couple of the sites I mentioned let you do) the H20 pictures were crisper and sharper and had more detail, which I like.  Based on what I read, the MP4 HD movie format of my H20 should be more compact and easier to work with than the MOV format of the Canon.(2) ZS3 - okay, this one looks like a nice camera. It has stereo sound in movies and it also has optical zoom, like the H20.  Another nice thing about the ZS3 is that the lens zooms more quietly then my H20 - you can hear the lens motor moving the lens in and out on the H20 and I did not notice that in ZS3 movies I listened to on Youtube.  In the end, the ZS3 is really a straight point and shoot, however, and it does not have much in the way of manual controls (I would put the H20 in between the Canon and the ZS3 in this regard) and I really like to fool around with settings, so for me this was a negative.  Other than that though, the ZS3 looked like a good camera (It also has a nice range lens, 25-300mm).  I did get the impression in reviews that maybe my H20 took better straight photos then this one, although I would give the ZS3 the nod when it comes to HD movie capability.What do I like about the H20?* Solid construction, does not feel fragile* Takes excellent, sharp, clear photos with good, natural color* Good intelligent auto mode - has a feature here where it will take an extra photo with slightly tweaked settings so you can choose the best one to keep* Takes very good HD movies with optical zoom (but mono sound)* Allows me to play with settings (manual mode, etc)* Fast - check reviews for FPS (e.g. CNET), it is a fast camera compared to others (such as the Canon)* Good flash, can be adjusted* Nice, clear LCD (but can be a bit difficult to see in bright sun)* This camera has excellent image stabilization (check that at cameralabs)What don't I like?* I wish it had a wider angle lens at the low end like the other two cameras I looked at* The optical zoom makes a noise when I use it while taking movies* It does not have an HDMI port on it, so you have to get one of these Sony VMC-MHC2 DSC HD Accessory Audio Video and USB Cable (Black) to connect it to your HD TV* I would have preferred AA batteries, although some reviews claim that cameras are slower because of those* 10x zoom is good, but 20x is better!* Low light movies indoors are grainyBesides the cable I linked, I got this case for it: Sony LCS-CSD General Carrying Case for Compatible Cybershot Digital Cameras and this screen protector/battery combo: eForcity Reusable Screen Protector + NP-BG1 Li-Ion Battery for Sony DSC-H20.  The case fits it very well and has room for the extra battery.  The battery works fine as well and seems to have equivalent life to the OEM battery (I can use the charger that came with the camera to charge it).All in all, I am happy with the camera.  I have had no problems with it and, within the limitations of its lens (no wide angle), it takes excellent photos and movies.", "Date": "February 13, 2010"}, {"Title": "Good photo quality but some flaws", "Author": "Brownsfan 24", "ReviewID": "R15CIRD0T3HXUA", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "I did my homework on the zoom point and shoot camera class after having to return a Nikon L-100.  The Nikon took blurry dark pictures in almost every light condition except bright sun, and it used up AA batteries at an alarming rate.  After checking all of the review sites I could find, I settled on the DSC-H20, had the best overall reviews for ease of use and picure quality combined.  I like C-NET for electronic reviews and have found their reviews to be un-biased and accurate with knowledegeable experts giving te reviews.They were right about the point and shoot picture quality of this camera.  The first photos I took of some items to auction on ebay came out very good in inteligent auto mode in a brightly lit room, and I was very happy initally.I had to use the 7 year old Dell photo software that was on my computer because I could not figure out the Sony PMB photo software that came with the camera.  The PMB software CD that came with the DSC-H20 also installed four different programs on my computer.  The PMB software is NOT user friendly and I have given up trying to use it.  I read the camera owners manual and the sofware manual entirely, still confused on how to edit, process, and file photos.  Now to the menus on the camera: you have to keep the owners manual nearby constantly to remember which mode you need to be in to find the right adjustment item.  If you are the type that uses your camera every day, you can probably start to remember where everything is.  If you are like me and use the camera maybe three times/month, good luck trying to adjust any settings.Now to the two major flaws that feel C-Net and other reviewers are missing.  The Cybershot DSC-H20 is not only lacking a wide angle lens like most of the competition, but this camera has an extremely NARROW ANGLE LENS.  It is similar to my 20 year old 35mm.  No group photos or lanscape shots with this camera.The other major flaw is no viewfinder, which would be ok if you could actually see the screen in bright outdoor light.  Most digital point and shoots have no viewfinder, but the glare off of the screen on the DSC-H20 makes any outdoor photo a challenge.", "Date": "January 31, 2010"}, {"Title": "Would like a view finder and auto lens cover but otherwise, great", "Author": "Mom to Alysse and Robin", "ReviewID": "RXVTV0RC89PCT", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I misplaced my Sony DSC-P200 that I loved and assuming I would eventually find it (I did), I wanted something different to take on vacation.

The only things I don't like are the lack of a view finder and the plastic lens cap that has to be manually removed. It is almost impossible to find a 10X digital camera with a view finder and although they said it was easy to see the screen on this camera in the sun, it is not. If you forget to take off the lens cap, the camera stalls out and you have to turn it off and then turn it on again - meanwhile, missing your shot. I had no idea that Sony would make a digital camera without an automatic lens cover.I thought that I would not like the charger. With the P200, I just plug it in and don't have to take the battery out and wanted that again. I was wrong. It is quick and easy to take the battery out and charge it and the charger is nice and small for travel. I would definitely choose this system again.I used this camera on a recent trip to California and took pictures in Monterey Bay Aquarium, at the beach, and in Sequoia and Yosemite National Parks. I took pictures and videos of animals in aquariums, seals on the rocks below us at Pt. Lobos, kids doing cartwheels on the beach, close-ups and distant shots of vegetation, etc and most pictures turned out wonderfully. My sister was frequently taking similar pictures on her Panasonic Lumix 10X and for the most part, my pictures were noticeably better. I can actually see the parts of the jellyfish that look like moving neon lights in both the still shots and videos. She cannot.

It is so hard to make an informed decision with so many reviews out there!  It is overwhelming!Back story.....my husband and I have owned two digital cameras so far.  A Kodak Easyshare, one of the first ones when they came out.  My mother got it for our wedding, it was over $500 bucks.  It two years, the thing totally died on us.  Got screwed over by Best Buy.  They sent the camera away to \"fix\" it, when it came back in, they S O L D it!  So we obviously got them to replace a new camera, for the total of what we originally paid for the Kodak and got a Canon PowerShot A620 (which was four years ago)  That camera has been through two births of our kiddos, lots of holidays, celebrations, etc, etc.  I have never LOVED the camera, but it took an ok shot for what a mommy would need.So, we decided it was time to get another.  The Canon was starting to take really blurry pics, the lens was making funny noises when it would turn on and off.  The husband wanted a really small camera we could throw in our pockets when we go to DIsney.  I wanted one that would take excellent pictures.  We ended up deciding on the Canon SD780.  Small, 12mp, etc........he was in love with the idea of it.I bought it Black Friday (11/27/09) and returned it 4 days later.  We took it to a wedding over the weekend, and the pictures were of such poor quality, I could have taken better with our 2mp camera phone.  It was just such a big disappointment.After a lot more research, and many trips to try the cameras out in the stores, I decided to try the Sony Cyber Shot DSC H20.  I saw some pictures on here by another reviewer and they looked amazing.  Better then my brothers Nikon D60.I love the features on this camera, it is easy to use and fun to use.  The pictures are of amazing quality, even in the lower MP settings.  I was taking some ipctures in 3MP and didn't even realize it, still just beautiful.  The zoom is amazing.  It is so clear compared to my Canon.  I could never zoom with that thing, it was always blurry.  This one though I can zoom in a very low light room, and it is just so clear.My husband is not SO happy with the size, but I told him to just deal.  The picture quality is so worth it!  He also was not sure about having a removable lens cover, but I like it.  Our Canon one was dying, this one CAN'T!  The LCD display is just awesome.  I just can't say enough about this camera.In closing, if you are looking for a camera around 250, GET THIS ONE!  Hands down.

I don't like buying electronic stuff through internet, just a security option for me. I did bought here in Amazon a 2 GB MS card and a bag for my camera. I like them both, as well as I love the camera. I haven't got many opportunities to test it fully, but I can say this camera does more than even Sony says in their product page.For a start, its possible to add an adaptor ring to use a Teleconversion lens, a Close-Up lens, a Wide-Conversion lens, and every 58 mm filter (UV, Polarizer, Fluorescent, ND, etc.) you can find in the market. If you do a little research in Sony online shop, you can discover all this, but they seem to lack some information (like the camera compability with these accessories). I have searched in the main accessory section for digital cameras, then the H series, and then, Lenses. What do they show up? Nothing. However, in my camera box, there is a picture illustrating how easy it is to add the adaptor (Sony VAD-HA Lens Adaptor Ring for DSC-H20) and connected to this ring, one of the following lenses:- Sony VCL-DH1758 Tele Conversion Lens for DSCH1 Digital Camera- Sony VCL-M3358 58mm Close Up Lens for the DCR-VX2100- Sony VCL-DH0758 Wide Angle Conversion Lens for DSCH1, H2 and H5 Digital CamerasMore detailed information and other accessories-related stuff comes in a flyer that ships with inside the camera box.Apart from this lack of information from Sony, the camera works great and does what it is supposed to do. Yesterday night, with the help of a photography book manual, I was able to get my camera to take a 30 seconds shoot just close to the window, pointing straigh-forward, and capture a nice training picture of an urban theme. I didn't know the camera could do that, as well as a 1/2000 second shoot, on the other hand. You can control a lot of other details, like ISO value between 80 and 3200, the flash level (when used), 10x zoom (but that anyone already knows by now), and the capability to slowly zoom in and out while taking a HD movie, with sound.My rating for this camera is a 5 star because I love all the things it has. If someone asks me about rating the manufacturer, Sony, I would say a 4. They lack essential information in their site, as I stated before.For a digital camera, its excelent at what it does.

I was a little leery of the fact that it was only 10.1 megapixels, but after some research, I realized that, unless you plan to blow up your photos to larger than 14\" by 11\" or something, you're still getting resolution that is as good as 35mm (with the ease of a point and shoot).  The pictures look fabulous (and that's on a 22\" HD monitor) and the camera is very easy to use, but the most suprisingly pleasing feature is the video quality.  It shoots video in 720P and the sound is actually quite good for a little camera.  The most exciting thing to us is that we have been able to take it to a number of concerts this summer where video cameras would not have been allowed but where small non-professional cameras are welcome and have come away with some very high quality video souvenirs.  I'm not talking 1 minute clips, I'm talking song after song after song with very good sound and GREAT video.  We won't even burn it to DVD because we don't want the resolution to jump down to 480 from 720...looks like we'll need a blu ray burner soon!One thing about the video, when we played it back, the audio was a few seconds ahead of the video. It was an easy fix though because we downloaded a free program to play it through that put the audio in sync with the video.  PERFECTION!I saw a couple looking at the camera in best buy and I had to stop and tell them that it is practically a must-have.  I think they bought it actually.You will want a 4 or 8 GB memory stick if you plan to do a lot of video.  We did about 40-45 minutes on a 4 gig and we still had extra room, but for a kid's play or a concert or something, it would probably be nice to have an 8 gig just for the peace of mind.  It would also be handy to have an extra battery because we have had the low battery light come on, but only after LOTS of pictures and video (we don't have one and have been fine, but we may get one).One more thing...the small cybershot case that many people have bought with this is NOT big enough for this model, it is for the smaller cybershots that don't have the powerful optical zoom.  Ours is sitting empty in our house, but the camera fits easily in a purse or coat pocket so we haven't bothered to replace it yet.I cannot reccommend this camera strongly enough.

And most of them have very bright (unrealistic) lighting for testing, since I noticed my last camera is at its worst when not in bright light (focus dances in and out trying to decide).I wasn't familiar with Sony, so the controls are 'different'.  But I'll get used to them.Good: - fast shots, very little shutter lag - I like the ISO scene mode; low light photos with no flash.  Previously I did this manually; and you can set the ISO yourself in other modes - Battery charger simple (Nikon had cords; harder to setup). - 10x optical zoom works great.  Note setting to turn off digital zoom. - pop up flash, should separate more from the lens and reduce red eye. - smaller than Canon SX120si (other one I was considering).  Also, it has Lithium batteries (the Canon has AA).Bad: - I don't see a panorama mode for stitching together photos into one large one. - It has a physical lens cap, not a built in shutter covering.  I'll probably get used to that, I had an SLR years ago. - Sony proprietary memory.  I'm told other kinds are cheaper, and some have wireless built into them to do file transfers (Sony doesn't). - lens is not \"fast\", 3.5 I think, so low light isn't great.

The choices came down to the Panasonic ZS3 and the Sony CyberShot DSC-H20. Hands on is the only real way of determining which is best for a person, so I bought both to do a direct comparison. After a week of comparing these two cameras in daylight, low light, night shots, and video here is MY conclusion (individual mileage may vary...):I'm keeping the Sony H20; it has to be one of the most underated cameras being sold today. I'll summarize at the end of this review why it is so much better for me than the Panasonic. But now for some specifics about the Sony H20.Pros:Great screenOptical zoom while video recordingGreat low light capabilitiesStrong flashManual controlsExcellent IA modeHigh quality videoCons:Lens capOverall size and shape compared to Panasonic ZS3Cost of memory stick pro duo compared to SD/micro SD storageLack of true wide-angle lens (see below how this not a con for me)The Panasonic ZS3 was not a bad camera (It was better in some ways...video primarily, than the Canon SX200is), but it's picture quality is not up to some of the Canon and Sony models I've used. The biggest problem for me however, was the dismal low light capabilities. I'm not trying to shoot in the dark, but I'm also not always in a small room and close to the subjects where the flash MIGHT work. I like to use the camera at concerts and in cities using the ambient street/sign lighting.The Sony H20 on the other hand has EXCELLENT low light and night shot capabilities! Also the video is just as high quality, you can optically zoom during video recording, and the focus seems quicker during zooming. You have an abundance of manual controls in addition to an IA mode that seems just as smart as the Panasonic ZS3. And the final point in favor of the Sony is the image quality comparing identical pictures taken under the same lighting, time, zoom, etc. conditions was much better with the Sony, especially at the 5-10X zoom level. The noise level was much less even at ISO 800 with the Sony.The cons for the Sony would be the lens cap, slightly larger camera \"thickness\", and the \"not so wide-angle lens\". However for me, the wide-angle lens issue did not bother me as I rarely take any type of group pictures needing a super wide-angle lens. Remember, that's how I use a camera; this may not work for you, but don't count out the Sony because of that.Control responsiveness and shot to shot speed was similar in both cameras. Both cameras have excellent build quality. Battery life was similar...around 250 pictures with 30% of that using the flash and 30 minutes worth of video.Hope this has been helpful and at least gives you some things to consider about you camera needs.", "Date": "August 8, 2009"}, {"Title": "Good camera", "Author": "Alvin Morales", "ReviewID": "RR982PX0GGEAZ", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I was originally going to give to give this camera 3 stars, but, considering I paid just under $200 with some Rewards Zone coupons and sale price at Best Buy, I decided to give it one extra star.  Don't get me wrong it's a very nice camera.  The build quality is very good; almost like a mini SLR.  I love that it includes a cap to keep your lens protected when not in use.  Be careful however when playing back your pictures.  I found that when viewing pictures with the camera turned off, you had to hit the \"on/off\" button to shut it off, as opposed to just hitting the \"play\" button again.  Otherwise the camera turns on and if you have your cap on, you risk damaging the lens motor.  My other camera is a Canon SD990is which can be turned off by hitting the \"play\" button.  It makes complete sense, but I think the Canon is more convenient in this area.  Well, it's tough to compare the two considering that the Canon costs considerably more, but there are some areas in which I wish the Sony performed better.  Mainly in low light.  Pictures regardless of which of the many picture settings I used were noticeably grainy.  This is very disappointing since I tend to take many pictures at night and prefer to avoid using the flash when possible.  Even with it on however the Sony just cannot keep up with the Canon.  Again, it's way more money, but if you're looking for a camera with good low light performance, consider looking elsewhere.  On a more positive note, this camera has something the Canon doesn't; and that is an adjustable flash.  This is a great feature which I found helped me fine tune indoors pictures.  Sometimes flashes tend to be too strong and wash out subjects, but in this case you have the option of regulating the output.  Very useful indeed.  Additionally, the auto macro mode is super awesome on the Sony.  In the Canon you have to select it.  The \"intelligent\" mode works well enough, though I tend to leave it in \"P\" mode.  I also did some filming at a baseball game and found the quality of movies to be very good.  I love the 10x optical zoom.  This was a huge selling point for me as digital zooms are pointless since they deteriorate quality significantly.  Daytime pictures on the other hand are very good with natural colors.  The camera had trouble focusing occasionally, but this was rare.  I noticed that at the baseball game mentioned earlier the white lines in certain areas looked jagged.  I thought this might have been a result of my using the full zoom, but I found that in other pictures with no zoom the jaggedness was also visible.  Very rare, but nonetheless noticeable in certain pictures.  Very random.  In conclusion my review is only meant to point out flaws that might be important to other consumers, but it's certainly not meant to bash the camera.

As someone who is somewhat of an archivist, who likes to capture life as it happens in both still photography and video-land, I always seem to be acquiring different cameras for different needs, selling some and buying new others to replace them. And every now and then a camera comes along that seems to hop to both the forefront of where technology is at the moment, and seems to imbue all of the needs that I have for a camera of its class perfectly.For a long time, I carried around the Casio Exilim EX-Z750 everywhere-- the fact was that it was really small, able to get really good quality video just about anywhere, and took really good quality pictures with no hesitation with many user-friendly (read: dummyproof) modes. Then it began to be the age of accessible HD video, and thus my quest then had to move forward.First thing I tried was the Canon Powershot SD-780IS. And that is a sleek, nice cam, very capable for its size. But many of the stills came out blurry and some of the vid was a bit grainy, and well, it just wasn't the perfect find really.Eventually after watching a lot of YouTube sample videos and whatnot, I luckily happened upon this cam. Not only was it a direct descendant of the cybershot H1 I already own, able to get great zoom shots with a big nice lens and well-done anti-shake technology, but HD video at a really decent conversion rate, one that could get about a half hour with a 2-gigger card? Nice!When I got it I was impressed with the big sleek screen, but I have to say I was a good bit worried when I started posturing with it and taking shots. On the screen itself, the views looked pixellated and sub-par. In my brain I was already thinking, ugh, this one may not exactly be a keeper. But thereafter, when I actually flew the stuff down to computer, I stood there completely changed. Beautiful, clear shots, brilliant color, just the right amount of saturation, the whole nine yards. The functionality is great, everything's easy to find like the self-timer and all of that, and the zoom is super-nice.The video itself is quite pristine-- The only thing I have that gets better video is a 3-chip Panasonic HDC-SD9 and well, that's really stepping into a different class from any point and shoot kind of device.Anyway, the point is that I feel as though I have found my 'answer-all' camera for the current timeframe, to hold that 'ok, you're going somewhere quick, you can only grab 1 camera, which is it?' kind of space.

I took several flash photos of my kids indoors and they looked great. I was anxious to see the results from the 720p movie mode and to my surprise the mp4 movies far surpassed what I expected from a digicam. There was no comparison, the videos were way better than any of the digital cameras I have used. Outdoor movie recordings in 720p mode, the recordings look awesome on my 42\" Panasonic plasma HDTV. Indoor movie mode looked great but in low light things get a little grainy but far better than I expected. Unlike most cameras you can also use the zoom while you are recording in movie mode. I love the 10x zoom, the image stabilization is done right on this camera, even with my shaky hands the photos come out perfectly focused, bright and clear at full 10x.

I am now looking to replace this camera after only one year.  One pro:  Pic quality and Battery life is great!)I was looking to replace my older 3MB Sony Cybershot which served me faithfully for years with no problems.  I narrowed my selection down to cameras with 10X optical zoom or higher.  I checked the Canon, Sony and Panasonic.  All were reviewed well.  I was on the verge of buying the Panasonic Lumix 12x Optical when this H20 camera went on sale at Office Depot for $229 so I bought it.I like it and have taken hundreds of shots with it.  Most likely you are interested in the negatives I've found so here they are:  Camera lens not builtin so you must manually remove/replace the lens cap (irritates more than I thought it would), camera is SLOW in low-light and takes several seconds to take the shot (caused me to miss shots), video can be a bit choppy, just barely fits in my pocket and proprietary cable for pc/tv (not really bad but you cant use someone elses USB cable).Keep in mind I only used the AUTO mode so far...Now the good things I found:  Pictures are beautiful, zoom works smoothly in and out, menu is easy to use, automatically takes two shots when not sure of exposure and one of them is usually very good, nice hand grip, battery life good and easy to charge (bought cheap backup on eBay), easy playback with PLAY button on back of camera, fast to boot up (if cap is off), flash is bright and LCD is bright and easy to see.One other thing, this camera feels solid...not cheap.You may wonder why I originally chose Panasonic.  It was the size, AVCHD video mode and the 12X optical.  I hava used Canon and love the quality of the Canon pics but there were a few features that were lacking which I can't remember at this time.I suspect the next round of hi-zoom, HD video cameras will be really nice and I can't wait to see the quality of the pics and video.

I currently collect digital cameras, and have about 20 of them.  To me, the newer and better digital cameras of the last 3 or 4 years have more to do with marketing than technology.  I haven't seen anything that even comes close to the Sony H20.  Some people have caught on to this remarkable camera; and the few new ones still available cost more now than they did when they were first sold.Suffering growing pains, much like automobiles did at the early 20th century, the problem with many digital cameras is form over function.  The form of many digital cameras look like the old 35mm single lens reflexes. (The first automobiles looked like horse drawn buggies.) That's because the marketers make novice users more comfortable if the digital looks like a familiar older film camera.  It's marketing, and it's rubbish.  The beauty in the H20 is that the form follows the function and provides excellent pictures of great value in a compact and functional size, no boat anchor here.The pictures from an H20 are stunning when compared with those taken by lesser cameras. Also, the stabilized lens elements allow people with shaky hands to get good pictures; and also it's possible to hand hold telephoto pictures that required a tripod with the telephoto pictures of the past. The H20 telephoto pictures from its 10 to 1 zoom lens are better than any 35mm telephoto pictures I've ever taken and I used 35mm cameras for over 50 years.  To exceed the H20 with film would take extreme professional equipment costing thousands.But, having said all this, there is a certain undefined quality to the H20 that people recognize; and whether they take MP4 videos, or stills, I don't believe there are any digital cameras better than the H20.", "Date": "October 2, 2011"}, {"Title": "Sony - overall a great choice for point and shoot, video, and portable!", "Author": "Zoo Keeper", "ReviewID": "R3QR0A4W7EJD1U", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I owned a pink Sony Cybershot with 4x optical zoom and 7.1 MP model DSC W120 camera that took 480 x 640 video.  I was looking for something with more optical zoom and 720 HD video since my camcorder no longer works and was the old-style tape kind.  Tape video was also difficult and time consuming to import into a computer versus digital version.My decision was between this and the Canon SX120 (the most comparable in price) or SX20.I liked that both of the Canons took AA (two or four) batteries and a standard SD card, but the Canon SX120 still had the 480 x 640 video.  So the deciding factor for the Sony over the Canon SX120 was the 720 HD video, being able to record in a more compressed format, and recording for longer periods of time.The Canon SX20's (a larger camera that is more the size of a SLR) only additional real advantage over the SX120 was the 720 HD video and 20x zoom which was important since I am using this as a camcorder right now too, BUT it is about $200 more.  I still will probably get a HD camcorder (1080 instead of 720) someday so I couldn't justify this not to mention this camera wasn't really pocketable for most of the events I would be using a camera for, and it seemed like you could only record for 20 minutes at a time in a less compressed format.Although it's nice that the Canons I looked at use an SD card, you have to get at least a Class 6 (I think or better), and not all SD cards are the same quality even if they are the minimum class.  Though I dislike \"proprietary\" cards, using a Sony memory stick will probably mean the least issues later on with video quality.The included battery pack I had in my old Sony camera is the same one this camera takes, and it lasted for a long time not to mention I'll have an extra for this camera now.  It also seemed like my Nikon camera my daughter has that used AA batteries took longer to recover even though it was comparable to the Sony DSC W120 in other ways.  I do wish Sony would have included the upgraded battery that displayed the time left instead of just a graphic indicator amount of battery left.  I like that a separate battery charger is included so I can charge the extra battery and still use the camera.I am very pleased with the intelligent auto mode plus the manual options as well.  It also captures action and low-light shots much better than my W120 model camera.  It seems to reduce red eye and the glow of pet's eyes much better, and it's easier to fix if there is a problem. 10x will be enough zoom for most pictures.Video is so much clearer than the video my W120 took! It imported well into the latest version of Pinnacle Studio though I would use the video from the original card instead of copying to hard drive if you don't want to use Sony's software to transfer it.  If I just copied it to the hard drive, it seemed like there were some \"bad places\" in the video that don't show up if I used the original video on the Sony card.  It is going to take a lot more computer resources to process the 1080 so this may be a good compromise until I can upgrade my computer including adding a blu-ray burner.  For now, I am downgrading the 720 video to a standard DVD anyway until I can upgrade the computer DVD drive and household DVD player to a blu-ray.  The video is still much clearer than video from the 480 x 640 on a 720 HD TV that is about 42\".Overall, this camera is a great all around camera that is still small enough to be portable, easy to grip, and a value packed for the price!

It is not a full SLR, but it has a great array of options, takes excellent pictures and I would recommend it to anyone who has a little bit of digital camera experience, who is willing to read the manual, or is good at intuitive learning.You will note that on Amazon about 93% of the reviews are 4 or 5 stars....and looking through the less than 5 that are 1 or 2 stars it looks like some folks should RTFM.Most of the complaints are valid, but fixable, \"the intelligent mode takes washed out pictures\", or \"the flash is too bright\"... If you want a fully point and click camera this is probably not for you if you don't read your manual and know a little about how to use a camera. However, if you can read a manual, have a smidge of intuition, or are just willing to experiment a little, and you are cognizant of the restraints of this platform, you will be immensely satisfied with this camera.This is NOT going to be a camera that out of the box will take every picture the same as an SLR camera, but if you use it correctly it will come close. That is what this platform is--a compromise between point and shoots and more complex SLR cameras. You give up some low light quality in some instances, you may have to adjust the light levels at some point, and you may have to reduce the flash sometimes--and if you disable the digital zoom you will avoid any pixelation; you can always blow it up in your photo shopping program.With all of that out of the way,...I love this camera. I have had 5 Cybershots over the years and been extremely pleased with all but one--and that one was not suitable for my needs and I didn't read about it before buying it. It is easy to use, has enough options to handle most situations and takes fabulous photos if you use it correctly in a given situation.

Battery charges fast & holds charge for hours in spite of off/on, zoom, movies, play back, etc. I was really pleased. Never once did I have any problems with the camera. Power up to 1st shot is very quick. Clarity of 3\" LCD screen is incredible. I put one of those screen protectors on since I knew I'd be haulin' it everywhere. That works great as well. I used an 8GB data card and it holds tons of shots & vids. The only thing I was worried about was the lens caps and what a \"hassel\" it would be. But it really wasn't a problem at all. The on/off action of the lens cap becomes an automatic action. When taking movies, remember to move the mode back to pics to avoid delays. I made that mistake a couple of times. Hopefully this helps those who are on the fence. No it's not micro-compact but it's small enough to slip into a jacket pocket, purse, etc. Placement of the data port is odd and the PC cable is bulky but for the quality I don't care.

I contacted Sony and was told to go to the website and follow technical instructions and see if I could reset it.  I was unable to accomplish this so I sent it to their repair facility in Laredo TX.  I was told the camera had \"corroded\" and thus the warranty was voided and that it would cost $600 to repair the camera that I paid approximately $250 for brand new!  I was shocked!! I spoke to three different representatives of Sony (only one of whom spoke understandable English) and in the end I was told there was nothing else they could do to help me.  What a waste of good money on a camera that I expected years of use from!  What poor customer service, how on earth can a $250 camera require $600 worth of parts?!

I switched from Minolta in the film world to Cannon and now shoot the Digital Rebel. I love it, although I still sometimes question my decision for Cannon over Nikkon, but I digress.Last month I decided not to take my camera because of the carry-on issue. Two days into the trip I found myself in an electronics store searching for a compact camera that could still deliver quality. The store was closing out the Sony CyberShot DSCH20 Syber Shot. Sony.I bought it and love most of it. This tiny camera has 10 x optical zoom that works well, captures quality video and is easy to use, even for the very beginner. Though it does have a Manual mode option, most of the shooting options are geared for getting the best pictures with the least amount of fiddling. Program Auto handles shutter speed and aperture, but gives you access to ISO, exposure, white balance, focus, and metering among other things.I found it a camera with a zoom, flash and all I need for vacation/work shooting. While it is way smaller than what I am use to lugging around, it doesn't fit in my pocket like I see other tourists using. Now if you wear a jacket, this is perfect.There are two things worth mentioning that hurt the overall package. One, unlike a majority of the cameras in the compact megazoom category, the lens is protected by a physical cap instead of a mechanical cover. If you forget to remove it before powering up, the camera stalls out and you have to remove the cover and turn the camera off and on again. it is also a bit of a pain to remove.Two, if you frequently find yourself taking pictures of large groups of people in confined spaces, this probably won't be a good fit.Again, this is a point and shoot and isn't for the professional shooter, but is a great inexpensive camera to capture moments worth remembering.", "Date": "May 10, 2010"}, {"Title": "Extremely pleased!", "Author": "A.

The DSC-H20 won in the end, however due to size and portability, as this purchase was intended to give me a good camera for carrying around Japan for two weeks.I haven't been this happy with a digital camera in some time, and as one who was looking for a smaller handheld with decent manual controls, the DSC-H20 is perfect. ISO, exposure time, and aperture are all adjustable for people like myself who don't want to be tethered to preset controls. Even the presets are good, though, providing quite a list of options for people shooting a specific scene. Or for the lazy photographers that just want an easy mode, that's there as well. Sony's Intelligent Auto Mode is excellent also, and provides quality well over the standard easy setting on the camera.Other pluses of the camera are the 10x optical zoom, which is honestly plenty. I spent some time comparing the HX1 to the DSC-H20, and while the 20x zoom on the former was nice, it got pretty blurry and unfocused after zooming out past 14x or so. And 720p video capture doesn't hurt, either. As well, capturing still pictures in 1080p is great, especially for the night time shots  with around a 5 second exposure, really showcases the light and detail on the subject that you're shooting. I also really don't want to forget gushing about how good the macros this thing takes are. Detail is awesome and focus is amazing, and if the light is right can look like works of art. Lastly, the difference between a camera that uses standardized AA's versus this guy, which utilizes a lithium ion is night and day.So clearly I love this camera. I consider it a good induction back into photography, and art that I have enjoyed years past and wanted to get back into for some time. The Sony DSC-H20 is a great camera to get your bearings with, and half the cost of a decent DSLR.

Each time I've upgraded, it's been a Cybershot.

There are little things on this camera that I'm still discovering each day.  For instance, the slide show with music, very cute touch, my 2 year old and 6 year old love to watch.  I love taking pictures and really wanted one that did great low light pictures and this definitely takes great pictures with very little light.The only thing I have been disappointed in with this last version of Cybershot is the time it takes for the first picture.  All other Cybershots have taken very quick first pictures and this has been a change that I'm having a hard time adjusting to.  However, based on the review conducted by Consumer Reports (2009), it was rated good-excellent for first shot timing, so I'm unsure if it's just the cameras of \"today\" take a lit bit more time to set up for the first shot than they used to (larger picture size, perhaps).  Also, it is a bit larger than other Cybershots of past and of what's available today, but it is still fairly compact and I would not use that as a deterrant for buying this camera!All in all, I've been very pleased once again with a Cybershot.

It took great pictures--far better than the newer higher megapixel cameras my friends owned.  Unfortunately I recently \"clanked\" the camera on a rock and damaged the lens beyond repair.  I was excited to purchase a new camera and settled on the Cybershot H2O because of all the positive reviews and my own experience with the older model.  I hoped the few negative reviews that appeared here were a result of a rare factory defect.I have used the camera for 3 weeks now and I am disappointed.  I take mostly scenery pictures of the beautiful North Carolina mountains.  The default color and light intensity settings greatly overexpose the pictures and tend to wash them out.  Fall colors here are outstanding but one wouldn't believe it based upon the pictures.  To compensate I have to underexpose the pictures by 0.7 - 1.0EV and increase the color intensity.  This can be done in several of the camera settings but it is a pain.  The pictures are not sharp.  The normally sharp horizon of the mountains appears blurred in the pictures--as if the camera has 20/60 vision.  No mode on the camera solves this problem.The camera has a 10X optical zoom.  However, the pictures are not sharp.  The camera appears to be \"confused\" as how to focus the image.The \"Easy\" setting is useless for scenery shots because it has no manual override.  Therefore, the pictures are over exposed and under saturated in color.The flash button does not turn on the flash.  One has to manually force the flash on from an on-screen menu.  This is difficult to see on a bright day when the subject is backlight.  The default flash intensity is too high for indoor photos of human subjects.  They get washed out.  I have to manually reduce the flash intensity from the default setting.The least movement by ones subject creates a blurred image in not very low light conditions such as shade.  This was extremely disappoinging when taking pictures of my grandson who was playing in the raked leaves.  To capture him I would probably have had to switch the camera to the \"Manual\" setting.  Rather cumbersome.  You can't retake an action photo. He won't play in the leaves again this year.  I tossed the photos out once viewing them.The camera takes high-definition video.  But this is only useful if one keeps the video in the camera without transferring it to a computer.  The video needs to be played from the camera to a HD TV.  The video can't be played on the computer using Windows Media Player.  One needs to download a free compatible program, \"VLC Media Player\".The camera will not record the date on the pictures.  I liked looking at my pictures taken with my old Cybershot knowing the date they were taken.  A real advantage when viewing a slide show or screensaver.Of course, this camera as all of the new cameras are memory hogs--4.5Mb/picture.  The increased number of megapixels is not worth it.The camera has a large LCD screen for viewing pictures.  This is a nice feature that all new cameras have.  It has no viewfinder.  So one has to use the LCD screen for framing pictures and viewing the many camera settings.  I don't have 20/20 near vision and this is a problem.  I don't like wearing reading glasses to take pictures.  Not many new cameras have viewfinders.I would not recommend this camera.

Today I returned the camera and ate the restocking fee.  I love everything about this camera EXCEPT for the picture quality.  On the camera's screen pictures appear to be amazing.  Just wait until you download them.  They are terrible! Here a short list of what I found to be unacceptable:1) The slightest movement from your subject creates blurry streaks.  I'm sure some artistic photographers may like this effect from time to time, but it happens when you use \"auto\" feature.  You can minimize this by manually adjusting the ISO, but you sacrifice picture quality.2) The flash is WAYYY to bright.  It washes out your subject 100% of the time indoors.  Again you can reduce the brightness of you flash in \"manual\" mode (which is a cool feature), but who wants to use trial and error to find perfect flash brightness EVERY time you use it indoors?3) The picture quality is POOR.  I read about 50 reviews on this site before purchasing the camera and it seemed like everyone loved it except for 10% who received lemons.  Well, I must have bought one of those lemons. I took 100 photos with the Sony H20 and compared them to those from my 6 year old Canon 5megapixel S50, and the Canon blows them away.  The Sony's pictures were grainy, or overexposed, or just blurry.  The best picture from this Sony was inferior to the worse picture from my Canon.Bottom line, the only explanation I have for the positive reviews of this camera is that Sony must have manufacturing quality control issues.

I don't know what the deal is now that they are selling it for $415, I certainly would not pay that much for this camera.I was looking for a good point and shoot camera that would take clear pictures indoors and outdoors. Also for a step up from my current Canon PowerShot A620. I wanted an improvement on image stabilization. The A620 was the last model before image stabilization was included in their next model, the A630. I wanted clearer pictures thinking the H20's 10MP and image stabilization would be better than the A620's 7.1MP picture quality. For the most part, the higher megapixels did give sharper pictures and image stabilization helped also.However first, I noticed some issues with the H20, the biggest being shutter action. The camera is great when taking pictures of non-moving subjects, but when you need to move with the subject, like taking photos of people moving around, sometimes pressing the shutter button does nothing because it seems that the camera is confused or busy thinking about what settings to choose for the picture. By the time it takes the picture about 2-3 seconds later, the scene has changed. As I used the camera, I noticed that this happens more than I like, compared to the A620 which doesn't have this shutter lag at all.Second, take a look at the photo I posted named \"Red Roses\" and notice the false intensity of the red color. This seems to be a consistent problem with the H20. Whenever I try photographing an object of bright color, like red, no matter what setting I use with the camera the color does not come out normal looking. The roses were taken outdoors on a hazy day with no flash.Third, the flash is too \"hot\" for some pictures. Even taking pictures in fully automatic mode, flash photos come out too bright, especially when taking food or close-up pictures.Maybe I am asking too much from a point-and-shoot camera, but I am going to look for a better camera, possibly a DSLR, since I think taking better pictures will be worth the added size and weight of a bigger and, more expensive camera.I gave the H20 to my teen daughter who is moving up from an old 2MP Sony camera, so she is happy with it, for now.", "Date": "September 17, 2010"}, {"Title": "Sony cybershot  Dsc-H20", "Author": "fs", "ReviewID": "R19P24XPE27IGH", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I did alot of research on cameras...I finally decided on the sony.....this camera takes awsome photos....I searched for accessories on Amazon and found an extra battery, carrying case, memory stick and protective film for lcd screen.... very cheap on Amazon...when you set the camera to easy ...just press the button ...and it does it all for you...the features to take a nice photo are amazing....the H20 blows away my last digital camera ...which was a sony dsc p72....I highly recommend this camera if you can find it", "Date": "August 14, 2010"}, {"Title": "LOVE THIS CAMERA!", "Author": "Allison L.

I immediately wanted to find a suitable camera replacement. After much research, I had decided to buy one of the most affordable Canon Cybershot cameras. But after I read an overwhelming number of user reviews who complained about how quickly their Canon battery died out and some even mentioned that they needed to bring along more batteries on an outing, I decided to go with my second camera choice.  At first I was dissapointed when I first held my new Sony camera. It felt cheap and flimsy. But after constantly using it for several weeks I have to say I quite pleased!. With my Sony I have been able to take amazing closeups (even though I'm only shooting at 5 megs instead of the maximum 10). I am also ecstatic about being able to use the zoom while videotaping, unlike my previous camera.(Sorry, I'm trying to type my review with my 3 yr. old sitting on my lap. She loves her Mommy...)  I am not giving my review a 5 star throughout only because that would mean perfection and at times (very few, though) I haven't been pleased with some blurry pictures, but I must admit that most probably it was my own fault because I still haven't bothered to read the instruction manual.

Ernst", "ReviewID": "RXTNNFSSPSF78", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I've had it for about six months now and I've taken about 3000 pictures so far.  I bought this to replace my canon power shot A95, and this was a nice upgrade.  The photo quality is much more crisp than my A95, and looks more like photos taken with an SLR than most point and shoots.  I like the 10x zoom.  It does well with macro photos. The image stabilization is definitely noticeable.  Also takes pretty good photos at night, they are fairly crisp and not too much graininess from the higher ISOs. For example, I took photos of downtown Baltimore from an airplane and it did surprisingly well, I used the manual photo mode and the photos were only slightly blurred and I was using some zoom and we were moving at about 150 mph. Chromatic aberrations (the bluish or purplish highlight along areas of sudden contrast from dark to light) are pretty much nonexistent with this sony.  I've used the beach and snow modes and it seems to do well in those areas that some point and shoots struggle with.  There are some photo editing tools built into the camera to edit photos before downloading them - some of them are kind of cool.  I haven't taken very many videos, but it seems to take decent videos for a still camera.  You can use the optical zoom while filming which seems pretty rare, and there isn't a maximum video time for the high res video - a lot of cameras put a 60 second cap on the highest resolution video.  I have a 8gb card that is more than enough - it holds about 1800+ photos and about 40 min of hd video.  Battery life is good, and it is nice that the camera estimates how many photos worth of battery life are left.Now for the cons:  This camera does not offer as many customizing features as my canon powershot did, which took me some getting used to.  Also the lens has a very narrow angle (not wide-angle at all), but on the flip side the photos have virtually no barrel distortion.  When taking photos in the landscape mode with really bright lighting I find the photos to be kind of washed out- but have been able to get around that usually by using the action mode or manual mode.  The colors are not always as vibrant as I like, and some colors just seem a little 'off'  Using some of the features in manual mode alleviate that for me, but it can be a hassle to use manual mode at times, or they can be fixed later in picassa.  The camera does not to well with certain hues of red in bright lighting - for example taking a photo of a bright pink or red rose in the sunlight the contrast of the flower itself will be off and have a very weird neon highlighting - this is something that is fairly common with point and shoots though - and I have not had a chance to play around with different features to see if there is an easy fix now that I have had the camera for a few months.Overall I am happy with the camera.  For the price it is excellent.  I think a camera in the $350-400 price range might fix some of the cons, but I'm not sure it is worth the extra cash.", "Date": "April 26, 2010"}, {"Title": "Great all-around pick", "Author": "Victoria", "ReviewID": "R1DFF1JQWBI1BA", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Ever since my Canon A630 bit the dust a few months ago, I've been searching and researching a replacement.  I tried several new Canon models and returned them the next day.  Boy, Canon just doesn't make point-and-shoots like they used to!  They are at the top of their game for DSLR, but everything in the $99-250 range is crap.  I initially shied away from Sony due to their memory cards not being SD, but I am so glad I gave this gem a try.  This camera takes great pics, the zoom is fantastic, and there is virtually no lag time between pics.  So many options - I have not even had the chance to try everything out yet!  It has many settings, takes video, 10X zoom, 10 megapixels, etc.  All around, a great buy!I'm going to attempt to make a list of pros and cons, although I'm really struggling coming up with the cons.  :)Pros:*Does not feel cheap or tiny.  I specifically stayed away from ultra-compact cameras after I tried out a Canon and hated the way it felt in my hands.*Very nice ergonomic touches with pads on the front and back for added support.*Zoom is excellent.*Picture quality is superb.*Easy mode allows the camera to adjust automatically.*Virtually no lag time, very quick recycling.*Fantastic overall value.Cons:*LCD screen does not rotate like on the Canon A630.  I would have loved to have the same option on this camera to be able to close the screen to prevent it from bumps and scratches.  I'll have to get screen protectors and keep it in a camera bag when traveling.  Not really a con, but something I noticed as a user.*Lens has a removable cover instead of a built-in automatic one.  Not sure if the zoom is the reason for this choice, but on my A630, the auto lens shutter broke, so maybe this isn't much of a con either.*Does not take SD cards.Overall, I am extremely satisfied with my purchase.

I have not been disappointed.  The camera is easy to use, takes excellent pictures, has an almost indetectable click-to-record delay, and has many other good features.

I can take a photo clear across the room, and it shows all kinds of details!  Another thing I love is that I do not constantly have to change setting from inside to outside, it senses it itself and uses flash accordingly.I love the loose lense cover (attached with a string), in this way I will not have to worry about the lense-protector breaking as with my other camera.I am sooooooo sticking with a Sony from now on!

Perhaps I have not been using the Lumix correctly (although I was using its Intelligent Auto which reviewers rave about), but I found its images to not be as crisp and sharp as the Sony's, by far.  Especially in low light, when using the flash, the quality in my opinion was awful, hazy and noisy.  It has a very weak flash, in contrast to the Sony, which has a sometimes too strong flash but which you can adjust to a lower intensity.  The Lumix does have the wide angle lens, which is useful, but not enough for me to forgive all its other flaws.The Sony, though lacking wide-angle zoom (which has been the case of most standard digital cameras up until now), has an excellent 10x zoom.  The pictures, even those of objects farthest away, are always extremely crisp.  Its stabilization system works wonders.  I find its 10x zoom is better than the Lumix's 12x.  Its macro is also better.I haven't explored the DSC-H20's little quirks and manual settings yet, or the HD video capability, but so far I think it is a great camera, and cheaper than many out there.

I was looking for a camera that took great quality pictures, and from using my old Sony with the Carl Zeiss lens, I was looking for another camera with the same quality. I was torn between the Canon SX 120 IS and the Sony H20 when my search began, but the Sony's lithium ion battery was what swayed me to it (I don't like using AA batteries).After using the camera for 6 months, I am more than happy with my decision. I have expanded on my photography in ways I couldn't have with a smaller point and shoot camera. I love having control of shutter speeds, focal ranges, and in learning how to use them properly have been able to take some fantastic pictures and really get into some of the more complex aspects of photography.  Even with all of the customization settings within this camera, it still has the fail proof iSCN auto mode if I just want the camera to do all the work.Some things I do wish this camera did have would be an automatic lens cover, and even though this camera is more of a superzoom point and shoot, a view finder would help in some of the picture compositions.

First, I am just going to say, This is hands down the best Point and Shoot camera that you will get for your money. I have owned several Point and Shoot cameras, and tried numerous others, and have never found one that competes with this. I own a DSLR, but when I go out hiking, I find that its a little bulky to be carrying around, which is why I ordered this one. I figured having a compact Point and Shoot would prove handy up in the hills. What I didn't count on is having a Point and Shoot camera that delivers such incredible images!!!PROSThis camera has Manual, Program, Auto, Easy, Scan, and Video modes. The Program Mode I enjoy because if I can go through and custom set image size, REC mode, EV, ISO, balance, focus, flash, etc. Its nice to be able to customize the shot your going to be taking. That said, the Auto mode does an INCREDIBLE job of choosing all that for you to deliver sharp, clear images time after time. When it comes to taking pictures, this camera has never disappointed me, and until it breaks it will be my carry-round camera.The camera is not flimsy like the $100 point and shoot you buy at Wal-Mart. When you pick up the camera, you can feel that it is durable. As I've mentioned before, I use this as my hiking camera. That means it gets pretty beat up, as I'm using it up in the mountains, where I have dropped it, had it slip out of my hands and fall into the river, gotten dirt, mud, and dust on it, and this thing keeps going. I do NOT recommend dropping it in the water! I had to let it dry out for over a week before it would function again, but it did indeed function just perfectly after drying out, which is a first in my point and shoot experience.The Macro mode on this camera is my favorite mode, and has delivered some pretty incredible images for me of flowers, mushrooms, insects, etc. If you enjoy taking Macro Shots, but aren't experienced with camera settings or adjustments, then just turn it to Auto mode, and it does a great job of recognizing when a Macro Shot is in the lens, and giving you that shot with excellent clarity.Has a timer mode, so you can set the camera up, hit the shutter, and join the picture before it goes off. I believe the timer settings are 2 sec, 10 sec, and 2 min.Lens cap is attached, so you never have to worry about losing it!CONSVideo mode- I did not buy this camera for the video recording, so I don't mind the poor video quality, but if your looking for a camera that shoots crystal clear video with perfect sound clarity, I'd look elsewhere. Video mode I have found lags as it tries to keep up with the action, and that gives you alot of noise in the image. Sound quality is all right, but not great.SUMMARY-All in all, this is an excellent camera for the price point, and I can't imagine it disappointing anyone!", "Date": "November 12, 2013"}, {"Title": "Great", "Author": "christopher ball", "ReviewID": "R1QSX4PRMZPHO9", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "For a point & shoot, I love this camera.

The flash lights up an entire room and is far exceptional to every point and shoot flash that I've tried out.  It's rated at 7.1M or about 21feet - most other point and shoots are in the 3-5M or 9-15ft range.  The lens at full zoom (380mm) is almost a full stop faster at F4.4 than most other comparable zoom which end up in the F5.4-F5.9 range, requiring more light and more time to capture the image.  The image stabilization works great and produces clear shake free images.  Using a Memory Stick Pro-HG Duo, it does a better job that ever other Point and Shoot camera I've tried (Kodak Z712, Panasonic FS27 and DMC-ZS5, Samsung HZ30W) at capturing moving subjects, especially in low lite.  Skin tones are true and subject definition is clear and precise.  Battery life great at well over 250 shots and it comes with a separate charger, so you can charge the battery out of the camera.CONS: There are some minor down sides to this camera.  The first is it's best and worst - the powerful flash - takes about 5 full seconds to recharge between shots and can sometimes over power close up subjects, but I think that's a small price to pay to not have every other indoor shot come out too dark.  Picture review is slow to come up taking about 2 seconds, and the separate lens cap is an annoyance. It's just a little too big to fit comfortably in your pocket, but can be carried in a pocket unlike the larger 'slr-like' point and shoot cameras. It does require a proprietary Sony Memorystick card.  (Newer Sony's will take those and the standard SDHC cards, so Sony finaly got the message).

Colors are very vivid.There are a lot of times when carrying a DSLR all the time is very daunting and not practical. This is where the DSC H20 comes in. Though not very slim and small, it can fit into a small bag. And its size justifies the image quality that it takes.Buy this camera and you will be happy!", "Date": "November 18, 2010"}, {"Title": "Great walk around P&S;!", "Author": "Shad J. Price \"Human Being\"", "ReviewID": "R39J36BWJMJ3F3", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "***Please note, did not buy through Amazon!***My wife and I received this camera last year as a Christmas gift.  We had been wanting a small point and shoot camera that we can easily grab and carry around with us rather than having to bring our bulky DSLR and all of it's accessories.  While it's not a DSLR replacement it gets the job done and in my opinion it is a very solid camera.We use it mostly as I believe it was designed to be used and rarely use anything outside of numerous automatic settings that are offered.  I have used it some in it's manual settings mode and found that it was fairly flexible and capable of some excellent pictures.  The quality of it's pictures in it's various auto-modes are very good and should not disappoint most people.  Personally, I found the camera produced images in auto-modes that were a little to vibrant for my tastes but again, this is my opinion only and this can be fixed through post-processing anyway.I was pleasantly surprised by the video quality of this little camera.  The ability to use the Zoom function while recording is a big plus too.  Again, it's not going to be as good as a HD video camera or some of the DSLR offerings out there that do HD Video but I think for the price and size that it is very good.  Watching directly from the camera on my 40-inch Samsung LCD TV produced good results albeit, with some clipping and color reproduction issues.Overall, I think this is a great little point and shoot camera and recommend it to anyone who cares about picture/video quality and doesn't mind it coming in a slightly chunkier package.  The weight feels good in your hand and the generous hand grip (for a point and shoot at least) is really helpful for one handed shooting.My only complaints are the over-vibrant picture output in auto mode and the old school lens cap that you have to take on and off.  These are personal nit-picks and may not even bother most.  :)", "Date": "October 8, 2010"}, {"Title": "Love it!!!!!!", "Author": "sharpie", "ReviewID": "R2JNA72WWTQ33Z", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I just love this camera!

I have tried, unsuccessfuly, using both the automatic settings as well as manipulating the manual settings to take clear pictures that show the true color of the subject. This camera simply cannot capture blues and reds correctly, no matter how much I've worked the settings this camera still cannot get the colors right. I even sat down with a professional photographer who agreed there was an issue with my camera. It is also a low performer in low light situations without the flash, taking a really grainy picture. And speaking of the flash, it's just way too bright. I have to adjust it lower whenever I plan to use it otherwise it washes out the color of the subject. The internal stabilizer is also a disappointment. If I don't hold my breath and keep as still as possible, my shots end up blurred. It also takes a long time to focus and seems confused on what it should be focusing on even though I've made the change to that setting. In ideal lighting situations it does a nice job, but so do a lot of other cameras out there. Long story short, I am very disappointed in this camera.

It is too tiny for the camera's demands and does not hold a charge for long at all--even with the view screen on \"normal\" as others have stated. I hardly ever had to recharge my Fujifilm, which could hold a charge for weeks and hundreds of pictures.I also don't like how this camera does not come with a power adapter cord for use when uploading pictures. Maybe you have a fancy all-in-one media slot in your computer, but I don't, so I still need to use the USB cable. And that's where if I get sidetracked editing some photos and leave the camera on the battery will drain down to nothing in minutes.This is also one of those digital cameras that doesn't capture motion at all in the automatic setting. Unless the subject is perfectly still, chances are the picture will be blurry.It is also too large to really carry easily. I suppose you have to know it's not a \"pocket\" camera, but I'm a guy and this doesn't fit anywhere on my person. You need some kind of case. If you want to have a camera handy \"just in case,\" this is not the camera.Oh, and don't get me started about the cheesy manual plastic lens cap.

The second time I used it, I noticed the zoom trigger wasn't operating. It was stuck and instead of gliding, it had to be pushed real hard to become unstuck then it didn't seem to zoom correctly.  Also, each battery that goes in the battery charger provided, now doesn't work.  I get a screen message that says, \"only compatable battery will work with this camera\".  I am very sorry that those two things do not function at 100% but instead 50%, cause it was a great buy!

I am a very experienced user and I understand well the functions of this camera, how to shoot and divide the light metering on a screen, choose shutter speeds and iris functions, target correct ISO to prevent image noise, choose a great color mode etc. Please consider that ween you read the following:Pros:Great constructionGreat lensGreat basic featuresExcellent ergonomicsWas considered high megapixels when it came out (now 10.1mp is below average)Great battery life per chargeVery nice HD videoCons:Photos appear great on LCD, but when you transfer them to the computer, everything is out of focus and horribly pixalated. That is true even for excellent light conditionsThis camera is unable to do macro. About 1 out of 20 shots come out right  in terms of focus (but then it's probably a very noisy photo). The camera has a strange auto-focus function: You see it focuses on the object perfectly, it then pass the focus point and remains blurring the image. You constantly have to change the setting, lighting or your angle to capture macro objects and trick the camera to put them in focus. Often you have to stand far and zoom into it, but then you have to put the camera on a tripod because touching it when taking a macro photo from afar will cause it to move and blur the photo. It's really very-very poor.Night shots are very poor quality when comparing with other camerasMemory Stick Duo is slow and proprietary. Chances are you will need an adapter for most computers out there.Camera takes long time to turn on and take a first photoDifficult to operate manual modes, very limited.SLR-like form factor accommodates large lens, but the lens cannot be interchanged.Flash cannot be adjusted and your choice is either burnt photos or dark noisy photosA bit heavy and bulky for its size. It's not an SLR but it's also not something you can carry in your pocket. In other words, you are robbed out of the benefits of SLR but you don't gain the compact benefits of a point-and-shoot travel size camera (which may have similar specs and price point) so it's quite pointlessWhat you see on the LCD is NOT what you see on the PC. In fact, if you read the manual there are many troubleshooting tips where Sony themselves tell you that dots, streaks, wrong colors, etc. that you see on the LCD are not recorded in the real photo. What's thr point of this? The LCD should ALWAYS represent EXACTLY what you will see on your computer screen. Moreover, because it is small, you cannot see how pixalated, noisy or out of focus the photos really are, which you discover later when you transfer them to your computer.  This means you have to always take many redundant photos with changed focus, settings and angles just to make sure. It makes the photo taking an annoyance. Not only is it not fun but you run out of disc space and have to then sort many more photos than reasonable -just to dig a few good ones.Sony's instructions also keep suggesting to avoid all kinds of terrible results by changing the scene, lighting angle or how you center objects in your photo.  I am sorry, but a scene should NEVER accommodate a camera. Camera is a passive device that helps the person behind it tell a story and document or memorize a scene.  My camera should never dictate the scene itself.Overall, poor camera. It is probably best to get a nice point-and shoot or a nice SLR rather than this failing hybrid.

What I look for in a digital camera is one that can easily be used out of the box, without having to start fiddling with all the settings. I bought the Sony DSC-H20 based on the mostly positive reviews here on Amazon and based on another family member buying a Sony (not this model) and saying that they loved it.Frankly, I can't see why people give this camera such glowing reviews. Pictures in intelligent mode with the flash on came out with colors way off. I took a picture of a maroon red pair of shorts, and they came out looking light red - almost pink. When I turned the flash off, I got a much better picture, but still nowhere near as good as the pictures I used to get on my Kodak Z1015IS. And besides, the whole point of intelligent mode is so the user shouldn't have to play around with the camera to find the right settings for every shot. I also found that the camera insisted on using the flash outdoors on a sunny day in intelligent mode, which again made the pictures come out with the wrong color.In short, compared to Kodak cameras, the picture quality of this camera doesn't even come close. If you care about the colors being correct, I would stay away from this camera.", "Date": "August 5, 2009"}, {"Title": "Sony is very difficult to deal with.", "Author": "D.
