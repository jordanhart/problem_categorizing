I am usually a Canon shooter and was interested in evaluating something from another manufacturer and this unit did not disappoint.Image QualityThis of course is what any camera evaluation must center on - as without taking good pictures even the most stylish and easy to use camera will come up short. I have taken a number of pictures in different settings from daylight to night. Images are generally sharp and with good contrast. Focus is usually pretty quick but not always accurate. I was surprised that the camera in low light / auto setting tends to not activate the flash, instead decresing shutter to as low as 1/30 second - which leads to blurriness in pictures with moving kids. When the flash did activate, it was of limited strength and illuminated objects / people only quite close to the camera. For detailed analysis, I took comparison shots with this camera and both a dSLR and another point and shoot camera, both from Canon. I was surprised at how well this camera does with stationary subjects in low light - Sony has really done a great job there. Please see the video portion of this review for details on the analysis. A word about the 16 MP chip on this camera - please don't make the mistake thinking this camera is significantly better than a 14 MP camera and way better than a 12 MP camera - as that is not a valid assumption. The camera chip is only capable of conveying what the optics deliver to it - and optics on a point and shoot by definition / size can't deliver what larger lenses with a dSLR can do. What a 16 MP camera does mean, however, is larger file sizes to fill a hard drive more quickly. This is not a criticism of this particular camera but just something to consider when looking at the whole class of high megapixel point and shoot cameras in general. Increased megapixels beyond about 12 are really not needed by very many photographers. On the other hand, one cannot always haul the big dSLR everywhere and having a point and shoot available is critical since the camera you have with you is the best one for the job - and this one does very well indeed.Form FactorThis is a very small camera. about 3/4 inch shorter than an iPhone and just a bit thicker. It fits very comfortably in a pocket. The lens protector reveals the lens and flash when slid down and also turns the unit on. Buttons are few including an on/off switch and a bit of an oddly designed zoom button which moves back and forth to zoom in and out. The position of the buttons does make operating the zoom function with one hand a bit awkward. Most functions including triggering movie recording are handled via touch screen.User InterfaceThis camera is clearly strongly influenced by the iPhone with touch screen providing most of the functionality. As others have said, the touch screen is not as responsive as an iPhone but it works well enough. I did find myself trying to \"swipe\" from screen to screen which often resulted in inadvertent opening of a menu item. I firmly believe in the principle that a UI should be self-explanatory without referral to manuals and therefore used this camera without looking at the manual (at least that is my excuse for not reading it). Some of the icons were not obvious such as the different quality settings for video, but overall I was able to self-teach the use of the camera over a few minutes.Memory StorageI was a bit surprised that the camera uses MICRO SD cards, not the more standard SD cards. I have a bunch of SD cards for other cameras and after opening the box on this one I had to go shopping. I guess I should have been happy that I could use a micro SD card which with an adapter can be used with an SD card reader as Sony could have used only the micro Memory Stick (this camera can use either). Anyone remember Betamax?BatteryBattery charge was quite rapid - I think it charged fully in less than 45 minutes for me. Battery life decreased by a segment after a few minutes of video and 30 or so pictures, many with flash. It is true that a Li Ion cell does not demonstrate its full potential for several charge / discharge cycles so this may well improve. Battery is rated at 630 mAh which is a pretty low number, however. I suspect this is another sacrifice (along with micro SD card use) to make the camera as small as possible.Extra FeaturesI was looking forward to the panorama feature as Sony's TV ads showing that seem to indicate the camera will be taking a series of high-resolution pictures and seamlessly splicing them together for you. If you have ever done that job manually in Photoshop, it is a hassle (though there are now a number of software options for that). In any case, the output from this camera is normally a 4608x3456 image, so I thought a panorama might be, say, 12,000x3456 - but that is not the case. The panorama shot ends up being 4912x1080 so while it is panoramic side to side there is a lot less information there than I was hoping for - in fact the panorama shot is 5.3 MP (compared to 16 MP for a regular picture). It does at least allow wider shots to be completed, though I prefer Canon's solution to this - after panorama sequence is selected a ghost image of the first shot allows easy lining up of the second shot and so forth and the camera does not change settings between shots so they are easy to splice together later on.Overall, I am very pleased with this camera and with its small size and ease of use I plan to use it a lot.", "Date": "October 27, 2011"}, {"Title": "My new daily camera!", "Author": "Joshua M. Levine", "ReviewID": "RTDDMA8TYGQFI", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "My old TX-9 body is bruised and its screen is cracked. I have tried every new Sony and Canon that has come out in the past few years, but none were good enough to take its place.Now, finally, I have a new camera to carry- the TX55!For me, the two OVERWHELMINGLY most important features in a day-to-day camera are quickness and pocketability. Nothing else about a camera matters if I miss the picture because (1) I waiting for the camera, or (2) I don't have the camera with me. The TX-55 is a winner on both accounts.This camera is fast. Thanks to the sliding lens cover and super-fast startup, I can pull the Tx-55 out of my pocket and take a picture in about 1 second. I think it is the fastest pocket-to-picture camera currently available.This camera is handy. It is small and thin enough to fit in my front pocket along with my wallet, so I always have it with me and ready to shoot.The camera also has very good image quality considering its size and speed- certainly good enough for daily use. I am very impressed with the low light response too. I've taken some pictures at night where the camera saw things that I didn't see with my eyes.Minor Gripes: Has a proprietary USB connection so you need yet another cable, but it does charge via USB so you don't need to carry a charger. Movie start/stop is controlled via a touch screen button rather than the shutter release which takes some getting used to. In Image+ and HDR mode, the screen displays \"PROCESSING\" while it is still capturing images, so you have to be careful to keep aiming until it is completely done. There does not seem to be a way to have it take multiple shoots with different settings (like one without flash and one with) on a single shutter release press. Does not have built in GPS geocoding.CONCLUSION: After a very long search, this is my new daily camera and I love it.", "Date": "October 11, 2011"}, {"Title": "A study in tradeoffs", "Author": "Ammy_Evaluator", "ReviewID": "RUTHR7CXMSE5D", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "It seems like the designers of this camera were given just one instruction - design the smallest, lightest, most compact camera possible. And certainly, this is hands down the sleekest and most portable camera I have ever used. Add a breathtaking 3.3\" OLED display to its gorgeous form factor and you have an awesome looking device. It's almost a fashion statement in itself! And, as long as one doesn't expect miracles from a near-credit card sized device, the image quality is quite reasonable.Unfortunately, a number of tradeoffs were necessary to achieve this.1. Size MattersThis is definitely a try-before-you-buy camera. There are unique challenges with a body this svelte. I often covered up the microphone inputs (very hard to avoid). The twig-like joystick zoom control felt very unnatural. It was needlessly difficult to open the shutter cover (no grooves to assist your fingers). And, I struggled with inserting the MicroSD card (it is possible to insert it incorrectly - so much so that Sony includes a separate instruction sheet just for this!).2. Image QualityI had significantly more keepers with outdoor daylight images than with indoor flash images. Daylight images were  sharp, with great color tonality. However, indoor images were much softer and lacked the same \"pop\".3. UI is an acquired tasteThe lack of hard buttons increases the need for the touchscreen interface to be just right. Unfortunately the TX55 has some UI quirks.## The user interface uses non standard idioms. For instance, a finger drag scrolls images, but a single tap zooms into an image. This drove me insane until I figured out the right finger press/flick technique. What's cool though is that finger flick speed actually controls how many images are scrolled through.## It takes a ridiculous 3 clicks to get into playback mode when the camera is off. Click to power on. Dismiss a \"slide down lens cover to shoot\" warning dialog. And then hit a teeny tiny PLAY button!## Instructional dialogs cannot be turned off. You'll get one of these each time you customize quick menu buttons.## Without hard buttons, even the 3.3\" display feels very cramped with all the touch screen buttons. It is surprisingly easy to hit the wrong button, which I did more than once, especially in the Settings menu.## On the plus side, you can customize your interface by selecting up to 4 buttons that show up in each mode. For instance in Program mode, I have buttons to control exposure, ISO, flash settings, and to start recording.4. Complicated functionsI find it depressing that cameras today come with so little accompanying information to get a new user started. It took me work to even display exposure details in playback mode, and to figure out user interface nuances. In addition, marketing-speak obscures a lot of the function. For instance, in addition to the standard digital zoom, this camera now has \"Clear Image Zoom technology\" zoom. The difference? You get 5x optical zoom; then another 5x of Clear Image Zoom (out to 10x); and then a final 10x of digital zoom (upto 20x). I am very sensitive to any kind of digital zooming, and did not care to use this function.Conclusion:########The target user seems to be a beginner photographer who values a camera that provides true point-and-shoot capability, is simple to use, is unobtrusive, and is elegantly attractive. Features such as the ability to compose panoramic views and to take in-camera High Dynamic Range (HDR) pictures are becoming standard across Sony's range, and are present here too. Other features, such as in-camera painting with a provided stylus, while unique, seem less than useful.It is to be noted that this camera is definitely not targeted at the enthusiast - there is not even the pretense of manual control, and even the usual histogram display is absent. If you're looking for manual control - then the Canon S95 or the S100 should be your choice.In the end, my rating of 3 stars felt appropriate, with the loss of two stars for the reasons I mention above.Personally, I find this just the right camera to have in my pocket when visiting with friends, where my full rig is simply too conspicuous.Happy Clicking!", "Date": "October 29, 2011"}, {"Title": "Limitations of size and touchscreen mar otherwise great camera", "Author": "J. Gitzlaff", "ReviewID": "R3G4V2HFFIDD4N", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "After using this camera for several weeks, I can confirm that on the whole, it's an amazing little device.  Small in size, slim in profile, and low in weight, it looks and feels like it's worth every penny you pay for it.  Picture quality is excellent considering the tradeoffs Sony made in keeping the enclosure so small.  On the whole, pictures taken with this camera have excellent sharpness, good contrast, and bright but not oversaturated colors.  If you pay attention to ambient light, shooting conditions and so forth (in other words, if you do your job as photographer), you'll get very creditable results that compete well with any portable on the market.  As recently as 2-3 years ago it would have been inconceivable to expect such high quality from such a small camera.That said, there are physical tradeoffs from small size.  For instance, the camera is so small it can be hard to grip without accidentally putting a finger on your own lens, the flash, or the rear touchscreen.  It feels a little like holding a bar of soap.  The camera's small size sometimes makes it harder to hold level and steady.  The shutter button is connected to the power button, and both of them are kind of small and offer very little 'give.'  This seems to make it hard for someone (a friend or waiter, for instance) to take a picture quickly if they aren't already used to the camera.  And the front dust cover slides down in a way that makes it VERY easy to accidentally smudge your lens with fingerprints.The OLED touchscreen is very bright and pretty, and its amazing how many controls are right there at your fingertip.  It's wonderful at night and indoors, but outdoors in bright sunlight it's passable.  However, the touchscreen is not QUITE as responsive as many of us have come to expect with our recent crops of smartphones and tablets, and some of the virtual buttons are incredibly small and (sometimes) cryptically labeled.  The phone doesn't come with a paper manual, so many of the menu items and selections are unexplained (\"Intelligent Auto\" versus \"Superior Auto\" anyone?) leaving you to guess and experiment.In sum, I like it a lot but I don't love it:  I prefer my Canon S95, which has more intuitive controls (for me) and better performance in low light and with fast-moving subjects.  But my wife disagrees, prefering this camera's size and touchscreen and content with the tradeoffs.", "Date": "November 16, 2011"}, {"Title": "Tiny and Fast", "Author": "Seth Lankford", "ReviewID": "R298HKMMFGTHF2", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I got my TX55 10/11/2011 but I have not been able to play with it enough to give it a full review yet.

Stylish and extremely portable. At about a little less than 1/2 an inch thick, it makes my Sony Cyber-Shot DSC-WX9 16.2 MP Exmor R CMOS Digital Still Camera with Carl Zeiss Vario-Tessar 5x Wide-Angle Optical Zoom Lens and Full HD 1080/60i Video (Black) look fat.PROS:- The Exmor R is clear, can potentially capture amazing pictures, and is versatile with its stunning full 1080p recording. The lenses (Exmor R) is much similar,  almost identical to other Sony Camera families (Sony Wx series, Sony Hx series).- As I've mentioned, this camera is unbelievably sleek and thin.- The design is very good, with an analog zoom stick (left and right), picture snap button, and placement of the flash and lense. The front cover of the camera is very simple, yet elegant, with just \"Sony\" and \"cybershot.\"- Many modes - Along with many of the familiar modes (auto, background defocus, iso, landscape), there are also fun new modes like miniature, partial color (very fun), partial monochrome, high-speed action capture, and more.- Batteries are cheap. I've bought about 2 generic batteries here on Amazon at about $5 a piece.- Touchscreen interface is very user friendly. Vertically on the left column, you have the menu, video recording button, flash, timer, and help. Vertically on the right column, battery life, amount of photos and video time left, picture mode, and play button. Very intuitive and easy to use.- You can use both microSD and Sony pro duo memory cards.CONS- Touchscreen can be better. While it's already good, I've noticed occasionally that I need to touch a point twice.- Zoom picture quality isn't so great, especially anywhere in the 3x to 5x zoom. Picture is grainy. However, with a little zoom, picture quality is still very good.CONCERNS- The camera doesn't have any ridges or way to keep the camera secure when taking pictures. I haven't experienced any close calls or near drops, but the camera's thin build can potentially be a nuance. It's really not a problem, more of a concern.- While the front cover provides good protection of the camera's internals (lense, flash), there is a small gap (about 1mm wide) separating the bottom from the sliding top cover. Dust, small debris, gunk, anything can get stuck in that gap. If I ever spill anything by accident, it may be difficult to clean. However, with proper care, like with all electronics, there shouldn't be any issue. Just something to be aware of.Overall, this Sony TX55 is stylish, sleek, has good picture shooting quality, has amazing full HD video recording, and has a good but not perfect touchscreen interface. This camera is definitely more of a luxury, considering in the $285 - $350 range you can get a solid camera with better zoom and lenses size. If you want pictures with good quality with some style, this is perfect. If you want a more performance for the $300 range, I recommend the Sony Cyber-shot DSC-HX9V 16.2 MP Exmor R CMOS Digital Still Camera with 16x Optical Zoom G Lens, 3D Sweep Panorama and Full HD 1080/60p Video, or any camera in the Sony Hx series.", "Date": "December 8, 2011"}, {"Title": "If You Like to Point and Shoot, This is It", "Author": "R.

You have to buy an SD card, or live with the fact that you can only take about four pictures at a time, and the touch screen, while it works, isn't the most responsive thing ever. But this doesn't actually bother me. I have an ancient Samsung Eternity, and love it. Flawless touch screens are obviously not my highest priority.But these are minor issues, and I'm still in love.The TX55 is very small, and very light. I was a little bit apprehensive when I first received it. The size, weight, and front of the camera lend it a slightly cheap look. It's adorable, don't get me wrong. I just worried a little bit.Until I took my first batch of photos.At 16.2 megapixels, top of the line lense, excellent zoom function, (fabulous) landscape option,  excellent low-light photos, ability to shoot HD video and 3D enabled video (there's more, but these are the features that pertain to me more than anything else) I could not have asked for a camera better-suited to me. The quality of the photos is amazing. I was actually blown away. I will be the first to admit that I have little experience with point-and-shoot cameras. I've only owned a few, and I've used them all to death. The last one I received five years ago (when it was top of the line for its class), and it died in March. Comparing shots between that one and this one--well, you actually can't compare, because this one is so much better.The TX55 is smaller than my cell phone, and fits anywhere--pocket, purse, bag, drinkholder, shirt pocket, and so on. I take it everywhere. I really, really, really, really love it, to the point where I will buy the next CyberShot model when this one dies (hopefully that day is a looooooong way off.)It's also sturdy. I spilled sticky chili sauce all over it. Leached under the lense cover and around the battery and everything. It's not only still alive, and one cleaned lense later, just as good as it was before (if you discount the sour chili smell.)It boots up very quickly. Flip the lense cover, it's on, and ready to shoot.I say go for it. I know the price is a little bit steep, but it's far from the most expensive one on the market, and the quality actually does outweigh the price. You're kind of getting a bargain. It's that good.

In fact I find myself leaving my big Nikon at home more often and just bringing along this little photo gem. The durability of the camera has also impressed me - I keep it in my computer bag and it gets knocked around on airplanes, thrown into rental cars and generally neglected until I need it.

Sony support was an easy online form and they fixed it at no cost.

The sensor is top notch and Sony has put a lot of exciting features in this generation of Cyber-Shot. I haven't seen better in this size package (including the EXLIMs).

Definitely a plus for travel.* Image quality - Images taken in most conditions are top notch, on par with the S95.* Battery life is good, especially for the size.The Not-so-Good:* Usability is rough - I expect a touch screen to act like the iPhone, and this is nowhere near as responsive. I often have to touch the screen multiple times to register.* Touch screens on cameras are problematic because of the lack of non-touch surface - I had a lot of issues taking photos without hitting the screen and taking it out of shooting mode. There is no way to comfortably hold the camera, when compared to non-touch-screen models that you can grip around both sides.* No battery charger - Instead of a compact battery charger, this camera comes with a USB cable and power adapter. I find this rather annoying to take around when traveling when compared to Canon's battery charger, which has no cables.These are just the basics, but I could not dig any deeper without getting frustrated and giving up. For me, the camera was almost unusable. My wife struggled through it for quite a few months before going back to her Canon for good. My impression is that the camera is sold to compete with high-end touch-screen phones, and the photo and video quality is certainly well above the best phones, but... I don't want to carry two devices in my pocket when one will suffice.My recommendation: If you do not care about video quality, look for a good deal on a used Canon S95.

It's only my personal opinion/observation, based on a few weeks with this camera and using them side by side with Sony TX10 and Canon S95 (first is a direct relation in the TX line, and the 2nd is very similar in price with a Sony Exmor sensor, yet very different).Pros-Very thin and light, to an extreme.-Excellent assembly quality, feels solid despite its light weight-very sleek, you can probably pull it out at fashion parties without feeling ashamed.-wide angle at 25mm is always nice to have.-AMAZING video capability. Nothing else near this size class comes close.-Gigantic touch OLED touch screen that's vivid and sharp, with a very high 1229k pixel resolution.-Touch screen is capacitive and quite sensitive (almost too sensitive).-Lots of technology and photo tricks, such as built in HDR, Panorama, background defocus, motion detection, various picture effects and scene modes, 3D shots, touch to focus & follow, etc.-3D photos and panorama with just one lens! It's a proprietary technology that takes burst photos at different angles to generate a real 3D image. (No 3D video since it'll require two lenses)-Fantastic macro capability down to merely 1cm (0.39\").-Responsive Intelligent Auto Mode that can be nearly fool-proof for every imaginable situation (i.e. you can leave it in iA and shoot away).- The Superior Auto mode burst shoots several frames and stacks them together in post processing to compensate for motion blur (among other things like contrast correction, sharpness enhancement, and noise reduction, etc.). I find it extremely useful as it really works wonders at saving some low light images that would have otherwise been lost. The processing takes a little time per each shot, however.-Good low light performance.- Focus is fairly fast and accurate (better than S95)- Outstanding flash control, even at very short distances.Cons:- General ergonomics - The sensitive touch screen can easily get in the way of operating this tiny camera that's almost all screen on one side and which has very little space to rest your hands/fingers otherwise. Even if Sony allowed for the on-screen interface to be turned off, the default layout can still leave the movie record button on screen, that is still easily actuated.- Image quality suffers from the high pixel count on a small area (a fairly typical 1 / 2.3\"), resulting in noise appearing as early as 400ISO (while that is probably usual for other pocket cameras, for Exmor that is low) and gets progressively worse after that. The camera has very aggressive noise reduction and will make images appear smeared at higher ISOs--i.e. on close up it'll look like an oil painting.- Probably inherent of a folding lens design, corner blurriness and vignetting is an easily observable issue (if you care about this you'd go mad), especially at wide angle, where barrel distortion is also obvious.- Relatively short battery life, around 210-230 frames in continuous shooting, from experience.-the brilliant OLED screen has an Achille's heel: it is not only difficult but nearly impossible to see on a sunny day, even with brightness turned all the way up.- The unit I received has a tendency to slightly under-expose (by about 1/3 stop), both with and without flash.- smaller maximum aperture at f/3.3- the charging/data connector and cable is proprietary.More on the screen/ergonomics:Something needs to be said about the giant and advanced capacitive touch screen. This camera feels like the Sony TX-10 stripped of its shockproof and waterproof armor, resulting in a much thinner and lighter camera that shares many attributes (but not identical). One major change is from Sony's LCD hybrid screen to an even higher resolution (1229k vs 921k) and larger (3.3\" over 3.0\") OLED screen. OLED is a newer technology that yields brilliant colors. However, the hybrid LCD was able to perform under direct sunlight, something the OLED screen completely failed at. It didn't even need direct sunlight, but a sunny day was enough to keep me from seeing much of anything on the beautiful screen. Furthermore, as the controls are all touch-screen based, that can be a real problem (e.g. if you just want to turn up the brightness).If you have large hands or large fingers, you'll probably have some frustration with using this camera. The touch screen is enormous at 3.3\", covering the entire back of the camera that's a half inch thin. However, the buttons and controls aren't always generously sized, or the interface design the most polished. For example: in settings menu, you may want to slide through the long list of options iphone-style, by tap-hold-drag-release in the center of the screen. However, you may end up actuating those options accidentally. When you opt to use the scroll bar to avoid such accidents, you'll also find it to be exceedingly small, and somewhat difficult to successfully drag with your fingertips.During all shoot modes, all the control buttons are at the edge of the screen, making it very easy to touch and actuate accidentally. The screen is very sensitive, to the point that you don't even have to touch it to register (fingertip to screen around 1mm will do it)--a phenomenon that's probably responsible for most accidents and doube-taps as reported. You'd have to carefully hold the camera by the edges, and shooting with one hand gets pretty tricky, if not practically impossible. Sony does include a control-off button to turn off on screen buttons, leaving just the video record button (in the default layout, which can be removed with customization), and it maybe acceptable for those who never really change the settings much.Video Record:Sony opted to leave out all physical buttons but for the shutter and power, as well as a short stalk for zoom. I didn't find the zoom control problematic as some others, but thought it rather an ingenious and effective solution for such a thin body with an enormous screen. However, I did wish that Sony had preserved the physical video record button, for two reasons: screen-control-off button can really turn off *all* the touchy controls (in default layout), and that it is far more accurate and easier to actuate a physical button rather than a touch screen one, especially when it has to be located on the OTHER side of the shutter. Even in video shooting mode, the physical shutter button is reserved for still capture during video, and I still have to use the on-screen button with my left hand to start and stop video recording. It simply is not as intuitive or reassuring as a physical button on the right hand side, close to the shutter--such as on the older TX10, and many other new HD video capable cameras (Canon S100, Panasonic LX5, Canon ELPH 310HS, to name a few). There are many missed video opportunities as a result. This didn't seem to be a problem at first, yet eventually proved to seriously compromise the usability of TX55's powerful video capturing feature. I imagine it is a problem that can be easily corrected with software--e.g. an option to relegate the main shutter button as video record in dedicated video mode.Shutter Button/Sliding Cover:The shutter button on my unit lacks tactile feedback, and uses an obviously hinged design, evinced by the very uneven pressure needed to actuate it from the opposing edges of the elongated button. The sliding cover has a peculiar design that makes it flush with the body, but can also make it tricky to open smoothly. The cover lifts away from the body when it is opened; so if your hand pressures the cover against the body at the leading edge, you may not be able to open the cover at all. The smooth paint with little traction does not help either. The trick is to pressure and slide on the top of the cover, and it'll open rather easily. That said, I'm really not a fan of moving parts on a camera, particularly sliding covers that will eventually trap dirt and possibly even scratch. I find it completely avoidable, and would be better served with an iris lens cover. (e.g. older Sony T's and Minoltas X's)Summary:This camera is not meant for photo enthusiasts. The controls are difficult to manipulate quickly (yes, even if it is a touch-screen), the ergonomics are not conducive to visceral shooting, and if you are finicky about image details, the blurry corners and noise reduction artifacts will have you throw this camera against the wall.However, that is not what this camera is meant for. For enthusiasts, the outgoing Canon S95 better caters to the needs to control photographic parameters and image quality, especially now its cost has come down to similar levels (at the time of this writing).This camera is good for those without much photographic knowledge, but just want to press the shutter and get a decent image in all situations; appreciate style in a thin and beautifully designed package, which also happens to be feature laden. This camera is a compilation of desirable features and acronyms in a competitive consumer segment. If you can name it, TX55 probably has it, plus a few more.Those who want a powerful video camera that will fit in a jeans pocket need to look no further: with 60fps 1080i, AVCHD, stereo audio encoded in Dolby Digital AC-3, built in HDMI, optical image stabilization, EXMOR high sensitivity imaging chip, 25mm wide angle, optical AF and 5x zoom during video, in a package that is merely 3.8oz(109g) and 17/32\" (13mm) thin--this camera has no competition in terms of video performance/size ratio. No one comes even close.The camera is very small that I find people mistaken it for a phone often--in fact, it has almost the same dimensions as an old Motorola RAZR V3. It packs a powerful set of features and cutting edge technology that can be quite impressive and even fun. However, where it fails is exactly where it tries too hard: the long folding zoom and high pixel count undoubtedly hampered image quality, while the sensitive and large touch screen combined with such a thin body inadvertently makes for tricky ergonomics. It is a very ambitious camera with a lot of startling engineering.

Small and a feels like it's well built.* Picture quality - picture quality seems on par with a camera of this size and without a lens that extends out when turned on.* Beautiful and functional touchscreen - OLED is gorgeous and touch controls work well.Cons:* Touch screen - I just really prefer manual controls on a camera other than my iPhone.* slide cover - for some reason the slide cover will always turn on in my wife's purse even though it's in a case.  The camera is supposed to be her backup camera but it never works as that because the battery is always dead.* PMB photo software - maybe I'm used to downloading images off my Canon camera's, but I find using PMB to be a pain.* The one external control the camera does have is now broken - after a year in my wife's purse and being stored in a case, I found the the zoom control doesn't un-zoom any more.  I have to shut the lens cover and then open it again to reset it.  Maybe this is a one-off but it has happened.Summary:I was excited to get this camera for my wife, but our experience hasn't been a positive one.

Reason for purchase was to be able to capture images unobtrusively in a country I am headed to shortly.  The country is kind of infamous for street crime :)I wanted quality without looking like an obvious money-bags tourist.  Selection was primarily based on other respected reviews on Amazon.  While most of what I have to say is already addressed, let me say that I am elated.  Moved into digital photography a decade ago with the Nikon D200.  Subsequently traded up to the D700.  I have compared photos taken with the D700 and a Canon G12 - with this TX55.  Extremely hard to differentiate!  Sure, a view-finder would have been nice but that would probably add to the physical size.  Preparation is key.  If I intend using the camera outside in bright sunlight I ensure the LCD is up in max brightness.Digitals have come a long ways in fuzzy logic.  A panned scene, for instance, no longer requires software processing for effective patching of multiple shots into a seemless view.  It is automatic  within this camera.  For most applications I find the Auto mode adequate; the camera effectively sizes the situation and adjusts likewise.  Commenting on the touch-screen feature: When we touch an icon the ball of the fingertip is intended to land dead-centre but this is seldom the case; the actual contact, in my case, seems to be slightly from the side of the fingertip.  This, factored-in/allowed for, results in accurate command.  Also, the touch execution appears to occur when the finger is 'lifted off' the icon as against the actual finger-press.  This, incidentally, is true with respect to the iPod Touch 4 as well.That said, I would highly recommend a thorough reading of the camera manual.  Come back and read it again.A link I found to be particularly helpful:  [...]Yes, this machine offers the facility for fine-tuning and customizing White Balance just as with professional DSLRs - all in a tiny package.

I've never had a good opinion of tiny point-n-shoots, despite never having used one. I've always equated a small size as something a person buys as a no hassle camera. While that's true here, it's also a bit above just that in some ways.Its size is the biggest asset and problem at the same time.ProsIt's easily pocket-portableIt's no hassle to bring along \"just in case.\"ConsThe shutter and power buttons are too close together. Also, the shutter is almost flush with the casing, making it difficult to press and hold the camera still.It will take time to find a comfortable grip so your fingers aren't over the lens. You have to grip it around the edges.due to its size, it can be hard holding the camera steady when zooming or trying to track a subjectThe movie mode button, although on the touch screen, can be accidentally activated while holding the camera.The other \"major\" issue I've had with the camera is the mounting socket (if that's the proper name, I'm not sure!) is not standard size like every other camera I've owned. I brought it into a camera shop and asked the owner, who has been there for 20+ years, if they had a mini-tripod or an adapter to use it with the mini-tripod I have. His replies were: \"Did you get this overseas?\" \"I've never seen anything like it before.\" \"Typical Sony, you probably have to get something from them.\" The only small tripod I could find on Sony's site has been discontinued.All the negative comments aside, I really do like this little camera for the portability. It has quite a few modes/effects that you can use while taking photos that give you a decent variation of arty alternatives to a normal photo. The day I got it I was off to a Duran Duran concert so I figured it would be a good testing ground. With my Canon, I had to fiddle with the settings at concerts to find the sweet spot. I set the Cyber-shot on \"Intelligent\" mode and got some great shots without the fiddling. [...]It's probably not the camera for those that like having a lot of setting control but for someone that wants a good grab and go shooter, I think this is great.UPDATESince getting this, my Canon has gone to a better place. The Cyber-shot has become my one and only camera and has been impressing me at every turn! The super intelligent mode is absolutely amazing in what it can do.

I intend to use it for basically snapshots during vacations and general living. I have found that I like to take short video clips to add a little reality to the still pictures. For this reason I wanted the replacement camers to have good video capability. A careful inspection of various cameras shows that some do not have active focus during movies, while others use digital zoom after the shotting begins. Another big factor is the start-up time. Some very good cameras can take up to five seconds. This doesn't sound long, until you actually try using the camera. This Sony is almost instantaneous.  Although the majority of pictures I take are snapshots, I have a low tolerance for poor quality. Years ago I was serious photographer, preferring 2.25 inch format cameras. The results with the Sony TX-55 are all I need. The still photographs are sharp and the dim light performance is excellent. The Backlight function is especially useful.  The optical+ zoom works well out to the 10X as stated. The little nub control is different, but works.  There is a little discomfort with the form factor for a while. As others have stated, fingers can be a problem. I have tried many ways to hold it, but in the end, the standard, straightforward way is best and becomes comfortable. I think it is unlikely that the camera will be dropped. I also don't think there should be a problem smudging the lens if held and opened in a reasonable manner.  There are three things I don't like. One is using the wrist strap - it is on the wrong side. The second is the placement of the microphones - being in the top middle limits finger placement, probably leading to the many complaints about holding the camera. The holes should have been in the front. The third is that Sony should offer a shorter USB cable. The 1.4 meter cable, when wadded up, approaches the size of the camera itself in my laptop bag. There seems to be no alternative available to the Type3/USB provided.  The touch screen is excellent. Compared to my MacBook and iPod, I think it is really quite good. A short, sharp tap does the job reliably. The menus are simple, when necessary, but after initial setup, are not needed often.  I haven't used the camera long enough at one time to find the battery life a problem, but I can see this could be a problem for a lot of pictures. On the other hand, it charges quickly from my MacBook Air's battery, not taking much drain, and it charges rather quickly.  The movies are quite good. MP4 is better on the laptop as stated by Sony. The optical stabilization does a good job when you realize that rapid panning is annoying no matter how stable.  I would recomment the camera for its convenience and functionality. There are cheaper cameras, but the ones in this class are not too much different - especially if size is a consideration and the fact that if the camera battery dies, its nose isn't left hanging out.

In many ways the TX55 is a tiny marvel. When it came, I was excited that the look and feel were wonderful. I love the slide-down panel that covers the lens and flash. It make the camera feel secure, and the sliding action is smooth with a nice tactile bump at the end. The action is precise, like fine machinery. I didn't have any problem opening it, as some have said. Needs to be started from the middle.The IQ (image quality) looks very good. Although little is adjustable, the automatic modes appear to do a nice job, in daylight, low light, flash on/off etc. Color rendition was excellent. The noise reduction at higher isos was very nice too, compared to some I've seen. You'll never get noiseless pix with this size sensor, but the CMOS and the processing probably get close to the best you can get (combined with the Zeiss lens).The big 3.3\" OLED screen is impressive for brilliant colors and detail. Background defocus mode works nicely to simulate the shallow depth of field normally obtainable only with larger lenses (eg DSLR etc). However, one does have to be quite close to the foreground object for this to work--about 30cm or 12\" is recommended. Dynamic focus and many other features make this a very modern camera, although many bells and whistles are things I'd probably never use, like 3D and some of the picture effects. The \"clear image\" digital zoom actually does work quite well, bringing usable zoom to 10x, and is far better than the typically crappy digital zooms offered on most point-and-shoots.I found the manual controls (just on/off, shutter, and zoom) fine. For someone with big fingers, I suppose it would be a problem. After a few times of turning the camera off instead of the intended shutter press, I learned the trick. The zoom stick was fine for me.So why did I return it? I suppose part of it might be a defect, but it could also be a design flaw--and one that could have had several work-arounds that would have made it irrelevant.The touch screen is too darn sensitive. This has been mentioned by other reviewers, so it may be a design thing, but it was so irritating that for me, it was a defect. On a camera where the touch screen is a huge part of the user interface, I find it simply amazing that Sony didn't do a better job here.First of all, the screen was so sensitive that often things would happen with the finger hovering an eighth-inch above the surface. This could have been solved by including a sensitivity adjustment in the settings somewhere! Of course one couldn't operate the screen with gloves on, in the winter for example, but I'd have been willing to wear cut-off finger gloves for this otherwise marvelous camera. But the basic problem, is this:A big part of a digital camera, for me, is showing people pictures in the camera. The 3.3\" screen should be great for this. BUT, when you start reviewing pictures, there are all sorts of icons and readouts cluttering the screen--making the picture almost secondary. If you wait about 4 seconds, they go away. But 4 seconds is a long time when you're trying to show a picture to a friend, on the fly. Now after the icons go away, you can swipe to the next picture, and the next, without them coming on again. Which would be GREAT, except that if you tap the screen while swiping, the icons come back. And for me, 80% of the time a swipe turned included a tap in that small computer brain. So the next picture would come up, but it would again have all the icons, and you'd have to wait another 4 seconds for them to go away to see the darn picture! Unacceptable when trying to show off your recent accomplishments. Swipe--4 seconds to see it clearly. Swipe--4 seconds before it's clear. etc.Now maybe I just have a strong aura or something, but others tried it with similar results. Sony could have EASILY put a couple of things in there to make this problem moot, not counting a sensitivity adjustment. Among the icons are left and right arrows, which you can tap to make the previous/next picture come up. But they aren't there in the icon-free viewing mode! If Sony had left just tiny arrows you could tap, instead of swiping, then that would be an acceptable way to go through pictures without having all the other icons around. Another solution would be to have a mode to switch to that just didn't have any icons! Then you could swipe/tap to your heart's content, moving among the picture showing up on that big beautiful screen.Interestingly, there is an icon that, in shooting mode, does turn off the icons. But that same icon, in viewing mode, only turns on/off the exposure info, eg iso etc. All the other irritating icons remain!Another minor niggle is that in shooting mode, you only see the picture in a reduced format, not using the full screen. The icons are outside that area, but you don't really get full use of the screen for seeing your target. Also, even at max brightness, the screen is pretty weak in sunlight. It's not bad in just bright light, but it doesn't automatically adjust, so if you go from shooting outdoors, where you want the screen at max, then go indoors to look at pix, you have to navigate a few menus to turn the brightness down for pleasant viewing.I really did want to like the camera. I loved, or could live with, pretty much all of it EXCEPT the 4 second wait for icons to go away. I really really like the smallness of it combined with the big screen, and tried my best to imagine that I could live with the viewing problem. But in the end, I knew it would not work for me.

It seems to take very good pictures and is very capable in low light conditions as advertised...but, it could be SOOOOOO much better.First the GOOD:1) Size - unless your pants are painted on, the size is small enough to carry comfortably in just about any pocket. If small-size is not such a priority, I probably would recommend a slightly larger camera that can be handled more ergonomically.  My wife has a Sony DSC-T77, and it is truly more \"handle-able\".  However, I would never carry her T77 around all the time.2) Picture quality / capability - effortlessly nice.  Pictures taken with this camera are quite flattering in that they really make you look like you know what you are doing.The NOT so good:1) The Buttons -  There are only 3 on the camera; on/off, shutter release, & zoom, and all are very poorly executed...this is where some Apple-insight would have been VERY welcome. The shutter release, unfortunately, is by far the WORST. It almost sits sub-flush with the camera body and has very little stroke / undetectable detents.  If the camera didn't actually function, I would have guessed the shutter release button was broken and had collapsed into the camera.  Making matters worse is that the on/off button immediately adjacent (though seldom, if ever, used since the camera is turned on/off most conveniently opening/closing the lens cover) sits slightly higher than the shutter release AND has some detent/feedback in its stroke. Finally, completing the trio of the most poorly conceived button layout/execution ever is the unfortunate shape / size / location of the \"zoom\" button. The zoom sits to the right of the shutter release and is as uncomfortably \"High\" above the camera body as the shutter release is \"low\" into the camera body.  This compounds the shutter release button issues since your index finger is obstructed by this wart of a button while searching for something resembling a shutter release.  The shape of the zoom is a cylinder with sharp edges.  WHY?????  The two most often used buttons are in complete dis-harmony with one another.  This is truly the most infuriating thing about this camera and if it weren't for the \"good\" features, would be reason-enough to return this camera. It's really that bad.2) Touch screen - It's manageable, but as was pointed out in another review, sensitivity / usability is embarrassingly bad if you are used to the effortless and intuitive nature of any Apple touch-screen product. Since almost everything is controlled by the touch-screen, this doesn't seem acceptable.  Alone, it wouldn't keep me from purchasing the camera, but leaves me wishing for more.I really feel I'm being generous with 3 stars.  However, if the buttons were improved, it would easily be a \"4.5\".

Unfortunately, it has such a smooth surface on both sides that I have dropped it twice in perhaps fifteen uses.  I am not clumsy.  I have never dropped my cell phone.

Why the two?  - if I have to go out, would I want to take the TX55? IOW, is the TX55 worth the effort?1. The TX55 is smaller than the iPhone 4S and is almost too small. WAY smaller than my Sony TX7 and TX9 models. The TX55 screen shines and is much better than the TX9 but the iPhone 4S screen is also first rate with black levels and contrast - but is the iPhone 4S screen is bigger and MUCH MORE RESPONSIVE! The small icons on the TX55 are self-defeating = it takes a number of tries to hit the PLAY icons, for example. Sony STILL cannot get the touchscreen right, and since all but 3 of the \"buttons\" are icons, it is crucial to get it right. It isn't right. Worse, trying to scroll, etc is a joke. Advantage to iPhone 4S2. I always love the Sony HHT, panoramas, and Anti-Motion Blur. although the iPhone 4S is no slouch in the field of photo tricks. In low-light, advantage goes to Sony.3. The HDR on the iPhone 4S is WAY better than the fake-looking TX55 HDR mode (c'mon Sony, do it right!).4. The photo IQ is close, but the better sensor on the TX55 wins. However, in a pinch, I would be happy with the iPhone 4S. Nearly need to pixel-peep to see the differences. So, advantage Sony. Kinda.5. Zoom is great on the TX55 - even the fake-sounding \"extra\" optical extended zoom works well. Sony.6. Battery life - d'oh - here again, Sony kills itself. Battery life on the TX55 sucks. AND it is a different battery from all other Sony models. iPhone 4S wins here.7. Wide angle - Sony wins big over the iPhone 4S.8. Video - a biggie for families - and major reason I bought the TX55. ASTOUNDING video on the TX55. The iPhone 4S isn't bad, but it is no match for the TX55, and considering the optical TX55 zoom. Sony wins.9. Presentation, slideshows -  Sony doesn't even show up for this match. iPhone 4S by a mile.10. GPS - iPhone 4S all the way.11. Social interaction - IOW, can you immediately share online - are you kidding? iPhone 4S wins.12. Flash - you might think that the Sony would win this, but the iPhone 4S has the persistent video flashlight mode. Cool!  Gonna give this to iPhone 4S.13. Focus, exposure. Sony boots too many shots with OOF goofs. Ouch! With all my Sony's, its a given that one always focuses twice before shooting. Its that bad at times. The iPhone 4S has an app called \"Top Camera\" that is cool to use in that it allows one to drag a focus box AND a separate exposure box to anywhere on the screen, it essence. setting exposure and focus apart. Not easy to do on any P&S; camera. iPhone 4S wins here.Conclusion - it has gotten to the point that I need to really consider taking the TX55 with me every day. The iPhone 4S is just too much fun to use as a camera and video device. That being said, the TX55 is so small and thin, it makes it easy to grab and go (I only hope I don't leave these in my jeans during a wash...). The video quality alone does make the TX55 a serious consideration to take along. But in the end. if I forget the TX55, I don't usually fret. The iPhone 4S is that handy.", "Date": "December 1, 2011"}, {"Title": "Died after 2 months Junk", "Author": "Lisa Terrell", "ReviewID": "R3B25K1TSVEU9J", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I always wanted a nice pocket camera.  I figured it was a Sony it must be good.  Wrong! It always acted unpredictably, at first I thought it was because I did not know how to use it.  But then I realized it was very buggy.  The charging cord never fit in properly, you had to shake it to get it to charge. It finally died after 2 months.  I am trying to send it in for warranty repair.  But when I go to Sony's web page and click on warranty repair it gives me an error message.

Savoiu", "ReviewID": "R1DNUMFOKTVECS", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I thought I'd get this for my wife as a replacement of her aging Canon A720IS. After trying out the camera for a few weeks I think that it will not fit the bill.Let me start with the biggest let-down: ergonomics. The camera is too small and slick for its own good. First of all I don't like having to always slide down the front cover just to take a picture. And sliding it down is not that easy. You actually have to push down right on the top part of the cover otherwise, since the front of cover is smooth, your finger gets no traction. Secondly, the lens is too close to the upper left corner. You have to make sure that fingers don't get anywhere near the front upper left corner otherwise they will be in the picture.The touch screen has good resolution and colors but the touch part did not work as well as I expected. First, you have to make sure that you're not touching any part of the screen before touching any intended area. This means that you'll have to gingerly hold the camera just by the edges. When swiping to scroll it seems to do it by a random amount so you're never sure where you'll end up. Secondly either the user interface is not well tuned or the response time of the screen is too short. If you touch to dismiss a dialog box it immediately activates whatever button happened to be in the same spot but under the dialog box. Lastly, as far as manual controls of the exposure about the only thing that you can control is the ISO. Aperture and shutter speed do not appear to be user-controllable but metering mode and white balance can be manually controlled.Finally, the image quality. After reviewing the first few images I thought that I might be a bit too harsh given that my primary camera is a DSLR. But then I compared it to the old Canon A720IS and realized that, even though the Sony has twice the pixels, the overall image seems worse (even when down-scaled to Canon's 8MPix). I've added two images to the product gallery that show the areas where the Sony was lacking (although it might be hard to tell given the Amazon has reduced the image sizes). The main problem is that there appears to be image softening even at ISO100 due to heavy noise reduction. Makes you wonder why bother with 16MPix if they are no good.I have not tried many of the modes but I was intrigued by the panorama mode. However the results were quite mushy.All in all I'd say one would probably be better off using a modern cell phone camera (if only they had optical zoom).Edit: the USB cable that the camera comes with has an unusual (to me and I've seen a few) connector on the camera side. The other end is the typical full size USB connector. Be sure not to lose it.", "Date": "November 17, 2011"}, {"Title": "Sony DSC-TX55 and the replacement one.", "Author": "Ricardo A.

When it was first announced in the internet it was all positive reviews based soley from Sony's exaggerated claims with all the fanfares and fireworks. I'll have to admit that a few of the claims are true: Excellent on low light situations. Zooms really good. Focuses real fast. The lies: Grainy as hell. Quite small for a camera to handel compfortably. It focuses fast but out of focus most of the times. I think Sony made it too small. It would have been better if it was the size of an iPhone 4 or any current cellphones. Most pictures are grainy. I could almost bet that the new iPhone 4s will do much better even at 8 megapixels (quite ample  for high resolution pictures, anyway). The auto preview (after shooting, only lasts a second and then gone) I could not find the procedure from the camera setting menu on how to adjust it for longer showtime. \"let me see, let me see, oops it's gone\" situation here. I own a Nikon D7000 camera. I just can not be carrying it all the time on my shoulder and also it intimidates a lot of people especially in all casinos in LV and Indian casinos in California. I need a side-arm camera that can fit my shirt pocket that is why I purchased the TX55 plus the big claims (DSLR camera killer). The TX55 is almost invicible, as a matter of fact, I was in Morongo casino last night and I was taking pictures all over the place with flash. Nobody said anything including the security people. We were there to watch the Shanana show. We were seated in the front row. I was the only person shooting with flash. Nobody paid attention. I maybe demanding too much from this mediocare camera but they gave such a high expections the way it was introduced that was analogous to Jesus is coming. I am giving it 3 stars and that's being too generous.This a follow up: I just recieved the replacement TX55 from Amazon yesterday (10-15-2011) and did some reevaluations to be fair with Sony. The release button works a lot better now, but it is too deeply and still difficult to push. I am a bowler and my fingers have callus. They should have set the button higher by at least 1mm. The digital zoom is the major problem causing the low resolution. I completely disabled both the Clear Image Zoom and the Digital Zoom. It made a noticeable improvement. I am letting my wife have this camera. I will stick to my DSLR.
