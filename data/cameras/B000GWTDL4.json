{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Just a few technical notes.  Professional cable spool w/ power wires", "Author": "HMMWV \"God, Country, Corps\"", "ReviewID": "R242ULD9355BFE", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "My cable came with 18ga wire - that is not to say they all do - but I've seen other brands that ship with 22 or 24 ga wire.  The voltage drop on the tiny wires is really too much on a 12VDC system, thus I prefer the 18 ga design.You'll need a crimper and some BNC crimps like these Paladin 9730 RG59 BNC SealTite\u00ae Compression Connectors, 10-Pack which are designed for rg-59 cable diameter.  You'll also need the universal paladin crimp tool because the bnc is such a big connector compared to the catv F connector. Paladin 4910 SealTite Pro Compression Cable TV \"F\" Kit wi th KT 8, LC CST, Flaring Tool, SealTite Pro and 10 RG6/RG6Q in Zipper CaseThis cable spool came with two end pieces that allowed you to unreel from either direction (they suspended the spool above ground and made a bearing surface to spin on)considering the cable without the power wires siamesed sells locally at FRYS for $110 the package is a good deal in the $120 price range.  I've alreay used one spool and ordered a 2nd - my first one was black and I'll update the review if the 2nd comes any other color.  I must admit white is not what I would expect, but the extension cables with the q-see cameras are often white.", "Date": "December 24, 2008"}, {"Title": "Great price.", "Author": "Tomasz J. Dorosz \"TOM D\"", "ReviewID": "RY4JMNZ7UK6U5", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I have installed Home camera's for a while now and for some reason all the companies started to use cheap copper and decrease the diameter of the video cable.  The copper feels cheap and soft easy to bend.  The video cable as a whole is not as wide as other Q-see as I bought before.  Its not really a big deal but you better have some good quality connectors or they will be loose as a goose.  What can I say I was a fan of the thicker bigger insulation of the copper.  Don't bother with cheap packed cables and get what the pro's use and save yourself some money.", "Date": "October 26, 2009"}, {"Title": "Good wire", "Author": "454Malibu", "ReviewID": "RTA8O5VZT6PFL", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This cable seems to be pretty good quality.

I would recommend Swell brand over this because at the least the Swell brand has your copper grade graded shielding + an aluminum jacket over the core foam insulator providing an added layer of shielding.", "Date": "February 11, 2013"}, {"Title": "Good quality.

Brown \"GeeBee\"", "ReviewID": "RSZ6MK2MI41KB", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I purchased a roll of this Siamese cable approximately 5 years ago and used half the roll. A bit too stiff I thought but it did the job. A week ago I decided to add a few more CCTV cameras to our system and couldn't believe my eyes. The braid along the entire length of the coaxial cable had rusted and turned to dust. Yes...dust. The braid appears to be there, just brown in color, but it crumbles to dust as you touch it. Connectivity is zero. A local CCTV expert tells me the cable braid was probably primarily zinc and not copper so with time, corrosion will take place. The cable was stored indoors. Never knew cables had use by dates. Amazing. I have just had to dump 300 feet of cable.", "Date": "October 13, 2013"}, {"Title": "Good cable", "Author": "Digitx", "ReviewID": "RF9VE4K11FXAD", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "What can you say about cable other than it works and transmits a good signal for all my installs so far", "Date": "December 29, 2012"}, {"Title": "This is the good stuff", "Author": "theclient", "ReviewID": "R1A9DBOWRNPTAN", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I purchased a Q-See system and it came with the standard cables, they are not good quality one you can wiggle the BNC connector and the picture goes out.

The thickness of the conductor, shield and dielectric are just right for making BNC cables with good connections and reliable performance.  Effective procedures for making good BNC cables are not well documented.  There are many methods shown on YouTube but most leave out important details or don't work well.  You have to watch these YouTube methods and experiment to create your own that works well.  These cables allow you to do that.  I found that crimp tools and connectors work better than compression.", "Date": "March 13, 2012"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": "$101.99", "Features": "RG-59 coaxial video wire\n18 gauge copper wires for power supply\n500ft length", "Name": "Q-See QS59500 500 Feet Siamese Cable w/RG-59 & 2 Copperwires for Power (Colors may vary)", "ImgURL": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51epwxFyTzL._SY300_.jpg", "ProductID": "B000GWTDL4"}}
