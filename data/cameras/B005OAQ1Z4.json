I would like to see an off switch for when home and do not want it on  to save on electric billand I would like to see a cable lock conection like a lap top has to prevent any theff.I will update as I learn more about  but would say if your looking this is a very good start and the web set up no longer should be a factor so smile your on camera.", "Date": "April 5, 2012"}, {"Title": "Dose the JOB", "Author": "Krystalla27", "ReviewID": "R120ZONN6H7HN6", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "dose what is ment to work for.

I looked at a lot of other systems and read plenty of reviews before deciding on this system.  First of all, it's very affordable, arrived quickly, and can be installed relatively easy (depending on your access and installation locations).  If you think you will need more than 25' per camera, order additional wire to avoid having to go in the attic more than you need to.  The camera field of view is actually a lot tighter than I expected.  So, you may need to move your camera farther back to see a bigger area.I have not setup the DVR to my wifi connection yet.  But, have seen videos online as well as other users who have given clear instructions.I would recommend this as a basic camera system.  However, you may find yourself looking for improved/different cameras to better suit your needs.  I have added a 2nd output so the cameras can be viewed on my main (42\") TV.  It will require you to purchases some adapters (very cheap) but it's a nice feature too.Prosquick setupall needed items providedimage quality is acceptable (for the price)IR/night vision is acceptableDVR and camera settings are somewhat easy to figure outchoice of outputs (computer monitor or video out)Consimage quality lacks detail and it's difficulty to get true colorsset screw on brackets are cheap and will breakmotion are and sensitivity is a little difficult to set, however it's a great featureinstruction sheet is in micro print*see pictures for more info", "Date": "May 1, 2012"}, {"Title": "Good Value, Not a great system", "Author": "Bender bending", "ReviewID": "R3IAOWNHQBMV00", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "The Good:Price is very reasonableDaylight performance is outstanding, can see images from far off in surprising clarityThe Bad:In daylight the colors are distorted, for example green trees look purple, I am told that this is because the IR lights are operating even during daylight. This is as opposed to better cameras that automatically switch to night vision in black and white.Night vision is poor. It is acceptable when aimed in an area with some light. In total darkness you see nothing.The good news is that the setup is cheap enough that you can buy a better camera for the channels that really need it.The Ugly:The documentation is awful.The quick start sheet is printed in 4 point type in a light grey color on a white background. (really tough to read)The manual has a lot of information, but the English, if that is what you want to call it, is terrible. I was able to figure out how to set it up through my own basic knowledge and by reading the help on their website.FYI:When setting up the DVR to be used remotely you must publish four ports.(in port sharing on your router configuration)1. The HTTP  port2. The \"Command Port\" (5050)3. The Media Port (6050)4. The mobile port (7050) - If you are going to view from an Android device.", "Date": "September 4, 2012"}, {"Title": "Excellent basic camera kit and Excellent customer service.", "Author": "SouthernAmazoner", "ReviewID": "R2JV0YUFB6W35O", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "First I had some doubt about ordering this. I received it quickly and everything was as it was supposed to be.  Until now I had a wireless 2 camera system that didn't have recording capabilities.  I own a one story home in Florida (yes I DO know how to vote properly).  I mounted three cameras in front under the eaves and one in the back to cover the pool.  I had two problems.  One was a defective cable.  No big deal as I knew I would need one cable longer than the 60' and had already bought one.  Customer service sent me a replacement cable anyway and they didn't make me go through the hassle of returning the original. Second the manual and quick set up sheet was hard for me to understand.  It was too generic and tried to cover several different models.  It had a step in it for me to install a hard drive (not included)WHAT?  Turns out the hard drive was already installed.  It took me about a 1/2 day to get things working and positioned just the way I wanted.  Not bad for a 62 year old guy.  My wife did complain that it was taking too long to get \"the damn thing up\" but I don't think she was talking about the camera system.....I was amazed at how well the four images on my monitor looked. Very crisp. Not 3D but good, even the one with a 100' cable.  Bottom line is that if you're looking for a low priced reliable camera system for a small home don't hesitate to get this one.  BTW the price was one eighty five when I purchased it from Amazon about three weeks ago", "Date": "June 4, 2013"}, {"Title": "Great", "Author": "Freddievi", "ReviewID": "R18TQLJ1BPQ5CL", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "This item came as advertised.

I was sent the wrong cameras at first but they replaced them with no problem at all.  The 6mm lens cameras have a pretty good picture but a very narrow field of view.  The 3.6mm lens has about twice the view but the picture is a little more grainy.  Set up was pretty easy, except some hassle getting the local networking so i could view it on my computer.  And to view it remotely you need a computer with activex enabled which none have now because it is a security issue.  For the money it is worth the peace of mind knowing you have some kind of system, just don't expect top notch quality.", "Date": "August 22, 2012"}, {"Title": "Beware of Bait and Switch!!!", "Author": "Ticked Off", "ReviewID": "RHAQYD7P4SLXU", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "Please do not buy anything from EZoomTek!!  I ordered the ZMODO DVR security kit with 4 cameras.  When I opened the package, I had a note stating that I was given replacement cameras.  They stated that I was given better wiring for compensation for the replacement cameras.  I tried to wire up the kit, but I could not get the dvr to hook up to the cameras.
