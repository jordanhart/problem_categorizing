This adapter allowed me to keep my current 6-pin cameras in place and covert them to BNC right at the Lorex system without running any cable. Installation was a breeze and literally takes only a few minutes. Highly recommended.

It came on time! Next day delivery for 5 bucks when ordered on SUNDAY in Phoenix! I just can't believe the inflated price... But still priced lower than the rest.I'm a professional low-voltage contractor and my customer insisted that we utilize his cheaply made Lorex cameras for his commercial property despite the fact that half of them have already burnt out.So I need to integrate his Lorex cameras (which have 6-pin DIN connectors) into a professional brand DVR (Of course, only accepts BNC as an industry standard). I discover that I can only find these Lorex power adapters at a handful of stores. Thankfully, Amazon was one of them. Despite Amazon's high price on this item, it was lower than the rest of the online distributors.", "Date": "November 13, 2011"}, {"Title": "It works fine.", "Author": "B.", "ReviewID": "R1Y503VIACQU7S", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I used in my work with a Lorex cameras system to provide power the cameras.Works fine, no complaints.", "Date": "May 22, 2011"}, {"Title": "Useless", "Author": "Jerry", "ReviewID": "R1E6M8KMCNUG96", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I was told by a Lorex QA manager to purchase one of these for the system I have.
