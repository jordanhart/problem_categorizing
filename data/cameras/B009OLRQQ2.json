Crisp movies too! I wanted something inexpensive enough that I could take it sailing and other rough outdoor activities, and not be horrified if I lost it or damaged it, but still take great pictures. I had tried the Polariod digital camera in the same price point ($80) and it was horrible. I knew from that experience I had to have a fine lens (Wow - Leica!) and the option to chose flash on a button on the outside of the camera so I could quickly take flash photos (and not wait for a touch screen to eventually decide it could detect my finger!) I also knew I wanted a lithium battery for length of charge and a light weight camera (instead of heavy AA batteries.)Great camera! Only minor complaint - again consider what a great deal this is! - the battery door comes open too easily and fits a little loosely.I now carry this one with me all the time!", "Date": "July 3, 2013"}, {"Title": "More dependable lens than Canon", "Author": "Cobra Commander", "ReviewID": "R6GEU2BAONM0V", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "We owned the power shot sd1300 is before buying this one.The powershot lens proved to have a short life span and was easily damaged.Where as the Lumix FH6 has a far superior lex lens and widescreen features.", "Date": "March 29, 2013"}, {"Title": "No paper manual", "Author": "handyman \"Handyman\"", "ReviewID": "R12OYSK3VP4D2V", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "Great camera, but no paper manual, yes available online, but would be nice to have small handy printed copy.Good on batteries too bad they had to have a rechargeable that has to be taken out each cycle, while it comes with a usb cord that would have 5volts available to charge and take out pictures at the same time, other models do it, I overlooked that feature thinking a rechargeable would certainly be within the camera, not.", "Date": "May 30, 2013"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": null, "Features": null, "Name": null, "ImgURL": null, "ProductID": "B009OLRQQ2"}}
