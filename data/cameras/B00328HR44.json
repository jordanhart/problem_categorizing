Apparently it's a new generation. It is so automatic it makes it really easy to use. It automatically detects the photo type you are taking and lets you know - scenery, cuisine, closeup, etc. The smile feature is fun. Face detection with exposure correction really works. It's compact, boots up quickly and has little or no delay when taking a picture. The 12MB picture really captures detail. We love this camera but may buy another brand for my wife when the time comes just because I like to experiment.", "Date": "April 25, 2010"}, {"Title": "Great Value", "Author": "Jennifer", "ReviewID": "R6OQ8XPXTQOD6", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I have two other Sony Cyber-shot cameras that I am very happy with so when I needed an extra pocket-sized camera, it was a simple decision.  I really like the larger screen on this camera and the simplicity of the settings means less fussing and more point & shoot.  In fact, I found myself grabbing this camera more than my old Cyber-shot which has more features.I only had one issue in three weeks of frequent use.  There was a more noticeable delay sometimes when taking pictures and some pictures came out blurry.  This mostly occurred when I was taking photographs of stationary aircraft outside in full sunlight so I am not sure why it had difficulty finding the focal point.  I would retake the picture seconds later and it would focus just fine.  Our conclusion was that it might have been a low battery issue since we had to replace the batteries the next day.  However, the low battery indicator did not come on during these issues.", "Date": "May 11, 2010"}, {"Title": "Good price for a sleek one", "Author": "Partha", "ReviewID": "R1VNXW50Z8AZK5", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "This is a must have if you are a no-hassle camera lover.

I'm sure the lithium batteries are fine, but I like to have some extra batteries handy when shooting an event. The camera, like an earlier model Sony I have, is easy to use and well made, and I like the smaller size of the DSC-S2100. It will take movies as well, and the only thing I don't like about the camera is the location of the switch to select pictures or movies.

Harjo \"Spanish teacher\"", "ReviewID": "R17K6VHA9RFDVV", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "I love my Canon Powershot A-95, which takes really fabulous pictures, but it's also a little heavy for me to put in my backpack for Europe, so I found this at the local BX.  The good news: it's lightweight (6.5 oz with batteries) and slim, and will easily fit in a pocket.  It uses regular AA batteries--all the other light-weigh cameras only use rechargeable batteries, which means I would have to take along a (relatively)heavy recharger, thus defeating the purpose of buying the camera in the first place. Finally, it plugged right into my netbook and I uploaded pictures easily.On the downside, it only uses the Sony SD stick, and the pictures are soft. Not blurry (except when you zoom in on the picture), but certainly not crisp.  However, apparently all light-weight cameras have lousy picture quality, so it's a trade-off between weight and quality. Since my pictures will mostly appear on Facebook, I guess their being soft won't matter too much.If picture quality matters (e.g. you're going to make prints), you don't want this camera.  If you're going to use the pictures  on-line (blog or social-networking site), and weight is an issue, this is probably a good camera for you.

The price of this one is even lower than what I paid in 2004: plus I prefer the AA battery power feature: it makes replenishing the expired batteries that much more hassle-proof.Now that I have it, however, I see why the cost is lower than the $165.00 2004 price: no sound playback on the camera. Therefore, one doesn't get the benefit of testing volume levels. Hence, the -.5 on my rating. Otherwise it'd be a 5-star machine.The video playback on an HD pc is excellent: no graininess at all, smooth frame transitions (get a fast SD card: don't trip on a few dollars), excellent sound recording; it is very professional. The focus BEEP indicator is great when shooting; beep #1 on half-press lets one know they're in focus; press further and it's followed by another beep indicating one's press has triggered the shutter.The BONUS is what's built-into it; something never mentioned in the promos: 6 GB of native memory!

My wife wanted something cheap to replace 35mm film disposable cameras. I wanted a camera that used the same AA batteries as my Sony DSC-W5 and that did not employ a spare battery that costs $30 or more.The picture quality at 12M is inferior to that of my 4 1/2-year old Sony DSC-W5 at 1M. Pictures are not sharp. You can see this in 4x6 prints as well on a monitor. This is for pictures taken in the Intelligent Auto Adjustment mode both in daylight and indoors with the flash set to auto with the SteadyShot on and off. The 4x6 prints are comparable to that from a disposable 35mm film camera.You can set the focus mode in the menus which seems to help for some situations but you loose some of the automatic functions found in the Intelligent mode. Another annoyance is the Face Detection function is turned on each time you power up the camera. However, the lag between shots is minimal and the flash recharges quickly. I fiddled with other brand cameras in a few stores and some of these have considerable lag between shots.The camera consumes battery power fairly quickly. The battery indicator drops to about 1/2 after about 30 shots using rechargeable 2500 mAh NiMH batteries. The rated number of shots in the User Manual is based on using alkaline batteries. The DSC-W5 with new, fully-charged AA NiMH batteries will take several hundred shots.At least Sony has joined the 21st Century and you can now use SD/SDHC and Memory Stick DUO media in the camera.I have not used the Movie Mode so I cannot comment on this function.This camera lists for $110. The DSC-W5 was $350 when it first came out in 2005! You get what you pay for. But now we can go to any big box or drug store and make 4x6 prints for as little as 15 cents each. We can burn our own photo CDs.
