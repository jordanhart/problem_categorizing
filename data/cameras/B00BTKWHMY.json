Hard to beat for the amount of goodies you get. If you were buying this solely for the screen protectors and cleaning kit you may be a little disappointed.  The screen protectors are adhesive backed and the cleaning kit is inadequate to remove the sticky residue. It is still an excellent value without these, so I would buy again.  I chose one day shipping at checkout and had it in my hands in less than 24 hours.", "Date": "October 15, 2013"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": null, "Features": null, "Name": null, "ImgURL": null, "ProductID": "B00BTKWHMY"}}
