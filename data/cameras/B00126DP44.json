As we were planning on a lot of walking and packing very light, I wanted a pocket-sized camera. No way was I taking my old Pentax film SLR camera on this trip!There are many cameras out there that are similar in size and features to the Kodak M763, but most are more money. I have a general policy of not spending more than I have to for electronics, as whatever I buy will be obselete in a few years (witness my previous digital camera, only two and a half years old and positively outclassed by the M763 for only $10 more).I purchased this camera, and was VERY pleased with the pictures I took. It did everything I asked and expected from a pocket camera. Excellent clarity outdoors, with enough zoom capability to allow proper framing of the picture without having to move a great deal. Excellent low-light performance indoors allowing pictures in many circumstances without flash, which avoids the washed-out faces against a black background so common in flash pictures. Face recognition and image stabilization worked well, allowing quality pictures in light conditions I never expected to work.All in all I was extremely happy with my pictures and the ease of use of the Kodak M763, and never felt like I was missing out on features of more expensive cameras. I would heartily recommend it to anyone looking for a pocket snapshot camera.", "Date": "September 29, 2008"}, {"Title": "Great Camera, Great Price", "Author": "Theresa", "ReviewID": "R2EY9ST0F97B1J", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I wanted a digital camera easy to learn and use since this is my first digital.

I've had it a bit over a month, and have used it for a variety of situations, indoor and out. I have found it to be very easy to use. It has almost no lag, and can take pictures within a couple seconds of each other. The auto setting does a good job in just about every normal situation, but it has a large amount of custom settings if you need it.  It's lightweight, small, and you hardly notice it hanging from your wrist.  The battery lasts over two hours with almost continuous use.  However, it has a customizable power-saver feature that turns off the camera if you haven't used it for awhile.It has a movie-taking option, but I haven't used that yet.This camera does everything I need it to do.

She really liked it.  9 months after purchase, it would turn on, then immediately off.  The warranty covered it.  9 months after the repair, the same malfunction reoccurred, now out of warranty.  I spoke with customer service to discuss cost.  $70, or a 15% discount towards a new one.  I told him, point blank, no thanks, it's time for Canon.On a side note, I took a Colorado River raft trip in 1989, shooting Kodak slide film from the boat.  I'd shot slides for years, almost all Kodak, and used their pre-paid mailers for developing.  One of these precious river rolls was somehow developed concurrently with someone else's slide roll, essentially double exposing mine and theirs, ruining the roll.  I wrote Kodak, just looking for the barest apology, maybe a free roll, but received nothing.

First the positives:  easy to use (just monkey around with it, and you will get it even if you are a tech-dummy like me) and is lightweight portable.  Now the negatives:  very slow to snap pictures if you shake much (even with the image stabilizer), really needs light to work well (awful for indoor shooting), picture quality is horrible, video is quite sub-par.  I am no techie and cannot go into further details, but I like good quality photos.  This camera does not do it for me at all.  I was given kodak as gift and i only use it to take pictures to sell at ebay.  This camera even gives me a hard time doing that!!!  I have to snap 3-5 times for one picture to come out 'decent' as I am fussy how a picture will look like---if you are ebay seller you know pics make the difference in how well your product will sell.I plan to get a upscale camera sometime this year with my saved up sb.

Of course, they aren't going to be as great as those taken by an expensive \"professional\" camera, but for a simple point-and-shoot, I've gotten some fantastic pictures!  It did \"forget the date\" once and was dating some of my pictures for Nov. 2030. Once I realized it, though, it was an easy fix. No big deal.

Kodak easily stole a page out of Canon's book with the overall look and design. However, they failed to match the picture quality, even the video format.The camera says it will deliver digital photos with up to 7.2 mp resolution, but the pictures I shot had quality comparable to my old 5mp camera. If you're looking for razor sharp images, this is not the camera for you.The buttons on this camera pretty awkward. There is a wheel on the top of camera that you must carefully turn in order to change from photo mode to video mode. But there about 8 options on the wheel you have to be very careful or else you'll easily end up in the wrong mode. The push buttons on the camera are at surface level, they're not slightly elevated for easy access, this makes the buttons hard to feel and even tougher to push.My biggest problem with this camera, however, is the FACT that it only shoot video in Quicktime format. This is terribly disappointing, because Quicktime files cannot be edited or played on Windows Media Player, and you have to go out and purchase extra Quicktime software if you want to do anything with the videos.Personally the photo quality wasn't too big of a deal, and I could get used to the buttons. Its because of the Quicktime video format that I seriously dislike this camera and won't keep it. I could have bought a much better camera for 130$ The look is what got me, and Kodak never mentions Quicktime in their ads, so I was completely fooled when I bought this camera.130$ wasted, I swear to never buy another Kodak product for the rest of my life.
