{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Surprised by feature-laden camera!", "Author": "Oji John \"Oji\"", "ReviewID": "R2PLAL1S1G935O", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Yes, feature-laden camera the size of the palm of my hand.  We've been agonizing over which of today's modern home security cameras we could purchase to replace the old VEOs we've used for years.We read an article in a magazine which mentioned Sharx as a possible solution, so we decided to take a look at its website.We were encouraged enough to order one of the Sharx SCN2607W indoor cameras.  After trying it out for a spell, we can relate what we like about it:-> Manual = well-written.  Kudos to the tech writer!-> We can set up a camera using LINUX which is our primary operating system at home.  Yes, we can use a Mac or a PC, too.-> We can use the camera's wireless functions or we can hook the camera directly to our home CAT5/6 network. We tried both and had no problems.-> We can have images emailed to our ISP email account (e.g. Yahoo! or Gmail).-> We can monitor the camera with our Smartphone, Touch or any browser at any internet cafe in the world (where politics allow it ;-).-> If we want to archive images/video, we can use a computer already on the home network to receive files for storage.  We *don't* need a separate digital video recorder (DVR) or network-attached storage (NAS) as part of a package to store images or video files generated by the camera.-> OR, we can insert a MicroSD card which the camera will manage for us by overwriting the oldest file if the card is about full.  If we don't want to lose a file from the card, we can ask the camera to send the files to whatever storage device we're using on the home network.-> If you know how to set one up, your home network storage device can be an ftp or http server.  Maybe you already subscribe to an ISP that lets you ftp or http files to remote storage.  You can send your files there.-> The point of much of the above is: maybe you already have the basics of home security video monitoring - you just lack a good camera.  This is an excellent camera!-> The built-in motion detector works fine.  We can adjust the sensitivity and threshold with Firefox running on LINUX but an ActiveX add-on for IE7 provides an additional GUI flourish that's nice to have.-> Video resolution, frame rate, etc., are adjustable.  Various streams are available from the camera to suit different viewing/receiving/storage devices.  For instance, there's a stream available that's suitable for a mobile phone. (This feature we have not tried yet. . .)-> The IR LEDs light up a large room at night.-> The camera comes with a mounting bracket that you don't have to mount.  Just set it on a shelf and it won't fall over!  Don't like where you put it the first time?  Pick it up and move it (which illustrates one of the advantages of the WiFi feature!)-> Sharx' *outdoor* cameras have an additional interface that can send/receive triggering signals to/from professionally installed security systems (e.g. window breaking sensors, perimeter intrusion, etc.)That's all we've had time to investigate in one evening.  There are more features we'd like to investigate, but we're impressed by the camera so far.  We've decided this is our solution and will order more of the cameras.", "Date": "August 6, 2010"}, {"Title": "Customer support, set-up issues and limitations of use", "Author": "John Haldeman", "ReviewID": "R3NIRNX6QBVF9Z", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "First, in a phone call, SHARX assured me that the VIPcella-IR SCNC2607W has the same technical specifications as the VIPcella-IR SCNC2607 except that one is black and the other is white.  The only difference with the other model (VIPcella SCNC2606) is that the 2606 models do not have infrared lights for night vision.  The rest of the electronics, set-up etc are all identical.  Therefore, virtually all of the customer comments made about the other SHARX cameras apply to this camera as well.My initial problem with purchasing from SHARX was the very poor website.  As of August 30, 2010, there was no contact phone number, no manual to download, no specific technical information, no help with set-up issues.  Just an e-mail.  This bothered me as it did not inspire confidence that the vendor will provide adequate support for the product.  This concern was proven wrong. As mentioned by others, in spite of the poor web site, the actual customer support is outstanding.I received a shipment that was incomplete, I emailed SHARX customer support and within a few hours someone called me back, worked out the problem and then stayed on line patiently for over an hour to help me set up the camera till I was satisfied.I learned a lot about the set-up process during that one hour interaction.  Basically, from the cable modem, I connect to a router and one of the router ports connects further into an Apple Airport Extreme WiFi station.  If my router and WiFi station would have been the latest models with all the new automatic features  (such as UPNP), the camera would have set itself up almost without any sophisticated user interaction.  In my case, the router was from 2005 (Ancient stuff as far as computer equipment is concerned), and my Apple WiFi station was an older model for which no further firmware upgrades were available.Because of this situation, set up of the camera was a quite complex. Without help from someone knowledgeable in networking, it would have been impossible for even a relatively experienced computer user to get this camera (or any other camera) to work. The SHARX technical representative knew exactly what he was doing and got me through this process with great skill and with a helpful and patient attitude.  It was actually a pleasure to work with this person on the set-up.This experience solved one of the great puzzles in my mind:  How come that some people reported that set up was easy while others reported such frustrating experiences and couldn't get it to work?  I think the answer is that there is nothing wrong with the camera - the problem is that the more outdated and unusual the individual cable modem and router configurations are, the more difficult it will be to set up the camera.In summary, once the camera was up, it performed exactly as advertised.  I love the ease of using the many features of the camera, the manual is very well written, and the camera provides relatively good images AT CLOSE RANGE.HOWEVER, there is a limitation:  This is NOT a professional security camera.  In case of a break-in, for example, the video and images produced by the camera will most probably NOT allow police to identify the intruder based on facial recognition unless the intruder directly looks into the camera at close range. If the subject moves fast or is more than 3 yards from the camera, the image will be rather blurry.  Further, all WiFi equipment can be rendered useless by a WiFi jammer that is readily available to potential intruders. In short, this is a great product to watch the baby or the cleaning lady, but it is not designed to be a robust home security system.", "Date": "September 14, 2010"}, {"Title": "Pink Grass Pink Trees Pink Shrubs", "Author": "MM", "ReviewID": "R17B1YNNU7UYHX", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "Everything is great about this camera except one thing.  The color rendering is terrible.  Due to its missing an ICR filter, my entire garden of green grass and trees becomes pink with this camera.  A person wearing a blue shirt, black pants, and black shoes appears uniformly a pastel purple.  Absolutely useless for providing suspect identification in a security application.  The worst part about this camera is the documentation that does not admit to this color rendering failure until page 20 in the manual.  Perhaps this nugget of information should be in bold type, upfront, before the sale.  Needless to say, I returned the camera the next day.  The rule of thumb is, if a camera has IR illuminators, make sure it has an automatic mechanical ICR filter.", "Date": "December 21, 2010"}, {"Title": "Excellent do-it-yourself security", "Author": "Horatio", "ReviewID": "R3D035YB27GE7W", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Great camera and easy to use, but even if you run into troubles, the manual and the Sharx e-mail service is fantastic.  It's nice to be able to talk to someone who is so knowledgeable about their product.  The manual is well-written, very in-depth and it really helps when trying out all of the features.  I ran into one question about my network (not about the camera), and the Sharx tech-support people walked me right through it via email.With regard to the camera, it works well, but due to the IR capabilities, the colors are off a little bit. That doesn't bother me too much because I'm looking for good, clear security camera images.

MacInnis \"Mac\"", "ReviewID": "R2NCH330BUV17H", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "After reviewing numerous security cameras to an exhausting end, I selected this one.  It isn't the least expensive by any means.  But I wanted a camera that would record a video stream to a NAS (network storage), had excellent night vision, would send email alerts complete with photos of what it was seeing, and I could remotely control it via the internet from anywhere.  I don't use a 3G or 4G phone, but it will also send photos to these devices if programmed to do so.  From a computer knowledge perspective, I consider myself to be in the upper 1/3 of people that know what they are doing and with that said, setting up this camera can be just a little more difficult than average.  The plus side is that I made telephone contact with their tech person via the phone number provided and the one problem I had was solved inside of 15 seconds.  If I had to do this all over again, I wouldn't choose anything less than this Sharx Security camera.

Following the book was not easy going in, BUT tech support emailed AND called me to resolve my setup issues each time I ran into something new.  My dog has little time to live and it was important to me to get the camera up and running, and accessible anywhere from my iPhone to keep an \"eye\" on him.  I have not been able to access sound.  The live video quality is okay, and the snapshots taken by motion detection are okay -- not \"digital-camera\" quality, but good enough to see who, what, where.

This review is for all of them. The cameras work as advertised and I can describe them all as AMAZING products. I'm not a tech savvy, but I followed the well written manual until I got them all working without a hitch, utilizing almost every single feature including saving to a NAS drive. Their incredible customer service is a different story. I had issues at first saving to my NAS drive, because of the way I set up my NAS, not because of the cameras, but Sharx customer service walked me through the NAS set up and the problems were solved. Never told me contact the NAS drive manufacturer.

Whenever I visit the US for business meetings, I make sure I browse Amazon.com before my trip. I am always interested to see if there are new electronic gadgets being sold. Since some of the new items are not available for shipping to locations outside of the US, I normally have them shipped to the hotel where I stay.In my last trip to the US in Aug'10, I found this item \"Sharx Security VIPcella-IR SCNC2607W Wifi Wireless IP Network Camera.\" After reading the product features and the available review (I remember there was only one then), I decided to purchase the item. It was delivered on time to the hotel where I stayed and I brought it back home.Now I have installed this gadget in my home in the Philippines. It was very easy to install as long as you follow the instructions in the user manual. There is always a solution to any problem that may come up during the installation. For my installation, it was a breeze though as I read the user manual first. This gadget comes with an international voltage AC adapter (110V-240V) so I do not have to use a voltage transformer and I do not have to worry about accidentally damaging the unit in case I plug it in the wrong power outlet (both China & Philippines have 220-240V power supply).After the initial installation and when the wireless mode is already in operation, I accessed it using the assigned internet URL and, lo and behold, there was my living room and main gate and main door \"live\" on video. The unit also picks up sounds and you could hear conversations of people in the area. Pictures and videos are clear and the audio quality is very good. The night vision mode also works well. There are other features but you can try them later after the initial installation.So now even if I work in China, I can monitor my home in the Philippines and see what is happening there 24 hours a day, 7 days a week.
