{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Similar to the Z30, but better for one reason", "Author": "Yarii", "ReviewID": "RMHYFZQLZ79MK", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I love Fuji cameras - and no, I'm not a Fuji employee, but maybe I should be - I would love an employee discount!  This Z37 was a deal I couldn't refuse and I believe this is my 10th Fuji digital camera I've purchased since 2004.  I got the purple color and it's beautiful.I owned the Z30 Fujifilm FinePix Z30 10 MP Digital Camera with 3x Optical Zoom and 2.7 inch LCD (Whirl White) previously, but at the last minute I decided to gift it to a young relative of mine only because of one thing I disliked about it: On the Z30 the USB plug-in was located INSIDE the camera's battery compartment.  I feared the latch would eventually break off since the USB plug, the battery and the memory card were all in the same area.Instead, the Z37 Fuji has the USB plug on the SIDE of the camera.  In addition, this is a multi-use plug.  With the Z37 you get an AC adapter cable in addition to the USB cable.  The AC adapter charges the battery inside the camera.  So unless I'm removing the memory card on this camera, there is no reason to open the battery compartment.The AC adapter replaces the separate battery charger that comes with the Z30.  This also means if your battery runs low, you can use the Z37 with it plugged into an outlet, but of course, this does limit what you can take a picture of, unless it's something near the electric outlet.The Z37 is slightly thinner than the Z30 but otherwise they appear to be the same.  Same LCD size, and the buttons are located in the same configuration.  The LCD is big and bright - I have no trouble seeing anything outside in the bright sun. It's tiny and lightweight and easy to carry in either a pocket or small bag - it weighs slightly over 4 ounces.And since the lens has a cover - and this is the way the camera is powered on/off - by sliding the lens cover open (like the first Fuji digital cameras invented) you almost don't need to buy a separate case....although I do keep mine in a case because I don't like the exterior to get scratched.Just one complaint with this camera, otherwise it's perfect.  There is no good area to hold onto the camera. The entire back is composed of LCD screen and buttons. At least the back area is rubberized so it does help with the grip.But the pro's way outnumber my single complaint:>>> Quick response when opening the lens cover to take the first shot>>> SR Auto - just point and shoot>>> Takes beautiful pictures>>> Fast response time after taking a flash picture>>> Lithium-ion battery - one charge lasts over 200 pictures>>> Takes good videos - better than my expensive Panasonic LumixNote about the videos:  You can't use optical zoom once you start filming, but you can set it before.  You can use digital zoom after you start filming, but you have to turn it on before-hand in the set-up menu.  They aren't HD but they look pretty good.Note about the SR Auto setting:  This setting drains the battery a little quicker, because the lens and sensor is constantly evaluating and focusing whatever you have the camera pointed at - the lens noise is completely normal and nothing to worry about.  If you don't want to hear the lens focusing, just set the camera on regular Auto instead (the picture of the camera icon).In conclusion: This is a good entry-level camera and I recommend it for just about anyone who is looking for an easy to use camera.  Even a young kid. And it's built tougher than it appears - since the lens zooms INSIDE the camera body. Case in point: Two days after I received my Z30, it slipped out of my hands and hit the kitchen floor (my condo is built on a slab). I thought the camera was broken, but I turned it back on and was none worse for the wear. Not even a scratch.  This Z37 appears to be built just as tough as the Z30 which I dropped.It comes with just 18 MB of internal memory, so pick up an SD card if you don't already have one.", "Date": "May 10, 2010"}, {"Title": "Great", "Author": "Mercy Lopez \"yadi\"", "ReviewID": "R1LNGKYHMYZXMU", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This camera is small enough to carry everywhere and it gets better!

The lens remains protected and does not protrude out when the camera is turned on, a great feature for a 7-year old who is apt to drop or bump the camera at some time in the future. The Finepix Z37 is VERY simple to use and I would highly recommend to anyone who does not want to sift through all the complicated features and buttons of a pricier camera. The charging process is simpler than most, the cable just attaches to the camera, no separate battery charger needed and the battery does not need to be removed from the camera to be charged.

The camera uses a format that can easily be uploaded to the internet (which my old Vivitar did not).If I want to take a picture, I simply slide the cover open, look into the nice large screen, and snap.I love the automatic features - I am usually taking pictures of my foster dogs for the shelter website, and, of course, they tend to move when I snap the picture.  This camera captures them anyway, and adjusts the color nicely regardless of the light.I do have the manual for this camera, but I havent even needed it yet.

First of all, it's the perfect size and is very user friendly.  It takes very clear close-up shots and works well in daylight.  However, allow me to outline some of the drawbacks.1. The glare on the screen is so bad that it's nearly impossible to see in sunlight.  Also, I've noticed that pictures which look very blurry on the screen tend to show up clear on my computer, so the viewing screen leaves a little to be desired.2. This camera does not take pictures at night.  There is a night setting on the camera, and I had a Canon that took great night pics, so I was really disappointed that this one doesn't work at all on the night setting.3. In very bright sunlight, the corners of the picture will look dark because of the reflection.  In other words the lens is placed inside the casing just enough that there is a shadow on the corners of a picture when the sun is very bright.  This has happened without fail on all my beach pics with this camera.4. I'm not sure if this is user error or not, but when the SD card is reformatted, the file names go back to 0001.  So when I import the pics from the camera into iPhoto, half the pics in iPhoto have the same file name which is a huge pain when I'm transferring them to folders later on.  I never had this problem with my Canon, so this was another feature I was disappointed with.All in all, this is a nice little $69.99 camera.  However, were I making the choice again, I probably would have saved my money and invested in something of a little higher quality with more desirable features.", "Date": "July 26, 2010"}, {"Title": "Fujifilm finepix - not really new", "Author": "Goldengirl", "ReviewID": "R6FOMGALAX3M2", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "Fuji Finepix was marked \"NEW\" & marketed as \"NEW\".

Digital camera's are just one of those things that if you don't read reviews and compare, you may end up with something... crappy. Well I ended up buying this lil guy and I adore it!There are plenty of picture modes, and you really should go through them. I recently used the party mode for Halloween in a very dark room, and the pictures are clear and bright! You also have to learn what each mode is capable of in order to get the picture to be crisp and clear. Without the right mode you do end up with a blurry photo.The Macro is magnificent but make sure the object is really tiny since this baby can take really good shots of tiny details without it. The autofocus is very helpful too, but don't let go of that button until it's stopped focusing!You can't be mad at the rechargeable battery. It's another big reason why I chose this one. Most camera's with disposable batteries just don't have a long life. This rechargeable battery can laaaast. I can't really say how long, but I will say that after a night of shooting pics, I didn't have to recharge until the 3rd time I used it...I only have two complaints. The first is the actual buttons. They are really soft, and even though I haven't had any problems yet, I'm a bit scared that I won't be able to push them in the future. Think remote control buttons... The second is the on/off which is just a sliding door. It's not so bad, but if you slide it into your pocket the wrong way it does turn on. Atleast it does have an automatic shut off feature if you haven't pressed any buttons...All in all, I do like this camera.

I was in need of one after breaking my third Sony T-series in a row. I just wanted something that could take pictures of decent quality and could record video. I bought it at a military store so it came with a bundle including a memory card, reader and a soft case.PROsThere's two main things that this camera surprised me on:- The specs it has for such a small amount ($$$) is surprising. I'm used to paying greater amounts for less with Sony. I'm a big Sony fan. Or was...- I'm not big on portability as a main sell point, I'll sacrifice space if it pays off with quality and with results. However, this tiny camera fits in the palm of my hand and weighs a very small amount. And was definitely a great addition to the already surprising specifications.CONs- Much like the other review that offered a 1 star I too had a problem with the shutter speed and flash delay. Something that is a small inconvenience and/or can be fixed if you go through the options of the camera instead of giving up on it. I changed the settings and it's good now. And by doing so I now know the inner menus of the camera a whole lot better.- The battery sliding lid seems to be a little too loose for my taste. However, it might be my specific camera and not the model. Just a small incovenience.OVERALLGreat camera that packs a punch for what you pay.
