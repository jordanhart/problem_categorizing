{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Perfect second camera for hobbyists", "Author": "Man in the Middle \"strasma\"", "ReviewID": "R1HFX60LAMVV5O", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I've already been the happy owner of a Sony DSC-F828 \"big\" camera for over a year, and still consider it perfect for my serious photographic needs.However, precisely _because_ it is so big, it can be very inconvenient to bring along, and also very intimidating to potential picture subjects.Enter the new Sony DSC-T7. I didn't realize just how _much_ smaller, or more precisely, how much thinner it is than all other digital cameras until I saw it in person. It not only fits in a shirt pocket, it fits in a shirt pocket _along_with_ a Treo or an iPod. Because its 3x zoom lens is folded, it does not protrude at all when taking pictures, meaning most subjects won't even realize a camera is pointed at them, let alone that it is zoomed in and high resolution. This greatly easy getting natural expressions in informal photos.Next, the specifications of the T7 are better than those of other  similar Sony cameras such as the T1 and T33 in ways I care about, such as doubling the number of pixels in the 2.5\" LCD screen, including an auto-focus assist lamp, and USB 2.0 support without needing driver software when used with Windows XP.One of my pet peeves about digital cameras is that they are not protected from the elements. The T7 helps this in two ways. First, its on/off switch is a solid lens cover. Second, the camera fits easily in the smallest size zip-loc sandwich bag, and can easily be operated while in the bag, providing serious dust and splash protection.One further protection is needed, but easily handled. The LCD needs protection, which I provided by covering it with a sheet of screen protector plastic left over from an old PDA.As you might expect from such a thin device, battery life is somewhat limited (about an hour of continuous use, set up for maximum brightness, continuous focus adjustment, and automatic flash. For that reason, I bought a spare battery, and since the charger is bigger than the camera, suggest other buyers do the same.Similarly, plan on getting more memory immediately. The supplied 32M is good for only 14 pictures at top resolution. I settled for 512M, the largest I could actually buy at time of purchase, but would recommend the new 1GB size if available to you as you buy.  The memory door appears a bit flimsy, so it seems best not to need to open it too often.I bought this for my point and shoot wife to take on a week-long trip, and thereafter to have it with us whenever a shot might present itself, but not surely enough to carry the large camera, or in situations where keeping the large camera clean and dry might be an issue.If you too are a serious hobbyist, do be aware of unavoidable limitations: 1) 5MP is good, but not as good as the 7MP of a few also (barely) pocketable cameras. I decided smaller size outweighed higher resolution, but you may feel differently. 2) F4 is 2 full stops dimmer than the F2 of my other camera, which matters quite a bit when the light is low, as does 3) the ASA maximum of 400, rather than 800. There's also 4) no place to attach a filter. For a second camera, these are all perfectly acceptable compromises, in my opinion.Highly recommended as a second camera for hobbyists, or as a first camera for folks who want a very convenient and very high quality point and shoot camera.", "Date": "May 22, 2005"}, {"Title": "Joggably tiny and great camera!", "Author": "Steve M. Potter", "ReviewID": "R1HOIAM6SIYBXE", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "My main criterion for my 2nd digital camera was: can I jog with it in my pocket? Of all the 5mp+ I looked at, this is the only one that really won't be annoying. And has now been tested on several jogs with great success.  It is very solid, sturdy, and dense. It really is as wide and high as a credit card, and LESS than a cm thick, not counting the sturdy lens cover.  That cover was a big selling feature for me, as I am afraid of those flimsy metal leaves that close to 'protect' some lenses, while in my pocket. Although it has slid open by itself in my pocket, but the auto-off protected its battery.After 3 weeks, I have taken many great photos with it.  It has an amazing macro capability: better than 1:1! It really is like a magnifier, the icon they use for that mode.I miss the time-lapse feature of my Canon S50 (\"intervalometer\") and hope Sony gets a firmware upgrade to include that. Although this is not a full 'manual' camera, it has many adjustable features, and seems to choose well when you let its AI do the adjusting. The video is awesome, esp. at full res (640x480) as is the sound. In fact, you could set it to low res, just to use it as a sound recorder-- well over an hour on my 512M stick. At high res, you get only ~10 min on a gig stick, but considering this is not a camcorder, that is fine for capturing many moving 'images'.I LOVE the very fast start-up, well less than 1 sec.  Great for catching those spontaneous shots while riding in a car. And it is quiet: no motors whining to give away your photographic intensions.  (The zoom motor is virutally inaudible).I was very pleasantly surprised how intuitive all the buttons are laid out, and menus too.  Sony did a lot of usability testing.  Much better than my Canon. And the buttons are the sturdiest of its class of tiny cams.It has a tiny tripod hole, so needs their adaptor/desk-stand to mount (included). Battery is tiny but not as feeble as some reviews reported. I love Sony's 'infolithium' that tell you how many minutes you have left.  Get an extra, tho. The screen is awesome, and can be booped up for easy view in broad daylight. Who needs a viewfinder?Sensitivity and noise are pretty good-night images possible.  Image colors are over the top, so I turned down the 'saturation' setting.It is so tiny, you better use that long neck strap so you don't lose it. I keep it tied to my belt loop and forget I have it with me at all times now.If you want the best really small digital camera out now (May 2005) then this is the one.", "Date": "May 30, 2005"}, {"Title": "Impressed by image quality, and great indoor outdoor images.", "Author": null, "ReviewID": "R1CYF0O8Y7PT6K", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I am utterly impressed by this camera. Ill explain this review in 3 parts, the overall quality, and its uses.Indoor ImagesMany people complain about indoor images and I must admit i at first when purchasd this camera was very dissappointed at the orange brownish tinge from this camera, but i also discovered something new after a few days of owning this digital camera. Well the thing that really causees the brownish tinge in this camera is the type of flash thingy. If you are using this camera in low light conditions indoor, try using auto flash, as and it will have no brownish tinge, i have tested this many times and can confirm this, and when taking images in a fully lit area, use SLOW SYNCRO FLASH, this flash makes the color so accurate that you can't possibly see any oragne tinge. i compared it with auto flash and what a difference it made. When i mean dark areas for auto flash also I don't mean like complete black. Ill show you an example. Lets say ur in a room and half of it is lit, or the light source doesnt reach the whole room, like half the room is darker, than on the darker side use auto flash, and on the brighter side use slow syncro flash. It has high color accuracy, u just have to be steady. When taking pictures in complete darkness, the flash shows no significant difference. Also with the flash indoors, the book does show the distance, i know tons of people have not followed the distance and get overexposed pictures and complain its the cameras fault when its not. I think the distance for flash on the W side, normal is 3 and a half feet up to 8 feet something.After i followed these simple rules, i never had a brownish tinge in my images, and some of these pictures i tested were used using floursecent lighting, and some with natural light.OutdoorOutdoor images turn great in auto mode, no really need to set anything unless you want to take landscapes, they have settings for those already. Amazing quality, and if your taking pictures of people being being lighted from behind, try raising the ev a little higher, and use force flash.OverallGreat, compact camera. The images is what a 5 megapixel camera should have, i don't see why people complain about is to much. Sure its fine to complain to sony that the manual didn't show them how to take indoor images and how to use the slow syncro options. All my tests were done in the auto setting with only changes in flash, because the auto wb are already good. This camera is simply amazing, and is good for students/adults that just take pictures for family vacations, school projects. The price is also perfect for a camera this small and i do not complain about the battery life. And easy to use for just a point and shoot as you dont really need to change the settings. Hope this helps those that are deciding to get this camera or having trouble taking indoor images.", "Date": "August 18, 2005"}, {"Title": "Just another great camera from Sony", "Author": "Hi-Tech", "ReviewID": "RB7O6SM7E1E1G", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I had this camera for several weeks now and took over 100 pictures. The pictures are really good with this size of camera. People who complaint abut the picture quality of this camera either they expect too much from Sony or they never use an ULTRA-COMPACT camera before. You cannot compare this camera to the bigger (compact) camera from Canon, Nikon or Pentax. The depth of this camera is about half of the Canon SD lines (ex. SD400)  and Pentax S5i OR 1/3 of the Canon S lines (ex. S410).I currently own both Sony F828 (8MP) and Pentax S5i (5MP). I get this camera because it's thinner and has a larger LCD screen than the Pentax .Of cause, the picture quality cannot compare to  a semi-pro camera like Sony F828 but it's about the same as or better than Pentax S5i. This camera is great to take outdoor pictures or indoor pictures with short distance (under 5 feet). You cannot use this camera to take group photos (say- more than 4 people) because the flash is not strong enough to produce a good picture. Some people complaint about the noise but all they need to do is to lower the ISO to 200 or below to avoid those noises.I did not notice much about blurry pictures. The pictures come out great 90% of the time for indoor. Outdoor pictures are always great. Color is very decent also.Pros:1. Small - easiest to carry and decent picture quality2. looks great3. high quality built and feel great to hold4. battery is very decent compare to my Pentax5. histogram6. very good movie resolution with no time limit.Cons:1. add a charging station so that the battery does not have to come out when charging2. a little bigger and stronger flash is good3. a little bit pricy but built quality is great compare to my Canon or Pentax. Hey, why people are willing to pay more $$$ for an entry level Lexus when they can get an Avalon or a Camry with same options for thousands less.if you're looking for a camera to fit all situations (day, night, group photos), you need to get a BIGGER cameras but it's more difficult to carry around.

Chan", "ReviewID": "R1Z0S23ZCIZ3S1", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "I was looking for a ultraslim camera to replace my 2 years old Canon S400 which is still too thick and heavy for me as a snapshot camera.  When I first saw the T7, I was attracted to its super sexy style.  So the T7 automatically sit on top of my short list for the next camera.  (the others are Panasonic FX7, Canon SD400 and Nikon S1)  Before I made the decision, I have read a lot of reviews online regarding the T7, people are either love it or hate it, and I understand why soon after I got my hands on the it...I purchased the Sony T7 from a local store (although Amazon offer a better price, it would be a huge hassle if I don't like it and decide to return it).  But soon after taking a few pictures with the camera, I discover that this is definitely not a camera for me.For those people who highly rated this camera, those are the people who love sexy and stylish gadgets, in this category, T7 should be a perfect choice.  It is super stylish, slimmer than anyone could imagine for a 5MP camera and it is definitely an eye-catcher and a head turner that people just can't keep their eyes off it!However, after I calm down from it's stunning appearance and start using it, I immediately realize the reasons why so many users of T7 left negative feedbacks.  The camera is too small that it is awkward to hold and take pictures steadily.  Lens and the large LCD screen are prone to the fingerprints.  All of the pictures took indoor is grainy and noisy, even with the help of flash.  The flash is so weak that it hardly reach over 6 ft.  Using the red-eye reduction function will further induce handshaking effects and ghosting effects when taking pictures indoor due time required to steadily hold the camera is longer.  Ironically, a camera of it's size is prone to red-eye since the lens and the flash is so closely located.In short, the image quality of all the pictures T7 took are disappointingly lower than the pictures took with my 2 years old Canon S400.  The supporters of T7 may argue that T7 is much smaller than S400.  That's true, however, personally, at this price, I would expect the picture quality is on par or at least come close to my 2 years old S400.PRO- Super slim, super stylish and attractive- Body feels sturdy and well build- 2.5\" large LCD screen- Very fast start timeCONS- Difficult to hold steadily- Weak flash- Weak battery life (Additional battery pack cost $50)- Use MS Duo/Duo Pro (Which costs approx 50% more than SD with similar speed)- Pictures taken indoor are noisy and grainy- Prone to red eye, but prone to hand shake when using red eye reduction- Lens and LCD screen are prone to fingerprintsAfter playing with the T7 and the comparison tests with my old S400, it is very clear to me that T7 isn't a camera that worth its price.  The bottom line, how good is a camera if it can't take even decent quality pictures even though it looks cool on the outside?  I am going to return it to the store and luckly they don't charge for restocking.I am going to continue my research on the other cameras on my list (Nikon S1, Panasonic FX7 and Canon SD400) which are just a little thicker than T7 and cost approx $100 less!  So far, I have seen less complaints on each of these cameras than T7.", "Date": "June 10, 2005"}, {"Title": "Great Camera, But Don't Use Default Settings", "Author": "C. W. Robertson \"CWR\"", "ReviewID": "R35Q8CQLP61FK0", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I just bought a new DSC-T7, and was a bit concerned about the picture quality at first.  The indoor pictures seemed dark and blurry, and outdoor pictures were of inconsistent quality.  The problem was with Sony's default settings for the camera.  They were not appropriate for the \"point-and-click\" photography that most novice photographers like myself want to use it for.  The Focus setting comes out of the box at \"Multi AF\", but \"Center AF\" yields a much better result.  The same holds true for the Metering setting, which comes out of the box set at \"Multi\", but works much better at \"Center\".  After adjusting these settings, I've been completely satisfied with the DSC-T7.  I wanted a small camera with sophisticated but easy-to-use features, and this camera is the smallest and best in its category.

Csakany \"Nick C\"", "ReviewID": "R1CB9FPHGNEDJQ", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "The DSC-T7 camera from Sony takes the concept of portability to a whole new level. Remember the Motorola brick phones of the early 1990's? Well, that's how most of the other cameras currently on the market will leave you feeling once you've held the DSC-T7. This smallness however comes at a price; people used to larger cameras may take some time to get comfortable using this camera. I use a Canon EOS-20D for more serious photography, and switching to this camera for casual use almost makes me distracted due to its smallness. My wife however loves it.Pictures have the typical Sony look to them: crisp, sure and accurate. Coloring is almost dead-on correct; however Sony's in-camera post processing gives images a dynamic boost which, while looking very good, may look slightly unnatural to some pros. But then again, there are uses and there are cameras. For a travel camera and casual shooting, there is simply no match for the DSC-T7. On the other hand, no one will use it in a studio for professional photography, which is OK as well.I only wish that Sony were offering a carrying case as standard issue with this camera; it is a pity that they had decided to carry it as a separate item. It would be a shame to drop the DSC-T7 and have nicks and scratches on it. At least our box did not come with it, and here's hoping that Sony will at one point decide to include the soft case as a standard accessory with every camera.Recommended: 5 out of 5 stars.", "Date": "May 22, 2005"}, {"Title": "An amazing camera!!", "Author": "E. Shantz", "ReviewID": "RXMR910YTE873", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "When I found this digital camera at Best Buy, I decided to go to Amazon to read the customer reviews before purchasing it. After reading several so-so reviews, I was a bit wary to order the camera, but just couldn't get over it's incredible thinness, so I bought it. It arrived yesterday, and let me tell you, I am smitten. If I had to go back and make the decision again, I would choose this model in a heartbeat.After playing around a little with the standard features, I decided to try out this new-fangled-spangled magnifiying glass feature. For those of you who don't quite understand what it is, it's basically a setting where you can hold the camera lens as close to something as you want and it will focus and take the picture clearly. It's an amazing tool, and I've fallen in love with it! I tried taking a picture of my eye with my old blocky digital camera, but my optical fibers were never clear. This one, however, is amazingly sharp!As I said before, I was scared to buy the camera because of some negative reviews it had recieved. Let me tell you from my viewpoint, as an amateur photographer, how I feel about some of the \"problems\":1. Focus: It is true that the flash doesn't reach throughout an entire room, which can sometimes make a picture blurry, but if you play around a bit with the settings, things will eventually clear up.2. Lens cover: I haven't had much of a problem with it sliding open on accident. You just have to be careful where you store it. The one time I did find the cover open, the camera was turned off. Maybe it had turned itself off? Probably just an accident on my part though.3. Battery cover: I didn't find the door flimsy at all.4. Battery life: It may be a bit short, but it hasn't bothered me yet.5. Finger in lens: Once you figure out the correct way of holding the camera, it's easy to avoid this annoyance.That's all I can think of right now.

This camera is the ultimate in portability - it fits in a shirt or pants pocket without a problem and makes it a camera that you will want to take with you everywhere. The unit has an integrated lens cover that also serves as an on/off switch which makes it quick and easy to use. It lacks a view finder but does have a large and easily readable display which works well even in direct sunlight. The Memory Stick Pro memory cards work well but are a bit of a disappointment in that I have several of the full sized ones that I purchased for use with my other Sony cameras that cannot work with this unit. The Memory Stick Pro sticks do come with an adapter that allows me to use them with my legacy Sony cameras so at least my new investments can be used across all the memory stick devices. The pictures are sharp and the color fidelity is very good. The DSCT7 comes with a special adapter that needs to be attached to the camera to provide a USB connection for downloading to the computer. I have a Sony computer so I just put the memory stick into the full size adapter and put it into the memory stick reader on the computer. **Note to Sony computer owners** Make certain to download the Memory Stick Pro drivers from the Sony web site or your computer WILL crash every time you try to read the Memory Stick Pro cards. The flash is very small and does a decent job at very short range but should not be relied on for taking group pictures in low light conditions. Battery life is exceptionally good and you should get close to 100 pictures with a full charge of the standard battery supplied. It doesn't come with an integrated charger so you need to remove the battery and put it into an external charger (supplied) - not a big deal but not as convenient as some of their other models that can simply be plugged in to a power cord without removing the battery from the camera.

I have been using camera since Xmas - about a month.  Everything works great.  The picture quality is comparable to T1 if not better.  The size is definitely a big plus.  However, I would recommend buying a T1 instead of T7 for 2 reasons.1. Charger:  This is the dumbest thing Sony ever did.  To charge the camara, you have to take the battery out of the camara and put it in the charger.  This may not sound like a big chore, but like many mp3 players before iPod... little things matter.  It's such a hassle to charge the battery.  If you shoot frequently, you will have to do this once every 3 days.  Too bad, I couldn't return mine.  Otherwise, for such a convenient camera, its inconvenience supercedes its size.2. Lens cover:  The mechanism of the cover is great.  When you slide the cover open, the camera switches on.  However, when you have it in your pocket, often the lens cover slides open by itself.  Not a major thing, but annoyance nevertheless.  Because it's on when you don't know it, you're wasting more battery life... thus problem 1 surfaces again.If you can tolerate these 2 design flaws, then T7 may be the camera for you.", "Date": "February 2, 2006"}, {"Title": "Excelent Point and Shoot Camera", "Author": "Aaron Barnaby", "ReviewID": "R3OTBTWPYWAVLK", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I am very pleased with the camera.

Flash doesn't carry but 5ft which is a problem because though the camera has a good quality Carl Zeiss lens, it is very small and the max apertures are not great which means in practice that the flash cuts in all the time when on auto and if it doesn't and its not bright sunshine, then you get camera shake.  Worst I've yet seen for that.My battery gives about 80 min on the readout after a full charge in picture mode, but if you use the flash, it murders it in no-time at all.Though the menus are easy to access, certain functions like increasing the exposure one stop etc... are several levels down and are hard to find.  Conversely, it is very easy to change picture size, flash setting etc...I bought this as I have a young daughter and wanted to be able to capture shots even when I didn't have my Canon EOS D60 available.  I bought it to replace an Olympus C-2000 2.1 Mp which I gave to my parents.  Though the new sony is very compact and dead cool to have out, I'd probably rather go back to the 2.1Mp Olympus if I needed to get a great shot.  1600x1200 is quite enough for the average person as long as the quality is good.  2592x1944 is great for cropping but doesn't replace a quality image to begin with.Herewith the big proof that the \"how about another Megapixel\" game that the manufacturers play is to be avoided.  If you want to take very specific types of pictures, outdoors bright sunlight or indoors portrait close flash, it does very well.  The full screen video is actually quite good as long as you have great light too.  Everything else I found very disappointing.

I had the original 2.1 megapix Cybershot and used it for almost 10 years before buying the T7.Sony has long enjoyed a leading position among digicam makers, but the Sony T7 breaks new ground in slim camera design, and  the market is voting an emphatic yes to the T7.  The T7 is a full-featured digicam, with a 5 megapixel CCD, a 3x optical zoom lens, a huge 2.5-inch LCD screen, and a wide range of options that include variable ISO settings, color saturation, contrast, and sharpness adjustments. The Auto exposure mode  offers point-and-shoot ease, supplemented by a choice of 10 different scene modes for more challenging shooting situations (Magnifying Glass, Twilight, Twilight Portrait, Candle, Soft Snap, Landscape, High Speed Shutter, Beach, Snow, or Fireworks  modes).  The T7's slimness has, however, led to some interface compromises, including an external charger and a dock that offers no connectivity.The T7's Carl Zeiss lens is superbly crafted and delivers great color, solid resolution, and good dynamic range. It also produces good sharpness in the corners, which is uncommon for subcompacts.  Despite its tiny size, the T7 packs an amazingly rich menu of features, great shooting speed, and even fantastic video (with sound) capabilities.It delivers rock solid colors, better than average accuracy, bright and vibrant without being overdone. The big 2.5\" LCD screen, entirely usable in full sun and even in dim lighting, is a pleasure to use to frame your shots.  Shutter response time is excellent. So is the bright Auto Focus-Assist lamp.  Finally, for downloading your photos to a PC, the T7 connects with the PC via a very fast USB 2.0  connection.About its only significant limitations for me are its fairly  limited low light capability, short battery life and weak flash output.  Some may also lament the absence of a separate  Aperture Priority and also a Shuttle Priority mode.

I was quick to put it on charge, but unfortunately that's when my delight ended. The pictures this camera takes are just below par. It takes good photos if you want to do everything manually (focus, white balance, etc), but if I wanted to do that I would buy an SLR. The photos are all off in some way or another, all either washed out, too dark, over exposed, etc.The truth is that I wanted a point-and-click camera to replace my trusty, but aging Canon S230. This definitely is NOT it. I have heard good things about the Casio and Canon ranges, and am now keeping my fingers crossed that I can return this unit without issue.The other problem I have is that I wanted a camera that I could slide into my pocket and carry around with me without needing a belt pack. Unfortunately the lens slider (which switches the camera on and off) engages way too easily, so often the battery goes flat in my pocket.The caveat on everything I've said above, is that if you want something as a talking piece, the T7 is definitely it.

Including all the accessories (extra battery, memory sticks, carrying case, tripod,underwater protector,...), I would say I had invested 600+ bucks for everything. If I knew Sony would release T9 with super steady shot in a short time, I might think differently. T7 did a great job while shooting outdoors or when plenty of light is available. However, it was almost impossible to take indoor pictures or night shots without a tripod. For its compact size and conveniences, I still like this camera a lot. After a year and half of usage, recently the LCD of my T7 sometimes just blacked out without reasons, although you can still take pictures, and the black screen will go back to normal after a few seconds (or reboot the camera). This could be annoying since T7 is built without a viewfinder, so you rely on the LCD for doing almost everything.update: For my Las Vegas trip, I bought a Panasonic Lumix FX07, and carried my T7 as backup. Well, what can I say? The picture quality of T7 is so much better than the FX07. For night scene, I used tripod and compared these two cameras. T7 allows you set ISO at 64, while the lowest FX07 can go is 100. T7 gives you more true-to-life color and sharp pictures; FX07 tends to be cold and has watercolor effect (if you view the pics at full-size, but I guess 8X6 prints would be OK). Maybe battery life is the only thing that FX07 is better than T7. I would consider T-series as my first choices for future DC purchases.

Another downside is the battery does not last for that long, although I have never had it run out of battery after only a day of usage, but usually if I don't charge the battey for a week, it does not have much battery left (but that might be becaue I use it a lot).So I deffinatly recommend this camera.

Schwind", "ReviewID": "R1CNAVJYTA0WTW", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Through most of the 1990s, I lived overseas in both Europe and Asia.  Unfortunately, my number of photos from these times are limited to a handful as I hated looking like a \"tourist\" with my bulky camera!  Nowadays, I no longer have to worry about that because of cameras like this one!  I intially bought this T7 after using a friend's T1 and being impressed with the size of it.  The T7 is obviously considerably smaller, which is even better!I bought this camera right as they were coming out and paid well over $400 for it plus a 1GB Memory Stick Pro.  Both are investments that even to this day (over a year later) I am very happy with.  I have taken this camera just about everywhere and wherever I go people love to look at it.  I can say I've probably sold at least a dozen of these to people that fell in love with the size of the camera and the quality of photos it takes.As far as size, that is the biggest plus to it's advantage.  It can fit anywhere.  Even with the optional case that you can buy for it, it still easily fits in a trouser or jacket pocket, without even a noticable bulge.As far as photo quality goes, as most of the reviews note, the camera is very limited when it comes to night time shots.  I've found that these shots are often hit and miss as far as what you'll get, but for the size of the lens and the size of the flash, what can you expect?  After shooting a few thousand photos with this camera, I know what will be a good and bad night shot, and with the playback feature, you can quickly see the quality of your photo and retake if needed.  Is it perfect? No, but that's super tough in a camera this small.Some reviews note the difficulty trying to take a photo while holding the camera still.  I've never had issue with this, but I could see how it could be an issue, it's just never one either my wife (the primary user) or I have dealt with.  I would venture that probably the vast majority of buyers of this camera will likewise not have a problem.I've recorded more than a few .mpg movies with the camera and it surprisingly outperformed some of my bigger (and more expensive) point-and-shoot digital cameras.  I have been very pleased with that.Another drawback noted by many reviews is the LCD screen and the chance of breaking it.  I put a plastic screen protector (the thin plastic sheet type held by static) on it as soon as I bought it and haven't had a problem.  I've sat on the camera before (by accident, of course!) and have had it in luggage and the like, but have never had a problem.The most significant drawback that I've had with the camera is that it can take more photos (esp with the 1GB card) than the battery will last.  Buy a second battery and you'll be more than good, but it's just something to keep in mind.I would highly recommend this camera for anyone who travels, or anyone who wants a camera to take quick photos.  It can be carried anywhere and for the vast majority of shots, it's all that you need. I can say that we have many photos of our kids (and really good ones, too) that we would never had gotten if my wife didn't regularly carry this camera in her purse and diaper bag! I'm happy enough with it that I'm going to buy a second one for myself (especially now that the prices have dropped so much!) so that my wife can use our first one entirely for her own photography.

So this \"low prices\" thing that Amazon constantly displays is actually a charade. Don't let Amazon.com rip you off!!!", "Date": "May 15, 2005"}, {"Title": "TOPS ALL DIGITAL CAMERAS", "Author": "S.

It came with a 32Mb Duo MG memory stick. The memory sticks came with an adaptor to fit into standard memory stick slots.Only the 32Mb memory stick could be read by my daughters Sony Vaio PCG-GRX550 (marked MG at the memory stick port), and by the adaptor on my Desktop.Went to Sony Tech Support site and found a huge list of laptops that DIDN'T work with the ProDuo and required a utility, which I downloaded but couldn't open.Then I called Tech Support and the agent went on endlessly \"searching\" to find a solution to the problem. in between asking a number of times why I didn't just download from the camera. There are lots of obvious reasons which I gave him and then he went on \"searching.\" He also said that the utility I tried to download wouldn't enable me to read the stick. Finally he transferrred me to someone \"higher up,\" and the whole converstion was virtually repeated. And this agent also kept suggesting I use the camera to down-load, and I kept repeating why it wasn't practical, and why it defeated half the purpose of the memory stick in the first place.At last, at last, he said the ProDuo was incompatible with my LapTop, and my Desk-Top reader. I had to waste a vacation afternoon to find this out, and I'm sure they knew this the instant I called. Why isn't this information available when purchasing off their web site. Why don't they tell you this on their support site or in the users manual. After all that, I still don't know how to read the memory stick. Is there a USB adaptor that reads it? But now you have to carry more junk around with you.Tere is an option. Instead of buying the 521Mb ProDuo at $65, you can buy four 128Mb (largest) Duos at $40 apiece.I really can't judge picture quality. My daughter says it is OK. But with the two pictures I did take, I noticed that the camera automatically focused on the subject and then went out of focus when you started to press the shutter. I don't know if this is typical.I can't believe the reviews of this camera. How do these reviewers read the memory stick? Do they work for Sony?Note the memory stick convenience was one of the reasons for buying LapTop. Aha, the solution is now obvious: Buy a new LapTop which ONLY reads ProDuo memory sticks. After you have bought the LapTop a new memory stick comes out which you can't read? And then what do you do? You guessed it.It does look nice, it's portable, and the lens cover is a nice feature.", "Date": "January 1, 2006"}, {"Title": "Not Satisfied  with Dsc-T7 nor Satisfied with butterfly photo", "Author": "F.
