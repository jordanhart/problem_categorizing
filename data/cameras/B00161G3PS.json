It worked okay for a couple of months and then started having numerous problems. I called and sent e-mails to the SVAT company for months but did not get a response until today and that was to inform me that they would not do anything because the system is no longer under warranty and suggested I spend another $700.00 to replace some of the faulty equipment I purchased. Of course I got no response from this company while the equipment was under warranty. VERY BAD EQUIPMENT and VERY UNETHICAL BUSINESS PRACTICES!I wish I could give them a minus 9 rating!!!!", "Date": "August 24, 2009"}, {"Title": "Clearvu3 security system", "Author": "Constanze Russell", "ReviewID": "R22HQHVUHAAS5", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I bought this item 4 months ago and love it.Picture quality is outstanding better then expected.Customer service is really good as well.Would highly recommend this itemConstanze Russell", "Date": "January 17, 2009"}, {"Title": "Great!!!", "Author": "Newton G.
