I would not be afraid to throw it in my backpack on the go.-The camera fits really nicely in your hand without any problem. It is a LOT smaller than the G1x and a lot easier to store for almost the same picture quality.-Picture quality is significantly improved from the G15. The difference in low-light pictures is really noticeable due to the f/1.8-2.8 aperture.-WiFi feature is a really nice addition. You can put pictures on your iPhone fairly easily.-tons of creative modes allow for tons of different and unique shots without having to use manual mode.-The software is a lot faster. You can move around the options really fast without much lag at all.-Much better user experience than either the Nikon P7800 or P7700CONS-Decent noise at high ISOs, but not uncommon to others in the category-Price is not very good when considering the S120 has many of the same features for less and the G1x has a lot more features for barely any more. Just awkward pricing situation.-some of the settings are hard to differentiate from each other.-Can be difficult setting up Wifi originally.This camera is so close to the G1x, I would advise spending the extra $100 and getting the four-thirds sensor the G1x comes with over this. This camera is also really close to the S120 but comes in the familiar G body style most people are accustomed to. So if you need something to fit in your pocket for travel, I would get the S120. This camera has almost the same features of both so its in a really weird product position. I would just get the S120 over this unless you need the hotshoe and the viewfinder that come with this instead of the touchscreen on the S120.", "Date": "November 18, 2013"}, {"Title": "Great small point and shoot for those who need to shoot RAW on the go", "Author": "I. Band", "ReviewID": "REG5F3DPV8Z0J", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I usually use my Canon 6D for photography, but I needed something small to carry around that shot in RAW.  This fits the bill.  A great improvement over my G10, the G16 image quality is top notch.  There are many auto modes that I've played with as well that work nicely.  While I love shooting in aperture preferred mode, there's a setting that allows you to take portrait shot and the setting blurs the background for you (basically, it takes two shots and blurs the background).  It works surprisingly well, and takes the worry out of choosing an aperture, etc.If you like to shoot in RAW and need something more portable than a DSLR, check out the G16.", "Date": "December 17, 2013"}, {"Title": "Impressive performance", "Author": "Fuacata", "ReviewID": "R3UGWMDV79GKSR", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "The first thing you'll notice about the G16 is its ability to capture a great photo in low light.  I attribute that to the sensor being the largest of all its predecessors.  The menu has the familiar Canon Powershot layout.  I tend to take most photos in Program mode and I have to say the performance has been excellent.  I like that the exposure compensation dial is near my thumb so I can make adjustments quickly after taking a photo.  The 60 fps video capture is much smoother than any of my previous compact cameras.  Lastly the frame rate in burst mode is faster than my Canon 60D DSLR and puts any of my previous compacts to shame.  If I had to find any fault in the camera it would be the optical view finder is small and hard to get a good sense of your frame  before shooting.  I highly recommend this camera.UPDATE 2014-01-21I have been getting periodic \"Memory Card Error\" at startup.  I have a Sandisk Extreme 32GD SDHC 80MB/s card.  I have replaced the card with the same model.  Still got the periodic errors. Finally I replaced the camera last week with another G16.  Still get the errors.  Sent an email to Canon and waiting for response.  Will try a slower SD card and see if it makes a difference.UPDATE 2014-01-28Problem Solved. The \"Memory Card Error\" problem I was periodically receiving at start-up was resolved by switching brands on the SD card.  After receiving the error on two identical Sandisk Extreme cards and two Canon G16's, I concluded that switching brands on the SD card was the next logical step.  Canon support recommended that I send in the camera for repair.  Despite explaining to them that the odds of a hardware failure was remote given I had tried two different G16's, they still insisted I send in the camera for repair--I did not.  I asked if the SanDisk Extreme Plus 32 GB SDHC Class 10 UHS-1 Flash Memory Card 80MB/s (SDSDXS-032G-AFFP) was supported and they responded that there are too many cards to test them all (read: we have no idea).  I have other cameras which have either Sandisk or Transcend SD cards in them.  I tried all the cards and the Sandisk got the error while the Transcend did not.  So I exchanged my SD card for the Transcend 32 GB High Speed Class 10 UHS Flash Memory Card TS32GSDHC10U1E 85/45 MB/s.  I have been using the camera for a week with not a single Memory Card Error encountered.  Strange but true.", "Date": "January 1, 2014"}, {"Title": "Reliable quality", "Author": "S. Vogt", "ReviewID": "R43MGNIV2S57Q", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This camera really has no nasty surprises to it. It takes excellent photos and decent video, is a great performer, well-built, great ergonomics, and has an easy to use interface. In other words, a typical Canon.Like its predecessors before it, the camera produces nice photos, especially when you consider its sensor size. Canon has done a great job of squeezing out all they can from this relatively small 1/1.7\" sensor. Image quality is not night and day over the G15, but it captures a little more detail in the lower ISO settings. Noise performance is unchanged from the G15. You can only get 100% clean images from this camera at largest sizes through ISO200, but things really don't start getting sloppy until you get past ISO1600. The camera does a good job of balancing noise, noise reduction, and detail retention up the ISO scales. If you're willing to shoot and process the RAW files, you might be able to get away with larger prints up to ISO1600. In summary, it has the best noise performance of its enthusiast compact peers with the same size sensor but is not surprisingly behind the Sony RX100 II and about on par with the Fuji X20. Color performance is good as always. Overexposure is still a bit of an issue but it doesn't seem to blow out highlights as bad as the G15 did.The autofocus system on this camera is fast and reliable, but not night and day over its predecessor like Canon claims. I find in low light the AF to be only slightly faster but to put this in context, the G15 was an all around decent performer in the autofocus department. Most people should be pretty happy with the performance, though. The lens zooms in and out quickly. Burst performance is remarkable on this camera and it can qualify as an excellent budget action shooter, especially if you shoot JPEG. Image stabilization is also rock solid.Ergonomics are great on the camera. I like the more rounded hand grip vs. the G15. The menu system remains straight forward and easy to use. Battery life is excellent and the camera feels sturdy and well-built. The LCD on back is bright and clear. The optical viewfinder is usable but Nikon has stepped up the game a little bit by including the EVF in their P7800. While it's not the greatest EVF around (still not bad), it provides a better viewfinder shooting experience than the G16.I don't think anybody who buys this camera will be disappointed. It is not a ground breaking product, but does everything reliably well and like the G15, will give you many years of good photos and dependable operation. Recently the G16 has been selling for around $450 on Amazon, which I think is a pretty decent price for what you get.", "Date": "October 5, 2013"}, {"Title": "Compare the G16 to the G15", "Author": "Amazon Customer", "ReviewID": "R3D6OBRPPZ5C4G", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "If you really need/want Wi-Fi, then you are probably amenable to spending $200 more for the G16 ($499) versus a very worthy G15 ($299).

My G9 has the flash on the front, I don't understand why this camera now requires you to open the flash to use it.  There is no point.2. If you take more than 1,000 photos you cannot transfer them to your computer using the built-in Canon wi-fi!That's right - if you have over 1,000 images on your SD card, you cannot wirelessly transfer them.  I was also unable to connect my camera to my computer with a USB cable.  You MUST remove the SD card, and use an SD card reader to transfer your photos!I think that is a pretty stupid design or limitation, considering I am using a 32 GB SD card and can easily shoot thousands of pictures in a few hours, and you'd think Canon would have designed their camera for that.For reference, this is what happens:1.  Install the Canon software.2.  When prompted to plug in your camera via USB cable, the camera says \"Communication error\" on the screen, and your computer will not recognize the camera.Canon's website says this:> Message: Communication error> An excessive amount of images (approx. 1,000) on the memory card prevented printing or image transfer to a computer.

I've never personally owned a DSLR but I have worked with the earlier canon Rebel series before (namely the T2i) and although it doesn't come close to the handling and feel of a real DSLR, it still feels great in the hand and the quality of images produced by this compact camera are still great!I decided to purchase this camera in order to use it on a 6 week trip around Scotland and England.  Because of the nature of my trip which partially consisted of backpacking around the countryside and moving from city to city, I was a bit concerned about carrying a DSLR and lenses around so I wanted a compact camera but didn't want to sacrifice on quality, so I considered the Canon PowerShot G16.  I spent less as opposed to purchasing a DSLR and I am also literally able to pocket the camera while still getting really clear and true images of my travels.I took over 3500 photos and videos and I am really happy with all of them.  The photos in low lighting turned out great, any photo taken with ISO levels up to 3200 came out clear with little noise, but anything above that started getting pretty noisy.  Luckily the camera is preset to not go above 3200 ISO but that can be changed if so desired.  I personally like my photos a little darker for contrast and I was able to take great photos everywhere I went in nearly all lighting conditions.  I was also able to take pictures of the stars by taking advantage of manual settings as well as taking some artsy shots using long exposure playing with lights.  Manual focus also came in handy when the camera couldn't quite focus on what I wanted it to.  The range of the lens is great.  I can take nice wide angle photos of landscape and cities and the 5x zoom helps to focus in on architecture, wildlife or other interesting things.The camera is very quick, it turns on and off quickly and the manual controls (after getting used to it) allow me to quickly adjust exposure, aperture, shutter speed and ISO when the program features just aren't enough to get the right shot.  There are handy screen features such as a leveler and grid in order to really help align images as well as a quick zoom to make sure the image is in focus.  The build is really sturdy and has a good weight to it making it feel really stable as well as comfortable in my right hand.Battery life is also very good.  I can take pictures all day for a couple of days before it dies.  I bought a spare battery which guaranteed that it would never die on me when I really wanted to snap a photo.The video quality is really great for a compact, being able to take full 1080pHD videos in 60fps (I personally prefer 30fps which can be set instead of 60) as well as having an optical stabilizer making the video very smooth with hardly any shaking.I hardly ever used the optical viewfinder only because it was just a tunnel viewfinder but when the sunlight was too bright to see the LCD screen (which was rare), it did come in handy and the images are true to what is seen in the viewfinder.I really love this camera and will probably be very happy using the Canon PowerShot G16 for a very long time.  I am not a professional photographer, but this camera goes above and beyond my needs and expectations.  I could see any enthusiast enjoying this camera, the images in low lighting aren't flawless by any means but they are still pretty amazingly clear for a compact.

That's a pretty short time period, but I think I take LOTS more photos than the average person - 10-20 a day on average - and I carry it with me everywhere. When I bought the G12 I was really planning on getting my first DSLR camera but a professional photographer friend as well as the guy at the camera store talked me out of it. As they said \"If you're buying this to record your everyday moments you will use this a lot more. It is small enough that it's not a burden to throw in your purse.\" They were absolutely right! So when I needed another camera I didn't have to think much before deciding to go with this upgrade.The articulated screen on the G12 was really nice to have and I miss it a lot. I would rather have a bit more bulk but the flexibility of the screen. Both cameras have the same problem with the dial at the top becoming easily switched to a new setting, which is frustrating. I have to consciously think to look and see if it's where I last set it every time I take it out of my purse. The low light capabilities on this camera are amazing! I loved this feature with the G12 and this one is even better! I pretty much NEVER need to use the flash.My only other criticism of this camera (and it sounds like most of the cameras are doing this now) is that you have to download the manual. HUH?

I had a Canon Powershot A710 IS which was more than adequate for my needs, but every few years I get the yen to upgrade to something newer and better.  After reviewing multiple cameras from about five manufacturers, I decided to stick with Canon.This is a grown-up point-and-shoot.  I won't regale you with camera specs.  Lots of reviews already do that.  This camera is a major step up from the Powershot 710.  It is marginally bigger and heavier, but it packs a lock of punch.  Bottom line: it takes outstanding pictures and videos.  It has numerous \"scene\" modes that all work as advertised.  It's not quite a DSLR, but if you don't want a hefty camera with interchangeable lens, it is a great choice.One thing I demand in a camera is a viewfinder.  The G16 has one.  It doesn't look through the lens, not would I expect it to since that would require an expensive and bulky mirroring system.  So the viewfinder isn't perfect.  But you soon learn how it differs from what you see on the screen display.  And it absolutely essential (in my opinion) since the screen is often very difficult to see in bright sunlight (and that's where a lot of my pictures are taken).  That is not a knock on the G16 as I have trouble seeing ANY camera screen in bright sunlight (and I've tried lots of them).The camera takes a 64 GB SDXC memory card, so I can use it for a long time without worrying about filling up the card.  The camera supports wireless, a nice feature for transferring your pictures to your computer without bothering to remove the SD card or connecting the camera via a USB cord.  A USB cord is not included with the camera, but it is easy enough to buy one.  I am using an old USB cord of the right size, and it works perfectly.  The setup of the wireless feature is, I must say, extremely arcane.  I am an IT professional and it took me several tries to get it to work.The popup flash works about as you expect it to.  It's not very effective, but is better than nothing for emergencies.  You can attach a very effective flash easily, but I chose not to lug one around with me.The camera actually fits into the old case that I purchased for the A710, but it's snug.  I decided on a better case and opted for the Black Rapid Snapr 20.  It's the perfect size, and I love the case's concept.

My Canon N gives a video minus the stops for the picture. I actually prefer the quality of my Canon G12's photos better but my camera was taken over by my husband, and I sold the G15. I ended up buying the G1x but will keep this camera for macro shots and wait for the price of the new G1x to come down.", "Date": "April 19, 2014"}, {"Title": "The Secret Weapon of Cameras", "Author": "Pearls of Vision", "ReviewID": "R28TS1KDRDLAY2", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I have 2  Cannon DSLR's which I use professionally and I wanted something to take on non-photo based trips (like to NYC in the middle of a blizzard) to catch some good shots and have flexibility in case there was something special I wanted to shoot.

I have to admit, though, that many cameras by reputable makers (and there are many) deliver what they promise. It is more about what camera traits you are looking for. So, I would suggest to anyone looking to buy one to google 'camera trait search' and go from there.The G16 is a fixed lens camera (point and shoot, some would say), with 12.1 resolution (megapixels), and x5 zoom. Probably the most important point for this class of cameras is the sensor size, which is 1/1.7 inch CMOS-type. That is just a number, but one that matters. Most point and shoots have a 1/2.3 inch sensor, which is a couple of steps worse than the G16.It also has a viewfinder, which many don't. The ISO rating is 12,800 which makes it work better in low light. The video is a Full HD- that is 1980x1080 resolution. The camera gives you the option to control manually both the exposure and the focus. It does have an external flash option. That is a plus too, especially for portraits. It comes equipped with WiFi and GPS. The LCD screen has a 922,000 resolution, and the burst rate- for fast action- of 9.3 specified works well. The camera also does RAW processing which would matter if you did not want to be limited by JPEG storage only. And all this with a fairly light camera weighing only 356 grams.Overall, great camera. Having been into photography for a while, I do stress though that you do a camera trait search.
