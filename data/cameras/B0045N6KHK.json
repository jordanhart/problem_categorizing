But after a lot of effort building a deer fence around our garden we discovered that something was still managing to get in and eat our flowers and vegetables. Set this thing up without a lot of stress and were stunned the very next day to be watching the tape of when the motion detector activated the camera - this one great big buck just walked up and lept right over the fence. No running start. Just boi-oi-oi-ng, and he was over. then boing and hhe was out again. So it's been back to the drawing board, but at least this time we can actually see who is doing what and when. Kinda fun, but kind of disheartening. This deer is on springs or something.", "Date": "August 14, 2013"}, {"Title": "This is not wireless.
