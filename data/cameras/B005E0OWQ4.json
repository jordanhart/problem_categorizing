But if your looking to buy it for wildlife shooting or kids, is better to buy the kit that comes with the 55-250 mm zoons len, it has image stabilization system and works better when the object is quite far away from you or moving, if you buy this kit with the 75-300mm lens will have to program the continuous shooting to avoiding camera shake and blurry pictures.

Livesay \"DianaL\"", "ReviewID": "R85ZK8DCVBNMA", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "i had my worries when i decided to order this bundle, but it turned out to be the best purchased ive ever made. im not a pro when it comes about SLR cameras, but the T3 is perfect for professional photographers or begginers. im an intermediate photographer and future photography student and i know this is going to be my best friend for a long time. the camera works great, it has plenty of options to play with, and accesorries that will be lifesavers when you dont have local stores that offer them around you. i still have to learn all its functions, but i can say the image quality this camera gives is exceptional. you get 4 lens to play with. the 300mm doesnt have an image stabilizator, but if you dont mind manual work and continuous shooting you'll find it useful. it doesnt zoom as much as i thought but its still great for medium distance. if you have shaky hands like me you will absolutely love the tripod. i never used tripods before, but this camera can be very heavy with the 300mm on and the tripod's a life saver. i had a little trouble with the card reader because i barely pulled the card out of it, i didnt put it in wrong because my computer read it without problems.also i didnt really know how to use the 2 extra lens at first. they pretty much screw on the default lens like a lid. theres a macro piece that you have to unscrew off the lens and use them alone . they catch beautiful macros. but make sure you're not all the way zoomed out when you use the extra lens because they create a little vignette. stay zoomed in a little and should fix the problem dont be afraid making this investment. its great in long run and easy to learn. it has manuals that will help you and you'll get everything for just the price of the camera", "Date": "February 11, 2013"}, {"Title": "All great, but 1 item!", "Author": "Very Satisfied Customer", "ReviewID": "RVMVHB6QVB80M", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Everything was fantastic including the customer service, but the telephoto and wide-angle lens kit that comes with it is terrible! I sent it back and got a refund of $19.95 for the telephoto and wide-angle lens kit. In the description of the package deal, it says these lens attachments are Precision Design brand. The brand they came packaged in says ZEIKOS. Look up reviews about the \"Zeikos wide angle and telephoto lens kit\" and you will see that across the board customers think it is terrible! Maybe they can remove the terrible wide angle and telephoto lens kit and reduce the package deal by $20? It would have eliminated a lot of hassle for me to ship it back.Everything else was fantastic! Great, easy to use camera that can do everything the basic photographer would like it to do and more.

Has all the basics you need to get started and I was pleasantly surprised by the quality of what I got for the price. The seller is fantastic as well and has great customer service. I know this because I didn't mean to order this product. I meant to order the Canon Rebel T3i (this package is the T3)...I had specifically researched it because I do videography for my job. I wanted a microphone input and a flip screen. I opened this package and couldn't find the mic input--my heart sunk when I realized I picked the wrong one. I need a crisp audio channel for what I do professionally--so alas, I had to send this whole thing back.  The customer service was fantastic though...and I am very grateful for that! If you're not planning on doing video, however, or you're not concerned about having a separate audio channel for a microphone...it's a great camera for less than the T3i (and a fabulous package as well!).
