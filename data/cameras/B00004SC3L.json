{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Disappointing for a Canon camera", "Author": null, "ReviewID": "R3315IJWX1COMR", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "After being an exceptionally satisfied owner of a semi-automatic Canon camera, I expected to find the same level of satisfaction with my purchase of a Canon Z135 zoom camera. While the camera performs adequately well in  taking quality outdoor photos, it falls far behind in flash photography.  While advertised as having a red-eye reduction capability, I have found  red-eye to be an ongoing problem and existing in every photo where people  or animals are photographed. I am extremely disappointed in the performance  of this camera in the price range where it is sold.  I would expect this  level of quality to be acceptable only in a camera costing much less.  I  have owned this camera for two years and have discontinued using it because  of the frustration I feel when my prints are returned and do not meet my  level of expectation. I should have done more research before buying this  product where most of my selection was based on the Canon name.", "Date": "June 6, 2000"}, {"Title": "Very small viewfinder", "Author": null, "ReviewID": "R3D9CZY6N7SWH9", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "This camera takes excellent pictures once you focus on the subject if you can find the subject through the very small viewfinder.

It initially lived up to the Canon name, taking great pictures and providing ease of use. The 135mm zoom was outstanding. Unfortunately, that was short lived. Soon after ruining several rolls of vacation film with the camera the honeymoon was over. All the pictures were blurred beyond belief.  We sent it back for repair (the warranty had just ran out) and $90.00 later, we were taking pictures again. Now, 6 months later, the picture quality is, again, going to hell. Pictures are blurred. Red eye abounds.We are now looking at a new 35mm camera and we will certainly not be buying a Canon.", "Date": "January 23, 2001"}, {"Title": "A Super Camera That Takes Wonderful Shots!", "Author": "\"zekemaximus\"", "ReviewID": "ROLDLO5Q1R6O8", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "After my first Canon Z135 was left in a taxi in Thailand, I had an excuse to research a replacement all over again.  I don't tend to pick the same thing again when I can have something new and different, but there just isn't another compact zoom camera that takes pictures anywhere near the quality of those I get with my Z135 (you'll see what I mean when you buy one and compare).  The portraits are particularly stunning and the camera is much faster than others (the competitors use only one battery and take too long to focus and snap).  I used to lug around an SLR with various lenses, but this camera replaced all of it.  As a result, I tend to have it with me when the great shots are out there. The zoom range is impressive and the handy dial on the back makes it simple to turn on and shoot with.  This is a wonderful camera!", "Date": "December 2, 2001"}, {"Title": "This Camera is not the best........", "Author": "Karina Robinson", "ReviewID": "R1MNTQR2W5L2RT", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "As far as point and shoots go, this one is okay, its easy to use, its light weight, and the price is not to bad. I have owned this camera for 7 months now and I dislike it more and more as I get my processed film back. My pictures taken with the zoom at its maximum length turn out fuzzy, this doesn't happen when the zoom is partially used, only when it is all the way out.I love to take pictures of my children, but I find myself wanting higher quality snapshots than this camera allows for. Also the strap that comes with this camera is very cheap, the adjustable end kept slipping off, I ended up having to tie it in knots to keep it attatched to the camera.", "Date": "December 8, 2001"}, {"Title": "First Rate Camera", "Author": "Gerald Weinstein", "ReviewID": "R2RGSJBCW9VQS", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "A really great camera, produces the sharpest shots I have ever seen on any point and shoot and probably outdoes an SLR, really astonishing when you see the prints. Features are great, high shutter speed, dial works well, zoom device is smooth and quick, operation of whole camera is very quick, flash is very powerful On the negative side, camrera is on the large side, I knew that when I bought and accepted that,using it in macro mode far from easy, instruction manual is an enigma on this feature, when you finally figure it out, the parallax correction lines to thin and hard to see. Even with the minuses I consider the Z135 to be my camera of choice, I love the thing.", "Date": "June 5, 2001"}, {"Title": "Just take the picture!", "Author": null, "ReviewID": "R1S5ZK0AAOB0OC", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "I bought this camera several years ago and was extremely frustrated with it.  The zoom part is great, and the pictures, when I could get them, looked fine.  What I hated was that the camera wouldn't always take a picture when I wanted it to.  Probably my pictures weren't perfectly focused, didn't have the best lighting, etc., but I was hoping for spontaneity and instead got a camera that argued with me.  I like to snap pictures a bit before people are expecting it, so they don't get those frozen smiles.  With this camera, I often had to push the button one, two, three, four, five, sometimes six or more times before it finally took the picture, guaranteeing that my subjects were as artificial and annoyed as possible.  I tried every different setting but still had the same problem.  Many cute pictures of my small children were lost forever because of this camera.  I contacted Canon but they offered me no help whatsoever.  I will never buy a Canon again!", "Date": "December 27, 2000"}, {"Title": "Good but now broken", "Author": "GlennS \"hobo_b\"", "ReviewID": "RSPGJKAWHNCQR", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I have taken 1000s of photos with this camera over the years.  It only jammed up on me one time with a 36 exposure roll of film, I never went over a 24 exposure roll after that.  Unfortunately the camera door closure uses a little piece of plastic - and that one cheap piece ended the life of this camera - unless I can get a new door.  So I would say not as durable as some others indicated.  Since the door also encases some electronics this isn't likely to be a quick swap of doors.The amazing part about this camera is one little battery would last me what seemed like a year sometimes (I am sure it was close), even when taking 50 photos a week!  Many of those photos were with using the flash.Most of my photos look professional quality - friends always ask what camera I used to take such good photos.  I also take photos of our dogs - and the zoom works wonders as you can get back away and take a nicely lighted portrait.  Or catch them in action from across the yard.  Has been great on trips also (has been to 4 continents with me and small enough not to be a burden carrying around.Yes I would definitely purchase another - or maybe consider the Z155 which for some reason is slightly less expensive at this time.  I just wish they had put the extra effort in the camera door closure .. likely mine would be the last camera I needed for a long time.", "Date": "July 17, 2002"}, {"Title": "Three Years and A Half Later", "Author": "Jillian S. Hershberg", "ReviewID": "R3FMFW1OOOOD7D", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I bought this camera before my trip to South Dakota and was thrilled with the resolution of the pictures. People always complimented me on them as if I were a professional, and I thank Canon for that. I still get great pictures,however, I do have some complaints: Candid shots are gone before the shutter goes off; The date stamp is impossible to work with, and is permanentally stopped at 1992 (why 92 I don't know). The date winds up in the worst places in the picture. I won't ever set a date stamp again unless it's tiny and ends up on the extreme corner of a shot--I don't think this exists.I do love the pictures though even at the 135 zoom.", "Date": "February 9, 2002"}, {"Title": "A very nice camera (not perfect-but what is?)", "Author": null, "ReviewID": "RO2E4O5U4DUH4", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I've owned my Z135 for three years now and, in general, I love it.  Outdoor pictures are wonderful and rival my expensive Minolta SLR.  However, indoor shots are not consistently good.  I've never figured out exactly why some turn out well and others don't.  The flash seems to modulate well most of the time but significant wash out occurs at times.  Red eye is a problem (but not significantly worse that other point-and-shoots I've used).

Bilby \"littlebibs\"", "ReviewID": "R1IR2QNJRUQISR", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "I came home from a month's vacation in Japan back in 1999 with this nice little camera I picked up in Tokyo. After taking some of the most stunning photos on my way up Mt. Fuji and around the southern Japancountry side I thought this was just the best at the time. I got homeand started using it more indoors where it didn't perform the way I'dhoped, but some of the photos were just so perfect, the ones not so goodI chalked it up to whatever I was drinking?  But....the major flaw thatoccured with this camera was suddenly the two duracell ultra 123 lithum batteries for this camera @ $16.00-18.00 were getting eating within a 24 hours after I put them in the camera. It was a mistake to have purchasedthis in Japan as I was told there was something seriouly wrong and itwould COST to have it fixed. I was also told that the camera's flaw wasthe design of having the pop up flash on/off where it could accidentlycome on while in the camera bag.  I decided I didn't want to sent this outand put out more $$ for this.  I found taking the batteries out was thesmartest thing to do but if you forgot, the next day their dead,  didn't much care for dealing with this anymore... and now with all the newdigitals out, this will be a backup if I can find the batteries in thenear future??
