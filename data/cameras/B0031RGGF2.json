The old Kodak I had used AA batteries and was no longer taking pictures worth keeping. This was a spir of the moment purchase at Sam's Club so I did not have the chance to really look into it. Over 2 1/2 years later I have very positive things to say about it. It has taken quite a beating over the last several years through trips all over North America, kids (and me) dropping it from high heights, minor water spills, being dropped in snow, and countless other things. This camera came through hard and strong through everything. The only thing I really have no idea what happened and why was for some reason the video started recording in a odd file and I can only watch it in one program, VLC I believe.  The outdoor pictures turned out great, I have a few from places that look like they could be put on professional postcards. The indoor pictures can be a little grainy until you learn how to work with the flash and different settings. I never leave it on Auto as the pictures come out very blurry. This camera has a very wide selection of settings, everything from macro (Not the best but works pretty well), distant (once again, works pretty well), portrait (Works amazing! If you zoom in just a smige on this mode it turns out wonderful.) panorama (useless with kids but takes easy pictures of scenery, it even puts the other picture(s) up so you can stitch it well on the camera), and self portrait (this one leaves me in awe of the pictures it takes, outside ones are so great they are hard to describe).  This camera is not a high end camera but it is a really great camera that stands up to the beating families and live gives it. I recommend it.", "Date": "November 26, 2012"}, {"Title": "Really Easy-share", "Author": "cr", "ReviewID": "R1IYWDXPK08BW2", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Camera performs well, \"Share\" software downloaded quickly and easily, and the camera is small and yet takes good pictures.

I bought it twice in fact.  My three year old broke my first and I didn't even bother looking into getting another.  I have some other camera that takes batteries and hate how fast they die - love the rechargable battery which always lasts long enough, and the battery meter on the bottom of the screen is great.  I also had an older version of the Easy Share.  I cannot see myself ever getting anything different.", "Date": "October 5, 2011"}, {"Title": "Good buy!", "Author": "Gayla S.

I had to had a green camera, and this one stood out to me as soon as I saw it.  I purchased it and starting taking pictures right away.  I first took a picture of the sunset and was amazed on how well an $80 camera can take a picture.  I love the smart capture mode!  The share button really helps me upload my pictures to my accounts.

Moteberg", "ReviewID": "R2UIXVUB772B0H", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "Why we returned it:-The \"Smart Capture\" feature made 90% of the photos I took look \"blown out\" (white faces w/no depth). That meant that I had to figure out which Scene I wanted to use before each photo I took and that takes TIME!-The shape of the camera got in the way of my taking beautiful pictures. Sure, it's a handy size for sticking in your back pocket (if you like to do that sort of thing with a camera!) but it doesn't make for a sturdy piece of equipment to hold while steadying for the shot. It's completely square on each end, in the front and the back, so there's no groove for your thumb (in back) or finger (on front) to sit in while you steady the shot.-3x wide angle zoom is worthless. It hardly gets close to what you want to see. I took it with us to CA to Legoland and couldn't zoom in close enough to see my kid's over the railing of any rides.-The digital zoom available while using the video feature is worthless. I know it doesn't claim to do anything magical but you'd expect to get a bit more than blurry faces moving around.-It doesn't connect to the EasyShare charging base that we have for our previous Kodak EasyShare cameras. Every other camera we've purchased has come with a base to set on our charger/download base but this one didn't. I hate keeping track of cords and trying to tell the difference between all of them!", "Date": "December 28, 2010"}, {"Title": "Cute on Outside", "Author": "SuperMom", "ReviewID": "R3G8LSKA2SJ7RV", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "I purchased the Kodak Easyshare M530 because my daughter was graduating from high school and I wanted to capture the moments of the last bird leaving the nest. Well those memories were almost lost. I thought I can't go wrong with KODAK; they've been around for years. But I did. The buttons were to close together, the pictures came out dark, the zoom in shots came out blurred. It was the camera from H--L. I even tried to talk myself into keeping it, because I felt bad about returning it, but the more I used it the more I became unhappy with my purchase. What I will tell you is that I purchased a Polaroid for daughter on Amazon at the same time and only paid $60.00 for it and it worked like the most expensive camera I have ever owned beautiful, colorful pictures. That camera saved the memories I almost lost because of the KODAK. Don't judge a camera by the price and the maker.

The pictures that come out are okay, but it has to be of a subject that is still.  So I bought this camera for the purpose of taking pictures of my 2 kids...  So it does not provide me with what I need, because it is rare that you can get 2 kids to hold still long enough to get a good shot.  It also does not always focus on what you need.  It picks up the closest thing and that is what the camera will focus on.I have been happy with all of my Nikon point and shoot cameras, and will not purchase another Kodak one because of this.  I just want a simple camera that I can count on to take the picture that I want when I push the button, without spending too much money on it.  The Nikon cameras hold up to that.  I was just trying to be more environmentally friendly with this camera and the rechargeable battery in it.", "Date": "October 26, 2010"}, {"Title": "bad unless you have bright light and no movement", "Author": "Noah's Mom", "ReviewID": "R2JJ7I1FPWCH00", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I bought this camera for my son for Christmas, he said he had to have a green camera so we were limited on choices.  He likes it because it is green and small.  I feel like I wasted my money, because unless you have total bright light and whatever you are taking a picture of is so still to the point it is not even breathing - the picture quality is horrible.  Every picture is blurred.  And for a seven year old, either he is moving or what he is taking a picture of is moving.
