{"Reviews": [{"Title": "A wonderful entry-level camera", "Author": "S. Wachi \"swachi\"", "ReviewID": "R16NJTRETPYFDD", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This camera is a joy to use.  It has a solid feel to it, with the grip housing the CF card and 4AA batteries - the weight is just right for casual shooting (common CCDs take longer exposure time than regular films, so jittering is an issue with smaller cameras). The camera looks well built, and has a mature, understated, and attractive design to it.  (Everything on it has a purpose, like a dot near the flash to prevent flash from being covered by a finger; even the bezel around the zoom lens, which screws off to reveal a lens adapter socket!)  None of the components (especially the battery/CF compartment) looks or feels flimsy - all the switches operate smoothly.  The case has no jagged edges and sensible rectangular shape, so it'll fit in your pocket confortably.  LCD is bright, colorful, and large enough.  Viewfinder is, well, useable, but you won't be using this unless you want to save battery.Zooming is a little slow, but this is not an issue with this price tag.It is very robust.  AA NiMH rechargeables, while not included, are cheap, reliable, long-lasting, and very easy to replace (you can just have a set of cheap alkaline battery as a spare).  Don't get Ni-Cd - it's useless.  I've dropped the camera once already, but to my amazement, everything works perfectly.Picture quality is great.  It is more than adequate for most of the purposes - and it is great to experiment on shots before you commit to shooting with film.  This will allow me to refine my composition skills.  I do recommend getting 128MB CF card ($40-50 nowadays), which will definitely last you a good day or two, with 177 to1417 (high to low resolution) shots!The camera has a lot of very useful functions, such as slow-synchro, timer, color-balance (very good compensation for fluorescent and tungsten light), image rotation, etc., etc.  Stich-assist and included software is wonderful, as you can recreate the panoramic scene when viewed by QuicktimeVR.  It sounds like a toy, but I'm certain you will be impressed by the effect it has on you.Both PC and Macs are supported, and Mac software is decent.  I have no complaints.  It'll be perfect if you already own Photoshop and/or ImageConverter (the latter being absolutely a top-notch batch image-conversion shareware).If I had any complaint, it is the warm-up time:  You need to hold the power button for fully 3-4 seconds until the camera is turned on and ready to shoot.  I'd trade lens zoom (which is not impressive anyway) with a faster startup - it'll be even more useful that way.  Also, a way to set up timer length would have been easy to implement without additional cost (or a remote via USB, but that's ok)Canon really meant the A10 to be a lean, versatile, mature product - it has all the functions a non-professional user can ask for, coupled with a well-thought out layout and a solid construction.  Smart thing is that A10 and A20's accessories are compatible - I'm thinking of getting the wide-angle lens adapter, water-proof casing, and dye-sub printer.  This thing *will* adapt to your lifestyle and won't cramp you with proprietary components and gimmicks (unlike A20's mostly useless TV output)!", "Date": "February 2, 2002"}, {"Title": "Excellent value camera", "Author": "Simon Forsyth \"Old timer IT guy, researcher.\"", "ReviewID": "RTYV4ID99MRSU", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "After spending a bucket of money on my 35mm camera for development, I decided to bite the bullet and go digital. We have a number of digital cameras in our department including an Olympus 3MegaPixel and an Agfa 1.2MegaPixel. When using images for high quality printing the 3MPix was great, but the 1.2MPix produced wonderful screen images, more than adequate for web page and small printed sections (@300dpi you get 4\"x3\"). I wasn't going to be printing pics so I considered 1.2MPix enough for me.Looking around at the various reviews it was obvious that Canon had put a lot of work into image compression speed, data transfer rate, and battery life. Combined with Canon's excellent quality optics ... well, this is the one I had to have.I rushed out and bought a 256Meg compact flash card, for the long tours I occasionally do. I've taken 550 images in the first two weeks and I'm on the second set of batteries, the camera reports it can hold another 150 more! I could double that if I increased the image compression to \"normal\" mode. The image quality is just wonderful ~ 1280x960, bigger than my screen.Only gripe is the view finder that you look through has a hard time showing the boundaries of the image, just a matter of getting used to it. Sure, I could use the LCD display to take the image (and I do on some close ups) but it drains batteries. Doing a wide mix of display use and flash, the supplied alkaline batteries lasted 260 shots ~ way beyond the Olympus and Agfa achieved.And with zero development cost, I've done heaps of photographic experimenting that I would never have even considered with a 35mm just because of the cost of film and development.So, YES, I highly recommend this camera. Also get some NiMH batteries and a charger, a dinky camera bag, and a big compact flash card (maybe 256Meg was a bit too much, 64Meg or 128Meg would have done the job nicely).", "Date": "March 7, 2002"}, {"Title": "Get this camera!!", "Author": "Link", "ReviewID": "R3V0ZBO9PILC3E", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I did a lot of searching on the internet at all types of digicams and reviews just like this one.  This camera didn't have a single bad review from any websites that I could find.  And I wrote down every feature a digicam can have and checked off features for every camera I looked at.  This camera had the most features, the best reviews, and a great price tag.  I now own the camera and only after a few days, I've realized I made the perfect choice because it offers so much and is so easy to use.  I think every digicam out there should have the dial on it because it makes it so easy to sue...and a lot of cameras do have this feature.  The quality of the pictures is all I was worried about because its only 1.3 megapixels...well, I'm VERY impressed with the image quality!!! all my shots are very clear and crisp.  As for anything negative, only that the batteries seem to run out fast, but I think it may just be the batteries because I got some cheapy rechargeables that came with my camera carrying case.  Also, I recomend getting a 32 or 64 MB card with the camera becuase the 8MB gets you about 20-25 pictures on high resolution.This camera is a must get camera in the price range its in, I seriously doubt any other camera can compare to this one in the price range around (dollar amount).One last comment, I can't believe how easy the camera AND software are to use....the software does almost everything by itself and the camera is so easy to use that it makes taking pictures perfectly so much fun!!", "Date": "December 14, 2001"}, {"Title": "I love this camera!!", "Author": "Casey2431", "ReviewID": "R2M6BT2C24E8MW", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I've had every kind of camera in the past, and finally decided to try digital. I thought it would be a \"fun\" camera to have for certain situations, but didn't have high expectations for the picture quality. I have to say that this camera has exceeded my expectations!! The picture quality is great and I like being able to edit the color, brightness and contrast with the included Canon software. I just received the camera and took a total of 34 pictures over 2 days, with the LCD turned on for most of them. We looked at the pictures on the LCD 3-4 times and downloaded 18 of them to the computer from the camera and the batteries are still going strong. I went out yesterday and bought an external card reader to download from and that works super too. This camera is a bargain at $...! I highly recommend it!

I've taken tons of pics & always hated waiting to finish the roll, & then to wait & go have it developed. Most of my photos wound up being scanned & posted on the internet. So I firgured a digital camera would be better. I did a lot of searching & reading the reveiws of others about their purchases.I bought the A10 for several reasons: 1)The name Canon. 2)I didn't need the movie mode. 3)Takes 4 AA batteries. 4)I wasn't worried about the 1.3 pixels since I don't print my images. (The A10s image is better than a sharp 35mm pic after it has been scanned)The software to download was simple & the operation of the camera is easy to learn.I use the LCD screen very little, the optical viewfinder is perfect. The viewfinder zooms in & out with the lens.My very 1st image turned out great! I've owned the A10 a week now & LOVE it!

The most noticable difference is the ability to zoom (optically, rather than digitally) on the subject.  This camera takes great pics and has a good battery life.  It came with a substantial owners guide; however the camera is really easy to learn.  It's also good looking and built solid.  My only gripe is not being able to view the pics on a TV, as with the HP.  If you need this feature, you can buy the A20 for a little more cost.  One suggestion:  Buy a memory card reader for $20 to go with the camera.  You can have immediate access to your pics, without the delay of uploading them.", "Date": "December 5, 2001"}, {"Title": "For the AARP Generation!", "Author": "Evelyn Minx", "ReviewID": "R3PIL48GHO057E", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Being somewhat intimidated by the digital world, I was somewhat apprehensive about purchasing my first digital camera.

I want to explain what this camera (or any digital camera) has in common with a Barbie doll. The Barbie doll itself is not that expensive. But once you buy it, you will want all the accessories -- Ken, Barbie's Dream House, her sportscar, clothes -- and that's what puts a ding in your wallet. Same here. You will love the camera. But you will need to buy the AC adapter and Amazon doesn't carry it. (Try TechDepot.) The batteries will croak very quickly if you use them to power the camera while it is connected to a PC or a notebook. Invest in a charger and rechargeable batteries. The camera comes with a mingy 8MB Compact Flash card. You will want a 64MB card, at the very least. Not to mention a camera case! I recommend the camera highly.

I do notecards and other things and sell them locally.  I was looking for something that I could use when I am hiking or travelling to take low resolution photos to send to friends as e-mail attachments or to make photo quality 4X6 and the occassional 5X7 print, or for note cards.  This camera is really great.  I don't use the LCD, so I get 712 photos on a 64 MB flash card.  It still shows an image for about 2-3 seconds after you shoot, just to make sure the photo is OK and you don't have to reshoot.  I also got a flash card reader to connect to my USB port so I don't have to use the camera to download.  I just remove the flashcard, stick it in the reader and download.  The zoombrowser software is great.  I can file photos by lake or village or date or trip or whatever way I want.  For the money, this camera gives me the greatest bang for the buck I ever got in a camera.  The images I send on the internet are beautiful.  Everyone that gets them comments on them.  If this thing had a hot shoe for using a bigger flash and a dial to switch back and forth quickly between resolution settings so I could take one at high for prints and the same photo at low for e-mail, this camera would be perfect for my purposes.

The picture quality is great, I have printed out pictures and they look just like ones from a 35mm camera.  The only draw back for this camera is if you want prints over 4X6.  It only has 1.3MP which limits picture size to only the 4X6, but the quality of those prints is great.  If you are looking for a digital camera that gets great quality photos for posting on the net or sending to friends via email and want to print out a few of you favorites at the 4X6 size, then I recommend this camera highly.  Another great feature is that it has 3x optical zoom which is not included on most cameras in this price range.  Digital zoom is a complete waste(as it is on every digital camera, but the optical zoom is really great.  You will be more pleased with a digital camera which has 3x optical zoom instead of 2.1MP for this price.

This fine piece by Canon is an exercise in simplicity and quality.  While only 1.3 megapixels, it yields photos better than some other cameras with 2-3 megapixels.  I don't know why.  So easy to use!  With a 3 year old grandson, I take a lot of photos.  I mean a lot of photos.  I would guess this camera has saved me its cost ...3-4 times in what I would have paid for film & processing.  You, of course, need a computer and printer.  It comes with only an 8 megabyte Compact Flash card (the \"film\") so belly up for something bigger right away.  I just bought a 128 MB card.  Don't forget that this \"film\" is reusable after you download to you desktop.  As I said, I have seven other film cameras.  None of them is as easy to use as this Canon.  And the Canon shots are as good as anything else I shoot, except for the enlargability of my medium format Yashica.  And imagine being able to review the shot you just took without the expense of a Polaroid.

While this A10 may be an entry level model, it is also in many ways their very best value. It is well built and sturdy enough, not too large to carry easily in a purse (and in fact a bit easier to grip than are the Elph models, therefore making it easier to hold steady), and offers enough adjustable features for 99% of the digital photo takers whom I know. Happily, it will also function nicely in the automatic mode for folks who just want to point and shoot. The combination of an optical 3X zoom plus a 1.3 megapixel resolution is where I think most users will find their \"sweet spot\" in digicams. The 3X zoom is powerful enough to make itself useful in many non-portrait settings (sightseeing, sports, etc.) and the 1.3 megapixel resolution is more than adequate for computer viewing and storage, emailing, website posting and adequate for printing crystal clear enlargements up to 5\" x 7\" (and with acceptable results on 8\" x 10\" prints). Of course, the A10 offers all the expected niceties, such as easy connectability to your PC, good battery options (including disposables and rechargeables) and an almost infinitely expandable memory. Then there is the price; certainly the A10 is down in the APS range. This then is what I would call perfect digicam for the masses, a \"volkskamera\".
