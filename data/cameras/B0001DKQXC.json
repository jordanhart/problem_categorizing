I chose it because of the 4 megapixel quality and my prior use of its film cousin. I rate it four stars because it isn't a professional level camera- though it is very good for casual shooting and \"memory\" photos.What I like: I love the compactness of this camera! This camera alives in a small carry-case with three spare batteries and a flat holder with three spare 1 MB xD cards, and some lens paper. (The TV and PC connecting cables, small charger and cord, with appropriate adapters, go in my carry-on stuff.) I also love the dust- and water-resistance of this camera. In typical Stylus build, it has protective gaskets for every opening - and I have used this camera in gear-jamming dusty locations as well as very moist ones (Iguaz\u00fa Falls, salt water small boat cruising.) It's taken very good scenics (including really nice sunsets) and people photos. It is fairly quick as long as I have pre-focused, and I am only taking one or two photos (always at high quality.) The software allows you to \"stitch\" several photos together for a panoramic view, and its convenient compactness feels good when I am visiting where tourists with flashy cameras are targets for thievery and muggery. When it is closed in its self-contained \"clamshell\", it fits discreetly in my pocket. What don't I like? The menu system, if you want to use it to its maximum capability, can be exasperatingly counter-intuitive and arcane. The extensible lens, when extended to its maximum length, can be subject to distortion if you press against it. This camera is NOT for anyone who needs telephoto (sports or wildlife? get a digicam with 10x OPTICAL zoom - NEVER use the \"digital zoom\" feature on any digital camera, disable it!) The screen can be difficult to see in bright conditions - use the viewfinder, disable the screen (which will also save battery energy,) realizing the photo will show a bit more than the finder will and leaving you a little cropping room. It also can get expensive when you buy extra batteries and large-capacity proprietary xD cards, but then when I compare it with many rolls of film, processing and knowing what I have only when I'm back from the trip, not to mention reusinig the batteries and cards, you will save lots of money if you take lots of photos like I do. Remember that even without a telephoto, camera motion is your enemy - practice breath control and squ-e-e-ze the shutter release, brace the camera - carry a folding table tripod, use a table, wall or chair as a base in low light conditions. I've got some unforgettable (and sharp!) sunsets, Eiffel Tower at night, etc. with my plastic folding angle-leg table tripod or pressing the camera against a lamppost, using this camera.I scuba dive, and have even taken this camera to 125 - 130 feet in its Lexan housing and taken some reasonable underwater photos (you will want an aftermarket accessory strobe for decent color rendition if you go deeper than, say, thirty feet.)For someone who travels and subjects cameras to varied environmental conditions, but wants a nice, compact, easy to use digital camera that will give you a decent 11 x 14 or under photo of people and scenics, I heartily recommend this camera.", "Date": "May 31, 2004"}, {"Title": "Outstanding camera for the value!", "Author": "leelee", "ReviewID": "RTPWQSX8222NO", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Ok, I see there have been some disgruntled users. This is an outstanding ultracompact AND weatherproof camera for the money! Tiny and fits in a woman's palm. I've carried it in my purse due to it's ultracompact size. As a longtime Canon and Nikon 35mm SLR user, the compact digital point and shoot cameras are not perfect. I really resisted going compact digital but carrying around a 35mm SLR can be weighty and inconvenient. Unless you wish to spend $999 or more, the 410 is a great stand-in. This camera takes superb pictures even in low light. All digital point and shoots will have some difficulty in low light conditions. This is why external flash units are available...even 35mm SLR's need addl lighting depending on shooting conditions! Yes, the flash is rather bright but with PC editing features this is easily remedied...better to have too bright a flash than weak flash. Remember nothing can be done regarding undercompensation. I did not find any significant delay time. Olympus designers also did a terrific job with the look and feel of Stylus 410. Show me a better looking camera on the market! The all-metal body and cover offer excellent protection. It weighs 5.8 oz. Just pick up a LowePro D-Res 8M weather resistant and fitted camera case ($12.75 at Amazon vendor Adorama Camera) and you are ready to go. This case is specially form-fitted for Olympus 410 and allows carry of (1) extra battery or memory card. Super small bag with shoulder strap. I have never owned an Olympus and did extensive research prior to purchase. I borrowed a friend's 300 Stylus and that is also a darned good camera for the money.If you are not a professional photographer and just need to take some vacation pics - this is a best buy. You should really not need more than 3-4 megapixels if you are taking 4x6 vacation pics as photo quality is very high. Even 5x7 photo quality is extremely good. Higher megapixels such as 6.0 will yield better looking 8x10's but how many of us really regularly shoot 8x10 photos? Otherwise, invest in a 35mm digital SLR (hint: Canon Digital Rebel - got one and love it!). Another good camera for the $ is Nikon Coolpix 3200 with 3.2 megapixels.", "Date": "July 21, 2004"}, {"Title": "There is no delay", "Author": "Robert Goulding", "ReviewID": "RZNVIZUY2ZPBR", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "The people that say that the delay do not know how to use a camera.  Usually, when I buy an expensive piece of equipment like this, I like to know how to use it.  There is only a negligible delay when taking pictures.  These people are just mashing the shutter button at the moment they want to take the picture.  This exactly what you are NOT supposed to do.  The delay they are getting is from the camera focusing.  What they should do is hold the button half way down, which focuses on the subject, then they just need to push it the rest of the way when the time is right.  They will then have a picture of exactly what they wanted.  Those reviews should be disregarded.", "Date": "May 18, 2004"}, {"Title": "Great line of cameras - lots of misinformed users!", "Author": null, "ReviewID": "RV1QLT7SSD09Y", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Have a 300 Stylus and tested a 410, will buy one soon.  Lots of myths out there:- Never buy a camera that uses non-rechargeable batteries (i.e. AA).  You'll go through piles of them with even light usage.  They'll die just when you need more.  Why is it so hard to simply recharge your Li-ion battery more often than letting it run down to zero?  - I know it so hard to be inconvenienced, but you have to press the shutter down so the camera can focus.  If you're on a strange angle or poor lighting, the camera just won't take the shot - it's trying to focus during that time and conks out.  Anyone who wants \"instant\" shutter snaps needs to return to analog film.  - Skin tone is hard to get with any flash camera unless it's professional.  The Olympus flash does tend to be rather bright, I must admit.  But I'd rather have brighter (can adjust later with some editing software) than too dark (can't do anything.)- Who wants all this extra bulky photo editing software?  I just want to plug the camera into my computer's USB slot and download the photos without all this baby-handholding \"editing software\" that comes with other cameras.  Only the Olympus allows you to do that.  If you're at someone's house or at work or wherever, you can download right to their computer.  Can't do it with others if they don't have the editing software CD.Beats Fuji and Canon, this camera.", "Date": "June 16, 2004"}, {"Title": "Overal I love the camera- great item for the price :)", "Author": "Girleen \"girleengirl\"", "ReviewID": "R2L7PPFBX7M14A", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I would have to say this is one of the best purchases I've made this year. I bring this camera everywhere. Its not as easy to use as the Olympus D-580 4MP Digital Camera with 3x Optical Zoom but its better in the sense that battery is rechargeable. I returned the Olympus D-580 because it was using up too many batteries. I had to switch batteries after 30 or so shots. But the picture quality at night doesn't measure to that of the D-580. I would have given this camera a 5 star if the picture quality was comparable to the cheaper D-580. But other than that I love everything about the camera. Its fun and cheap for a college student like myself who likes taking random pictures.As for the time delay, well that's when the camera is focusing. I do have a problem with it as well but its not as noticeable as some have made it out to be. You just have to hold and freeze for a little while.  At times this can be bothersome but for the price what can you say?? I don't mind saving money on this feature because I'm not using this camera to take pictures of little children or fast moving animals.Indoor pictures are terrible- even with the correct setting indoor pictures do not measure up to those taken with the D-580. I find that with indoor pictures, one gets the best pictures if it is totally dark but if there is lighting then the picture comes out darker. The best pictures I've been able to take with this camera were those taken outside. In June I took a picture outside and I was able to blow the picture up to a big 20 X 30 poster and it came out beautiful. I've blown up many poster size pictures but I've had the best result with the Olympus 410.I've used this camera to take pictures of documents as well. Sometimes professors post answers to exams on the walls and whenever I didn't feel like copying down the answers I just took a picture of the documents and I was able to read the words when I uploaded the pictures onto my computer. The things you can do with this camera is endless. Having a digital camera is very handy. If you take it to lab, you can take pictures of the organ being studied and then review it for your next lab. Its very handy.Overall I would have to say I love having this camera. I was able to do many things with little effort. for the price this camera is a bargain. Even if I had the extra money I don't think I would get a bulkier camera for better quality pictures. I like the size and the look of the camera.

I use it for snapping photos around campus and on outdoor adventures.  The 410 takes quality photos outside, but inside is a different story.  When the light is good, and flash is not required, the photos come out very well.  When flash is required, people often complain about how bright it is--and how much more brighter it is than other cameras.  The flash also makes the photos turn out horribly, in some instances.If you need a digital camera for outdoors/recreational use, the 410 should suit you well.  Not only does the camera take excellent outdoor photos, it also makes reds and blues more radiant.  I look forward to boating and canoeing this summer!

Its easy to figure out how to use, and the pictures it takes are gorgeous. It uses a standard SD memory card, which are also fairly inexpensive. As for the picture delay that others complain about, its not even a problem for me...meaning ive never noticed it. Its super-macro setting allowes you to take super detailed close up shots that turn out great if you can hold still enough.

Compared to other 3 and 4 megapixel cameras at that time, I thought that the 300 was very good.  My big complaint was the delay from the time that you press the button to take the picture to the time that the camera actually takes the picture.  I timed this delay and it is a full 2 seconds.  When I saw that the Digital Stylus 410 claimed to have a 30% faster processing time, I thought that I found a fix.  I just got the 410 and it still has the same delay.  In fact, if anything, it takes longer for the 410 to take a picture from the time that you push the button to the time that the camera actually takes the picture.  This is especially disappointing, not only because they market that they have improved this issue, but also because other manufactures have implemented new processors that actually do fix this delay problem.  Looks like the 410 is going back :-(Other than this complaint, the 410 is generally a good camera.  That is why I gave it a 3.

I keep it in a dry box while running rapids, take it out to take photos or movies of other people running the same rapid. Issue number one is photo quality. It's not near as good as my Canon Powershot A80. With the Canon, I can use my software to zoom in much more on shots before the image gets pixelized. (Both are 4 megapixel cameras.) The Canon's focusing system also handles action shots much better, as well as low light conditions. Issue number two is that the battery door can easily be flicked open by an inadvertent finger movement. I was shooting a photo and grazed the door with my thumb and the battery dropped in my lap (fortunately not the water). Issue number 3, it is hard to set the mode for picture taking using the software and screen. They could have designed it to be easier to read in bright conditions.

It won't be bothered by a little rain or snow, or the splash of a dolphin.  I am impressed with how well this little camera is put together, with a solid metal case, yet still very compact and light-weight.  The controls are logical and simple to use.  I'm not a big fan of proprietary batteries (you cannot just toss in a pair of Duracells in a pinch), but it seems necessary to achieve this compact size.  This camera would be perfect for a lady who wants to keep in her purse, glove box, briefcase, etc., to be handy for all occasions.  It is not a camera for the serious photographer though.  Picture quality is generally very good, but clearly not as good as the Olympus C-770 for example.  The image can be a little noisy in low light, for example on cloudy days, grass will lack sharpness and end up looking like a big mass of green.  The flash is on the weak side too (good for 12 feet at best), and you cannot add a more powerful one.  The 32MB memory card is adequate only if you reduce capture mode to say 1.2 MP size (1280 x 960), otherwise you'll want a bigger card.  The Stylus is made for someone who just wants to point and shoot with good results, which means it's perfect for some people, but I would only consider it as a second camera to have the go-anywhere portability, or backup camera for a more serious amateur photographer.

But there is no perfect camera, so you have to decide what is most important to you. This is my third Olympus camera, I had a D490, a C750 and now a Stylus 410. I am now more of a Olympus fan than ever. Because Olympus gives me what is most important to me, sharp, clear photos with good color quality. They are slightly behind Nikon on skin tone. But ahead of most cameras companys when it coems to sharp, clear, photos with good rich color. This is a small camera though, and it does not have all the features that it's big brother has. Of course, it would be pretty silly to use this camera for sports, so there really is no reason to put a sports mode on it. What it does best is get up close and personal and the stylus takes good photos of people. You could even get a fair photo of your house. It is good enough for a small camera, but I am looking forward to Olympus coming out with the flat camera with the big screen on the back. I may well be the first one in line for the AZ-1 when it comes out in this country. In the mean time, my wife is happy with the little 410 stylus, so it should work out just fine for us. Just don't expect me to give up my C750 for this little guy. Unless I am at a party and I can get up close.

When you hold the camera to take a pic, if it just touches the slide, it turns the camera off and you have to restart the thing all over again.  It seems to always happen when I ask other people to take pics with it.Also, the pics are nice and enlarge well, but if it is low light, the pics are orange and blurry- even with the flash and night setting turned on.I loved the weater resistant feature, though and I have dropped it more than once and it fires back to life each time.

Any battery can go bad, even rechargable lithiums (all it takes is one out of the three to die and you're out of business). I'm a big fan of rechargable AA batteries. Take two sets with you on vacation and if something goes wrong, drop into a drug store and buy replacements until you can find more rechargables. I have, however, found that Olympus makes the best digital cameras I've ever used. The D-550 3-megapixil is superb and it uses AA batteries. One of its best features is in the Camedia software that comes with it. It corrects for the distortion found in ALL single lens digital cameras. If Olympus goes to propriatary batteries, they've lost me as a customer. I don't want to be out in the middle of nowhere and suddenly have my battery go down. Nor do I want to find out, three years from now, that my battery is special order only and goes for an exorbitant price. I've got a laptop computer by Lexmark in my closet that I could still be using, except the proprietary battery's no longer being made.Finally, while the Olympus Stylus 410 4MP Digital Camera renders very nice photos, it has minor annoyances like \"noise\" -- digital interference that pros can spot as coming from a digital camera. In low light, it also suffers from a slight purple cast in dark areas, neither of which my D-550 has.After batteries, quality of photos is my next big buying point. This camera is capable of taking great photos that are frameible, but you'll have to add Photoshop Elements to the purchase to boost saturation and change color casts. The camera's the right size.

I gave it 4 stars only because it is an older camera with lower megapixels by today's standards; but even so, it's big on features, and it can take some fabulous pictures.This camera is very hardy and rugged, light and very compact, yet if feels solid in your hands. I keep it with me all the time, throwing it in my purse to take it down the street or across the country. It is dinged up, scratched, and slightly dented, but it just keeps going. Living in the Sacramento valley, I have also subjected it to some fairly extreme conditions -- from Tahoe snow to over 100 degrees F in the summer. It even fell in the water on a boating trip, and it's still going strong.I chose this camera because of its many features. I especially wanted the option for video with sound, and originally thought I'd only be taking snapshots of people with it. However, this camera can do so much more. It has several condition settings, such as Beach+Snow for bright sun, Landscape, Landscape+Portrait, Portrait, Indoors, and even a Cuisine setting for food! I've also had fun with the Macro and Super Macro settings. For the ambitious and creative, you can vary the White Balance and Exposure Value for indoors, outdoors, and different lighting conditions. It also has a Stitch Panorama setting (for taking multiple photos of a wide or tall scene and stitching them together with Olympus software), and you can record sound with a picture. It will also shoot multiple frames at about 3 fps. The zoom range on it is decent -- you can take pix of landscapes yet still get rather close for action.After two years, I have pretty much maxed out this camera's abilities and will be upgrading to the Canon EOS 40D.
