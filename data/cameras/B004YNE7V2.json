{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Lumix FH24K - Thick For A Compact Camera, But Feature Packed with Great Image Quality", "Author": "Mark \"Technology, Music and Movies\"", "ReviewID": "RMBABDKSQIFC1", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "The Panasonic DMC-FH24K 16.1MP Digital Camera with 8x Wide Angle Image Stabilized Zoom and 2.7 inch LCD is a very capable update to their compact ultra-zoom product family.  While it doesn't have the full HD video capabilities of the FX series, it does provide high resolution, large format photography and above average optical zoom.  It is not as svelte as the Canon PowerShot ELPH 300 HS 12.1 MP Digital Camera, but it provides very good picture quality and a tremendous value in a compact camera.PROS:++ 28mm Leica DC Vario-Elmar lens provides great picture quality with wide-angle versatility++ Advertised 8x optical zoom scales up to 10x on my camera before switching to digital++ Extremely strong flash for a compact camera++ Some of the best face detection I have seen on any compact camera++ Handy 70 MB built-in memory provides emergency storage and a nice buffer for multiple pictures++ Convenient \"E.Zoom\" button for quickly zooming in and out++ Good size for taking it with you in your pocket or purse++ Metal front plate is attractive and durable++ Intuitive button controls including manual exposure adjustment++ Improved Intelligent Auto (iA) mode works quickly and enables motion detection and image stabilization++ Motion detection & IS can also be enabled manually for scene modes++ Two new iA functions: AF (Auto Focus) Tracking and Intelligent Exposure++ Venus VI Engine with noise reduction++ 2.7\" TFT-LCD with multiple display settings++ Quick charging compact battery++ Image stabilization (MEGA O.I.S.) & shake detection++ Digital AV out connection with hinged cover++ Tripod mount hole is deep & on the left to allow easy access to your memory & battery++ 720p HD movie mode++ 28 scene modes for many situations (I am still learning these)++ A frequently used scene mode setting can be stored & accessed via \"My Scene Mode\"++ Great value given all the featuresCONS:-- While still compact, not as thin as other compacts such as the Canon Elph 300-- Zoom does not seem to work in HD video record mode (not yet sure if this is a product limitation or a defect with my specific camera)-- Inefficient picture deletion requires too many steps in review mode-- Video recording is accessed via a camera mode setting, which is counter intuitive-- No electronic or lens view-finder-- Many competing alternatives provide larger screens (3 inches and up) & touch control-- Flash may be too strong for some, blinding people when taking close up evening portraits-- Steep learning curve for mastery (for example, burst is in the Q menu instead of Mode)CONCLUSIONThis is a good camera with accessible controls and features.  The screen is not as big as those on other cameras, but it is clear and useful.  And this camera produces very good quality pictures.  That key strength makes this a good value for my needs.

I could not be happier.  I have a great camera from Nikon that I love, but it is big and bulky and I rarely take it with me anywhere.  That defeats the purpose of having a camera.  So I decided to look for a small point and shoot and the reviews for this camera were astounding.  Mostly 4-5 stars and trust me, they were not wrong.  I have owned a few point and shoots and this one tops them all.  The intelligent auto is incredible.  I have played around with the settings and have take pictures adjusting the settings to what I thought was best and then took a picture allowing the intelligent auto to do the work...yup, the intelligent auto shots looked better.  The camera really does all the work.

If you're looking for a point and shoot camera then this is a nice place to start. My pictures were very bright and vibrant. With close up shots you can see people's pores (I kid you not). The night shots with the flash are clear which is great and the daytime ones are nice as well. I bought this camera because camera phone pics quite frankly suck, and I just needed a basic camera that took decent pics so I can have memories:) This camera fulfilled my needs. The only thing I don't like about the camera is the software it comes with. PHOTOfunSTUDIO is not fun!!!!. I enjoy manipulating photos then sending them to friends and family as a card, or for a laugh so I like software that is not only user friendly, but has a ton of options. PHOTOfunSTUDIO is neither. It's really bland. Good enough to get pics from the camera but thats about it. Thanks to the internet, you're not forced to use this software if you're like me.

Thanks to the reviews on Amazon I was able to narrow my search down to this camera series.Great point and shoot camera for people like myself who want excellent pics without becoming an expert or reading the manual.8X optical zoom is every good, except it is a bit jerky during adjustment.Image stabilization in the IA mode works well esp when taking pictures of my son who can't stay still.IA mode also switches to macro mode automatically when needed.Face tracking for auto-focus is great and will track more than one face or object.Low light pics are good without flash.Menu is not difficult to learn (without manual). Basic functions require just one or two steps (button pushes.With the timer and tripod mount I can take family pictures without dad usually missing. :)I have a good camera (12mp) with flash in my phone. But it has no timer, red eye reduction, macro mode and can't be mounted on a tripod.I bought this camera to sell some of my coin collection on Ebay. These are expensive coins and I have been able to get great pictures without a lot of trial and error. I've been getting top dollar for the coins because the pictures are clear and detail is excellent.Very pleased with this camera. It has a lot more features that I have not listed. I see no need to upgrade this camera for many years.You will need to buy a flash memory card. I strongly suggest you get a good quality high speed card. SDHC class 10. Check the reviews before you buy the card. With a fast card you can take good video as well as little or no delay between still shots without flash.This is not the touch screen model.Wait for this to go on sale.

Worked fine up until we got to the island, then the screen didn't work at all.  Thus, no honeymoon pictures from the good camera...Called Panasonic, which put me on hold for half an hour.  They told me to go to their website, follow the instructions, and print a form.  The website had no form or instructions.Called them again only to get put on hold for half an hour again.  This time I reached their India call center.  Keep in mind this was their tech service line.  The lady asked me what she could help me with.  I said \"I have a broken camera.\"  Her response, \"what would  you like ME to do about your broken camera?\"  Ok, thanks for nothing.  What do you think I'm calling the tech service line for when I have a broken camera...maybe so you can tell me what I need to do to replace it!?  In the end, she simply gave me an address to mail the camera to.  No forms, no warranty info, nothing...I'll be surprised if I ever see that camera or my money again.Needless to say, if Panasonic values supporting it's customers by not helping them at all and outsourcing the \"help\" to India, I'm more than happy to \"support\" them by giving them bad reviews and never buying their products again.Hope you don't have issues if you buy this product...", "Date": "June 20, 2012"}, {"Title": "amazing", "Author": "miguel.

Each photograph, especially those where I've aimed into any kind of light source, have hazy white lines in the center of the photo. I couldn't figure out how I could have scratched the lens since the cover retracts automatically when it's not on. I am very careful with my camera and keep it in a lens case when being carried around. A little research turned this up: http://www.amazon.co.uk/Lens-scratches/forum/Fx39Y385WF8RDUQ/Tx1ZBKB3Z7Z73R8/1?_encoding=UTF8&asin;=B001T0H0RG. Apparently lots of other people have had this this issue. The scratches are due to a defect in the camera shutter which scratches the lens each time it closes. When I listen closely I can hear it making contact with the glass. I called Panasonic and spoke to Otis, a supervisor in their Camera Repair dept. and, as expected, he told me that I'd have to return it for repair at a cost of $128. He said \"defect or not, it's out of warranty\". And that's that. I will not be returning it for repair at that cost, of course.
