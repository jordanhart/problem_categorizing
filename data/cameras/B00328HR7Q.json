{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Good Party Camera, Full HD video", "Author": "Photo-Am \"Vlad\"", "ReviewID": "R11KZQ1XZ1BJZ9", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I've got my Sony DSC-TX7 from Amazon just a few days ago. First impression - it's very small and thin. Feels very solid and a dark blue color looks pretty good. A wrist strap has been already attached at the factory; otherwise it can easily slip out of your hands. It is pretty good for a party - you can put it into your pocket and do whatever you want, even dance, and this camera will not bother you with its presence.PROS:- Very attractive stylish and solid design, especially in dark-blue color- Ultra-slim body fits any small pocket- Dust-free optics since the lens is not retractable- Big high-resolution 920K colorful display looks like a small TV- Pretty short startup time, no shutter lag, up to 10 frames per sec in burst mode- Accepts SD/SDHC memory cards as well as Sony's proprietary memory-stick cards- Wide 25mm (equiv.) lens - good for indoors and parties- High-precision auto focus and effective image stabilization- Sophisticated noise reduction algorithm greatly improves high-ISO pictures quality- Advanced Hand-held Twilight mode for low-light pictures- Special Backlight Correction HDR mode for high-contrast scenes- Wide auto-stitch panorama mode- High-quality front-side stereo microphones- Smooth and silent zoom, auto focus, and optical image stabilization- Very nice Full High-Definition 1080 60i video- Unusually good video quality and high sensitivity in VGA mode- Intuitive well-thought-out menu with the easy to use touch-screenCONS:- New \"Exmor R\" sensor seems much faster but more noisy than CCD ones- Aggressive noise reduction is prone to obliterate small picture details- Relatively short battery life and slow chargerBUILD: The build quality is very good and I generally like its construction. The only issue is the shifting of the lens cover to turn camera on and off - that mechanism is pretty tight but the lens cover does not have any kind of prominence you could grasp to move that resisting shield up and down.STARTUP: The startup time is pretty short - about 1 sec. The time of recording of a single picture into the memory card might vary from 1 to 2 sec without flash and about 2 sec with flash. In the burst mode you can take 10 shots for just 1 sec but then you should wait for about 10 sec while they're being writing to the memory. The menu provides a friendly interface to manage those groups of shots.DISPLAY: TX7 has a big 3.5\" bright high-resolution display with 920K pixels and a wide angle of view which is easily visible even in a direct sunlight. With its vivid colors and clarity it looks like a small TV with a 16:9 wide-screen.MENU: Most of the camera's functionality is accessible via that touch-screen display. TX7 has a very intuitive menu which is visually divided into 3 parts - narrow left and right vertical bars and a big central area. On the top of the right bar you can see the remaining battery charge indicator, available number of pictures, current shooting format and resolution. In the lower part there are the two buttons: Shooting Mode and Playback. If you touch the mode button a list of the available modes will appear in the central part: Intelligent Auto, Program Auto, iSweep Panorama, Movie, Anti Motion Blur, Hand-held Twilight, Backlight Correction HDR, and Scenes.The left navigation bar has a \"Menu\" button on the top with 4 predefined icons below. It you touch that \"Menu\" button the central area will display icons of the parameters which in conjunction with the left-bar ones represent all the available shooting attributes for the currently selected shooting mode.The most interesting is that if you touch the gearwheel icon on the top, then you can drag with your finger any of 4 icons from the left bar toward the center of the central screen area and drop it there. And then you can touch any other available icon from the central area and the similar way move it to the empty slot on the left bar. By doing this you can customize that quick-access menu separately for each shooting mode the way you need (make sure you touch firmly and drag slowly). And the same way you can choose those quick-access icons for the playback mode as well.ADVANCED FEATURES: TX7 has a number of advanced modes which could be helpful in the difficult light conditions.THH: \"Twilight Hand-Held\" mode can help either to improve a low-light picture quality when the using of flash is prohibited, or to get a picture in so challenging light conditions where otherwise you could not get one at all. In that mode the camera automatically sets the lowest possible ISO and shutter speed, takes 6 consecutive shots within about 1 sec and then combines them into one picture with much less noise. It can be very useful for shooting landscapes in the dusk, the indoors interiors, or museum pieces. If you're going to take pictures of people in that mode then it might be better to tell them \"freeze!\" instead of \"cheers!\" :-)AMB: \"Anti Motion Blur\" is another low-light mode which also takes a number of consecutive shots and then composes their superposition. Unlike the THH-mode this one sets high ISO and fast shutter speed to catch the subjects which might be slightly moving like pets or kids. For example, if for the certain indoors conditions in THH mode a camera can set ISO-200 and the shutter speed 1/30, then in AMB it might set ISO-3200 and 1/200. BTW in a number of cases I noticed the pictures in THH mode were a kind of underexposed and oversaturated with some red or blue tint, so I had to apply some exposure compensation when shooting - about +1.0 - +1.3 and also to do some post-work to adjust the white-balance. Actually both modes use a noise reduction mechanism based on the data averaging. The cornerstone of that mechanism is the fact that the useful data is constant - does not change from one consecutive shot to another, while the noise is fluctuating. So that algorithm when doing the pictures superposition amplifies the constant aspects and reduces the random ones.The processing task in THH-mode is relatively simple: the algorithm should recognize the displacement of each consecutive shot caused by unstable hands and then compensate it while doing the pictures superposition. However in AMB-mode in addition to that shaking hands instability the camera should also identify the subjects which are moving by themselves (like kids or pets). For the static areas the AMB-algorithm can apply as the same averaging noise reduction as in THH-mode, but for the moving subjects the AMB-algorithm should try to identify their trajectory and overlay them separately to reduce their noise. If the AMB-algorithm can not dynamically align them then it takes an image of that moving subject from one of the consecutive shots and just presents it without any noise reduction (the worst-case-scenario). That might happen if the subject is moving too much or if its shape is changing, for example - a jumping dog. I did some testing and found - the less subject moves the better AMB-algorithm can perform its job and so the less noise is visible on the final picture.HDR: \"Backlight Correction HDR\" - One more useful mode. It is not only about backlight conditions but it also might be very helpful in any case when your picture consists of the fragments with very different brightness. Camera does the two shots in a quick succession, each of which is optimized for the lightest and the darkest areas and then combines both of them into one shot. That mode is only effective when there is a huge difference in the areas' luminance. The good news is that even in the earlier models (like my old DSC-T100) and even for the regular shots Sony has been doing a pretty good job of extending the dynamic range. I did not know that until about two years ago I purchased an advanced Kodak's P&S; camera and found that on the same subjects where the Kodak's camera completely washed out some most illuminated areas, the Sony's T100 happened to handle them pretty well! The same is true for TX7 as well.PANORAMA: Another interesting feature is the iSweep Panorama mode. You can shoot either a horizontal or vertical panorama, and there are the two modes: standard and wide. A standard horizontal panorama can cover up to 180 degrees (or less), while with the wide one you could shoot almost the entire circle. Just remember: you should take your horizontal panorama within 10 sec. A standard vertical panorama covers about 130 degrees and the wide one - about 180 degrees, and you should complete it within about 8 sec. Be aware that zoom does not work in that mode and the recording is done at the most wide angle (25 mm equivalent focal length). The resulting horizontal panorama is not of a high quality - it has just 1080 pixels of the vertical resolution. If your subject does not fit the frame or if you want the better resolution you can do this trick: 1) switch to the vertical up-to-down panorama, 2) choose the wide one, 3) turn you camera 90 degree counter-clockwise and shoot your panorama from left-to-right within 8 sec. In this case you will have 1920 pixels vertically. One more hint: Before starting panorama point your camera to any object which is at the average distance and half press the shutter button to catch the right focus. Then holding the button half pressed, turn to the most left position, press the button all the way down and start shooting. It is important because if in your starting direction there is any object which is much closer than most of the objects in you panorama then you would catch a wrong focus and most of the panorama would be out-of-focus.LENS: The TX7 model, unlike many other recent Sony P&S; cameras, was lucky enough to get a genuine Carl Zeiss zoom lens. Its mechanics is just great - it performs zooming, auto-focusing, and the optical image stabilization in absolute silence. However if you start zooming while shooting video and then quickly release that tiny zoom lever you will get a kind of \"clatz-z\" short noise on the recording footage. If you try to release that lever very smoothly you will get gentler \"click-h\" replica.The optical image stabilization of the Carl Zeiss lens in conjunction with the digital one provided by Sony works pretty well and allows to shoot pictures at a very low shutter speed around 1/8 - 1/10 sec so you can use lesser ISO and therefore get better picture quality in the low light condition. Auto focus works well in both daylight and low light situations, especially if in your settings the AF Illuminator is ON.Just be aware the auto focus and image stabilization works all the time your camera is on. It might be convenient from one prospective, but on the other hand is sucks the battery much faster. On my Panasonic ZR1 and ZS3 I can choose a mode when the auto focus is activated only when the shutter button is half pressed and the image stabilization is turned on when you're actually making a shot. It would be nice if Sony provided the similar functionality which would greatly prolong the battery life. Meanwhile open the lens cover only when you're really going to make a shot and close it right after that.ZOOM: The lens has a very convenient for the party (and any indoors) shooting zoom range starting with just 25 mm (of the 35-mm equivalent). It allows to make good framing in pretty small compartments. The quality of the pictures taken at 25 mm are pretty good, however if you apply the full zoom - up to 100 mm (35-mm equivalent) you might experience some quality decrease. Generally when you zoom-in you expect to see the bigger size of the shooting object and to get more visible details. Most of the times when I took a picture of a certain subject first at wide 25 mm focal length and then stretched to the full 100 mm it did not show much more details. The image was bigger, as expected, but more fuzzy with less contrast and saturation. When I was physically walking 4 times closer to the subject and making a shot with the initial 25 mm (equivalent) - the picture was sharp with good contrast and saturation. So if you want to get nice sharp shots - take pictures without much zooming.From my prospective the biggest Sony's achievement and at the same time a source of the picture quality problems in TX7 is the noise reduction mechanism implemented by Sony in this camera.SENSOR: Actually the root cause is the \"Exmor R\" sensor: regardless of all that hype around its low-light performance my own experience with the two Sony cameras - WX1 before and TX7 now shows that sensor is actually at least as the same or even more noisy than its CCD predecessors. May be in theory it should have some advantage, but in the real implementation they either could not make it working properly or may be some other unpredictable problems of that design came to the scene and not only eliminated the anticipated positive effect but also spoiled the entire performance.On many pictures taken with my old Sony DSC-T100 at its lowest ISO-100 I could not admit any noticeable noise. On some pictures taken by TX7 at its lowest ISO-125 some areas, which I guess the processing algorithm did not recognize, show pretty much noise. But that is a relatively rare case because most of the pictures are entirely processed by the Sony's noise reduction mechanism. IMHO the problem is - they're over-processed and even those which were taken at the low ISO.NOISE REDUCTION: That algorithm generally works very well for the evenly-painted surfaces. One of my indoor pictures (without flash) displays a man surrounded with the light-painted walls and also a part of the glossy-black door is visible as well. The picture was taken at the relatively high ISO-320, but that black door shines without a single pixel of noise and the bright walls look very good also. The man's clothes look also clean without any noise and the only problem is his face - it looks like having a thick layer of make-up on it. The picture was taken from the distance just about 3 feet but you can not see the man's eyelashes, and even his eyebrows have become partly obliterated by the aggressive noise reduction.It seems that noise reduction algorithm recognizes the 3 types of picture areas: relatively even panes, sharp edges or transitions, and the parts with a complex structure which can not be divided into the first two categories. It strongly removes the noise from those flat panes pretending they do not have any significant details which are worth to keep, it probably makes some sharpening to the edges, and I guess does nothing to the complex structures because it does not know what would be better to do with them. That assumption comes from the observation of some portrait-like photos taken in iAuto mode with the flash, where a mid-aged person has a plastic-even face with a few scars. The thing is that algorithm put heavy make-up everywhere on the man's face and therefore hid the sensor noise altogether with the most man's wrinkles, but it \"recognized\" a couple of most visible wrinkles as \"edges\" and therefore not only showed them but even made more sharp and contrast what made them looking like scars. The pictures taken with Panasonic ZS3 looked much more natural and showed the real skin texture as well as all the small and big wrinkles the way they were.It seems that noise reduction algorithm is mostly effective for the indoors and in particular for party shooting because most of the interior objects are of either big or medium size with relatively even panes and sharp edges. And the most interesting on such shots is catching of what people were doing instead of their portraits.Sometimes I go to the park and take some shots there. On the pictures taken in the late autumn with my old Sony T100 I can recognize every branch on the numerous trees across a small pond. Of course they're not sharp, but at least I can see the distinct trees with distinct branches. On the similar pictures taken by TX7 many areas with those distant trees look like the picture was rubbed out and the average color was spread across those areas, however some odd tree branches can strike out of those indistinct areas. It seems that happens only on the low-contrast areas, however if there is a bright sky behind the numerous branches of trees in your shot then the picture looks sharp and clear. And by the way, if you are taking pictures of somebody against such a background then your attention will be mostly attracted to that person(s) and you will hardly admit some minor imperfections in the back.MOVIE MODE: The most interesting and I believe the best feature in this tiny package is the full-frame High Definition 1080 60i AVCHD movie mode. Shortly - it's really good! Actually there are the 3 available movie modes: 1080 AVCHD, 720 MP4, and VGA 640x480 MP4.In all the P&S; cameras I have now and had before the VGA mode was nothing to write home about. In WX1 it was a complete trash and even in Olympus E-P2 it was not much better. In the EP2's review I wrote its HD video clips in low-light look like a Wide-VGA, not HD. But with TX7 it's quite opposite: I've never seen so good VGA mode before! It actually looks more like a low-level 4:3 HD than a regular VGA. It's pretty clear and sharp, not much noise even in low-light environment. I guess it better fits for indoor shooting because it seems the noise reduction mechanism wipes out the small details. And one more thing - it's got a mono-sound.The intermediate 720 MP4 mode seems good in case if you are not able to view the AVCHD files. Its quality is slightly lower than the 1080's one so I wouldn't recommend it if your computer allows handling the full HD clips.And the full 1080 60i (interlaced) mode with AVCHD codec is just great. Note: sometimes you can see \"60i\" and the other times - \"50i\". The latter one is for PAL standard in Europe, while the \"60i\" one is for NTSC in the US. The quality is very good: really high resolution, sharp and clear. Both the auto focus and image stabilization work pretty well and no audible sound give them away. The Carl Zeiss lens zoom works absolutely silently so no disturbing sounds being recorded onto the footage.SOUND: What I like very much about TX7 as a high-quality camcorder - it has stereo microphones which point to the subject in front of the camera, which means they mostly catch the person's voice instead of collecting the noise from surroundings. On many other P&S; cameras the microphones are pointed to the ceiling. The microphones have a wide frequency range, which is good enough even for the music recording. They have a pretty good sensitivity and a remarkably low noise.ADVISE: If you're shooting a movie clip of a person in front of the camera, make sure there is no any visible subject behind that person which is brighter or has much more contrast. In the movie mode you can not set the focus to the center or any other point you choose - the camera selects the focusing area on its own, and if there is something more bright or contrast behind the person you're taking picture of, then camera might focus on that subject behind and the person might be out of focus.UPDATE: A series of photos taken indoors at low light with flash on the other day showed very different result than described above. Instead of \"thick layer of make-up\" it was quite opposite - all the small details on the face of a woman (in her mid-forties) as well as her eyes looked very sharp and contrast. I had to reduce both sharpness and contrast in Photoshop to make it more natural, but finally it looked much better than the above mentioned one with the man's face under a heavy \"make-up\". The major difference was ISO: in the first case the camera in \"iAuto\" mode set automatically ISO=320 (on some other similar photos even 400) while this time I set manually in \"P\"rogram mode the minimum ISO=125 and used flash. The pictures were slightly darker, but the skin texture was not missed and the overall result after some post-processing looked much better. So the rule number one of having nice pictures with TX7 is to keep ISO at its minimum whenever it's possible.In my Panasonic cameras (ZS3 & ZR1) the light sensitivity in both HD and VGA-video mode is about the same, but it turned out in TX7 in the VGA mode it's approximately twice higher than in HD and roughly 3 times more than the video-sensitivity of the Panasonic cameras. It's definitely a big plus for the low-light shooting. If you're shooting a full-HD video (1080) in AVCHD mode and it gets underexposed and noisy because of lack of light then try to switch to VGA mode - you might loose some details but the clip might look remarkably better because of much less visible noise.I also did some testing for how long time you can shoot high-quality HD video with the fully charged battery. The TX7's battery indicator has 4 segments. When the battery is full all four segments are turned on. I was recording a sequence of 5-min video clips with 1 min breaks in between them and noticed when the battery segments turned off: - 1st segments turned off after about 12 min of recording - 2nd - after about 22 min - 3rd - after about 32 min - 4th - after about 41 min and the battery indicator became crossed and started blinking.After that I could record for about 1.5 min more until the camera closed the file and the entire display became black with a big crossed blinking battery icon in the middle. So it seems with a fully charged battery you can record your clips for about 40 minutes. It's not that bad since my former Sony HDR-SR7 camcorder provided about 80-90 min of HD recording. The size of each 5-min clip is about 630MB what comes to 2.1MB per second and taking into account that 1 byte has 8 bits that will be close to 17 MBit/sec as stated in the manual for this mode.So this Sony DSC-TX7 camera seems mostly suitable for shooting the indoor still pictures and is very good as a HD video camcorder.", "Date": "February 6, 2010"}, {"Title": "Sony hits Grand Slam with DSC-TX7",

"ReviewID": "R3OY5YKSXWB42V", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Let me start this review with saying that I have owned quite a few digital cameras in the past. Sony (W50, W250), Canon (SD750, SD760IS) and Nikon (S5 or something) are amongst the brands I have tried. All of them were compact point-shoot cameras.My ideal digital camera is one where the following conditions are met:1. I don't have to think of the environment I am in (day or night)2. It MUST be compact so I can carry it around easily, fit it in my pocket, etc.3. It should just work without changing settings all the time.This is exactly that!Good Points:-> Best low-light pictures (finally!!!)-> Amazing Panaromic mode. It is sooo easy to use.-> So many modes, but auto is the best mode.-> Tap to focus certain areas of the screen! Very cool.-> The most compact camera I have seen that has a solid build to it. Nothing cheap about it (including the price!)-> Ability to zoom while recording HD movies! A huge plus.-> 29 minutes of continuous video recording. (most cameras only allow 10)-> The touch screen has an 'easy mode' (aka idiot mode), which hides away all the advanced features and makes it very easy to use-> My SDHC card works (min 8gb recommended)-> Made in Japan (no offense, but to me this says alot about the build quality)Minor Points:-> Battery is not the best, but is not horrible either. Would recommend trying it out first. For most people, it should not be a problem, However, it is so tiny that you can easily carry a couple of them with you. Wait for the prices to come down on the battery and snag a couple of them.-> The silver is actually dark silver. You could even say its dark grey. Looks much better in reality than in pictures. Having said that, I think the Red would be sexy as well!Verdict: Definite Buy!", "Date": "March 1, 2010"}, {"Title": "Sony has a winner", "Author": "W. Otto \"Laser Brain\"", "ReviewID": "R2UKRMZ9LNTK2N", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "The DSC-TX7 was introduced this week (Jan 2010). Overall I am very pleased with it. I can finally take indoor pictures with an acceptable success rate, which has not been possible with older point and shoot cameras except in flash mode. In bright light conditions, or with flash, the camera performs comparably to other point and shoot cameras. Overall, pictures are sharp.ProsExcellent low light performanceVery good video performanceNearly 1 megapixel LCD with touch screenExcellent lens which does not protrude from camera bodyExcellent in-camera panorama functionCan use either SDHC memory or Memory Stick to 32GBVery slim and lightweight designLight to aide focusing in low lightConsRelatively short battery life and slow chargerLack of audio notes recording and audio record volume controlLack of histogram function on picturesSliding cover can be difficult to operate under some conditionsIt is a very slim camera but the performance beats all the other similarly sized cameras I have tried.The Cybershot Handbook manual is very cryptic about several things, but the camera performs well. Although the manual is very unclear about this, you can save money on media by getting the SDHC class 4 memory rather than the Sony proprietary memory stick. The camera will use either type. The maximum memory card capacity is 32 GB, enough even for HD movies.At first the CMOS sensor seems to give very good performance compared to the CCD competition, and the camera excels in low light conditions. Upon closer examination, you will find that Sony has put that fast processor to work doing aggressive noise reduction. In addition to this, the camera has a twilight handheld mode which snaps 6 different frames, and picks the best parts of each frame to synthesize a single final frame. So long as things do not move rapidly, and your lighting conditions do not vary (such as with fluorescent or sodium lights which tend to stobe) things work well. Combined with optical stabilization and the CMOS sensor, this makes possible shots that would be hopelessly blurred in the other cameras I have tried.Another advertised trick is the backlight correction HDR or high dynamic range function. In this mode, the camera takes two exposures, with different exposure times, and combines the bright parts of the picture from one frame and the dim parts of the picture from the other frame. This is supposed to allow details in the shadow and details in the highlights to both be visible. In practice, this extends the dynamic range only slightly over that of other cameras. Flash can not be used, and pictures inside a darkened room with a sunlit view through the window are only partly compensated. I found the results to be less exciting than advertised. I think Sony needs to work on this particular mode.The touch screen interface only takes a few minutes to get used to, and using the camera is a joy.  In general the pictures are very good, but do not compete with the pictures from a full size DSLR.TransferJet only works if you use TransferJet enabled Memory sticks.The panorama function is guided by the camera; all you have to do is tilt the camera from side to side. It takes the frames and stitches them automatically. I tried it inside my home office. It managed to stitch together a nice panorama when I thought it would be seriously messed up. Instead it worked fine, even in relatively low light.Here are the test photos: [...]. You will notice that the tiny Sony compares very favorably to the much larger Fujifilm S7000. Please see the comments below for additional information.WHAT I WOULD LIKE TO SEE IMPROVEDAll the things I listed under cons plus:I would like the manual to be better written and contain detail such as, what are all those options in the P mode that are available? It seems Sony wants you to play with the camera until you find what you want.There is not much control over the exposure except to take a shot, and if you don't like it you can adjust the exposure up or down. This is an awkward and time consuming process. You have to trust the camera to get it right, and there is no histogram to guide you in any event.The zoom function relies on a tiny switch that seems out of place given that almost all other functions are available on the touch screen.The automatic white balance function produced slightly-yellowish pictures under some incandescent lighting conditions.That nifty sliding panel on the front is attractive and a neat idea, but it can be a little difficult under some conditions to slide open or shut. If there were some grooves to give you a better grip it would help. Surely someone could have designed some attractive grooves.I am not sure what the point of the little docking station is. A simple USB connector would have been just as effective and saved us all $20. Or the money could have been used to supply a much needed carrying case.", "Date": "January 29, 2010"}, {"Title": "Good performance for small size", "Author": "Gadget Joe", "ReviewID": "R2MFAESI3QSYRX", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Sony recently introduced this camera at CES and it is an upgrade on the TX1 model from last year.I ordered the silver one - it is much darker than the pictures show, so expect it to be a gun metal gray color. Size wise its about an inch shorter than an iPhone, about the same width. Fits nicely in one's pocket. The touch screen is slightly larger than an iPhone's screen. Quality of the build is about the same as a low end Cannon, but not as good as you would expect in a Cannon G10 or G11 (which I love). The finish on the plug-in battery charger is poor - you can tell it is \"Made in China\" than \"Made in Japan\".  The camera itself is made in Japan and the finsih is good, maybe a little flimsy (e.g. battery compartment door)- I wonder what it would look like after a few years of handling especially on vacations. Some of this may be due to its diminutive size.Overall it takes good pictures and I was attracted by a few features which are not typically available on other camers: (1) Hand held twilight mode which makes for great low light pictures (2)AVCHD Video mode (which plays quite well with Windows Media Player) and (3) Panorama mode which stiches pictures together.Most people don't realize that this camera uses the widely available (and inexpensive) SD cards rather than Sony's proprietary cards.  The screen is beautiful, but the menu system takes some getting used to, especially if you have been using Nikon or Cannon cameras.A few of the issues with this camera:(1) The slider which comes down to take pictures is slippery and lacks grip - Sony should have created a ridge to assist in the sliding motion(2) It's very easy to get your finger in the picture - so if you are accustomed to holding your camera with both hands, watch out for your finger in pictures (lens placement is not optimal)(3) The manual which comes with the camera is useless - you have to download the manual from the accompanying CD - even that is not the best - wish they could have made it more user friendly(4) Battery life could be improvedOverall, I would recommend this camera - the price is about fifty dollars higher than its value, but it does have quite a few bells and whistles.", "Date": "January 29, 2010"}, {"Title": "Awesome camera, but fully automated!", "Author": "Naomi Angelio", "ReviewID": "R1N5N8U2H3DV47", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Two weeks ago, I bought this camera to replace a T700. Photography is my hobby, though I consider myself an amateur with a keen eye. I have mastered the features of every point-and-shoot I have ever owned.The Good:- Beautiful exterior design. This camera's color is a deep, metallic red.- This 2010 model takes SDHC cards.- Panoramic feature makes landscape photos easy to create. Just pan the camera to the right.- HD video is beautiful!- Touchscreen layout is intuitive. One can use their hand (or the provided stylus) to slide across the screen to access additional menus (like an iPhone). One may also manually select the point of focus.- Indoor and low-light pictures come out very well. Handheld twilight allows those with shaky hands to take nice photos (camera takes six pictures and combines them for the least noise/graininess).- Multiburst in three different speeds.- Left menu can be customized with the most-used features.- Packed with features and editing tools, though I have not used the other settings yet.- Camera package includes a dock and cables to connect to computers and televisions.- Similar slideshow functions as T700 for a delightful photo-viewing experience.The Bad:- Wide-angle lens distorts the shape of people when not zoomed in. People's heads are shaped strangely, especially if they move within the picture.- Low battery life. Battery is also extremely pricey.- Compared to the T700, the flash is very limited. When taking a non-zoomed photo, there is a strange distribution of flash - four sides of the photo are dim, while the middle is bright. Sometimes, the flash overexposes the photo, such that the subjects appear ghostlike.- Fully automated; there is a 'program' function, but everything on it is preset.- Just an annoyance: I couldn't find a setting to turn off auto-review. I usually take many photos in succession (not burst mode), so I don't use time to review what I've taken. Using burst mode is not a viable solution because an increase in shutter speed means less light is let into the lens.Personally, I don't prefer a camera controlled by touch screen, as this probably uses more battery power than pushing buttons; however, the interface is well-designed. In general, this camera is slim and easy to use; I would recommend it to anyone who likes to take pictures and enjoys a large screen for viewing photos.", "Date": "April 8, 2010"}, {"Title": "Best SONY Camera I've owned.. but...", "Author": "B. Kim", "ReviewID": "RDSEBPI7OGQ7G", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I've owned Nikon, Casio, Canon, and Sony.  I've always been a big fan of SONY's ultra portables NOT because of their picture quality but their NON-popping lens design.  The lens that come out tend to get stuck on me for no reason and most of the time they are not covered by warranty (what??).This is by far the best SONY camera I've owned.  It is not as thin as some T series or waterproof like the TX5 but definitely worth noting for several reasons.  For those that wondered the difference between TX5 and TX7... this review is for you.Let me start by some of my first time impressions.  I was afraid of this touch screen design cause I hear touchscreens on cameras are a nightmare and I have some awful stories myself.  But this was a pleasant surprised and I loved it.  It is simple and most importantly HIGH performance.  This is important since a photosnap happens at a moment's notice.  Customizing the screen is also very useful for me.  The 10 FPS shooting is way beyond impressive.. iSweep OMG.. by far the best panorama stitching feature ever!  The anti motion blur is not as sharp but FAR more useful shots than if you had a motion blur!  Dark shots are great considering it is a point and shoot.. especially with anti motion blur and twilight feature.  BLACKLIGHT HDR does not work well for me... at least not yet.  I haven't seen any difference on that yet.  The HD video is nothing short of amazing from a camera this size!  It destroys some camcorders!  No really, 1080i AVCHD must be seen to be believed.  This camera has a wide angle lens which makes taking pictures awesome!Why did I pick this over TX5?  TX5 is like the TX1 refit into a tougher shell.  TX7 has the 1080i video which is downgradeable to TX5's 720p.  TX7 also has a much wider angle lens.  The SD Card slot on the TX7 is also very useful.  I'm using an SD card.So.. why the four stars you ask?While the wide angle lens is awesome... it has its drawbacks.  Not only are the colors and picture quality in general does not match Canon... it creates distortions on close ups and some random pictures.  It has a slight Fish eye effect toward the edges.  Taking a vertical shot of someone also distorts them from a weird perspective.  Again, the distortion can be closely described as a fisheye effect.  Macro shots has the heaviest fish eye effect.  This makes the photo's a little annoying at times especially if you are like me and you notice.  An average person wouldn't notice it though.  Picture quality is good enough but it seems like SONY has a harsher sharpness than that of Canon or Nikon.  Again, an average person wouldn't notice it.I also found it somewhat annoying on the MAC.  I have not used it with a PC so I don't know that side.  But as for the MAC,  everything works fine.  But you can't download the movies into iphoto, only imovie.  So you have to use two different programs to download the contents of the camera... and imovie will not automatically delete after import nor does it have that option.  The SONY camera adds like 3 different Flash Drive like discs onto the mac and all three must be ejected to unplug the camera which is annoying.  Ejecting from iphoto will not eject the other two drives.  All in all, it's an annoyance but at least it is working on the MAC without additional software or drivers.I think the biggest shortcoming of the camera is the fisheye effect on some pictures and less than stellar quality pix, but other features of the camera well makes up for that.  For example the iSweep and the 10FPS feature already got me pix I would never have gotten on other cameras.  I love this camera so much.  I totally abuse my cameras so let's see how long this one lasts!  I'm expecting long.  The longest a camera ever lasted on me was SONY U series and it was about 2 years.  Shortest was a Canon Powershot at 2 months (lens stuck).", "Date": "May 31, 2010"}, {"Title": "Iphone of Cameras", "Author": "Sky Blue", "ReviewID": "R3VM09IXR5HY72", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I am an amateur photographer and have used many fine cameras including Leica M7, Konica Hexar, Contax G2, Canon EOS 3, EOS 5D, among others.  They were all incredible cameras but over the time there is one thing I realized: the best camera is the one that could capture the moment.  In other words, you must have it when the moment comes and it must function to catch the millisecond.  All the aforementioned fantastic cameras failed to meet the challenge.  They were either too big for me to have it on the scene or too complicated to capture the moment (uhhh... I was focusing...).  On the opposite side of the pole, most compact cameras had problems of their own: (i) slow operation (you have to turn it on and after 2 seconds it starts to work -- more like an electronic appliance than a camera) and (ii) (if any bit faster and simpler than that) unacceptable picture quality. Clearly, there was a sore need for a solution.  But most cameras were a compromise between the two poles rather than a clear solution.Enter TX7.  This one works wonder.  Incredible size: it is even smaller than the previous cybershot I had -- W170.  It is a tad bit thicker than an Iphone, but far shorter in legnth and you can carry the two easily together in a pocket.  Its controls work like Iphone as well: you can shift pictures with your fingers when viewing.  Its response time is almost the same as heavy DSLRs, which used to be a much more important reason than photo quality to dismiss a compact camera over a DSLR.  What I disliked most in many compact cameras was the lens coming out when you turn the camera on, and this small camera is utterly devoid of the vice.Now about the photo and video quality.  Two things to comment on: fantastic low-light performance and absolutely terrific video performance.  Intelligent mode takes care of most photo needs intelligently, including automatic exposure correction for facing sunlight.  If the situation calls for a shake-proof photo, there is a special setting for such (the processing time will be a bit longer, but not a problem if you don't shoot multiple in sequence.)  These two features get rid of number one reason amateur photos fail -- no exposure compensation and shaken photos.  In addition, the quality of low-light photos (ie high ISO) is significantly better than most compact cameras, including Sony's own W170.As for the video, leave your camcorder home.  I went to Boracay with both this one and my trusted SONY HDR-CX12 camcorder, and guess what?  To my disbelief, I found out when I returned home there was not a single motion captured with my camcorder.  Both my photo needs and camcorder needs have been completely taken care of by this little TX7.  (This is exact opposite of what happened when I went to Europe last fall: I noticed my CX12 camcorder did all the work including photo taking whereas as my EOS 5D stayed in my trunk back in hotel room.  Size and weight are crucial considerations for trips.  The only other camera I would consider carrying from time to time in the future would be a film camera such as Leica M7, since they offer something a digital experience cannot.  I see a very little reason to carry a DSLR and a camcorder -- now they have been relegated to strictly home shooting.)  At home, when I blew up my videos taken with TX7 on my 120 inch projection screen, I could not really find any quality problem.  When something that small and light does a task just as well, why carry the big one?All in all, Sony has a winner with this one.  I will not hesitate to recommend this one and if I were in Japan I would even consider buying Sony shares.  A company making this kind of product can't go wrong.", "Date": "May 22, 2010"}, {"Title": "Great modern pocket camera", "Author": "R Shackleford", "ReviewID": "R267BGAFR1QII2", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Many times with electronics there are features that sound great but don't really live up to expectations. The TX7 has a very interesting feature list and the great thing is none are a let down, IMO. Everything just works. The low light ability of this camera is a real stand out. If you're like me and dislike photos taken with a flash you'll love handheld twilight. In this mode the camera takes 6 photos with different settings in less than a second and combines them into one that results in a low light picture that looks exactly like what you see with your eyes. Most of the time you'll probably have the camera in iAuto mode and it works excellent. The nice thing is it instantly shows the setting it's picked for you on the screen just by pointing the camera so you know it's working, and on that same point can manually change the settings if you want something different. Turn on iSCN+ while in iAUTO and it'll take 2 pics (instantly, with one press) with different settings and saves them both, so you almost always end up with a shot you like in auto mode. The panorama mode is very cool and fool proof. Then of course there is the HD video! 1920x1080 60i HD video with stereo audio. Video quality is excellent and wrapped up with everything else this camera offers makes it a great choice.

Canon currently has no feature match for the TX7 in a P&S; style camera this small.I think other reviews have done a great job of running down the pros and cons, but I have to say that, besides the slew of interesting features in such a small package, the thing that got me interested was that this is the first Sony camera that takes regular SDHC cards (it also can use the proprietary Sony Memory Sticks).Summary:  Pros:  - Great camera features in a small package!  - May be the best low-light performer for its size  - AVCHD *and* MP4 video formats (your choice)  - SDHC *and* Sony Memory stick compatible (your choice)  Cons:  - Short-ish battery life and longer-than-average recharge time  - Poor lens cover design  - No audio leveling of any kind (not even a distortion light)  - Only one physical connection port and it's proprietaryAs others have mentioned, the slide-down lens cover is the biggest ergonomic gaffe, though it's probably not going to be a dealbreaker for most folks (just adding a couple of little metal ridges to the cover would have significantly improved it). It's easy to run your thumb over the lens when pushing the cover down. People with large hands may also find the tiny buttons and skinniness of the camera a bit daunting.The \"blue\" camera, by the way, is actually \"dark blue\" and is so dark that it looks like it's black - my friend and I could barely see any blue in it. (Is there also a \"blue\" as well as a \"dark blue\"? The photo on Amazon looks like a considerably lighter shade of blue than my camera).The video capability has been heavily touted, but I haven't read much about the accompanying audio. Unfortunately, the camera provides no way to control the volume levels at all. You get whatever comes in the stereo mic on the front of the camera (Sure, it's just a tiny P&S;, but if you're going to put high quality video formats into the camera, why not basic audio level control too?). There's not even a distortion light.I tried recording a very loud band, and, of course, it did distort, but, overall, it definitely handled audio better than my Canon TX-1.By the way Mac users, MP4 videos files show up in iphoto9, but AVCHD files do not. However, the SDHC card mounts as a disk on your desktop, so you can simply drag the AVCHD files to your hard drive when USB connected. There is also Sony's PMB software, but I didn't feel like installing it. There is the option of using TransferJet, but I don't feel like paying for the expensive TransferJet card and I don't have any TransferJet-compliant devices anyway.Speaking of USB, one thing that bugged me is that the only I/O port on the camera is a proprietary Sony port. Sony supplies a little dock with the camera and your standard cables (HDMI, USB, etc) plug into the dock. Some may like that, but I prefer just plugging a USB cable directly into the camera. Fortunately, you can buy a USB cable that has USB on one end and the Sony proprietary connector on the other (I've seen a 6ft long one for $15 or so, but is there a short one?). The dock has a DC-in port but you have to buy an AC adapter for that. The manual says that the AC adapter does not charge the battery (I assume it just maintains the battery level at its current level).The slide-down lens cover is a bad enough design (in an all too-important place) to give 1/2 or 1/3 of a star off. The lack of audio control is also problematical (at these prices, anyway). Battery life isn't that great, especially when shooting video. The proprietary connector port is a nuisance. I'm going to have to give this 4 stars though it does have a very nice feature set in a very small package.", "Date": "February 8, 2010"}, {"Title": "Amazing photos, great video, fun to use", "Author": "Mark K. Eyer", "ReviewID": "R2B9PAAVWGSEJ8", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I am just back from two weeks in southern France with my new DSC-TX7. I love this camera. I took about a thousand photos and about an hour of video, and it all fit comfortably within the amount of available memory in the camera. I especially like the convenience of this unit. I carried it in the pocket of my jeans the whole trip. I could pop it out, turn it on, and take a shot on very short notice. The low light capability is amazing; I shot some photos inside a cave and the camera brought out colors and details my naked eye could not see. The panorama mode is fun and easy and produces great high-res images. I brought along a new HD video camcorder and wound up not using it after I discovered the video mode in the TSC-TX7 produces beautiful HD-resolution full frame-rate video.Operating the camera is fun and easy and does not require reading the manual (for me anyway). The 3-1/2\" touch-screen display is big and crisp and does everything you'd expect. It lets you easily adjust settings and modes, browse through your images, etc. When I returned from travel, I connected the camera to my HD TV display via an HDMI cable, set the camera to \"slide show\" mode, and voila, it created a great presentation, interspersing the video clips and the stills in the order they were shot. The display style and background music is selectable, and you can even upload your own audio tracks if you want.  The lens and zoom system (4x optical) is a great balance and very practical. I was trying to read the fine print on a map and realized that I could use the camera as a magnifying glass. At 1.0 zoom it goes to a \"close focus\" mode and lets you get within a quarter of an inch of the subject. The flash is plenty bright and can be easily turned off. There are three burst modes (low, mid, high) that work great.The only downsides I can note are that the battery life is somewhat short (I carried a second battery with me, and would switch it out typically at the end of a long day of shooting).  The 4x zoom is usually sufficient to frame faraway subjects, but because the camera is so small, it can be hard to hold it steady.

The video capabilities on that camera are now dated, however, and I was looking for a camera that could at least meet the image quality of my now 5-year-old camera while upping the ante on the video quality.  Seeing the 1080/60i AVCHD video recording capability and after reading so many good reviews about it, I thought the DSC-TX7 was finally the camera I had been looking for.  I should have kept looking...Starting with the good:For those who haven't seen them side-by-side, 60-Hertz video (found in virtually all camcorders), looks significantly better than the 30 frames-per-second video found in the majority of the best photo cameras.  This camera is one of only three digital photo cameras on the market today to offer 60-Hertz 1080i video, and the quality is very good.  The lens on this camera isn't quite up to creating a perfectly sharp image even at 2 megapixels (1080i), but the video quality is still far better than any other camera that is even close to the size of this camera.  If you're looking at a Flip Video camera or something similar, get this instead.  I've looked at a lot of video cameras, and this camera has the best video quality of any pocketable video or photo camera.The Panorama mode is quite fun, and results in some interesting shots, but this is not a feature I was looking for when I purchased the camera.Now the bad:As mentioned above, the lens in this camera is terrible.  It doesn't let enough light in for the 10 Megapixel sensor to get a decent image.  The camera designers have compensated for this by doing extensive noise reduction, even on low-ISO images, and all fine detail of the images is lost, even in direct sunlight.  Additionally, the lens causes everything to have a glowy haze around it as if something was smeared on the lens, but my lens was clean.  Image samples found on-line at camera review sites also exhibit this halo affect, so it isn't just my camera.The automatic white balance also does not work properly at all except in direct sunlight.  You must hit 5 buttons to manually set the white balance every time you turn the camera on or photos come out with a strong yellow cast.  Even in bright sunlight, though, photos lack warmth and somehow manage to look both over-saturated and gloomy at the same time.The Hand-Held Twilight feature definitely makes up for the poor lens a bit, when used, but unfortunately you can't use that feature when photographing moving subjects.There are no manual controls on this camera to adjust the shutter speed, or aperture, much less color adjustments to correct the over-saturation or to tune down the noise reduction.", "Date": "June 4, 2010"}, {"Title": "Excellent portable point and shoot", "Author": "Patrick Turpen", "ReviewID": "RVWS2P7DGAZOD", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "If you're looking for a point and shoot camera that produces better than average snap shots then this is the camera for you.

Easy slide up and down function for on/off use is great. I actually down graded from 12.1MP to this one. The TX5 is it's little brother and can be submersed in water but lacks the HDR option the TX7 has. This is true HDR to my knowledge and not to be confused with the over saturated HDR creations. It would have been nice though if they could have merged 3 shots instead of just 2. The iSweep (panoramic) function is excellent and I've been using that option quite a bit.The bad is the battery doesn't last too long and as always extra batteries cost a lot. However, it's worth getting at least one if not two extra batteries because the picture quality is worth it.

The Sony HG5 had ridiculous placement of mic, flash etc. The Canon 210 took great stills but abysmal HD video; plus the LCD screen wasn't crisp and bright; it was also not user friendly. But, at last, I feel like I've hit the mother lode. I started taking pics and vids the moment I got it out of the box.  I haven't looked at the manual yet.  The touch screen is big, self explanatory and wonderful to use. The auto mode is the best I've come across, going from macro to landscape to twilight etc in the blink of an eye. Pictures are accurate, sharp, have depth and the colors are bright and natural. As far as the video, the 1080 60i looks as good as my Canon 1080P video camera. However, the steady shot could be steadier. The zoom is smooth and never distorts. It's a great feeling to know I don't have to lug two cameras around with me, one for still one for video.

Might take a little tweaking of the settings, but even a novice like me was able to get it with minimum effort.--> Beautiful video quality.--> Big touchscreen with many options at your fingertips.  More use-friendly than having conventional buttons--> Very sleek-looking camera, especially the silver (which is a dark silver or gray color).--> Included Sony software makes it easy to burn HD quality videos to DVD.  You can play them on Blu-Ray players or DVD players, depending on how you burn them to disc (explained in the handbook).Cons:--> Biggest drawback is the battery life.  This sucker uses up energy like there's no tomorrow, especially when compared with my Sony Cyber-shot DSC-P200/S.  Definitely have a spare with you if you're shooting video or using it for an extended period of time.--> The lens is too close to where your left hand would be when holding the camera.  I find myself constantly covering the left part of the view.--> When shooting video with almost no noise around, you can hear the camera zooming in and out, barely.  I had heard that this was a problem on other Sony cameras when shooting video.  But it is not noticeable when there is surrounding noise.There's a handbook for this camera that you can only find on the CD that comes with it or online (no hard copy).  You should definitely read this.

It takes great pics both inside and out.  The HD (1080P) is fantastic and looks great inside and out as well.  Where this camera really shines in indoor with low light.  The built in HDR feature has been the best this about this camera, it allows to take great pics in really low light without a flash, and the pic has little to no noise. This is also one of the newer sony cameras that allow you to use an SD card instead of the MS cards sony sells. So my 16gb SDHC card that I bought for the FX580 works just great.

It does a great job in these situations.The video quality is just incredible.  And I'm not just speaking in comparison to other ultra compact point & shoot cameras.  The video quality is just as good as a very expensive HD camcorder.  It lacks many of the manual video settings, but you can still zoom while recording.

The slide show with built-in music is a great feature when connected to the TV also.I-Sweep Panorama works really well, in all directions (up & down also)Intelligent Auto mode can tell which scene to use.  It goes into macro when it's supposed to, even a tripod mode when it senses no movement, which I would guess slows down the shutter speed.Smile Shutter is awesome for kid pictures.  It works really well, you can set the sensitivity from a grin > medium smile > big cheesy smile!  Then it takes the pictures for you.You can customize shortcut buttons for each mode that you use.  In other words, you put the shortcut icons you want for each mode, on that main screen.  No hunting in a second menu for the most frequently used settings, even in playback mode!

Dear \"Kawika\"", "ReviewID": "R9ZVP7RL3FBXS", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "First, I want to give props to Sony for adding a SD/SDHC media slot, otherwise, I would not even consider this digital camera. I do not want to pay double the price for Sony's Memory Stick Duo versus SD/SDHC cards with same capacity. When shopping for a new camera, I considered all the major brands and Sony's DSC-TX1 and CyberShot T90. Currently, I have a Canon PowerShot SD600 digital camera that has given me many many great pics. However, its about four years old and I want the newest, latest technology. I searched the web for all the digital cameras I was interested in and then went to Best Buys and Fry's Electronic to see and test them. Nothing, I felt, came close to this camera with all its features. The Sony DSC-TX7 is slim, about two-thirds of an inch thick, but there are other thinner digital cameras out there if that is what you are looking for. My Canon dimensions overall is smaller than this camera. Turning on the camera is quick and easy. Slide the cover down and it's ready to take pics/videos in about 2 seconds. The lens does not pop out like many other digital cameras. The lens stay internal even when using the optical zoom, which is why it's only 4X. Not a problem if your subject is not distant. It's wide angle lens allows you to get more picture or closer to your subject. A small issue I encountered is that sometimes while sliding the cover open, my thumb would touch the top of the lens dirtying it. I have an average size hand so it may be a concern for those with large hands. The 3.5\" touchscreen LCD viewfinder was absolutely the best with excellent sharpness, brightness and clarity. I suggest you try it at the store and you will see when you compare it to other cameras. Give credit to the optics of a Carl Zeiss Vario-Tessar lens and xtra fine LCD screen. In full sun, I was clearly able see the the subject in the viewfinder. With my Canon, the screen was totally dark and even with my hand partially blocking the sunlight, it was very difficult to see anything. I have taken hundreds of photos/videos with the TX7 in many different lighting conditions and I am very pleased with the results. The photos/videos are clear and sharp, and the colors are vivid and fairly accurate. In low-light conditions without the flash, the TX7 takes very good pics that was much less grainy than my Canon SD600. For extreme close-ups, it has two settings, macro and super macro. With super macro, I was able to be one-inch away and still have a super sharp focus on the subject I was pointing at. You won't find that with any other brand camera unless its a DSLR camera. The iSweep Panorama Mode is very cool, simple and easy to use. After pressing the panorama mode and then the start icon, just move the camera slowly in one direction and it will capture a panorama picture. That's it and the camera does the rest. No need for photo editing software to stitch your photos together. The battery life has so far been good. I have used the camera all day long, taking mostly photos and some videos, and have not had a dead battery. Sorry, but I did not count the number of photos taken or the length of the videos. An extra Sony battery will run about $50, quite expensive, so I am waiting for the generic ones to come out on eBay, which will cost considerably less. The TX7 has only 45 MB of internal memory, which is not much so I bought a 16 GB SDHC, class 6, memory card on Amazon for about $40.00. That will allow me about 5 hours of HD quality video or thousands of high-resolution photos.

Super fast, excellent in low light.  HD movies with image stabilization.A few tips:  1. Careful with the touchscreen.  I do not believe in cases.  Why get something that fits in your pocket and put it somewhere else in a case.  So, don't do cases.  However, I used this one in a nylon backpack and it ate the coating off the screen in patches.  Looks awful now.  No other damage.  To fix, we put it in a sock (that worked perfectly).  Now I am looking to find a way to eat the rest of the coating off - the glass is fine, just the coating is delicate.  Maybe more nylon.  2. Windows 7 can load the photos off the camera directly, so don't use their software.  That worked best for me.  3. I have the SDHC and it works fine.  No issues on that one.  Great solution.  4. For low light indoor picks, turn the flash off.  No compact flash can do well indoors, frankly, and it does very well in low light when you make it try.  5. Movies are awesome, but Movie filming eats the battery while you watch - if you film 2 minutes with an 8 month old battery you can watch it drain.

Very good Macro shots - Takes some very nice close focus shots. Never seen such quality macro pics in any other point and shoot cameras.3.

No need to run or wait for the camera timer.8. Full HD video - Full HD video recording mode with stereo mic.9. HDMI support for direct playback on HDTV.10. SD, SDHC memory card support.Cons -1. Battery life (230 shots) is less compared to other available cameras in the same price range.2. The glossy finish on the camera body and no added grip on it, makes camera vulnerable to damages, as there is always a risk that it may slip from your hands. So I am keeping extra caution by using the wrist strap provided.3. Zoom button is a bit tricky to get use to.4. Multi o/p port is not easier to deal with. Its difficult to pull out HDMI cable once inserted. Also the once which I got from the box, is kind of loose and when I try to pull HDMI cable out, its not that easy. Sony should have given at least a USB connection directly in camera.Recommendations for buyers -1. Also buy the Sony accessory kit ACC-CTBN as well. This kit has an extra battery, which is a must when you are planning a full day visit to a theme park, or going for a camp etc. Also this kit has a camera case from Sony and a very nice 3 inch tripod. Both spare battery and tripod along with camera can easily fit in this camera case.2. Use Cyberlink Power DVD 10 to play the AVCHD video recorded by camera on your PC. Media player is not a good option to play AVCHD.4.

The video was amazing, superb color, great sound, and blu-ray quality. PC playback descent but washed out, which may be something to do with my computer? AVCHD Playback was Awesome. After watching reviews of playback online I was shocked at the quality I actually received. The online video reviews of this camera compared to AVCHD playback was like comparing old analog TV's to 1080p blu-ray. There are some cons...Video cons. Indoor video quality in not that great, the camera needs lots of light. And focus was slow if the camera moved too quickly. The camera is also in desperate need of better image stabilization.Compact. I love the size and ease of carrying this camera around. Although the size sometimes caused issues with the way I held it. My finger was sometimes captured in the top left corner of video or pictures.Screen quality. This camera has awesome playback. The screen is crisp and clear, at 921K pixels it ought to be.What I did not like:Pictures con. The quality of the pictures was somewhat disappointing. In full daylight I had grainy and blurry pictures, but the big issue was barrel distortion. I like to take pictures with my subjects off centered; with this camera you must keep people exactly in the center or you will experience major distortion. Low light or indoor pictures are also disappointing, this was one of the main reasons I bought this camera, for the supposed low light ability, I was very let down. The indoor pictures came out dark and grainy. You definitely need to use a flash. I am glad my son took pictures with my 5 year old Cannon to catalog the 4th of July holiday.Pictures pro. I have heard people complain about the color, but that is the one area this camera succeeded. I think that is because I am colorblind. Most camera pictures look like \"real life\" to me, but this camera looked nothing like \"real life\". There were all sorts of colors I did not noticed while taking the pictures. I could see reds, purples, and greens like never before. That could be because the photos are saturated with color, I don't know, but I liked the color of the photos. Arches national park always looked brown and blah to me, but after uploading the images on my computer I was amazed. The sand and rocks were all shades of beautiful red. And fireworks only look blue, yellow, or white to me, but the pictures and video revealed red, green, orange, and purple ones!Touch screen. The touch screen was fun the first day, but with daily application I grew to hate it. Often I would accidently touch my palm to the screen and a setting would change or it would start recording resulting in a missed picture opportunity. Other times I would touch the button and it would not register, frustrating!Zoom. I thought a 4x zoom would be okay, boy was I wrong. If you do a lot of outdoor activities you will realize the zoom quickly becomes insufficient.Battery. The battery did not live up to its expected life. Each day of our vacation I ran out of power. I took 622 pictures and 32 minutes of video over seven days. I needed to charge the battery daily as it was almost dead by the end of the day.Conclusion. In the end I returned the camera. I was not willing to sacrifice picture quality for compact size. To me this camera should be priced around $150 for its picture quality. I assume most of the price is built into its video capability, fancy touch screen, and size, which to me in not worth the added cost.

The photos on this TX7 are a bit soft but no doubt clear for someone who just wants birthday and/or vacation photos. The zoom is not too far but the panorama feature is absolutely cool. The back light feature really enhances the photos quite nicely.Battery: 1/5 starsIt's not the camera's fault of course; however, the NP-BN1 battery sucks so much juice out of the 1080i videos that you'll be recharging every other hour. Also, the battery takes roughly an hour to charge but more will give a bit of boost. Be sure to use the battery all the way then allow for a full recharge just like any other battery. I'd recommend purchasing another battery and for $32.00 on Amazon.com is really a deal (better than $49.99 at other places).Overall: 4/5 starsThis camera is truly unreal. The TX9, however, will be released in several weeks (middle September) with a 12.1MP feature. So, for an extra $50.00 I would purchase that camera since I personally enjoyed the crispiness and clarity of my W290. This TX7 is just so comfortable, light and portable.

Just people looking to capture memories in 1080i makes this camera worth the $349.99 (better than $599.99 and up for the handycam).

I purchased it specifically for its full HD video recording capability. I found its photo quality to be somewhat inferior compared to Canon cameras. Nevertheless, I am using it almost exclusively for video shooting. So far I am profoundly impressed by the quality of 1080/60i AVCHD video (as seen on 50\" HDTV). It is very well comparable to that of full size entry level HD camcorders. The colors are very realistic (not oversaturated like cheap pocket camcorders), there is no visible pixilation; the microphone is tuned to pick up voice instead of noise. The autofocus works great; you can basically shoot videos in macro mode. Also with optical image stabilization, the videos don't come out looking all \"shaky\" and \"vibrating\" like those from Flip and the like. This camera is super small, slim and light. Isn't it great to be able to take high quality HD videos on the go instead of just photos?! Easily fits in jeans pocket. I give this camera 5 stars because I think there is simply no competition to it at this point  - try to find a high quality AVCHD camcorder with optical image stabilization, optical zoom, stereo Dolby plus microphone, etc of this size.The camera comes with a dock which has full-size HDMI out port for easy connection to HDTV as well as USB, A/V and DC ports. Unfortunately the DC adapter is not included. Even though it cannot be used to charge the camera, it will however power it so you won't be draining the battery during playback which can be essential because the battery runs out really quick when filming or playing HD.My advice - do not buy this camera for photo taking because you will be majorly disappointed by the photo quality (many of the pictures I took came out quite grainy). That of course if you're used to Canon... But if you aim to use it primarily for video shooting - there is not much to think about.", "Date": "May 21, 2010"}, {"Title": "Great Camera", "Author": "LB", "ReviewID": "RX322KK83RE53", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I've owned several lines of the Sony pocket cams, and this is by far their best yet.

Sony clearly is cheaping out on the housing, perhaps they wanted it to be more lightweight but the T100 was finished in a kind of brushed aluminum.. the TX7 is plastic. The sliding front cover was firm yet smooth on the T100, on the TX7 it required considerable force... at least 4-5 times more, first couple times I had to use both hands or get my nails to engage the edge and then yank it down. Sony definitely failed on this front.. thankfully, that's the only thing thats worse.Features: The quality of photos with flash is pretty bad in certain scenarios but non-flash pics are a huge improvement. The menu design is a HUGE improvement. I hated having to go through menus to go between movie and photo mode, it took many valuable seconds... now once you've made your movie settings, no never need to go back to the movie mode.. you can take photos or video from the same setting. The movies in lower light do have a fair amount of weird chromatic artifacts, but the low light ability is way better than the T100. This is the primary reason I am replacing my T100, fed up with videos looking too dark... also the battery life seems to be improved.. the T100 was ridiculously poor. This is way better now but still gets drained quickly.", "Date": "April 4, 2010"}, {"Title": "Tale of Two TX7s", "Author": "John R.

Flare creates milky areas or streaks in the image, and is caused by stray light bouncing around inside the lens.

So I bought a second TX7 and ran side-by-side comparisons.  The first continued to show flaring, the second did not.  So when you read a review that says \"This camera takes awful pictures!\" there may be nothing wrong with the camera design--the person probably just got a bad one, like I did.

See my separate review on that camera.Anyway, I've been doing photography for four decades, and during that time the technological strides have been profound.  In 1970, when I got my first SLR, a camera like the TX7 would have been pure science fiction--in fact, it would have seemed more science fiction-y than colonies on Mars.  But despite these advances there are still two major challenges in photography: dynamic range and low-light performance.  That's why I was interested in the two Sonys, since they attempt to address these problems.The HDR Mode on the TX7 tries to increase the dynamic range of an image by taking two shots in succession, one slightly underexposed and the other slightly overexposed, and then integrates the two to get the best of both worlds.  A good idea, but the results are merely OK.  Sony doesn't say, but my tests show that the range is just -1EV/+1EV.  That's not enough.  If you've done research on this, or if you have an HDR program like Photomatix, you know that you need -2EV/+2EV to get a really good range.  I'm surprised Sony stopped so short here, since expanding the range would have been easy.  In fact, you can manually adjust the exposure by 2EV either way in Program Mode.But if you do this, you'll have to have a tripod, because you'll have to change the exposure each time.  There's no auto exposure bracketing, where one touch of the shutter takes three successive shots at your preset exposure range.  This is surprising, almost shocking, since AEB doesn't add to the cost.  If this were a middle-of-the-road compact selling for $150 the omission would be understandable, but the TX7 is supposed to be a top-of-the-line, full-featured, as-good-as-it-gets compact (it's certainly priced that way).  It makes you wonder just what the people at Sony were thinking when they designed this camera--it's hard to believe someone didn't bring this up.Sony makes up for this, though, with very good low-light performance.  First, Sony has traded lower MPs (10 vs. the 12 or 14 in most compacts) for better quality at higher ISOs, an excellent trade.  The TX7 beats every other compact except the Canon S90 at higher ISOs, and the Canon achieves this through a larger sensor and hence a larger camera.  You can see this for yourself by visiting [...] and comparing the full-size images of various cameras (as of this writing there are no samples for the TX7, but those for the TX5 would be identical).You will also see that there is no better compact than the TX7 on lens resolution.  This is quite surprising since the TX7's lens is so small. The suberb resolution by itself makes the price of this camera worthwhile.However, I did notice some purple fringing at the juncture of certain bright and dark parts of the image, which is due to the lens design.  But this is noticeable only at very high magnifications.The second way Sony addresses the  low-light problem is to offer two different low-light shooting modes:  Twilight Mode and Anti-Blur Mode.  Both take a series of six shots and then merge them into a single image--in other words, you get six times the amount of light that you'd get with a straight shot.  The Twilight Mode uses slower shutter speeds and lower ISOs, while Anti-Blur does the opposite.  Also, the white balance on the Twilight Mode is distinctly warm, no doubt to compensate for the bluish light in twilight or early morning scenes.What if you want to use the Twilight Mode indoors under incandescent lighting so you can get the lower ISO?  You'd want to do this if you didn't need the higher shutter speed that Anti-Blur gives.  To avoid an overly-warm image simply switch the white balance from auto to incandescent and you'll be fine.Which leads me to the touchscreen, which has turned out to be my favorite feature on the TX7.  Changing the white balance, and doing anything else, is quick and easy with the touchscreen.  I've seen some reviews which say that you have to use the supplied stylus, but I've never had to.  Plus, the text and icons are very readable and even elegant in appearance.In fact, the overall build of the camera is quite good.  You might even say luxurious.  This is an expensive camera for a compact, but it looks and feels expensive.The panorama feature is interesting, but a bit gimmicky.  You can do panoramas yourself in Photoshop or other editors in those few occasions when you need a panorama, which in my experience isn't very often.  Plus, when you take your own pictures for subsequent integration into a panorama each shot is separately (and hence correctly) exposed.  Not so with the Panorama Mode on the TX7.  When you press the shutter the exposure is set for the entire panorama, so if you begin in an area that is a lot lighter or darker than the rest of the scene your integrated shot won't be properly exposed.  However, you can adjust for this by using the AE lock.I'm not a Scene Mode fan, but if you are this camera's for you.  There's even a Gourmet Mode (for taking pictures of food), a Beach Mode, and a Pet Mode.  OK, say you're spending a day at the beach and you want to take a particularly cute shot of your dog eyeing a hamburger.  What to do?  Beach Mode?  Pet Mode?  Gourmet Mode?  You could make a case for any of them.  While you're dithering over this the moment has passed.  Just take the damn picture!The TX7 has a Burst Mode, for taking up to 10 shots in rapid succession.  How rapid this is depends on the three choices the TX7 gives to you.  At first I thought that this was a bit over-the-top, but in actual use I've liked having the three different rates.  It's hard to explain, but in some action scenes it's better to have one over the other.  Be careful with this feature, though.  It's easy to load up lots and lots of images that are a pain to go through.The camera has a limited zoom range, but it's a good one: an effective 25mm through 100mm.  Yes, 100mm isn't much of a telephoto, but remember that you can always crop.  You can't make a photo any wider than the widest zoom range on the camera, and as far as I know there's no compact which gets any wider than 25mm.  Moreover, there's no distortion at this focal length.  My previous compact, a Canon SD700IS purchased in 2007, goes out to only 35mm and has pronounced barrel distortion at that setting.  This is another huge plus for the TX7.Most reviews mention the short battery life, and that's indeed true.  Of course, that's the price you pay for a tiny camera like this.What Sony should have done is to enable recharging through the dock.  As you probably know, there is no direct cable from the TX7 to your computer.  Instead, Sony provides a dock.  You set the camera in the dock, and then transfer the pictures.  Some reviewers have complained about having this separate item, but I found it slightly more convenient than inserting a cable.  As I said, though, it would be great if the camera could be recharged through the dock.  My first compact, a Fuji I got in 2002, did this, so I don't see why Sony does not.One last thing:  I purchased what is described as the \"blue\" model.  This is a joke.  The camera is jet black.  There's not even the slightest hint of blue.Overall, the TX7 is a great camera.  It's small size, especially the slim profile, means you can easily slip into your pocket, even your shirt pocket.  If in the next generation Sony expands the HDR, provides for AEB, and allows charging through the dock it will have close to a perfect little camera. This is interesting.  My first TX7 produced significant flare in backlit scenes.  Flare creates milky areas or streaks in the image, and is caused by stray light bouncing around inside the lens.

Dell \"Dell\"", "ReviewID": "R3OA09J0K59KL", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I am not going to list all the features of this camera; you can read the details in the description. I will only write a review from my personal experiences.I have an older Olympus 4mp camera and wanted to update to a better one. After reading all the positive reviews, I decided on this Sony DSC-TX7. I was hoping for a simple point-and-shoot that I did not have to think about, but just use. Well, it did not quite turn out that way with this camera.I discovered that the Intelligent Auto Mode worked well under normal lighting conditions. However, when I used it indoors under low light, or outside on a cloudy day or late evening, then the Auto Mode only worked sometimes. So, I began to experiment and I suggest you do the same thing.I used the camera under less than perfect circumstances by first using the Auto Mode. Then I took 2 or 3 more photos of the same scene using different manual modes. I did this on indoor low lighting, back lit objects, cloudy days, night time, etc. What I found is that most of the time you have to use a certain manual mode to get the right picture. Plus, the manual mode to use was different in each lighting condition. This may sound time consuming and complicated, but it really is not. After just a few hours I had most of the optimal settings memorized.Once you figure out the best setting, the camera takes great pictures.  With the micro mode you can get extremely close to the subject and the photo is super clear and sharp. The panoramic mode works well, once you figure it out. The manual just says not to move the camera too fast or too slow, but does not give you any idea just how fast or slow that is. I found the best way is to count from 4 to 7 seconds. Depending on how fast or slow you count, that should give you a good panoramic photo.I like the touch screen. It is easy to use and responsive. The battery life is a little short compared to other cameras. I just ordered another battery so that I would always have a charged battery ready to go. The video mode quality is average at best. I tried using the video on the highest HD setting indoors under normal lighting conditions and the video was grainy. My older video camera actually did a better job under the same conditions, but the Sony video shinned in brighter light.Overall this camera does a great job if you take the time to figure out how to use it. But, it is not perfect. My 2mp camera in my cell phone does almost as good on a panoramic photo. And my Olympus 4mp photos look almost as good as this Sony. I took a few pictures with the Olympus and Sony of the same scene and I was hard pressed to tell any difference in quality until I zoomed in on the pictures. That was when I could tell that the Sony was a little clearer. I also ask a friend which photos looked better. Most of the time he picked the Olympus photos as being better. I am use to the Olympus and I think once I spend more time and practice more, then I will be able to get better results with the Sony.So, here is the bottom line with my experiences:The good:1. Several manual modes come in handy under less than ideal conditions.2. Picture quality is great when settings are correct.3. The large touch screen makes previewing much easier.4. The touch screen is about as responsive as the iPhone and easy to use.5. The compact size of the camera make is very convenient to carry.6. The panoramic mode works well and has 2 size settings.7. Outdoor night time photos with very little light are amazing with the right setting.The bad:1. Be aware this is not as simple to use as you might think except under normal conditions.2. The latch cover holding the battery comes open easily.3. The touch screen gets smudged quickly so get a screen protector.4. Photo quality is mostly noticeably if cropping or zooming in. Otherwise, a 4mp camera's photos look almost as good.The Sony has many more features that I like compared to my old camera.  And the Sony does take good photos. Therefore, I am going to keep learning and keep taking dozens of pictures until I get it right. For example, I played with different modes and was able to get much clearer pictures indoor without any noise at all. Practice and experiment is the key.", "Date": "March 4, 2010"}, {"Title": "The Best of this Series..in many ways", "Author": "M.

The Cybershot TX7 has more pleasing images, sharpness, FAR better stereo sound with clear-crisp sound capture. I am totally impressed with the TX 7 from other models released and in my opinion, this is Sony's winner !  Granted, other models may have perfected the HDMI issue by having a direct connector from camera, may have improved some barrel images when shooting video, but the sound lacks seriously, shutter time lags, response time are very serious things to consider.

I've gotten a good picture (without flash) in the light of only a small candle. (see in con section the occasional downside to this)- Touch screen is very responsive. It's very nice and easy to use.- Great quality pictures and video. Top notch in the genre of cameras that this model falls under.- Nicely built. The camera is very compact and dense. Sleek looking and feels good in the hand.- A plethora of options. Some are very, very cool. These can be a bit overwhelming (to the inexperienced) at first, but there's always the \"easy mode\" to rely on until you get the hang of it.- Good flash. Bright.- Optical zoom, though only x4, is good, and the camera is good at focusing at this range.Cons:- Though the camera is great in low-light situations like parties and the like, in some modes (such as hdr correction where the camera automatically takes and combines two pictures at different exposures to make for the best overall single picture--primarily used for low-light situations) when the target is moving or fidgeting the picture can come out really bizarre looking. This is just one example of needing to become accustomed to the camera. Each setting has it's own optimal use, and can produce great results; however, you can expect in the first couple of days/weeks to get a few weird pics amongst the good ones while you learn which mode is best in which situation.**Overall a really, really superb camera.

Vera", "ReviewID": "RFW5N00VXGSD0", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I have been using the Sony DSC series since the DSC-S70, the camera that got me to quit shooting film. I have bought a few more in the series along the way, and this DSC-TX7 replaced a DSC-W290, which is an incredible value. I had always wanted something smaller and ventured into the smaller Sony models when the DSC-T1 came out but I was disappointed at how hard it was to shoot it unless you left it at full auto. This was one of the very last of the series that came without some kind of vibration reduction, and the camera was so small that it was close to impossible to get a decent shot unless you leaned against something for support. Since my W290 already had vibration reduction, I knew the technology worked and I decided to make the jump to the DSC-TX7 as soon as the TX9 was announced, which made its price drop by about $50. For less than what I was hoping to spend on the TX7 I was able to score the TX7, a microSD card (more on that later) and a fantastic Amazon Basics leather case.The good:It is simply incredible. If you can point a camera at something, you know everything that you need in order to take great photos. Just put it in intelligent auto mode and let it rip. The rest of the modes are just icing on the cake. This is a great camera to carry everywhere, the form factor is almost identical to a credit card, and it is not very thick. The Amazon Basics leather case that I got was dirt cheap ($8 or so) and it is simply perfect for this because I can keep it on my belt.If you are interested in more creative control, there is a lot of stuff that you can play with, but it will never come close to a real \"prosumer\" camera. This camera is mostly designed for women to carry in a small purse or for men to drop it in a pocket, so their main selling point is the size. That said, for something so small it is very powerful and versatile. If photography is your hobby and size is not the main concern, there is an equivalent to this camera in the DSC-W series that will match or surpass it while being cheaper.The not so good:It isn't perfect. The menus take a while to get used to, regardless of how much you are convinced that you know what you are doing. It took me days to realize that even if I switched it to AVCHD, it was not shooting at 1920x1080. It took me even longer to figure out how to consistently switch back and forth between AVCHD and MP4 and the different form factors. The low light performance is there, but don't expect it to be noise free. You get some and you lose some.That's the only stuff I can complain about. I really love this camera!As I mentioned before, I opted for a microSD card instead of a Sony memory stick. The reason I did this is because my last two cell phones have had a microSD slot, this means I can shoot content, move it to my cell phone and transmit it from there, instead of having to wait until I get to my laptop. The class 6 microSD card cost me a lot less than a what I paid for the Sony Memory Stick pro duo mark 2 of the same size that I bought for my DSC-W290.The panorama mode works. It is not perfect, but it works. The best performance I have seen so far is if the light changes are not drastic, otherwise it seems to be trying to compensate for it too much. It is one of the \"wow\" features of the camera, and everyone I have shown the panoramas was shocked to learn that these were generated on the spot by the camera, and not by manipulation in the computer. One of the things that weren't obvious in Sony's advertising is that there are two aspect ratios available to do this, if you opt for the most extreme ratio you can sweep a wider arc. You can also shoot panoramas vertically, which creates some cool illusions if you use this feature too close to a building.The speed shutter can consistently take 10 frames per second, and you are able to cancel it in the middle of the write phase. I took some bursts of a moving fan and the auto focus did not get confused by the blades, it focused on the protective rack and everything came into focus properly without any funny artifacts.The macro on this camera is AWESOME. I spent DAYS taking macros of whatever little thing landed on my desk, I simply couldn't stop.HD video: Don't bother shooting AVCHD with this camera if you are only interested in dumping your videos to Youtube. I experimented with this camera extensively, and I can't tell the difference between what I shot in the two AVCHD modes and what I shot in the two MP4 modes, so now I am only shooting 720p MP4. The highest mode for AVCHD is spectacular when you see it through the HDMI to a proper HDTV, but it is simply a waste of time to shoot it to send to Youtube unless you want your archival copy to be at the highest possible resolution and quality.  Editing AVCHD can be a problem too, but there are enough workarounds posted online so it shouldn't be too terrible.I would not hesitate to recommend this camera to anyone that is interested in a similar feature set as the Sony DSC-W290 but with better video, better sensor, no protruding lens and the ability to use non-memory stick media. If you don't need SD, and protruding lenses aren't an issue, then you should be looking at the DSC-W290 or something more recent: the way Sony releases the DSC series, there are always one W camera and one TX camera that have really close specifications and capabilities.", "Date": "August 29, 2010"}, {"Title": "LOVE this camera.

The T9 is so familiar to us by now it's really an extension of my hand, but we're trying to look objectively at the TX7.Good (mostly comparing TX7 and the earlier T9)1) The new low light feature is incredible.  It takes several pictures in a second in light almost too dim to see anything, and merges them (over 2 seconds) into a single picture that is very good.  So this is a huge improvement over early generation cameras, as long as the dim object is not moving.2) The widest angle lens is a good deal wider than this series of camera a few years ago.3) The panorama mode is neat - it feels like you are taking a movie for 2-3 seconds as you pan horizontally, but the product is a very long photo.3) The movie function is much improved.  I would say it is about as good as the Kodak Zi8, which is usually reviewed as good as or better than a Flip.  You can zoom during movies.5) Overall, especially in challenging conditions, consistently somewhat sharper and better than the T9.Less good1) Movies - The marketing makes a big fuss over HD mode movies, but makes it sound like it's a huge pain to transfer its internal HD movies to any kind of DVD format (for mailing to relatives).  The regular format movies copy onto DVDs with some run of the mill shareware we have.  The format is H264 so they should drag and drop on Ipods, I think.2) Picture formats. We always used our T9 (6MB max) storing 2MB photos, which seems a great balance between size and quality for us (fine for 4x6, 5x7 prints).  For the 4x6 format, the new TX7 has a low resolution \"VGA\" mode (100kb) but then jumps up to 5MB as the next 4x6 format.  What?  5mb is overkill for routine prints (slow to move around, fills up hard drive, web upload, memory card, etc).  The TX7 has an intermediate resolution mode of 2MB but only in the 16x9 format. I think a lot of people still use 4x6 and 5x7 prints, so I wish there was a storage format between 100kb and 5mb.3) Size - It's a bit larger and heavier than the T9, but of course it's still a pretty small camera.4) eZoom - It has an electronic zoom that exceeds the 1-4x optical zoom, but buries it in a sub menu, and restrains it alot \"to preserve quality\".  Well, duh, it's virtual zoom, of course there is some effect on quality.  Anyway, in the 5MB picture mode it gives you 1-4X optical zoom, and then up to 5x (wow, one extra X) with e-zoom.

Since I expect them to last a long time, I do a lot of research. I was looking for a touch screen, something that was compact, and something that was highly rated. This camera met all those criteria. I have had it now for about 10 months, and I couldn't be happier.The camera is very easy to use, and the fact that there is a touch screen means that you get a large viewing area even on such a small camera. It has quick on/off by sliding the front cover down/up, and the camera operation is pretty quick, too. The default shooting mode is really great, as it is very good at adapting to your environment, so much so that I don't often switch shooting modes. However, there are a couple other modes that come in handy in some situations. The motion (anti-blur) mode is fantastic. Even when you or something else is moving at high speeds, it produces very good, clear pictures. The other great mode is the panorama mode (I can only compare it to the panorama mode on my old Canon where I had to take the pictures then later \"stitch\" them together with software on a computer). This panorama mode works very well, and I use it all the time to produce great skyline shots or shots within a structure (e.g., Colosseum and Pantheon for me). You simply press the shutter and move the camera. There are also some great auto-shoot modes (one that detects a smile -- it works -- and one that can detect when one or two people are in the picture, among some others).The camera comes with a rechargeable battery and a compact charger. The battery has a pretty good life. I could take it out for a whole day of sightseeing with no problems.

The camera's best feature is the HD movie mode. The quality is outstanding for such a tiny camera in this price range. I was very impressed. Another thing that struck me about this camera was just how small it is! Even after seeing it on dozens of Youtube videos I just wasn't able to grasp how small it is. Tiny!! At first I thought it might be too tiny. But now that I've played around with it for a week, I actually like its size.The snapshots pictures are very good, but I wouldn't say 'fantastic.' I was replacing a 9 year old Cyber-shot DSC-P72 and there wasn't all THAT much difference in picture quality. Main thing is the color saturation in better on the TX7. But to me, I will mainly be using this camera for HD movies - the highest quality mode is definitely leaps and bounds better than all the others.For still picture taking, I find it quite odd that the camera has this very good AUTO mode, yet I guess if you don't 'trust' it, you can go in and manually select the scene mode, like if you want landscape, twilight, beach, snow, etc. I find it's best to just let the camera automatically pick the best settings.I really like the interface on the camera. Very easy to navigate and laid out very well. The 'Easy mode' is overkill. It's alreay plenty easy to use in 'Intelligent mode.'Battery life is decent... it's not as bad as some people make it out to be. But I'd say definitely pick up an extra battery.Once thing to watch out for is that since the lense of the camera is not in the middle, it's very easy to get your finger in the way (expecially when shooting video) if you're not careful.The included software allows you to trim and merge HVCHD movie clips. But I decided to get Pinnacle Studio HD 15 for a more professional look to the movies I create.Oh another thing. This camera is not blue, it's black.It also has a lot of cool features like burst and panoramic mode which I myself will probably never use, but may be useful to some people.The macro mode is impressive, while I found the low light feature to only be so-so for picture taking.

It is such a fun camera to use and the touch screen is a no brainer to figure out.  The large screen is what really sold me, love to review the photos taken and show to others on the big screen.  The anti-blurr feature really works!  Took photos traveling in the car at 60 mph and they came out amazing!  I wanted a small camera I could take anywhere and although not the smallest, it is small enough to put in a pocket or small purse.  Like I said before, it is so fun to use, felt like I had a new toy, BUT, the drawback, is simply the quality of the photos.  I bought the tiny little Canon SD1400is and took comparison photos with it and the Sony, side by side.  The Sony, if it needs to use the flash, distorts the color, making people come out much redder than they are, sometimes their faces come out natural enough but their shoulders and chests would be very very red.  Also, low light photos just do not come out well at all.  The Canon outperformed the Sony by far when it comes to natural looking photos and good flash.  If you just want a scenery camera and aren't that concerned about photo quality, then this camera is great.  Although, if I wanted a camera primarily for scenery, I would get one with a lot better zoon than this one.  I ended up returning the Sony and keeping the little Canon, which I am going to buy a waterproof housing for with the left over money from the return (along with an extra battery!).  Sony needs to do something about the over saturation of color on this camera and it would be worth the money but as it is right now, I was very dissapointed.  The Canon lacks the big screen and anti blurr but has fun features like black and white, sepia, or black and white with one color options.  Sony should have put that on their $400 camera as well.

The Zeiss Tessar lens is very luminous and one of my favourite optics, however in this camera, a very high number of the images turn out distorted.  This may be due to the camera's capability to go from macro to regular portrait to panoramic in a jiffy, however it is quite a let down to see this happen. Perhaps this can be avoided but I guess it will take some time to master.The luminosity of the lens makes it possible to shoot in the dimmest light and get great results.2. Portability is delicious, with the light camera fitting in a pocket.3. I picked it because it uses the same memory stick pro that other Sony products use -and I have way too many to switch to something else- however, when I tried to use a previously used mem stick, i got a message stating that the images would NOT be readable!! -not a good thing-4. Its connectivity is very much a disaster.  To download jpeg files, you can use a regular card reader, however, if you wish to download HD video, one MUST use the included cradle and program which is compatible ONLY WITH WINDOWS!?!?!?! If you wish to use a MAC, it is imperative that you have the latest version of IMOVIE or you get the Pro version of Quicktime. -Both at an extra expense- I work on Final Cut Pro and the camera is not compatible with last year's version. If you wish to use previous versions of these programs on a MAC, you must NOT use the HD feature -which is one of the very reasons to buy this camera-.In a world which is run on MAC to a very large scale, it is about time Sony would think of compatibility.The camera has a sort of 'blue-tooth' transfer device which works only with VAIO computers, which you can understand because they are trying to sell you an extra gadget, but there is no point in paying for extra bells and whistles which you can't actually benefit from. Sony ought to make a plug in or program to make it work with MAC without having to buy new expensive software.5. Battery life turned out to be better than I expected, but it runs out quite fast if you review every picture or video you take.6. I still don't see why this 'wonder' would go with less megapixels (10.2) than its sister the DSC-W220 which has 12 MP. However, when images are so distorted, MPs hardly matter.Overall, this is a good camera, but I regret having bought it instead of a less sophisticated but more compatible one. I believe -or rather hope- that future models would repair these flaws.Last comment is towards Amazon and not the product.

For daytime photos and videos, this camera does a great job. For flash photos, I am getting white glare spots all over my photos that can't even be edited out with editing software. SONY customer service told me that because the lens is so close to the flash on this camera, the flash actually illuminates dust particles in the air and those get picked up in your images. It's basically a design defect in the camera and their only solution was to shoot in high sensitivity mode.

It's an upgrade there should be no reason that I can think of for the bass sounding so bad & no previous problems with the W290 and they said no.  Then Sony told me to format my card.  I did and other than getting more space I still have the same audio.  What am I doing wrong here?  I also know that the W290 is a mono and the TX7 is a stereo.I must admit video and pictures are amazing!!!!  Professional quality I may even say.  But what is up with the audio?  I really do love both cameras.Thank you for the help.  The only thing I can think of is the 32 memory sticks are either bad or not compatible with the camera which the Sony rep told me they were.", "Date": "June 25, 2010"}, {"Title": "Look Elsewhere for Quality Images", "Author": "Freezer Boy", "ReviewID": "R1RU590XU0J6WM", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "A) Cameras costing 1/3 the price have greater control over photo settings and equal or better image quality. Want to leave the shutter open for 2 seconds and set the f-stop--you can't do it with this camera. I can do that with my old $99 Samsung L 200 digital pocket camera. Sony's available adjustments (white balance, ISO, etc) provide some control but the resulting images still didn't impress me. I was so disappointed with the image quality of the still photos that I have passed this camera along to a friend who was interested in the camera's movie capabilities. This camera's MP4 and AVCHD movies are better-than-average for a compact digital camera except for the lens distortion. The camera does indeed have lens distortion--especially at the corners as seen on the LCD display. Some of the distortion is easily missed in photos and videos but in some images it stands out like a sore thumb. For full HD video, there are plenty of other quality options at a cheaper price.B) The battery life was way way way too short. Add the cost of an additional battery to your final cost. Or take my advice and don't buy the camera.C) An adapter stand (docking station) is used to connect the camera to a PC/TV and a separate battery charger is used to charge the battery. More stuff to lug around. Sony should ditch the docking station and allow battery recharging in the camera with a USB connection to plug/car/pc.D) Accessories, as one might expect from Sony, are overpriced. Sony makes a waterproof housing that costs you only $249.00 from Sony. There doesn't seem to be a Sony-made protective bumper wrap (I drop stuff all the time). You can connect the camera's docking station to a Standard Definition (SD) TV with the supplied AV cable. HD TV cables are NOT supplied with the camera. You can buy them. I did like the option of using either a standard SD memory card or the Sony Memory Stick.E) The panorama photos rarely produced acceptable results--poor image quality, mostly. It's a fun & useful feature when it works (it does work, just not as well as hoped for); nonetheless, I would prefer to shoot several still shots and stitch them together manually with software.F) The camera is heavy which hopefully means it is well built and will withstand accidental abuse. Hard to say since I didn't drop it or bang it into something. It does feel like it could easily slip out of your hands since it has a very smooth slippery finish. The supplied hand strap should prevent such mishaps.G) The interface is fairly simple to navigate. Some of Sony's settings may appear poorly organized within its menu system; but once found, they're easy to re-find and adjust. I don't like cameras that take too much time to process and store images--this camera is too slow for me. Also, the touch-screen interface seems a tad slow for some functions. Burst mode works well but the images seem degraded. What you want to capture may pass you by due to the slow response of the camera when not shooting in burst mode. And after shooting in burst mode, you must wait for the camera to store images. The PDF manual is a useful read and explains all the camera's features. The supplied PC software is acceptable and handles basic needs like trimming a video and burning a DVD. It doesn't work with 64-bit editions of Windows XP. All of the camera's movie formats opened up in my version of Window's Movie Maker and Adobe Premiere Elements 8.0. Google's Picasa 3 didn't open the AVCHD videos.H) Each AVCHD movie (m2ts extension) has 2 data files associated with it. Each MP4 file seems to have 3 data files associated with it. I can do without them--I think--and would like to have that option.I) I must be color blind because my \"Blue\" camera looks like a deep black color to me.J) Plenty of nifty features, settings & options within the very readable and usable touch-screen interface, but without a high quality image, who cares?", "Date": "October 23, 2010"}, {"Title": "Best Quality compact Camera I've used.", "Author": "R.
