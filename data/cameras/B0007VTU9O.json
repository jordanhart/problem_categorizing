Borroto", "ReviewID": "ROPBUHT6WMFJK", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "After much deliberation and research, given I was about to shell out over 300 bucks, I went with the Sony DSC-S90. I won't go on and on about specifications since you can read them for yourselves.  But after using this camera for almost one week, I have found it to be very easy to use, it gives you great looking pictures (thanks to  Carl Zeiss and 4.1 megapixels), and it even takes MPEG movies. The HUGE 2.5 inch LCD screen is bright and clear, and you're given the option to use the optical viewfinder. A handy feature in bright sunlight.The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars was because of the lackluster design of the data/video/audio cable. It plugs into the bottom of the camera, which means you have to lay it on it's back (the LCD side, ouch!) or its front (the lens side, double ouch!!). I'd hate to damage or scratch either of these, although in all fairness, the lens is closed during file transfer process.I'd recommend this beauty, but get yourself at least a 256 Meg Memory Stick Pro, a small carrying case, and add those to the price.  ENJOY!!", "Date": "April 14, 2005"}, {"Title": "Excellent if you like large LCDs, otherwise the DSC-S60 is better value", "Author": null, "ReviewID": "R10TQ0RIDJD5LY", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "I work in the Camera department at Best Buy. I personally own a Sony camera, last year's DSC-P73, which was the 4-megapixel \"little brother\" to the 5-megapixel DSC-P93. The P73 and P93 have been replaced with this year's models, the DSC-S60 and DSC-S90. This time around, they're both shooting at a 4-megapixel resolution.The DSC-S90 offers an excellent starter package, including the rechargable batteries (the midline S60 no longer ships with rechargable batteries like my P73 did).So if I love this camera so much, what prevents it from getting 5 stars?It lost one star for the batteries. Sony's higher end models use lithium ion battery packs, which offer longer battery life and allow for a smaller camera. The difference in potential size was most pronounced last year - compare the DSC-P93 and DSC-P100, which were essentially the same camera except for the P100 shipping with a Carl Zeiss Vario Tessar lens and a lithium battery pack. The P100, while the same overall shape, was much slimmer due to the small rectangular battery pack.The other star? Value. Working in retail, value is a concept you find is very important to customers. The price of the DSC-S90 averages (among several retailers) about $40 to $50 higher than the DSC-S60. The two models differ in only two respects: 1) the larger screen on the DSC-S90 and 2) the inclusion of NiMH AA batteries and a charging unit with the DSC-S90. However, Sony sells an accessory kit which includes the same batteries and charger as the DSC-S90, plus a Sony carrying case, for $40. Due to the smaller size of the DSC-S60's LCD, the same batteries will last longer... so for the same price, you get a camera which doesn't drain batteries as quickly and which comes with a carrying case... as long as you can stand the 2\" instead of 2.5\" screen.

Not only is this one of the best cameras in its class it includes decent software and rechargeable batteries that are at least a 20$ value.HIGHLY reccomend over canon,kodak, and fuji.

Don's review appears to be from a person that is not experienced with camera's. The quality of the pictures will only come out as good as the ability of the user's knowledge to adjust the settings. I have taken pictures indoors without flash and they come out excellent but this required manual changes. The camera even has a shutter speed of 30 seconds which is awesome because most cameras out there only have anywhere from 4-15 seconds. 30 seconds will allow anyone to take pictures at 80 ISO and capture any type of light. For any person looking to purchase this camera, I highly recommend that you read the online \"professional reviews\" from camera review sites. This camera is highly recommended and is a serious competitor against Canon's A520 which this camera was more than likely made to compete against.

On paper it looked great, with the huge lcd and great movie mode making it stand out from its competitors (I also looked at Canons and Kodaks in this price range). BUT...After receiving the camera, I started taking pics of my kids around the house, and the results were terrible. The subject in front of the camera was far too bright, and the background far too dark. Red eye was quite bad, several pics were inexplicably blurry (in auto flash mode, not in any manual setting!) and to top it off, the pictures had a yellowish tint, almost as if taken in sepia, though they were not.Granted, these pics were taken at night under indoor lighting, not ideal conditions. So I did a comparison with our old camera, 4-year-old, 2MP, Kodak DX3600, taking several flash photos of people under the same conditions. And lo and behold, the cluncky old Kodak gave much more pleasing results than the shiny new Sony, with better colors, less blur, less red-eye, and a more balanced exposure of subject and background.So this camera's going back. I haven't even tried it outdoors in daytime, since I take quite of few of my pics indoors and need a camera that can turn in a decent performance under those conditions.A few other somewhat annoying things:1. camera size is a little small for me and it did not feel very solid in my hands.2. There is a \"red-eye reduction\" flash mode, but to turn it on or off you have to cycle through a whole bunch of menus, rather than have it available at the touch of a button, as (again) it is on our old Kodak. And when you do finally turn it on, you sometimes still get red-eye.3. The USB cable connects to the bottom of the camera (!) meaning that as you transfer pics to the PC you have to lay it down either on the lens side or on the lcd side, and it's quite awkward. Presumably it's down there so it can also connect to the Sony cradle (sold separately). But again, the old Kodak does a better job, since it has BOTH a connector on the bottom if you have the cradle, and also one on the side, if you don't.In short, there's less to this camera than meets the eye, and I'm back to the drawing board.", "Date": "August 13, 2005"}, {"Title": "for the guy that doesn't know how to take pictures...", "Author": "claudiomarcelo \"claudiomarcelo2\"", "ReviewID": "R3CKMYBHLAXX1Y", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Above , a customer Cambridge Don, complaint that this camera is awful for taking pictures with flash.....and gave this camera two starswell obviously he doesn't know how to take pictures with digital cameras This camera as well as any of its kind example Canon Powershot \"do not need\" any flash for even very low lighting conditions and the pictures come out awesome....In fact indoors is better just \"not to use flash\" at all...So first learn how to take a picture before giving a bad rating....", "Date": "December 17, 2005"}, {"Title": "The best camera I have ever owned", "Author": "Football Mom", "ReviewID": "R3AN3ZQ48UPZ9M", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I was given this camera for Christmas in 2005, and have never been happier.

I just want to take cute pictures of my daughter! I had a fairly high end fuji for all of 4 months before problems started occuring- we were getting weird waving lines in all of our pictures- they standed out more in daylight.  And things got worse from there.  Instead of going through all the fuss of repair, we decided to just get a new cheaper camera.  I decided to go with Sony because of the great name and reputation- and it was a great decision.  I just got this one last week and was taking pictures right out of the box.  I got at 512 mb memory stick and carrying case, and an extra set of rechargable batteries.A nice feature is the inboard memory- in case your memory stick gets full or misplaced you can take a few pictures. You will probably want to get only SONY batteries to with this as I read in a review that it does much better with it's own brand batteries.The pictures come out very clear- a problem we had with the fujij was shaky pictures no matter how still you were, and if your subjects were moving (as 2 year olds tend to do) forget it.  The SONY is so much better- even pictures while she was running came out crystal clear. We did 1 month of intense research before finally deciding to buy this one. I think it was well worth the wait!

That cable, if lost, is ridiculously expensive, like $80 or something. My Canon DSLR uses a simple USB cable to do the same job.The camera requires a Sony Memory Stick Pro for additional memory. I bought a 2GB card when I bought the camera. These are different cards from the Memory Stick Pro Duo cards.I still have this camera. I don't use it anymore, but I am still amazed at the features Sony packed into this 2005 model. The video feature and the 2.5 inch real time LCD is nice, again, no big deal nowadays, but in 2005 was a bit ahead of its time.

Besides the 150$ offer price that I paid for it, it is a great camera (of course, it's a Sony), specially for photo amateurs like me. I've been using for about four months and I'm very satisfied with it. Let's start with the pros:- 4.1 MP for great pictures at maximum resolution (and 4.1 is enough for me)- 2.5 inch, clear, bright, crisp (huge!) LCD screen- If you equip a Memory Stick Pro, you can take camcorder-like video (I can take approx. 3 minutes of high-quality video with a 256 MB Memory Stick)- It comes with powerful rechargeable batteries (charger included), which last enough for, say..., a birthday party, although I recommend buying an extra pair.- Numerous shooting modes for a variety of lighthing conditions. It also has a Manual mode for those pros that know how tweak lens and camera settings.- Sturdy construction, excellent Sony design.Now, the cons:- Hmmm... I guess a couple of things that annoy me is the time it takes for the camera to recharge between two shots in automatic mode (about 3 seconds) and the other thing is that the USB cable to connect the camera to the CPU is propietary on the camera's end, and now I think I lost the cable, and will probably have to buy a new one.

I bought it for 3 reasons:* Ease of use* Ability to take pics in the dark* Decent video w/ sound (works reasonably well in low light)Based on these criteria alone, the DSC-S90 is a home run.  The other features are nice, like the big LCD and rechargeable AA batteries w/ charger.  I splurged on a 1G memory stick pro Ultra II and don't regret it at all.  The high res video takes lots of memory.

One thing I always hated was lugging it around though. Not to mention the wait as I had pictured developed.I recently purchased this camera, my first digital one, after reading some reviews of it. The fact that it featured a Carl Zeiss lens was the ultimate selling point with me. Those are the same great ones we use in our lab for high resolution microscope photos. The optics are clean and crisp.As expected, this lens is fantastic as well as the camera itself. It's a compact size and much easier to carry around than my old Nikon SLR. It's built in zoom lens is handy to get close up shots. I like that there are flash modes to choose from also. There seems to be little or no lag time necessary between photos either (as was noted in the reviews of other similar cameras).It's been an easy camera to learn how to use in basic modes. There are many other functions I'm just getting to now. It sure is nice to be able to quickly scan and delete photos you don't want also.This takes gorgeous, true color, clear photos. Even when the images are enlarged they retain their quality.I highly recommend this camera and am totally pleased with my purchase.", "Date": "March 15, 2006"}, {"Title": "4.1 mega pixs", "Author": "Robert W.
