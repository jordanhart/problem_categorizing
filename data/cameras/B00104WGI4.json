{"Reviews": [{"Title": "It was okay", "Author": "Pitabug", "ReviewID": "R2OITQA1KFZLYK", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "I got this camera as a gift for my birthday. I'm really interested in photography.So my parents thought this would be a good gift for me, but sadly they didn't look into any features, just the color. So I have found the camera to be troublesome.There are many problems I've found. One would be that it goes through batteries very quickly. I'm a college student so I don't have a lot of money to spend on batteries so it's a hassle. Another issue is the camera takes a pretty awful picture if flash is not used. It makes the pictures really distorted. The shutter speed is pretty slow as well, so taking action shots is not good for this camera. Also, the menu to change certain settings are very very limited. For example, I can't change the light exposure (tried this in hope to be able to take pictures outside to counteract the flash) or shutter speed.However, with all the negatives aside there are a few postives. Such as the nice color it comes in, amount of megapixels, the price, video, and cropping features. The megapixels for this camera are pretty decent, especially considering the inexpensive price. There is a nice little video feature where the camera also picks up audio. Another fun feature with this camera is you can crop a picture using the camera itself and you can put the picture in fun tones, such as black and white, sepia, blue, red, etc.Overall, this camera is pretty decent for someone who isn't worried about perfect pictures or isn't that into photography in the long run. This camera can take some gorgeous pictures, just it can take some time. This is a good camera for what it costs, and if anyone plans on buying it, make sure to have a memory card. Because at most, this camera can hold around 4 to 8 pictures. But this is found in most digital cameras with a decent amount of mega pixels.", "Date": "May 12, 2009"}, {"Title": "Excellent for normal use!", "Author": "D", "ReviewID": "RRDVTY5NZMT2O", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I just got the camera because of the price and the color.for what it is...5 stars definitely.very small, comes with batteries,cables and even a silicone skin.I bought it to use for detailed up close pics of tiny objects for ebay.so no, not for me.But, for everyday pic taking of people and places...an excellent camera and a great deal for the money.I gave mine to my daughter and she loves it.A fabulous gift for a teenage girl!", "Date": "April 20, 2009"}, {"Title": "Polaroid i735 7 MP Digital Camera", "Author": "C.

Sanchez", "ReviewID": "RDTLPJAEQ6109", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "ITs true, that this camera doesn't come with a memory card, but I was able to find one on amazon.com for only $3 from sandisk. Now it holds about 700 pictures. The memory card fits really tight in the memory card slot and I actually had to remove the batteries to get the memory card out. So thats not easy to use. Also the menu and appearance of the camera make it seem like it could be a knock off camera. Thank goodness for the packaging that has polaroid all over it otherwise I would have sent this back. Nonetheless, I would recommend this camera for the price of $50. If you're gonna spend $150.00 like this camera was originally priced at, you're better off buying another brand.", "Date": "May 19, 2009"}, {"Title": "almost happy teenager", "Author": "Ralph Trepanier \"ralph t\"", "ReviewID": "R427IPXE09YRI", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "Well, a full featured camera, great capabilities, but burns through batteries at an alarming rate.

But it doesn't come with a memory card. Which is no big deal but....it only holds up to 4 pictures without a memory card. Which if you want a memory card thats another $15.00. And it is a battery eater. 5 minutes playing around with it and it shuts off because of no batteries. That's another $5.00 to $10.00. Then that gets you back up to the price of a normal digital camera. So don't jump on this camera because it is a good price. Becuase they still charge you for shipping. (Super Saver Shipping for over $20), you'll want a meomory card so you can take up to more than 4 pictures, and rechargable batteries. Other than that it is a wonderful camera!

I hoped this camera would take a bit better photos than a kid's camera, but not necessarily masterpieces.  This camera takes horrible photos.  When my daughter takes photos in the \"auto\" mode, they are almost always blurry and distorted.  I tried my hand at using the camera, and found that it was hit and miss whether I could get a good photo out of the camera.  For a 7 MP camera, the resolution of even the \"good\" photos is terrible.  All the photos were grainy.  Further, I have to change the batteries daily, and my daughter isn't taking a huge number of photos.  Yes, this is an inexpensive camera, but really it's just a cheap camera.
