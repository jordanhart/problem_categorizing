Sounds almost too good to be true.  So I googled the model number 16286187 and articles relating to a HS35 popped up.  Additionally, when you read the seller's \"more about this camera\" paragraph, it states that it is a HS35.  Please verify & correct so I know what you are selling, because I have my credit card ready if you tell me the $347.79 price is in fact for a HS50.  Thank you1/17/2014 UPDATE.....Thank you for the price correction. Your error made me do a little more research online and on Amazon. In lieu of a Fujifilm HS50 or HS35, I ended up purchasing a Fujifilm X-1s from Amazon. Its a fantastic camera. Better build quality with a real rubber body cladding (not the soft touch sprayed on stuff) over steel frame, smooth manual zoom lens, tons of auto and manual features, and its less expensive. Check it out!!", "Date": "January 15, 2014"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": null, "Features": null, "Name": null, "ImgURL": null, "ProductID": "B00EKMDN0I"}}
