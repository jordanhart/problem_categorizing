{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Sophisticated High-end camera", "Author": "Skoog", "ReviewID": "R36CHE3JGBWK2O", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I have four of these cameras monitoring my property.  The best image resolution is amazing, on the order of 1024x768, which is quite high for a security camera.  More feeds than you could ever use, set some to lower resolutions for cell phone access and whatnot.  Some of these cameras have been running non-stop for over three years without a single failure.For my setup, I monitor these via a DLink DNR-322L NVR, and although the DCS-7110 is not \"MyDlink\", I can view the camera through MyDlink (web access) by connecting to the MyDlink-compatible DNR-322L.The cameras are very reliable and have many features that I do not use.  The only issue I have with them is that configuration is difficult. I cannot seem to get the cameras to record on motion.  I've read the manuals and blogs, tried every variation I could devise, no joy.  Also cannot configure them to FTP their log files.  A small host of nits for which the root cause could be me, could be the camera design (all four have proven difficult with these topics).  I have intermittently gotten these cameras to record on motion, but it always disappears.  I work around this by having these four cameras set record always, to both NAS (network drive) and by the NVR.  Double assurance, but costly in terms of storage.  This works ok for my needs, since I have storage adequate for about 3 weeks before anything overwrites.  I use 3 of these cameras outside, where it is difficult to configure motion-detection adequately anyway due to street motion, shadows, bugs, etc...DLink Technical Support is essentially non-existent, so don't expect much there if you do run into issues.One thing to consider if you are a consumer interested in home security built around cameras similar to this one:  I am continually pestered by the City of Anaheim because I am an 80-percentile energy user. Since the house is empty 80% of the time, everything off, I have to assume the reason is the 15-odd security cameras, 2xNAS, 3xDVR/NVRs, and various router/switches running 24/7. Each piece of this network is a trivial power consumer, but summed up over constant use it adds up.  Anyway, these DCS-7110 cameras are pretty big cameras, probably significant contributors to your energy budget.", "Date": "August 10, 2013"}, {"Title": "excellent", "Author": "MichaelBrenden \"michael_brenden\"", "ReviewID": "RY60PZQM9KXN3", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "solid, well made, dependable, been working great.  will buy more when needed.  this was a starter/proof of concept, worked perfectly right away.", "Date": "March 13, 2014"}, {"Title": "DCS-5020L", "Author": "GaNews \"Georgia\"", "ReviewID": "R3631L08GATNCQ", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "Another reviewer got it right about Dlink: \"Customer support is virtually non-existent.\" I recently purchased their 810 Cloud router and DCS-5020L camera. Although the abbreviated version of instructions that were included with the units state that installation is simple and straightforward, right out of the box, that is not the case. And if you encounter any problem or question that might require support, you can forget it. Of the two questions I submitted to their 'help' support site, only one automated response was received. That auto response stated that they were reviewing my inquiry and would respond soon. That was two weeks ago. Have had no further contact from them and not even an auto email response to my second question. And don't be misled by the 'Chat' link on their 'customer support' website. that doesn't exist either. I had to purchase product support from another technical service provider to ever get the Dlink devices up and operating. Wish I had considered 'customer support' before I purchased their products.", "Date": "January 25, 2014"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": null, "Features": null, "Name": null, "ImgURL": null, "ProductID": "B004Z9YDHS"}}
