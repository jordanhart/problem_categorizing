Ricca", "ReviewID": "R2891MDQCL5G75", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "While camera set up was a little tasking I am disappointed more with the Multiview software. It is missing some of the advertized abilities such as email alerts only with some controls being greyed out and can't be used. It does not have any automatic trigger (motion) to take pictures and requires a lot of hard drive memory to store long survalence video. Hoping for an revision to the software but do not expect any.Overall, it is ok for manual short term remote viewing but falls short of a video security system.", "Date": "September 1, 2008"}, {"Title": "software doesn't work as advertised", "Author": "Kent Brooten \"Kent\"", "ReviewID": "RO5HUJI5WAO66", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I have been in contact with the company who produces this device (in Hong Kong).  I sent a detailed explanation (with graphics) showing how the software failed to work as advertised.  I found others who wrote reviews complaining of the same problem: it won't send emails when motion is detected.  They send me new drivers (didn't help) and send me of new CD (of the SAME version of the software).  the last time I asked if they were going to update the software, they apologized for the faulty hardware and suggested I return it to them for replacement.  It's clear they don't understand nor have they tested the software properly.If you want to monitor 4 video cameras, it works.  If you want the software to do everything as advertised, forget it.Kent", "Date": "March 11, 2009"}, {"Title": "Stay away!", "Author": "B. Holtappels", "ReviewID": "RBA85XXIIUCKB", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I bought this product for ugrading a perfectly working CCTV system from PCI (Connexant based) to USB. Turns out that after hours and hours of tweaking and downloading every driver that remotely had anything to do with it, I had to give up. It is built on the STK160 chipset made by Systek Taiwan, which is the only source for any driver and it does not meet even the very lowest quality standards.It does NOT work with ANY other Windows software except on channel 1 (it is a 4 channel device) WITHOUT AUDIO. It works only after reboot with no other apps running and eats up 100% of the CPU. The software that comes with it does work on more than 1 channel, but it is very crash happy and has almost no features, not even the basic ones. It is so bad that it is not worth anyone's time. Do yourself a favor and buy another product.I tried it on a Gigabyte P5 mainboard with Core 2 Duo and 2 GB RAM, XP SP2, and for reference on an IBM T41 laptop, with a fresh XP install with SP3. Same experience on both.I am currently considering the Swann Guardian, but am hesitant after this experience.", "Date": "January 23, 2009"}, {"Title": "Don't bother", "Author": "Corey", "ReviewID": "R3LG0W4SIIF1FH", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "This item comes at a great price but it's usability is horrible! First, the software doesn't do what it says, and if it does, good luck figuring out how! Second, if you think you can just bypass using the supplied (horrible) software written by a non-english speaking person, you're wrong (I was too). Windows DOES recognize this as a video device, just like a webcam - BUT, you will only get one channel and there are no other options available. I could go into more detail about what it does/doesn't do but to sum it up quickly, if you want a decent DVR system, this is not it. In fact, I'm surprised Amazon allows an item like this to be sold here.", "Date": "September 22, 2009"}, {"Title": "if you only care about cost, not time or quality, buy it", "Author": "B.
