The first time I picked it up, I knew it was a winner.  Mass storage, easy to use, and it doubles as an external superstor disk drive.  I love the burst mode for shooting  sports action. The 10 sec video mode works great also. The menus are easy  to acces and use, and the style of the camera makes it easy to hold and  control.  The ability to connect right to my tv and view my photos, makes  for a fun time and instant enjoyment.  Before I knew it I had taken over  180 photos, and never even came close to filling up the provided disk.  The  quality is great,and the LCD makes for great viewing. The only down side is  the 3x zoom, not quit enough zoom, but it does work well.  Other than that  -- I love it.", "Date": "June 28, 2000"}, {"Title": "One Great Camera", "Author": "Orville L. Cutright", "ReviewID": "R1MKL995Q1DS4X", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This is the greatest camera since pop corn! I love it. With it's multi settings, I have found it great for taking pictures while riding as a passenger in a car at speed of 50 MPH set on Burst Rec Mode up to 16 pictures in sequence all in focus 1 Picture every 0.5 sec. This setting is also good when you want to eliminate the flash. Zoom Mode is great as a quick copying for old pictures and much faster than a scanner and who carries a scanner with them? With all settings except for Burst Rec Mode you can record (SOUND CLIPS). Remember it uses up disk space. When visiting family and friends, this camera has a copy feature. So take extra disks. Take your pictures on the floppy, use copy mode and then you can save it on the super disk. Don't delete a part of a set of pictures as it will create a disk error if you do. Do your deleting after you down load to your computer.The soft ware that comes with the camera  can enhance the quality of your pictures when there is poor lighting or you want to crop to enhance the picture.Finally, the built in lens cover  feature alone would be my choice over the Sony without this feature.", "Date": "October 13, 2000"}, {"Title": "This Product is Truly Everything They Claim and More!", "Author": "Thomas J.

I was somewhat hesitant to purchase it because it is pricier than most on the market today coupled with the fact that my first camera was a $800.00 piece of junk.It isn't even necessary to read the instructions before you start. The camera uses a Super disk capable of haoding 1500 pictures - unbelieveable. The pictures can be imported to any program very easily and the quality of what you get with sizes up to 8x10 is surpurb.Motion an sound is also available with each picture you capture. E mailing to friends if easy and fun.Few major purchases I have ever made have been considered as money well spent. This one was.

Amazing storage options, both normal 1.44 floppy and 120MB super drive, makes this camera stand out of the rest. A 120MB super drive for storage stores approx 1,500 images, I cannot confirm this because  I just dont seem to be able to get one single super drive floppy filled.  Its data storag is enormous. Great for people who love taking lots of pics  on the fly and later deciding what to keep and what not to. The 10sec video  recording option is also pretty good. I fell that using the super drive I  should be allowed to take the videos for longer, but the 10secs restriction  applies here too. The only down side I have fealt so far is the 3X Optical  Zoom/2X Digital Zoom, which may be enough but is much lesser in comparision  with some of the other cameras in competition. All in all, a good buy for  money, wonderful for the more frequent users.", "Date": "June 11, 2000"}, {"Title": "Simple, Rechargeable, Massive storage, good pictures!", "Author": "Dr blue sky", "ReviewID": "R3FTIXP5ARA6NE", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This was my first digital camera.  However, I have bee using the Mavica that belongs to a friend for some time.  After seeing its debut, the Palmcam as Panasonic calls it...I knew I wanted one.  Once you connect it via its USB port, Windows sees it as another disk drive.  From there its easy to copy to the hard disk for speedy printing or processing with the included photodeluxe from Adobe - or you can leave the photos on the superdisk to do with as you please - 1500 photos at normal resolution, 800 at medium and 400 at high resolution is a lot of space - you don't have to carry ten floppies with you anymore!  Batteries?  One recargeable battery pack is all you need, it recharges in less than two hours - unless you plan to take photos nonstop for more than an hour - then get a spare if you can't use the direct DC adapter which gives you unlimited power.  It may be slow in terms of waiting for the photos to write to the disk, but that's what the burst mode is there for if you need it.  Mpeg movies are limited to ten seconds though, I would have liked to see more time available in this mode.  Otherwise I have had no complaints.", "Date": "January 4, 2001"}, {"Title": "I just LOOOOOOOOVE my new digital Camera!", "Author": null, "ReviewID": "R2ODKYFLWUWXKE", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Merry Christmas to Me!  I bought this camera for myself on December 17th, I've had it a little over 2 weeks and have taken almost 500 images already including .jpg's and .mpg's!  This is a dandy camera!  I am so pleased with it!  The storage capacity (120mB memory SuperDisk drive) is fantastic!  The rechargeable battery pack is very long lived: at least 200 images before it needed recharging.  Plus, I was so tickled to show off my new toy I additionally drained the battery to show off the images I had already taken to everyone within reach...including museum guards and the lady at the baggage x-ray machine at the airport!  Quality at the highest density is excellent!  But most of my photos were taken at the lowest resolution and are perfectly fine for e-mail.  Automatic flash is excellent, and can be supressed in manual mode for taking museum pictures.  Takes good low-light .jpg's.  The QuickTime Movie mode (limited to 10 secs) is an added bonus with this camera: what fun to send a moving, speaking Christmas greeting!", "Date": "January 4, 2001"}, {"Title": "Super Digital Camera with Super Features.", "Author": null, "ReviewID": "R16L7RZ7HLON26", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "The Simon Said review is a \"Real Bummer\"!

Our family loves being able to see such great pictures of the kids and the sights.  The only bummer is that when our computer arrived, the installation software was not able to use the computer as a super disk driver (we have Windows XP), so we have as yet to figure out some way to retrieve all the photos we took on the super disk.

This camera is used with both a PC and Macintoch G4 and I-MACs. It is a completely versitile piece of equipment as my G4 has a superdisc drive but currently this driver is not available, so the Palm Cam works wonders and is the easy way to use superdisc media on all my computers, and also allows me to utilize it for some great camera shots and short movie clips, hundreds of snapshots equally as clear when using zoom.

Edick", "ReviewID": "RM1UNKE8YLYAH", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Bought this camera used based on another review at this site.  If you like itsy-bitsy cameras, this one is not for you.  If you like a decent-sized camera (that can't get lost in your wallet!!!) this is for you.Not great for sports or high speed shots.  Great with posed pictures, pictures around the house, we use it at the botanical gardens a lot.  It usually comes with Super Disks- these are expensive and rather hard to find.  Then you have to use a converter to get them onto your computer (they don't work in a floppy drive).  Use a floppy instead, it's much easier to click and then put the floppy in the floppy drive, attach, and send.Even though the resolution is only 1.3, it has been useful when our big, fancy 35mm camera failed at the Grand Canyon.  You know instantly if the picture turned out or if grandma blinked.  The colors did not turn out as strong as a higher resolution camera...but then again, we didn't have to spend 10 minutes setting up for the shot.  The slide-button zoom is extremely easy to use.  We got several beautiful pictures of the largest crows we had ever seen -the size of cats- right down to the gleam on their feathers.I take a lot of pictures of our garden, the house, the dogs, the cats, my husband being goofy on the lawn mower, and I am always able to go right in and attach it to an email and send them to my mom within minutes.  A cheap old floppy is waaaay more accessable for us than the SuperDisks, and in normal mode, holds about 10 pictures.  I always walk around with a few floppies- at a buck each, I can afford to!  Super Fine mode holds about 5 pictures on a regular floppy.It is easy to hold and easy to use.  For what we spent on a used one, <$200.00, we couldn't be happier. We bought ours from someone who wanted at least 3 megapixels and decided to get rid of it.  We will definitely be trying the PV-SD5000 (3.3 megapixel model) as soon as the prices come down and we can get one that has been gently used, probably from someone who \"needed\" 6 megapixels (why?!?!?!) and wants to get rid of their camera.

I walked by the Panasonic PV-SD4090 while looking for my wife a computer chair for her office. I read all the information and was really impressed with the fact that it held so many photos. I decided to risk the purchace even though it was not an Olympus. I took side by side pictures both inside and out and was very impressed with the results. Not only is the image quality outstanding but the fact alone of the storage space and super fast downloads off the super disk even amazed me more. I do digital photography.

It also copies pics, holding them in memory until you insert your target disk! The Super Disk can hold hundreds of pics depending on the mode you select, I have yet to put a dent in the count. I have to photograph houses and this camera is a real worker - it has never let me down. The battery charges quickly, too. After a recent OS crash I installed XP and was bummed out to find that the included software does not support XP. But my disappointment was short-lived when I remembered the copy function. I just copied my pics from the Super Disk to a regular floppy, inserted in my PC and the XP viewer took it from there. It may even have been faster than downloading! This camera's a little bulky, well, really bulky, but the performance and ease of operation more than compensates! I guarantee you'll like it - even if you, like me, are not a \"techie\". Great price, too!UPDATE 8/24/2011: I am still using this camera! It does things my other cameras don't, like close-ups.
