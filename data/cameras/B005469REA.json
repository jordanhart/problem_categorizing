{"Reviews": [{"Title": "A wildly awesome security system!", "Author": "Revhook", "ReviewID": "RBIMDBLA894P7", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I love this system! I have installed Honeywell's Vista model and after installing the Lynx in my own home, I have decided that I will never install anything else but the Lynx. It is super easy to install and set up and is equally effective as even the most sophisticated systems out there. Not only does it do home security, it also does property perimiter protection, water sensors, and temperature sensor. You can also install a camera system to it and monitor it through Total Connect on your computer or cell phone.I installed the basic package which included 3 door/ window contacts, 1 motion sensor, 1 keyfob and the base unit, in about 1 hour. Next, I am going to add smoke detectors and CO detectors.", "Date": "August 20, 2011"}, {"Title": "Honeywell Ademco L5000", "Author": "Michael S.", "ReviewID": "R2HV8TT2FEWYPR", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "We use this system at our office. It's simple for all of our employees to set or disarm the alarm with their own unique codes. The touch screen interface makes it simple to use as opposed to traditional keypads which can be confusing. We highly recommend this product and seller.", "Date": "July 9, 2013"}, {"Title": "Top Quality at affordable price", "Author": "Dave", "ReviewID": "R1F28LTWP7OL8F", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "the price was excellent and Honeywell is by far the top of the line when it comes to security products. We had an old key pad that was not reliable, so we are very excited with this upgrade!", "Date": "June 29, 2013"}, {"Title": "Cannot beat the features for the price", "Author": "Anne", "ReviewID": "R2WEKUA850OLYT", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This unit performed better than I expected. I had replaced my old wireless alarm with this unit. I was worried about setting it and using it but it was very easy to do. The instructions that come with the system could not be any better than they are. As a home owner I was concerned that there would be all kind of issues with the system when I set it up. It has been working perfect for the past 2 weeks and that is better than the system I had professionally installed years ago by one of those companies that advertise on TV. If you are looking for a great value and an easy system to use this is the system for you. The other great thing about this system is the ability it has to be expanded which I plan on doing when I have construction done. The accessories and components that are available are top notch and great for any home owner. If you are looking to protect your loved ones and your possessions then this is all you will need with the many products available. I looked at many more expensive systems that offer the same as this. I am so glad that I have made the right choice and highly recommend this to anyone who needs a simple system and if you need more then this is the system for you. Honeywell proved to be the best.", "Date": "July 23, 2013"}, {"Title": "Wireless Alarm keypad", "Author": "mario", "ReviewID": "R3BVG4VXMQL9HU", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "The touch screen is fragile, it got broken with a finger big pression.
