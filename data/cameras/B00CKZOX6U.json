{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Great package deal", "Author": "lefty3", "ReviewID": "R1QT7JMJ9C00XQ", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I just received the package and haven't used the camera yet but I have to say that I'm already impressed.  First think out of the box was the large tripod. Frankly I bought the package for the flotation band, extra battery and memory card and thought the other stuff would be junk.  Much to my surprise the extras are actually very nice.The large tripod is sturdy without being too heavy (.9 lb), has three different sections of leg that can be easily extended at various lengths and the head swivels in multiple directions/angles.  Much better quality than I expected.  The mini-pod is also nice; the legs are metal and not plastic, so it not only adjusts easily but will stay where you put it.The camera case is nicely padded and comes with a shoulder strap but doesn't have any pockets for memory card or extra battery (they both may fit inside with the camera).  The memory card wallet holds three cards and includes a small card in each slot where you can write whats on the card.  The card reader takes 3 types (SD, XD, and CF) and comes with a 30\" cable.The camera is really nice.  The only thing that will take getting used to is there is no cover over the lens so it's really easy to put your fingers on it when fiddling with the battery, memory card or plugging it in to charge.  You also can't charge the battery separate from the phone.  I'm very happy that it came with a manual on CD; I like that better than having to search online or download a pdf.  Ihavent' had to use the manual yet or the camera...still charging the battery.  I didn't try to take pictures right out of the box; the quick start guide says to charge up to 4 hours before taking pictures.That's about all for now.  I'll post more once I've used the camera and let you know how it goes.  For now I'm very satisfied with what I purchased.ADDENDUM - Dec 4, 2013I'm just back from a trip to Australia and I have some updates:1. The case that came with the package is not easy to zip open/close and doesn't have room for extra battery or memory cards.  I stopped using it; it's not worth having IMHO.2. The camera DOES float with the foam strap.  I tested it multiple times while snorkeling in fairly calm water; dont' know how it would do in moving water if you're a kayaker or rafter.3. I like the various modes that can be set, and the underwater mode worked really well, videos and still shots  of the Great Barrier Reef turned out really well.4. I had some trouble with auto-focus when using the zoom function.  Sometimes when zoomed all the way into a subject the camera wouldn't focus.  If I zoomed out and then back it it would find the focus point, but sometimes the fish I wanted had already swam on.  Not sure if this is the camera or something I was doing wrong.5. I changed batteries once, memory cards multiple times, and charged the phone 2-3 times and never had problems with water intrusion thru those doors.All in all I'm very pleased with the purchase and would recommend.", "Date": "October 25, 2013"}, {"Title": "No receipt in the package", "Author": "Tere", "ReviewID": "R26STWC7FNTZK", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "My order never came with a receipt...

I take pictures in all kinds of weather and now I do not have to worry about rain damaging the camera.  Also it takes wonderful pictures, just a good as the old SLR camera I bought 10 years ago, and never used even a forth of the features.  It is simple to use and its quality is great, now if I could just quit shaking when I take a picture I'll have it made ;)", "Date": "January 30, 2014"}, {"Title": "Love It!!!", "Author": "Amber", "ReviewID": "RDAK4Y5644DG4", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Took this camera everywhere with me on a trip I took to the Caribbean.
