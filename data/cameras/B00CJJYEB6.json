I had no idea it has a feature that can spot a non-smiling face into a smile, it'll take a picture by itself. Really? Outrageous but hell, it takes great pictures! Don't ask me about the blink feature! I couldn't get over it and kept on playing with that one. Haha!I usually make videos so I tested with the front LCD feature and it DID appear that I got the frame into the black backdrop I had set up and then when I got it on my computer. Huh? It goes over the backdrop, almost widescreen-like which was not shown when I was using it. Ah, now I know.As for the premium kit can be a little too extra, for example, two batteries? I need only one but okay. The cleaning fluid did leak out a little when I opened the package but it did not ruin anything.Overall, I am a happy customer.", "Date": "January 14, 2014"}, {"Title": "Great little camera for the price", "Author": "R.

The zoom and video functions are outstanding.Be sure to check for what is contained in the specific package offered by each seller: some do not include things like the memory card, charger, case, etc.", "Date": "January 8, 2014"}, {"Title": "This was a hit", "Author": "Mom of 2 \"Sheryl\"", "ReviewID": "RK4IVJ33V67AM", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "THis camera is fantastic.  I bought it for the convenience of being able to take the picture and see yourself in the front screen.  Prevents A LOT of deleting because you can frame yourselves in easily.  Smaller than I expected/pocket-like.  Not positive about the pictures yet as it is new.  The wi fi is also fantastic.  No need to transfer to computer...just post or email ones you want.  Shipped VERY fast.  And big plus..insurance for two years was available for $14.  Can't beat that!!", "Date": "December 27, 2013"}, {"Title": "very good product", "Author": "Lenda", "ReviewID": "R1O2A7E854NB05", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "The camera is very good, and the size is perfect ...

What I don't like about it is the wifi connectivity. Why do I have to constantly reenter my wifi key each time I use a different service (uploading via youtube, facebook, picasa etc). Maybe it's just me but that's what i've noticed so far and it's driving me nuts. I'm returning this camera.", "Date": "June 19, 2013"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": null, "Features": null, "Name": "Samsung DV150F Dual-View Smart Digital Camera (white) Premium kit with a 16GB card, Lithium ion battery, Digpro case and a cleaning kit.", "ImgURL": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51MDfldePqL._SY300_.jpg", "ProductID": "B00CJJYEB6"}}
