After a bit of experimenting, it seems it doesn't, and is perfectly usable with Ubuntu (or indeed any OS) and Firefox.  No need for Windows at all.So, for anybody else who wants to use the BL-C1A camera with something other than Windows here's how.First, ignore the shiny Windows CDROM in the box.  Plug the camera into your router with your own network cable (they don't supply one!) and plug in the power supply.  Wait a minute.  If your router is 192.168.0.1, the camera should default to 192.168.0.253 (or 192.168.1.253 for a 192.168.1.1 router, etc).From Firefox on the local network just go to the IP addess of the camera (as above) followed by ?mode=local and you should get the camera's built in web server. (The mode=local is essential, to activate it). Create an admin userid/password, hit enter.  That's it.Configuring the cameras for static addresses, different ports etc is all done via the web interface after that point, so still doesn't need Windows or IE in any way.With a few lines written in the manual they could drop the Windows/IE requirement.Camera works very nicely, and so does emailing, and the viewnetcam dynamic dns service (after a bit of a battle with router settings).  One warning: you can't test the viewnetcam service from the same network that the camera is on, so before you think it's not working try it from elsewhere!Camera does the job fine for the price, one point deducted for not having any non-Windows installation instructions.", "Date": "April 13, 2007"}, {"Title": "Impressive for the price", "Author": "M. Flocco", "ReviewID": "R37NTW0JVZYM8R", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I was impressed with the quality of this camera for the price.  I am currently using it as a remote baby monitor.  It was cheaper than the video monitors they sell for babies, and it's more versatile once I\"m done using it for that purpose.  The best part of it is the back end functionality, but overall it's a nice camera.  Some points:1. Triggers - you can set the camera up to send photos via email or FTP whenever motion is sensed, or at a regular interval.  I'm saving photos on my web server whenever the baby moves (with 10 minutes between each snapshot), and then I have a job that creates a time-lapse movie at the end of each day.  Useful?  Not really, but pretty cool regardless.2. Web Server - The web server is solid, includes authentication, and is easy to configure for inexperienced users.3. Image quality - The image quality during the day is surprisingly good - but remember, this isn't a large lens camera, it's a webcam.  Don't expect your 640x480 images to look like they were taken with your digital camera.  Instead, think camera phone but slightly better.  Certainly good enough.  Motion video is impressive.  I don't know how it looks from a bandwidth perspective, but I'm guessing the wireless version of this camera would be comparable.  \"Color Night Vision\" is a joke, though.  It does adjust surprisingly well in low-light conditions, but overall you need light.  If you have a very dim room, the image is literally black.Again, overall I'm impressed with the camera and feel it's a good value.", "Date": "February 5, 2007"}, {"Title": "Great for Home Security", "Author": "Robert C.

The BL-C10A is double the price of the BL-C1A thou.  But after setting up all 3 cameras I was surprised to find out the BL-C1A's have sensitivity settings for the motion detection feature, and they work Great!  The BL-C10A is missing the ability to adjust the motion sensitivity.  Another difference I noticed was the BL-C1A handles low light better, althought it says both handle low light the same the images on the BL-C1A seem brighter in low light.Setting the cameras up to see each other was easy and now i can remote in and see all 3 camera's at the same time.  I have sensors setup on all 3 and they work great.  Now when I am at work I can alway check on my house and my family.  I have images emailed to me everytime the motion sensors go off.  I have also tested the image to cell phone feature and it does work fine but even with a good phone its sometime hard to see the images on a phone.  Email works best in my opinion, and sense most phones can check email you can still get to the image they are just not scaled down to a phone size.I highly recommend this camera especialy if you want to use it for motion sensing.  If you must have pan/tilt the BL-C10A is also great but you lose some control on the motion sensor sensitivity.", "Date": "April 5, 2007"}, {"Title": "Good  Camera ..bad manual", "Author": "Kennedy De Silva", "ReviewID": "RVU2ZGPURJNDU", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "Bought this camera and got it installed in no time.

I finally had to call into Panasonic support and they were great. Took about 15 minutes for them to walk me through a new setup. I had already spent 2 nights trying to configure the firewall on my own but they pointed out I had to change the setup in the camera as well.To make this work you need to go to setup tabchoose static connection modechange port number to 5000for mine IP Address 192.168.1.253subnet mask 255.255.255.0default gateway 192.168.1.254DNS server 1 192.168.1.254DNS server 2 4.2.2.1You will then need to go to the firewall of your router and setup an egress rule for the device using port 5000.  This worked for me and I can now access the camera from anywhere.I further setup up limited user access. For this you need to go to \"administer\" and choose \"Do not permit access from guest users\"Then you go to \"general user\" tab and create the user account that you want to allow to access the camera. I set mine up to only allow \"guests\" to access the camera M-F 8a-6p. That was pretty easy to figure out as well.Finally, if you want to buffer the images you can set that up on the \"trigger\" tab. I chose to just have it store the images in the camera at 1 per minute and get just over 4 hours that I can replay.  I am playing with trying to get it to email tonight.If you have AT&T; then I hope these settings work for you. If not (or if you have any other problems) I highly advise you call Panasonic support before you give up.

Bush", "ReviewID": "R2R39EVV9135PN", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "We use these in our retail store. We need motion detection for nighttime and snapshots during the open hours, the ability to push the images offsite quickly, and the ability to snag live snapshots from our web server via our blackberry phones, and connect directly via the internet.This camera does it all at a really good price, especially if you look at other commercial solutions. Not a single problem with the stability of the camera, after 2+ years!!! The power supplies last about 2 years it seems, I have 3 cameras and I've replaced 2 supplies in the past month (no big deal, they are $15 at Fryes.)They are small and not noticed by customers, since our walls are white. I have noticed other businesses are using them also (the local hooters!).I used the provided software on an XP machine to give them an initial IP address and password, from there on, it's all via their web interface. Getting live snapshots is simply a matter of finding the right URL to use, and with some digging on Panasonic's site, you'll find a CGI/Developer manual that spells it all out, technically, but very thorough. The FTP (outbound from camera) setup seemed a bit tough at first but a bit of playing and I got it working.Can't fault the camera or Panasonic. This is a really good value, and if youre a bit technical, you may really find this camera lets you do a lot of complex stuff like notification and web site integration for cheap!Panasonic dropped their web service I think. I dont use it anyhow. And the IE requirement is only for the ActiveX control, which allows a pseudo zoom/pan feature anyhow. Other browsers work fine.Get em before Panasonic decides to drop them for the next 'improved' model!

Hooking into the free web service to allow us to view from any internet connection wasn't as easy. Taking the Microft-ian approach, if the hardware plays well with your software, things work smoothly and you're ready to go. If it DOESN'T, you're on your own.I admit I did NOT call for tech support, choosing to try things out myself first.First, I'm not great at networking or the terminology used. The manual tells you to set up your router for IP Forwarding on the port you use. Not familiar with what exactly IP Forwarding means, I simply opened the port on my router for this device, and that seems to have done it.Since the automatic account creation for the free account failed as well, it was only by accident that I discovered that this could be accessed via the 'Dynamic DNS' option on the Setup tab (hope this saves someone some time).So, after all was done, I'm now able to keep an eye on the cats (and watch them dance across the table they're not supposed to be on), and with a clearance Powerline ethernet system, can set up the camera anywhere I can find a pair of power outlets.And, perhaps the greatest indicator of my satisfaction: a second camera is on the way to me.", "Date": "May 27, 2008"}, {"Title": "Good, small package with some limitations", "Author": "Strohmian", "ReviewID": "R3EABH0ZHVUKZM", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I recently had something damaged ($$$$) in my apartment and both cleaning lady and Super denied involvement, so I figured that at least going forward I should be smart about my stuff. I was looking for a \"small\" surveillance solution (\"small\" in size, effort, running cost, intrusion, and wallet), and so far, the Panasonic seems to fit my bill. Details:HARDWARE:This device has a somewhat odd shape which, together with the bright white enclosure makes it stand out a little too much for my taste, especially if you planned to discretely put it on a bookshelf. Inside the (easily openable) enclosure, you'll find a single square motherboard where the actual camera is soldered onto. Bummer for those DIY-ers who perhaps hoped to separate the cam from the board in order to conceal it in a stuffed animal or something. The camera has a power led which to my surprise is software- controllable: it can be on, off, or on while recording.The camera sensor itself is very tiny. From the picture it looks like you'll get 1/2\" worth of camera, but most of it is ornaments (like space to prominently print \"digital zoom network camera\") and the CCD is no bigger than in a cheap cellphone. With that small a sensor, I would have hoped that Panasonic forewent the color filter and make the camera black&white;, which would have increased sharpness and light sensitivity, but clearly engineering folded to the marketing department here. Also, the field of view seems quite narrow to me - surveillance should be as wide- angled as possible, even at the expense of detail. Finally, the resolution of the sensor is low (640x480), yet the digital noise is high. I'm subtracting 1 star for not putting in a better or more specialized camera.SOFTWARE:This product comes with some PC software, but frankly I haven't touched it after reading a the other reviews here. You can set up the camera entirely with a web browser once you figured out the address. As for making the surveillance available on the net, it is no different than exposing a web server using dyndns.org.The in-camera software is better than I expected. I addition to some camera preferences like brightness, etc. you can set days/hours ofoperation, and register other cameras so you can view them all on one screen. On the actual life view screen you can specify the refresh interval or \"motion\" to save on bandwith when you're monitoring remotely. In addition to live viewing, the unit can also buffer or transfer pictures. This works as follows: you have five \"triggers\", which can be configured independantly. For each trigger, you can specify hours of operation, how it's triggered (interval or motion), how many pictures to process, how long to wait to retrigger and whether to save them to internal memory, or transfer them via email or ftp. I find this concept very versatile yet understandable. The internal buffer is very small though, holds barely 90 pictures in lowres(!).On the minus side regarding the software, the translation is sometimes challenging, especially in important sections. For example, there are two sliders on the motion detection tab, the explanation reading: \"Threshold: Adjust the threshold. If the threshold is set low, this software sensitively detects changes. Sensitivity: If you set sensitivity high, amplitude of motion detection bar gets jumpy.\". I assume these sliders are meant to configure the camera so it doesn't take your small pet for an intruder, but good luck figuring those out! Also, you cannot define any dead zones for motion detection. However, the firmware is upgradeable, so perhaps these things will improve. *2010 Update* Alas, no. The firmware has been updated, but the horrible wording remains throughout. This must be some sort of hobby project at Panasonic...This would be a 5-star device if it wasn't for the weak and narrow- angled camera. The only two ways to go up from here though are to either shell out four times as many dollares for an Axis megapixel camera or buy a good webcam for the same price as this panasonic and then use surveillance software on an always-on PC.", "Date": "August 31, 2008"}, {"Title": "No need for Windows - works fine with Mac OS X", "Author": "btp", "ReviewID": "R3MXYSOUVGZULK", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I have a Mac network, with an Airport, so I was a little worried about setting up the camera.

Robert said it would default to xxx.xxx.xxx.253.  Mine was issued 192.168.0.91.  So in my case, the URL for setup was as follows:[...]Just type that into your browser and you are up and running.  But the trick is finding the correct IP address.  On a different network, the camera will probably get a different IP address.  With the Airport, you can go to the setup and get the list of connected devices  -- I think most routers have a similar feature. Worst case, it would just take a few minutes to run through every possibility, 2-255.

Let's talk about what it doesn't do:1) This is a wired camera only (obvious from the description)2) There is no ability to remotely swivel the lens (which is obvious from the pictures)3) It does not do sound4) Some software options are missing, the one that I find frustrating is the time-stamp on photos which lets you immediately see when they were taken5) The motion sensing is significantly less sensitive and you have to fiddle with settings to get it to work.It makes up for it in that the mounting bracket is nicely designed and was easily screwed into the top of window frame with two supplied screws.  It also looks decent, and not too \"techy\".But for the money, all things considered, it's a great choice.Here's my tip if you buy this:  Don't use the software supplied with it.

It will prompt you to create an ID & PasswordAfter that, access it by typing:  [...]It does include the [...] DDNS service and uPnP (Free for Panasonic customers), which makes setting up your router a breeze and sets up the correct URL for you to access the router from outside your firewall.I wish this camera had more features, but for the price, I'm willing to live with the compromise over the more expensive Panasonic camera.", "Date": "June 26, 2010"}, {"Title": "Would not work without Cgi command string", "Author": "Joseph T.

The low-light performance is above average in this price range. If a prospective owner uses this camera in a moderately lit environment, e.g. an exterior view at night with streetlights, motion will likely be detected, but details in the captured images won't be recognizable which is understandable. Until manufacturers move to more suitable codecs, e.g. Google's VP8, and away from MJPEG *, image quality will continue to be lacking in moderately priced cameras as well. Since the camera's body is relatively flat, placement is pretty flexible, e.g. in a window sill. Since the private IP address range of 10.0.0.0/8 is normally limited to large LANs, not individuals with small LANs, I'm using the range of 192.168.0.0/24. Personally, I'm using the BL-C1A with ZoneMinder on Slackware64 Linux and it's a good combination. I won't own a camera with built-in IR LEDs like FosCam because I mainly operate them through glass and frequently the firmware is buggy as well. Although, I haven't tested the BL-C1A yet for IR sensitivity, it's potentially a good candidate for a separate IR illuminator sitting in an adjacent window. The BL-C1A's LED will flash orange if the camera is \"improperly\" configured.  Overall, this camera is a decent purchase at $70 and a very good buy at $60. Personally, I can't recommend most cameras in this price range, but Panasonic's BL-C1A is an exception.* Recent research conducted by the UCSD around 2007 on using temporal redundancies in MJPEG images demonstrates the potential for noticeable improvement in MJPEG video. However, has this newer research found it's way into the firmware of mass-produced devices yet?

C. YAN", "ReviewID": "R3ECSBC9HWOUAP", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "I purchased this as a baby monitor/nanny cam.  The video quality is not bad, but the installation on my Mac required me to run it via a PC emulator (I tried both Parallels and VMware Fusion).  The manual did not provide adequate instructions for me to get it to work, but Panasonic's phone support line was very helpful in providing assistance.The main issue I have with this device was that in order to use it, I had to downgrade the network security on my home system to WEP since the Panasonic system is not compatible with WPA.  I was uncomfortable with this and ended up ditching this in favor of the Mobicam.  Then, realized that the Mobicam install wasn't easy on a Mac and the video quality was very poor.In the end, I ended up spending a little more for a system that was much easier and more robust - the Wilife (Logitech) system.  This system uses a hidden camera within a clock, took 15 minutes to set up (using either Mac with PC emulation or the inexpensive PC I got for this purpose), is easy to expand up to 6 cameras, and didn't require me to compromise security on my network.  It also records and shows me when activity occurred within the camera's field of view.  It just doesn't have sound, but the video quality and ease of use were excellent for this system.", "Date": "March 1, 2009"}, {"Title": "It's Working!!!!", "Author": "renuwal", "ReviewID": "RMTCH72WXWWF7", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "The camera does what I want it to.

I wanted to set the camera up, have it buffer the images locally, and I would then plug it back into my router at the end of the day and review the images.  1.  The camera requires a network connection to boot up/initialize.  Since it's not wireless, that means a wired connection to a router must be present at all times in order for the camera to operate.  2.  The onboard cache of the camera is tiny, so storing images locally is not a viable option anyway.So, again, the camera works as advertised and perhaps I simply purchased the wrong tool for the job.  However, when they wrote that no local computer was necessary, I mistakenly assumed that (also) meant no constantly connected network.
