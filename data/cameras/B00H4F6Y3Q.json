{"Reviews": [{"Title": "A Truly 'Super' Zoom!", "Author": "Kort \"Art, Music, Book & Movie Enthusiast\"", "ReviewID": "RPB300RX6VAT0", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Allow me to preface this with the disclaimer that I don't own this camera, but had the opportunity to use one for 24 hours under a variety of conditions and really enjoyed it. I've owned Canon P&S; digicams before, but never one with an 30x zoom range. The 24mm wide angle low end is great for taking close-up shots and fitting everything in. Distortion is minimal. At 30x images are not quite as sharp, but they look great overall across the zoom range. The quality Canon glass and sensor combo delivers impressive photos with minimal issues. The main area I found this camera lacking was when I took low-light photos in natural light. The flash works fine, but otherwise the photos can get a bit grainy/pixelated/soft, focusing is a bit hit or miss, and camera response gets a bit slow. Indoors during the day should be okay, but if the lighting is low, issues may arise.Otherwise, I found the SX500 quite responsive. Image Stabilization (IS) at full zoom in daylight is good and the 16MP sensor captures more than enough detail. This camera would definitely benefit from a larger sensor though. And the 720 HD video is great (I especially like the dedicated video button), but I would really like full HD from a camera in this class. For the price though I really can't complain. The rear LCD is bright and clear in most lighting conditions, there are tons of controls and options, IS is effective, and battery life is good. Best of all it is fun to use. It feels good in the hand like a proper enthusiast camera should.If you don't mind the slightly larger form factor over a standard point-and-shoot, want a lot of zoom range, and don't want deal with a large SLR and its lenses, then the Canon PowerShot SX500 IS is a great option. It is among the best super zooms in my opinion. I own and love the B006T7QRN2, but if funds allowed, I wouldn't mind adding the Canon SX500 IS to my camera stable! It isn't perfect, but it is a great comprise of features and size for the price. This package with the 8GB SDHC card and camera bag just adds to the value. You'll probably want to eventually get a larger SDHC card though if you want to shoot a lot of video.~ Kort", "Date": "December 16, 2013"}, {"Title": "Great camera bad SD card.", "Author": "Keri Powell", "ReviewID": "R38Y9RURQRDSWT", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Camera is great, zoom is amazing but memory card would not format.
