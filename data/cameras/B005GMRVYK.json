{"Reviews": [{"Title": "happy with my Fuji F600EXR", "Author": "D-Squared", "ReviewID": "R2FCBEGFPJV1KR", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Great travel zoom camera with excellent image quality for a point and shoot; Response time is very fast, especially focus, and image quality is impressive. Keep in mind that this is a point and shoot camera, not a dSLR. (I do shoot with a Nikon dSLR and love it but want a pocket camera for travel.) I got this to replace my Panasonic Lumix DMC-ZS7 which I am giving to a family member as a gift. I was very happy with that model but had read about image quality not being as good in the Panasonic Lumix DMC-ZS10, (Panasonic's next model), so I started looking around at other brands. The size and feel of the F600EXR is very nice. I just really love holding it and using it. If you have pets, one thing you may love is the pet face detection modes - there is one for cats and one for dogs. Some people call this the \"cat mode\" or \"dog mode.\" What it does is a face detection for your pets, just like regular face detection focus zeroes in on people. This mode is awesome! It is spot on. It has tons of other modes, too - fireworks, landscape, portrait, enhanced portrait, pro focus, and more, as well. So, great for all uses and for vacation and travel. I especially wanted a nice zoom for the best all around travel pocket camera. Of course, the big thing about the Fuji F600EXR (and previous models) is the EXR technology, which uses the pixels in the camera in different ways to get the best image depending on your shooting situation. I'm very impressed with it. I haven't had the camera long (a few weeks) so I will update more as I use it but so far I am very happy with my purchase, especially the image quality for a pocket camera and the ability to set it on auto and get great pictures. (Good for when you don't have time to adjust settings or for giving it to a family member to use and enjoy, or just enjoying your vacation more than concentrating on the camera equipment.) I do recommend trying all of the modes and settings, though, to see what gives you the best results in different instances. I haven't tried the video yet but I will play around with that more soon.To sum up:response time - very fastimage quality - greatface detection for pets - fabulous! :)macro - beautiful detailssize and weight - feels solid but not too heavy and still small and portablecolors - accurateEXR - great job in high contrast situationsFocus is fast and accuratezoom - very nice results at full zoom but do remember to keep camera as still as you can or rest on something (due to gravity, the further out you zoom, the more likely you could see movement from the end of the lens if you aren't keeping the camera and lens very still.)I've posted some photos on full auto EXR mode from my first day wtih it. Will add more from the various shooting modes as I go. Feel free to ask a question and I'll do my best to answer.UPDATE - 1/9/2012Now that I've had time to use it more I thought I'd post a short update.1. I'm still happy with the camera, however, if you are a big low-light or night time shooter, I would recommend another camera over this one (Panasonic Lumix DMC-LX5 10.1 MP Digital Camera with 3.8x Optical Image Stabilized Zoom and 3.0-Inch LCD - Black). That being said, I do get consistently good results from this camera in all but night scenes. I even get great results indoors with and without flash (see the photo of my white cat in the example images), just not always great with night scenes or something with super low light (Christmas lights, etc.) I do sometimes but not as much as in the other shooting conditions.I set the image size to M to give the EXR technology a chance to work at its best. (As I understand it, the pixels combine/merge/join so you get 8 megapixesl with larger pixels and better quality - more or less). I've also had good results using the pro mode for night shots, just not as consistently good as with some other cameras.2. I am not a big movie mode users, but if it's in the camera, it's nice to have it work well. That being said, I can sometimes get good results with this one on movie mode but not always. I set the focus mode to be center focus and not continuous to keep it from hunting as much, but other cameras excel with the movie mode in my opinion. (no focus hunting).Overall, I still am pleased with this for a travel zoom camera if you are mostly out doing the tourist sight seeing activities - especially during the day (zoo, gardens, landmarks, etc.) I am updating my review from 5 stars to 4 because of the two items above that are not best in class in my opinion, but overall, I am still pleased with it.", "Date": "October 28, 2011"}, {"Title": "Small Changes Add Up To A Big Difference", "Author": "J. A. Coyle", "ReviewID": "RR0VLUHSRXO9R", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I first became familiar with the EXR line when I purchased the F200 and, because of that experience, I subsequently purchased the F500. Although I liked the 500, I had one major complaint. When the camera was turned on, the built in flash would automatically pop up. If you did not want flash, you had to push the flash back down manually. Of course, if you then wanted flash, you had to turn the camera off and on again. With the F600, that has changed. Now there is a button on the side of the body to control the flash. If you want it, hit the button. If you don't, leave it alone. Your call. There are any number of improvements to this model but, this small change alone sold me! It's what I've come to expect from FUJI. My personal opinion is, the EXR technology (even in auto mode) puts this line of cameras way above the rest of the class.", "Date": "November 16, 2011"}, {"Title": "Superior Image Quality", "Author": "James J.

The GPS \"landmark\" feature functions flawlessly, and can help track your photo shoot for later reference. I will revisit this review if anything changes, but at this point, I highly recommend this pocket camera.FOLLOW UP:  If one chooses to leave the GPS turned on, the camera will continue to receive the GPS signal even if the camera is turned off...........in this case the battery will drain very quickly........I recommend purchasing an extra battery.  Also, when I use the 360 Panorama function, the photo turns out very thin, for lack of a better term.  The manual does state that not all Panorama 360 photos will be full size.  They should tell everyone this in their ads.

Conner \"qm2-703\"", "ReviewID": "R3O5HGWGGY8Z9H", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "I am not going to be as harsh as reviewer \"EZ\",  but as a current owner of a beloved F30,  I too am feeling depressed by the F600.  it is a beautiful design, feels good, can return some excellent pictures, but is seriously flawed as both a still camera and a make-do videocam...The first one I got had a lens extension tube out of line, and made grinding noises until it quickly just quit, after about 4 uses.  I was not surprised, because the tube in my second one (Thanks to good work by 17th St Photo thru Amazon) actually wobbled in place when extended to full lengtth.  however, I was so wanting another good Fuji F-series cam, that I eagerly began tests.CONS :  The pictures can be very good, but are inconsistent in focus and color enough to be worrisome.  Video focus indoors is very bad, even in decent light ( 10am on a bright but overcast day).  I didn't try EXR mode too much, but when I did, I couldn't see very much obvious improvement.  I never felt certain that that lens tube would not snap any given moment. I really believe that all these \"Lens Error\" reviews on almost every mfr's long-zoom compacts are related to trying to put big zoom extension tubes on very much too-thin bodies.Other than that, I would be nit-picking, but those things were so major on a  $289 camera nowadays, it was too much for me.Not as good as the F600 at the 600's best, but much  better built and just very good overall as a long-zoom compact, I suggest the Canon Sx230..... using its Auto mode is usually good, but if you learn from its Auto and apply what you then know to the Program mode, you can get really good photos.  And the video is quite usable indoors, very good outdoors ( the zoom with digital out to 72X is a lot of fun !!!!!!)And the Sx230 at $199 is a Bargain with a capital B !!", "Date": "December 27, 2011"}, {"Title": "Major disappointment.", "Author": "Marcia E. Flynn", "ReviewID": "R1102LBUMFZBRS", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "Buyer BEWARE. Do not buy a camera (or anything else) through Amazon if their vendor is Atlanta Network Technologies (ANTOnline).  Good luck working with that company.  Make sure you read their Terms and Conditions BEFORE you buy.I returned my disappointing FUJI F600EXR and I received only 80% of my money back. Both ANTOnline and Amazon have denied a full refund and consider the case closed.What follows has been submitted previously: I spent considerable time researching a new camera. My Fuji E550 took great pictures so I remained brand loyal and settled on the new F600EXR. It has great sounding features so I was excited to get the camera and try it out.  After shooting many pictures in different settings and different modes, I never got a picture as crisp and with as good colors as my E550 (in auto mode/point and click.) The pictures were \"out of focus\" and grainy.  I searched some more and found a blog that recommended \"special settings\" for everday pictures . Why would the fancy automatic scene detections aperture setting, shutter speed not take good pictures.  What a waste.  This is a camera with 15x optical zoom, 16M pixels, etc and fails to take good pictures.  I could go on. What amazes me is that there are 5 star reviews which inticates that people got this camera and had great success.  Are there \"lemons\" within the same model?  I can see that the lenses could vary, but the software in the chipset should be consistent and \"nailed\".I am now an ex-Fuji fan. I sent the camera back. Starting my search over again. Very disappointed. By the way, the reason for replacing my old E550 is that I dropped it and the LCD broke. It has a view finder so I still can take pictures, but I can change any setting since the screen display is gone.", "Date": "December 8, 2011"}, {"Title": "Nice travel camera", "Author": "C. Wayne Cornell", "ReviewID": "R23F6AJVX6QZF4", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "In 2007 we  went on a European tour and I took a Nikon D100 DSLR and a couple of lenses. Got decent images but hated hauling the gear around--especially through airport security. In 2008 we went to China. I had upgraded to the Nikon D300. I got great pictures but it was even heavier than the D100 and taking it up the side of the mountain at the Great Wall wasn't a lot of fun.In 2011 we signed up for a European River Cruise from Budapest to Amsterdam. Despite my love for my Nikons a started thinking about I might be able to enjoy the trip more and still get my pictures. At a local photography store I encountered the just-released Fuji  F600EXR. The first thing that struck me eas the it had an instant shutter release. Most point and shoots have a shutter lag so the subject has often moved before you can shoot. The 600EXR can even shoot in multiple bursts--although I have never used that feature. It also has GPS that can record exactly where a picture was shot for later reference. Finally, like ass Fuji cameras, it produces great color. I took the camera on the cruise--the only camera I took, and enjoyed to trip more than any of the previous ones. The camera fit in my pocket (actually I got a little case for it about the size of two packs of cigarettes). I took two batteries just to be on the safe side. During the two week trip I shot several thousand photos and came to the following conclusions:The outdoor photos can be enlarged nearly as much as thouse from my DSLRs and the color is outstanding. Not being anchored to a big, heavy DSLR and lenses made the trip and the flight to and from much more enjoyable..Other things I learned:  The GPS eats up a lot of power. On the next trip I'm taking four rechargable batteries. The wide angle end of the lens--conparable to 24mm on a 35mm camera is a very useful tool when you are traveling--especially in areas with narrow streets and cramped buildings. The telephoto lens is more powerful than what I used on my DSLRs BUT it is very difficult to hold it steady  when shooting inside at slow shutter speeds. Better used outside.  Like most point and shoots in can be difficult to compose your picture on the screen on a bright sunny day. But that's a problem with almost all compact digitals. I would love the Fuji even more it it also had an optical viewfinder like some of the Canons have.I have shot a lot of photos for a living over the years and I would feel comfortable shooting photos for publication with the F600EXR--as long as I was shooting outside. Another great feature for people looking for the best quality images in the camera's RAW image mode which give you a lot more capability in post processing.", "Date": "April 15, 2013"}, {"Title": "Compact!", "Author": "Raquel", "ReviewID": "R2JXYSQ9F19HX5", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Compact and complete!

I was very impressed with Fuji F600EXR reviews and decided to get this camera to complement my Nikon DSLR for short travels, it looked very attractive. However, having received the camera and shot a few pictures, I got increasingly disappointed. The shots are very inconsistent, even two shots taken sequentially under the same conditions looked differently. When zoomed in, the pictures come out underexposed and if zoomed out under the same setup look much better. The auto focus in the movie mode isn't working properly, it is constantly hunting and the clips look blurry. What is really frustrating, is that when the picture come out right, it isn't actually good, it is beautiful, it almost has DSLR quality, but I couldn't find a way to get them consistently...

As a consequence, you're stuck with what JPG can do. Noise tends to increase naturally in poor lighting conditions, which is the case when there's debris in suspension or you're going deeper than three feet: I didn't want to add JPG compression artifacts on top of that. I like to blow up my pictures and see the detail.I bought an F600EXR as a discontinued item after reading the good reviews. In combination with its housing it was less expensive than some new waterproof cameras. There are newer iterations of this product that have even more features and better zoom, but I wasn't looking for the latest and greatest, just good, clean pictures in a small form factor. I also checked to see whether the Fuji RAW format was supported natively by later versions of Photoshop. It is. Had it not been, Adobe offers a converter, the DNG engine, which works reasonably well.So here I was, quite happy with my purchase, until I actually took pictures with it in the modes it offers: manual, P, EXR (auto focus) and the like. There was noticeable noise in every single picture. This must be because of the sensor: lots of megapixels on a tiny sensor - not a good combo.I'm not outraged: if it seems too good to be true ... You know the rest. I would have gladly paid a hundred dollars more for a larger sensor, though. What's the point of shooting in RAW if you can't get a clean picture?I'm not blaming the camera: it's a very solid contender in its class. You can't beat the price and feature combination, and the form factor is very pleasant.

This is the start of a great camera.2nd: it is fully manual.  I love this feature along with aperture priority.  This way I can create the shots I want utilizing depth of field.  However, the shutter priority does not work quite as well, I have yet to figure out why.  Anyway, It is great to get those low light shots or still shots or what ever shots that a fully automatic camera cannot get.3rd: low light is great with a 3200 ISO.4th:16 mp. I know there is a backlash to the idea of larger size is better, however it is great to be able to choose the size of file you need; as well as, having the ability to crop way in on a large file.On the down side, Another reason I bought this particular camera is its RAW functionality.  It does shoot something called a RAF file, which is Fuji's RAW format.  What I have discovered is that if indeed these RAFs are the raw file, then the cameras optics must be pretty bad.  Let me explain.  I have many year experience with Raw, it is the only thing I shoot professionally.  I love the non-destructive adjusting ability.  The Raw files out of this camera just plain look crappy.  You have the ability to shoot Raw plus a JPG.  Comparing the two, the JPG looks great and the Raw is distorted and the color is off.  What must be happening is that FUJI had figured out what is wrong with the optics and has a processer in the camera to compensate for it.  So fine, now I shoot just the jpg and RAW only if I want the end product to be Black and White.  It is not that big a deal, again, if this was a more expensive camera ($500 to$1000 or up) then I would expect perfection.

We got our first use out of it on a trip to the Grand Canyon, and we were amazed!Our favorite things about the pics from that trip:- It was a hazy day at first, and those pictures still show great color and definition- When it got sunny and bright, the exr settings managed the complex light well and the pics are still beautiful- The clarity on the zoom is incredible. We took pictures from the South Rim of a rest area at the base of the canyon and could make out features on peoples' faces (this is about 2000 feet down if I remember correctly)!- It was so easy to use, I was actually able to walk my typically technologically challenged wife through using most of the features in about 5 minutes- The ability to shoot in panorama, black and white, and sepia along with all the other great preset features was awesomeThe second major use was at my wife's indoor graduation party:- Everything above plus this camera somehow manages to use very minimal flash so even in the fairly dark room no one looked washed out and all the pictures look great!I will say this to the camera snobs: I don't know if this camera is for you because I am not a camera snob. However, if you are an average Joe looking for a versatile, affordable camera that easily takes pictures that will make your friends go \"Wow, what a great picture!\" This camera is for you.**********UPDATE*************So, everything I wrote above is still true.... As long as the camera is working. A couple months after this review, my wife and I took the camera on vacation with us to Michigan. on the second day, the zoom started working only intermittently. The, it stopped working at all. By the 4th day, the camera was randomly trying to switch itself between modes and would not take pictures. We had to return it (and for some reason Amazon charged me a restocking fee for my broken camera, WTF?). I replaced the camera (my wife's anniversary gift) with the 660EXR. Here's hoping Fuji did a better job of quality design on this one.

It was supposed to get here in 5 - 8 days, it got here in 4 days, giving me more time to use it before my vacation. It has quite a few perks in it and I love the 15x zoom, it gives you way better photos, and you can easily see who/what is the subject of the photo. Another great thing is the grip on the side of the camera, it kind of makes you feel more secure holding the camera. The video is a pretty high quality video, the only downside is if you take your picture during the video, about 2 - 3 seconds are cut out during that time period. It had an amazing selection of option and 9/10 photos are great, the other one has a slight blur. Also, unlike other cameras that I have viewed on, this one's flash is not in a bad spot. It is in a small way where your finger would be, except it gives you room to put your finger when the flash is up, good job Fuji. The dial is a bit hard to turn, but I guess that's for the good, so that the camera doesn't suddenly switch mode, oh, and the flash button on the left side of the camera is a bit hard to push as well, but after you use it a couple of times, its much better. It's overall amazing. I have been able to check out pretty much every single mode, and they all are incredibly amazing. If I could rate this camera more, I'd give it a 100 or so! It also takes AMAZING flower photos. I could see like each individual petal on a clover, and on certain flowers, you could see the inside really clear, far better than the human eye can see.

It does trees and parked cars ok but a flying bird or moving subjects outdoors are often blurry or out of focus. The camera is in the auto mode. The zoom is very good and battery life is pretty long. The software loads without trouble but I can't make sense of the FUJI filing system, too much attention on scrolling eye candy and half open icon folders for me.There is a lot of lens movement (retraction) when you review photos. Lens moves in and out after just a short period of time. I am using a 32 gig SD card which I haven't even come close to filling up. Guess it's too soon to really evaluate this camera but I haven't found any feature to format the card (erase all files) while in the camera.

Convenience, Resolution, Shutter Feel, Control, Size, Price andResults. And I might add a die-hard lover of film.  The F600EXR with extra batteries, travel battery charger, hard case toprotect it and some of the fastest memory you can afford soon becomeseasily doable. It doesn't do anything very well but it manages to do mostthings reasonably well, enough to make it useable.  The lens, while not being the sharpest in the compact zone, will stillgive reasonable resolution and contrast if some care is taken. Bracingagainst something or using a tripod/timer sorts the shakes out and you'llend up with pretty sharp images. You can let the electronics do the workor you take control, pity though that Advanced Anti Blur only works in EXR Auto.  The shutter feel is quite fast, one of the fastest around. No shutterdelay to miss the moment. For me the shutter release time and feel wascritical. Not all other compacts are as quick and responsive to your needsas this little unit.  The Mode dial is easily moved off it's intended settings if your notcareful, something to watch for I've found. And getting to know in themenu where something is to tweak is an under statement of sorts.  The lens in movie mode/zooming is noisy and auto focus/movie has a noiseof it's own also. Wanting Pictures not movies as luck would have it.  The results coming out of this camera are very serviceable and forsomething so feature packed, cheap to. There is no reason to come backempty handed with this camera.  Now if Fuji built one the same size with 20+ mega pixels,10xmanual/auto quieter sharper zoom lens, 25 ISO setting ?, faster quadprocessor, longer battery life, I'd be tickled pink.", "Date": "January 10, 2012"}, {"Title": "Very unhappy", "Author": "Carole", "ReviewID": "R2M3G1R7EDGB21", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "My husband purchased this camera for me to replace a much loved and used Canon.

This is one such item.The camera takes good pictures for general purpose needs. The automatic functions are good. If your taking pictures at a birthday party, the beach, or a football game your kids are in it works great. Not everyone needs to spend 4 or 500 dollars on a camera...in fact, lots of people can't afford that.This camera is a bargain...it's not the best, it's not the worst, but it works well enough for family pics and fun.If you get a bad one send it back, this happens all the time with electronics, tv's and computers are the same way, i've had to send those back before too. My camera was fine.If night photography is a thing for you then i recommend the Nikon P310, it's cheaper than many that take good night shots at just under 300 dollars, and for the money you get a lot of bang for your buck. Cameras that take good pictures at night cost more, they have F2.0 lenses or better, and that's expensive...3-700 for one of those. If like me most of your pics are daytime shots, then keep your money and get something like this, you don't have to spend a ton just to have fun.It is what it is...a decent cheap camera.My only real complaint...you can't recharge the battery with the USB cord, you have to use the AC wall charger.

I expected a large improvement over the years, but to my surprise this camera is nothing compared to the old Nikon.  All pictures were grainy, even at ISO 100.  Maybe a printed 4x6 would look okay, but when zoomed in on the computer it simply fell apart.  I know these big sensor camera can print much larger, but the jpeg are roughly the same size- I feel the finepix is not producing good quality jpegs.  Gripes: The colors on the LCD were way off and the white balance just looks wrong.  On my computers the photos looked better, it seems to be the LCD's problem.  The auto mode wants to shoot at ISO 800 or 400 all the time.  Is this the sensor's native ISO?  Not good for night time, don't have any clue what other people are saying about this being a good low light camera.  My last camera took much cleaner picture in low light.  The camera does not resolve details- even in daylight.  Pictures just tend to be blurry and lack lines.  The Image Quality is not up to my expectation.  I have a photo buddy with an old Fuji point and shoot, and it out resolves this thing by quit a bit.  I say the megapixel count is simply a selling point but the CMOS is crap.  EXR doesn't seem to do enough to justify any hype.  I prefer the old 10-12 megapixel CCD, thanks.  Camera does not have many useful functions or an advanced menu.  I didn't even try to raw mode, why would I shoot Fuji raw and have to convert it later on, sounds lame and a waste of time.  This thing didn't even come with a software CD.  GPS, good when lost, not on cameras.  The thing is a bit too small too, I feel my hands are swallowing the thing and I can hardly get the SD card out of the slot because it is so jammed up with the door.  And the thing likes to fire off a beam of blue light in low light in order to focus, great for when my daughter is smiling at me or sound asleep in a cute pose.  Furthermore, the lens at the widest focal length is quit distorted, making faces seem fishy.  And now that I think more on it, the lens also flares quit noticeably even in non-direct light.  It gives me these strange purple patches which further reminds me that colors on this camera never pop.  I bought this because I was so impressed by the last model Fuji and I don't particularly care for Canon's look or functionality, and Nikon seems they only make flimsy cheap stuff now.  Disappointed beyond belief, I am spoiled by the Lumix products I bought last year.  I'd say Panasonic and Olympus are making the best mirror less systems for sure.  To note, I have also used Sony to my disappointment if you are considering those new systems.  The Lumix cameras seem to give the sharpest and cleanest, though less saturated than Canon, pictures and have the most functions.  This camera is just not up to par.  Maybe this is good enough for small prints and web publishing, but so is every other 100-300 dollar camera, so why pay a list price of 500 for this?", "Date": "December 5, 2011"}, {"Title": "Disappointed with my Fujifilm FinePix F600EXR", "Author": "kyleob", "ReviewID": "RNL4QDSJQ7GSX", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I have always purchased Canon products in the past.

This was not mentioned in the manual, I had to buy the camera and try it out to learn of the problem. If they want to, Fujifilm can fix the problem by adding one line of text to their RAW files.
