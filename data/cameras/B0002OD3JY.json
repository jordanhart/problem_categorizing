{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Excellent follow-up to A80", "Author": "Luppapa", "ReviewID": "R1YQRUYP36PEKE", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "If someone wants to buy a compact digital camera, most of the times it's enough to choose from Canon models.Canon offers different types of cameras to different people needs.Let's take a look at them if you don't mind, I will try to give a helping hand for those who just cannot decide.Basically there are six line of Canon compacts:1.The G-series - Pros: fast lens, 4x optical zoom, all manual controls, flip-out LCD, hot shoe, optional converters, RAW mode, microdrive support, long battery life (despite of the lithium type!), professional feeling, great hand-gripCons: weighty, big size, lithium batteries (from a point of view), pricey2.The Sxx-series - Pros: wider angle then average (28mm to S60/S70), portability, light, RAW mode, microdrive support, full manual controls, elegant lookCons: fixed LCD, slow lens, PF (CA), lithium battery3.The Sxxx-series - Pros: portability (small size), very light, sexy lookCons: fixed LCD, slow lens, PF (CA), lithium battery, lack of real manual controls4.The Axx-series - Pros: long battery life (due to AA's), flip-out LCD, great hand-grip, full manual controls, optional converters, many scene modes for beginners (on A70 and now on A95), cheapCons: slow lens, PF (CA)5.The Axxx-series - Pros: cheap, uses AA's, portabilityCons: slow lens, PF (CA), no real manual controls6.The NEW Sx-IS series - Pros: big zoom, best video, great hand-grip, long battery life (due to AA's), full manual controlsCons: weighty, slow lens, PF (CA), lack of AF-assist lamp, noisy imagesThat's it, at least at the date of this quick review.As you can see from the above- The G-series has the fastest lens and a hot shoe- The Sxx-series has the wider angle zoom (28mm to 100mm)- The Sxxx-series are the more portable ones- The Axx-series has the best value for it's price- The Axxx-series are the cheapest ones that are also very portable- The Sx-IS-series has the biggest zoom and the best video to dateAll of them - except for the G-series - suffer from purple fringing. The G-series has them also, but not much.All of them has more shutter lag, compared to competition (new Sony and Fuji models).But pls don't forget the high detail in the images that only CANON compacts can bring. A very important issue for me.First, it's a question of money.Second, it's a question of needs.Lastly, it's a question of taste.How much can you afford?What are the most important things you need?What shape/size do you prefer?My suggestion is: decide what are the things FOR YOU that are important when choosing a cam. The decision lies beneath your NEEDS:- Need big zoom or best video? Get an Sx-IS cam.- Need portability? Get an Sxxx-series cam.- Need fast lens, a hot shoe and RAW? Get a G-series.- Need wider angle zoom or RAW? Get an Sxx-series cam.- Do you want to print in big size? Get the highest MP one- You are on the budget? Get an Axxx-series cam.None of the above? Get an Axx-series camera then!The top of the A-line cameras now is the A95 that is a geat, but not perfect cam. There are no perfect ones. Every of them has it's flaws. Pls don't be a maximalist otherwise you won't enjoy the beauty of your own cam. Choose the right cam for you based on your needs. An IMPORTANT advie: don't let the megapixel drive you if you don't need big size prints. It's only marketing, more megapixels doesn't mean better image quality. Keep this in mind always!So I got the A95.I love the LCD, the battery life, full manual controls, shape, hand-grip and the optional converters of the A95.I miss the fast lens, the wider angle and the hot shoe.Weight could be less, but it's quite tolerable and the camera is portable enough for me, if there is a belt-case with you then you won't miss the IXUS. Bigger than the Sxxx-series but much smaller than the G-series. I had an IXUS before (S400) but missed the manual controls and the flip-out LCD, so I had to change.I had an A80 before. The difference is not that much. The A95 has 5 megapixels and a bigger LCD with higher resolution. These are the main differences. They are not much, but enough for me to change, I am one of those people who don't think just buy. :) Do you have an A80? Wait for the next model. Do you have an A60/A70/A75/A85 model? Buy this! That flip-out LCD is a bless.It has a bit more noise - probably due to the more megapixel - than the A80. BUT: it has nicer LCD and a bit faster response times. I don't know why because normally it should be slower because of the bigger file sizes (5mp vs 4mp on the A80). But it's not. It's quicker, but not much. Still, another plus for the A95.The Flexi-zone feature is very useful, ususally found only on higher end cameras. It let's you choose the focus point anywhere in the frame, though I use mine with Center Focus AF most of the time.The extra scene modes are great, I just don't use them so often. I don't like when the camera sets the ISO above 50 when there is no need to.The VGA video is quite useless since it records only 30 secs. What a shame, I really miss that unlimited video! But it's not a deal breaker for me, since it's a camera not a camcorder.The print/share button is not that exciting - at least for me. I know I will never use it.All in all: a great cam. Such as Canon's other models. All of them are great, I started with an A40 and loved that much, that was my first cam. The A95 is the close-to-perfect family cam, I highly recommend it to everyone. It's image quality is top-notch in many ways, it only has a bit higher than average PF that's all, otherwise it takes excellent images out of the cam without any post-processing.Buy it, it's a CANON.", "Date": "September 15, 2004"}, {"Title": "Excellent camera, great value", "Author": "RF", "ReviewID": "R26A3GQUFN4U8R", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "The A95 is an EXCELLENT follow up to the A80, and offers some very nice improvements.  The most noticeable is the jump to 5 megapixels at $100 lower MSRP than the A80 when it came out!  Then there is the larger rotating LCD that is now useable in low light, scene modes for those who don't like to tinker with the settings, and the print/share button to make things easier.  For those who don't know, scene modes are easy-to-access presets of a combination of manual adjustments, optimized for shooting in different situations such as when you are indoors, at the beach, taking shots of kids, shooting at night, or shooting fireworks, etc.  There is also the addition of the Flexi-Zone feature, which lets you choose one of the 9 autofocus spots, so you can focus on non-centered objects!  This is usually a feature only found on much higher priced cameras.  The camera features full manual controls over shutter speed and aperture, manual focus, saturation, exposure compensation, custom white balance, ISO, metering, and a histogram in playback mode.  I know most people think they won't ever use some of these, but when you have an important shot that just isn't coming out, you'll be really glad you have it (or wish you did).  For those who don't know, control over shutter speed means you can use a fast shutter speed to capture fast action or you can use a slow shutter to avoid using a flash or for taking shots of night scenery like a city-scape.The areas where the Canon A75, A85, and A95 really excel at are:Being fairly small(small price tag too!) for a camera with this many features and having picture quality this good.Creative shooting:  this is a great camera for those who want to do creative shooting but can't afford to plop down $600+ for a Canon G6 or more for a Digital SLR.  It's got all of the most important controls, and with your memory card, you can do all the creative shooting and experimenting you want virtually free compared to using film.  It's even expandable with telephoto, wide angle, or close up conversion lenses and there's also the waterproof casing.  One other plus is the flip-out rotating LCD screen, which is VERY useful when your camera is on a tripod, is low to the ground, or when the camera is pointed up but below shoulder height, because you can simply flip the LCD screen to the proper viewing position instead of getting down behind the camera.  You can also use it to shoot over peoples' heads and use it to get a preview when you are doing self portraits.All Canon cameras also come with an excellent software package that lets you stitch panoramic photos, retouch photos or rescue those that came out wrong, add special effect, and view thumbnails of pictures so you don't have to open them up to see what the picture looks like (good for those who are using an older version of windows, I know there are still a lot of you out there).  The best part is that it's free!  It does more than Kodak's software(which is pretty decent), you have to pay $20 to get the better version of Olympus's software, and Sony's editing software is pretty much non-existent.  Those who already have Photoshop won't be excited.For those of you who are concerned that the camera doesn't come with rechargeable batteries, don't worry, it's really not a big deal.  Good rechargeable AA's, type NiMH are super cheap at around $10-$15 for 4, compared to $50 for Lithium Ion battery packs, and at that price, everyone can afford a spare set, which is really important to have.  I've seen people who bought much crappier cameras at the same price, just because they came with rechargeable batteries - not a smart choice in my opinion.Yes, there is the problem with purple fringing, but it's not a very common problem and most people either don't know what it is or don't even know think it's much of a problem when they see it.  Some people think it looks cool.  With full control over aperture, you have the ability to get rid of it or at least reduce it.  Compared to the problems that other manufacturers have with their cameras, I'd take a bit of purple fringing over noise, soft/fuzzy images, and over-sharpening any day!If you are looking to spend much less but want to get pretty much the same camera at 4 megapixels, check out the Canon Powershot A85 or the 3 megapixel A75.  you lose the rotating LCD though.", "Date": "September 16, 2004"}, {"Title": "Another Satisfied Customer", "Author": "Lloyd Ronick \"Gadget Nut\"", "ReviewID": "R3JD05OUNSP5P4", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I bought this camera for a trip to Yosemite, and it didn't disappoint. This is my second digital camera - my first was an Olympus 2MP that I've had for a few years. The Canon blows it away in features and picture quality.I like the size of the camera - it's easy to carry and store (like in my wife's handbag), without being too heavy or bulky. I had considered an ELF, but I didn't want the compromises that the sub-compacts make in features and useability. I had also considered a digital SLR, but that would have precluded the use of the wife's handbag as a storage container. I also thought the SLR's were overkill for someone who's a fairly casual amateur photographer. Don't get me wrong, I've been taking pictures for over 40 years and have used some very sophisticated equipment. But, these days, I want something easy to carry and easy to use. If you're serious about photography, by all means go for the big guns.I won't go into a littany of the Canon A95's features, since others have done a good job of that. Suffice it to say that, except for real photo enthusiasts and professionals, this camera has everything you'll ever need, and more.I took about 200 pictures and a few movies, and viewed them both digitally and in print (Ofoto). They are, almost without exception, excellent. Being new to the camera, and having forgotten the manual while I was on vacation, I didn't come close to using all of its features. I used the built-in scene modes extensively (easily accessible using the rotating wheel that surrounds the shutter button - nicer than having to navigate menus), and they worked as advertised. Some of the scenery shots of Yosemite are really spectacular, rivaling some of the professional shots I've seen for sale (if I do say so myself).  I've blown some of them up to 8x10 and printed them myself, and the resolution is more than adequate. I'm sure I could go up to 11x14 or 16x20 and still get excellent prints (if I only had a printer that could do that - it's on my wish list). I especially liked the panoramic mode - after you take a shot, the previous picture is displayed immediately beside the shot you're lining up, letting you line up the shots almost perfectly. I printed a panorama that I took from one of the Yosemite overlooks on 3 8x10 sheets and it blew me away.Boot-up time is very quick, and the shutter delay wasn't at all offensive. Like most point-and-shoots, you have to hold the shutter button down 1/2 way to get it to set focus and exposure, but once you do that, the camera takes the picture quickly. The delay while the camera stores the image to the memory card is also not excessive (tha camera displays \"busy\" on the LCD while it's doing that).Battery life was excellent. I've been using the I-C3 15-minute rechargable batteries with great results (Amazon carries the Ray-O-Vac batteries and charger, they're also available elsewhere in those electronic shops you find in malls and shopping centers).The swivel LCD is a great feature. I agree with others that talk about it being a little hard to see in brightly lit areas. Of course, you can always use the viewfinder.You'll definitely need a bigger memory card - I bought a 1GB, which seems to hold about 700 pictures at the default resolution. The price of CF cards of this capacity has recently dropped, so I'd highly recommend one or two of these. I didn't change the camera to the super-fine mode, so I don't know what effect that has on capacity. I was able to take all the shots I wanted, as well as some 10-30 second movies and I still had plenty of memory left.My only other minor complaint (other than the LCD visibility problem), is that the maximum optical zoom range is only 3x. If you use the digital zoom, you can go up to 12x, but you lose resolution. Take this into consideration if you need a high-powered zoom. The camera does have interchageable lenses, so that's one way to overcome this limitation (I haven't priced any of the other lens options).Overall, I highly recommend this camera.", "Date": "October 22, 2004"}, {"Title": "A95 review - my first digital camera", "Author": "Dale", "ReviewID": "R35DYXB052LJPY", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "After doing a lot of research I choose the Canon A95.  This is the first digital camera I've owned, although I've used other digital cameras in the past.  It was purchased for a three-week trip through France and Italy.  I used two different memory cards during the trip to take roughly 800 shots.  The first card was a 1GB Viking, the second a SanDisk UltraII 1 GB.  There was no noticeable difference between the two cards, although I never did a specific comparison.Camera Pros:*The rotating LCD view finder is great.  I used the view finder again and again to get shots at odd angles.  I would hold the camera over my head with the view find angled down to see the shot.  Same thing, holding the camera out through a fence to get a shot looking down.  The view finder also worked great to get shots of my wife and myself by holding the camera at arms length.  My only complaint with the view finder is that in bright light, not just direct sunlight, it became difficult to see the image.*AA batteries - this was important for us.  We didn't want a special lithium battery that would be impossible to find out on the road.  We purchased Kodak 2100 mAh NiMH batteries with the camera.  The camera takes four batteries, so we got eight.  I can't tell you exactly how long the camera operates on these batteries, but it's a while.  We took at least 1200 photos, reviewing and deleting bad ones each night.  During 23 days on the road, I went through three sets of batteries, plus an hour on a fourth set.  I was happy with the performance.*Size - we wanted a camera that was small enough to easily carry, but not so small that it was difficult to hold.  Both my wife and I (with very different hand sizes) were happy with the feel of the camera.  My wife didn't care for the location of the on/off button, as she frequently accidently hit it, but I didn't have any problems.*Menu/interface - I see lots of complains about how difficult cameras can be to operated.  I thought the Canon interface was fairly intuitive and easy to use.  Of course, I also read the user guide on the airplane, so I'm sure that helped.*Picture quality (during the day) - most of the pictures I took duing the day look good.  I have not printed any of the images yet, the digital images look great.  Color reproduction looks good and the detail with the 5mp is great.  I'll be having a bunch of images printed shortly, including some larger 8x10's.  If there's a problem with the image quality, I'll post it.Here are a couple cons:*Viewing the LCD in bright light (not just direct sunlight, but any direct light)*Speed - I know this is a general disadvantage of digital cameras of this type and I can't make a direct comparison to other cameras, but after using a standard 35mm film camera, it seemed like capturing a shot took a long time with the camera.*Night shots are very difficult to get without a tripod or stationary object to rest the camera on.  A lot of churches and museums don't allow flash.  We took a lot of blurry, low light pictures. Whenever possible, I set the camera on something to take the shot, but it's not always possible.  Without a direct comparison to another camera, I can't say if the A95 is better or worse than others.*By default, the camera is set to large rather than superfine resolution.  I changed the setting on the camera to superfine right away, knowing that I had plenty of CF memory.  Unfortunately, I didn't realize (even though I ready the manual) that you need to change the resolution setting in each shooting mood independently, so I ended up taking a bunch of pictures in less than the best resolution setting accidently.*Part way through the trip, the camera reset itself to all default settings.  I don't we did anything to reset it, and we weren't changing batteries when it happened.  It only did it once, but it was kind of a pain since I needed to go back through and turn the sound, resolution, and other options back to the way I liked them.*No raw or TIFF capture.  I knew this when I bought the camera, but it would be nice to have under certain circumstances.Overall, I was very happy with the performance of this camera during the first month of use.", "Date": "October 15, 2004"}, {"Title": "My Canon A95 Shopping Saga & Comparison to the Sony T1", "Author": "Abraham H. Silverman \"Abe\"", "ReviewID": "R3GFBADK2BJL1A", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I spent about an hour and a half last night debating between the Sony T1 5 MP and the Canon Power Shot A95.I'm sure my friend and I drove the poor sales clerk crazy - but he was very patient and we examined each extensively.I walked into the store primarily considering three cameras -- the Nikon CoolPix 5200, the Cybershot DSCP 100, and the Canon A95. Going in I'd done a lot of research and found the A95's reputation is outstanding. But Sony's general reputation -- and especially on the Cybershot DSCP 100 -- is outstanding too.The store was out of the Nikon, and since it had been the camera I was least impressed with after reading the reviews, I didn't worry about it too much. The DSCP 100 had all the right numbers and features, but didn't feel right to me for some reason. Maybe the shape threw me off? Honestly, I'm not sure. But the vibe wasn't right and so I asked to see the A95.By this time, the clerk and I had started chatting, and he pulled out the T1. Honestly, I had not come across the T1 in my research, so when the store clerk pulled out this little gem from behind the counter, I was blown away.The thing is tiny. And oh-so-beautiful. The LCD screen on the back is almost the same size as the screen on my Treo 600 -- on other words, huge. The camera felt great in my hands. And a Zeiss lens -- wow. That's top quality there. As soon as I touched it, I began lusting after this mystery camera. But was it any good?But let me digress. The A95 is solid. Just pure solid. Nice quality. Good build. Picture quality looks good. Screen is ... well, small -- especially compared to the T1. The A95 is physically a much larger camera -- though surprisingly, the weight felt about the same as the T1. Controls seemed intuitive and it's got lots of settings to play around with, but that don't get in the way of taking a simple snap shot.But the T1 has the sex appeal. So I kept going back to it. Without reviews, I was flying a little blind, but the fit and finish felt good. And, did I mention the sex appeal?But as I kept looking, practicality began creeping into the deliberations. For instance, the T1 uses a Sony-proprietary battery and memory system. The A95 uses AA batteries and SD memory.There's no way of easily protecting the T1's super-large (and super fragile) LCD screen. The A95's LCD flips around so that the screen is protected by the camera body.The T1 has no view finder and no way to take pictures if you aren't using the LCD. The A95 can be used with or without the LCD (which increases battery life).The T1 has a 3x optical zoom. The A95 has a 3x optical zoom, coupled with a digital zoom.The T1 has no tripod mount. The A95 does.\"Weighing\" in favor of the T1 are the A95's larger size, smaller screen, and the \"cool\" factor of the T1.As I played with both cameras (until the store just about closed), I noted a couple of other things about the T1 in the back of my mind. It wasn't until I read many of the reviews here that these perceptions began to crystallize.Holding the T1 steady is a major issue. (With the A95 I was able to take handheld low-light, no-flash pictures with minimal blurring.) The flash on the T1 was ho-hum. And despite the large LCD screen, telling which images were crisp and which were blurry was a major challenge with the T1. Really, the only way to tell would be to download the images to your computer before deciding which pictures are keepers and which are deleters.In the end, I listened to my wallet and my brain. I bought the A95. I needed reliability and quality more than glamour and glitz. The SD storage cards are about half the price as the Sony cards -- and that issue of the proprietary batteries is a big one.So far so good -- picture quality on the A95 looks good, although I can tell that I'm going to have to learn to use the different \"scene\" settings in order to get the best out of the camera. Even so, the A95 is easy to use. (It even fit perfectly in a cheap generic camera case!) I'll have to post again as I get to know my new camera better.Hopefully you'll find this review of use. In the end -- both cameras are keepers in my opinion. Which one you pick is probably more a matter of personal preference than anything else.

I decided to go with Canon Powershot A95 because of the vast features it provides. Its like a small SLR camera! Last year I saw my friend's A80 and fell in love with it. Although I found a bit shutter lag in A80, A95 was quite ok. The features were very easy to understand and the setup was too. I love the moving LCD although its a bit small. But hey you can take your own pictures without asking anyone to do that for you. I had a bit problem in taking pictures at start.

Means a few things: your LCD is protected when closed (thats a big deal); multiple people can look at it since you can angle it (like you and your spouse); and depending on the light you can angle it to see the screen better.  Also, you can shoot with it closed of course.3) The batteries.  Using your own rechargeable or even disposable is an advantage, not disadvantage!  Gives you flexibility and 6 months from now you aren't buying another $80 special battery like you will with other models.  Thats why Canon does that with some models--people like the flexibility.  We bought a nice rechargeable set for $25 from a local camera store complete with car charger.  (We don't belive you have to use Canon rechargeables)4) The features.  I have already mastered the basics but the abilites this camera has are probably more than we will ever need, but are there if we want.  Like one review site said, this camera will grow with you.5) Size and handling.  Its big enough that you feel comfortable with it in your hand, and the controls are great.  Its not the lightest due to the batteries, but for us its more of a family camera, not some little matchbook I wanted to take out to bars with my friends.  The only thing is that it would probably not be comfortable hanging around your neck if you wanted that.  But on a waist no problem!", "Date": "February 18, 2005"}, {"Title": "Great camera for the price!", "Author": "miket", "ReviewID": "R1P4YY968E4GRI", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "The A95 is a great value and performer for the person who is looking for a feature rich, relatively compact 5mp camera, that accepts standard AA batteries, and takes great pictures.  Since it accepts standard AA's, there are no rechargeable batteries or charger included; only 4 alkalines.I also own a Canon s60, and in side by side tests, the A95 slightly underperforms it, but is still great nonetheless.Given the choice between the s60 & the A95, I would probably go with the s60 (or now the s70).  However, when you factor in cost, the A95 is a winner, and that is why I still gave it 5 stars.The only real \"cons\" I have with the camera are the usual Canon complaints everyone has that the compactflash and battery access door is flimsy and cheap.  This is the case with the A95 more than with the s-series Canon cameras.  Since the A95 takes AAs, the battery door is under tension when you try and close it, and the trick is to use two fingers and press the door down evenly. If you do this, it works flawlessly.  If you don't, you will not be able to slide the door into the closed position due to the fact the door itself will deflect under pressure and prevent the catch from fully inserting into the track it rides in when closing.  Also, if you plan on frequently removing the compactflash card to download images, instead of using the USB, then you may want to consider a different camera.  The compactflash door on the A95 is really difficult to open, and feels like you might break it off when it does open. This is probably more of a \"feel\" than anything else.All in all, the A95 is a great camera for the price.", "Date": "October 8, 2004"}, {"Title": "Great features and control for a point-and-shoot price", "Author": "K. Smith", "ReviewID": "RZSEL9YWVP7NT", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I've had the A95 for about 2 months now and I've been extremely pleased. It is one of those rare cameras that can serve as an excellent and simple point-and-shoot (for my wife) or can be used in such a way so as to satisfy people wanting more control over their photography (for me!). I have owned and used several digital cameras (mostly Nikon, Olympus, and Kodak) and I am continually awed by the amount of options that this camera allows you to mess with to get your perfect picture.A few comments on some of the many benefits of the A95:- Picture quality. This camera has great picture quality. What more can I say? I suppose there is some of that famed Canon \"purple-fringing\" but it is never really an issue for me and the kinds of pictures I generally take.- Vari-angle LCD. I was a little skeptical of the swivel \"Vari-angle\" LCD probably because I thought it would be flimsy or just be a hassle, but now I don't think I could ever own another camera that doesn't have it. It gives you so many options! You can just flip the LCD around to be used just like any other digital camera, or you can maneuver it to take perfectly-aimed photos from above your head, or holding it to your side, or to take a picture of yourself, or even to look around a corner ;). Even if you only use it to turn the LCD inward to protect the screen when you store the camera, this feature is worth the money.- Uses AA batteries. You can buy rechargable AAs and a charger, but you also have the freedom to not have to use expensive propritary batteries. Our batteries went dead while sight-seeing on vacation, so we just bought a pack of AAs at the first store we saw. It's hard to think of any store that doesn't sell AA batteries.- 5 MP. This camera is such a great value for a 5 megapixel camera. When I was shopping for a new camera, I figured I'd have to settle for 3 or 4 MPs for the price range I was looking for. My 8 x 10s look amazing!- Compact Flash Cards. This still seems to be one of the cheapest formats of flash storage media and it also seems to be the sturdiest. SD is smaller, but generally more expensive and flimsier. MS is proprietary to Sony so nobody else uses them. I'm able to use CF cards for many things other than just my camera so they are an even bigger value to me.- Fast startup and picture taking.- Well-written and easy-to-understand manual.Some relatively minor gripes:- It is rather large and heavy for a point-and-shoot camera. The weight doesn't bother me at all and I'm willing to sacrifice smaller size for more functions/control.- CF cover is flimsy and kind of tricky to close. You get the hang of it, but I still worry I'll accidentally break it one of these days. The camera won't operate if the CF door is open (although it seems you could easily \"trick\" the camera into thinking the door is closed). While I worry about this, I've yet to hear of anyone actually breaking it.- Battery cover is also a little awkward to close, but it's not flimsy where I think it'll break or anything.In short, this is a great all-around camera that offers you a lot of control over your pictures.

I did the numbers on the expense and decided that the camera would pay for itself in a year!  I have not been disappointed.  The camera takes sharp pictures at a resolution that approaches publishing quality.Memory Card: I bought a 256mb card with the camera and it will hold 176 full resolution pictures.  That's seven rolls of film worth of pictures!Battery life: I bought Energizer NiMH batteries and recharger with the camera.  I have yet to run out of battery power while shooting.  I took a full card of pictures (176) over several days and reviewed my shots several times and still had battery life.  Not only that, but the batteries recharge in 15 minutes!Features: I have yet to use all the features (14 settings), but took pictures of a soccer game using the sports setting and the pictures were sharp. The macro takes great shots and have had some of my pictures published in a magazine.  The panorama feature let's you take multiple shots and \"stich\" them together on your computer.  The first time I used the panorama feature I did a 12\" x 72\" panorama of Sedona that is breath-taking.  I'm trying to upload some of my shots.Bottom line:  There is no longer a reason to hang onto film.  The quality is there to please all but most discriminating amateur.

C. Harris Jr. \"Norway\"", "ReviewID": "R2TNIDMYS3SKPV", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "After weeks of research on the web (here at amazon and at other places) reading reviews, comparisons, etc. I came to the conclusion that this is the best camera on the market for the price.I bought mine here through amazon about 10 days before I was to leave for a long road trip from Oregon to Hollywood through many great stops such as the Redwood Forest, Yosemite National Park, Disneyland, and other great sites. Thus I was very anxious for my camera to arrive.One week after ordering, I checked to see how far along the way it had come - I was hoping (and expecting) to get it any day. To my disappointment, it had only been shipped the day before (5 days after I placed the order) and I was certain it wouldn't arrive on time for my trip.To my great surprise and relief, the camera was delivered by UPS only a few minutes before I was to leave. (I was packing up the car and seriously on my way out the door when he came.)The point of my long story is that I had no time to read the instructions before leaving, so I had to rely 100% on the camera being self-explanitory and very easy-to-follow for people like me who had frankly never used a digital camera before.Suffice it to say that it was VERY easy to learn, and I was able to get by on my 3,000 mile trip using only the auto functions.Take a look at my pictures (uploaded to the images section for this camera) to see the results.The only features I couldn't find (without looking it up in the manual) were: 1) the self-timer. 2) speed-shooting multiple pics pushing the button once (a series of pictures only miliseconds apart from each-other).As you can clearly see, I am not very experienced with cameras and I don't even know what half the features are called. But I was able to take magnificent pictures without even opening the manual! :)The things I learned that I wish I knew earlier on are:1) when taking night shots, use a tripod or lower the ISO. It was very hard to keep might shots from becomming very blurry. (The shutter is generally opened for longer to allow in more light.) If you are taking pictures of moving objects (such as people) in the dark, and don't want to use a flash (to keep more of the background in or for whatever other reason) you can lower the shutter speed beforehand. Look it up in the manual because it's not easy to explain or very intuitive.2) Most of the time pictures will look better without the flash, but (as mentioned above) you need a steady hand or a good tripod. Sports mode helps a bit as it lowers the shutter speed some.3) When you take a landscape picture where the mountains (or whatever) are dark and the sky very bright, you will notice that the exposure tends to be lighter, taking out much of the detail from the mountains. To fix this, you lower the frame a bit (focus on the mountains with the sky barely visible in the shot) and then lightly press the shoot button and hold it down while the camera focuses. Then (still holding the button half-way down to keep camera focused) slightly raise the camera so your frame is now half landscape and half sky. Then finish pressing the shoot button completing the picture. The exposure stays locked to the darker mountains allowing for more detail in the shot.4) For landscapes or anything more than 10 meters from your camera, everything will automatically be in focus so there is no need to worry about it. (In Yosemite I was often worried that if I focused on a waterfall, rather than the rocks around it the shot might turn out strange, but it all was crisp and beautiful regardless of which I chose to use as the focus point.)Last minute advice: Make sure you...1) get one (or more) 256 or 512 flash card as the measly one that comes with the camera only allows for about 20-30 pictures. I recommend SanDisk 512 which Amazon currently sells for under $40. 512 Mb will give you well over 350 pictures on the default settings. (I believe I got 385 or so on mine.)2) get 2 sets of rechargable batteries and a car-charger.3) get a case with a silky lining that snugly fits your camera so as not to scratch anything. And make sure it has an outside pocket for extra batteries and an extra flash card. I recommend one that closes completely (with a zipper) so it will get protected from rain or if you drop it in a puddle or something.That's all.

Bhavaraju \"Vishnu\"", "ReviewID": "R3K69YZZCGRPPJ", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I did some (infact a lot of) research on buying a digital camera. For a beginner with lot of enthusiasm to experiment with photography, choosing the right camera is the toughest part. I started evaluating basic 3MP cameras and extended my evaluation upto Nikon D70 and Canon EOS20.After more than a month's research, I decided upon Canon A95. It has been three months since I purchased this camera and I am completely satisfied with the product and I can recommend it unequivocally for beginner and amateur shutterbugs (thanks to A95 I am evolving into an amateur from beginner).The best features are it is 5MP, crisp and swivel LCD, a whole range of Manual controls and a whole range of pre-configured shooting modes (including b&w; and sepia), faster focussing, excellent night shooting capability, runs on 4 AA batteries (yesterday I took more than 200 pictures and the batteries are still ready to go) and many more (don't be lazy; find out the other features yourself ;-))Performance:- Excellent picture quality (yes much much better than Sony cameras and Nikon non-DSLR cameras)- Excellent color quality- easy learning curve- I can't stop myself from over-stressing the point - \"ABSOLUTELY no red eye\". I can't imgaine why people pay bunch of additional bucks to Sony (I was Sony fan too, but Sony cameras Su**) to get those Devil eyes. Yes I tested with flash in low light conditions as well, but red eye is not at all there when you shoot with A95- Excellent battery life (I purchased the energiser 15 min charger with 4 rechargeable batteries for 27 bucks and the only complaint I have about the 15 min charger is - it takes 18 minutes for charging 4 batteries :-) )- Excellent macro mode capability- Excellent flash performance (When I decided about this camera, the only point that was pushing me back was non-availability of hotshoe on this camera. I thought I would buy an L-flash set if required, but now I am sure I don't need an external flash)Let's come to bad news - Purple fringing. It is very obvious when you have a bright light focussed onto a shiny surface. It's almost like you can reproduce it at your will. But let me tell you, any 5MP (or more) non-DSLR camera suffers from purple fringing (I am sure you might have heard about DSC F828 and it's infamous purple fringing.). The options to avoid purple fringing are -- Go for a lesser MP camera (and lose some cool features that A95 has to offer)- Go for a Digital SLR camera (and lighten your wallet)- buy some UV filters- use photoshop to reduce the PF from your pictures.Though I have been thinking about buying UV filter, I haven't tried it yet because I have been avoiding PF by selecting different shots.Don't get frightened by all those horror stories about the \"flimsy CF Card door). I agree, Canon could have built a better door, but as long as you are a grownup you can handle the door smoothly.I have a canon optura 20, so I haven't evaluated the mpeg recording mode on A95.Conclusion (ofcourse it is my conclusion) - If your skill level  is beginner-amateur and you are enthusiastic about photography, do yourself a favour and buy this camera. For those who consider themselves above this level, you can also add this camera to your armory as you don't need an SLR for every shot.", "Date": "April 17, 2005"}, {"Title": "For the price, an Amazing Camera", "Author": "Patrick", "ReviewID": "RP9SINGKKJ2PF", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Ok a brief intro and then onto pro's and cons:For the price, this is an amazing camera. I have been studying photography for a while now and was quite the newbie when I originally purchased the A95. After 4 months, and after taking several hundred pics, I can safely say that I have learned very well the strenghts and weaknesses of this camera.It has the size of a point and shoot, but the flexibility of a SLR.So in point, for the 300+ dollars you pay for this camera you are DEFINETELY getting something of better quality that others in the same bracket of price. However, what you are not getting is DSLR quality by any means. (At least $1000.00 for one of those) The powershot series from Canon is fantastic, and the A95 is currently at the top of that series.PRO's: (just to name a few)-Its lightweight, activates quickly with very little lag, and has better than average performance.-Has ISO 50 (rare) through 400-Full manual options-Rotating LCD with auto gain is such an awesome thing I cant even begin to tell you.-Has the ability to take an adapter lens which lets you accesorize with telephoto, macro, and wide angle lenses, as well as an assortment of filters to really get those amazing shots. (which i own and put to good use)-Takes rechargeable AA batteries !  Vs special batteries that cost an arm and a leg.-Its a still pic camera, not a video camera, I am not even going to commment on the shortcomings of the movie feature, its not even relevant to any photographer.-White balance, and autofocus are great and the Canon's DiG!C matrix produces clear and beautifully colored images.-Lets just say it has a TON of options and features that really  make this camera a powerhouse amongst its competitors in the same price bracket.Cons-Anything higher than 100 ISO produces a lot of 'noise' in your pics.-The zoom is really weak-The flash should be in a different position and causes a good deal of 'red eye' even with the red eye reduction feature on. However the software that comes with it removes it easily.-Metering options are close to DSLR, but honestly when you see an SLR pic and features you really become aware of the limitations of this camera.-only comes with a 32mb memory card, pretty much forcing you to  get a larger one.Overall as a mid-range camera between a standard point and shoot and a DSLR I give this a 4 Star rating. 5 would be perfect and since there are cons a perfect score is just not going to happen.If you are going to buy a digital camera just to have one, this camera is going to have more options than you will ever want or use. If however you want to get into photography and dont want to start off with a 1,200.00 price tag this camera is definetely for you !P.S  It will take you a good month to really understand the 'concept' of the options in this camera, and another 3 to be able to really use them and take great pics. Expect to fumble around for a while before you really grasp digital photography.  I recommmend \"Complete Digital Photography third edition\" by Ben Long as a necessary accessory to this camera. Without that book it would have taken me 4 years verses 4 months to grasp digital photography and digital cameras.  Hope that helps. =)", "Date": "April 14, 2005"}, {"Title": "Great Camera.

Taflambas", "ReviewID": "R19B0MYKPN6WQ3", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I researched almost every 5MP camera out there, and in comparison the canon A95 powershot surpasses all others.  Although the only complaint seems to be weight, I believe this is attributed to the fact that it takes four AA batteries.  However, if you purchase the rechargables, they last forever.  I took 12 rechargable batteries with me to my colorado ski trip, and in 7 days not once did I have to replace them!  Also, using regular batteries or rechargables is a lot cheaper and more convenient then having to buy the customized batteries for other cameras.What I LOVE about this camera:- there are numerous not-so-happy comments about how long it takes for the canon to take/record the picture.  You can change this setting!!!! It's in the manual.  ALSO, if you have the factory default setting of \"record time\" of a pic, you can still take a picture while the camera is recording the previous one.  FOr instance, you take a pic, it's on the LCD screen.... you can take another shot right away using the viewfinder.  For pics that would involve high speeds where you would like to take a series of shots, you can change the shutter speed manually, or use the fast/slow shutter speed option on the dial- the flip-panel LCD screen is an excellent feature.  No worries about scratching the screen especially when extreme skiing and you've got this bad boy in your jacket pocket =)- rechargable battery life is extremely long- the optical combined with the digital zoom allowed for extreme close-ups of the farthest of objects... add the macro function and the quality becomes even better- easy to understand and use even for those unfamiliar with different shutter speeds, aperture values,etc.- quality quality and more quality of photos- color and contrast using various settings amazed me!- I like when previewing my picture that I can see what functions were used when the picture was taken, the histogram display, the white balance effect used, and the date- I love the fact that I don't have to fumble with a lens cap!- it's pict-bridge compatible- the \"up to 20\" panaramic shots that you can take blew me away!  The camera allows you to line up the second picture of your panaramic to the first one you took by showing you the edge of the first panaramic photo!The not so positive effects:- as I sit at my desk pondering my camera, ...

There is also some noticeable chromatic aberration in high contrast color transition areas, but that is pretty much par for the course with all digicam zooms. My only real complaint with the A95 is the horrible noise levels at ISO 400, noticeably worse than the noise levels of the A80 at ISO 400. My friend says he's heard that the A95 has significant redeye problems, but we didn't shoot any portraits and only used the flash in fill mode so I can't address this issue.

Canon's reputation for high-quality images is well-deserved. You may find less expensive 5.0 megapixel cameras out there, but if you get a Canon, you'll know where the extra money went. And you won't regret spending a penny of it.- Ease of use. If you're a complete newbie, you can just set the camera in Auto and snap away. But if you're looking for a little more control, it's at your fingertips, and it won't take long for you to learn the menu system. If you've used other Canon digital cameras, you'll feel right at home. (But of course, if you want to know the A95's functions inside and out, there's no substitute for reading the well-written manual.)- Lots of shooting options. There are some 14 different shooting modes available to cover just about every conceivable situation. Personally I use only two or three, but it's nice knowing they're there.- A great lens. Canon has long been known for quality lenses, and the one in the A95 is no exception. It features 3x optical zoom and a maximum aperture of f/2.8--shoot near and far, and in a wide range of lighting conditions. (Quick tip: to shoot indoors or in low light without using the flash or a tripod, change the ISO setting.)- Flexible (but somewhat slow) autofocus. The autofocus system automatically selects between nine points, making it easy to capture off-center subjects with ease. Unfortunately, it can be tricky getting subjects in motion, especially in low-light situations. This takes practice and a bit of trial-and-error to overcome. Hopefully Canon will address this shortcoming in the future.- \"Vari-Angle\" LCD. This is the feature that won me over. It can be manipulated very much like many camcorder LCDs, flipped out from the camera body and turned to face a wide range of angles. With the screen turned to face the same direction as the lens, you can even use the A95 as a mirror! And when the camera is not in use, the screen can be folded into the camera body, protecting it from damage. The screen measures 1.8\" diagonally and is clear and crisp, even in harsh sunlight.- Size and weight. The A95 is a lot of camera in a little package--at least compared to a full-featured digital SLR. It's compact, but not pocket-sized (unless you have rather large pockets). If you don't already have a gear bag or a purse, I recommend getting a case with a shoulder strap if you plan on carrying it around a lot. Also, the A95's got a decent amount of heft to it. Personally I don't mind the weight; coming from the professional world, I like the feeling of something solid in my hand.- Batteries and battery life. One reason the camera weighs a bit is because it uses four AA batteries. Opinions vary on this, but I consider this a positive. If my batteries die, it's easy to drop in a new set and get going again. The A95 will use either conventional alkaline batteries or NiMH rechargeables; I recommend picking up a set or two of the latter. They're available cheap from a wide variety of places (something I can't say about the proprietary rechargeables found in most other digital cameras, other Canon models included).My only complaint in this department is that there's no visible battery life indicator on the LCD; you're only told when a battery set is on its last legs. I wouldn't worry too much about this. You can get hundreds of shots out of a single set of alkaline AAs and can get even more out of a set of rechargeables, and you can extend battery life further by limiting your use of the flash and LCD. But keep a spare set handy, just in case.- Uses CompactFlash memory. The A95 uses CompactFlash Type I, which is compatible with Canon and Nikon's digital SLRs. If you already have a digital SLR, you'll be able to share memory cards (as long as they're Type I, not the thicker Type II). If you're a pro looking for a camera for casual use, this is something to think about.You'll definitely want to pick up a high-capacity card; you'll only get about 10 pictures, if that, out of the included 32 MB card. I recommend at least a 512 MB card--the bigger the better. I also recommend getting a USB CompactFlash card reader for your computer. Connecting the camera to your computer directly drains battery life (unless you have an AC adapter, not included with the camera). Use that battery life to shoot more pictures!- Attention to detail. Canon's A series may be their \"value\" line, but there's nothing cheap about the feel of this camera. Every button gives solid tactile feedback. The shutter has a well-defined distinction between half-down (to focus) and full-down (to shoot). And thanks to the built-in orientation sensor, photos shot vertically are oriented properly in playback mode. Little touches like these make all the difference.ConclusionThere are cameras that are smaller, lighter, better-looking, less expensive, and with more features. If you want smaller, lighter, or better-looking, try the Canon S or SD series. If you want something less expensive, try the other A series models like the A510. If you want more features, move on up to an SLR like the Digital Rebel. But it's hard to find a camera that can balance all of these considerations as well as the A95. It's a rare gem of a camera that has something for everyone--ease of use for a beginner, more features and control for an amateur or professional. And given the rich feature set and Canon's renowned picture quality, it's an incredible value.", "Date": "July 27, 2005"}, {"Title": "wow!", "Author": "Amazon Customer", "ReviewID": "R38YQSDGXX3NTG", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I just got my A95 after a lot of research.

The price is fantastic for the feature set -- which rivals that of cameras hundreds of dollars more expensive.

Take that as a fact of life.  Unless you carry 10 1k lights around with you - you're going to get some flat, fuzzy and perhaps slightly unfocused pictures in low light settings.  If you want great night shots go for the Prosumer type Canons and buy a tripod so you can use a wide aperture and long shutter speed.In the point and shoot realm you will have to just take a bunch of pictures and know that you will need a good program to really make them shine.  I recommend Photoshop Elements.  You won't find a better consumer level program.This camera takes normal AA batteries so it is a bit heavier than those that recharge the tiny battery in the camera.  With my Energizer rechargeables I never once ran out of charge in a day.  That is with taking hundreds of pictures and turning the camera on and off.  That is very good power management!This camera has a flip out screen for a viewfinder.  It is not the biggest screen you will find on a camera and that is one of the negatives -- but you couldn't have a flip out with a 2 or 2.5 inch screen.  Don't underestimate the usefullness of that flipout!  I can't tell you how many times I was able to get a shot because I was able to orient that every which way.  It is more than just flipping it out -- you can rotate it back and forth too.  And when you flip it around you can put it back in the camera just like all the others with the screen on the back -- plus the image flips to compensate!Image Quality - this is where this camera truly shines.  Colors are vibrant.  Details are crisp.  As long as you have enough light.  Under cloudy conditions or night time then you won't get as good of shots but most can be corrected after the fact if you know how.I have a Sony camera which cost me over $1000 and this camera beats it for quality of photos.  I was also watching a guy in front of me at a concert taking pics with his brand new sleek flat Sony and every picture was blurry.  Mine weren't exactly pro quality but they were better.  Again -- low light is tough for a little point and shoot.You can fit this camera in your pocket if you have big pockets that are loose.  Tight jeans -- forget it.  But you won't scratch this screen like I've heard Elph owners complain about.  I suggest going to a store and trying to put it in your pocket.Bottom line - If you want a great quality camera and don't mind it not being the latest and thinnest camera out there you can't go wrong with this.  To get the same image quality you would have to buy other cameras for several hundred more.

One of my favorite features, simple as it may be, is the rotating LCD screen.  It makes picture taking a lot easier, and you can take pictures at angles you once couldn't (accuratly).The movie mode also worked surprisingly well, I didn't really expect much from that at all.  Another cool feature, perhaps useless, is that you can attach audio memos on pictures you like.Battery life is really good as well, much better than my last camera.The camera is good for lots of other reasons too... but I'm sure you've read most of them.All in all a great camera.

Here something different I can add....I bought and return 4 different digital cameras before I got the powershot A95. The Reason I went through so many digital cameras was because I own a SLR Canon EOS Rebel (I paid $500 for it 8 yrs ago) I absolutely Love my Rebel all my picture come out beautifully clear and I'm Never disappointed but it's not digital. I was so stuck on my rebel that when I used the Kodak, Minolta, Nikon & HP digital cameras (in same price range as canon) they just didn't measure up to my Rebels different setting & photo quality and that is why I would return them!!!Finally I realized I need to try a canon digital and pick the powershot A95 (because of it's small size). I LOVE this camera you won't see me returning it!!!  What I like the most about this digital over the others I've owned is that it has all the setting my rebel has, Plus 8 more setting my rebel doesn't.****For those who have used a Rebel before, if you haven't it's not as hard to use as it sounds below****With my Rebel to get a better blur free photo of my kids moving, I usually had to set the aperture myself, then adjust the ISO then set the filtration (which you can also do on powershot A95) But with the A95 you just set your dial to SCN then pick \"kids & pet\" & it does all the work for you, the picture will come out Blur free every time & you won't have to mess with any apertures, ISO or anything. It also has \"indoor\" setting, if you have a Bright lamp on (like 4-- 100watt bulb fan light) on in the house you can turn the Flash OFF (trust me turn it off and you won't have to worry about red eye either) and the indoor setting will make your picture come out like you used a flash, it's better then Auto setting!!!I agree with the others reviews that the powershot A95 does get red eye sometime (just like you will with any digital with a Built in flash). Here is a tip to keep in mind, the ONLY way to guarantee zero red eye in every picture is you'll need to buy a Digital with an -------Attachable flash------- (means you can take the flash off the camera) attachable flashes have more power, more light and better reflection against red eye but those type of digital cost about $1,400+ !!!

Upon deciding to move up to a digital camera, I researched many brands, styles and models looking for just the camera to fit my wants, needs and pocketbook.I wanted something I could have total creative control over, and yet my husband would be able to pick it up and take great pic's automatically. I spoke to many friends and colleagues and got the skinny on most every well known brand of camera. Over and over, the Canon A series got thumbs up.I put the Canon A95 on my Amazon.com wish list and got it as a Christmas 2004 gift. I have used it almost daily since.One of the many settings is for snow and here in New England we had several heavy snowfalls last winter. I have some beautiful snowstorm pictures taken at night. The detail is fabulous right down to the capture of single snowflakes. The clarity in the depth of these photos is such that you feel like you could walk right into the storm... you can feel the snow.The one thing I am disappointed with is the nice sized, variable position view screen does not have a backlight. That can be a major drawback to someone who takes a lot of pictures in the pitch black. I don't, but there have been occasions where I tried to aim and shoot, praying I'd get the shot. Sometimes I did, others I didn't. What I mean is I could not see WHAT I was capturing, but whatever I did get was fine.I have not purchased any other lenses for this camera (it has the versatility to change lenses just like a 35mm) nor have I seen any advertising for these lenses and other peripherals... I would like to.Battery life is pretty good, you get ample warning when the batteries are low. I forgot extra batteries for my niece's wedding and despite low battery warnings I was able to get all the pic's I wanted. I set mine to turn off according to my needs and this saves battery life.

Its size is great you can pretty easily, stuff it in a pocket.  Now the price of this bad boy is getting up there about $350 at the time of this review.  If you need a point-and-shoot only look into the A85 for about a hundred less.The benefit of this camera is the flip out LCD screen, which is great if you want to shoot around corners and take self-portraits.  The Nikon that I own all have this.  I considered a must-have.  But is it worth an extra hundred that's for you to decide.The camera also has all the extras that make a little more powerful than your standard point-and-shoot. It is aperture priority and shutter priority selection, which is great. If you're new to cameras, shutter speed allows you to control how long the shutter stays open. So the picture you took his dark too dark to use. Just drop your shutter speed from 1/250 of a second to 1/125 of a second this will let in more light. And maybe salvage the picture.That's what makes these cannons so powerful and great if you want to go beyond the basics of point-and-shoot, but it still will be a great point-and-shoot camera.

First I narrowed down my choice to Canon based on reviews on digital camera sites (I spent 2 weeks reading reviews until my eyes felt burned out!). I didn't like the image quality of Kodak, and the Fuji cameras had excellent images but not all the features I wanted - like unlimited continuous shooting.After reading tons of reviews I heard the Canon SD models sometimes have an LCD problem and you are also paying a lot more for their slightly more compact size. If you don't care if it is super small, the A series is actually a much better buy!It is 5 MP and since I do graphic design I do use that resolution, although you won't need it unless you do a lot of zooming in and cropping or enlarging photos. The 3x optical zoom is excellent too. It works well in low light conditions or bright outdoors. The colours are very accurate (important to me for graphic design) and the pictures are clear and very \"real\" looking.It really captures motion well, I have taken lots of horse movement shots and the camera has a setting for fast moving objects that can freeze the action without blurring. The camera feels quality and not fragile or cheap.I love this camera it takes gorgeous photos and has options such as continuous shooting (great for action sequences like a horse going over a jump!) It has an optical plus LCD viewvinder, and you can flip the LCD out or rotate it around in case of glare. It has a \"macro\" function which means you can take extreme close-ups. It takes unlimited movies too - which are good quality (not as good as camcorder but one of the best in a camera I have seen). I have not even explored all the options yet, it has a lot of advanced features so I can grow with it.Also it takes regular AA batteries - not a proprietary battery - so if you run out it's easy to get replacements at the store. I use rechargeable NiMH AA's. Some cameras use special batteries that are expensive to replace when they don't hold a charge (like cordless phone and laaptop batteries).I am extremely happy with this camera!!", "Date": "November 28, 2005"}, {"Title": "Overall, a good camera.", "Author": "MindCreations", "ReviewID": "R1W4WYW2AJK92", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I have had this camera for about three months now and have taken a variety of shots and used all of the different settings and features that come packed in it.  There are some good things and bad things about it, but overall I am satisfied with what it has to offer and the price tag that comes along with it!The Good Things:- Small, light weight- Different modes and features- Manual Mode, Aperture Priority, Shutter Priority- Slow Shutter Speed Effect- Kids & Pets Mode- Vivid Mode to make the colors really stand out- 5 MegaPixels and size resolution to blow up prints to 8 x 11 / 11 x 14 in size- Good for beginners and those that are just beginning to delve into the technical side of photography (good for practice)- Flip out screen.  You may think, why do I need that?  Believe me, it comes in handy for shots where you find it hard to see the screen.  And for travel, it protects the LCD from getting smudged and banged around.  And... helps protect it from fingerprints!- Hand grip- very nice and comfortable in your hand.  Not really tiny and small like some other cameras where you can't get a nice grip and you feel like you're going to drop it!The Bad Things (in my honest opinion):- If you shoot your children (or even moving people) in Auto Mode on a cloudy day, you are going to get blurred pictures.  To be safe, always use the Kids and Pets setting.- Noise - this camera has a noise problem, which will make your print out look `grainy'.  I am not sure why it has so much noise, I am thinking that it's because of the small sensors packing that 5 MP together when it saves to your card, but I can't be sure.  This is the biggest disappointment for me.  With my SONY Mavica 2 MP camera, noise barely existed.  If you make a jump from a small MP camera to a larger one, this is going to be an issue, especially in low light situations.- Purple fringing.  On a bright day, if your subject is white and the sky is bright, or there are lights nearby and the subject has on a bright shirt, you will find that along the edges of their clothing will be a small purple `haze' effect.  You may be the only one to really notice it, but others might.- Red eye.  Unless your subject is looking directly at the `red beam' on the camera when taking a picture using the flash, you are more than likely going to get red eye.  This can be easily taken out with a graphics program, but it is still a pain in the butt to deal with.- ISO only going up to 400- and at that, the noise is awful!  For normal picture takers, if you plan on taking pictures at a sporting event, don't even mess with the ISO Setting.  Just use the Sports Mode on the Dial.  And make sure the game is outside in the day time.  Otherwise, noise is going to be in your prints and you may be disappointed with the results.- Zoom is only 3x, you might not get as close to your subject as you would like when zooming.----Like I said, there are good things to this camera, and some bad, but all in all, I think that it's a good investment for those who want a higher megapixel camera with more features to play around with.I've uploaded some pictures I've taken in the \"Customer Images\" section, but all the photographs there are helpful.", "Date": "April 13, 2005"}, {"Title": "Excellent step up from my S400 Elph", "Author": "L. Wimberley", "ReviewID": "R1SMR295G8SE7T", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I recently replaced my Canon S400 4MP Elph with the Powershot A95.Right away, the main differences are:Larger size, partly due to the use of 4 AA batteries.  the compartment where the batteries are stored make the camera have an excellent grip which makes the camera friendly for larger hands then the Elph series does.  (I'm a woman in my 20's, and I have small hands so this doesn't really affect me)The batteries, being AA's, not a rechargable Lithium Ion like the Elph, can be easily be bought at any store that sells AA's cheap if you run out while you're on vacation (which will happen often, as digital suck the life out of normal AA batteries)Saying that, I STRONGLY encourage you to purchase rechargable Ni-MH batteries.  I bought the Sony Super Quick BCG34HC charger, which also comes with 4 2300 Ni-MH batteries.  The batteries lasted about a week and a half of heavy picture taking with the the flash on and off, along with the display on.  For and extra twenty bucks on Amazon, it's worth it.The LCD is slightly larger.In addition, the LCD also flips out and around!  You can easily frame and take pictures of you and a friend without having to use the self timer.The manual features are far supieror to the Elph series.  The A95 Powershot allows manual focusing!  And aperature settings!  This is a far improvement and gives you a little more creative control over images.  The camera still has a complete auto setting should you just want to use it as a simple point and shoot.The lenses on the Powershot A95 are interchangable.  You can buy telephoto lenses for it (though you must also purchase an adapter for any interchangable lenses for this camera)  I think the idea is cool, but the lens and the adapter are NOT cheap.  If you bought the camera and the lenses and the adapter, you could spend an extra fifty or hundred dollars and then just get the digital rebel which would allow total creative control with fully manual settings.  Again, a fun idea, but maybe try to find the lenses used at a cheaper price.The camera turns on quickly like the Elph, and has the same small shutter lag.  It's not bad, but in low light it takes extra time to focus.The only qualm I really have with this camera is the LCD screen is WAY too bright.  Images look washed out and have innaccurate colors on the LCD screen then when you get them on the computer and print them out.  And the worst part about it is, you can't fix it.  There is NO way to adjust the brightness level of the LCD screen.  On the S400 Elph, you could adjust the brightness level of the LCD screen, on the A95 you cannot.  I like seeing my images how they will look when I am changing controls so I gett a correct picture the first time (the whole point of a digital camera!)  I think this is an oversight on Canons part and the brightness option should be included on future models.Basically, what it comes down to is, if you want a camera just for keeping in your purse and using it at parties and simple settings and the like, I would always reccomend the Canon Digital Elph Series.  They're small and have incredible image quality.However, if you want more createive control and the ability to use some manual controls, by all means buy this camera.  It can be easily used as a point and shoot, but it really is so much more.All in all, I'm very happy with the camera and all of the scene modes and extra controls.

It's main goal is to try to be a G series camera for 300.00. In this regard it falls short in both speed and sharpness, but not by much. As with all P&S; cameras of any price, the A95 poses quite a few obstacles to the shooter. Focus lag, limited F-stop range, punchy flash are among them. On the other hand it has excellent color balance (a big problem for cameras like the Nikon 8800, ALL Panasonics, Konica Minolta Z5 and so on). Sharpness is average for a camera in this class. For sports, kid photography and any highly critical use, most advanced shooters won't be happy with anything less than a DSLR. I bought the A95 for use on the job and as a backup camera. On the other hand the average shooter will probably LOVE the A95. It's a remarkably well made camera capable of taking great shots with some practice. If you don't need giant prints 11X14 or larger, a camera like the A95 is probably a smarter buy than many of the prosumer units currently available. Also keep in mind that those long zoom cameras do best outdoors in bright light where their contrast based focus systems work well. The A95 works best OUT of it's full auto modes. Learn to use the manual settings and you'll be taking plenty of great pictures. I highly recommend the Canon A95, but do your homework carefully and try one if possible. It's a solid pick for a family camera, enthusiast seeking a well priced starter camera or as a backup for your DSLR.Pros> Superior handling and ergonomics compared to compacts> Reasonably sharp for mid size camera> VG AF system> Bayonet lens system for additional lenses> Nice viewfinder> Great swivel LCD> Easy manual control> Amazing color balance for a P&S;> Excellent macro mode> usable manual focus> Powerful flash> Solidly builtCons> Noise above ISO 100 as with all P&S; is limiting> Focus lag as with all P&S; limits use for getting fast kiddy pics and such.> Dual menu system sucks> Limited F-stop range just like most P&S; cameras> Camera is heavy with 4 AAs> mediocre movie mode> Flash blows highlights in AUTO modes in certain conditions> AF assist should be brighter> No remote option! C'mon!Compared to:The 8800: The Canon can't match the Nikon 8800's quality and lens no way-no-how, but it shoots faster and will get more shots in focus. It also has far better color balance than the 8800 by a royal mile. Outdoors the Canon can't compete at all. Indoors I'd rather shoot with the Canon.The Pentax Optio S5i: The tiny Pentax lens did very well by comparison, but the Canon has the edge for color and sharpness. Pentax had better low light AF, but longer focus lag.The Sony L1: I love the L1. It fails in ergnomics but it's a ultra compact anyway. If not for the memory stick pro I might have bought one. At 199.00 its a steal! The A95 won out due to being able to share my D70 cards.The Nikon D70: The Canon's only advantage over the D70 is it's size. For some applications, the Canon's swivel display might also give it a leg up. The D70 has no movie mode of any kind. Beyond that the D70 simply takes better pics than any P&S;/Prosumer.

It cost me $299.99 at Fry's Electronics and everywhere I've looked, it's that same price.This is a very comfortable camera to be held in the hand, even if it is a bit thick. Having immediate family members that didn't like flat-faced cameras such as the Canon Elphs, I considered getting a Canon A series. I previously owned an A70 and now I have upgraded to an A90. I am simply ecstatic about this camera - definitely worth it! The picture quality is amazing for the price! With 3x Optical and 4x Digital zoom, you can be sure to get the photos you need. Sporting a nice 5 megapixels, this is a great camera for simple family vacations to really shooting breathtaking scenes like waterfalls or canyons, etc., that demand quality when you can't afford to have bad pictures! Canon A series has always had a good number of shooting modes, this model having 14! It pays to read the manual so that you can maximize the most of this little wonder. Practically everything is customizable and easy to change - you can stitch photos together with ease to form panoramic shots, choose from 8 different scene modes like foliage, snow, beach, and so forth, and much more.One thing I like about this camera alot is that it is not hard on your budget. This is not like those other money-saving cameras that may give you a few good features at the cost of other critical features. You get everything you pay for plus some with the Canon A95. Also, it uses CF (Compact Flash) memory cards - cheap, high speed, and lots of space for all the photos you need to take. Included is a 32 MB memory card with the camera, but you should probably upgrade to at least 128 MB ($14.99), or even better, 256 MB ($29.99). This may seem alot for extra space, but compared to Sony Memory Sticks (only memory format that Sony uses) which take a heaping bite out of your wallet, you won't regret buying a bigger memory card.The LCD screen is revolutionary on the A95. Measuring in at a comparitively small 1.5 inches, it nevertheless delivers crystal clear photo viewing. If you prefer bigger LCDs, sorry, but in this camera's price range, generally alot of small LCD cameras are the most popular either way as they tend to have the best quality (Konica Minolta G500 and G600!) This LCD flips out of the  case like a video camera recorder and then you can flip it around and set it back in so that the screen faces you! That way, when the screen is in its original position, it can't be scratched! A very valuable feature in the camera field. The software included is relatively easy to use - install the CD and plug the camera into your USB. You can even manage photo transfer on the camera itself instead of using your computer's keyboard. The USB is fast and the cord is long, so if you have USB ports on the back of your computer, don't worry - the cord is long enough for you to safely extend the camera onto your desk.The only possible \"con\" I could find in this doesn't have to do with picture quality or lack of features; It's the fact that this camera (as well as all of the A series) takes 4 AA batteries. The camera battery life is fine and all, but be prepared to take a charger and maybe 2 sets of 4 Rechargable NiMH (Nickel Metal Hydroxide) batteries when you take this camera with you on vacations. The batteries are about $10.99-12.99 for a 4 pack (I use Energizer, my camera gets alot of power out of them). Included with the camera is 4 cheap Panasonic alkaline batteries, which generally run out fast.Overall, however, I would highly recommend this versatile, virtually perfect camera.

So I've made a habit of checking the dial frequently to be sure it's in the mode I intended (which for me is usually \"AUTO\" mode).I've had the camera for 7 or 8 months now, have taken thousands of pictures, and have been delighted with it.Another aside: I don't use the Canon software (although I used Canon software with an earlier Canon camera).  To transfer the pictures to my computer, I use a \"card reader\" (available for $10 to $20) that plugs into a USB port; when I insert the CF card into the reader, the card looks like a disk drive to the computer, so I just copy and paste the files to where I want them.

I've taken over 3000 pics with it and am very very happy with the results. I got it when it was $100 more than it streets for now, and still think it's a great deal.LOWDOWN: If you're like me and would rather concentrate on enjoying the moment, yet be able to take pretty darn good shots when you want to without lugging all that equipment around for an SLR/DSLR, then this is the cam for you. The A95 has that important balance between pocketability, fit-to-hand, weight, and great optics and sensor.Plainly put, i find that I have the cam with me when the opportunity presents itself, whether it's a great moment or planned shot. So I take the picture, instead of wishing i had lugged all the equip around. I just do some exposure bracketing just in case, and I'm good to go. The controls are easy, and for anyone going from 35mm SLR to this, the controls are there for you to make sure that you take a good shot. Aperture priority, shutter priority, ASA film settings, etc..For the lazy snapshooters inside of all of us, there are enough quick settings to use that you can pretty much be guaranteed a good photo as long as you use a little intelligence.But what about the pictures? Folks compliment me all the time on my shots, and ask about my SLR. There are about 30 photos posted on my office wall (use a real silver halide service and skip the crappy home printers). These are anything from 5 x 7 to framed 22\" x 30\" posters. They all look pretty damn good because of 5MP plsu smart ASICs that Canon has (plus the ability to edit them easily when needed with Photoshop Elements.)I don't bother with the share functions, just pop the compact flash in my card reader and Elements just sucks it right in - simple.Great sensor that can simulate up to 800ASA film (maybe faster), i think, so under most circumstances, with subjects that are not moving much, it works great. And the Scene settings work well. You should see the great Fireworks shots i got this weekend. BTW - maybe I'm not discriminating enough, but i haven't conticed a big 'purple fringing' problem.This is my third DSC - had a Fuji 900 - great cam, takes better pics than my Olympus, but too big to slip into pocket; Olympus c70(?) camedia - nice lens, but needs image stabilization to take advantage of the ling lens. Not great images - lots of noise at low light settings.This review would be five stars if not for the programming of the flash (need a slower, softer flash, or a hot shoe that i can control). The flash, when used in less than 8' from the subject, has a tendancy to blow out the details. So I shoot with natural light whenever I can. And of course, i would love if the A95 had the responsiveness and no shutter lag like a DSLR - but for hundreds less, it's quick enough.The A95 will probably remain my main camera for some time. I may even skip plans for getting a DSLR, instead I'm ordering the A95 accessory lenses, so i may never need a DSLR....p.s. Make sure to get a couple or three of 512MB cards - they're cheap enough now, and if you use the top resolution setting, you'll find that a card fills up on a weekend trip.", "Date": "July 14, 2005"}, {"Title": "I love this camera!", "Author": "Nana Takamitsu \"Lissu\"", "ReviewID": "R2EGSMK4ANMNLI", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Someone on the review earlier said there were some reviews written by Canon salesman, but I doubt it.

Now, it didn't do it all the time, only occassionally. When composing my shot using the lcd screen (live view), the lcd screen would distort, almost appearing like it was placed next to something magnetic. Strange waves of green, and a digitized looking picture took over the screen. This distortion did'nt just stop at the lcd screen. This effect was recorded onto the image as well.I thought the camera was officially a paper weight, but then I got on amazon and found reviewers discussing the same thing. I checked out Canon's website and after searching for my make and model of camera, I found an alert about the distorted lcd screen. Apparently, Canon purchased a batch of CMOS sensors from Sony around the time this and several others cameras were produced. Well, some of those sensors were faulty. So Canon will fix them for free. I just called their 1-800 number and spoke to a very nice woman who set me up with a UPS shipping label. I mailed the camera off, and recieved an email in a few days saying that the camera was eligible for the fix and that it would be fixed shortly.

The amount of megapixes is the perfect one because it's over 3MP that is more or less the quality of the film cameras and is does not produce pictures that are too big for any memory card lick the 7MP cameras.

I only need about a 1 to 1.5 mb file size to get an excellent 5x7, which is really the largest size I would ever need for this application.  Plenty of features, including a full Manual setting if you need it.The only negative so far is that it does not focus very well in moderate to low light, especially at the higher focal lengths (and accompanying higher F stop)but I guess that's understandable for a slower lense.  To compensate, in lower light I tend to shoot at the widest zoom settings.Overall I am extremely pleased with the results for a point and shoot.", "Date": "July 26, 2005"}, {"Title": "Glad I stepped up from A75 to A95", "Author": "Amazon Customer", "ReviewID": "R3LYRF5VVQ3AIU", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "When my husband told me he wanted to buy me a new digital camera to replace my three year old camera, I told him heck no! I knew how to use my faithful Canon A70 inside and out, and I was not looking forward to the learning process for using a new camera.I knew I'd love the clarity that additional megapixels would give, as well as the numerous enhancements Canon adds to their products as you go up the product line. Yet my answer was no to a new camera.Fortunately for me (unfortunately for my spouse), I had a few moments recently, and I was able to download a PDF file of the manual for the Canon PowerShot A95. I discovered I could easily transfer the skills I learned by using my Canon A70 to this new camera as well as benefit from the many added perks. I went to a brick and mortar store to see the camera and hold it and discovered, with my long fingers, the camera fit as confortably as my A70. By the way, the camera feels extremely light and off balance out of the box (and in the store), but add the four AA batteries and the camera is weighted perfectly.So I said yes to the Canon PowerShot A95, and I LOVE IT!I had to get another lens converter for my new digital camera, and the A70 telephoto lense does not fit on the A95, but the wide angle lens does. The A95 also fits in my old camera case, and I carry it with me everywhere. The A95 turns on faster, and recovers from a shot quicker than my old camera. The LCD screen view is crisper and can be used in daylight easier (it's not perfect, but it's better than the A70).Canon has made a computer software upgrade with added features, yet navigating through it wasn't difficult (since it was very similar to my old camera's computer software). The mini-movie feature works great indoors and the subject doesn't have to yell to be picked up by the camera's built in mike. It's good outdoors but not for speeches. With playback, the camera speaker is sufficient. The camera is even capable of playing a mini movie or showing the pictures on its card via a television once you connect the camera to your TV (cord included).Canon has done it for me again, and I highly recommend this camera to anymore who wants a 5MP camera-size device that is easy to use, easy to program, fits comfortably in an adult's hand and provides stunning results.If you're looking for one of those slim cameras, pass this one by.

Gallay", "ReviewID": "RCUHUEBYI3I60", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "For months prior to purchasing my Canon Powershot A95, I researched digital cameras and found that, across the board, the A95 was highly-rated. Finally, on my birthday, I ordered it -- and anxiously awaited its arrival.When it arrived, I was elated -- the camera itself is gorgeous, packed with features and easy to use right out of the box. However, within minutes I noticed a small blue square visible on the LCD screen. It was a \"hot pixel,\" which -- as I understand it -- is a pixel that's receiving too much information (as opposed to a \"dead pixel\" which is a pixel that's not receiving any). Disappointed, and wanting to start off with a camera in mint condition, I called Canon and was told that they would only repair or replace a camera if there were between four and six hot pixels visible. So, as a second resort, I signed onto Amazon and requested a replacement; UPS picked my camera up the next day and two days after that, my second A95 was delivered.Thrilled, I opened the package and tried out the replacement. All was well until, a few hours later, I noticed a one white pixel and one red pixel on the LCD screen. Hoping that perhaps the pixels were only visible on the screen and not on the actual photos, I transferred the test images to my computer (via a card-reader) and found, to my chagrin, that the red pixel was present on the images themselves. Frustrated, I contacted Amazon again and was this time told that they couldn't send out a second replacement but would instead issue a full refund, along with a ten dollar credit to use towards a future Amazon purchase.Needless to say, I'm quite discouraged and am now wondering if there is something wrong with the latest batch of A95s which was not present until now. Though I'm s till convinced, thanks to so much positive feedback, that this is quality item, I'm wary of purchasing another -- at least without field testing it at the store of purchase first.**Update**I did go ahead and purchase this camera again -- this time from a brick-and-mortar store.

It uses the Canon Digic processor also found in their higher quality SLRs. The display screen hinges outward and rotates which protects the surface when stored and allows you to view it from in front or behind the camera. I've read complaints about shutter lag time on the A95 but most all small digital cameras suffer from some degree of shutter lag.

My first digital camera, I bought it as a going-away present for myself, since I was spending the summer living and working in Spain and knew that I needed a camera that could keep up with my travels.It was a snap to take out and set up, and intuitive enough that a couple of cursory glances at the Quick Start guide had me well on my way to pointing and shooting. The camera comes with a USB cable, several software programs, a 16 MB Compact Flash card (of course, you'll want to invest in more memory as soon as possible - with the highest-resolution photos, consider a 512 MB or larger card), batteries, and a wrist strap.I would rate the camera as mid-sized. It is not wafer-thin, but neither is it absurdly bulky or heavy. For most of my traveling around Spain, I simply slipped it into its bubble wrap and into a soft fabric bag, where it fit comfortably in my purse.  The design is comfortable to shoot with over long periods, and I found the layout of the buttons to be intuitive.  Less is more: there are few external buttons (shutter, on/off, menu and related buttons), and most controls are carried out through the on-screen menus.  The flip-out LCD screen is one reason I decided on this Canon over others in the PowerShot line; it makes previewing photos a snap, and can be swiveled 180 degrees.The photo quality (I kept it on large superfine) is astonishing: clear, sharp, vibrant photos (check out some of my uploaded photos using the Canon A95) in true-to-life tones with minute detailing. There are various shooting modes, including manual, macro, panoramic (with Stitch Assist software), nighttime, slow shutter, and more, and a movie mode that captures brief (jerky) videos with tinny sound. This isn't a camcorder, so I wasn't surprised that video quality wasn't better, since I bought this primarily for photos.You will also want to invest in a few basic accessories: rechargeable NiCad batteries and a rapid charger, a sturdy case, and a bigger memory card, for starters. Although the included software is capable enough to get the job done, consider upgrading to Adobe Photoshop Elements (around $90), or if you're a pro, Adobe PhotoShop CS 2 (several hundred dollars).

For beginner, you can stick with the auto setting and the special scenes setting.  You could take very good photos with these settings.

One reviewer mentioned something about not knowing how to deal with red-eye reduction and strong flash light.  For this camera, you could actually control the amount/intensity of the flash output (in the M Mode) as well turn red-eye reduction on and off by making changes in the menu setting.  I am very sensitive to flash. My eyes would automatically close when the camera flashes in my face.  Now I often use very low output of flash, or don't use flash at all (The great thing about this camera is that you can change the aperture value so that you don't even have to use flash at all when you are in a dark room.  This is great for me to capture photos of dogs and cats).I was able to take beautiful night scenes of the city and university campus (without flash, of course) by adjusting the aperture value.

And I have few complaints. I don't take a lot of pictures. I hadn't taken more than 150 in 18 months time.I've been very happy with it though. The pictures come out great.I decided on Canon because they are known to have the best Linux compatibility. However, it didn't dawn on me at the time that the computer I had just bought has a media card reader. Therefore Linux compatibility is not an issue.Any OS can handle media card readers and it's much simpler to pop the card into the reader than hook up a USB cable.I do wish I'd done more research on media types. If I were buying today, I'd pay more attention to the Canons that take the much smaller (in size) SD Media cards. For some reason that media is often half the price of the CF media that the A95 takes.The cameras that take the SD media often come with rechargeable batteries that are smaller too. The Canon A95 does not come with batteries. It just uses plain old AA batteries (I've since bought rechargeable AA batteries to use with it).The point to all this is that the bigger batteries and flash memory make it heaver and bulkier. I must say though, that I actually do like the the idea of AA batteries. I find that more convenient then the built-in rechargeable types. The trade-off of course, is the size they add to the camera and the expense. But since I take few pictures, that's not a problem.The image quality is excellent. 5 Megapixels gives you a lot of image to play with if you with to crop/edit and then produce a 4x6\" or 8x10\" image for printing.If you want to tweak settings for your particular environment, the A95 gives you quite a few options. Most of these I'll probably never bother with. \"Auto\" has worked out quite well so far.One of my favorite things is the 1.8\" LCD on the back. It's good sized AND it folds out so you can turn it around facing forward. That comes in handy for \"self portraits\". There's no guesswork involved like with most cameras.That's probably the single biggest feature for me. It's how I finally decided on this model (I suppose that's another trade-off for the bigger size of the camera now that I think about it).And even better (for you anyway). It's dropped in price. I bought it in December 2004 on Amazon.com. As of this writing (June 2005), it's almost half the the price I paid for it.I'm sure that's due to the newer models Canon has since come out with. I suppose the A95 is near the end of it's life cycle. Frankly I think this is even more reason to get this camera. It's a great value.The Canon A95 is a great all-around camera for those who like \"point-and-shoot\" cameras that offer more than just standard features, options and settings.", "Date": "June 2, 2006"}, {"Title": "GREAT camera", "Author": "I.P.", "ReviewID": "RVQ2I0ZRP1SOM", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I've had this camera for one year exactly. It's survived weddings, bar mitzvahs, and vacations in countless countries. It is dependable. Let me tell you why else this camera should be considered-(1) A flipable LCD screen. This means that if you're at a bar or another crowded place with the misses you don't have to ask someone to take a picture. You just flip the screen and shot it yourself. For a traveler like myself, this is great. You can bet during New Year's in Trafalga Square that I wasn't about to ask the drunk next to me to take a picture of me and my friend. I know of no other camera that has this. In addition, the screen is protected when you flip it in. Sure, the newer 4 inch screens seem great, but they look kinda fragile.(2) The price is decent, especially now that newer models have come out.(3) 5 megapixels?!?! That means you can print out a 16\"x22\" with no problem in photo-quality. Everyone wants to know the megapixels of your camera, like that's what makes it good. 5 is more than fine, most people only need 3.(4)The panoramic feature IS AMAZING!!! I will upload them to the pictures tonight when I get home from work. I took a 7 photo-long panoramic shoot of London and it is simiply amazing. You can zoom in and see the time on Big Ben!!!! Wow. I am still learning new stuff about my camera all the time.Cons-The size of the camera is a bit chunky, but I don't like having to depend on rechargable NiHm that are $50-70 each. Instead I have a few pairs of recharable AA's that have lasted me over a year and were $10.I am about balancing price with quality: period. I don't care that the newest Canon can take 10 minutes of movie and can act as a webcam. I use my camera for taking pictures and short video clips, that's it.

Here's why:1. The pop-out screen. Perfect when you are in a crowd. You can just tilt the screen, rais your arms and you KNOW what you'll be shooting.

The con: It probably makes the camera a bit chunkier, but to me it's worth it.2. The pixel size. It's around 5MP and it is just right for all-around shooting. It isn't too small where I lose details but it isn't too big where I'm having to always free up space on my computer. The con: I would prefer more MP's but, for this camera, it will do fine.3. The controls. I found that it is simple enough for all-around 'point & shoot' shots but it also has features that you can control. I choose to use my manual shutter and aperture settings to control my pictures. But if I hand my camera to somebody who has no idea how to use one, they could just hit the button and shoot. The con: The settings can seem to overwhelm the beginner...at first, but after reading the manual for a bit, it should help with that.4. The size. I am comfortable with it's size. But I know many would prefer a smaller one. (I guess that would be the con of it.) It feels solid and well made. The screen is not too small and the lense does a decent job in getting the shots you want. I use a cushioned carrying case for it and it can be a bit bulky BUT I'd rather protect it with something like that. This can be a bit chunky for your pocket but it can still fit. (Don't forget to grab yourself a camera strap for added protection against drops!)5. Canon. I've owned Canons for a while and that is the brand I will stick to.

I always thought that with a point and shoot, you were stuck with poor lighting and strange hues.  However, the manual settings on this camera make it relatively easy to make your pictures look less like disposable film camera snapshots and more like photographs.  At first, I thought the rotating LCD was a little silly and extravagant, but it is wonderful for two reasons.  First, you can fold it away when you store the camera in a bag (or pocket) and save your screen from the scratches and dings that normally happen when you use a digital camera.  Second, it works really well for taking self portraits or shots from over your head (say, if you're in a crowd of people.)  The scene modes are a bit of a novelty, but a good place to start.  The manual mode (where you can actually control the flash intensity) is far more useful.  Another great feature is the custom white balance.  If you really can't be bothered figuring out the difference between incandescent, fluorescent H and regular fluorescent light, just point the camera at a white t-shirt and press a button.  The camera is now set for your lighting.  If you want to get artsy, do the same thing with something blue or pink and get effects similar to color infrared film.

I had high hopes for it.BUT UNFORTUNATLY it let me down big time....I researched for weeks to find the best digital camera. i researched all over the web on Olympus, Kodak, Canon, Nikon, Pentax, Sony ... all of them. I decided on a Canon b/c they seem to get such great reviews, especially here on Amazon. The praise on here for the Canon A95 really helped sway my decision. I love digital photography and take a lot of pictures though i am by no means a professional. I mostly wanted a nicer camera than my HP435 (a cheap 100 dollar cam). I bought this powershot a95 based on all the great reviews. i mostly take pictures of my children, who are young.I wanted a good sized megapixel (not too high but more than 3 b/c i print 8x10's often). i teetered on the thought of a higher zoom camera. still debating on the Kodak 7590 which has a 10x optical zoom and 5 or 6 mp. that cam doesnt have any stabalizer like the  canon s1 has (and a 10x zoom but a small mp). I eventually decided against a higher zoom camera and on this a95 b/c everyone said how great it was. i thought i would be able to take quality photos of my kids.Unfortunately the cons of this camera are a big deal for me. It has the problems i was trying to AVOID.CON #1 :  in a lot of my shots, everyone has red eyes. i read the instruction booklet page by page and turned on the redeye reduction but to no avail. red eyes. up close were okay but when the subject got 3 feet away...red eyes. i know i can photo edit them out but i shouldnt have to. a 400 dollar camera should do that for me!CON #2: (the most important thing to me) the time from me pressing the button to take the shot to the time it actually takes the picture is ridiculously long! my kids make a cute face and by the time the camera takes the shot, they have changed faces and/or moved out of the shot. In this respect, my old 100$ hp did a way better job. it was very quick to take the picture. i pressed the button and the picture was taken. not on this camera. i press the button and i guess it is getting the shot perfect b/c it pauses for literally SECONDS then snaps. The picture i do get of say the top of my kids head or the sides of their faces (b/c they MOVED) is a very clear nice shot though.i would say that if you want to take pictures of a still object then this camera does a Great job.BUT---> if you are looking for a camera to take pictures of your small toddlers who won't sit still, do not get this camera.the worst part too is that i bought this at Best Buy and it came with a restocking fee sticker of 15%. SO if i return it, they charge me a good 60 some odd dollars to return it. ridiculous! they didnt tell me about that! so Avoid purchasing at Best Buy unless you are absolutely sure OR you dont mind paying a restocking fee.My sister recently bought the Kodak 7590 and i am going to play with it for a week or so and review it as well.We go down to Florida alot and play w/ the dolphins. (the animals not the team haha) I dont think this camera is going to do a good job taking pics of them either b/c of its slow picture taking time. I imagine i will press the button in time but by the time the photo actually TAKES, the dolphins will be back under water. i will end up with a photo of bubbles where dolphins WERE.This camera DOES have great color and sharp imaging.

As an advanced amateur (I'd also done some pro wedding work 25 yrs ago) I'm pretty demanding about cameras. My son wanted a small shirt pocket camera to take along with him, but to me these are one-trick ponies that only frustrate you as you get familiar with pictures and want to do something beyond mere snapshots. That's where my son is at right now, so I wanted a camera that would do that well, and offer intermediate controls to grow into. Here's why I chose this camera:* Excellent size/feel of camera in hand. This is very important to me, that the controls and feel/weight of the camera is good. This had a good \"feel\" to it, and the controls are logically laid out and easy to find even without looking.* 5 megapixel translates to a good 11x14 photo, and the ability to crop and print large photos (5x7, 8x10)* Comprehensive range of automatic picture modes- including settings for beach, snow, foliage, underwater, indoor, night snapshot, fireworks, kids and pets- that you usually can't find on most cameras. Helpful for the beginner to get a good shot with minimum muss and fuss* Easy to find AA batteries. I bought a set of 2500 mAh NiMHs that should last longer than regular alkalines (which can be found in a pinch anywhere worldwide).* Swiveling LCD viewfinder. Great for taking pictures overhead or waist level, even self-portraits. The added benefit, you can turn the screen toward the body so it doesn't scratch when carried.* Intermediate controls allow you to to manual, aperture or shutter priority, and program in addition to the automatic. White balance can be customized for better color control (crucial if you can't shoot in RAW).* While start-up isn't particularly fast (2 sec), you can shoot continuously at 1.5-2 frames per second for as long as you have space on your card* 38-114 (35mm equivalent) good for most photos, although a 28 mm wide angle would be much better. Given the mild barrel distortion at 38mm though, I think compromises were made to keep this package affordable.* AF illuminator. This is crucial when focusing in low light situations, and is not available in all cameras.* Optional adapters for wide or telephoto, and filter capability. Again, an intermediate plus.Trade-offs:* Only USB 1.1, slow downloading from camera to computer (though easily remedied with 2.0 flash card reader* LCD only 1.8\". While bigger than the 1.5\" on the A80, even small cameras are now using 2\" or larger screens* No RAW or TIFF mode, but cameras that have that capability are not generally classified as beginner or 'point-and-shoot'.* Pictures noisy at higher ISO speeds. Not uncommon problem, and unless a photo is enlarged a lot, isn't generally noticeable. Isn't a problem for me because I use Photoshop with a noise reduction plug-in to edit pictures. Easy to show my son how to do that.* Lack of a flash shoe for a true flash unit. This shouldn't be a problem for most snapshots though, and a flash unit would be awkward on a camera this small.* Slow and short video (can't shoot 30 fps, time limited to 15-30 sec). I don't use it often, but it's nice to have.I didn't find the CF door troublesome like some people did. There is a definite way to open and shut it, and when it's done properly, it clicks into place easily. The build quality is excellent, and I think this camera will last a few years and give good service. It's a good value for the price.

Auto power shut-off disable: You can set the camera so that it doesn't automatically go to sleep when you haven't taken a picture for a few minutes.

On 7/6/05, I purchased the Canon PowerShot A95, and a 1 GB SanDisk compact flash (CF) memory card for this purpose.  The trip went well and I took lots of photos with the intent of sorting them, and deleting any duplicates once I arrived home and downloaded them to my home PC.  However, that is where the problem occurred.  I can view all the pictures on the camera LCD screen, but the camera and/or the software will not allow me to download/view the pictures on a computer via the USB port.  The camera gets to the point where the download/transfer should start, and then powers off.  Then, I then get an error message that \"there are no images in the camera or camera folder\".  I have tried using the canon supplied software and connecting the camera to two Windows 98 computers and one Windows XP computer - same results.  I talked to the Canon technicians twice while trying this connection on the Windows 98 computers.  One technical guess was that since the camera uses a FAT32 indexing system and Windows 98 uses a FAT16 system, this could be the problem.  Wrong!  Window 98 uses the same FAT32 system that the camera uses.  I tried putting an 128MB SanDisk card in the camera that I had at home, taking 5 test pictures, and they transferred to the PC without a problem.The final results of my hours of trying to get the pictures from the camera to the computer:the Canon technician finally came to the conclusion that there must be an upper limit on the number of pictures that the camera/software can transfer to the computer (undocumented in the owners manual, of course).  Maybe this is why Canon only supplies a 32 MB card with the camera?  According to the technician, I would need to buy an external CF card reader to use in transferring the pictures to the PC from the CF card in the camera.  I just ordered the \"SanDisk ImageMate 12-in-1 USB 2.0 Hi-speed Reader ( SDDR-89-A15 )\", and will try this to retrieve my pictures from the CF card when it arrives.  There was no offer from the Canon technicians that I could return the camera and get it \"fixed\".From what I can currently see on the LCD screen, the camera appears to take good pictures.  However, if you are planning to use the PowerShot A95 (or other Canon camera models?) for pictures during a long vacation, you might consider buying an external card reader along with the camera.  Because of this problem, I gave the camera a 3 star rating.UPDATE:I have now had the camera for over a year.  The picture quality has, overall, been very good.  One 'bug' that I have noted is that when the camera is set to put a date and time at the bottom right corner of the picture, it works fine in the horizontal mode.  However, the camera does not recognize (for a number of seconds) when it has been turned for a vertical picture.  This results in many of my vertical shots having a date/time stamp along the upper right vertical edge of the photo.  The camera has a sensor (similar to a weighted pendulum) that moves when the camera is tilted 90 degrees for a vertical photo.  Mine apparently sticks and stays in the horizontal position, so the camera does not realize a vertical photo is being taken.  My work-around has been to turn the camera for the vertical shot, then tap it a couple of times with my fingers to get the \"pendulum\" to drop to the correct position for recognizing that a vertical photo is being taken.  The problem with the work-around is that many times, one forgets to do this; and if a passing stranger is taking a picture of you and a group of friends, you always have to tell them to \"tap the camera\" when they tilt it for a vertical photo.  I have not contacted Canon about this, but it should not have been a problem if they had used adequate quality controls/inspections during the production of this camera.", "Date": "September 18, 2005"}, {"Title": "Great  camera", "Author": "Nick Leshkiv \"cam expert\"", "ReviewID": "R2KB2446OQ6CDK", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Would be nice if the screeen was bigger and the camera was smaller", "Date": "July 20, 2005"}, {"Title": "Was good while it worked but pretty short life", "Author": "Amazon Customer", "ReviewID": "R3CNA4TPJC2FW4", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "This was a pretty good camera while it worked, for about 2.5 years.
