{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Canon 70d", "Author": "Yellowjacket", "ReviewID": "R3SSGZ4FTM395F", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This is a cool camera with an amazing capabilities.The two lenses that come with it are pretty good and cover a wide range from wide field to moderate telephoto.  The little tripod is kind of a joke.  The cleaning kit is fine if you don't already have one.  The included memory chip is fast.  Since the kit lenses have different objective adapter ring sizes it comes with the appropriate haze filters which are always my first purchase after getting a new camera/lens.  If for no other reason than to protect the front of my expensive lens.  The included software is good enough to get you going, but definitely is not Photoshop.  Comes with two batteries.  (One Canon, one aftermarket) both work well so far.  the bag is Okay, but I seldom use bags so it will likely gather dust on my shelf.", "Date": "December 20, 2013"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": "$1,699.00", "Features": "EOS 70D 20.2 MP CMOS Digital SLR Camera and EF-S 18-135mm F3.5-5.6 IS STM Kit\n32GB Secure Digital SD Memory Card, EF-S 55-250mm f/4-5.6 IS II (Stabilized) Telephoto Lens\n58mm and 67mm Multicoated UV Protective Filters, LP-E6 Battery for Canon EOS Cameras\nBattery Charger for Canon LP-E6 Battery, Compact Deluxe Gadget Bag, Hi-Speed SD USB 2.0 Card Reader\nFlexible Mini Table-Top Tripod, 3 Pack LCD Screen Protectors, 3pc.
