{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Happy so far.  Compared to Olympus Pen Mini E-PM1", "Author": "SmartShopper \"SmartShopper\"", "ReviewID": "RIJ5CLXI6OZH9", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Forgot to check Amazon reviews before buying this, but glad I didn't because the camera is quite good for my needs and I might not have bought it based on the mixed and sparse reviews on Amazon.  I did look at \"professional\" reviews on photographyblog and dpreview, which were much more positive.I was deciding between the new Olympus Pen Mini E-PM1, Sony NEX C3, and GF3.  Tried out the Olympus and GF3, and decided on the GF3.  I got a better price on the GF3 than I could for the Pen Mini, but that was just icing on the cake, because the features on the GF3 meet my needs better.Similarities between GF3 and E-PM1:--body size about the same--similar price range--Micro Four-Thirds sensor--both are the budget, easy-to-use version of their respective camera families--instant-record movie button--kit zoom lens 14-42mm--neckstrap--to my layman eyes the photo quality was about the same, as was auto-focus speed, though E-PM1 is billed as having the fastest auto-focus in this category.The features that put the GF3 over the top for me:--Price.  I got a great deal on the GF3.  Sony was just too expensive, though I've read great things about photo quality--GF3 touchscreen, while not very responsive (resistive screen you have to press down on, rather than capacitive screen like iPhone), is very useful for quick adjustments.  It just makes the camera easier to use, much like an iPad is easier to use than a laptop.  Deleting batches of photos is much easier than using buttons.  So is scrolling around a photo you're reviewing in close-up.  You can also touch to change the subject of focus, like on an iPhone.--Flash is built in--not so on the Pen Mini or NEX.  I'm not an \"enthusiast\" and have no intention of ever buying an external flash or viewfinder, so lack of a hotshoe was not an issue.  Flash can also be tilted up to the ceiling (with some finger dexterity) to do a bounce-flash that brightens up indoor photos without that nasty flash look.  Other 2 cameras come with a small add-on flash, but that's just too much trouble.--I like the physical on-off switch rather than the Pen Mini's button--Menus and options were slightly more intuitive, though I admit my previous camera was a Panasonic as well, so I may be used to their menus.--In addition to dedicated movie button, there's a dedicated \"iA\" full-auto button, which my wife can press to go to full-auto mode without digging into menus (it lights up).--Big lens cap seems easier to handle.--Comes with lens hood, which I might not use but is nice to be included.--Battery charger is a one-piece mini brick with prongs built in, making it very portable.  E-PM1 comes with a brick with power cord attachment.I can't speak to other reviewers' issues with the pancake lens (since I don't have it) nor the flash durability (since I've only had the camera a week).About the Pen Mini:--Body is about the same size as the GF3, but the kit zoom lens is smaller (shorter and narrower)--Stabilization is in the body, not the lens like GF3.  From what I read this is supposed to be an advantage, but I think it was adding noises to the videos I took (turning off stabilization stopped the noises).  I haven't noticed similar noises in GF3 videos with stabilization on.--Lock on the lens to close it (but not open it) started to get annoying quickly.--Flash was impressive--power is adjustable, and I think it auto-adjusts based on subject distance.  From what I can see of the GF3, it fires full-power all the time, which can make photos look washed out.  Fortunately the bounce-flash trick mentioned above avoids that problem.--Neck strap attachment loops are hinged and tends to kind of make click-clack noises when handling the camera.About me:  my main photo subject is my 2 yr old daughter, so I was looking for a camera that would focus quickly, take decent pics in indoor light without flash, and still be small enough to throw in the diaper bag with room to spare for, well, diapers and stuff.  These criteria rule out bulky SLRs, and most point-and-shoots.  For my daughter's first 2 years I had the Panasonic LX-3, a \"high-end point-and-shoot\".  The LX-3 produces great pics in good light, and decent pics in low light, but I find the focus is too slow (esp. in low light) now that my daughter is moving around (a LOT).Long review and naturally biased toward the GF3, but I hope it helps your decision process!", "Date": "December 3, 2011"}, {"Title": "Great option for point and shoot upgraders who are willing to invest into the system", "Author": "Mebpenguin", "ReviewID": "R22NLHDOGDE7LB", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I think how you feel about this camera is really going to depend on where you're coming from. If you're a DSLR shooter and are looking for a portable body you're likely going to be frustrated by the lack of control points on this camera.On the other hand, for those upgrading from a point and shoot camera like myself, this camera can be ideal. I came from a Canon S90, which I purchased a couple of years ago looking for a camera that does a better job in low light than the typical point and shoot. The S95 was definitely a step up from what I had before, but more recently I've become frustrated with the limitations of the sensor and was also interested in exploring the world of interchangeable lenses.What I didn't want, however, was to get a full DSLR. Portability is extremely important to me, any camera that can't be slipped into a coat pocket or small bag is simply useless to me. No, the GF3 can't fit into a pants pocket like my S95 did, but it's still massively smaller than even the smallest DSLRs and it's amongst the smallest models in the mirrorless camera class.With small size taken care of, the next question is how good is the image quality? If you're stepping up from a high-end point and shoot like I am you're probably not going to notice a major difference in good lighting conditions, but where the GF3 blows my old S95 away is in low light situations. This performance does come with a caveat, however, which is that you need the right lens on the camera in order to get the low light performance you want. If you are not going to buy any additional lenses beyond the kit you're not going to see any benefit over a high end point and shoot and you should probably consider one of those cameras (Canon S100, Olympus XZ-1, Fuji X100).In my case I was happy to go out and purchase the 20mm f/1.7 Panasonic lens for low light photography. This lens allows me shoot at shutter speeds ranging from 1/40 to 1/100 of a second in very low light situations, at ISOs that would have ended up unacceptably grainy on my S90 (1600 or 3200). The result is that I'm getting indoor shots of pets and kids that I simply wasn't able to get before.Now, some people coming from a pro level camera will probably tell you that I'm crazy to shoot at ISO 3200 with this camera, but if you're coming from a point and shoot you'll find the noise so much better that it will be hard to notice. Yes there is a slight grain to shots, but it's very fine and if all you're doing is sharing photos on Facebook or via email it's barely noticeable. I wouldn't push it to 6400 ISO, however.What about controls? In my case I find that the combination of the four-way controller, rotating dial and touch screen give me all the control points I want or need. I've got the FN button assigned to ISO control, and access Metering, Image Size and Flash controls via the touch screen Quick Menu, which can be customized to include a wide variety of controls. The four-way controller then gives me access to all the other controls I want: drive mode, white balance, focus point and exposure compensation. I shoot mostly in Program or Aperture Priority mode and am very happy with how quickly I can adjust my settings.So, bottom line, if you're upgrading from a point and shoot and are willing to take advantage of the fact that this is an interchangeable lens camera to buy the lens(es) that fit your needs, this can be a great upgrade camera for point and shooters. Don't forget that the real long-term investment is in the lenses, you can always upgrade to a better body in the future and continue to use whichever great lenses you purchase on those future bodies, one of the great features of a camera system like this.", "Date": "December 28, 2011"}, {"Title": "No regrets.  This camera is sexy.", "Author": "Desmond", "ReviewID": "R1P7BA8AD4MGC3", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I got this kit about a week ago at Target.  It was a deal I couldn't pass up: $400 with a free $75 Target gift card.  I'd been obsessively researching system cameras for a few months, and I thought I had narrowed it down to either the Canon T2i or the Nikon D3100.  I wanted something that could do full HD as well as sophisticated focus pulling.  I was pretty sure I wanted something that could shoot at 24 fps, but this deal got me rethinking that.  The more I read, the more I realized that you don't really need 24 fps to get that film look, that there are other factors that go into profession looking shots.  I wanted to be able to achieve the rack focus effect of pulling the focus from the background to the foreground or between different subjects in the frame.  With the touchscreen and the crazy-fast autofocus on the GF3, all you have to do is point where you want to focus.  It makes it so simple, and if you want more controll, you can still focus manually.  The mic is mono, but I decided I could live with that because I can alway use an external recorder and microphone and add the audio track to the clips later, which would lead to better sound anyway.  The lack of viewfinder option is a little disappointing, but I'm over it.  I may eventually get a third party LCD viewfinder for shooting in sunlight.I had no trouble importing clips to Corel Videostudio and editing them.", "Date": "December 3, 2011"}, {"Title": "Panasonic Lumix DMC-GF3 Micro Four Thirds w 14-42 lens Update", "Author": "li'l bamboo", "ReviewID": "R3MRWCBHS3VTDW", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "I am not a pro photographer.  I don't usually make money off of my photos but I like good photos. I am mainly a very enthusiastic amateur portrait photographer. Anything that gets in front of my camera is fair game so.The camera:I bought this camera to fit a specific niche. I'm not looking to retire my DSLR.  I don't want a bunch of lenses for this camera.  I have all Pro Glass for my DSLR. I'm not going to shoot any production videos with this camera as my DSLR shoots also video.  The niche was for me to have available a camera that is smaller and lighter than my DSLR with nearly the same range coverage. During a trip to Europe a few years ago I realized that nearly half of the several thousand photos I took were with my P&S.; I realized in some situations a smaller camera can be advantageous. I've seen these micro four thirds in action and I liked the idea of being able to shoot RAW instead of JPEG.  This is a personal preference. I didn't buy this camera to replace my DSLR. For me it is a walk around / scout camera. The size and weight advantage this camera are evident at 17 ounces it beats carrying my 5 pound DSLR.  I also got a 45-200 lens to go along with my 'kit' so at somewhere just over 2.5 pounds I have nearly as much range as 30 pounds of DSLR and three lenses with flash.I like the fact that I'm able to 'set up' the different modes to my liking.  I tend to use more sharpness to my photos and I have that ability with this camera.dislikes out of the box: This is the second Panasonic camera that I have. Both of them have this really flimsy battery/card access door.  There is no question that anywhere near water this could be a problem. There was also a noticeable gap along the bottom where the two halves of the body joined.Overall I like the camera's size.  It is a little awkward feeling in the beginning simply because of the lens being nearly as big as the camera. This awkwardness quickly goes away.  For me out of the box the camera is pretty simple to operate.  The small pamphlet type of instructions are mainly people who don't know about cameras to get the pieces of the camera to fit together.  If you are familiar with cameras then it really isn't very useful.  The instruction manual is on a disc.  I'd prefer a real manual as I tend to carry my camera manuals in my camera bag or a cheat sheet.I've had this camera for about a month.  I've done a few different 'events' with it.  The first night I had it I took it to my photo club meet and took photos indoors shooting at ISO 1600. The results of those photos weren't bad.  A little more noise in the darker areas of the room but that is to be expected at higher ISOs. I experimented with the Auto ISO and found that it wasn't as intuitive as I like.  I tried a couple shots with the AI mode and figured that didn't work for me. I experimented with ISO 3200 in a restaurant party room and found that there was way to much noise for my liking.I've taken close to 500 photos with this camera in a month. In most situations this camera is really nice to have around. I did take it along on a photo club outing and I gotta tell you that in direct sunlight was a major fail.  Nearly all of those helpful screen aids become nearly impossible to see.The LED screen has many features and I like them for the most part.  The touch screen is really nice. The menu selection isn't as intuitive as I'd like, but I typically tend to not change settings all that often during a shoot. I tend to run several of the 'accessory' style features like the histogram, display and grid. These seem to use a lot of battery power.  I spent nearly twelve hours on a short road trip with this camera taking nearly a hundred photos and by the time I got home I had two bars on the battery.  Not great but then again with all the extra stuff on the LED going too it really isn't all that bad. I typically like to leave my cameras on when I'm walking around.  I turned this camera on and off during the long day.  I worked around the bright sunlight and when I was out of the direct sun the camera functioned very well.I tried to use the editing program that came with the camera. I have already several editing programs and really didn't need this program taking space on my computer.  Part of the reason I don't use this camera's editing program is that the first time you open the program it will attempt to catalog every photo on your computer and external drive.  As I have several thousand photos on my external drive this takes a very long time.  I just modified my work flow a bit as the Panasonic RAW files apparently covered by my version of Photo Shop, but are in Lightroom.  So instead of having the program automatically download the new photos into their own folder I create it and cut and paste them.  I've noticed that the Panasonic movie files don't transfer automatically.  You need to move them yourself.Conclusion:The camera fits pretty well the niche I wanted it to fill. There really isn't a macro capability with this camera unless you get a macro lens.  I'm pretty much back to using my P&S; for that.  There are times when a macro lens is handy.  The camera has a macro selection but that tends to be more of a bokeh style function than macro.The camera strap is to short and the small nature of the body means that finding something longer might be an issue unless you come up with a hack. A couple of small key ring holders would work to put a longer strap on. The battery life is a little short especially if you are using the 45-200 lens with the IS switch.The camera won't fit in your pocket if you don't have a pancake lens on it.  You'll need a bag.  I have a small military surplus bag that I carry the camera in.  I don't so much like the idea of a wrist strap as they aren't all that practical for me.If you are looking for a nice camera that takes good quality photos, is easy to operate and yet has DSLR capabilities then this is a camera worth taking a look.2012_07_17 Update:I've had this camera combo for several weeks and have taken close to 500 photos with it. I believe the newness has finally worn off and while I like the camera still I am disappointed with its overall performance photo wise.  I've been shooting photos with this camera in low light situations and at sunrise.  I'm finding that the noise level at 400 ISO isn't what I think it should be.  Then again I'm use to a Canon 5Dmkii and have no issues with using 1600 ISO with that camera.  The grain is very noticeable @ 400 ISO with the Panasonic even about a half hour after sunrise. It is hard to get a tack sharp photo with the telephoto lens extended partially out.  I don't think it should be an issue at ISO 800 but apparently with this camera the noise is terrible.  Even with the IS function it is very difficult to get a hand held shot.  I think there is room for improvement with the technology.  I've lowered my rating of this camera to 3 stars because I'm having lots of difficulty taking photos with this camera during the time I normally take photos which is low light and sunrise.  I also find the menus a bit cumbersome and non intuitive.It can take a decent portrait shot when there is nice available light.  So if this is when you take most of your photos then this is a terrific camera.  I like the weight and its potential reach with the long lens.  I think there needs to be more improvement.  I can say it is a good camera.  Would I recommend it? I think yes with the caveat of if you are using it for fun photos it is a good camera.  If you are looking to entry level DSLR quality this probably isn't the best example.", "Date": "July 12, 2012"}, {"Title": "Nice camera, but didn't focus well with pancake lens", "Author": "Brad S", "ReviewID": "R4HFJU4HIMXFN", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "I own the older version of this camera (GF1) and was looking for something smaller to capitalize on the compactness of the micro 4/3 system. The GF3 is significantly smaller than the GF1, small enough that I could carry it in my jeans pocket with only a slight bulge (the old camera wouldn't fit at all!).The camera is a 'downgrade' functionality wise because it loses the mode dial, hotshoe and real jog dial of its ancestor but nevertheless functions just as well in terms of operation and speed.Problem is I had a 20mm f1.7 pancake lens with my GF1 and focusing was very erratic on the GF3. Electric contacts were clean on both the camera and lens but focusing is a 'hit or miss' beyond acceptable levels. Focusing was always sharp and accurate with the same lens on the old camera", "Date": "November 2, 2011"}, {"Title": "Tiny Body, Mighty Power", "Author": "Newt", "ReviewID": "R3TYV1SUCUFWDA", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "My husband and I recently bought this camera and were able to test it out in Washington DC for the Cherry Blossom Festival. We were upgrading from an old point and shoot and a couple of camera phones so neither of us has much real photography experience.We were instantly surprised with how easy the camera is to pick up and start snapping with. With the guts close to that of a DSLR but the size of a point and shoot, the camera is small enough to fit into a jacket pocket but mighty enough to get incredible detail (sorry camera phone... I don't think we can see each other anymore). I've read some complaints that with the longer lens the camera feels unbalanced, but the only time I ever noticed this was in between shots when the camera was hanging around my neck. In my hands it felt great.The camera did a beautiful job handling close up pictures of the individual blossoms as well as getting great shots of rows of trees. The auto-focus setting made the camera feel just like a point and shoot which made both of us instantly more comfortable playing around with some of the other settings. Looking at the photos on the computer we are thrilled with the quality of the shots and the depth of field that is produced. With little to no effort on our part the pictures came out with beautiful color and detail.The only negative we've found so far is that the battery life seems to leave a little to be desired. By the end of the day we were opting to turn the camera off in between shots to conserve power. We have since picked up another battery which quickly makes this a minor issue. Also in the camera's favor, even when we were shutting the camera completely off between shots, it only took a matter of seconds to get it turned back on and photo ready. Short of the rapid spontaneous shots, this camera should be able to boot back up in plenty of time should you need to save some juice.Over all this camera has exceeded our initial expectations and seems to be a great entry level camera for those toying with the idea of a DSLR. The price is great, and for those coming from a point and shoot, the results will knock you off your feet.", "Date": "March 29, 2012"}, {"Title": "Cute little camera but has an epic flaw", "Author": "Kevspins2", "ReviewID": "R3N0HTQO1VMUSG", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "The camera is adorable and truly does produce great photos.

I have since done some more shooting and the shadow created by the lens when using the flash has ruined way too many shots. This seems like a HUGE design oversight and I've decided to downgrade it to 3 - even with the deal I got on it. You would do better to spend $100-150 more and get a camera that is designed well - I did so and purchased the Sony NEX5 and am quite happy with it.Looking for an upgrade from a point and shoot I came across a this camera - reviewed fairly well and the idea of a better camera that was still somewhat more compact (and cheaper) than the higher end models was appealing. It has taken some good photos, and I am still learning the ins and outs of the options that allow for more flexibility in the kinds of photos I can take. Downsides - This option with the 14-42mm lens ends up not feeling all that compact. You have the option of getting other lenses which is nice, but expensive. And while the pop up flash is touted as a plus when compared to similar cameras, it doesn't pop up high enough to avoid a shadow created by the lens, at least when objects are relatively near. Conclusion, I feel like I'm going to outgrow this one pretty quick. However, having found an in store deal that ended up at $350 after tax, it was worth it.

Panasonic is one of the two companies producing m 4/3 cameras. The other one is Olympus. In the line-up of m 4/3 cameras from Panasonic, GF1/2/3 are relatively cheaper and meant for the people who want to upgrade from compact cameras. GF3 is an intent to attract that crowd even more aggressively with the features of compact cameras and without advanced features of typical DSLRs that this group of people may not care about. So I cannot say those missing features are the weakness of this camera. They are simply product design choices based on the target market. Here are things you may want to know in choosing this camera over other m 4/3 cameras.1. Body: It is probably the smallest m 4/3 or even mirrorless camera on the market. I like the convenience of it. But I do see a design problem for people used to compact cameras. Those people are used to holding a camera with left hand on the left edge of it. Unfortunately, the microphone is right on the top left side. You will be blocking it if you hold it that way. People use left hand on the lens to hold a DSLR. That is something you have to get used to. The manual does warn users on that.2. No hot shoe or viewfinder port: That means you won't be able to attach an external flash or a viewfinder. You are stuck with the built-in flash and LCD screen. These limitations may not be  problems for people who will never need those two accessories. The design of the built-flash is very smart. You can bend the pop-up flash to direct the light to the ceiling, for example, to get the indirect lighting on the subject to produce better flash pictures.3. Photo quality: Again don't expect GF3 to produce photo quality as good as top-of-the-line m 4/3 cameras like Panasonic GH2. ISO can go up to 6400 on GF3. But I would only go up to 800. Beyond that the images are too noisy to me. But for many people who won't print the photos larger than 8 x 10, the image quality is quite acceptable. Also you have to know, it has an old 12MP sensor, which is supposed to be not as good as the latest ones on higher-end cameras.4. Audio: No connection for external mic. Audio is mono not stereo.This is a relatively cheap m 4/3 camera. You simply have to know what you are getting and what you are not getting in choosing GF3. Then you will be very happy in your decision. While you are on it, you may also consider Olympus PEN E-PL1 12.3MP Live MOS Micro Four Thirds Interchangeable Lens Digital Camera with 14-42mm f/3.5-5.6 Zuiko Digital Zoom Lens (Black). It is the first generation Panasonic m 4/3 camera. It has the same sensor as GF3. Photo quality is comparable. Size is slightly bigger, but not much. It has a hot shoe and a viewefinder port. The biggest drawback is probably video. It is 720p instead of 1080p. And you can only record 7 min of video in 720p. But most importantly, it is about 200 hundred bucks cheaper! You can use that money to invest in a good fast prime lens like Panasonic LUMIX G 20mm f/1.7 Aspherical Pancake Lens for Micro Four Thirds Interchangeable Lens Cameras. It will make your camera really shine.update on 6/25/2012: With the release of GF5, the price of this camera has dropped considerably.

It pushes the GF series further towards the casual photographer and away from the enthusiasts at which ILCs were initially aimed.What that means in terms of specification is a body with the same sensor and LCD screen as its predecessor and the loss of some key features including the rear thumb push-wheel, hotshoe and accessory port, and the replacement of stereo mics with a mono one.This has been traded for a smaller lighter better-designed body with faster AF performance, new focussing modes, more versatile Photo Style customisation and Creative Control effects. It all adds up to a model that will have much broader appeal, particularly to those looking to trade up from an advanced compact.It won't be to everyone's liking though, particularly enthusiast photographers who care more about control than simplicity, but the writing has been on the wall for some time now.

Same goes true for low light situations.The flash works great. However, my one complaint is that the flash buttons easily pushed inside a bag. I kept finding the flash open side my backpack with a fear it had bent of broke. It didn't but I am researching a case for that reason.The touch screen works surprisingly well. It is sensitive and I don't find myself pushing hard like others had said. I didn't thinkiwouldusit, but I used it a lot. It is great for previewing and zooming in on your photos.Personally,I keep the camera in full auto mode. It has great manual features, but not what I need.I bought a bigger zoom lens and haven't even used it yet.

I wanted better lenses and the ability to instantly take photos, without the usual lag between pushing the button and taking the picture. This camera has super fast focus in most conditions, and allows you to take photos in low light conditions without using the flash. I was really trying to get a camera with a viewfinder, but found it was going to get me a bigger camera and cost a lot more. The screen on the back is large enough and can be made bright enough in sunny conditions to be able to use it instead of a viewfinder. Besides, being able to edit photos afterwards on the computer helps make up for a picture that may not be perfectly framed. I couldn't pass up the special one day pricing that was offered through Amazon, and I was glad I didn't.I am pretty geeky and comfortable with electronics and even downloaded and read the basic instruction manual before I received the camera. I also watched videos on YouTube produced by Panasonic, which really helped me to get a grasp of the main features of this particular model. The controls on the back are simple, like a point and shoot, so I felt at home. This camera can do a lot, and there are a lot of menus you go through in the screen to make some settings. However, if you want to let the camera do most of the work, it will take great photos.I took this camera on a trip to Berlin Germany recently. Most days were overcast so I had good even light. I loved having the ability to brighten up the pictures and change the color balance to a redder tone very quickly and easily in Auto+ mode. It made the pictures warmer. I also liked the ability to zoom in and crop certain photos within the camera. With the lens that was part of the kit, 14-42mm, it was not too large to carry around with me. If you just used the 14mm lens, you could easily slip it into a coat pocket.I took a few videos that came out very well, with good sound, but that was not the main reason for buying this camera.Overall, I am pleased with my decision.

I also ordered a SONY NEX-C3 and i am going to compare and probably send one back. I haven't received that one yet and will update when i get that one.Just some quick comments i will say are that the camera is pretty compact and solid feeling once you put the battery in the compartment. My only big issue so far is on how to hold it. I am extremely afraid I am going to drop this thing due to the the lack of a grip on the camera when you hold it. I find myself trying to position my hands correctly as to not block the speaker (only for video) or to get out of the way of the flash. It is tempting to grab hold of the lens as you carry it, you almost have to because its the only stable part of the camera for positioning your hand. But I can get use to this, I don't have large hands unfortunately (please no Freudian thoughts here) and it is still a bit tough to comfortably hold it.The one thing about this camera that I can't emphasize enough and is probably why i will keep this camera regardless is the flash. To have the option of holding back the flash so you can bounce light off the ceiling or whatever changes the whole quality of the picture. It's like night and day literally. The flash when pointed directly at a subject seems to whiten out or decrease the vividness of the picture. I mean the picture is good either way but when you compare the both of them it is such a difference. This feature should be on every camera and in my opinion was worth everything i paid for it due to the quality of pictures. I will update as I go along and give this rating a 4 star until i work through some more testing.As far as video I am still doing some filming with 1080i AVCHD and so far so good.ProsFLASH - OMG this rocksvery sexy good looking cameraon/off buttonoptions ofr more lensestouch screenConsHard to hold comfortably - if you have big hands look out.UPDATE:  11/4/2012Been playing with this camera some more and I reallly enjoy using it.

Because the price on this is so cheap these days, I figure someone might be looking at how this compares to the newer equipment out there.I'm fully satisfied with the GF3 over the past 2 years. It was my first camera that was not a point-and-shoot camera, and this one really let me learn about how to take control over my photos (although I'm far from a pro). The body build is fantastic and for a beginner shooter the button layout is great. It's pretty simple to use overall, especially for those of us who'll mostly just leave it in Aperature mode :).To really get the most out of this camera though, I'd really recommend pairing it with the 14mm f2.8 lens or the Panasonic 20mm f1.7 lens (who wouldn't recommend this lens though!). If you don't think you want to make the investment in other lenses, I'm not convinced the 14-42mm kit lens made this camera that much better than even say Canon S95/S100/S110 and certainly not the Sony RX100.I previously considered upgrading to the NEX-3N or the Canon EOS-M w/ 22mm lens, but stuck with this one until the price on the E-PM2 came down. The focus speed on the GF3 was faster than the NEX and significantly faster than the EOS-M (even with the new firmware), and the lens sizes for the GF3 were a decent amount smaller than the Sony NEX series. The GF3 suffered greatly in low-light shots compared to the other ones of course due to the sensor (although the bounceable flash on the GF3 does help it out a bit). However if you're trying to keep up with moving kids in decent lighting, the GF3 is the winner of these 3 here as long as you have at least the 14mm lens.Compared to the E-PM2, I actually liked the body build of the GF3 better, the metal alloy on the GF3 seems more metallic than the metal alloy of the E-PM2. But the newer sensor on the E-PM2 is significantly better than the GF3's, especially in low-light.One note of the GF3: when I viewed the JPGs with default Windows 7 photo viewer, for whatever reason the contrast is terrible and makes the photos look really bad (especially low light photos). So don't use Windows 7 photo viewer with this camera, or you may think the pictures this camera takes are much worse when they're actually pretty good!", "Date": "December 10, 2013"}, {"Title": "Great value", "Author": "Eric D.

When you compare it to P&S; it is much better. (several times bigger).Please note that sensors will improve exponentially - like all electronics - and in a couple of years any tiny sensor will beat any current FF, that is one of the reasons to move to 4/3, is is the smallest possible size that your hands can correctly handle.Glass (lenses) available for this camera are pretty decent and growing fast,  premium glass from Oly and Panny (with the aid of Leica) are really becoming professional, please note that panasonic also makes professional video cameeras.This camera is for people who wants to try the 4/3 format and \"grow\" with it, you can add 20+lenses and - as usual - results will improve as you add prime glass.I \"started\" with the lens kit, then added the 20mm and 45mm macro, these are my results GF3 +:Kit lens is pretty decent, but lacks of light and is too big for pocket use, I use it less and less, like the fast focus.20 mm is excellent, it's a journal lens, I love it because the size is pretty small and IQ is great, in combination with GF3 it makes a take-everywere. I wont recommend it for moving subjects.45 mm has the best IQ of these three, it is very fast focus and usefull as a limited telephoto, portrait and video lens.7-14 WA has great quality for Landscape, Architecture and again video.If you are heavily invested in DSRL and don't mind the size and weight, don't buy GF3, on the other hand if you plan to keep shooting and like to carry your camera everywere, I am sure you will enjoy GF3 and will eventyally add to make this your \"all\" system.", "Date": "March 14, 2013"}, {"Title": "Great for what it is", "Author": "Kevin M. Martin", "ReviewID": "RD53HPHZDKMVD", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This camera is a hard one to objectively review.  After all, it was a successor to a much beloved camera that just couldn't live up to its predecessor.  In that regard it reminds me of the Coolpix 995 vs the 990- even though the 995 offered some improvements it took away some much desired features (ie: full metal body) in the process.  The result was a camera that was disliked enough that for a time used 990s would fetch higher prices on ebay than new 995s.The same is true for this camera.  Where the GF1 was a groundbreaking rangefinder style camera with all the bells and whistles and the GF2 was a clear extension of that philosophy, the GF3 took a different path entirely.  In place of the multiple command dials, nearly all control functions are accessed by a touch-screen interface.  The styling steered away from the more serious boxy shape of its predecessor into a more fluid and \"point n shoot\" form.  Probably most controversially though was the omission of the hot-shoe.  Without this feature, external flashes and EVFs cannot be attached, making this in the eyes of the GF-series users a definite step down.Having said that, this camera was my first foray into the Micro Four-thirds format.  Coming from a series of Canon DSLRs (Rebel 300D, 30D and now a 50D) I am well used to changing lenses and carrying around the gear.  Over the years, I have gravitated more towards fast primes and away from zooms and generally ended up using a \"fast normal\" (Sigma 30mm 1.4) for most of my shooting.  I managed to get the GF3 cheap as a kit with the (ok) 14-42 zoom from Target and had originally intended it as a light-weight travel camera for unimportant outings (mostly bicycling).  However, once I started using it I came to realize that the GF3 exemplifies what it is that Micro-four thirds is trying to accomplish:  Provide a small, lightweight system that can (almost) match an SLR.  What I didn't realize then was that the useability advantages of this system actually allowed me to get better shots than I typically could with the SLR!Handling:The GF3 is an incredibly lightweight and compact camera for its image quality.  Unfortunately, Panasonic didn't do it any favors by shipping this with the bulky and mediocre 14-42 zoom, as this both kills it's size advantages and cannot truely demonstrate what this camera can do.  The touch-screen is well implemented and has virtually all of the features that my \"serious\" 50D has, but is far easier to access and use.  Menu usage and mode changes are fast and intuitive, and in use I find it takes me less time to get the shot than it did with the SLR.  In this regard, it has brought me back to a more spontaneous \"just shoot\" time that I had when using my old Coolpix 950.Autofocus:Focusing is fast and accurate, utilizing an excellent contrast-detection autofocus system.  Manual focus is also much easier to use since you now have the ability to zoom in and confirm your focus points with great accuracy. In my use, I have found that for still subjects, the contrast detection autofocus is more accurate than my 50D in most cases- the only exception being in very low light.  For moving subjects, however, you will have a hard time using it since contrast detection systems cannot track with any real accuracy (they cannot determine distance the way an SLR's phase detection system can).  This was not an issue for me, since virtually all my photography is landscape, nature and portraits (not sports).Image Quality:Probably the biggest advantage of the micro-four thirds system over other mirrorless systems on the market today is the excellent selection of prime lenses available.  Once I picked up my first serious lens (the beautiful Panasonic 25mm 1.4), the results were simply amazing.  Whatever limitations this camera's sensor might have against my 50D were more than overcome by the substantially better optical performance of this lens.  While the 50D had about a stop and a half of light advantage (a shot at ISO 400 on the 50D has about the same noise as one shot at ISO 160 on the GF3), the Panasonic 25mm is so sharp that it will out-resolve the Sigma 30mm 1.4 set at 2.8 while at wide open (giving it a two stop advantage).  That- plus having a much more accurate and reliable contrast-detect autofocus- meant that for the first time I had a truely fast normal lens that I wouldn't hesitate to use wide open.  The result is that in practice I simply got better pictures out of the GF3 than out of my 50D (and didn't break my back lugging that weight around).  Since then I have added the Olympus 12mm f2 and have not touched my 50D since.In summary, if you are looking for a camera with alot of bells and whistles, there are a number of excellent choices in the micro-four thirds arena (including the GF1/2's true successor- the GX1).  However, if you are looking for a capable system camera to get you back to pure shooting, get this body and use the money saved to get a serious lens (the aforementioned 25mm f1.4 or the 20mm f1.7).  You may be surprised at how it changes how you shoot.", "Date": "January 14, 2013"}, {"Title": "Awesome!

So far, I'm extremely happy with it!I'm an artist , and I sometimes do semi-serious photography projects as sort of a side thing. I have my good (film) SLR that I've been using, but I wanted something smaller, lighter, and more viable for everyday usage. I also don't really care about flash or about video, so those features weren't a concern for me. Manual settings were important for me, however, and even though this camera is supposedly being marketed towards point and shoot converts, I am still very happy with the manual control you can get. The manual mode is pretty straightforward, and there are also aperture and shutter speed priority modes. The manual focus is also really nice, and the picture-in-picture thing on the display makes it really easy to use.I only have a few complaints. In bright sunlight, the display is kind of hard to see, and I find that I have to awkwardly shade it with one hand while I take the picture. In addition, I am also a little disappointed by the (slight) awkward appearance of this camera with the 14-42 mm zoom lens. It isn't as small as you'd think (but still probably small enough to fit into your bag). I bought this camera only with this lens, and it seems to me that the camera must've been intended to be purchased with the zoom and the pancake lens as a set. Like other people said, the zoom lens here also produces a shadow when you're using the flash at close distance.Anyway, I would recommend this camera to people like me, and to anyone else who wants a small(ish) good quality camera for everyday use.

Dallas", "ReviewID": "RLZRE7PHZ10KQ", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "The Lumix GF3 is the light-weight hybrid still-image and video camera offered by Panasonic that still offers a solid punch!  It is the third iteration of the GF models.  Panasonic also offers the fourth GF iteration named the GF5 with a larger rubber handgrip, skipping the number GH\"4\" (the number 4 is considered an undesirable number in some Asian cultures).  Currently there are four Lumix model series:  the entry-level GF models, the mid-level G series models, the GX1 model, and the high-end GH models.  All of these Lumix models, including the GF3, are based on the DSLM (Digital Single Lens Mirrorless) technology using the Micro Four Thirds 4:3 image aspect ratio standard created by Panasonic and Olympus.  For the Amazon shoppers that are new to the DSLM world, compared to the DSLR (Digital Single Lens Reflex) cameras, the DSLM cameras are significantly lighter (bodies and lenses), are better tailored to video shooting, and arguably are a better value for hybrid shooting compared to DSLR.  If you are still unsure then I highly recommend going to YouTube and search DSLM versus DSLR as well as the Lumix GF3.The GF3 is a major step-up from the typical point-and-shoot cameras due to the relatively larger sensor size, the options available to take control of how to shoot still-images, and the ability to take nice HD quality 1920x1080 30p videos.  In addition, there are at least 17 Lumix Micro Four Thirds lenses to choose from for the GF3.  Note that all these Lumix lenses may be used on the other Lumix G series cameras.  For instance, I currently own a few Lumix products including the GH2, the GX1, and the GF3 plus six Lumix lenses: 14-42 kit, 14 pancake, 20 pancake, 25 Summilux, 14-42 GX, and the 45-175 GX.  All the lenses work well with my GF3.  The GF3 is a nice addition to my Lumix system set-up.Due to its light weight and intuitive touch screen, I often use my GF3 along with the ultra light 14mm lens when I need a nice camera to throw in my jacket pocket (while not able to fit into most blue jean pockets it is still easy enough to tote around).  As a point of reference, the body including SD card and batteries for the GF3, GX1, and GH2 are approximately 9.31 ounces, 11.22 ounces, and 15.66 ounces, respectively.  Even with it's light weight, the GF3 can still shot 12.1Mb pictures as well as very respectable 1920x1080 30p HD videos at up to 17Mbps!  However, for those shoppers that might want the ability to have an Electronic View Finder, the one thing that is missing from the GF3 is a hot-shoe to add-on an EVF.  While the GX1 does have a hot-shoe for an EVF option, the GX1 costs more than the GF3 since it is targeted towards shooters that desire more manual controls, camera dial, and a higher end image sensor.In summary, I recommend the Lumix GF3 which sports a very good 3 inch 460,000 dots Live View touch screen system, a Venus Engine FHD core processor, as well as a built-in pop up flash.  It is especially recommended if your preference is for a small hybrid DSLM camera without the need for an Electronic View Finder.  At approximately 9.31 ounces (body including SD card and battery) the light-weight GF3 still packs a solid punch.", "Date": "December 26, 2012"}, {"Title": "great for novice wanting great pics", "Author": "bc", "ReviewID": "R3TDRNU308W6VY", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I'll leave the technical reviews and why this camera is technically good or not to others.

What I can tell you is if you're looking for something that's comfortably situated between a point-and-shoot and a full size DSLR, this is the way to go. Best of all, this camera can be had at very competitive prices compared to other micro 4/3 cameras.This camera is fast: I'm able to take great pictures of my 3 year old daughter and that takes some doing, believe me.This camera is sexy: It's got a svelte form factor and looks absolutely tiny next to a full DSLR.This camera is easy to use: once you play around with it for a while, it's quite easy to navigate. There's an \"iA\" button which puts it in full automatic mode, though I wouldn't recommend it... just learn how to do some basic functions and you'll be taking some high quality snaps that you'll be very happy with.This camera is VERY REASONABLY PRICED!!! I got this camera for a very decent price ($325) on a Cyber Monday deal at Target... at that price, it's still a bargain. But at anything LESS tan that, it's a STEAL. You honestly can't get more camera for your dollar at the prices I've been seeing here on Amazon. Believe me, I've looked.My only knock against it is that the lens cover is not tethered to the camera body. I've already lost one... replacements are like $15, so be ready for that! It also would be nice to have a viewfinder but that would add to its size, so no biggie there. Honestly, I rarely have needed it.I highly recommend this camera.

I used my friend's iPhone and was blown away by the features like touch to focus, touch to take pictures, quick focus, ect...I went on a search to find a camera that had all those features, but had the quality of a DSLR. I bought this camera at Target, but returned it in order to by a Canon T2i for the video recording capabilities. I quickly realized my mistake, but Target stopped carrying the camera right before I went back to buy it again (they literally had it in the store and wouldn't sell it to me).I won in the end, because the brown version of this camera was much, much cheaper than the all black one at Target anyway. Sold!Compared to the T2i this product is \"newer technology.\" If you like to shoot in manual mode, better stick to a real DSLR, but for point and shoot with DSLR like quality, you've to love this one.Cons: The lens blocks the flash if you're too close to the subject. There is no hot shoe. The mic is right where your left pointer finger is going to want to sit, that's horrific, but I use a separate mic anyway. No mic input. The ISO is not easy to select, which is highly annoying. The IA Mode is usually good, but can sometimes be inconsistent. The LCD screen is great, but the functions displayed get in the way of the picture sometimes.The positives are so overwhelming that I've been able to easily work around the cons. I hate flash photography anyway (I use 3 softboxes on my shoots).This video mode is not as phenomenal as the T2i, but it's fantastic anyway. It also can actually auto focus, though you have to watch it, because it will focus on different items at it's own preference in IA mode.", "Date": "April 20, 2012"}, {"Title": "Better than expected but not as good as the Olympus Pl2", "Author": "DonewithNAS \"The Merry World of Books\"", "ReviewID": "R1DZ1BNKP2SBWK", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "My kids have olympus pl2s.

I thought I try out a micro 4/3 camera for the compact size. I didn't have very high expectations since it wasn't rated very high by the photography web sites but the price was great. Boy I was surprised by the shots I got event with the 14-42 kit lens. The photos are sharp and the colors are vibrant. The camera is light and small which makes it easier to carry.I've read people complaining about not having enough manual controls but personally I like using just the dial and the touch screen to access all the functions. It allows me to keep my eyes on the screen without having to hunt for different buttons. Also it has the PASM/ISO modes that give me all the controls I need for shooting. It even has a function button that I can program. The best thing about the camera is the ability to use the touch screen to focus and adjust depth of field.Some people also complained about hard to hold the camera because it's too small, but I hold it with two hands just like I hold the Canon T2i and didn't find any issues with the size.The low light performance is not great compared to my Canon but I bought the 20mm F1.7 pancake lens and it was a big improvement over the kit lens.Since this is an entry level camera, I didn't expect it to have all the bells and whistles. However I do wish they didn't leave out the stereo mic. In the future I will get a better Lumix or Olympus body to get the tilt screen/EVF/HDR functions but for now I really like the compactness and simple interface of the GF3.In summary, I do recommend the camera as a small, portable camera that takes decent pictures. It doesn't have all the bells and whistles compared to the more expensive models but for the price it's great. I've loaded three pictures titled \"GF3 with 14-42 kit lens\".

I was looking for something with fun options for user control but also with a good intelligent auto, and lovely picture quality.

If the touchscreen broke, the camera would still work.It shipped with a Vario lens, which takes very nice pictures... occasionally.  However, the intelligent auto setting, which I confess I use often, gives mixed results.  Inside, when a picture looks bright and crisp with lovely colors in the viewfinder, suddenly you'll push the shutter and end up with a dark or blurry picture.  The flash, on the other hand, is even worse than on other Panasonics, making subjects have that caught-in-the-act, candid camera look.  But without the flash subjects are too dark to see.I have the sneaking suspicion that if I had a better lens, I would have better picture quality.

I have only played with a little in the last week, but I have been impressed with its capabilities in both the manual and automatic focus.With the 42mm zoom fully extended, the photographer has the option of easily capturing things within 20-30 feet.  Any more than that, I think the zooming is best done in post-production editing.The size of this camera is something of a curiosity.  It is larger than a point and shoot, for sure (this camera will not fit in a pocket). But it's much smaller and lighter than my Pentax k20d, especially with the attached zoom. From a practical standpoint, I know that I like to travel light, especially when my plans include lots of walking and sightseeing on vacation.  This camera seems to fit my lifestyle, offering very impressive features and a camera that will easily fit in a small to medium-sized purse without weighing me down.The only reason that I don't give this camera 5 stars is because the micro four-thirds category is an anomaly.  It's functional as a point and shoot, but it's too big to fit in a pocket.  Still, it's not quite as robust and powerful as a true DSLR. It is very good for what it is, but I am anxious for the day when we'll get the same features in an even smaller package.", "Date": "September 27, 2012"}, {"Title": "A great step up", "Author": "Benjamin H. Mossberg", "ReviewID": "RLM4YUI7J1UBY", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Obviously this is not a professional DSLR. Anyone expecting a professional camera at this price is kidding themselves, but this camera is incredible. I bought it at Walmart for 450 bucks (I plan on returning it and buying again on amazon).The picture quality is incredible and the micro four thirds standard allows you to interchange with a fairly wide variety of lenses. When I bought this camera, I was also looking at the J1 and the Sony Nex. Although there isn't much grip, once you get used to it, it's not bad. I bought this because I wanted a lightweight, small form factor camera, with manual focus ring control and good optics. That's exactly what I got.One good thing about this camera is that while the manual focus ring is not a true mechanical focus ring, the autofocus is far superior to many other cameras I've tried and then the focus ring allows you to fine tune it fairly precisely in order to capture a beautiful shot.I wasn't impressed with intelligent auto mode because it cancels out the ability to manual focus the shot, and sometimes uses a color balance in the shot that looks bleached out or dull. I like the vivid color setting and the sensor really captures brilliant colors very well.Overall the camera is a great step up from pocket cameras without having to deal with bulkier and more costly digital cameras. I plan on buying the pancake lens in order to achieve an even smaller form factor for when I need it, but the included lens seems solid.The only two things I would improve on include:1) more features on the camera like a panorama mode2) make the lens zoom action smoother", "Date": "July 11, 2012"}, {"Title": "Returned due to focusing issues.", "Author": "THATCH \"RST\"", "ReviewID": "R2P76HEX4JSDHT", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "I'm well experienced with standard SLRs before the digital age, as well as with digital cameras from the beginning.

It is not described in the manual provided with the camera or downloaded from the Panasonic site, and its menu function is not available in the automatic (iA) mode.

Was going to go for a Nikon or Canon DSLR but was convinced after research and talking to salespeople that the compact system option would be better - more compact, easier to carry around, easy operation, plus interchangeable lenses. Was loving this camera for the first month, then the flash stopped working. Don't know what is wrong with it but am told I will have to ship it back for repair. With a new baby (the reason for the camera) I am not happy about having to return for repair a virtually brand new camera. The pop up flash seemed kind of flimsy, and I guess this is the result.UPDATE: have been using for about a year since the repaired flash and seems to be working just fine. Does take excellent pictures. My only quibbles are: 1) the user interface is very complicated. Camera is capable of much more than I am taking advantage of because I have found it challenging to navigate through the many menus. 2) Lenses and accessories are very expensive, reducing the value of interchangeable lenses. Batteries also very expensive. Tried knock-off batteries for a while but camera eventually rejected them. OEM batteries now on sale on BestBuy at steep discount. You definitely need to always have a charged spare battery with this camera. Also found on Olympus telephoto lens that works with this camera, takes great pics and is half the cost of the equivalent Lumix lens. 3) Wish it had a viewfinder for bright outdoor light conditions.
