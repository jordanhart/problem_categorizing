It's compares favorably to my Canon 5D Mark II and 7D. The small size, even with the G Vario 7mm lens makes it an easy choice to grab for \"what if\" situations. The MENU give such great choices in both stills and videos. Some of the video shot with this camera have been included in sequences shot with the above cameras plus Sony's CineAlta cams. Many delightful surprises with the LUMIX have made this one of my favorites. For the price HIGHLY recommended.", "Date": "November 9, 2011"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": "Unavailable", "Features": "Standard Accessories - Battery Charger/AC Adapter, Battery Pack, Body Cap, AV Cable, USB Connection Cable, AC Cable, DC Cable, Shoulder Strap, CD-ROMFeatures\nFull-HD Movie Recording in AVCHD - With the GH1, shooting incredible photos is only part of the fun.
