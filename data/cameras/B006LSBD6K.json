Fortunately all my lenses work just fine with the 1 V1 and it is a much more professional grade camera for a serious amateur that does not want to lug heavy equipment around. The picture quality is very good. The automatic features work better than any camera I have ever owned including some 35mm SLRs. If you make your living as a photographer this won't be your go to camera, however, you still might want to consider the 1 series those situations where smaller and lighter would make the difference.", "Date": "January 26, 2014"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": null, "Features": null, "Name": null, "ImgURL": null, "ProductID": "B006LSBD6K"}}
