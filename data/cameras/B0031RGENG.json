This camera is good simply because it isn't bad. In many P & S cameras there are so many things set by the camera software the user can't make important manual adjustments. Not the case here. For example, I shoot in Program mode and I select the ISO and the exposure compensation. Many P&S; cameras don't have a P mode. The monitor is plenty big. There are plenty of megapixels. The buttons stand out enough to be easy to push. The picture quality is good. The camera looks good and feels solid and well made. I really like a viewfinder even on a P&S; camera and this Olympus doesn't have one, so I give the camera 4 stars rather than 5 stars. But there is nothing wrong with this camera.", "Date": "July 9, 2010"}, {"Title": "Not the best for photos", "Author": "Charles Hathaway", "ReviewID": "R2V6QS7EXJHH9B", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "I've been very impressed with the video functions and video quality of this camera, but not as impressed with the photo functions - actually, I only have one issue with it. You can't adjust the shutter speed. You can adjust the \"exposure\" level, which effects the shutter speed, but you can only adjust the exposure between stops -2 and +2. I suspect this is the main reason people have trouble with getting too many blurry pictures with this camera. It adjusts the shutter speed first, then the f-stop or ISO if necessary. The average shutter speed it uses is between 40 and 80, even when you use the flash (even taking still life at that speed, you probably want to use a tripod to avoid blur).One way to compensate for the low (blurry) shutter speed is to turn the exposure level to the lowest possible, and then use the flash. That makes the camera speed go up to about 125 - fast enough for average pictures, but kind of tough if you are catching wiggly kids. This isn't as much of a problem in high sunlight. It will take 400 or 500 speed photos out there.It claims to be able to go up to 2000 speed, but I suspect the only way it ever would is if you turned the exposure level to +2 and took a zoomed in picture of the sun.This would be an awesome camera if it allowed you to manually adjust the shutter speed however you want. So if your focus in getting a camera is good simple video function, go for it, but if you're wanting to take good photos, go with a different camera - one that at least ALLOWS manual shutter speed adjusting.", "Date": "August 4, 2010"}, {"Title": "Not happy", "Author": "Jim", "ReviewID": "R1SL55F6MS7990", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "FE-47 14MP Digital Camera with 5x Optical Zoom and 2.7\" LCD - EAI was not happy about this product, but I think mine was defective and I returned it.

(sorry about the cough as I was sick at the time.)Review:After an auto accident I decided to get an inexpensive digital camera and keep it in my car. At first I bought a Vivitar for about 50 bucks from my local Walgreen's but it was a complete POS and ate through batteries like crazy. Then I saw this Olympus FE-47 at my local OfficeMax store (about 4 months ago) for only 79 dollars. I tried it out and decided to get it.So this camera should sell for no more than 80 dollars. I've seen it at other local stores for $80 or less.It's a compact camera that has 14 megapixels of resolution and 5x optical zoom. Since Olympus is a camera maker, the FE-47 has a good Olympus-branded lens. Obviously it's not top-notch, at this price, but its optics is better than much more expensive cameras from off-brands like GE or Samsung. The picture quality is actually pretty good; the only \"fault\" is the contrast tends to be a little flat, while most consumers would prefer more contrast. Of course, this can be easily \"fixed\" in software. (I put quotes here because professionals would prefer flat-contrast files because they can then rework those files however they like; too much contrast loses optical information which cannot be recovered.)Pictures taken on the camera are generally sharp and clear, thanks to the good optics. Shutter delay is about average for a camera in this class.  Now, to be honest, I was pretty happy with the FE-47's picture quality until I bought a Panasonic Lumix DMC-S3 14.1 MP Digital Camera with 4x Optical Image Stabilized Zoom with 2.7-Inch LCD (White) for just $20 more (from Costco) a month later. That camera has high picture quality, judiciously higher (but not too high) contrast, and better saturation; in other words, the Panny S3's pictures come out more pleasant to the eye. Plus the Panny is even smaller, lighter, and better built.  So I ended up putting the FE-47 where I had intended it to be: in my car's glove compartment.  And I carry my S3 everywhere I go.One interesting \"feature\" of the FE-47 is, it can optically zoom but when you choose this option, there is no audio recording. Alternatively, you can turn on audio recording in video mode, but then there is no optical zoom, only digital. My video clip shows the digital zoom with sound option.  My guess is the FE-47 is so cheaply built that the engineers didn't want to expend extra effort on silencing the zoom motor.  As you can see from my video clip, even on a beautiful day as it was, digital zoom sucks. Highest video quality is VGA (640x480) at 30fps, i.e., DVD quality.The FE-47 is generally easy to use, and there are many options to set. It's compatible with SD and SDHC cards, and it uses only 2 AA batteries -- either alkaline or rechargeable NiMH will do fine. I use Sanyo NEW 1500 eneloop 8 Pack AA Ni-MH Pre-Charged Rechargeable Batteries because they retain power much longer than regular NiMH batteries -- even longer than alkalines! There is a setting in the camera menu where you indicate whether you've put in alkaline or NiMH (on the last setup screen). Be sure to select the correct type so the camera can report remaining battery accurately.Overall, I think the FE-47 is a pretty good inexpensive camera.  It has good optics and picture quality.  Shutter lag is average which means it can be a bit of a problem when you need to capture fast-fleeting moments.  But it uses 2 AA batteries and battery life is quite good.  Optical zoom without sound in video is weird but at least it's an option (no optical zoom in the Panny S3's video mode at all).  If you can get this for $80 or less, it's a good deal.  And I personally think everyone should own one digicam that takes AA batteries, whether you travel abroad or not.Check the picture gallery for my sample photos, all untouched and taken casually.", "Date": "September 23, 2011"}, {"Title": "Better off with a CVS disposable", "Author": "solana35", "ReviewID": "R25GEFE6JQTOAF", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I took three rounds of pictures, 80% of which came out blurry.
