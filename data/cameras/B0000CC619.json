{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Good all around camera for the non-professional user", "Author": null, "ReviewID": "R1EZ9NF17ZOVEW", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I wouldn't pay so much attention to the first person's review seeing as how that person is rating a digital camera's score based on its video functions.So, most of you who are shopping for this camera probably are purchasing it as a first time camera (like I did) or possibly a gift for someone else.  I've been overly impressed with this camera.  It has a very nice macro lens (and mode) that's user friendly.  I can easily focus on subjects only 2.5\" from my lens.  It's great for artistic purposes or if you just need to get the camera close to the subject matter.I chose this camera over others because it offered a 6x optical zoom which is easily out of the effective range of the flash.  This digital camera (like almost all) depends on the flash to maintain focus for the majority of its images.  For in-focus distance images (not scenery shots), say like a graduation, you'll need a tripod to obtain images with excellent clarity.  Since the flash will be out of range, you'll have to turn it off, but the camera needs to be incredibly still in order to obtain perfect images.With that said, the camera can do action shots.  I'm not too sure why the other person couldn't obtain shots without them being blurred, but I was able to capture images of my friends practicing kickboxing with no motion blur (which even surprised me).  Those images were obtained using the flash.  Not only that, but I've taken pictures while driving in my car and I captured an image of a van I was driving by and scenery on the side.  Doing 70mph pass the trees on the side of the road and getting almost no motion blur, I have trouble seeing as how the reviewer couldn't get pictures of his children running around.Clarity on images is excellent and grain is almost nonexistent.  The camera offers many modes including sports, continuous (two consecutive shots only), night (good night time color, but needs a tripod for sure), landscape (beautiful pictures), portait, and a few others.This is definitely a good starter camera, and like all cameras to effectively utilize all of the options available, you have to just learn how to use the camera for whatever situation needed.  My biggest complaint would have to go to the slow focusing/charging modes.  It makes it hard to capture moments when you're having to focus the subject first.  However, most cameras I've played with in this price range do not offer much faster, if at all, focus speeds.  It's the only camera I've seen with a 6x optical zoom (which is what you want, no digital zoom) under $300, and it also has an adapter ring if you'd ever like to upgrade your range.As far as the software, it's not anything spectacular but it worked for me.  Also, it's easy to use for those not too familiar with computers (slideshows, cd burning, etc.).  I'm running on Windows 98, and my computer recognized the camera as a massive storage device as well; however, if you follow the installation process correctly, the software should correct that problem (the manual advises not to connect the camera prior to installing the software).", "Date": "December 16, 2003"}, {"Title": "Good but some flaws", "Author": "Nicholas Namias \"fatmanrox\"", "ReviewID": "R31TDKOWN9VF0N", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "I've been burned by big brands with poor reliability before, so I chose Fuji after seeing Consumer's Union rate Fuji very reliable. It's big and clunky, but we wanted that shape to find it quickly in a cluttered diaper bag.Right out of the box, if you've ever had a digital camera before, you barely need the instruction book. It's very intuitive. The LCD and viefwinder  are bright, sharp, and are things of beauty. The on screen menus are great. The controls and grip are all manageable with one hand, once you learn where they are. The pictures are 3.2 megapixel great. The 6x optical zoom makes it easy to take quality face shots from a distance. Beware ANYBODY'S digital zoom - it's nonsense - only optical counts.The software for your PC is so bad that Fuji should have never shipped it. First of all, my Windows XP PC will not see the Finepix as a camera. It sees it as a mass storage device. So, if you are good with geek stuff, you know how to get your pictures to go where you want them, but if you just want it to be easy, you are out of luck. This software precludes this camera from being a gift for your mother. If you manually install the USB driver, Win XP still doesn't see it as a camera. The Finepix Viewer software is just a Fuji branded Internet Explorer. There is also one item of software installed called WINASPI. There is no explanation for what it does, it is installed in your root directory ( a major software no no), it looks like a throwback to Win 3.1 when it's being installed, and it gives you messages suffering from translationitis (For to make setup effective, it necessarily will be for to resart your computing system now.)In calculating the true cost, at a minimum, you will have to get a 64mb xD card, and you will have to get 8 NiMH AA batteries and a charger. The use of AA batteries is a huge plus, so when you are walking around Wallyworld and the batteries go dead, you can just buy 4 AAs, as opposed to cameras with proprietary rechargeables. You will also want some good photo organizing software, and because of the miserable software included, I've discovered a GREAT program online called Picasa -it is a must have GREAT photo organizer.So, I like it, I'm happy I bought it, the price was good, but it's not perfect.", "Date": "November 28, 2003"}, {"Title": "Nice Camera, Easy To Use  -  Worth the Extra Money !!", "Author": "\"ruffrider17\"", "ReviewID": "R2AVTS4DTPGYFU", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This was our first digital camera and we are very pleased with it. The documentation includes a \"quick start\" page to get you going right away. After reading it and installing the batteries, we were taking very nice pictures in less than an hour. The camera is lightweight and can easily used with one hand. The controls and menus are easy to use and simple to learn and remember. One small complaint regarding the LCD monitor that can be used in place of the viewfinder. The image in the monitor apprears washed out if you are not looking directly into it. This does not affect the photo image and is a very minor annoyance.  We have taken indoor pictures in a variety of lighting conditions using the built-in flash and every picture has been great. We also went outside on a sunny day and took pictures of a snowman in a blindingly, white, snow covered, yard and the pictures again turned out great. The zoom options are very nice and easy to use. The autofocus feature works great.Downloading the pictures into the computer is also very easy. The included software installed flawlessly. Then, using the included USB cable, connect the camera to your PCs USB port and turn on the camera. The rest is automatic. The software downloads the pictures from the camera to your computer's hard drive. The program also gives you various option for cropping or other tweaks you may wish to make to improve your pictures.This is a great digital camera package for the price. Certainly, you can spend a lot more for a lot more camera, for professional applications.

Most of the pictures I take are of my family and friends.I purchased the S3000 in July 2004, right before our vacation toFlorida. I was having trouble deciding between purchasing a new 35mm or my first digital camera. After reading reviews on various digitals and talking with a friend who had just purchased the Fugi S3000, I chose the S3000 and I have had 'no regrets.'The pictures are better than I imagined. They are so clear and detailed that I take photographs of everything from buildings, animals, close-up of flowers, and more. The Fugi S3000 is so easy to use. It is, more or less, a point and shoot camera and the zoom is fantastic.I only had two minor problems. The first one was the action shots: I rectified my action shots (jet skis, running, swimming) by snapping the picture as soon as I saw the person/object in the LCD monitor. By the time the shutter reacted, I pretty much had a nice centered picture.Since I am a novice with this camera, the second problem I assumed was my fault. From our hotel room on Cocoa Beach, we could see a night launch. I could not find the launch site nor the satillite after it was launched in my LCD monitor or viewfinder.I give the Fugi S3000 - 5 stars - for the ease of use, detail of the photographs and the 6x optical zoom.I am so impressed with this camera that I am buying two more for Christmas presents.Also look at:Fugifilm Digital Camera Accessory Kit for A & S Series Cameras  (includes battery charger and batteries - YOU NEED THIS!)Fugifilm 64MB XD Card  (need a second card)Fugifilm USB XD Picture Card Reader  (I found this cheaper at Wal-Mart)", "Date": "October 4, 2004"}, {"Title": "Good camera, but the auto shutoff feature sucks", "Author": "ideas", "ReviewID": "R21615U890C39G", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I've had this camera about a year now, and I really like it for the most part.  Good pics, good features, and I love the 6X optical (not digital!) zoom.  Having had it, I'd never buy a camera with a lower power zoom.  It's also really hard to beat this camera for the money.  Usually when my friends show off their new cameras I see they've paid more and gotten less, especially in the zoom department.I use rechargable 2200 MA NIMH batteries and have not experienced any problem with battery life whatsoever, unlike other reviewers.  I've taken a couple hundred shots at a time (mostly non flash, admittedly) without changing batteries.  The camera is also well made and sturdy.  It took a nasty fall with me near Mount Rainier a while back and sustained very little damage, unlike my knees and elbows.While the camera is good, it isn't perfect.  I have three complaints, as follows.  Once you hit the button, this camera takes a really long time to actuate the shutter.  If you're looking for a camera to capture fast motion, pass this one by.  Often when I was zoomed in on an object moving even at a pretty slow pace, the object would be out of the field of view by the time the picture clicked.My second (and most serious) complaint is the auto-shutoff feature.  The camera loves to shut itself off and retract the lens when you've been idle.  And in Fuji's book, TWO minutes is idle.  This is something I've not experienced with previous Fujis.  When it does turn off, you have turn the dial around two places to the OFF position, wait a second, then click it back two places to ON.  The lens will slowly reappear, and you can resume what you were doing.  The auto shutoff would be fine if the length of time were adjustable, but it isn't.  Two minutes idle and you'll be \"rebooting\".  I'd much rather change batteries after a couple hours than have to toggle that damn switch all day to keep the camera on.  Very annoying.Finally, I'm not thrilled that this camera uses the XD format.  While the XD cards are very compact, they are also the most expensive format out there as best I can tell.  If you thought Memory Stick was expensive, prepare yourself for XD.  It is more expensive than Memory Stick, SD, Smartmedia, and Compact Flash.  More expensive by a wide margin, too. Compare prices between a 256 MB XD card and a 256 compact flash, and you'll find the xd to be almost exactly twice as expensive.  That's a lot to pay for a smaller form factor card that does exactly the same thing.In conclusion:  Good quality camera with good pics and great zoom, well worth the money if you don't mind the couple of annoyances I mentioned.  Hey, Fuji!  Kill the Auto Shutoff and you'll go to five stars in my book.", "Date": "July 5, 2004"}, {"Title": "Poor Action shots", "Author": "Barry Weinzimmer", "ReviewID": "R2TILYWEX9PJHM", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "Overall I am very happy with this camera for still shots.

I first used the S3000 at a Pittsburgh Pirate baseball game. The images taken using the \"sports\" function came out beautifully. Impressive colors, little grain, and any blur to the images were the fault of my own and not the camera. A few days later, I used the camera at a WWE event and it was there the camera really proved itself--the images of the wrestlers performing moves were incredible. While the sports function works wonderfully, the camera also takes excellent still life and portrait shots. While the 3.2 Megapixel capability is not the best on the market, still images come out looking quite nicely--better than images captured using an ordinary camera. The camera itself is extremely user friendly. The enclosed quickguide will have you shooting pictures right out of the box if you so desire. The menus are easily navagated and switching from one mode to another is a piece of cake. One caveat: although the battery life is long, the viewfinder is also digital instead of a standard viewfinder, so the batteries may not last as long as you'd like.

Over the years I've settled on features in digital cameras that work for my needs, and this one meets them all.  The breakdown:Pros:* Sturdy.  Early after getting this camera, my cat had a run-in with it where the strap got hooked around his neck, something spooked him and he took off, camera crashing around behind him.  I'm pleased to say that both cat and camera lived, and neither were damaged in any way.  Hat's off to Fujifilm for making an indestructable digicam!* Picture quality is excellent.  I need a camera with a hefty optical zoom and this one has it.  Recently I was able to capture a photo of my friend recieving her diploma... From high up in the bleachers and over 500 feet away from her!  The picture is crystal clear, too!* Good with all lighting conditions.  Daylight, low-light, indoor, outdoor, this camera performs well under all conditions.* Fast recovery period between snap shots.  There is between a 2-3 second recovery period between pictures, which is nice.  It insures that you're able to get a series of photos fired off in a quick succession, which is great if you're taking pictures of people in action.* Easy to transfer photos from the camera to my computer.  I use a Mac, and this camera works flawlessly with it.  The software is basic... I don't use it for major picture editing (that's what Photoshop is for), but the software package will crop and resize, orient, etc.* Print quality is excellent.  I can upload my photos via the net to my photo processing store and they print them out using a high-quality printer on photo paper for 11 cents a print.  The prints from this camera are crystal clear and look indistinguishable from ones taken with a film camera.Cons:* Size.  I thought at first that I wouldn't mind the size of the S3000, but after having had it for several months, I'm starting to bring my crappy Olympus with me places where I don't have the space to haul around a clunky camera.  Even though it's a fabulous point-and-shoot camera that comes through time and time again, it's quite a bit bigger than most point-and-shoot digicams which can make it a little awkward to lug around.* Battery life stinks.  The one good thing I can say about my Olympus D520 is that it has great battery life, and this is one area where the S3000 just doesn't impress me.  It takes 4 AA batteries and sucks them dry in no time, despite supposedly being more efficient than the previous version.  All in all, I'd have to say that the pros far outweigh the cons with this camera.

This camera is easy to use, versatile, gets good results, and is reasonably priced.To see some photos taken with this camera, go to BetterPhoto.com. Click on \"photos\" at the top, scroll down to \"by camera\" and enter Fuji Finepix S3000 in the search. It will bring up some links. Click on the name of the camera under \"reviews\". You will see a product detail and a thumbnail photo to the right of the page. Under it will say, \"view photos created with this camera.\" Click on that to see pix taken with it. (I am not sure if I am allowed to put a direct link here).What I love about this camera:1. Its size. I can stick it in my purse and I can hold it comfortably with one hand. It's not too heavy or awkward to grab quickly or to carry around.2. The macro setting. This has allowed me to get some detailed close-up shots of insects, frogs, toads and other small critters -- even those who aren't always likely to stand still.3. The optical zoom. I have also used that to get good shots of critters. It's not a super powerful zoom but it is decent. And if you are willing to move around, too, you can get close enough to butterflies or frogs to get a nice photo.4. In general, this photo does excellent \"still life\" type photos. I've done some really neat studio-type stuff with it.5. Less shutter lag than any other point-and-shoot digital camera I have used. Shutter lag is a fact of life for any point-and-shoot digital camera. If you can't work around shutter lag, you need a film camera or a digital SLR, which will cost you at least 3 times as much as this model.6. It's pretty darned good in low light. It will capture photos without the flash that my film SLR will not. With ANY camera -- even a digital SLR or 35mm -- if you are shooting in low light without flash, you want to use a tripod, brace yourself against a wall or something (and take multiple shots of the same thing), or set the camera down on a table or stack of books. Few cameras have the capability of taking night shots without some camera shake caused by the photographer's movement while the camera takes the picture. See the review by \"an electronics fan.\"If you buy this camera (or the newer model which is an S700, I think), here are my recommendations:1. Shoot a lot of frames. I bought the 2 GB memory card and it holds 1300 photos on the highest resolution setting. I have never filled the card! And my family teases me by spoofing the song \"500 Miles\" as \"500 Frames\" so it's not that I don't try. :-) I got my butterfly shots through patience and a lot of frames. I did end up with a couple nice shots of just flowers (because the butterfly left before I could get the shot). I just accept that.2. Get rechargeable batteries. It's about a $30 investment for the battery charger and two sets of AA rechargeable batteries. But it will save you a lot of money in the long run.3. Experiment. Try different settings for the same subject and see how they turn out. You will get a lot more from this point-and-shoot than any other one on the market, IMHO.Thanks for reading.

I don't know if mine is just a fluke or what, but one thing that cannot be denied is the high file size.Upload them to your computer and even at the lowest bit setting you're still looking at about 400kb. Most digital cameras only use 100kb or so, and seeing as how this takes very blurry photos - what's the point of the extra file size?I try to stand as still as I can when taking photos.

I have tried all kinds of batterys and it doesn't matter. The camera seems to use up the life of the battery's even if it is turned off.

It runs on four AA batteries, and since I had asked for a camera take pictures of local rock bands, I quickly discovered one set of four batteries would not get me through one three hour show!When we brought it back to Circuit City, they (rudely, never again) informed us that this camera was outdated (it was less than a month in my possession) and they wouldn't return it.  We called Fuji directly and they recommended rechargeable batteries.  We bought some good ones, and now I can get through whole day festivals.  I have had the camera for a year and a half now, and although I have to turn the flash on and and cover it with my hand to get good lowlight pictures, I am really happy with it's performance.  If you are looking for a great \"day at the beach with friends\" camera, this is it.  For serious forrays into nighttime photography, you will need to spend a little more money.My vacation shots are perfect, my band shots are hit or miss.It is/was the perfect starter camera.*Edit on 12-2-2012 to say that this camera was pretty versatile for the four years it worked. In the summer of 2008 I took it to Lollapalooza. It got quite hot that day and the camera shut itself off mid-photo. I wasn't too worried as this had happened before at hot outdoor concerts including a previous 103 degree Lolla. Eventually it cooled off and started working again, but in terms of reliability, it was never the same. Regardless of the temperature, it would randomly turn itself off (lens out) and then in 2010, it stopped working altogether. I think it was the perfect first camera, but I did notice that Fuji doesn't process true to color. Last christmas I picked up a cheap (black friday special) Fuji point and shoot. After a few years of using a Canon Powershot, the color on the Fuji is noticeably different. I went back to look at old shots with this camera and notice it's a Fuji thing. The colors are over-saturated. Everything has a neon cast and sometimes looks surreal. It's unlikely that I'll be buying any more Fuji products.", "Date": "September 8, 2006"}, {"Title": "Need to find stuff for dig.

I had been planning on buying a 3800 soon, before Christmas - since I was all ready sold on my daughter's FinePix 2800, which is a great camera and uses batteries so sparingly (3800 and 2800 are pretty much the same camera but with different pixel densities).However, after I got the S3000 home and shot a few pics, I discovered that this so called 'IMPROVED' version of the 3800 has NO AUDIO mode for the video - whew! what an improvement, 'silent digital movies.' When I returned the 3000 to the store for a refund, I discover that best buy has a 15% restocking fee - cost me $45 to return.  Unhappy me.So today I am searching the net for a good buy on the older 3800, which has Audio & Video - and only a 6X zoom, less than the 10X zoom on the S3000. So do you want Audio and Video or 10X zoom?", "Date": "November 9, 2003"}, {"Title": "Zero stars...", "Author": null, "ReviewID": "R3V3D606A1N626", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "i'm in the process of trying to return this camera.
