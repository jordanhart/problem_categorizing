prissy \"1-star\" Mac user. Being in the publishing business since the Macintosh IIsi (1993) days; and on a PC for the last 7 doing telecom QA , I've seen both sides. I recall that I had to buy the \"right\" kind of memory card for my GoPro, a micro-SD for my new phone - plus update the firmware. It's just a fact of life; millennials seem to expect everything to be done for them .;-)Anyway, what do I think of this device? It's not bad. The package is good, video quality is good for 720p, but the price is excellent for what you get - especially if you don't want all the whistles and bells of the more expensive GoPro (2-4x more expensive). Besides, this camera is for a totally different niche. The Looxcie cameras are for simultanious sharing for those who can't be there to experience \"the moment.\"I like this camera to smack down my friends! So here's a typical Looxcie scenario in my world. Some of my friends think I'm crazy because I fly paragliders - and I'm almost 66 years old! So while they're on the ground watching, I turn on the camera, wi-fi to my phone, invite them, and fly off the hill. I get to experience the thrill - they get to watch on their phones with envy!Is everything perfect? No. I've been a very early user of their products, so I've suffered the experience of \"co-development\" - as does every user who has to be first with a new toy. Getting the software to work with my 2\u00bd year phone (the only toy I don't upgrade monthly) has been problematic. But what should I expect - it won't work with my Ericsson T65! But for $99, here's what you get (video).", "Date": "November 25, 2013"}, {"Title": "Looxcie 3 and dive case:", "Author": "Wayne Grabowski", "ReviewID": "R1BNTN1TFKSSZZ", "Overall": "4.0", "Content":

LOL.(FWIW no action cam I've ever bought came with a memory card.)I've been using my Looxie 3 SCUBA diving.  Having access to the power button saves the battery, though a swapable battery would be nice.  Barring that I'll either find a way to charge it during my surface interval or just buy a second. The shutter button is big and easy to use with gloved hands.  The colors and field of view are good.I've uploaded a short video I put together from a couple of dives with the Looxcie 3. Nothing fancy---just the clips, cross fades and some simple titles.", "Date": "November 25, 2013"}, {"Title": "More affordable than GoPro and awesome features for the $$$$!", "Author": "ATXAMZFAN \"JRM\"", "ReviewID": "RERLWO1F6UQLG", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Bought this for my in-laws as an early X-mas gift and had a chance to use it. Video quality is great and camera is easy to use. I was able to sync the Looxcie 3 up to my Mac and iPhone and posting video to Facebook was pretty easy to accomplish. For the money this is a great little action camera. I should have purchased the Looxcie 3 Social Pack version as it comes with more accessories. I plan on buying them the waterproof case so they can use it to record their snorkeling adventures in Mexico. A micro SD card is required so don't forget to add that if your're buying as a gift.Postives:- camera is small and lightweight- easy to use- live Facebook streaming- great price for what you get....so much more affordable than some other similar action camerasNegatives:- need to purchase microSD card separately...but to be fair this is the same for all of the other cameras you buy- Ap doesn't allow you to control the unit to take still shots you have to use the button on the camera- really need to buy the social clip or some of the other mounting accessories", "Date": "December 9, 2013"}, {"Title": "Great camera for the price and size", "Author": "PIL K JUNG", "ReviewID": "RZ5FHM30KRYQR", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "The Looxcie 3 POV Camera is so great for my uses.

I bought the camera and the social clip accessory. The camera clips onto clothes like a shirt or a jacket, so it is kind of different from other action cameras that way.I do a lot of cooking, so I like to make how-to videos for friends and family and this shows them what I do as I move around. It would also be good to use to make a video at a wedding reception because you can get the perspective of the guests as things are happening. The Looxcie can do a temporary background recording like a DVR and if something happens you can press the record button and it goes back and grabs the last 30 seconds and makes a permanent clip of it.I would like to see them offer an external battery and maybe they should offer a microSD card option at purchase since you need one.", "Date": "November 30, 2013"}, {"Title": "Mac user review", "Author": "Caroline Lee", "ReviewID": "R15YKB6UVPWGYM", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "cute little wifi video/camera, love all the accessories you can buy for it (especially the covers)Pros:not bulky and hardly noticeablehd picture quality is surprisingly goodWifi range is great, I can use it all over my houseCons: none so far, I\u2019ll update if I find any", "Date": "November 27, 2013"}, {"Title": "Live WiFi delay 1/2 second, best yet! Other issues tho...", "Author": "Jim Valentine", "ReviewID": "RU3FTY8VXZ8PT", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "This review is purely from the perspective of using the camera for live monitoring. I've been trying to find a wireless camera that I could use for a back up camera with my various vehicles. I've tried the Go Pro and the Canon WiFi cameras, but those both had a delay of 4-5 seconds when viewing on a phone or tablet in live mode, which is virtually useless for my purposes. I've been playing with the Looxcie 3 for a few days now, and here's what I've found:Pros:Relatively short time delay over WiFi in live view modeHas a waterproof case available ($50)Pretty good video quality for my purposesTech support was as advertised and friendlyQuite inexpensive - 1/3 the cost of the Go Pro or Canon WiFiCons:Short battery life - I got around 45 minutes on a full chargeDisconnects pretty easily from phone or tabletLooxcie no longer pursuing the personal camera line, so future app development/support may not be forthcomingHorrible manualCamera won't transmit when chargingAs the review title says, the Looxcie camera has about a 1/2 second live delay, which is by far the best of the 3 cameras I tried. I used the camera with an iPad Air and an Android phone. Both work, but the Galaxy phone seemed to lose it's connection more often and easily than the iPad. Neither connection was rock solid though and once the camera disconnects you need to quit and restart the app (not the device) to re-connect. For iOS you must have version 6.1 or later to use the Looxcie 3 camera, and for a computer you need Mountain Lion or higher (I'm a Mac, not a PC but I think Windoes XP SP3 or higher works).The camera doesn't come with a memory card, so you'll need a mini SD card to do anything - it won't even finish powering up without the SD card installed.Range is about 40' line of sight, and as little as 10' with walls between the camera and the receiver (tablet or phone). I was able to use it in the cab of my truck with the camera on the back of my trailer, which is about 40' back, so the truck cab seems to be less of a deterrent to the wifi signal than walls.Tech support is by email only, but they got back to me within 1 business day as advertised, and the very nice tech guy actually called me the second day to help work out the problem I was having getting the live streaming to work on the tablet/phone. Turns out you must put a WiFi password into the camera before it will fully connect to the app, and to do this you need to connect the camera to a computer (not a phone or tablet) via USB cord (included) and connect using their free desktop software.This brings us to the manual, which is just a little quick start sheet you download from the website. It didn't say anything about the WiFi password, and didn't even explain the meaning of the all the different combinations the 4 lighted icons on the back of the camera may flash at you . It only explains the light combinations I guess they thought were important, but I've experienced at least 2 signals not covered in manual. Not sure what the camera is trying tell me in those cases. The documentation is basically worthless for an in depth understanding of the device.The short battery life is probably understandable in such a small and inexpensive device, and it charges via USB so that's straightforward. But don't think you can plug a USB battery or other power supply into the camera to get extra run time. As soon as anything is plugged in that provides power, the camera stops streaming. I'm not sure if it would still record to the SD card, as I never tried recording. I was able to get a full charge back into the fully discharged camera from a USB battery pack in about 1.5 hours, for those who may want to use the camera away from any generated power. This is about the same time as it takes to charge when plugged into a regular powered USB source.That's it. I'm going to keep this camera, as it's the only thing I've found that works for my specific needs, and I think it's a pretty good deal for what you get.", "Date": "April 9, 2014"}, {"Title": "Loving this device", "Author": "Melissa J.", "ReviewID": "R1J121GJZ5NFE5", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I would recommend this.

Customer service seemed to be on top of the. problem and indicated they were aware of the problem and were testing a new version of the app  that would be ready by end of the month.

If you buy the optional SD card (MicroSDHC/SDXC only, not included) you can save an hour and a half of  720p/30fps video (lower quality than most any phone camera, which run at several megapixels), or you can upload video to the company's own social network, a kind of a low grade UStream like video chat / video channel website for users of this product.  Or you can post the videos to Facebook.  Watch out: by default it begins immediately posting videos to this network and Facebook on initial set up, including your location information.  I can't find any other way to use the video output. I suppose you can connect it to a PC via USB and pull the video files off it manually.It can't be used as a PC or Mac webcam, and really does nothing ANY modern phone does not, except with a modern phone you have flexibility of how you share the video as files, streams, variety of social media, etc.  With this you're locked in to their Looxcie social media site and (by reposting from Looxcie) Facebook sharing.I suppose the attraction is that you can hang it around your neck and go skiing or something.  But you can do this with a phone.  And this thing costs $100, so it's not like you can use it as some disposable video camera for mountain climbing or something.The desktop software is awkward, slow to set up, and devoid of options.  Once installed, the software allowed me to set a password for its wifi broadcast and a fixed ip (and note, phones and other devices must connect to the device's wifi signal to use it, meaning they can no longer be connected to your home network and, ya'know, the internet!) and that's the extent of it.  You can use the desktop software to download firmware patches too, but only if you buy a MicroSDHC/SDXC card. This happens by default, and the software just hangs if there is now card inserted.  Forget any other desktop software features. And as noted, the cloud based Looxcie software -- to which the phone app connects your device to automatically -- has major privacy issues unless you are very careful.  The battery life seems low.  I've been recharging this after first use for several hours and it still is off line: it also won't run on USB power, it must recharge the battery via USB and then run off battery power.I have no clue why anyone would buy this thing.  This was a gift, but otherwise, I'd avoid unless you have some specific niche use for an expensive clip on low quality video camera you will use to share via Facebook.", "Date": "December 25, 2013"}, {"Title": "camera", "Author": "Linda P. \"catmaven\"", "ReviewID": "RIVRXDJJHDOV9", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I'm sorry but  I sent your product as a gift so it is hard for me to rate it.
