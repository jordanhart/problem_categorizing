I could just stop the review right there.However, I must press on...this camera got a major unfair handshake and the score needs to be settled.The K-01 came out at a time when the press made expectations from every camera manufacturer about releasing their own mirrorless camera. And because the K-01 didn't meet their expectations, the press misunderstood this camera greatly. They lambasted it for the most part calling it ugly, fat, and totally missing the point - amongst other things.Totally unfair.Mirrorless today is still an experimental and developing camera platform. There were no rules then, and there are no rules now for this new frontier. As camera sales started to slide because of the digital camera bubble bursting and a poor economy, few camera makers started taking to experimentation again to fuel consumer demand, others just continued with the safe bet.Pentax, instead of making yet another \"me too\" camera like many other makers chose to do, decided to do something courageous and different with the K-01's design. And instead of being praised for experimentation (something the press and enthusiasts normally demand) the \"different kid\" on the block was made fun of and ridiculed.The K-01 was designed to target a different audience. This is a fun camera, meant to put the spontaneity into photography and draw in shooters who were normally intimidated by the look of a DSLR. There's a touch of class to the design, and thinking outside of the box. Yet despite its intent, the K-01 is also capable of high level performance ensuring new users could grow into the camera and learn. The K-01 also gave a much smaller body available for Pentax users who wanted something a little different and compact to shoot with when needed. The K-01 was obviously not meant to be a pocketable camera, and this was on purpose- it wasn't an oversight as many press seemed to think. It's also not nearly as large as reviews would have you believe.A huge advantage- Instead of starting a new lens mount that would derail owners of K mount lenses, this camera allows instant compatibility with all K mount lenses. Wasn't that hardly noticed by press? Sure it was mentioned, but not applauded as it should have been, and gives the K-01 a major advantage over competitors.The K-01 has many abilities and features that other makes and models only dream of. Its menu system is replete with customizable functions and sports high end features that allow the camera to shoot in a very wide range of circumstances- just like many high end Pentax DSLRS. Yet its looks and design manage to cater to those who want a simple but fun shooting experience. It's image quality scores the highest among ANY mirrorless camera even today. It's new firmware, showing full support by Pentax of its buyers, gave the K-01 much faster autofocus and additional features and stability.It's battery life, handling, video capabilities, and studio photography capabilities are top notch - adding to the value of the K-01 even more.Take this to a party and I guaranty you may get a couple laughs, but you'll get a lot more praise for a fun loving camera that can shoot better images than most Canon DSLRS on the market today. Laugh until you see its images. Ridicule till you know its capabilities. Then lets see who's talking.The K-01 isn't a perfect camera by any means, but no camera is. I dare anyone though to take this camera out for a day, come back and look at the images, and say they aren't impressed. If you let your guard down about it's looks, you might even enjoy shooting with it, and what do you know- even start to like it.A camera that shows high owner satisfaction despite the short sighted press, its a winner to it's owners.(A full review of this camera will be posted on my blog dub dub dub photographic-central dot blogspot dot com in the coming weeks).Carl", "Date": "November 20, 2013"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": null, "Features": null, "Name": null, "ImgURL": null, "ProductID": "B00DQ6IMGY"}}
