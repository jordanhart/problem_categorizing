{"Reviews": [{"Title": "The only Ultra-Compact Photo/Video Camera on market", "Author": "Platopus \"gemo\"", "ReviewID": "R1XTCFHQOV07Z1", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "The only ultra-compact camera on the market that doubles as a camcorder! Casio cameras are the only ones supporting MPEG-4 video recording. That means 1 hour of 640x480 video per 1 Gb of storage!!! Competitors can do only 6 minutes. (Mpeg4 offers 10 times better compression over Mpeg1 that other cameras use).This model also has a dedicated video record button. (my previous Casio camra I had to wade through menus instead).That means on a cheap 16GB SD card you can get 16 hours of video, or a photo/video mix.Other thing I liked was form factor: the height is lower than previous casio cameras, but it is not as slim, with flat bottom, which means you can put it down on fence or car roof for time-delayed photo, and it will not topple over. Don't need to drag around a tripod.", "Date": "January 19, 2009"}, {"Title": "Good Camera", "Author": "Brian Chapman \"Chappy\"", "ReviewID": "R2PR9IYH2TU4LR", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I did a lot of research before purchasing this camera.  This is my 3rd point and shoot, and ultimately it is my second Casio.  I thought the first time I bought one I was going to get hosed on camera capability but was looking forward to finding out how to conducting complex mathematical equations.  I was actually very pleased with my first one, and ultimately ended up going with the Casio Z250 to replace it.  It is very easy to use, and takes excellent pictures. The size is perfect and the extra large lcd is awesome.  The best part of the camera is the \"Best Images\" features, which quickly adjusts your camera settings to take certain types of pictures (ie water, dog, action, poloroid, scenic, night, etc.)  It has many of the same features that more expensive cameras have for a lower price.  I would recommend this camera over all others currently on the market in its price range.", "Date": "April 18, 2009"}, {"Title": "Good picture quality, poor resiliency", "Author": "Ian M. Reasor", "ReviewID": "R1XDYLBP3COP6Y", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "The picture quality from this camera is great, mainly due to the fact that there is a preset mode for just about any occasion that you could think of.  After owning the camera for a week, I took it on a week-long vacation to Death Valley.  I think that the sand may have been too much for it and the lens mechanism had to be replaced.  That being said, Casio was very friendly and helpful on the phone.  I had to pay shipping to send the camera to their repair center, they fixed it and paid the shipping to send it back to me.  All-in-all, it took about a week.I would highly recommend this camera for anyone looking for a good quality point and shoot; the only caveat to that being that it may not be the right camera for you if you're the adventurous outdoorsy type.", "Date": "May 31, 2009"}, {"Title": "Nice camera", "Author": "Pam Allen \"Dog Mom\"", "ReviewID": "R1NQ5ZV48YAC49", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "This is a replacement for a previous Casio that I dropped while camping.  The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars was that the only thing I find annoying is that you have to remove the battery to charge it.  My previous camera had a dock that i charged from.  It takes great photo's and easy to navigate.  Large screen to view photo's and light weight.", "Date": "February 2, 2009"}, {"Title": "comments", "Author": "Juan Vivas", "ReviewID": "RDROZAZO54APY", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I bought this article.

First the body is very poorly made.  It has a gap between the front and back of the camera.  You can actually see inside the camera! Cosmetic aside the camera just take bad pictures.  Almost all my pictures came out blurry and there is a even long delay before the preview is shown.  I even uploaded to my computer to see if it's any better.  It's not.  My 5 years old Panasonic camera takes much better pictures.  The only thing good about this camera is the screen size.  At this pricing point there are much better cameras out there.", "Date": "May 4, 2009"}, {"Title": "User friendly", "Author": "Susanne Hagen", "ReviewID": "R3QX93UZQF5E26", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I bought this camera for my parents, and they were very satisfied.

My opinion is better than the flip HD.Overall it's a great camera for the price of $95 I bought.  I would recommend people to buy.", "Date": "February 10, 2011"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": "$279.99", "Features": "9MP with 4x zoom\nWide angle lens\nYou Tube ready\nCCD shift stablizer\nFace detection", "Name": "Casio Exilim EX-Z250SR 9MP 4x Zoom 3-Inch LCD Screen Digital Camera with 28mm Wide Angle Lens CCD-shift Image Optical Stabilizer (Silver)", "ImgURL": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/514rcxpcjDL._SY300_.jpg", "ProductID": "B001F9JZBU"}}
