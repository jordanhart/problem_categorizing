{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Bundle is junk, buy camera on its own!", "Author": "PhotoGuy", "ReviewID": "R4O7E8LXC4ZNC", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "I bought this bundle impressed with the value of the contents for the price.  Boy was I wrong!  I should've bought the camera on its own and the individual pieces locally at a camera accessory store. The T3i and 18-55mm lense are great!  The 75-300mm lense is NOT the IS-USM(image stabilized, ultra sonic motor) version.  It doesn't have the image stablization which is helpful for a lense with that range.  Also the focusing is loud and slow compared to the USM version of the same lense.  The extra battery included is an off brand and is super light.  Compared to the Canon battery that comes with the camera I doubt this battery weighs 1/3 or performs for very long at all.  The SDHC 16gb card that came with the bundle is only a class 2 (the lowest, new cards are class 10), which means transfer from the camera to the card is slow, extremely slowing down the rapid fire/burst function.  The 'high speed' card reader is junk.  The 1st time I used the reader to transfer images to my computer it corrupted the SD card and gave me a 'card access error.'  I lost all my photos!  I have since found out I could've taken the card to a local camera shop and they have a rescue program to restore corrupted cards (If I had only known before I accepted the loss of some great photos and formatted the card).  The camera bag is decent quality.  The tripod is super cheap and low quality.  The neck on the tripod will not stay up (no locking feature) and is wobbly.  First time using it with a light breeze outside and the tripod nearly blew over with my camera attached!  Luckily I caught it.All in all, I would NOT recommend this package even though I do recommend the camera.  I have since had to purchase a new class 10 SDHC card, new HQ tripod, and new high speed card reader.", "Date": "October 16, 2011"}, {"Title": "Great camera, kit not so great!", "Author": "nurseman21", "ReviewID": "R31ZNA01OVU5WD", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I love love love this camera, I am new to the dslr world, so am still finding my way around it, much easier thanks to an app on my iPad! The camera takes amazing pictures, and it feels quite durable as well! The shipping was so fast as well! My recommendation would be to buy the camera alone, rather than this kit, as the kit is very low quality, the bag I got was nothing near what was pictured, it came with 2-8gb sd cards, which are class 3, the cleaning kit was a cloth that looks like a dryer sheet, and a small pack of q-tips. The tripod is ok, but doesnt glide all that well when extending, and seems relatively cheap. It was nice to receive a spare battery, but those are available fairly cheap on amazon, so I would advise against spending any extra money on this kit.", "Date": "August 11, 2011"}, {"Title": "Awesome Camera But Beware the \"Kit\"", "Author": "BRC", "ReviewID": "R1J5Z2RB84MGS0", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "I purchased this kit as a gift to my wife who has wanted a Canon DSLR for a few years.  When the package arrived, the first thing I noticed was the advertised \"59 Inch Full Sized Tripod\" was actually only 50 inches.  Big deal, nine inches right?  But the point is, it's not what was advertised, nor what I paid for.  Also, the 16GB Vivitar memory card that came as part of the kit was defective.  It would not hold a format from neither the camera or nor our home computers.  The kit was also missing the advertised \"Jumpstart Guide to Digital SLR Cameras\".I contacted the seller, in this case Get It Digital, and left a voice mail to which I never received a call back.  I contacted Amazon and their stance was I could only return, not replace.  And oh by the way, it could take anywhere from one to three weeks for the money to be returned.  I spoke with my wife, who really wanted the camera and was willing to overlook the shorter tripod and missing manual, so I begrudgingly kept the product.  Once she used it we found out about the memory card issue.  So she bought another memory card from a local retailer and it works fine.The camera is incredible, takes great pictures and has many features.  The reason for my low review is for the kit, which is what's being offered.  Just beware and forewarned that you may not receive what you think you are buying.As a side-note, I left \"Seller Feedback\" and gave an honest account of my woes.  Only then was I contacted via email by the seller who at first wanted to send me all kinds of freebies so long as I deleted my feedback.  Once I told them I was standing by my feedback to warn potential consumers of my buying experience and was  not looking to gloss over my problems because they sent me some goodies, they became more aggressive and tried to put a spin on it that it was my fault for calling instead of emailing them.Again, the camera is a quality product that exceeds my expectations.  However, the kit was lacking and I would have been better off buying individual components.  Maybe it is different from other sellers and I just ran into a dud, but just wanted to share my experience.", "Date": "February 23, 2012"}, {"Title": "Misleading", "Author": "Lynn Small", "ReviewID": "R30NNID15BXN5G", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "The photo of the camera package with accessories offered clearly shows a camera bag.

I will not go into a review of the camera specifically, as there are plenty of amazon reviews and professional reviews that can talk about how great this camera is much better than I can.  DISCLAIMER:  I am not a professional photographer.  I am just like many of you folks deciding on your first DSLR upgrading from a point and shoot.  So take my opinions for what that is worth.Instead I will be going into some detail about the kit.  I bought my kit from Focus Camera.  The other sellers may have different kits, I am not sure.  All of the items came in their original retail packaging, like I picked them all out at the store myself.-The main item in the kit is of course the Cannon T3i.  It came brand new it its original retail box with all paperwork and accessories.  It did not come without a box or just wrapped in plastic like some other reviewers experienced with other sellers.  This camera is made in Taiwan.-The extra lens is an authentic Cannon EF 75-300 f/4-5.6 III and does not have the image stabilization or micro motor.  This lens retails by itself for $200 and alone makes this kit a good deal for beginners.  Like all the items in the kit, it came in its original retail packaging.  It is made in Malaysia.Canon EF 75-300mm f/4-5.6 III Telephoto Zoom Lens for Canon SLR Cameras-The 16 GB memory card is a Sony SF-16NX High Speed class 10 SDHC memory card.  It is not a particularly extra fast card, but does meet the class 10 specifications.  On the packaging, Sony claims it is recommended for HD video and continuous shooting for DSLR cameras, and I have not run into any issues.  Made in Taiwan.Sony SF16NX/TQM 16GB SDHC Class 10 Memory Card-The bag is a Vivitar Coco Series Gadget Bag.  It has plenty of room for the camera with kit lens attached, 75-300 lens, and extra accessories like the spare battery.  There is a well-padded main chamber with adjustable dividers, and three zippered pockets on the sides.  I am quite pleased with this bag, and am using it.  It is well padded and constructed.  It comes with a shoulder strap and a padded handle.  The Velcro on the inside could probably be a little better, but the price is sure right. Part # VIV-DC-59 and made in China.Vivitar Padded SLR Gadget Bag for SLR Cameras - Large-The tripod is a Vivtar of unknown model.  I tried searching for the exact model and could not find it.  It appears to be a Vivitar VPT1250 but 9 inches longer and all black.  The tripod folds out to be 49\", and then gains another 10\" from extending the neck all the way up.  I found that with the neck extended even a little, the camera became way too wobbly.  It feels stable enough at 49\".  It does not have an accessory/weight hook, and just uses rubber feet, no spikes.  The tripod is built extremely cheaply, and I don't know in what country (I assume China).  So far it is working fine for me.Vivitar VPT1250 50-Inch Tripod (Black/Silver)-The spare battery is a Xit Photo LP-E8 lithium battery.  It has a 1750 mAh rated capacity but feels lighter and cheaper than the Cannon 1120 mAh LP-E8 that comes with the camera.  I have no doubt the capacity is overstated, but seems to last about the same amount of time as the Cannon battery.  Part# XTLPE8 and made in China.Xit XTLPE8 1750mAh Lithium Ion Replacement Battery for Canon LP-E8 (Grey)-The lens cleaning kit is a focus camera 5pc kit that comes with a little bottle of fluid, blower brush, lens tissue, soft fiber cloth, and some cotton swabs.  It is plenty sufficient to get started.  Part# FC-CL5, China.-The kit includes a DVD, not a book.  It is from JumpStart Guides and is 60 minutes long.  It is titled \"Focus, Digital-SLR photography in a Snap\".  Same Focus brand as the lens kit.  I did not watch it as I purchased the book \"Canon EOS T3i/600D From Snapshots to Great Shots\" by Jeff Revell and absolutely love it.  From CanadaFocus Digital SLR Photography in a Snap Jumpstart Guide DVD-The wireless remote is a Zeikos ZE-WRC5 remote with no built in flashlight.  Small and cheap but works fine. Make sure to turn off auto focus and turn off auto-off to get the remote to work. ChinaZeikos ZE-WRC5 Wireless Remote for Canon-The screen protector is a Zeikos universal screen guard.  It comes with three 3\"x5\" protectors that you have to cut to fit, plus a squeegee card.  Works fine, but hard to apply without getting bubbles like most guards . Part# ZE-SG26R, ChinaZeikos ZE-SG26 Set of 3 Screen Protectors (3 x 5-Inches)-The card reader is a Xtreme multi card reader/writer usb 2.0 stick.  It has three slots in it and supports SD/SDHC/microSD/MS Pro Duo,M2 cards.  Part #32599 made in ChinaXtreme 32588 USB Memory Card Reader-The memory card wallet is a black Vivitar VIV-MW-003 three card wallet made of durable nylon and fake leather.  Holds three cards, basic and acceptable. China-The 6 foot HDMI cable is a mini hdmi to reguluar hdmi cable.  Generic of unknown brand, but well made.This kit is good for beginners.  None of it is professional quality but the kit works fine.  With the information I have provided, you can now research the individual items to decide if this kit is right for you.  Most of the items are sold individually here on amazon, so just copy the name or part number of the item and you can read reviews about them.  I am glad I went with the kit as I am a casual user that has no need for the more expensive stuff.  I would recommend this to anybody entering the DSLR world.  I think the 75-300 lens, which I was going to buy anyway, makes this kit worth it.  It is almost like if you bought the 75-300 lens, and then got a whole bunch of cheap but useful free stuff with it.", "Date": "June 22, 2013"}, {"Title": "Piece of junk kit", "Author": "alice", "ReviewID": "R3P2DHQ108YHYV", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I'm a photographer, and I bought this for my niece, everything is very cheap quality, the camera seems fine but makes me insecure and question the authenticity since every single piece on the kit is junk.

I have been happy with the long battery life (capable of several hundred photos), and the tilt-out screen is awesome for over-the-head or from-the-ground shots.  Photos are superb, and the auto ISO feature is handy and accurate.  The auto settings do have a tendency to white out the sky sometimes, but can be corrected manually or during processing.  I haven't tried the video yet.  Overall I have been very satisfied so far.  The complete package is pretty much everything an amateur needs to get started.

I bought this bundle less than a week ago and in that time, Amazon has switched the store offering this deal 3 times (first Beach Camera, then Focus Camera, and now 47th Street Photo).Secondly, the camera itself is great. If you're here, you've probably decided that you're going with the Canon Rebel T3i, and frankly, it's simply an amazing camera for any beginner. So 5 stars for Canon here.Thirdly, if you are buying the bundle, think about this for a minute: Is it worth buying this bundle from a 3rd-party retailer? Are you really going to use the specific accessories included in this bundle? (You can find the T3i + 18-55mm lens + 75mm-300mm lens bundles for $699 from most big-name retailers, i.e. BestBuy).Now in regards to what is included in the bundle: overall, the quality of the non-Canon accessories, is generally terrible.What was (supposed) to be included in my bundle:Canon Brand Accessories:  - 75MM - 300MM LENS: Very nice beginner lens. Feels nice and heavy (made of high quality) and has allowed me to shoot subjects (mostly birds) at a distance.3rd Party Accessories:  - A 16 GB SD CARD: (Did not arrive with my package! I had to contact BeachCamera and Amazon separately in order to be refunded for the value of the SD card. This was very disappointing)  - A TRIPOD: (mine was by the brand 'Pro Series'); this tripod was far from a 'pro' level tripod. It was extremely, extremely, extremely flimsy, and after opening it and trying it once, I decided it wasn't worth using again.  - EXTRA BATTERY: Of an unknown brand. Like everyone else has noted, it feels considerably lighter than Canon's own included battery, but it's not a bad additional battery. The battery life is only slightly shorter than Canon's battery. So this was essentially a solid backup battery.  - BAG (Digital Concepts brand): The bag I received was made by a company called Digital Concepts, but other reviewers have reported getting different bags (probably each vendor uses a different bag). The bag is pretty lousy; it completely lacks any compartments, and has no pockets of any kind as well. This bag normally isn't even sold online (I tried searching for it). It feels flimsy and really should be reinforced more. Size wise it's pretty portable at 11\" x 6\" x 6\"; it can hold all of the accessories in this bundle, with the exception of the tripod. If you weren't carrying around accessories, you could house the DSLR body + 4 lenses. If you truly feel you don't need a 'strong' case for the DSLR, then you'll probably be okay with case, but this is an accessory I've already replaced with a new bag.  - Zeikos ZE-FLK55 55mm Multi-Coated 3 Piece Filter Kit (UV-CPL-FLD) (Zeikos brand): These filters are actually pretty awesome. There are 3 filters included(a UV filter for lens protection/sun, a CP filter for glare minimization, & a FLD filter for white balance correction). Let's note that they fit on both of the lenses included in this package, and that the retail value for these filters is a miserly $7.17 as of this review. They don't really do much to your image, but most photographers recommend that lens filters act as a good lens protector when in use. The lens filters also come with a small carrying pouch made of leather. This pouch is a great addition.  - WIRELESS REMOTE (Zeikos brand): I personally feel this is essentially a useless accessory for any beginner (such as myself). I haven't really used it, but it appears to be cheaply made. Nevertheless, it does include a 5 year warranty, which speaks to the quality of Zeikos.  - SD CARD HOLDER: Made of some type of cheap leather; it's an SD card holder...it gets the job done simply put.  - 3 PIECE DELUXE CLEANING KIT (Zeikos brand): The '3 pieces' are 5 Q-tips, a lens cleaning solution, and a soft cloth (similar to the ones used to clean pairs of glasses). It's a cheap kit...but the solution is a quick-evaporating mix that works fairly well. Too bad that with frequent use, this kit wouldn't last very long...  - HDMI CABLE: This is a very high quality cable...feels and looks strong and durable.  - LCD PROTECTORS: Comes with 3 LCD protectors; the LCD screen on the T3i folds inwards (it's a swivel screen) after use to protect the screen, so I never bothered installing these.  - 25 FREE PRINTS: Never received these...didn't bother to tell Amazon, because I figured I wouldn't use them.  - DVD GUIDE (Focus Brand): Never received this either...didn't really care.***OVERALL***: I ordered from Beach Camera and was missing 3 items (the SD Card, 25 free prints and DVD guide). Overall, I felt that the packaged goods that accompany the camera are lousy. I ended up replacing the carrying case and SD card anyway, and the ~$8.00 lens filters are the only accessory I truly use from this bundle. If I could do it over, I would've just bought the camera with the 2 lenses WITHOUT this bundle.", "Date": "July 23, 2013"}, {"Title": "Missing items and Poor Service", "Author": "Lon E.", "ReviewID": "R1HOC61YT5J2SZ", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "I am writing this review here because I can get NO response from Amazon on my purchase from them, in conjunction with Beach Camera.

I contacted Amazon regarding these missing items and was told although this kit was put together and sent by Amazon, they were out of stock and that they could not send me a replacement kit.  I asked if they could simply send me the four missing items instead of replacing the entire kit and I was told they can't do that.  I was disappointed because I absolutely love the camera and wanted to keep it.  I finally contacted Focus Camera and explained the situation, that I didn't want my money back or have to return the camera, I just wanted the four missing items that I paid for.  The Focus Camera rep I dealt with assured me she understood my situation and told me they wanted to work with me to remedy the situation.  The rep. offered to ship me the four missing items with no strings attached.  I got my shipment two days after it was shipped out.  They even provided me with tracking info so I can follow up.  Like I said, I absolutely love this camera but after this incident, I absolutely appreciated the level of customer service I had with Focus Camera.  I will definitely purchase future camera/camera kit(s) from them.  I highly recommend them to anyone looking to purchase a camera or camera kit.", "Date": "May 1, 2014"}, {"Title": "If you are a beginner, then this kit is for you!", "Author": "Will", "ReviewID": "R1ZE3XRHIA7TG3", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "There are several negative reviews here about the \"kit\".  I am just beginning photography as a hobby, read some reviews on good starting cameras, found my way to the Canon T3i, then my way to Amazon, and eventually this kit... if that sounds like you, then you you are like me, and this review may just be for you.I think a lot of people are being way too harsh on this kit. I think it is a GREAT kit, and absolutely everything I need to get started. Personally, I don't see me \"upgrading\" any of these items for quite some time.-The bag is perfect, with shoulder strap, pockets all around, room to grow into, weather protecting flaps for the pockets (so water doesn't seep into the zipper).-The tripod is like any other generic tripod I have ever seen, with a nice shoulder-strapped bag. It is 100% capable of holding a camera still for delicate shots with both the lenses that came with it.  Are $600 tripods better?  sure, but this one is free... not sure why all the hate for it.-The kit also comes with a Sony (yes Sony) high-speed (40 mb/s, which is fast) SD card... and that is way nicer then I expected. It also comes with a USB to SD-card adapter for your computer, which is pretty useful for quick and easy transferring of photos to your computer.- The directional DVD is about 1 hour long and offers some great tips for getting started and maintaining the camera.- Back-up battery is just that... a back-up... it works.- The camera and both lenses are AMAZING... I just went in my back yard and shot a picture of an un-blossomed flower sprouting and my wife is already asking if we can put it on the wall.- The cleaning kit comes with enough supply to get started and gave me a good idea of things I will need to \"resupply\" down the road.- The remote is the only \"cheapy\" item in my book, but it does work, and with care won't need to be replaced any time soon.Overall, there are a lot of negative reviews suggesting you get the camera and lenses, then go buy all these things separately. If you do the math, you are saving hundreds of dollars with this kit... I would recommend buying this kit, then be happy... or if you have that extra hundreds of dollars, then buy more lenses (like the 55mm f/1.8) because this is absolutely a serviceable kit.

I've always been a point and shoot camera person, so you can probably imagine the over whelming feeling when I pulled that T3i out of the box and saw all those buttons. This is my first camera that I can control the lens on so I'm looking forward to lots of fun and a new learning experience. I read a lot of the reviews while I was waiting for my package to arrive. After a bout the fifth one. I began to see a lot of the same thing. I'd like to address some of those. First of in a package like this one people don't realize that in reality the 11 pc bundle is not going to be something to write home to mother about and knit picking it apart only makes you look confused. I mean think about it what did you buy the camera or the 11 pc bundle.That bundle is a beginners bundle to get you started. and while I will admit that the tripod is made of plastic and not very well it does have something that I've only seen on the more expensive tripods and that it the quick release mount on the top. and so what if the 16 gig card isn't top of the line or the cleaning kit has q-tips with it. big whoop, I'm still trying to figure out what that TV/flashlight is for..lolevery body complained about the fact that the gadget bag was poorly made.well I looked the one over that cam with mine and its not the greatest bag but it holds all my gear and than some. and yes at a later date i will be buying a canon bag. I mean common now its a canon camera so I thing putting it in the proper bag would only be fair.I've taken several photos with it already. nothing I want to share just test photo to see what they will look like and try out the play back feature on the camera. tomorrow I put my T3i to the real test sun up to sun down and a whole lot of shooting in between. In all honesty I feel I got what I paid for. My biggest complaint would have to go to Fedex the people that handled the shipping. They left the box everything came in right on the door so that when I opened the door I knocked the box over on the porch. they didn't knock, ring the bell or acknowledge they had even been there.

I'm no photographer, I'm 13 but I can tell you this is worth buying! The amount of things it comes with is a big plus! I use the case all the time! If I'm not usingthe camera, it's in the case! The tripod I use ALOT too! It's great for steady shots, and if you want to be on the picture and you don't trust anyone else to touch it (me...) then it comes with a wireless remote, it isn't the best and I recommend getting a better one or a wired one but it's still better than nothing! I don regret buying this at all! For beginning my photography class and doing nice far away and close ups this camera is great! It also came with the exact two lenses I wanted, 18-55mm and 75-300mm!!!!! I love taking close ups from a distance and that second lense (75-300mm) had it all! Beginners like me, looking for a \"pre-professional\" camera get this one! ( I also got a 3 year warranty for my clumsynes just in case...

In fact, everything except the tripod and remote is above expectation. And I may change my opinion on the remote if I can ever figure out how to use it. Should be simple, right? Read the remote instructions. Well, the remote is for controlling a TV, so it's instructions tell you how to do that. No help. Read the camera's manual. All it tells you to do is put the camera in timer/remote mode. Check. Nothing happens. Okay, ask for help here, and through the seller (Focus Camera) as well. Got some responses here, but none have really gotten me any closer to actually using the remote. Focus Camera's response, and I kid you not, was \"ask Amazon\". Really?I had read that some folks received a cheap memory card, but I received a Sony 16GB Class 10 card. No complaints. The bag is a Vivitar bag that holds everything except the tripod, and believe me, you won't care because the tripod is so cheaply made you'll want to replace it.Like I said, the kit is still worth the price of $649 considering the camera and two lenses at Wally World will set you back around$800.

It takes amazing shots and is a great beginner to intermediate class camera.  The supplied lenses allow for a good range of shooting preferences.  Beware no stabilization on the 300mm lens.  You can go many places and read long and well thought out reviews on the camera itself so I won't bother to do that here.  It's a well known and generally well liked unit.  That being said, the remainder of this package is what I'll focus on.  If you ended up looking a this package because it includes so many accessories in one buy, rethink that decision.  You can buy much better accessories for the price.  The bag is below average.  It's very flimsy and mine came with one zipper compartment already broken (zipper didn't work).  It does have a decent divider inside and the thickness is ok to protect the camera.  The card reader is also below average and unable to read my high speed SD XC cards.  It reads the supplied card just fine, but that's another matter..  The supplied card is an SD HC.  At 16 gig, it won't take too long to fill that up and also is slower than my preference of an SD XC card, which is the best choice if you want to take hi def video.  The miniature remote, which I suppose can be used to control the shutter remotely, is at best a three dollar item.  The tripod is lightweight, which is good for portability, but besides that, is average to below average in functionality.  I've not had a chance to put the additional battery to the test as the supplied battery with the camera is simply amazing and seems to last forever.  To sum it up, if you're looking to buy this camera, buy the camera and not this bundle.  Then go buy quality accessories that you want.  I wish I would have done that.", "Date": "January 14, 2014"}, {"Title": "Great", "Author": "michael trimble", "ReviewID": "RT4Q0V8JNJST2", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Outstanding camera.

It doesn't have an auto stabilizer which makes it necessary to have it on a tripod when shooting.  Again, I am totally unfamiliar with these cameras, so maybe that's standard.

I couldn't be more happy with it.  This is my first SLR camera and I have zero experience with still photography.First, you will NOT find a better price anywhere.  After receiving my bundle, I went to best buy to compare and verify the deal and I have to say I was surprised as I was relieved...  Here are the prices from Best Buy.$599.99  Canon EOS Rebel T3i$199.99 Canon EF 75-300 Zoom LensAlready saved $100 right there, but it doesn't stop with that...$15.00  Extra battery$30.00  Wireless Remote$35.00  16 or 32 GB HD SD Card (I picked up a 32 on sale but camera comes with 16)$10.00  UV Filter$20.00  Circular Polarized Filter$20.00  Florescent Light Filter$10.00  LCD cut to size screen protector packI'm not sure if the instructional DVD is included with the camera at Best Buy, but I saw the exact same DVD for sale on its own for $30.00.  The Tri-pod and carry case are crap / cheap and will need to be replaced so I give them $0 value, but hey they do work and you can use them until you save up to buy better ones.  I bought a real nice back pack case for $40.So not even including the cheap case and tripod there's an extra $140 in accessories.  So all in all this bundle saves you $240 over buying in retail at Best Buy.Now for the camera... WOW what a lot of fun.  Spent the entire paswt weekend in my back yard taking pictures of everything I could think of in manual mode.  I watched some youtube videos on how to use an SLR and I'm finding it a fun challenge.  I spent my Sunday out on the front lawn practicing taking pics of passing car license plates.  Within an hour I noticed a huge improvement in my focus ability as well as speed.  Like anything in this world, if you wanna be good at something you got to practice.  I would not suggest using this camera for the first time at your daughter's wedding.  Practice before you need it.  After a few days of using the manual mode I tried the Automatic and found it worked pretty good.  Pictures were taken super fast and the automatic settings were spot on in some cases.  My goal is to learn how to use it on manual 24/7.The built in flash is nice.  Provides a lot of light but from what I've been told, I will probably end up buying an external down the road when my skills improve.  But for simple party / dinner time use, the flash works great for me.The camera battery life is also very good.  I think I took upwards of 1,000 pictures on a single charge.  Over the weekend I only replaced the battery pack once.  I will say I did not spend much time reviewing the pictures on the LCD.In conclusion, as my first DSLR I couldn't be more happy with this Canon T3i and the bundle here on amazon.com.  In just the first hour I was taking some of the best pictures I have ever taken on any camera I have ever had before.  With all the accessories and things to add onto the camera in addition to an overwhelming (at this time) number of options and settings on the camera... I believe the camera will be all I ever need as an amateur / recreational photographer.I highly recommend the camera to anyone.  I also highly suggest that you practice, practice and practice.  \"RTFM\"  Read The %&*@? Manual and/or watch the DVD and/or watch youtube.  I had 2 co-workers try and talk me out of purchasing an SLR due to their poor experiences, thank god I did not listen.

Straight out of the box this camera took awesome pictures. I still don't know a lot about what this camera can actually do but that will come in time. I can't imagine it would take any better pictures than it does right now. I'm literally still in awe over the clarity and quality of pictures it takes. If you're like me and have been using a point and shoot camera but want something more where you won't have to miss those special moments, then this is the camera for you. Easy to use straight out of the box. I bought the combo kit that has a bag, memory card,, tripod, extra battery, 2 lenses with it and a few other things I have forgot and they're not with me at the moment. It has everything you need to start taking good, quality pictures. First of all, I read several reviews that said the bag was worthless. I honestly can't find anything wrong with it. I bought another case just based on those reviews. New case is great but just a tad smaller. Both are very sturdy.People have been complaining about the extra battery not being make by Canon. Yes the battery feels lightweight compared to the Canon but it lasted every bit as long as the canon battery did. I put the generic battery in and was able to take around 400+ shots without changing it. And that was with me playing with it a lot, like changing focus, continuous shot shooting, and lots of time viewing my pictures.Haven't used the tripod yet but will when I get home. I've read it was plastic and won't hold up well. I'll update my review when I do.Transferring pictures using the software provided is very easy. Love what you can do with the pictures to make them have special effects. There is something that came with the kit that allows you to remove the memory card, place the card into this thing and plug it into your computer. I'm sure it will be great for transferring pictures. Just haven't tried it yet. I've only used the transfer cable that came with it. It works great and pictures transfer quickly.I've only had my camera for about I week now and still love what it does. Hopefully, if I don't forget, I will update again when it's been six months.Well, hope this will help someone who is looking to buy a good camera to make a more educated decision. Can't wait to try it out on the grandkids now.

The auto exposure and auto focus both work well.  If you just want to do point and shoot photography when you unpack the camera; that is possible too.  The camera also has the full capabilities required for either auto or user controlled portrait work, still life, sports, landscape, and telephoto wild life photos.  I especially like the feature that allows you to get the camera to calculate the required amount of flash to prevent the over exposure of flash photos.  You can purchase nice to have items on line at low cost.  An infra red remote control ($6) allows you to pose with the family and take the picture.  A hand held flash can trigger the camera and onboard pop up flash for portrait work.  A hand held remote shutter switch ($6) plugs into the camera for tripod and telephoto work.  This package is assembled by the seller and you may be able to change some of the items for a small price increase.  The generic bag is a little tight for the camera and telephoto lens.  The tripod is light, but seems stable when weighted with the camera bag.  The 16GB memory card is an average speed and adequate for many still photos, but it should be downloaded after each day of active work.  I purchased a SanDisk Extreme SDXC 64GB memory card on line for $65.  The 45MB/sec recording speed allows more frames/second when shooting multi-shot motion.  You may be able to get the seller to upgrade the memory card for a small price increase.  The stabilized 18-55mm lens does seem to neutralize camera shake, but the 75-300mm lens in this package is not stabilized.  You may be able to get a stabilized telephoto lens if you want that feature.  However, the Canon EOS lenses are quite expensive, and they are the only ones that will work with the auto functions of the EOS camera.  Even the Canon 2X tele extender with EOS contacts costs $300, while a similar T2 mounted 2X extender without the EOS contacts costs $20.", "Date": "February 24, 2013"}, {"Title": "LOVE this camera!", "Author": "Melanie", "ReviewID": "R14POI063B4CQG", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I bought this camera based on user reviews, and I LOVE it!!!

Overall, while the camera quality is good enough, for the price and the weight of carrying this camera around, I do not feel it was our best purchase.  We should have gone with a smaller camera (less expensive and less weight to carry around.  We needed a smaller camera, same quality of photo or thereabouts due to size, for less $$.

Between the bag, tripod and extra battery it is just what I needed for on location shooting.I would suggest however either buying an extra set of batteries, and the battery grip for the unit.Also, the SD card is not made for taking video, you need to get a different SD card like the Transcend Class 10 SD card to be able to save video. Otherwise it will stop recording after about 11 seconds on the card that comes with the package.Overall happy with the pack and great seller.", "Date": "October 7, 2011"}, {"Title": "good", "Author": "worth a deal", "ReviewID": "R3IJ0OEV7KV4IX", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "It was a good deal, got bunch of accessories all worth using.

The overall package was not too bad. Others commented on not getting the full 16gb memory card, but mine did, also I read that someWere missing some items but I actually got every item, and it's a great starter kit. The tripod looks as if it may get bent up easily, but it's a great starter. The 2 lenses are great and I couldn't be happier with my purchase!
