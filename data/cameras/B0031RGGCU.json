If I could, I would give it 3 1/2 stars.  It has nice features like 14 mega pixels (which isn't necessarily better) and a really nice 3 inch screen.  It is lacking any good manual settings, so if you're into having those this wouldn't be a good camera for you.  It does take HD video which is nice.  I definitely wasn't blown away with image quality either.  Sometimes I will get an amazing picture with beautiful colors, and other times most of the pics I will get are blurry.  I have noticed that this camera is really bad at capturing a crisp image in overcast outdoor lighting.  Overall this is best for the person who wants a casual camera for taking nice pictures of family events and people.  Especially because it has a cool feature called face RECOGNIZATION in addition to face detection.  The recognization part comes in when you can tag someones face in a pic, and it will recognize that same face in other pics and put all pics of that same person into their own folder on the camera.

The colors in the pictures are brilliant and true. One great feature of this camera is its ability to take pictures is quick successions, there is very little wait time between shots...id say 1 sec compared to some sony and cannon cameras that ive researched which are like 3-4 secs.The HD video recording is smooth and beautiful. Night shots are clear and smooth with the lightening bright flash. 14MP well its 14MP I don't need to say more about that.The battery life could be a bit better and the onscreen menu is a bit tricky to navigate but its a small price to pay for the overall great performance of this camera!!!!", "Date": "August 10, 2010"}, {"Title": "Good camera, great value", "Author": "Sam", "ReviewID": "RHG2GZJT0WE05", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I was looking for a new camera to replace an older Fuji model that I was using a rubberband on to hold the battery door closed. I choose the Kodak M575 for a couple of reasons first it had all the features in fact most of them I haven't even tried yet but they're there when I want them and the price I paid was excellent, under a $100 dollars. Since getting the camera I have been doing some experimenting and there is a learning curve with any new device but for the most part this Kodak is simple to use and produces good results. Even the video is passable given that was not why I bought the camera I was pleasently surprised by the quality. The camera was discounted because it was the black model so unless you can't live without a purple camera save yourself a few bucks the picture quality is the same.", "Date": "October 5, 2010"}, {"Title": "Excellent Kodak Kamera", "Author": "G. Max Gooding", "ReviewID": "R218GAXHWJ6S3M", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Introduction:Previously to getting this camera, I had some Sony cameras that ended up giving me some trouble, so I decided to make a brand switch. Kodak has been in the photography business for years and is a well trusted name. In fact the trade name Kodak was registered in the year 1888. Subsequently, the Eastman Kodak company was registed in 1892. Why is this so important? When buying a camera, reliability is important, especially if you travel to distant locations where you may want to capture a once in a lifetime experiences on your camera. The last thing you want is for your camera to konk out on you when you most need it.The M575:This is a feature rich camera, and has all that you need to capture and share your pictures easily and effortlessly. I have found these cameras to be defect free and to perform as per specifications. What I found to be unique about this camera is that you can tag your pictures so that you can find your subjects easily.Here are a few notes that may help you in your purchasing decision:- No software is included, you will need to download it yourself, the web site is given inside the manual.- The Camera has 5X optical zoom, but no digital zoom, which is really OK, since you can digitally zoom your pictures if you really want to on your computer.- Also in the manual is a web address that gives a lot of information, topics covered include: battery management, lens maintenance, minor repairs and firmware upgrades.The place where I purchased my Camera, I also found in the package the following:- a Kodak Camera Case- a 2GB SD Kingston Memory CardSo, I recommend that you check what you actually get in the box before buying additional memory, or a camera case.This product works properly and it is well supported, so that if you run into problems there is abundant support so that you can make the most of your camera investment. And remember, smile, it's Kodak.", "Date": "December 26, 2010"}, {"Title": "Great quailty", "Author": "Ken staten", "ReviewID": "R3NCH3QD4OS9W8", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Took this to my family reunion on the 3-4 of July.Everyone was amazed at the picture quality.Had more people use my camera than there own,14 MP makes a big difference.", "Date": "July 14, 2010"}, {"Title": "Great point & shoot", "Author": "M.

I usually do alot of research on a product before I purchase it, but I did not have the time to do that with this camera. The pictures usually come out blurry, the low light level is terrible and it takes along time between pictures. So, if you want to get alot of photos of something quick, forget about it. The absolute worst thing is unless you are taking a still photo, like landscape, chances are you will not get the picture that you thought you took. When you push the button to take a photo, it seems to take 4 seconds before the actual picture is taken. I can't tell you how many times I have taken a picture of something, and I didn't get it because the speed of the camera is so slow.  I get a picture of something that happened 4 seconds after the picture I wanted. It was my grandson's first birthday and most of the pictures are blurry. I missed alot of the funny faces and expressions he made because the camera takes so long to take a picture. I'm so disappointed. Another thing I noticed, is the few pictures I have printed with this camera came out darker and with much less definition than my old camera. I also miss not having a view finder, but I knew that when I bought it. The camera stinks, so don't buy it.

It has many Pro's, and the few Con's are: (1) You have to push a few buttons before you start to record a movie. I previously had a Casio Exilim Card camera and all it took was the push of a single button and the movie recording would start, which I really liked.  We have a small child and you have to be quick or the moment is gone. (2) I am not into social networks and the whole share button function is somewhat overrated and annoying to me, but the red button is also easy to ignore. (3) You have to download Kodak software to get your images transferred to the PC and I would prefer it if the camera would just appear as an external USB drive. (4) The USB cable port is covered with a flimsy rubber cap and it will probably rip off some day.But like I said, all in all the camera works well, it's easy to use, feels good and solid, takes great photos and great HD videos, and the shutter lag is minimal which I really like a lot. The 5x Zoom is also nice and the LCD screen is quite large.

I attributed the quality of the pictures in the V550 to the Schneider-Kreuznach lens. When I saw that the M575 had a Schneider-Kreuznach lens with optical zoom, I was optimistic that I had found a replacement for the discontinued V550. I've used the camera now under a number of different conditions and have not seen the picture clarity I was hoping for. First, it is difficult to get the camera to take a distance shot under low light conditions. I kept ending up with blurry shots because the autofocus kept defaulting to close-up. But even when I got the focus settings to match what I was photographing, the picture clarity was pretty poor. Contributing to this is the poor design of the camera buttons. They're not easy to distinguish by touch, making it hard to get take even the mediocre shots the camera produces.

The camera was a nightmare. The Nikon replaced an older Kodak EasyShare and it was a great camera for a great price and this new Kodak has lived up to its predecessor.  Bottom line, we paid the price by going with something other than an EasyShare. Kodak makes a great camera and we probably won't buy any other camera again.  We always give out custom family calendars to our parents as Christmas gifts and the low quality images from cameras of our brothers and sisters always seem to \"ruin\" our good calendar picture sets. This camera has never failed us and works seamlessly with both our Mac and PC. Great camera.  iPHOTO users!! Just a happy little note about this one, when you import these to iPhoto (and other photo software setups as well), the camera AUTOMATICALLY rotates and orients portrait and landscape photos correctly. There is no need to rotate pics that were taken with the camera sideways... This may seem insignificant but our Nikon didn't do this and it was a headache.

The optical zoom is great (5X) - that's hard to find in a small, affordable camera.", "Date": "December 9, 2010"}, {"Title": "Stay away from this prodect", "Author": "carnirel", "ReviewID": "R3SSI2KITNPY5T", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I was warned not to purchase a camera with a special battery, but it was a gift, so I thought maybe it won't be too bad..Barely 6 months later, the battery started to go and when I contacted the company, they made suggestions like don't use the flash and keep it out of the cold..This camera was moderately used, the battery shouldn't be going bad already and I am not spending 30 plus dollars to replace it..I rather go back to rechargeable AA batteries that my previous camera had, it last for years....", "Date": "July 12, 2011"}, {"Title": "Pretty disappointed", "Author": "kg", "ReviewID": "R1F0FPEBZ8JM8B", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "I am pretty disappointed in this camera overall.  It took me a while to begin taking pictures with it, which ruined my chances of returning the item, as I would have, had I known how horrible the pics would turn out.Each time I have used it, 80% of the pictures came out grainy and blurry.  I have tried different settings but cannot find one that makes much of a difference.The worst part is the fact that it defaults to Smart Capture when you turn it off/on.  So even if I were to find a setting I liked, I would have to reset it each time I turn the camera back on.So sad that it is only my second digital camera, and the first one took FAR better pictures (Sony), and was cheaper as well.I guess I will stick with Sony or another brand.  Problem is I went by the reviews on this site, and it actually gets pretty good ones.  So much for that.  I would try to sell it on Ebay, but wouldn't want to do that to someone else.

Sound like expect a lot -think I paid $96-I work hard for my money and i do expect a lot for it.
