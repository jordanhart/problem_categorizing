{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Made a Believer Out of Me...", "Author": "Vladimir Ratner \"vratner\"", "ReviewID": "R3N7DFEX09OSA4", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "If you read my Kodak V530 review, then you already know what I am talking about.  If not, then I'll give you a quick overview:Last week I sold my Canon S230 camera (similar to SD200), which served me well for about 3 years, and was looking for a replacement.  The following criteria were most important to me: price, quality, and reliability.  Also, I want to mention that I have some professional photography experience.  I used to work for Kodak for a couple of years in Professional Digital Imaging department, doing some software testing.  I don't consider myself to be a Pro, but I do know what I'm talking about when it comes to cameras, and digital cameras/photography in particular.  Back to cameras - I didn't want to buy another Canon, because I think they are overrated and overpriced.  I like Sony - I think their video equipment is one of the best on the market, but unfortunately the same doesn't apply to their digital cameras.  So, using specific parameters/criteria I've narrowed down my search to a few brands/models: Kodak V530/V550, Panasonic FX8/FX9, and Casio S600/Z600/Z60 (I was also looking at Z750 and Z850).  Kodak turned out to be a waste of my time - two days after I bought it, I took it back to Walmart (thanks to their great return policy - no restocking fees or anything else).  After that I wasn't even going to try V550.  Panasonic uses Leica lenses, and I wish I could try it, but unfortunately it is not sold anywhere locally, and I didn't want to buy it online, because if I didn't like and wanted to return it, I would end up paying restocking fees.So, I went back to Walmart, and there it was, sitting on the shelf, Casio Exilim EX-Z60.  Pretty in silver.  I've read/heard a lot of good things about Casio digital cameras, but was always leery to try one myself, mainly because of the reliability fact.  But since Walmart has such a nice return policy, I went ahead and bought it anyway.  I was in for a treat - this camera turned out to be a truly pleasant surprise.  I've been using it for a few days now and it just keeps on amazing me.  In a few more days I will have to take it back to Walmart, but not because I don't like it, but because I bought myself a Z600 (it's coming in the mail), which I wouldn't have before I tried this one.  In my review I will give you a full analysis of the Z60 model, and then I will tell you why I chose to go with the Z600, as well as I will compare it to S600, Z750, and Z850.Pros:Design - Simple, yet elegant.  Very clean, modern look.  Available in Silver, Black, and I believe also in Red.  I am not sure what other colors look like, but silver looks really nice.  It's brushed, not polished, which in my opinion is better, since it doesn't scratch as easily.  Buttons seem to be in the right places.  Overall, a very sexy looking camera.Price - Comparing to other brands in the same range, it's on a low side.  Walmart had it for just under $250.  I think you can buy it cheaper online for about $220-230, which is a great deal for a 6MP digital camera of this caliber.Picture Quality - Holy cow!!!  Wow!!! Those were my first words when I took first few shots.  I have not seen anything like this.  It put my Canon to shame! Have you heard of an expression \"Picture Perfect\"?!  This was certainly the case.  The pictures looked bright, bold, and crisp.  Ready to be published/printed in any magazine or to be placed in a frame and hanged on a wall.  Simply brilliant!  What I also liked is that how \"true\" the colors were, meaning that whatever was red in real life, appeared red in a picture - not pink, or orange, or any other color.  Not many cameras are capable of that - most of them will \"distort\" the color somehow.Features - For an ultra compact P&S; digital camera, it is packed with various features.  Menus, buttons all seem to be in the right places and are very easy to operate without previous knowledge.  Large 2.5\" LCD (display); 33 shooting modes (including EBay mode, where the pictures are specifically optimized for selling items on EBay - my wife was thrilled about that); Anti Shake DSP (stabilization control for those with shaky hands to minimize the blurriness in pictures); and many more.  Great job, Casio!!!Battery Life - I spent a full day before I had to recharge the battery.  With this one, you will probably never need a backup battery.Cons:I simply cannot say that I don't like something in particular about this camera.  Perhaps reliability is my biggest concern.  Will this camera be \"true\" to me, just like Canon was for 3 years, or will it break after a couple of months - only time will show... but for now, I am a happy camper.Summary:Whichever one you choose, Z60 or Z600, any one will be a great choice!  But it now!!!Now that I've given you a somewhat full description/analysis of a Z60, I will have to say why I chose to go with a Z600 (which I will review as soon as I get my hands on it).  But before I do that, I will also mention that I considered buying a Z750, Z850, and an S600.  So, why didn't I?  Well, I did my research first.  Both Z750 and Z850 are not true P&S; cameras - they are more for someone who wants a bit more of a manual control.  From what I hear, they are great cameras, but unless you have some knowledge in professional photography, or want to learn more about it, it's not worth buying it.  They also have a few problems that haven't been addressed yet by Casio, and they are also a bit pricy for an average consumer.  S600 on the other hand is another true P&S; camera, with some great features.  For one, it takes movies (video) in MPEG-4 format, comparing to Z60 and Z600's AVI.  How is it different?  Because it's a better quality format, and you can also store of up to 5 times more.  Not bad, ah?!  It also looks way too cool.  Casio even calls it a Card Camera - it looks and feels like a credit card, that's how compact it is.  So, why didn't I buy an S600 then?  Well, first of all it's more expensive than a Z600.  But most importantly it lacks a few features (such as EBay mode for example), and also has only a 2.2\" LCD, comparing to 2.5\" on a Z60, and a huge bright 2.7\" on a Z600.  There you have it.  The Z60 and Z600 are practically identical, except for the LCD size.  Price difference was not very significant (Z600 probably $20 more), but I figured the larger display is well worth it.  Also, Z600 is a bit smaller, and weighs a little less as well.Once again, I am very impressed with Casio, and highly recommend it to everyone.", "Date": "April 28, 2006"}, {"Title": "Awesome tiny camera", "Author": "PM \"pam999\"", "ReviewID": "R2U27WL2YMYT1F", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This is the smallest of the credit card size cameras on the market today - feature-wise the Sony is the next runner up but size-wise it is wider than this Casio.  I did quite a bit of research before buying this camera because I already had a perfectly fine small digital Canon but I wanted a \"credit card\" sized one for trips and conversely for black tie events so I could slip it into a tiny purse.  I'm not disappointed.  The Casio S600 costs $100 more and that's cuz it makes MPEG movies but since many programs call for AVI and since I already have a couple mini-DV movie cameras that feature was not worth the extra money to me.  For $249 this camera is a gem.  On my recent trip to China many people saw me using it and were blown away.  The LCD screen is quite large and the battery life is incredible - lasting for days, hundreds of pictures and abusive LCD viewing!  I used the 6mp quality setting and don't know why anyone would complain about the image - it looks great. The picture taking is instant without that dreaded delay of most digital cameras. If the camera doesn't have time to auto-focus it shows a red square and then you need to half click down again until it locks into focus (green square), but usually it catches the focus right away.  The only thing I wish is that it had a view-finder for those days when the sun is glaring and you can't see the LCD but I found that none of the tiny cameras have view-finders so I guess that's the trade-off to get a tiny camera. I highly recommend this camera.", "Date": "June 7, 2006"}, {"Title": "Z60 vs. S500", "Author": "Victor A.

The cool factor on this camera is so high it's crazy, every time I whip that camera out, people are saying, \"what is that!\" Of course picture quality is not going to be the same as a $1000 Contax or Leica, but the pictures are very good and most of us are not photo editors that would really notice some miniscule imperfection.  I just want something that's tiny, so I can take it anywhere, durable, fun and takes \"good\" pictures, and this is it.  When I got mine, it was $300, now you can find them for 2 and it'll be well worth it. 4 stars from me.", "Date": "June 13, 2006"}, {"Title": "Great, Compact yet Powerful Camera", "Author": "Randy Young", "ReviewID": "R1WT851XXMC7L7", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "After researching digital cameras for months, I bought this camera 5 months ago, and I have enjoyed it ever since. The camera is so slim on compact, it easily fits in pockets, while packing all the major features needed in a good digital camera.As an amateur photographer who just wanted to capture memories, I love the settings button, that lets you choose all the settings based on what type of shot your taking (some options are running water, birthday event, night landscape.) The camera also has a host of features for more advanced users like histograms and ISO speeds.The battery life is amazing, and I don't even bother taking my charger with me on vacation because the battery lasts so long. I bought a 1 GB SD card to go with it, and it can store hundreds of high quality pictures. The camera even lets you look at your pictures in a calendar mode, so you pick a date and it will show you all the pictures you took on that date. The video recorder is a great feature too and of pretty good quality.The only downside is the screen on the back gets scratched very easily. I just bought a $2 screen protector for an iPod and it fit perfectly.", "Date": "October 23, 2006"}, {"Title": "Broken in 2 weeks; Casio wouldn't honor warranty", "Author": "Rob in Cincy", "ReviewID": "R30GGZHS9RS6H8", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I purchased this camera last summer.  After about 2 weeks, the lens door started to make a clicking sound and stopped opening. I returned it to Casio for warranty repair.  Called 8 weeks later, and learned that they had sent me a letter, which I never received. After two requests, they FAXed me a copy.  It said that the camera had \"corrosion,\" which was not covered by the warranty.  Repairs would be $135 (cost was $200).I had the camera returned unrepaired, and carefully opened it.  There was no sign of corrosion anywhere inside (examined it with a 10X lighted magnifier). I then exchanged E-mails with Casio Customer Service (an admittedly nice lady).  She said that all I could do was to send it back for another exam by the same techs as before!  I guess \"the customer is always right\" doesn't apply to Casio.  Would not recommend this camera, or any other Casio product, based on this experience.", "Date": "December 17, 2006"}, {"Title": "The best word to describe is \"Wow.\"", "Author": "D. Mellott", "ReviewID": "R2WOBXJB2YSXPX", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I got this camera to replace a 3.2 MP Nikon Coolpix... and it instantly gave me a wow effect. The camera is so thin, it fits comfortably in your pocket to go anywhere. And the screen is beyond huge (my Nikon only had a 1.3 inch screen, so this is a major upgrade). The only disappointment would be the actual \"resolution\" of the image. I mean... the picture files themselves don't seem to be able to be zoomed in on the computer as much as I was expecting without becoming pixilated. But I guess maybe that's how it's supposed to be, 6 MP doesn't mean you can zoom and crop for eternity? Either case, I soon got over that... because the pictures always turn out great. Colors are accurate, pictures are VERY clear, even in a variety of situations, and the Best Shot modes are actually useful, unlike on my Nikon in which they didn't help very much. Also I must say that this camera is very fast at taking pictures, starting up, and recovering from the flash going off. Which is great. It's so annoying when you have to stand and wait with the \"black screen\" while the flash reloads or something. Finally, I will say that the included rechargeable battery is AWESOME! It lasts for... almost eternity. You can take hundreds of pictures on one charge... so great! Previously, I would always need to have spare AA batteries along, but not anymore! This camera will fulfill the needs of any normal person who isn't expecting an SLR-camera. I would recommend it to anyone. Before purchasing this camera, I put a lot of research into it's competitors. I say: Buy this one.

Frank", "ReviewID": "RS2OKIGETNR97", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "When I first started looking for a new camera, I was set on a sub-compact model.  I really wanted a camera that I could slip into my pocket and whip out for an impromptu picture.  (The pocket thing was important because I tend to shove everything in my pockets instead of a purse.)  I'm also the kind of person who likes to get new things, but doesn't like spending money.  The Z60 fit the bill...it's tiny, sleek, and a good deal.  I love that it takes only a couple seconds to turn on and get set to take a picture.  The large LCD screen is great, too.  My only complaint is that sometimes the pictures taken from a distance in poor lighting come out a little blurry.  However, I had read about that happening with this as well as other sub-compact cameras, and it is to be expected given the small size of the camera.  There is an anti-shake feature that attempts to counteract that.  That being said, I have been very happy the vast majority of the pictures I have taken (several hundred since I got it).  No regrets--5 stars!P.S.  A memory card is a must.  The camera's internal memory only holds about 16 pictures.  I purchased a 1 GB card, and it can hold 475 pictures at 6 MP, which is plenty for me.", "Date": "July 31, 2006"}, {"Title": "Great camera with a bulky charger and non-standard USB", "Author": "Gadget \"Pamela\"", "ReviewID": "R2NAI5SYLR7EA4", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "I do love this camera, but why does it come with a clumsly non-compact charger? My previous camera was a Cannon and the charger hasd a neat, compact charger with a flip out wall plug, perfect for a compact camera. If I am buying a camera because it is compact, I certainly don't want to lug around a charger with a bulky 8 foot cord attached. Also, this camera does not have a standard mini-USB/USB cord for downloading the pictures to a computer. It has a 'special' plug end for the camera. I like the common cord becasue its easy to and convient to share pictures--almost everyone has a standard cord laying around.This camera takes great pictures and has many nice features, but it has some obvious flaws. Attention to details is what makes a camera a great product. I would not hhave purchased this camera if I had looked in the box before I ordered it.I hope Casio reads this review-they have a great product but my next camera will not be a Casio unless it comes with a compact charger and standard cable.", "Date": "August 31, 2006"}, {"Title": "Great Camera!", "Author": "Jason Mathews", "ReviewID": "R245D21V4FAMNG", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This is the best digital camera I've ever owned.

Its got a nice, clear big screen. The point and shoot feature is cool. It's got alot of different modes to choose from. Personally, I like the fact that in \"review\" mode, you can view your pictures by a calendar and see what picture was taken on what day. Thats great for organization and for recalling certain events. The only negative comment i would say is the video quality. It just gets slightly blurry when you're zoomed in a little.

I was notified it would arrive from the 21st- 26th but it appeared on my doorstep on the 19th.  Bravo Amazon free shipping!  When I first opened the package I was amazed at how small the Casio Exilim EX-Z60 was.  I was also amazed at how much it weighed! It must've been less than a pound!  But that was before I realized the battery had to be inserted.  However, the camera was still very lightweight.  It came with the USB cable instead of the cradle, which i actually prefer because I move around a lot & I enjoy just having to bring the wire, not the whole cradle.Pros: very small & lightweight, excellent style & picture quality  is wonderful for the size of this camera.Cons: buttons are a bit small, but that is to be expected of a camera of this size.Overall, the Casio Exilim EX-Z60 is a great choice if you're looking for a small compact camera.

Murray", "ReviewID": "R1F0L8MGJA0PYS", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "Samsung NV10 10.1MP Digital Camera with 3x Optical Zoom with Advance Shake ReductionI bought both the Casio and the Samsung right before Christmas last year.  At the time, they hadn't come out with the 10mp Casio, so these 2 were the best comparison products for ultra slim camera models.  After much comparison, I like the Samsung camera better, and here's why.  The Samsung's battery has a better lifespan and it's also easier to charge.  The Casio battery has to be placed into a charger outside of the camera body and it slips easily, so even when you think it's charging, it's not.  The Samsung's battery can be charged while it's in the camera, which is easier and foolproof.  The Casio's buttons are very small, and even though I'm a girl with delicate fingers, I felt like I had to work awfully hard to get the buttons to work, including the power button and the shutter release.  There are a few things I liked better about the Casio, I like that the flash options are on a button and not inside a menu, it's much faster to switch the flash options.  I also like the roundness of it's design a little better.  As far as image quality, the Casio had some distinctive color fringing in highlight areas, and  distinctive noise in low light situations.  The Samsung has noise too, but it's a little less obvious.  The Samsung's auto focus was faster than the Casio's, also the Casio has a long time delay between focusing and being able to shoot the picture, and in that delay it freezes the shot, so you can't continue to watch the motion, and that was very hard to get used to.  I'd be framing a shot, and while it was focusing, I'd not only lose the moment, but I would end up shooting the ground instead of my cat, because I wasn't able to see what was going on while it was focusing. On the other hand, the Casio's flash seemed to recycle faster.  Also, the Casio's flash is in a better location.  The Samsung flash is located at the top of the camera, so when I would go to take the picture, I almost inevitably had my finger over the flash when it would pop up.  Not a big deal, it hasn't broken or ruined a shot, it's just annoying.  I can't remember all of the features of the Casio, but I don't remember it having manual options for shutter speed, iISO or aperture, but I know the Samsung does.  I also don't recall it being able to take Video, but I could be wrong about that also.  The Samsung's video function is a little rough, but it's good to have for those random moments that you wouldn't want to miss.  I'm a professional photographer who was looking for a fun camera to keep in my purse, and after trying these 2 out, I kept the Samsung for myself and gave the Casio to my sister.", "Date": "June 3, 2007"}, {"Title": "One of the very best small cameras ever", "Author": "Jonathan V.

My photos from both cameras were awesome, and I was very surprised to note that the photos taken with the Casio were somewhat better than my more expensive Sony.  I'm sure some has to do with the technology (being that my Sony is much older) but I think a lot has to do with the Casio just being a great little camera.  The BEST SHOT feature is awesome and takes the guesswork out of changing environments.  I used the SCENERY choice the most, but also used FLOWER (for closeups of flowers and other things) and the PORTRAIT choice for pics of my friends and family.  I also took some pictures on the regular AUTO setting, which also came out great.  I loved how fast this camera is - I was on a boat ride and dolphins began jumping through the boat's wake and in one fluid motion I grabbed the Casio, hit the ON button as I swung my arm over the side of the boat and instantly clicked the shutter button - I got an incredible shot of the dolphin jumping through the air!

After reading some reviews (after ordering the camera - duh!) I was concerned because they weren't across-the-board positive.  But I've now had the camera for almost 2 months and have taken hundreds of pictures, including many 5-stars.  I'm happy to report that the quality is far superior to the images my husband has taken with his more expensive Canon Power Shot A630, which can't seem to focus worth a crap.  This little camera has far less of a shutter delay than either Canon we've owned, and I no longer miss the shots of my toddler that we couldn't get to save our lives with our Canons. Another great feature is the \"soft flash.\"  I use this indoors a LOT or for fill flash outside when a normal amount of flash is just too much.  My only complaint so far is that I actually have to hook the entire camera up to my computer when I want to download images.  For some reason the memory card isn't \"readable\" when I put it into the card slot that's built-in to our home computer.

She didn't want anything too complicated or too big or too expense. I researched everywhere and I compared several models side by side online (Cannon's, Casio's, Panasonic's, Sony's). Each seemed like good cameras but after seeing these models at different stores I focused on the Casio Exilim models. I did a little more research and read lots of reviews and I selected this EX-Z60 model mainly because of it's small size and price. After using this camera for over a month taking pictures of our one year old, we both love it.The picture quality is very impressive. I was a little concern at first because the image did not look as clear through the large LCD screen before taking the photo but after looking over the photos, all I can say is WOW!!! Great image!! Vibrant colors!! Great lighting! This camera is simple to use. It has a lot of features but you don't have to change anything from AUTO if you don't want to and you'll get great images everytime.  The second thing that really impressed me about this camera was the video. I couldn't believe how clear it is. Althought I will mention that the lighting has to be good. I don't think I'll be pulling out our video camcorder anytime soon unless it's for extended filming. It's quick, easy and delivers great images.I love how quick it is to start up. It really helps capture the moments in video or pictures.To summarize the features I love best: Small size (fits in pocket), quick start up to start taking pictures, quick after taking a picture to take another one, great image for pictures and video (although video needs good lighting), Simple to use, good battery life, large 2.5 LCD screen, and the low price.

For about 50-75 feet in front of you at night outside, the objects in that radius will show up clearly in the picture taken. Outside of the radius, objects will begin to appear grey, and faded.The videos shot with the camera aren't the most clear, but they are decent quality for the price.

Broten", "ReviewID": "RXFQBM55EBL21", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I got this camera because my other one, a Nikon E5600 died. This camera is great.It looks really cool. I have the red one, but all the colors look good. It's very slim and very light. This is definitely a camera to show off to your friends because of how good it looks.Also, the screen is really big. That's a huge plus.It's really, really easy to use. It's perfectly fine to take it out of the box, put the battery in, and press the shutter button. Everything about it is very intuitive. And the scene modes are great. I've gotten some great shots playing around with those.The battery life is also very good. I've been able to use it days on end. It will certainly last through a day of almost constant use, and during normal use it will last much longer. Better than the rechargeable NiMH AAs I'm used to working with on my Nikon.The color with this camera is really good--that's the absolute best part of the pictures. The color just pops, especially if you have the right shot.However, the optics are not as good. First of all, zooming in or out will give you a pincushion/fisheye effect, which isn't a big deal unless you're shooting something with lines (buildings or grids of any kind), where it is painfully noticeable unless you're zoomed right in the middle.The sensitivity causes noise. Dark pictures will be full of noise. This isn't as big of a deal if you're using flash. But high sensitivity is generally not the best with this camera.Also, the sensor just isn't that sharp. Taking 6MP pictures and just looking at them in Photoshop at 100% zoom you can see it. Even in full daylight, the darks are grainy and the mids are not sharp at all.Others say that they can get great pictures out of this camera, but I can not see it. Perhaps there are settings I can adjust to make it better, but for a point-and-shoot, that seems to defeat the purpose. And even so, I have some knowledge of photography and I do try to make my pictures as good as possible.The other bad thing is that because the camera is very easy to use, it has little to offer for manual settings. It has the standard white balance/ISO/Exposure correction adjustments, but that's about it.So the bottom line is, that this is an awesome camera to carry around with you, to take pictures of the family, to go to the party with, or most general use. For 4x6 prints, computer backgrounds, and all of the things that most people use their camera for, it is just fine.If you want to use it for anything more professional, stay away. It just will not cut it.", "Date": "October 15, 2008"}, {"Title": "Wonderful Little Camera", "Author": "Robert E.

The small size of the camera and the large screen is a huge bonus.  It's also very light which makes it easy to bring anywhere; unfortunately it's best for casual snapshots.  Unless you are outdoors and it's well lit, you are going to struggle getting photographs.  I have since upgraded to a Nikon D40 (dSLR) for my real pictures and have the Casio as back-up \"just for fun\" camera.Pros:-Great battery life-Huge display screen (2.5 inches!)-Metal design feels sturdy in your hand-Small!  You don't even notice it in your pocket or purse.-Best shot settings are helpful when you don't know what settings to use.Cons:-No actual viewfinder.  Trust me, you need that.  If it's even remotely sunny, it's so hard to see the display; therefore making composition, immpossible.-A lot of noise in low light situations.-Flash is very harsh, even in the soft setting, giving a lot of pictures the washed-out drunk party picture effect.Don't get me wrong, I do still love this camera to bring along when I don't want to risk damaging my D40.

However, I did test the other best picture settings (choosing a camera setting for each picture type, aka, picture of food, picture by candle light, picture of scenery, etc) and those work great but I seriously hate to take the time to set the picture type before every picture I take.Second complaint is that even though the screen is very big, there is some major pixelation going on there in certain lighting.Thrid complain I have is that the highest setting and top quality pictures it takes, although they are high res, are only 72 DPI.
