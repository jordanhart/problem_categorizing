And this 640x480, POE, dome camera does a nice job.  It has a lot of barrel distortion but security cameras in general do not take prize photos. POE makes installation much easier. And for a POE injector I'd recommend the \"TP-Link AC TL-PoE150S PoE Injector\".  I found the POE switches only have enough power to support 2 POE cameras. Setup works nicely. You can view the images through browser.  However once the camera is configured, I don't use the Toshiba software.  I use Blue Iris from Perspective Software for managing my entire heterogeneous set of security cameras which include Panasonics, and Tenvis night vision cameras.  Remember if you like this camera, do not use it where the surveillance area is say more than 25 feet away.  You want a higher resolution camera for that.  Also this camera does not have any remotely controllable pan and tilt  functions - you must set the camera's  direction manually.", "Date": "February 7, 2013"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": "$296.70", "Features": "TOSHIBA TOSHIBA MINI-DOME NETWORK CAMERA. 2-4MM WIDE ANGLE LENS. 1/4 INCH CMOS, PROGRESS", "Name": "Toshiba IK-WD01A IP/Network Mini-dome Camera, PoE, 640x480, 2-4mm Lens", "ImgURL": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41Ui8dbxkVL._SX300_.jpg", "ProductID": "B001BIFD98"}}
