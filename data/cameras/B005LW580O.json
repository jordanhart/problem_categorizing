In terms of picture quality when compared with higher end models all the way to the 60D, it is difficult to determine any differences between them.The biggest sacrifices are ergonomics and features like frames per second and flip screens, but I have to tell you that it is a great starting point for any enthusiast wanting to discover DSLR photography. ISO 6400 is really helpful when compared with models like the XS which Canon stop showing in their website; the XS was Canon's entry level before the T3 but it only had ISO 1600 (useless). ISO 6400 with Photoshop Lightroom 3 makes unwanted grain a thing of the past.The camera is small and convenient; I recommend buying the body only and getting and upgraded lens instead of using the 18-55 kit les that comes with it. Good quality pictures come from high quality lenses, so save the money from the kit lens, and buy an upgraded lens like the Canon 24-70L for people with money or the Tamron 17-50 2.8 for people on a budget that want a good balance between price and quality.The bottom line is the lens is more important than the camera if comparing all Canon models under $1000.00.

The negative or neutral reviews are mainly from whinny wanna be \"experts\", Canon haters, and some real pros who have more demands and are sometimes difficult to please. I mean seriously who scrutinizes the very edge of a photograph for flaws in 10% or less of the shots? All I want to know is, did I capture the moment I was looking for in that middle area in better detail and clarity than my trusty canon point and shot? Yes? Then good, done, i'm happy.The only thing I suggest is don't treat this like a small point and shoot, its more delicate, keep it safe, get a bag for it, don't drop it in the diaper bag, etc etc. In short just bring it out for special occasions and keep it in a safe place when you are done shooting. Use the neck strap!! Buy a cheap point and shoot for the crazy moments. For example use the cheap P&S; for the party and break out the dslr for the cake cutting and the pre-party dressup shots before the cloths go to hell, you parents know what i'm talking about!

This camera has fit the bill perfectly.  I have had it for about a month and can't think of anything else I could have wanted in an \"entry level\" camera. My 35mm SLRs (Canon and Pentax) could not record photo settings and I was lazy about recording this information so I could never tell what I did to produce a particular image. Not so with this camera.  The settings are effortlessly recorded for every photo.  Can't remember what you did?  The camera does it for you. As a result, the Canon Rebel T3 will make you a better photographer.Image quality is excellent.  Anyone who complains otherwise is expecting $1500 performance from a $500 camera.  That is unreasonable.  I have found the Canon Rebel T3's resolution to be impressive. Some photos that I thought were good showed details that, in my hyper-critical opinion, ruined the shots.  These were certainly not problems with the camera. They were all problems with the photographer.I couldn't be happier with this camera.  The software that came with it was an unexpected bonus.  The Canon Rebel T3 is billed as an entry level DSLR camera but that doesn't mean it isn't a serious camera.  I recommend the Canon Rebel T3 to anyone considering serious digital photography.  People moving up from a \"point and shoot\" digital camera will be able to use the camera on \"full auto\" mode in no time and those interested in learing more advanced digital photography will find plenty to interest them.  No one purchasing an entry level DSLR will be disappointed by the Canon Rebel T3.  I bought the \"body only\" because I already had a bunch of Canon lenses  but there is nothing wrong with the \"kit\" lens if you buy the Rebel T3 \"kit.\"", "Date": "December 16, 2011"}, {"Title": "A great beginner dSLR", "Author": "CGScammell", "ReviewID": "R1QJHFQYIGIV8N", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "If you already own a Canon dSLR, get the body only.  Canon  kit lenses on the budget dSLRs are simply not that good.  Why pay extra for mediocre glass?I am a passionate hobbyist and a Canon user since 2006.  I bought this T3 body only to replace an ailing Canon xS with auto-focusing problems. Both are selling at the same price, but the T3 offers a few upgrades:  12MP vs 10 MP, faster burst mode, video mode and more focusing points on the sensor.  I already have a plethora of good Canon and Tamron lenses and didn't want a cheap kit lens the Rebels are notorious for, so I bought the camera body only.I take this dSLR into town, on long hikes, camping trips and backpacking adventures, so the lighter weight of a lower-end Rebel made from polycarbonates is ideal for me.  My cameras take a beating. I leave my 7D home for more indoor portraiture shots.The Canon T3 looks smart. It feels more solid than the xS and the handgrip has a slight rubberized coating for better grip that the xS does not have.  The buttons are almost all in the same place except for the SD slot; on the T3 it is with the battery slot on the bottom which may be an issue with battery packs.  The bodies look very similiar, so there was no great time wasted reading the manual.  For those new to the Rebel line-up, however, I greatly encourage to read the manual to better understand this camera, as it has many great features for an affordable price.  Most people who are dissatisfied with a camera or lens usually just don't take the time to learn the many capabilities of that piece of equipment.  There are differences between a Nikon and a Canon dSLR as there are different terms and physical layouts for everything.  It's like studying French and German simultaneously.I shoot mostly in A-DEP and Manual mode, although P and Auto are also used when doing snapshots.  When using the first two modes, however, the photographer must be aware of proper settings in white balance and ISO modes as otherwise photos will appear washed-out or over/underexposed.  This is the fun and creative part about photography that I enjoy.The T3 ia better suited for sports photography than the xS as it has a rapid-action burst mode that lets you take ten shots in a row.  This is faster than the xS.As all lower-end dSLRs, this camera is made in Taiwan.I am happy with the photo quality of my photographs.  Colors are vibrant.  I now carry it in my camera bag as a side-kick to my Canon 7D.I will update this review as times goes on.", "Date": "September 15, 2011"}, {"Title": "Film to Digital", "Author": "D.

This is my first DSLR, and while I am no prosumer I know when I'm happy with something. The picture quality between this camera and point and shoot type cameras is obvious from the onset. The larger sensor results in a level of detail that is just not possible with point and shoot cameras. I've used it in conjunction with my 24- 85mm f3.5/4.5 USM lens, and I'm very happy with the results, especially portrait type shots. The in-camera help guide lets me change settings with confidence, to the point where I now shoot exclusively in Av, Tv or manual. A camera like this should never be used in full auto. I know there are many critics out there who are caught up with minute technical details, and these are probably individuals who do photography for a living or have a lot more money to spend. At this price, this camera gives you a wide range of control over most variables with ease. I can control depth of field, speed, white balance, exposure, iso rating, etc. I also have the option to shoot in RAW and then edit afterwards, which is a huge advantage over point and shoots.I've become accustomed to the layout to the point where I no longer need to look when I have to rotate the wheel or engage other controls, as the camera is very ergonomically designed. The camera almost encourages experimentation, and I deliberately shoot the same subject using different settings just to see how creative I can be. The only reason I gave it 4 instead of 5 stars is due to the fact that I have not used other brands or higher end models to which I can compare my T3.The canon manual is almost useless though, get David Busch's guide to the T3, it's an excellent manual to go along with an excellent camera.", "Date": "May 9, 2012"}, {"Title": "Shady seller", "Author": "Robin G.

First off, it arrived 3 days after I ordered it and that was with standard shipping-- extremely fast. So thank you for that! As for the camera itself, it is wonderful. I upgraded from a Canon Rebel XT, so this is a beauty compared to that. There were many things about this camera that were not mentioned in the product description, so to name a few perks: it has a smooth shutter sound, it tells you on the screen what every mode is used for as you flip through them, the ISO goes all the way up to 6400, it has video option, it has a live viewing option, it is very light, and altogether is very user friendly! I rate this camera a 5 because it works beautifully and I got it for $200 less than it currently sells for in store.The only problem I found with this purchase was that the included accessories were not clearly stated anywhere. The camera also comes with a strap, battery, battery charger, computer cord, manual and CD's (no product box). I was pleased with these accessories of course, but since it did not state that it came with a battery charger, I bought one separately, so now I have two.

Why?  Would I really need to be concerned about the megapixels at the highest level.  I am currently shooting with a Canon 300D, which goes way back in time, but still takes good pictures.  I has a whole 6 megapixels.  The Canon T3 gives me TWICE that of what I have currently.  The T2i would have given me THREE TIMES the megapixels.  I decided that it was not necessary for my standard picture shooting, and was over-kill for my needs.  As for the 1080p video, versus the 720p on the T3, that also is fine, as I really do not intend on using the camera for shooting video.  I have a camcorder, which shoots in HD, @1080p, that fits in my pocket--very portable.  As for the screen, on the T2i, which some professionals were all hyped up about, I don't care that the resolution is higher on the screen.  I review pictures on my computer, not on the camera.  I have also found that I want to see a full sized picture, on my monitor, not a shrunken midget, on a tiny screen.  I will occassionally do a quick review of a picture, just to make sure that I got what I wanted in the frame, but that is it.  The end result being that the screen on the T3 is just fine for me.  Now for the rest of the features, I compared the T3, T3i, and T2i, on the Canon site, and there is otherwise only a fraction of a difference between them.  The difference was not enough for me to fell that I would be missing something, by buying the T3.  For the extra money that the T2i costs, I bought a 50mm, f/2.5 lens for my new camera (well, I had to chip in a few more bucks!  I also had to battle other would-be buyers on Ebay to get it!).  I stuck with the Canon line, as having had my 300D for years, it has served me well (and yes, I plan on keeping it, as a back-up).  The lens will work on the T3, as they would have also worked on the T2i, or the T3i.  Basically the T3 gave me the majority of the features incorporated into the T2i, and T3i, that I actually needed.  I was not interested in spending the extra money for the 'fluff'.", "Date": "April 6, 2012"}, {"Title": "Great entry level DSLR value for learning your way around manual photography.", "Author": "akmac", "ReviewID": "R28M2X1N9NIBKF", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I have found these features to be most useful:Partial metering, spot selected focus, exposure compensation, bracketing, ettl 2 flash control, full manual control of shutter speed, ISO and aperture, the ability to shoot in raw format.  It still has fully automatic settings for those that just want to point and shoot.There is also a  live view function which works great for setting manual focus while using a tripod.  You can zoom all the way in and move anywhere in the frame to focus exactly where you want to.The body is very light, made from what feels like a very durable smooth plastic.  However this plastic is very slick- use the strap so you don't drop it!The LCD is very large, with good image quality.I found the menu system fairly intuitive to use.Now what it is lacking:There is no mirror lock up. This is not a problem if you have a good tripod, but is worth mentioning if this is a deal breaker for you.It also does not have spot metering, but instead uses partial metering.  I have very little experience with spot, but have had no problems getting the exposure I want with partial.This camera does not shoot video in 1080, it is limited to 720.  I personally could do without video all together, I bought it to take pictures.There is no built in remote sensor.  You will need a cable release or to buy a third party wireless solution.The cache is somewhat limited.  This is only an issue if you want to shoot continuous action in raw format.  It will bog down after 4 pictures.  If you shoot in jpeg you can shoot continuous all day long without delay so long as you have the proper sd card.Lastly there is no auto sensor clean, just a manual function that flips the mirror up so you can blow the dust away, or clean it physically.These really have not been issues for me and for $279.00, I am not complaining, just pointing it out to help you make an informed decision.If you are looking for a new hobby, want to learn your way around a dslr, or expand your subject capabilities without breaking the bank, this is the camera for you.  With a little bit of learning , experience and the proper lenses you can still get professional looking results with this body.

For casual use, vacations, family photos, general all around shooting, I don't see that as a problem, plus it's a lot lighter to carry.

This camera takes SHARP photos with an old Tamron 100-300, and beautiful macros with an even older full-manual Tamron lens that I used to use with a full manual Fujica.  (I jammed the f-stop pin in!)  AND all that with no image stabilization!Not everything is clouds and teddy bears, though.  I also have a \"multi-element\" Tamron zoom from the Elan days, 28-200.  Looks like fungus infestation -- lots of \"fog\".  Can still get good pictures by focusing manually, but wish I could get this thing to work so I don't have to change lenses.  What's worse, put a CP on it and NOTHING comes out, whether auto or manual focus.  That's not the camera's fault though, so no problems there...Just a couple minor complaints about the camera:1)  Toggling between f-stop and shutter speed (or exposure and f-stop/shutter balance in program mode) is difficult because you have to find a pushbutton with your thumb while spinning the wheel.  C'mon!  I'm taking pictures, here!  (EOS Elan had a wheel on the back, so you could adjust both options simultaneously...)2)  When in program mode, the camera always seems to want to open the aperture.  See item no. 1 above!3)  Seems like the sensor and mirror are dust magnets.  One of my first outings was a water-fight.  I had to crop a \"blob\" out of the sky on a great many of the photos.  Scared me and I thought I had a bad sensor until I read up on it and figured out how to photograph the sensor to see the dust.  I got one of those Giotto rocket blowers and took care of it, but now I see it's also a problem with the mirror.  (Photos are still awesome, though...)I bought this camera because it was comparatively \"cheap\", but I discovered it's not built cheaply.

And the 6400 ISO enables much superior low-light sensitivity compared to other cameras in this price range.", "Date": "June 1, 2012"}, {"Title": "Canon Rebel T3 Camera Body", "Author": "Amazon Customer", "ReviewID": "R2W3TSBMW733F9", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I replaced my original Rebel body with the Rebel T3 and am very pleased with the extra features.  It arrived in a timely manner.  Was new as stated and in the original box which included everything but the 18-55mm lens which I already have.  Have been having a great time getting to know the features of the camera.", "Date": "August 23, 2012"}, {"Title": "As a pro photographer, this is very nice, and so is the price", "Author": "Audio Junky", "ReviewID": "R2TJ3PDPOEPS1O", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Yes, you can get a camera with more pixels,(you don't need over 10, this has 12) and more than 4 shot bursts(never needed more in 5 years on the job), and blah blah blah. However, if you buy this camera and some really nice glass to go with it, you can out do any other camera out there. I have never needed to crop an image more than this camera allows before breaking down. This is the second t3 we have bought, and we use them for weddings, photo shoots, and all our sessions. If we use these as our tools for work, that speaks volumes for what this camera and the right lens can do. Just like the car a racer drives, it matters what we use. We rely on this camera's abilities combined with our own to provide top notch quality images to our clients, who are repeats in many cases. A 50 pancake lens looks so good in studio it's amazing. Everything from an 18-55 to a 300 looks amazing. There are also the video options, which look fantastic with a telephoto lens in HD. There is no flip out breakable display, the batteries are affordable, the flash is bright, but you will NOT use it, due to the low light abilities of this bad boy, and all ef and ef-s lenses work as well. I have put this very low level canon on my tripod and set it to take a time lapse of the stars in the dead of night, and that really cool swirl appears. Keep in mind, this is not a 1000.00 camera, but it acts like one. Like when a little dog snaps at a german shepard, this camera thinks and acts like a big dog. If you have any doubts, count your cash after you buy it, then try to take a picture of something your favorite pro has taken and compare. With the correct lens you will be amazed. The colors, light, speed, weight, accessories, cost, and ease of use make this a must have. Throw that cell phone in the car with the little tiny digital camera and use a pro grade camera for a starter camera price.

None of the grip areas are textured as is found in the canon line above the T3, and it lacks an articulating screen.  It does not have the latest external flash control menus as found in t3i and higher.That said, this was given as gift and the recipient was extremely happy with it.  The sensor itself is quite good, and it has a native sync speed of 1/200 or 1/250 depending on the trigger used.  While it lacks full external flash control menus,  it has full E-TTL II and HSS capability.  I would say that it has usable raw files up to iso 1600 or so with 3200 at a stretch.  This inexpensive camera is really a great pair with the canon 50mm f/1.8, which gives a field of view similar to an 85mm lens on the full frame cameras; great for portraits and a fast,  general mid length prime walk around lens.", "Date": "January 28, 2014"}, {"Title": "Horribly soft focus", "Author": "Artworks Images Photography", "ReviewID": "RVDS1KV3UOUKE", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "'m a professional photographer so I'm a little more picky about my photos then the average person but I don't think I'm unreasonable when it comes to wanting a sharp image. Most people wouldn't ever notice their images slightly blurred but I know some do. I replaced my XTi with the T3 after it got stolen after 8 years of wonderful use. This was for my personal use, not professional so I wasn't looking for anything that delivered like a Canon 5d would. Let me say that the price is great for this camera. You can't beat that but after using this camera, it is definitely not worth any more then the $300 I paid for it.The cons:The body has a very cheap feeling to it that I have never felt in a canon camera before (I used to work at a camera store a few years back). It feels almost like one of those disposable cameras you used to be able to get. Like not $300 cheap, more like $80 cheap!I have had VERY few sharp images with this camera. I'm a professional photographer so I know what I'm doing it taking a sharp image. I used my 17-55mm and my 24-70mm lenses and neither could produce decent results. These lenses are worth $1000 and $2000 so if anything could get a great image from this camera, they should. And I'm trying not to be overly picky here but they were very soft images.Pros:Light weightpricecan shoot at much higher ISOs then my XTi. Its amazing the difference in this little camera. I can shoot at 3200 without any noticeable noise in a properly exposed photo. This is far superior to my old XTi. I had no idea the lower end cameras were advanced enough to do that. But I would assume that any camera above this (60D, T3i) would be able to deliver this as well.The camera seems to communicate better with my external flash. I've been getting much better exposure while using my external flash in low light situations. Once again, I'm sure any model above this would do likewise.As a sum up, if you don't notice the soft focus and don't mind the cheap feeling, go for it. If you're concerned with those factors, check out the T3i. Its only $200 more and has a swivel screen. I'll be checking it out myself to see if the focus is better.", "Date": "August 2, 2013"}, {"Title": "reliable", "Author": "M.

My Nikons (D70, D40, D200, D3100) were very good, loved their ergonomics, auto-iso, P mode, auto white balance, and spot-on fill flash, but the pictures did not have the stunning rendition of the XSi. I purchased this T3 hoping it would have the same colors and picture quality as the XSi, but no luck. Unlike the XSi, fill flash in aperture priority mode is a little harsh, auto white balance is off indoor (the D3100 is perfect, both indoor and outdoor), auto ISO is stupid (AUTO ISO defaults to 800 when flash is turned on, why?), exposure is mostly off indoor (have to set it to +0.7 or +1). The D3100 was almost always spot on. Colors are off. This camera is not even close to the XSi.On the plus side, it has a movie mode, which can be useful for the occasional funny family moments, and the buttons are all placed on the right side of the screen, very easy to reach with one hand. the LCD display is very good.
