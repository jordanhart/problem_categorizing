I really worked hard to try to set up this camera, but all of my efforts failed.  I finally had to reach out to customer support.  They do NOT do phone support at all.  They only provide email support, and may be able to remote into your computer to assist you.  I was just not patient enough to continue waiting for an email back from them, so I am sending the cameras back unfortunately.If you are patient (unlike me), they may be able to help you get your camera working.  They are nice people, and were very apologetic.********UPDATE********I decided to allow them an opportunity to remote into my PC.  It took them about an hour to get it set up due to the type of router I have.  After allowing them the opportunity to set it up for me, the camera works VERY well.  Th night vision is really great! I am now a happy camper.  I'd like to say that I have Lorex cameras as well, and those are VERY expensive and are not wireless.  The wireless ones are even more expensive.  Comparing these to the Lorex, these provide an excellent view, and the pan and tilt are and added bonus.  I recommend this product very much.  Just be prepared to be patient in setting them up.", "Date": "April 16, 2014"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": null, "Features": null, "Name": null, "ImgURL": null, "ProductID": "B0057LW4MO"}}
