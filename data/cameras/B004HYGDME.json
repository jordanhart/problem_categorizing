{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Photos are not sharp and colorful", "Author": "RondaM", "ReviewID": "R1SC5JR5EVETTR", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "I bought this camera two months ago.  The camera has 14 megapixels, but the images are not sharp.  Most of the pictures come out looking soft and the colors are not bright or even accurate in some cases.  I have tried all kinds of combinations on the settings, but none give me the result I was hoping for.  The Best Shot selections do not give me clear and crisp photos.  I cannot return this camera now as there was only a 30 day window for returns.  Although the price was good, I do not recommend this camera.", "Date": "August 25, 2011"}, {"Title": "Broke in days", "Author": "busylady", "ReviewID": "R3RQ9NVGZ71XC7", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "We did a lot of research looking at different point and shot cameras and decided on this one based on price and function.  Unfortunately it was a bad choice!  It worked great for a day or so and then when you turned it off the lens wouldn't retract all the way and it made a clicking noise as it tried.  If you gently pushed on it, it would go in but needed help.  We were very disappointed in the camera.  It seemed to take great pictures but we only had it a few days before it started to malfunction!  Wish we would have picked a different camera!", "Date": "August 1, 2011"}, {"Title": "Bad power cord design will cost you", "Author": "DougC", "ReviewID": "R3FHXJE110Q19B", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "Good camera, great features, takes good pictures.  BUT, the power cord can easily be inserted upside down.  And if you do, it breaks the little pins inside. To Casio's credit, they warn about this in their manual, but no one reads manuals anymore.  My daughter plugged it upside down accidentally and then the camera would no longer charge.  The little tiny pins inside broke.This is simply poor design.  I guess they didn't do any usable testing before releasing this product. With this design flaw I can only give it 1 star, sorry Casio.", "Date": "February 27, 2012"}, {"Title": "A Great Series of Cameras!", "Author": "P.

The Exilim series is a fine, little camera, not too expensive, very light and it produces great photos.

Also, night pictures come out pretty dark and the pictures aren't very clear if you don't use the flash.  But color of the camera is a little darker than the picture with the description above, but it is still a nice blue color.  For less than $100 the quality is good, but not as good as I would have hoped.", "Date": "November 25, 2011"}, {"Title": "Amazing :)", "Author": "Rebecca Burtulato \"Beckie\"", "ReviewID": "R1F9C4NDJOVWIQ", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I saw this in the BestBuy store a few days ago and its only $99.99 and on the Bestbuy website it's $119.99 so if you buy this I suggest you go to the store and save $20. or how ever much amazon is selling it for, now of course before I bought it I played around with it to make sure it was to my liking. The zoom is very good but if at first it blurs that's OK after a few seconds it focus's so you don't end up with a blurry shot. The colors it comes in are very pretty so of course I bought mines in blue. The features on it are good as well you can adjust the color,resolution and brightness. Now for the battery life its pretty good depending on how often you use it and how long you keep it on like any other camera but I'd say its pretty decent. I've gone a week without charging it before. Now when your zooming and you take a picture chances are its going to be a little bit blurred then if you were to take one with no zoom. Other then that I have no complaints, and trust me I take pictures of EVERYTHING but I guess that's normal for a 16 year old right?haha :)I hope my review helped!", "Date": "November 16, 2011"}, {"Title": "Good buy!", "Author": "Chris W \"Chris W\"", "ReviewID": "R3N65Q8QWQDG6H", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I can't much about the functionality as I bought it for my niece's high school graduation.
