{"Reviews": [{"Title": "OK Product - Bad Support", "Author": "Josh", "ReviewID": "RQMK023D486GB", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "I purchased this item a couple months back and was quite please with how easy it was to get set up with my CCTV cameras.  It worked great for a month, with the exception of the network features.  The basics of recording video and performing playback were flawless.  Unfortunately, I had problems with the included written documentation because it gave me the wrong default passcode for the admin and user1 account.  So I thought I had locked myself out and wasn't sure how to get the device restored to factory defaults.  It wasn't until I it up the electronic documentation on the included CD-Rom that I found that they had changed the default passcodes out of the box.The other problem was that there is a tricky little key combo that you have to push and hold to get the USB mouse and front display keys to operate after a hard reboot.  This was disclosed on a little piece of paper included with the packaging material.  Well, to my detriment, I have lost that little piece of paper with the key combination and it isn't listed anywhere in the electronic documentation either.  So I'm sitting here with a device that is recording, but I can't access either remotely or locally.I've scoured the web looking for technical support, but there is little to no support from the manufacturer.  I went to their website and performed Google search after Google search looking for information about support, but have been unsuccessful.  I would say that I am an expert in the field of network and systems administration (my career field), but this one lacks the intuitive nature, logic, and online support that any user would look for in the event of system issues.You might think twice about this product if you're doing anything more than basic features or you accidentally lose important documents :(", "Date": "August 5, 2011"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": "$2,399.95", "Features": "16 CH Video Input H.264 triplex real time economical stand alone DVR\nGraphical interface, easy to use.
