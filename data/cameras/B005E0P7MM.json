{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Love this camera+accessories (Make sure you note the difference between the T3i and T3)", "Author": "Melissa", "ReviewID": "R1TWEX7NNXUAPO", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This package is fantastic and the company has great customer service! I say this because originally I ordered a different package from this same company thinking I was ordering this one--the T3i. What arrived was the T3 and I realized I had made a mistake and ordered the wrong product. (See my review under the T3 to see the differences in the products). The woman with customer service was great--and helped me exchange it and order the right package--this one! It arrived ahead of schedule and all of the accessories in this package are quality given the price.  It has EVERYTHING you need to get started...so you'll be able to shoot right away.  In addition, I've been pleased with the quality of the pictures and video that this camera shoots. I'll probably upgrade the case later...but it will do for now. I'm terrible at big ticket purchases...I mull over them at length and question whether I made the right decision so it was really comforting when everything finally was straightened out, arrived and was fantastic. I'm really pleased with my purchase.", "Date": "August 2, 2013"}, {"Title": "Very Satisfied as an Entry Level photographer", "Author": "Adam M. Burleigh \"Adam M. Burleigh Photography\"", "ReviewID": "R3ENXTMH2Z8SNE", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I am a new photographer so that makes me an entry level photographer too.. The camera itself is very nice. If you have medium to smaller hands, it is VERY comfortable and light to hold. All a bit confusing at first, but the instruction manual tells you what you need. The standard kit lens is pretty good, I took some shots today and yesterday and got some pretty clear shots and nice colors. The zoom lens does NOT have anti-shake or image stabilization so a tripod is definitely needed. The tripod is very unstable when fully extended, but is pretty good for the price when extended to the first level. The wide angle and macro telephoto lens' are lens attachments. The wide angle lens has vignetting a bit, but isn't too bad. I didn't like it very much. The macro telephoto lens attachment is pretty sweet though. Got a few clear shots using it.. : The wireless shutter control is downright awesome.. Very helpful with the tripod that comes in this package. Carrying case is standard, but holds everything plus more. The memory card is top notch! No problems yet.. The UV filters are pretty cool, not a lot of difference though. Cleaning kit is pretty standard, but works like any other cleaning kit. Card reader is nice and also comes with a USB extender cord. Does have a second battery in this kit, however, if you prefer all Canon products you should know that the extra battery is NOT made by Canon. Screen protectors are pretty basic, haven't tried them out yet though. Memory card holder is pretty sweet for on the go.. This kit DOES have a wall charger, but only one and it doesn't have built in plug. It uses an external wire to plug in the outlet.Overall I'm very satisfied with this package deal. Definitely the best I've found so far and everything preforms pretty well for the price paid. Definitely recommend this to the newbie entry level photographer. No disappointments yet! :)*The only thing I'd like to see added to this package would be a lens hood, but those are really cheap here on Amazon.. :)UPDATE: Two years later, I've learned a ton with this camera. New photographers need to be warned. The kit lens is the cause for red outlines. Once you get a nicer lens it disappears... ;)", "Date": "October 7, 2011"}, {"Title": "Great camera kit", "Author": "Masterofenergy \"Jenna\"", "ReviewID": "R1EYW2M3FJR5MV", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "For the price this was a great deal.

Both lenses are fantastic and offer a lot of flexibility.  The enclosed accessories make it a good complement to try out your new hobby without breaking the bank.  Friends that have purchased the expensive lenses and accessories at the photo shop do not get a better result.2 things I would suggest changing - the extra battery and the SD card.  Get the higher performance card and the original battery.  I would not mind adding the extra payment for these two.", "Date": "January 8, 2014"}, {"Title": "Great", "Author": "Kim Malys", "ReviewID": "R31Q63S673VED3", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "It such a great camera and such a great deal with everything that you got in the package.
