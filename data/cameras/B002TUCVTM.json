What I wanted was an unobtrusive camera with wide capture angle to replace a bulky and ugly camera that came with a package set.  Installation was a snap and  the microphone is nice b/c it does a nice job capturing conversations near the front door.  Video quality is great and it's lasted 9 months so far without any problems.  I'll plan to buy more of these as the need arises.", "Date": "May 2, 2010"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": "$579.95", "Features": "High-resolution camera produces images of 700 horizontal lines\nBuilt-in 1/3'' SONY Effio CCD, Color DSP, Automatic CDS sensor\n28 IR illuminators for night vision, f3.6mm wide angle lens\nWeatherproof Vandal proof housing and sunshield for indoor and outdoor\nPackage included: 1 sony effio CCD camera, 1 Pre-Amp mini hidden microphone, 1 pack video audio power cable, 1 power supply and 1 free security warning sticker", "Name": "VideoSecu Built-in 1/3'' SONY Effio CCD Day Night Vision Outdoor IR CCTV Security Camera 700TVL 28 Infrared LEDs Wide Angle High Resolution Vandal Proof Weatherproof with Pre-Amp Mini Hidden Microphone, Extension Cable and Power Supply 1ZG", "ImgURL": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51XONO2%2BtRL._SY300_.jpg", "ProductID": "B002TUCVTM"}}
