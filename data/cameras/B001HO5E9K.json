I moved from a PowerShot S5 IS to the 50D shortly before my grandson was born.  I wanted to start taking photography more seriously.  This is an extremely nice and reasonable package because it includes everything one needs to start taking pictures immediately, i.e. a nice sized memory card, extra battery, tripod and case.  The kit lens has a nice zoom range, but I wasn't satisfied with it and soon replaced it with a Tamron 18-270mm, and then, a Sigma 50mm f/1.4 (my personal favorite).  The 50D is feature rich and tremendously flexible providing seemingly endless opportunities to learn how to better create digital images and perfect ones skills.  It is good for action, capable of shooting 6.3 frames per second, it is fast focusing and good in low light, capable of ISO 12800, and in Live View, i.e. using the back LCD as the \"view finder,\" it's possible to test out the various White Balance settings or color temperatures, or zoom in and more sharply focus on a detail before the picture is taken.  There's really much more that can be said in favor of the 50D than can be written here.  A reference I found practical was:  \"Canon EOS 50D Digital Field Guide,\" by Charlotte K. Lowrie.  Of course, the 50D does produce great, clear pictures, but given the flexibility it provides success does demand some amount of knowledge and skill...and that challenge is what continually interests me about photography.", "Date": "February 11, 2010"}, {"Title": "Amazing", "Author": "Sylvia", "ReviewID": "R3N4UPKNU4ILJ1", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Love this camera.
