{"Reviews": [{"Title": "An amazing deal on a great camera", "Author": "Joseph Thomas", "ReviewID": "R19GN1WK5UTCQW", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This is really a very good camera, as you will see if you look at some of the other listings for the camera. Also, at the time of writing this, the camera and lens that comes in this package is $49 more than the package, and you get the accessories with it. It is all in retail packaging, and seems to me to have been put together in the box when I ordered it. It all seems very well made, though not everything is as it seems in the picture. For example, the picture has a Patriot SD card, and the one that I received was a Transcend SD card. Also, the card wallet, SD card reader, and camera bag are not the same as in the picture. However, they do work very well, and so I do not mind that they are not the same brand. I am very impressed with how complete this package is. There is only one thing that I can think of now that I would have liked to see in it, and that would be an air blower for cleaning the sensor. It does have what you would need for a \"wet clean,\" but that is usually considered a last resort, right before taking it to a repair shop. However, at this time an air blower is only five to ten dollars, and so I am not upset that it does not include it. There, the basic review. If you would like, you can continue for an individual review of each item.1- Canon EOS Rebel T3 Digital Camera and 18-55mm II Lens Kit With all supplied accessories -- Really a great camera. Very easy to use, and it takes amazing pictures without being too expensive. -- Price alone: $429.001- 32GB SDHC Class 10 Memory Card -- Plenty of memory. On the large JPEG, high quality mode on the camera, you can take approximately 6,666 pictures. -- Price alone: $21.991- Rapid External Ac/Dc Charger Kit -- It is great to have the extra charger, and better that you can plug it in in your car. I keep the one that came in the box for the camera plugged in in the house, and this one in my bag. -- Price alone: $9.991- USB Memory Card Reader -- This is great, because sometimes computers, especially desktops, do not have a card slot built in. -- Price alone: $5.991- Rechargeable Lithium Ion Replacement Battery -- This is another great feature. If you are going on an important photo shoot you don't want the battery to die. And, with the DC charger, you can use one and recharge the other. -- Price alone: $9.991- Weather Resistant Carrying Case w/Strap -- You really have to have a bag. This one works just fine, and most of what came in the package fits in. -- Price alone: $5.121- Pack of LCD Screen Protectors -- I was happy that these came with it. I would never have thought to look, but it will keep me from having to have the screen replaced if it should be scratched. All I have to do is replace the screen protector, and it will be as good as new. -- Price alone: Sold in kit.1- Camera & Lens Cleaning Kit System -- This consists of a microfibre cleaning cloth, a bottle of cleaning fluid, and cotton swabs. I have used the cleaning cloth many times, and the cleaning solution with a cotton swab for when I accidentally touched the mirror, and left a finger print. I hope to not have to use it on the sensor for a long time, but it can also be used for that. -- Price alone: Sold in kit.1- Mini Flexible Table Top Tripod -- I was a little disappointed with this. It is kind of hard to see how small it is from the pictures, and it had some trouble supporting the weight of the camera. -- Price alone: Sold in kit.1- Memory Card Wallet -- This is great for helping you keep track of more than one memory card. It keeps them all together, and is bigger than the cards themselves, and so is easier to find in your bag. -- Price alone: Sold in kit.Kit price: $7.751- 3 Piece Professional Filter Kit -- These seem to be good quality, though I do not use them much. However, they did come with a nice case. -- Price alone: $8.501- Professional Full Size Tripod -- A tripod is really a must, especially if you are doing self-portraits, or long exposures. EDIT: I have since had to replace the tripod because I made a nut fall out, and couldn't get it back in. I got a more expensive tripod (though not by much) because I wanted something a little sturdier, but still think that this is a good tripod to start out with, before you know if you will use it enough to get a more expensive one. It also comes with a nice carrying bag. END EDIT -- Price alone: $17.151- Wide Angle Lens Adapter -- This is great for making things seem farther away, or getting more into the shot. It does have a bit of trouble with lens flare, but that is avoidable if you are careful, and I actually like it in some of the pictures. If you go to 18mm, you will be able to see the lens in the corners of the shot, but if you zoom to about 24mm, you can no longer see it. It also has a macro lens with it. -- Price alone: $13.451- Super 2X Telephoto Lens -- This is great for taking pictures of things that are farther away and still feeling like you are really close. If you are fully zoomed out with it though, you will be able to see the edges of the lens. But you don't need a telephoto lens on the wide angle side of your zoom lens anyway, so that shouldn't be a problem. -- Price alone: $11.99Value of package: $540.92Price at time of writing: $479.99Savings: $60.93I don't know about the rest of you, but I think that is a pretty good deal!EDIT: When I wrote this review originally, it was during a Black Friday sale. So, if you are looking at it at any other time of the year, the savings will be more than what I recorded in the original review.
