{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Great camera for the price", "Author": "Walter A. Spelyng \"Zzzz\"", "ReviewID": "R10QHS2WNQ5RIF", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This is a great point and shoot camera. I've taken some great shots in the auto mode. The Tele. lense helps on getting close up's on long shots. And maybe the best part it is easy to use and understand. In auto, you simply point, shoot and get a gerat shot.  I have not tried the manual settings, maybe because so far I've taken great shots in auto.  All in all, it was exactly what I was looking for, and the price was right. Also the included accessories were a bonus. The delivery was fast. An excellent supplier. I would purchase from them again.", "Date": "September 25, 2013"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": "$419.95", "Features": "KIT INCLUDES 12 PRODUCTS -- All BRAND NEW Items with all Manufacturer-supplied Accessories + Full USA Warranties:\n<1> Nikon Coolpix P520 GPS Digital Camera (Red) + <2> Transcend 64GB SDXC 10 Card + <3> Spare EN-EL5 Battery +\n<4> Battery Charger for EN-EL5 + <5> Zeikos 50\" Compact Tripod + <6> PD-C15 Camera / Camcorder Case +\n<7> HDMI to Mini-HDMI Cable + <8> PD SDHC Memory Card Reader + <9> PD 5pc Complete Cleaning Kit +\n<10> LCD Screen Protectors + <11> PD Memory Card Storage Wallet + <12> Image Recovery Software", "Name": "Nikon Coolpix P520 GPS Digital Camera (Red) with 64GB Card + Battery & Charger + Case + Tripod + HDMI Cable + Accessory Kit", "ImgURL": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51kkCxVZW7L._SY300_.jpg", "ProductID": "B00DEMS0M6"}}
