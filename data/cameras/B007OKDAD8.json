One had a european plug converter (which is exactly what i need since i travel). Also the charger could be used in your car. Then there was a SECOND travel charger. Also cleaning kit, multiple screen protectors, and basically everything else they said. Box had lens cap, strap, tv cable, usb cable, 4 batteries and cd with softwareThe camera is amazing. Manual controls which i have been looking for for a loooong time. The screen tilt is greatLots of options too.
