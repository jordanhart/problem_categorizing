{"Reviews": [{"Title": "WOW!!!!", "Author": "Erica A. Cohn", "ReviewID": "R17X7QCUOF2FB2", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I was very reluctant at first to order this as I had never heard of the seller and read some sketchy reviews.  Item shipped almost immediately and I received the tracking info.  Granted I had to wait for UPS to sign for the package, but I understand the reasons.  Was somewhat leery as the camera was priced more than $200 less than it was at BestBuy or other like retailers, AND came with ALOT of stuff.  Was very worried that it would be an out of box refurbished item.  Package came as expected as per tracking info.  All items are brand new in their original packing.  And again, it came with A LOT of stuff!!! Got too tired to unwrap everything and put it away.  If you want to buy this camera, BUY IT HERE!  Plus with Amex points which I could use through Amazon, ended up paying only $100, when I almost paid $650 at a retailer just for the camera.  Looks like it finally pays to be a shopaholic.", "Date": "September 27, 2013"}, {"Title": "great buy.", "Author": "Horace Wallace", "ReviewID": "R2H9HT8LDZAU78", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Its loaded with features easy to use takes excellent photos and is priced better than most other brands.

The items in this bundle are junk and the filters and lens in the bundle do not fit this camera. I strongly recommend purchasing the camera separately.

It is not as bulky as an DSLR, but has many of the features and still takes great pictures.

Good reviews of the camera itself can be found under the non-bundle listing.So is the bundle worth it? If you can get it for only $50 more than the camera and lens then it is. At $100 more it is a close call. I have been pleased with some of the items in the bundle and a little disappointed with others. The two lenses are all right, but only really work with the camera zoomed out to 50mm (otherwise you get edge blur). The tripod is very nice and the extra battery is definitely worth it. The camera bag can hold a lot of stuff, but it is generic and so it needs to be packed carefully so that items don't bang against each other. The screen protectors are a joke and the universal media stick has such bad reviews that I didn't even dare try it. Other than that everything in the bundle works as it should.If you think you might need any of the items in the bundle (which most photographers would) then this is probably the way to go rather than just buying the camera itself.", "Date": "March 14, 2014"}, {"Title": "Dead camera replaced by seller", "Author": "JBinLV", "ReviewID": "R2RR58IISN3PSB", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "No problems with the ordering or delivery of the camera. This camera is a birthday present for my adult daughter. She wanted a nice camera to take photography classes. The Camera worked for a few days, but now will not turn on. The status light blinks until the battery goes dead. Battery charges and the status light blinks again. It's the weekend, so I sent email support that got returned because it was not the correct email address for United States support. I called and spoke to Samsung support, the tech believes the USB charging cable is the problem and he is sending one out 7-10 days, he claims the cable end should light up and it doesn't.. I think the tech is wrong so I'm going to the local camera store for a plug in battery charger. Seemed like a really good camera, that might just have to be returned. I must say that I'm less than happy with Samsung support, and this will affect my decision to buy any other Samsung products. UPDATE..... The seller Sunset Electronics, exchanged the camera body for me.  The new camera body works great, takes beautiful photos. I'll rate Sunset Electronics as 5 + stars! the camera now gets 4 stars, and Samsung customer support gets 1/2 of a star.", "Date": "March 22, 2014"}, {"Title": "Amazing deal !!!!", "Author": "Bhishma", "ReviewID": "R3Q6IPU8SMPR7O", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I say this is the great deal in less price.
