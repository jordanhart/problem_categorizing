{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Functional Surveillance IP Camera", "Author": "MarkUS", "ReviewID": "R17ZE83MXPWDLS", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I have this M1113 and the M1054 surveillance camera. You will definitely have to read a little on the device setup. The pic/vid quality of this camera is not as good as the M1054. The M1054 has better res. The PoE works great. The reason why we got this, is the ability to enclose for outdoor use. I'm using Android App \"IP Cam Viewer\", for remote viewing. Also, I'm using QNAP NAS to record the camera 24/7, on a rotation. Motion detection, to send alerts via email. You will need an outgoing SMTP server, to have this feature.The security camera cannot take strong password, so try using weak passwords. The PTZ works ok. Get the M1054 if you don't need to mount, for outside use, and don't need PTZ. Ignore the negative reviews on the M1054. My M1054 has never had any network or disconnect issues.", "Date": "January 4, 2012"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": "$449.00", "Features": "Surveillance Camera\nAXIS Communications", "Name": "AXIS COMMUNICATIONS AXIS M1113 SVGA H.264 2.9-8.2MMPERP VARIFOCAL 720POR 1MP PROG SCAN", "ImgURL": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/312ioyVISWL._SX300_.jpg", "ProductID": "B003HOXND2"}}
