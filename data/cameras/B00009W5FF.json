The Canon G5 fits the bill.It does everything I ask it to do and does it well. I agree that the noise produced above ISO rating 100 is unacceptable,but the ISO setting of 50 for the G5 is equal to 100 on other cameras and the 100 setting is equal to 200. I find that with the availability of f.2 to f.3 speedy aperture I find little need to shoot at any higher ISO. As far as the complaints I've read regarding soft images and poor focus,I have not found this to be the case.After taking around 800 shots with the G5 I can say that the images are very sharp with no focus problems.Perhaps the complaints stem from the users technique. Yes,the shutter lag is a pain,but shutter lag is a problem with all compact digital cameras.If you don't need enlargements beyond 8X10 then go with the less expensive G3,but if you want enlargements up to 16X20 and don't want to invest in a digital SLR I think you'll be more than happy with the G5. Shoot at ISO 50 when possible. Keep in mind that a vast number of the best published 35mm images are shot on Fujifilm Velvia (ISO rating 50).", "Date": "October 2, 2003"}, {"Title": "Problem with relative ratings", "Author": "Tony Evans", "ReviewID": "RR02QHI7YQUW5", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I recently bought the G5 and I am extremely happy with it. When deciding which camera to buy, I was initially put off by the numerous negative comments (especially on here). But when I compared the G5 with its competition (Nikon, Sony, Olympus etc) it was clearly a hands-down winner in terms of overall features and image quality. So why the bad reviews? Because this is a series, G1, G2, G3 and some reviewers here are comparing this camera against its predecessors. So yes, G3 users may be disappointed with the G5, but only because they've been spoilt with the G3. Giving the Canon G5 1 or 2 stars is plain silly. This is a 5 star camera, and it knocks the socks off its competiton. When reviewers give ratings, they ought to rate the camera on its own merits, or compare it to its competitors, but to give it a low rating becase it doesn't live up to elevated expectations is wrong. It is also very unhelpful to potential buyers who may be put off by the low rating, buy another brand, and end up with a camera that is \"surprisingly good\" and \"surpassed expectations\", but which is sadly inferior. Disappointment noted, but the G5 is clearly the best in its class, and well deserving of 5 stars.", "Date": "August 19, 2003"}, {"Title": "Good all-rounder for serious amateurs", "Author": null, "ReviewID": "R2DUZFSZ9V6IMQ", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Buying a camera, like buying most things, is a trade-off - there is no single right answer. On one hand, it's \"horses for courses\" (get something suitable for the type of photography you plan to do). On the other, we each must weigh the features of different models against each other, prioritize our personal wants and preferences against the price, and decide what is best for us. It's subjective and personal.I had already had a Canon Powershot S20 for a few years when I decided to get a Canon G5. Why should I want to do that? Was I dissatisfied with the S20, with its limited manual operation features, 3MP resolution and 2\u00d7 optical zoom? No; I had originally planned to keep both, but I have found that the G5 is not so much bigger after all, so I am going to sell the S20. I just don't need both of them.While the G5 is still a small camera, there are many things it can do that the S20 cannot. Of course, there are still a few things the G5 cannot do, but for the general sort of photography I do, they are not many.Here are the main issues, chosen partly in the light of other users' (sometimes negative) reviews of this camera:1 Do I need 5MP resolution? Yes - mainly so I can crop a good chunk of the original image when I need to, which is quite often.2 Do I need the 4\u00d7 optical zoom? Yes. I don't have the wide-angle or tele lens converters yet, but I may get them later.3 Do I need the fully manual control and the many focussing and exposure options? Yes - quite frequently (more often now that I have them, of course).4 Do I like the ergonomics and aesthetics of the G5. No question. A few minor quibbles, but nothing serious.5 Good value for money? I think so. Actually I think that most competing products are also good value for money. We get more for our dollar in photography now than ever before.Comments on some specific complaints that have surfaced in other reviews:1 Chromatic aberration (manifests itself as purple fringing under certain light conditions): I conducted a very thorough review of reviews before I bought this camera, and I decided to risk it. I am glad I did. The problem exists, but under practical (not test) conditions it is rarely noticeable. You may see it in very contrasty parts of a picture (e.g. bright lights against a dark background) when you are using an aperture wider than about F/4. This problem seems to be somewhat worse in the G5 than in some other cameras partly because it has a faster lens, which I hardly see as a fault. In all other respects this lens is as good as any, and better than most.2 The noise issue: at higher gain settings (`film speeds'), all digital cameras show increased noise. The G5, according to some reviews, is rather worse in this than some other cameras. However, according to the same reviews, the G5 shows higher gain than most other cameras for any given setting. ISO 400 on the G5 actually seems to be about ISO 700 on other cameras. In the end, I could not really see any difference in normal use. I use ISO 50 most of the time anyway.3 The viewfinder: to avoid getting part of the lens barrel in the viewfinder at wide angles, the viewfinder would need to be located further from the lens, which would require a bigger body, or else you would have to have a smaller lens. It's just another trade-off. Some cameras avoid this problem by just not having a viewfinder at all. There are times, however, when a viewfinder is the best way to frame the picture, at least for me. I can live with this.4 The lens cap: lens caps are a necessary evil with any lens that does not retract more or less fully into the camera. The G5 has a simple (but nicely molded, not at all cheap-looking) plastic lens cap that comes off quite easily. This is surely intentional, because if you turn the camera on before removing the lens cap, it gets pushed off by the extending lens without damaging the zoom mechanism.Overall rating? I'm giving it 5 stars, partly to offset some of the absurdly low ratings given by other reviewers. Otherwise I'd have given it about four-and-a-half.", "Date": "October 20, 2003"}, {"Title": "The Sweet Spot for Digital Point and Shoots", "Author": "Dom Miliano", "ReviewID": "R1D77UK6Z8KAG6", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I love my 2 Megapixel Canon Elph. Small, sharp and reliable - during its time, it was all I could ask for.  I even sold a couple of its pictures to magazines, so what's not to love?  While I have not discarded my Elph, I recently moved up to the G5 because it's better in every way. With a fast 4X optical zoom (all the way out to a 35mm-camera-equivalent of 140MM) and 5 megapixel chip, it could easily become my new favorite camera. The manual is thick but it uses a lot of illustrations and the text is surprisingly clear and simple so the reader should not be intimidated. Not being one to read manuals, I was able to take the G5 out of the box and immediately shoot pictures without cracking the book (the battery came out of the box with a decent charge too - how cool is that?) That's how simple and intuitive the camera is. I have already made a few 8X10 prints on my Canon color printer and they are sharp, show excellent contrast and have good color balance too. Like most auto-focus digital cameras there is a brief shutter lag. It's not too bad but the shutter release is certainly not as quick as one of my 35mm Leicas. Speaking of Leica, the shape and size of the G5 is very close to that of the classic Leica M series cameras. And the clever design of the battery case allows it to serve as a grip - I found it comfortable and secure. (Note: a similar grip is a [$$$]option on a 35mm rangefinder Leica!) I don't like the fact that you can't screw a UV, skylight or other kind of filter on the front of the lens. I like to have a good quality filter on the front of my lenses for protection - but that's me. For the average camera user, there are 2 auto exposure settings that should cover the vast majority of shooting situations. (I used \"P\" and got an \"included in the box\" 32mb compact flash card full of great exposures.) For the advanced photographer, the G5 comes with just about every manual control you could need or want - similar to those on their excellent EOS 1V pro camera. One cool feature is the ability to capture a shot in both RAW and JPEG at the same time. This feature will give you a \"pure\" file with no data loss due to compression and will allow you to make the largest, sharpest print possible. (The manual says that the RAW file is compressed, but there is no data loss - must be a new form of Japanese magic!) Bottom line, the RAW format will give you the biggest file with the most information. I suspect that a RAW file will allow the careful user (i.e., one who is fussy about focus, exposure and camera shake) to make an 11X14 inch print that is as good as any 35mm camera (maybe better!)  When compared against the many excellent digital cameras out there, the Canon is a stand out. Its size, resolution, simplicity, and Canon's excellent reputation for reliability made it and easy choice for me.", "Date": "January 14, 2004"}, {"Title": "Canon G5 is GREAT", "Author": "G.

WOW, what a difference.The depth of field has improved a LOT.  Now, you can photograph the same road, and see a 1/2 mile down the road in clear focus rather than a blurry end.  You can pick out license plate #s two blocks away from where you took the photo.  Ever taken a photo of a purple flower and had it come out blue and awful?  I took photos of some purple flowers and they came out crisp and gorgeous deep color purple.  Like to photograph insects?  WOW, you get to see them CLOSE UP.  The macro function is astounding.  You can see the detail of fly eyes and misquito wing structure.  The detail on my cats teeth is totally awesome using the macro function.  I can see every bit of smile and every little scale on his tongue.  Like photographing nighttime views over a moonlit water?  MAN, it is so awesome using the night scene mode.  You can get moonlight over the ocean and buildings lit up over the bay in clear focus with no pixelation.  They must have fixed that.About the fringing and the noise - if you take photos with a film camera, you know how tough it is to get a good photo at dusk or in shadow.  The digital camera is doing what you tell it to, if it isn't coming out right, try a different time of day or use the flash!  If you are photographing a building against the sun, DUH, it's going to have fringing around the edges.  The sky will look white if you photograph an object with the sun behind it.  Try using the white balance controls - this camera has so much you can test and try out.  Read the manual.  Try every function on the camera before you give up.  Having trouble focusing?  The dumb Conversion Lens Adapter LA-DC58B made especially for the Canon G5 is to blame, in my opinion, because when I take it off, WOW, OMG, the photos are perfect.  I think the adapter blocks the focusing beam.

Here's my take on it.- The lens is amazing. Fast and crystal clear. In digital cameras, the lens quality is more important than the mega-pixels beyond a certain point - for me personally that's 3.2MP- The battery lasts forever compared to other cameras in this range.- Tons of features, with amazing customization and configurability. I've taken beautiful photos in extremely low light conditions to very still pictures in high motion environments.- Very capable.- The package comes with everything you need. All the cables, remote control, charger, ac adapter etc... The only thing you have to buy is a big memory card.- The software drivers are nice, but the rest of the software is pretty useless. Download picasa ([...]) - it's better than iPhoto and is now free.- It is big and bulky (smaller than an SLR, but bigger than the S50). I bought this instead of the small S500 - at the time they cost the same; and have no regrets. The capabilities are worth the extra bulk.Read all the reviews of the purple fringing and chromatic aberrations.

(2) to fix the first issue, you can buy the lens adapter and screw on a 58mm filter but this adapter is so large that it interferes with internal flash coverage, creating a black cast in the bottom right of pictures and also, it makes the optical viewfinder unusable. (3) even w/o the adapter, when using the optical viewfinder, the lens blocks a small corner of the view on widest angle. Why use the viewfinder? If you're following action, LCD displays may not have quick enough response from picture to picture.

The G5 is a great digital camera for all kinds of users, however is simply too much camera for most people that will want to take snapshots; many people won't even touch on using or even understanding all of the features the G5 has unless they have some photography experience.The lens is quite good, it's very sharp no matter the aperature used, the autofocus is of average speed, and the zoom is roughly equivalent to a 35-140mm on a film SLR - you get a pretty good range of focal lengths as long as you don't need wide angle or extreme telephoto shots.  Bokeh is okay at wide aperatures, but don't expect it to compare with a good SLR lens, because it won't.  Macro shots are very good, with little distortion, sharp focus, and decent bokeh.Image quality of the pictures is excellent - colors are balanced and realistic, and edges aren't oversharpened at all, 8x10s look fantastic but I have yet to print anything larger (The G5 should be able to make a nice 11x14 print).Featurewise, the G5 is very well rounded - it has a full auto mode, which works quite well, except the auto exposure for shots using the flash tends to overexpose the picture (This does not bug me since I usually use manual or priority modes), it had a program mode which gives you some control over the camera settings, and various manual modes including full manual, aperature priority, shutter priority, and also several scene modes for taking portraits, night landscapes, and more.My biggest complaint with the G5 is that it takes very noisy pictures at a given ISO - ISO 400 is utterly useless for taking shots because they are so grainy, ISO 200 is usable but I wouldn't print an 8x10 with it, and ISO 50 and 100 are okay - this camera is great for outdoor shots but if you need something to work with inside without a flash, you are better off with a D-SLR of some sort.Ergonomically, the G5 is great, it's well built, easy to hold, and all of the controls are easy to reach and intuitive.  There are numerous functions however, and it will take most people a while to become accustomed to and comfortable with all of the camera's features.  The flip out LCD is a very useful feature, and it has helped me take many shots that I couldn't have made otherwise.Overall, it is a very good all around digicam, but for some people with specific needs (Long zoom, wide angle, indoor shots without flash), there are better choices.  I strongly reccomend this for people with photography experience, but it is complete and total overkill for someone that wants to take snapshots.", "Date": "January 24, 2004"}, {"Title": "Aesthetic upgrade, except for faster response times", "Author": "Shashank Tripathi", "ReviewID": "R3MJQGZ4STPGZ7", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "It is simple. Nikon makes the best SLRs. Canon makes the best digital cameras. This is particularly true in the prosumer range, where Canon's Powershot Gx series beats them all with its ease of use (both hardware and software), in looks and holding comfort (which is a subjective opinion, and this is mine), in the sheer realism of the pictures etc etc. I own both the G2 and the G3, the latter being a upgrade more for the purposes of competitive response than anything else -- different bodyline, somewhat higher pixel ratio etc. Now, G5 may come across as the same with little to show for, except its black paintjob and the insiginficantly higher pixel ratio. A tad disappointing for us Canon aficianados who were expecting a bit more from the next in the series. WHAT'S NEW: (1) Black body. Personally, I have gotten used to the silver finish, which appeals to me. I hope Canon doesn't standardize on black and makes the next cam available in both colors. (2) More \"megapixels\" (of course). Which doesn't really mean squat unless you wish to print your photographs on 20 x 30 photopaper.  (3) Video recording with sound for 3 minutes (actually G3 can manage about the same).  (4) This could be an important factor to some of you who believe digicams haven't yet reached their prime given how pathetic their focus speeds are -- G5 rocks in terms of instant clicking. G2 was painfully slow and effectively useless for sports photography for instance, G3 was a remarkable improvement, and G5 now is almost as good as EOS in its response time. Summary: what can I say. Great camera from Canon, but falls short of being spectacular as an upgrade. If you already own G2 or G3, wait for the next in the series by when let's hope the clicking response times should match EOS and other digital SLRs.

The lens is outstanding, and shots taken at ISO 50 are wonderfully free of noise even in low light. What killed the camera for me is the autofocus. For some reason it often has a hard time finding focus. In several situations from macro to landscape and at various light levels the autofocus would hunt for seconds and then occasionally would give up and lose focus entirely. The conditions mentioned in the manual that might cause difficulty with focus were not present. Of course, I could focus manually but that can be a tedious task using the LCD display (and not just with this camera), especially in bright light. The camera has a good feel and is easy to use but I finally gave it up from the frustration with focus.

I bought G5 and I am happy about it. I red prefessional reviews and comparisons and let me tell you something. Regardless what they say about purple fireing and increased noise, canon G5 gets the sharpest and cleanest picture of 5 megapixel sensor out there. I even compared it with fuifilm s7000 (6.4 megapixel camera), G5 brings more details and better colors. The shapes of the objects are original and edges don't diffuse like all other cameras of this price range (+ - $200) except canon digital rebel 300D. All other cameras have problems either with their not enough bright lenses or not as good CCD sensor. They all try to compete with canon and this is how cheap they do it...>They run noise reduction algorithms before the picture is being saved in memory and their pictures loose lots of details, objects loose edges and their pictures look more like a painting. This is why canon has the sharpest picture. If you take orginal G5 photo in photoshop and do noise reduction, the resulting picture will have a micro low noise, far less than any sony, nicon, olympus, or anything else out there, while still keeping the sharpest picture compared to all cameras above. The profesional reviewers fall for this as I can see from what I am reading, and they rate canon g5 as having the sharpest picture but worst noise, sending wrong message to readers about the canon true quality. In fact canon g5 original picture has far the least noise from its 1.8 inch CCD, however canon technicians don't run noise reduction algorithms and leave this option up for users. Or just do this - set up low sharpness mode and you will get the most noise free pics compared to the competition while still being the sharpest.If you ask me I prefer high sharpness, which increases the noise slightly, but improves the contrast and sharpness of the picture. When you print out picture like this you will get the best looking prints since noise levels come in question only if you zoom in the picture in your computer, but for the droplets of the printer good color and sharpness is what counts the most for best prints.If you are looking for better quality and original noise free pictures buy digital rebel 300D. I didn't buy this camera only because my dad would kill me thinking that I spent a lot of money for a camera. Another reason was that this one is smaller and fits very tight in a little bag, making it perfect for \"bring me anywhere\" while having the image of a turist and photo satisfaction of a pro.Made one mistake though....>>>>>>Didn't look at canon S50 - the best value on the market.

Reviews by dedicated digital photo sites conclude that the G5 introduces significant noise into images causing the effect of extra resolution to be cancelled out by the degradation in image quality. Canon had to produce this camera because of our obsession with pixel count and in spite of the fact that all of the reviews of the G3 conclude that its combination of a clean sensor and excellent optics give it an edge over most 5 MP camers.Furthermore, very few people actually need 4 megapixels, much less 5. I had a hard time accepting this myself, until I printed out a couple 8x10s from my G3. 5 megapixels will simply mean that your memory card gets filled sooner, and each image will take longer to write to the compact flash card. Unfortunately, people look at pixel count much the same way as they do processor speed in computers. This is why we see folks buying P4 machines with 15\" monitors and 128MB of RAM.The G3, with its less noisy sensor and lower price is the sensible choice.

Here are a couple thoughts I haven't seen expressed yet. First, this is a compact camera, and that means the lens is made to tuck well into the body. The protective shell only extends part way out to keep the profile slim, so the fragile lens is somewhat vulnerable when extended. This is also the case with other maker's compact cameras. One solution is to add the lens/filter adapter, but if you've got any sense of style you'll be put off by its contrasting gray color. This, by the way, is the only way to add a protective UV or other filters - the lens barrel itself is not threaded. For a camera at this price and with these capabilities, the user should have a threaded barrel and sturdier lens construction. Second gripe is the placement of the controls on the back of the camera. I have average sized hands, but my thumb constantly bumps either the white balance or set buttons. It's more of an annoyance than a problem though, because they keys rarely engage from the contact.Canon clearly recognized both these issues, because they've fixed both in the new Pro 1.But don't let these turn you off.

Other controls are nonintuitive: expect to spend a lot of time with the manual.Serious purple fringing is evident in the images, a dissapointment for a maker of Canon's reputation.I'm not a novice: my first \"serious\" camera was a Minolta SRT-101 (in the late '70's), and I've since owned a succession of Olympus, Nikon and Canon SLR's.  Currently I use a Canon Elan 7 for film photography, and it's a fantastic camera.  Prior the G5 I was using a Kodak DC 4800 3mp model for digital photography: it was much easier to use and the image quality was nearly as good as the G5's.If you're considering this camera, be sure and take it for an extended test drive to make sure the controls suit you.", "Date": "February 28, 2004"}, {"Title": "Canon keeps the lead", "Author": "Michael J.

G2 and G3 users (other than the gear-obsessed) probably won't be lining up to trade in their cameras, but new users, or those upgrading from 2Mpixel cameras will find the G5 to be an excellent choice. It's still not quite the ideal compact for my purposes. The zoom range, equivalent to a 35mm-140mm lens on a 35mm camera, just isn't wide enough for what I want to do. I'd rather sacrifice the 140mm end and get something with a perspective equal to a 24mm-100mm lens, which would give you a long enough focal length for decent portraits and provide a good wide angle for indoor shots and landscapes. That aside, this is still an excellent camera for someone coming over from film. Resolution is sufficent to produce really excellent 8x10s with a little Photoshop fine-tuning. The manual controls are all you'd ask for. The fast f/2 lens allows shooting at high resolution in dim light. And the ability to link to the various Canon TTL flashes proides for exceptional control over lighting.

Most of the other guys had these dinky point and shoot cameras than had no manual controls on them.

It comes with with an Automatic mode (read as mode for dummies who don't want to deal with aperture, speeds, modes etc.) or you can choose different modes (landscape, portait, nightshot, stitch assist etc...). The controls for these modes is on the top of the camera and is designed well. I tried all of them and it does make a difference compared to the default mode. The stitch assist was also easy to do with the software that comes with the camera. I doubt it that I will use this feature again, but it's nice to know that it exists if the need arises.I was able to get the camera up and running quickly and transferring photos to the computer is a snap (just follow directions - equally well written manual) and you will be fine. What is not designed so well is the series of buttons at the back - specifically the White Balance (WB) and Menu. My hand tends to hit the back of the camera when you are taking shots. Also on extended zoom the lens is unprotected, making me a little antsy.Overall, I feel that this is too much camera for me. I still give it the 4 stars because it takes great pictures (get a 128MB memory stick as the 256MB memory stick has caused problems in the past - the 32MB that comes with it will not be adequate), it is easy to transfer and create an online photo album and the prints (4X6 as well as 5X7) that I developed are decent.", "Date": "March 6, 2004"}, {"Title": "After a year, no regrets.", "Author": "Richard", "ReviewID": "R3O6HBWVDN5ZPO", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "The lens seen through the view finder I knew about before purchase so I cant complain about that.The Selector icons (auto, portrait etc.,)wore off after only a couple of months!!

I would not recommend this camera to  others.  1) The optical viewfinder is partially blocked by the lens.  I find this very annoying.

If you shoot a back lighted object (say in front of a mirro with flash on) you will see a blue halo along the edge of the object.  3) Camera body not ergonomically designed.  It is hard to hold the camera with one hand, since the camera body does not fit the right hand ergonomically.  You will have to use both hands. 4) One has to remove the lens cap before turning on the camera.  This is also very annoying.  I wish I could keep the lens cap on with the camera turned on.  It protects the camera lens between shots.  5) Camera lens can be easily smeared without the cap.

Hall", "ReviewID": "RMBE71JF09BRN", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "This camera does a little of everything, video with sound as well as images. The pictures it takes can be fantastic. Unfortunately the subject has to be pretty still or in very good lighting to get a good shot. I took this camera to a soccer practice of a bunch of 10-year-olds in the daytime with heavy cloud cover and not a single photograph turned out. That included the few I used the built-in flash on (it couldn't focus). I also tried shooting some pictures at an indoor game that were disastrous because of the quick subjects (10-year-olds again) and low lighting.Even during several outdoor games in bright sunlight it just couldn't hack it. I took several hundred photographs to get 30 or 40 worth keeping. Most of the time I was struggling with the camera trying to get it to focus and snap before the children ran away and out of focus.I also took this camera to Hawaii for a vacation. It did much better when the subject stood still and smiled, but none of the evening sunset-shots turned out.The camera also has a flaw in that the lens blocks out part of the viewfinder. This isn't much of an issue once you get used to using the LED to line up your shots.On the plus side, this camera has a very long battery life and can use the Ultra II compact flash cards. The software was also very easy to use (be sure to read the instructions BEFORE loading it onto your computer, not during).Overall, my recommendation is to spend a little extra for an SLR camera and leave this one alone.", "Date": "February 17, 2005"}, {"Title": "Buyers Beware!
