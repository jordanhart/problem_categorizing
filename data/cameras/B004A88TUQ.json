A great deal for the money. 12 MP, HD Video capability, very nice battery life (which by the way is a rechargeable battery that comes with a very comfortable charging dock), the panoramic feature is very good and user friendly. Face and smile detection are also included. The Auto-mode is pretty intuitive and accurate.I am very happy with this purchase.", "Date": "December 29, 2010"}, {"Title": "Just Right", "Author": "Tighe White", "ReviewID": "R1ZQOOTJV7MK0I", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I needed a camera that has wide angle, point and shoot, fit in the pocket, fast start up, fast to write to card, inexpensive and decent quality photos.

However...I can't even pretend to like this camera.  It's slow to focus, when it focuses at all.  The images aren't sharp no matter what you do, and the features like blink detection and face recognition barely work, and when they do they're unpredictable and serve no real purpose due to that fact.The Auto Scene mode relies far too heavily on the \"Night\" scene, causing a drop in resolution and a huge bump in noise, and it also takes the camera forever to decide which mode to use.  Auto mode is too soft and uses too high of an ISO setting, causing major noise.  The only way to get a reliable decent picture is to go into the P mode and lock the ISO at 400 and the resolution at 11MP-2:3 mode.  There is no manual mode.  Even at max megapixels and Fine settings, JPG artifacts abound in finished pictures.The camera does have a metal body, but everything else feels super flimsy and cheesy, from the rattly zoom control and clumsy shutter release that is too trigger happy on half-presses, to the lens cover blades that stick open, and on to the control wheels that rattle around like they're barely attached.I do like the auto panorama mode, as well as the price, but that's not enough for me to recommend this camera.  If you are considering this camera as a cheapie, be warned you likely will not be satisfied with the quality of the pictures considering the learning curve and complexity of the menus.  Move up to a proper Finepix F-series like I did.See the difference in image quality here: [...]", "Date": "March 1, 2011"}, {"Title": "An Amazon treasure, Fuji FinPix famous for its quality and ease of use.", "Author": "Arkengareth \"Sage\"", "ReviewID": "R2O7GHABNO8BXG", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This camera consistently takes fabulous pictures, whether of still subjects or those moving, because there is a sport selection, not to mention the setting to take video pictures, and this camera fits into your pocket!", "Date": "July 14, 2011"}, {"Title": "Feels too flimsy...and I just don't like it!!.", "Author": "Woody", "ReviewID": "R2E7S42CUXDB7X", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "I've always had Fuji cameras and loved them, so when my last one finally died an honorable death, I didn't even consider looking at something else.  I wanted something small and easy with a couple of bells and whistles, for a decent price...so I chose this camera.  Bad move....  Everything about this camera seems so flimsy and cheap.  It's so light that it's even difficult to get clear shots.  My biggest mistake was purchasing a camera with a Lithium battery.  The thing just doesn't hold a charge.  If you don't have another lithium with you, you're basically done taking pictures.  I prefer to have a camera with AA batteries that can be recharged and if I'm out somewhere and they die, all I have to do is duck into a store for more batteries without having to dish out $15 for a new lithium battery to get me through.  I've tried all the settings, etc. but I am just not happy with the picture quality at all.  Sorry I bought it.", "Date": "July 23, 2011"}, {"Title": "EASY to use camera", "Author": "S.

I get fabulous pictures from this camera.  You can take a lot of pictures if you set it up for small pictures.  These go through the email nicely.  If you want a picture quality good enough to blow up in size without getting fuzzy, this is a good camera.  The large pictures take forever to go through the email but great for family mug-shots you can frame.

Fuji has maintained the 4/3 aspect ratio that is essential for good close ups. Many more expensive wide angle compact digital cameras that I own cannot take good close ups in macro setting, which are very important to me.
