I usually leave it in automatic, which works great, except in low light situations where you have to hold the camera steady, because of the slow shutter sport.  The camera has an antishake function, which helps.The X30 has a scene mode (SCN), in which you can choose from a number of preset scenes: sport, portrait, night, candelight, etc., (there are 13 scenes).  (I think the previous reviewer missed this).  Also, you can change the time before the camera shuts itself down - to up to five minutes of inactivity.The prices are coming down on these now, while the stock persists.  Its not too hard to find one for near $100 - pretty amazing for a 10 megapixel camera. I was so happy with the X30 I purchased another one, as a backup.I also have a dslr which I use for my serious photography, but this thing is so small that I kept it with me just in case as I take walks.  As I said, I am often very surprised at the quality of its photos.", "Date": "October 30, 2007"}, {"Title": "Don't buy this camera!", "Author": "Aleha Will", "ReviewID": "R8NHCBQ8VSPAK", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "It only takes a 1 minute stall for the camera to shut itself off.  It saves the battery, but a HUGE pain in the butt when you are positioning what you want to shoot and it shuts itself off continuously.  The flash is WAY too bright.  Every person I take a picture of is ghost white.  There are settings for movie and auto, but no setting for portrait, night landscape, etc.", "Date": "August 1, 2007"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": "Unavailable", "Features": "Image resolution up to 3264 x 2448\n4x digital zoom\nImage Stabilizer prevents picture blur\nRecords AVI unlimited movie clips up to 640 x 480 at 30fps\nIncludes Li-Ion battery and charger, storage case, strap, USB cable and software", "Name": "Vivitar VIVICAM-X30 10.0 MegaPixel Slim Camera with 3x Optical Zoom and 2.5 Inch TFT LCD", "ImgURL": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51hN%2Bx5FJlL._SX300_.jpg", "ProductID": "B000FQ06HG"}}
