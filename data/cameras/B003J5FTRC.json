So far so good; no problems other than the  battery has a short life. It drained completely when we were up in the mountains camping. No outlets anywhere, of course. Couldn't recharge it. Camera is very good, though.", "Date": "July 21, 2013"}, {"Title": "great first dlsr", "Author": "ksvecz", "ReviewID": "R1U8Z7FDFJMN3V", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "This was my first dslr and it was fantastic, very durable (it has taken quite a few hits and splashes) great image quality, very light, and fits the hand like a glove. And its innovations are only now being taken up by larger players (Canon and Nikon) and that's what i think Sony is great for. but not practical to stick with if one is going to go pro, i myself am moving onto canon. although, for any level amateur Sony is a good route. unfortunately poor low light performance even with high iso such as 3200 in this camera, and the on camera flash stinks. ive had mine since 2009 (its now 2013) and its held up great and has to have close to 100k actuations on it and going strong. I just wish Sony offered more competitive high end cameras. I truly believe Sony will continue to lead in tangential innovations, just watch Canon and Nikon pick them up.
