If lighting conditions are perfect I can get a clear photo; most of the time lighting conditions aren't perfect. I've talked to people about the blurry/grainy problem at a local camera shop and they believe that there is a defect in the internal stabilization. I contacted Olympus (which was a pain because even though their website said that they have online help, you really have to call a 1-800 number) and started the process to have it shipped to them (at my cost) to have them look at it and determine if there is anything wrong with it. At this point I feel as though it's better to write off the $150 I paid for it and just buy a better camera than dealing with Olympus' tedious procedures.I can't stress enough how unreliable this camera is for picture quality. If you're taking pictures of something important and prefer that they aren't blurry and grainy, I suggest a different camera.", "Date": "December 17, 2010"}, {"Title": "Decent Little Camera", "Author": "COMPUTER GEEK", "ReviewID": "REC00PSEMYBMD", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "The camera is very good looking, is slim and fits easily into any pocket. Picture quality wise, normal indoors and outdoor pictures are good to excellent quality. Flexible audio feedback for your actions (which is good for me because it was otherwise difficult to tell in outdoor conditions when the picture snapped). Reasonable delay between flash pics. The camera does a good job of selecting appropriate settings for most photo situations and you can override settings for extreme situations.

When I got the camera, the screen had a black mark on it that covered up the picture when I tried to review it.  The black mark continued to expand essentially covering up the view of the pictures.  I sent it back to the store and got a replacement.  The replacement was worse.  IT didn't have a black mark in the beginning, but after about 4 days, half the screen was blocked out with black.  The guy a the store said the megapixels burst and it's normal.  I say it's not normal it's defective.  The camera also wouldn't turn off at one point or respond to any button commands and I had to take out the battery and put it back in to make it work.  I got my  money back.

Also while on vacation or display screen got a big black mark on it for an unknown reason (never dropped and always kept in a case). When we tried to contact the manufacturer they asked for 75.00 just to LOOK at it and warned that it likely would not be covered anyways. We are moving on to a completely different company.

The still pictures are acceptably sharp but the color seems overly saturated.  The video function is where this camera really falls flat.  The zoom is jerky and the image at the long end is heavily pixellated...virtually unusable.

The compact size - it easily fits in a purse or pocket2. The price was good at the time I really needed a camera.The old adage of \"you get what you pay for\" is true. That being said, I wasn't expecting a professional quality camera, it isn't marketed as such, so please don't think it is.It is decent for what you pay for, it will take pictures in good lighting, low light- not so much.It has some auto scene settings which are kind of interesting.You can find a great DSLR camera for about $200 if you want one. (GE Brand). This Olympus is good for beginners or people who don't care about professional pictures. If you just want to have some family & pet photos for memories- then there is no need for a more expensive camera than this.14 MP sounds great, but in reality unless you are doing wall size, poster or professional prints- 8 is the most you should need - so if you do buy it, know that 14 MP will be HUGE and take up massive SD card space.Overall, this is a good camera and served me well when I used it, I just upgraded because I do a small hair accessories business which requires good pictures of my products and models, so am going to be purchasing a 16 MP DSLR.", "Date": "July 7, 2012"}, {"Title": "Was a great first camera.", "Author": "Jason Crawford \"Jason C\"", "ReviewID": "R3HIUUO0MFG1BK", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I bought this camera 6 months ago and adored it.

There are settings for low light, bright light, closeups etc.  My advise is to use the proper setting for the proper picture results.  I've not had any problems whatsoever with getting beautiful picture results when used properly and with the correct settings.  Can you pay a gazillion dollars for a better camera?  Sure.  But why?

I am more of an outdoor photographer - so I don't really know how this camera is with portraits.So if you are new into photography - and want a small, inexpensive camera that you can learn quickly - and are willing to do a little editing at times to make your photos brigher - this is the camera for you!4/5 stars.", "Date": "February 18, 2012"}, {"Title": "No really, DO NOT BUY IT in any color!!", "Author": "H.

I am an amatuer photographer and NEVER experienced such a crappy overall \"camera\". Then to top it off the lens just stop retracting and I now own a very expensive paperweight!!

Indoor and outdoor shots are fine.Press the shutter halfway down to activate the \"AF\" (auto focus) - you must have a green target mark before you snap the picture.  If the target square is red/orange, your shot will be out of focus!  There are 3 options for \"Focus Mode,\" I like \"Spot.\"The \"P\" (Program Auto) shooting mode works best for me.  I don't care for the \"Digital Image Stabilization\" (DIS) mode.  I have not tried all the \"SCN\" (Scene) modes; the \"Night\" was neat.  And the \"Magic\" effects were cool.  The \"Macro\" and \"Super Macro\" produced good results of the close-up flower shots I snapped.I really like that it utilizes a rechargeable Li battery - no need to spend $ on replacing disposable batteries.  You will have to insert an SD card (purchased separately) if you want to store more than a few pictures in the minuscule internal memory (normal for most cameras of this class and higher).Practice taking shots before you photograph your important event.

I thought at first maybe it just locked up so I took the battery out, by taking the battery out, it shut off but the lens was still extended.  I put the battery back in, and it turns on to show the same black screen and does the same thing.  I did this over and over to try to resolve it, nothing works.
