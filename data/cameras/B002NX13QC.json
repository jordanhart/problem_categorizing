{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Leica X1 After 4 Months of Use", "Author": "E. Qaisar \"EJQ\"", "ReviewID": "R2SZXGDJK2LQ6O", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I bought this camera in May 2010. Given the price, it took a while for me to take the plunge (I am not rich). Prior purchasing this camera, I was using DSLRs including  Nikon D40, D90, Pentax K100D Super and others. I wanted something light and small without sacrificing image quality. While M4/3 format has quite a few capable offerings (Panasonic GF1, Olympus Pen) I was/am not quite convinced that this is something I wanted to invest in. With Sony Nex, the range of small cameras with DSLR like image quality has increased and this is good for all of us.Now on to the Leica X1: I have used this camera heavily in the past four months and have taken over 4,000 shots. In my recent trip to Europe I took over 2,000 pictures in 8 days. If you want to stop reading at this point and get to the bottom line, here it is: This camera's image quality is stunning. The details, sharpness, colors and tonality is astounding. It surpasses my Nikon D40/ + Nikon 35mm f/1.8D combination by a wide margin (yes, I realize that D40 is 4-5 times cheaper). The output of the X1 easily matches Nikon D300/D300S.Details:Now that we have covered image quality, let us talk about other things.- Out of camera JPGs: Usable, but do not reflect what this camera is capable of. If you are a JPG shooter, do not bother with this camera.- DNG (RAW) Quality: The X1 is king-kong here. Processed properly in Lightroom (which is included in the price of X1), the resultant output from the DNGs is simply breathtaking. It would not be a stretch to say that X1 can easily stand upto the likes of Canon 5D Mk II at lower ISO (100-400). A friend of mine, who is an experienced photographer remarked that the outout of the X1 has a cinema like feel.- AF Accuracy: Very accurate. In particular, the spot focus mode is very impressive and allows you to have a pin-point focus on a dot if you want to.- Color Accuracy: Spot-on. While in Germany, I stopped at a camera dealer. They were demonstrating comparison shots (actual prints, not on screen) taken with the X1, G11, D90 and others taken under same conditions. The picture was that of a building across the street so I could see in real life what the subject looked like. X1 had the most accurate output: it was the only camera to have captured accurately very light pink tinge of color the wall of the building. The others had it all white.- Metering: Just like AF, very precise. Spot metering enables you to meter based on a very small area.- Shutter Noise: Very quiet. Perfect for shooting in church, museums or other places where shutter click sounds are frowned upon. So quiet in fact that X1 provides a \"false\" acoustic signal to simulate shutter click - I keep this disabled.- High ISO Quality: Upto ISO 800 is perfect. ISO 1600 from X1 is better than ISO 800 output of entry level DSLRs and all of the current M4/3s. I have taken some pretty good ISO 1600, long exposure (4sec, 8 sec and more) shots of Niagara Falls at night with the X1: this camera just does not get noisy. X1 maxes out at ISO 3200 which is a bit noisy but usable and much better than the likes of GF1 or Olympus Pen M4/3rs. In the compact camera world, Sony Nex is the only real challenger to the X1 in high ISO output quality at this time.- Zoom - this is to check if you are reading carefully. X1 has no zoom.- Ease of use / weight: X1 really shines here and this combined with the image quality would be the most important reason to get the X1. Dedicated buttons for speed, aperture, ISO, AF, WB, etc make changing settings very fast. Grip is ok and I have not felt the need for the separate hand-grip that Leica sells separately. One handed operation is easy. I have done many hours of shooting with one hand when it was raining on a recent trip and I had an umbrella in one hand and the X1 in other. Try that with a DSLR. I simply cannot imagine going out with a heavy DSLR and lenses now (unless I was a pro and did wedding shoots or other paid assignments that require loads of gear).- AF Speed / Writing speed: As covered in various reviews on numerous web sites, the AF speed is slow. There is quite a lag when you press the shutter and the time it takes for the camera to capture the shot and write it to the SD card. If AF speed/writing speed is paramount to you, do not buy this camera.- Writing mode: DNG (RAW) + JPG or JPG only. It is very strange that one cannot choose DNG only mode. In my case, I always capture both DNG and JPG. Having a JPG allows me to have a reference point when processing DNGs.- Image Stabilization (IS): Inferior as compared to cameras with optical stabilization. I don't use it. My Canon S90 has a much superior IS. If IS is a must for you, get a tripod instead of relying on the X1's IS. I keep IS switched off.- Battery life: average. If you intend to do a full day's worth of shooting, a second battery is a must. You can good non OEM batteries from eBay for $20 or so. No need to pay over $90 for \"original Leica\" battery.- Flash power: Inadequate for shots that need it as a primary source of illumination. Does not bother me as I rarely do shoots that rely on a powerful flash. X1's flash is adequate for fill purposes.- Build Quality: Good. Not stellar, but good.Overall:A camera's sole purpose is to take photographs and if final image quality in a small package is the deciding factor then X1 is the king of the hill as of today. Strange as it may sound, I feel that the only real contender in this space is the Sony Nex PROVIDED that Sony can come up with a good lens that actually does justice to the excellent sensor of the Nex series. X1 is not for you if you need loads of \"features\" in a camera: Panasonic and Sony will be a better fit you if you want \"features\".Buy the X1 if you absolutely need a small camera with  top of the line image quality right now. On the other hand, if you have a half-way decent camera already, then wait till the holiday season - I am expecting/hoping that Sony or some other independent lens maker will come up with a decent lens selection for the Nex that will narrow the gap with the X1. In any event, my X1 will be a keeper simply because of the excellent images it has allowed me to capture that will be treasured for a long time. I feel liberated by not having to worry about changing lenses, zooming or \"features\". I just take my X1 and start shooting.", "Date": "September 4, 2010"}, {"Title": "I am now a convert - Leica X1 rocks!", "Author": "Simon Berlyn", "ReviewID": "R2OWE03UM0F33E", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I have been looking at purchasing some form of Leica camera for the last year or so. Originally I was going to get a D-Lux4, but wasn't sold on the idea. The X1 was pushing my pricepoint but something about it intrigued me. I didn't know what to make of the fixed lens, the slow speed, the high price or the varying reviews. I read everything I could, watched everything on Youtube and finally decided on Friday I had to have one. I ordering with one day shipping and paced all morning long on Saturday until the doorbell rang at 11:30.I should preface this review by saying I am a professional architectural photographer and use a Canon 5DMarkII with a variety of L glass for my day job and have been a very satisfied Canon customer for many years and will continue to be. I was looking for a walk about camera for being creative and restoring my love of photography for the sake of loving photography. I bought a Canon G11 recently and like it a lot as a tool for holidays, snaps of family etc but didn't love it or want to use it for the sake of using it.The minute I opened the box and held the X1 in my hand I felt an urge to go out and shoot for no other reason than pure enjoyment. I charged the battery, impatiently pacing as it charged, read the instructions and then set out with a friend to Abbott Kinney in Venice for some street test shots. It has been a terrible grey weekend in LA so I thought this would really test the Leica.It took a little while to get used to the camera just because it was different to what I was used to but once I got used to it, I realized it made perfect sense. The dials are exactly what you need, the buttons are minimal but do the right things. The myriad of buttons you get on the G11 faded away to the all important shutter speed and aperture setting on top. From the first images displayed on the screen I had a feeling I was going to like the results although you can never tell until you download the images. I shot indoors, outdoors, people, buildings, flowers, textures you name it. The results were way beyond what I had hoped for. It is very hard to explain it. The color was so real it triggered my mind back to when I had seen it that day. The images were sharp and crisp and the depth made them look 3D. The images seemed alive to me, I wanted to look at them and keep looking at them. If I had taken my 5D out, images would have looked flat and lifeless, I could have made them look good in Photoshop but that's not the point.The various modes control the look of the jpegs and work very well. I especially like the vivid for color on a dull day and the black and white high contrast for everything. This camera when shooting RAW also take a jpeg image. I always use RAW for work and expected to do so here. The RAW images are spectacular and easy to work with in photoshop. The jpegs had mixed results. The first day of shooting I didn't like the results but after tweaking the settings today I found setting I liked and for the first time in as long as I can remember was producing B&W; jpegs straight from the camera that I loved. Of course I like to tweak them but straight from the camera, amazing results.The reason for this long winded review is to illustrate why I bought this camera and what I wanted it for. This camera is not the best solution for someone who wants a fully auto point and shoot for family shots or kid action shot or a fully auto at all. Yes it does fully auto but that is not the point. This camera is for \"street\" shooting, for shooting for the sake of shooting, for being creative, for pros to remind themselves why they love photography. It is subtle, it doesn't disturb people when you pull it out like an SLR can do. The fixed lens is fantastic, it provides such sharp images I am willing to trade not have a zoom any day. It makes me work to get the shot, it is so easy to be lazy with zoom. You get out of this camera what you put in, plain and simple. This camera is not for most people, it is for the few that want to work for the image and enjoy the process. The shortfalls you read about elsewhere have not concerned me while I have used it. It is not the fastest camera, autofocus is a little slow but for me it takes longer to frame the image I want, so a second to focus is of no concern. The manual focus is great with the 'loupe' on-screen to help you. As a photographers tool it is beautifully designed and a breeze to use. I will take it everywhere with me and it will become my go to camera for any creative shot I want to capture. The price makes it seem expensive but after using it I am happy to have paid the price and think it is well worth it. This is my first Leica but it will certainly not be the last!! Time to start saving for the M9.", "Date": "October 17, 2010"}, {"Title": "Leica X1 a New Favorite", "Author": "Louis H. Hamel Jr. \"Lawyer, Reader of Psychoa...", "ReviewID": "R3UZO89A8TD6U1", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "In mid-March 2010 I spent a week abroad with the Leica X1 and the Leica M9.  The X1 competes well with the superlative M9 and among the results of my trip the photos taken with the X1 -- many in the fog and at night, all hand-held -- are among the best of some outstanding photos being requested by people who see them.  Charging the battery using the (provided) European plug inserted in place of the American plug was (contrary to one review) much better than using a hinged American plug, which would require a separate adapter, spacing the charger too far from the bathroom wall receptacle.  At home, also, photos of family and little kids moving around fast indoors at birthday party and similar events yielded an unexpectedly large number of superior photos which coulc be cropped aggressively to get a no-noise individual portrait out of a group shot.  This little camera is more fun to use than most any other camera I've ever owned. I would compare it with the superlative Rollei TLR cameras of a couple of decades ago.  The X1 is well worth the price.", "Date": "April 15, 2010"}, {"Title": "A Photographer's Compact", "Author": "Artemesia", "ReviewID": "R1GYUFVN4HCTFQ", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "The greatest drawbacks with this camera are the price and that it has no optical zoom. The payback is that the image quality is astonishing - especially for a compact camera. With a large CMOS sensor as found in larger digital SLRs and 12 megapixels, you can obtain raw image files in Adobe DNG format of about 18 MB and JPEGS of about 5 MB with beautiful image quality. You don't need to magnify your images to a very large size though to see the quality of the lens. I carry my X1 in my (large) purse, and keep an optical viewfinder in the hotshoe - with the viewfinder, it is on the large side for a purse, without it would be perfect.I have found the autofocusing and metering to be very good, but the user has everything from totally manual control of exposure and focusing to completely automated operation. I have found this camera to be excellent for landscape and close-up (not macro) work. Closest macro is only 30cm, but the results are superb. Portraits would be good I think with this camera. It's not as good at indoor party scenes, and it wouldn't be my camera of choice for sports (too slow, no zoom).I had to relinquish my old Nikon because without reading glasses I could no longer see the 1\" screen images clearly or read the menu options. This camera has a nice large 2.7\" screen with big font and highly legible menu options. Note however that due to the small size of the camera, the font on the small top dials is small and difficult to read - especially in low light. However, the LCD screen shows the shutter speed and aperture stop in a slightly larger font which is more legible. This may seem trivial, but to those of us who need reading glasses but cannot wear them when out and about with a camera, this is actually a huge plus. Many electronics and software designers only seem to acknowledge the existence of young people with perfect eyes - they use tiny font and icons so small they appear to rest of us as colored dots. Not so this camera. Good for Leica!The display screen is not of a quality equal to some other cameras with screens of this size and should be far better for the price but it is satisfactory and large.The layout is beautifully simple for anyone used to old-fashioned SLRs with shutter speed and aperture dials on the top plate. Each has an A setting giving SP auto, AP auto, program mode (both dials on A!), and fully manual exposure. Beautiful in its simplicity. The on-off switch is located around the shutter release button, and has four simple positions - off, on (single shot), on (continuous shooting), and on (delayed shutter release). So too the menu is flat and so you don't have to dig to find options. This is helped by the camera having clearly labeled dedicated buttons for many major functions. It is relatively simple to find and use all the camera's functions - no holding in two buttons simultaneously while executing a complicated choreographed dance after consulting the instruction manual for an hour to select a specific buried function! This type of camera benefits from a basic technical knowledge of photography since it is laid out based on photography basics like shutter speed etc. and not based on sunset, sports, landscape modes etc.The camera has good low-light capabilities with relatively little grain up to 800 ISO. I have taken crystal-clear images of cityscapes and artificially-lit (high-contrast) night shots without flash or tripod at ISO 3200 , and they are beautiful. This partially offsets the fact that the built-in mini-flash is low power - good for table scenes and dimly lit interiors and fill-in flash.I'd recommend an external viewfinder for the hotshoe - all LCD display screens become difficult to discern in bright sunlight, and there are just times when it is more convenient to look through a viewfinder. But the Leica Brightfinder viewfinder fits so tightly into the hotshoe, if you use one don't bank on swapping it out on a regular basis for an external flash.I've used the camera at an air temperature of -7F (-22C) for 15 minute periods and down to -35F in Minneapolis - it seemed that the electronics slowed down a little and the battery level temporarily dropped in the cold as you'd expect. The camera seems to work quite well otherwise. Battery life is not very impressive if you keep the display turned on (and you have to) - I'd recommend having a spare battery.Gripes: Some of my previous gripes were fixed by the firmware upgrade which was excellent. The following remain: 1. If you turn off the screen to save battery power, half-cocking the shutter does not temporarily turn on the screen to show shutter speed, aperture, ISO info etc. The only indication that the photo will probably be satisfactory is a green light just within view (an excellent idea by the way) which indicates successful focusing. However, if the photograph will be under or overexposed, the camera happily gives you the green light which depends only on successful focusing. 2. The camera only gives focusing distance and depth of field information in manual focusing mode. (One needs to attend to depth of field with this camera - you can obtain wonderful sharp focus with background defocused and nice bokeh, but you need to work to obtain large depth of field if you need it.) 3. When using manual exposure, the auto ISO setting is unavailable - I think the option of manual exposure but with auto ISO would be useful. 4. If you take a manual exposure in low light, the meter reading doesn't change when you turn on the flash and set focus by half-pressing the shutter-release button. This results in overexposure for nearby subjects. Better to use auto or program mode with the flash. 5. The electronic image stabilization doesn't seem very useful - I haven't been able to detect much difference with it turned on or off. 6. In manual focusing mode, the focusing assist screen disappears way too quickly after the last adjustment and has to be retriggered by pressing a button or changing one's carefully selected focus with the wheel. The frame is also rather small. 6. The electronic image stabilization and the face detection autofocus modes seem to be a waste of time.Of these gripes, gripe #1 is the most serious in my opinion.I like that the camera comes with Adobe Photoshop Lightroom - it does less damage to your images than cheaper image-manipulation programs which can reduce file-size etc. and you can work with the DNG files without changing them to produce non-archival file formats like JPEG, TIFF etc. with images adjusted as you please. Unless you print your images, you'll need a beautiful display monitor to benefit most from the quality of the camera.It is difficult to describe the images from this camera - they draw one in, and are a pleasure to view. They are like seeing the scene itself in real life - the vivid color and the high-contrast black-and-white film modes (which affect the JPEG images but not raw DNG files) are particularly pleasing. After decades of cameras with zooms, I'm now having to frame my photographs more carefully: I have been astonished at how different the very same scene taken from a slightly different view changes the entire feel of a photo. When I get my images up on the big screen, one shot will be far more interesting than the others even though it is taken from only a marginally different view. Clearly I have a lot to learn yet about photography!The design of the camera is so very crystal-clear, the layout so intuitive, the camera so easy to use (if you understand the technical basics of photography), that one can focus on the photography - the camera becomes an extension of self. The camera makes you want to use it. The lack of zoom forces you to think about your photograph, you become more engaged in the process. This is a compact camera for the art of photography - a joy to use. It's not going to be the camera for everyone but for me it was an emotional choice and has brought back the pleasure of photography without lugging an SLR around.I love my X1. I've been updating this review. For now, still five stars after eight months' use.Update: I have just reviewed my first vacation photographs and am absolutely delighted. The quality of the photos is breathtaking. I can honestly say that it is very surprising how little the lack of telephoto capability has affected my photography. I suppose I just take - and create- a different kind of photograph now, accepting that some photos are just impossible. On my vacation, I really took control of the camera, manually choosing shutter-speed/aperture combinations and ISO for each subject, and using spot or 11 point auto-focus modes appropriate to the situation. Doing this, the camera really comes into its own behaving like a little M9 and giving superb results. You can do this without too much fiddling (perhaps less than 30 seconds to set up for a situation) once you know the camera.", "Date": "November 16, 2010"}, {"Title": "Leica X1: Probably the best camera in its class", "Author": "Chaiporn Vithessonthi", "ReviewID": "R1QBGIDJQQUKY5", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Suddenly I had an urge to share my experience with the Leica X1 camera which has been with me since the end of October 2010. I had been literally in (photography) exile over the past ten years since I stopped shooting with film cameras back in the late 1990s. I had put my longest-serving film camera, a Pentax Spotmatic and a prime lens, on the shelf when I was becoming too busy at work. Since then I had some experience shooting with a few digital cameras but I had never owned one. I didn't really like what I saw in digital cameras when it became more popular in the early 2000s. Image quality was basically poor. But again, I compared them to the image quality of a decent 35mm film camera (such as a Nikon FM2). It was perhaps an unfair comparison but it showed that I'd better retrieve my film camera off the shelf and start shooting again, rather than getting myself an expensive-but-low-quality camera.Time did really fly. Fast forwarding to July 2010. I unexpectedly bought my first digital camera when I came across a Panasonic Lumix GF1 while I was browsing shops at the airport during my trip to London. The GF1 with a 20mm prime lens looks like a range finder (RF) camera (of course, the GF1 isn't), which will suite my type of photography. I know a SLR camera (and now a DSLR camera) is much more flexible than a RF camera and can outperform a good RF camera in many areas. But again, I like a RF for what it is and how I use my camera. So I bought the GF1 with a 20mm prime lens and took it with me to London. I felt good about shooting photos again as a way to liberate myself from pressure at work. Shooting with the GF1 was great but its image quality, though very good, cannot compete against any decent film camera. Then, a search for a better tool kicked off and I started looking for something better.Having come across the Leica X1 on the internet, I read a couple of reviews and finally got myself the camera, knowing all its limitations. My relative had shot with both medium format cameras (a Mamiya and a Hasselblad) and some Leica cameras so I learned a lot about film photography back in the late 1980s and the early 1990s. I thought about the X1 and Steve Huff's review has been very useful [...]. I would encourage those who like to know more about the Leica to read his review. I am not a professional photographer, so what I try to share with you is my experience with the camera in action as an amateur photographer who returns to the photography world after a long-term exile.I have heard many people saying that the autofocus of the Leica X1 is so slow. Well, it may be slow to some or very slow to others. For me, it is not bad at all. Given that all of my film cameras had no AF, I certainly have no problem with the speed of the Leica X1 autofocus. At the best of time, I could manual focus my RF cameras faster than auto focus on my X1 but such time has long gone (but it may be back one day...one fine day). I have missed many shots when the X1's autofocus was not fast enough but, well, I had missed many shots when I was out shooting with any manual focus film camera back in my heyday (when I had to do four things almost simultaneously: setting the shutter speed and the f-stop, focusing and composing a shot).Handling of the X1 is superb. Setting the aperture, the shutter speed and the ISO is very easy. I don't care about scenery modes (apparently mandatory functions in a compact or DSLR camera), so it does not matter to me one bit whether such fancy (or marketing gimmick) functions exist in any Leica camera. In fact, I don't fancy such things in the Leica Land and I am glad that there is no such thing in the X1 or any Leica M cameras. The art of photography should be preserved as our mind and brain should be developed to actually think before even put the camera on an eye level. The digital world has taken so much away from our brain development. Kids growing up in this digital world appear to operate in a different mental model (it is a topic of which I'd rather not deal with in this review).In terms of image quality, I am very happy with what the X1 has produced so far. Most of the images produced from the X1 blow the best images produced by my GF1 out of the water. As I am not a pro and may not be one, it is very unlikely that I would get myself a Leica M9 and a Leica 35mm Summicron ASPH, which will put me back about $10,000 ($6995 for the M9 and $2995 for the 35mm Summicron).At the end of the day, shooting images with the X1 suddenly brings back good memories again!", "Date": "February 3, 2011"}, {"Title": "Out of this world Wonderful!", "Author": "Tigertail \"Robin\"", "ReviewID": "R17TN3WJE5SCMM", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Are you like me?  Do you find yourself cropping photos for better composition only to see them pixelated when you enlarge them, even to the relatively small size of 8x10?  This was the dilemma I found myself in, especially when processing photos taken with a zoom lens.  I thought to myself, \"What kind of camera do I need to compensate for this method of photo processing?\"  To my mind, it seemed that I would need a camera that (1) has extremely high image quality and (2) performs well in low light (I mean, who doesn't want to take beautiful night shots, right?).I read as many reviews on the Leica X1 as I could find on the web and in magazines, as well as reviews for other cameras, and almost cried when I settled on the Leica X1, due to the expense, but boy, is it ever worth it!  This camera delivers!  It does exactly what I want it to do--sharp, gorgeous photos even when cropped severely and the color is just amazing...must be that Leica look (I'm serious--some photos look like a work of art, and I am only an amateur photographer).  By all means, buy it if you can afford it.  After all, it's the photo image that counts.  Oh, did I mention it comes with Adobe PhotoShop Lightroom, a very intuitive photo processor?

For this kind of money I was expecting (almost) the best.It's a very slow camera from every point of view: slow LCD refresh rate, slow LCD playback, slow autofocus that tends to fail in low light. Anyone who's considering buying this camera knows that there is no OIS or built-in viewfinder: I am sick of those \"old fashioned\" photographers who claim that such things aren't needed by \"real photographers\". Again - with such a price-tag - I would expect Leica to keep up with technology in terms of both optics-electronics interface and firmware, and I do think that OIS and built-in, high-resolution, electronic viewfinder would further expand the camera's capabilities in low light and also provide feedback on the current exposure/ISO,aperture settings without having to check the LCD/wheels and compose again. I am also disappointed by the manual focus control: I would have been happier with a ring on the barrel and with the possibility of further zooming on my subject to adjust focus (GF1 allows two levels of zoom, X1 only one level, which sometimes is not sufficient).Some of the button I use often (ISO) are on the left hand side of the LCD. This makes changing the setting tricky when holding the barrel with my left hand and have my right index finger on the shutter: having these buttons on the right hand side would allow me to change these settings while holding the camera ready to shoot.Image Quality: Judging on the basis of my raw images, the lens is sharp but has considerable barrel distortion. The sensor is capable of producing usable images at ISO as high as 3200.In conclusion, I am still waiting for \"my camera\", a tool that I could truly feel as an extension of my brain and heart.

It is a joke and not worth the money.  350 big ones for an optical viewfinder that has no diopter???Don't get the horrible leather case Leica sells with it that has absolutely no utiltity and can't even keep the lens cap in place.However, despite the complaints I list above, this is a great camera and no other camera its size will compare.", "Date": "October 6, 2010"}, {"Title": "Three Stars for Value, Five Stars for Everything Else.", "Author": "Ms_Ladi \"...just wandering the world.\"", "ReviewID": "R1L2N51NLAKNX9", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Three Stars for Value, Five Stars for Everything Else.I'll just get to the meat and potatoes of this review.Looks just like the steel gray mini M9.  Makes me wish I had the M9 versus the M8 (yes, just for looks!).  Very nice and sleek, definitely not boxy and boring as the online reviews made it appear.  The camera is sturdy for a point and shoot, and fits well in my hands.  I tested the dials.  They are not flimsy on my camera as has been mentioned in previous internet reviews.  I have small fingers, however, so I may not trigger a dial to move as other shooters.  The screen is BAD.  I'm sorry, but for $2K, I need a $2K screen.  At least 920K dots.  I'm disappointed at the screen...the subjects appeared grainy and the screen kept locking up as I tried to maintain focus.  This is subpar.  The other buttons and the flash are easy to use, nice and fits well on the camera.Features are not overwhelming.  As a mini M, I'm not surprised at the simplistic usability.  I like it...but for a point and shoot, I have a nagging feeling I could be missing something.  I don't know:  perhaps the  \"kids and pets\" feature would just make me feel at home.  That's a joke.  However, I would l like zoom features...5x if possible.  The menus and buttons are easy to use, although I would like a toggle button (versus button/menu) for AF/Macro similar to the D-Lux 4.Image quality is indeed SLR-like.  Reviews and comments online usually have images attached that have been photoshopped to a degree.  My out of camera jpeg photos are wonderful!  I guess I had to see this to believe it.  I have a D-Lux 4, and the difference is very evident (not to discredit the D-Lux 4).  Now, is the image quality $2K worth?  All of Leica's cameras are incredibly overpriced, but I know of no other point-and-shoot that gives the image quality of this camera.  I had a hard time believing it before it got into my hands.  Still, my answer is leading to, \"no, still too expensive\".AF:  The minimum focusing distance is far, almost two feet for accurate focusing.  Ensure AF Macro is enabled for those \"close-up\" situations.  In this manner, zoom would really be seen as a positive in order to get those close personal shots.  It would be difficult to hand this camera to someone (a point/shooter) and say, \"please take my photo...no wait, move farther\"  For my M8.2, I understand when folks have a hard time using it, but for the X1?ISO quality is superb.  Blown up on my screen, it's very comparable to my 7D, with a Leica flare to it.What I've stated are the few things that I value; there are plenty more pros to this camera.  In the end, like most Leicas, the X1 is definitely not a camera for the budget, quick shooter.  To the ones who just want a point and shoot to capture moments, the price of the X1 is difficult to justify.  One can even get an Micro Four-Thirds camera with excellent image quality for 25% the price of the X1.  This camera is out of stock as we speak, but perhaps a lower price would make it maniacal to the masses.  Also, a closer minimum focal distance, and a better screen.  But I cannot let myself unhand this fine piece of hardware.  I find myself foregoing essential pieces of clothing, toothpaste and soap, and a few meals a day in order to have the chance to master the equipment so painstakingly made from the company called Leica.

But it's near grain-free,  high ISO shooting at night is incredible,  its compact size will make you happy you aren't lugging a backpack of dslr gear, its sleek design is sexy, and I'm sure it will impress people with its picture quality and when they hear how much it costs they will be impressed with you for affording it (if that's how you get your rocks off).The long version: I am a professional cinematographer and use canon 5d mk2s and 7ds for still and video work often.  I've used Arri Alexa cameras, Red cameras and and all sorts of 35mm motion picture cameras. Needless to say I feel I have a good eye for good glass and good photos.I ordered the Leica X1, currently owning a t2i with L-series 24-70, 80-200 IS, the popular tokina wide angle, and a 30mm 1.4 sigma for really dark shooting.  Upon arrival of the X1 i snapped some pics on the internal memory (which will give you 10 pics worth in an emergency) indoors at night, out in the street at night, etc.I downloaded the pics to my macbook pro-pretty glossy but nothing magical.  Snapped some more, cranked up the ASA to 3200, played with the manual focus-pretty fun, played with the saturation and contrast settings, and I did side by side looks in iphoto at the jpeg vs dng files.  manual adjustment wheels of f stop and shutter were nice to see on a digital...All good stuff, but not 2k worth. (keep reading however...)\"Why not buy a 5d if i really care about a photo or just use my iphone with hipstamatic otherwise\" I said \"This is an overpriced status symbol (lacking the optical viewfinder I love in 35mm Leicas)  I'll stick with my t2i..\"Sent the X1 back next day without blinking-if money was no object I would have kept it but I can't see buying pricey things that don't wow me- i can use Canon t2i's as disposable cameras and not have equaled the price of an X1.But going on a trip the next day and I was already missing it, here's why:1) I compared the night shots to canon t2i photos and a friend's 5d mk 1 pics hanging around.  The X1 at ISO 3200 had less grain than my T2i at 800.  The way the X1 processes info is in fact magical.  I was shooting the T2i through a $1400 l series lens and the grain was electrified at 800, the X1, flawless.2)The compact size is easy to bring along, and unobtrusive.  No one is bothered by the little thing, the t2i 7d, 5d etc becomes a project.  And at something like a wedding you get the odd label of being a techy camera guy if you sling a big camera, and have to carry it around all night. Traveling with the X1 is great.Before the X1, when a photo op out a car window came up or something i wanted a good shot of I found myself saying well the t2i is too big of a project to break out of the bag, this moment isn't THAT important, so an iPhone pic would suffice.  The Leica fills that void perfectly3)Addressing the amazon review cons lastly: FOCUS:the focusing isn't slow, it's accurate.  Im used to always living on manual focus on DSLRs, I shoot video alot so I never have my lenses on AUTO, The Leica X1 is the first camera I trust to do that on.FIXED LENS: yes a fixed lens, yes a bit of a head scratch, brow raise... but think of the Leica X1 camera as a 7d or 5d with a canon fixed prime 35mm lens that takes awesome dark photos with natural looking highlights that fits in the palm of your hand.Summary:I'd rather have some stunning photos to document my life in a take anywhere camera than lug along a DSLR and tons of lenses forever. The opposite extreme is true too, instagram and hipstamatic is cool but the X1 will put the photos of your own history in the making, in a class above.

Like so many others, I travelled a lot and got tired of lugging my BIG F4 and Hasselblad with 5-10 kgs of lens and kit around. I stopped shooting for a number of years because of that.Just before the birth of my children earlier this year, I was looking for a competent compact performer capable of delivering high IQ to capture those precious moments when the babies arrive and came across Leica X1 in my search. Like many, I did tons of research before sinking 2000 big one into this little camera instead of a D300! The rest is history.I love the X1 and finally understand the Leica 'look' that Leica fanatics have been talking for years.Yes, the focusing is slow, it won't fire 10 fps and it is definitely not for running kids, sport and wildlife shotting sessions but that is besides the point when one buy the X1.I rediscovered photography in the digital era with a camera that reminded me of my fine art school's days with my beloved Nikon FM2.After setting the X1 on full manual, the X1 requires a more considered approach to taking photos instead of just point and shoot! The built quality is unequal when comparing to the 'disposable' Nikons and Canons of the digital world.The X1 rekindled my love of photography and I have been shooting everyday since I bought it 5 months ago. It is not a sub-compact but small enough for me to carry it everywhere unlike my Nikon SLR and Hasselblad... It is a perfect second everyday camera for a professional or serious photo nut!Well, I loved the creamy soft Leica look with its bokeh so much that I went out and bought a M8 + 35mm Summicron a month later...and am now thinking of sinking my teeth into a Noctilux F1/50mm.I guess Leica's marketing works after all by creating a real entry level Leica (not counting the Panasonic Leicas)for people like me to get a real taste of the Leica experience!As for the \"Leica\" bashers of the world, try it for yourself first instead of mindlessly dismissing the brand as being a snobbish, expensive rich boy's toy.The act of taking a photo with a Leica is a journey in itself. Nikon/Canon fanboys and fangirls prefer to get from A to B as quickly as they can while Leica fans enjoy the slower and more deliberated journey.I don't want to do a quarter mile drag in 13s and prefer a slower winding ocean drive with a fine machine and a manual stick drive.Yes, I love my Leicas for everyday personal memories that I took myself... and not by a microprocessor in a camera!", "Date": "April 8, 2011"}, {"Title": "Great images but expensive and very limited use", "Author": "George", "ReviewID": "R1ASW9BX7EK0A", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "If absolute image quality is more important than money and versatility, this camera is worth a look.  It is a camera for people who want classic Leica images, but this is offset by unnecessary and incomprehensible limitations so severe that the camera borders on a joke.The camera is designed to be small, light and take photos comparable to the best 35mm digital cameras.  Mostly it succeeds.  Useable images are better than all but the most expensive DSLRs. I also have a Canon 1Ds III and it shoots a more detailed image and is less grainy at every ISO but the Leica has slightly better color and is much more portable.  Color and high ISO performance are better than a micro four thirds.Unfortunately, Leica's engineers quit there and could even be suspected of sabotaging the camera.  It may have the most limited range and usefulness of any camera on the market.  It only takes photos of stationary objects or some moving things at a distance, and uses a fixed, non interchangeable 35 mm equivalent lens.  The lens is classic Leica, very clear corner to corner.  But with no zoom many shots will be missed.The biggest frustration is the unbelievably slow focus -- maybe the slowest of any auto focus camera currently available.  It makes the X1 useless for shooting kids or animals or anything else moving close to the camera.  To make things worse, the camera uses an intense orange light to focus so a kid or animal that is still initially will usually be moving away or squinting by the time the camera is ready to shoot.  In dark light it is like getting hit with a laser making it nearly impossible to shoot any living thing.  It is hard to understand why one of the world's most expensive compact cameras would have this problem.  Every competing camera proves there is no inherent technological issue limiting focus speed to this degree or requiring such a disturbing focus light.The same poor engineering applies to the few additional features added to the camera such as face detection and motion stabilization, both of which are essentially useless.  Face recognition is a great feature in a camera with fast focus but pointless in an X1 unless the face doesn't move for several seconds and can stand the orange focusing laser.  Motion stabilization is a really bogus feature.  It uses a system that takes two shots in succession then combines them.  it doesn't work.  It sometimes produces worse images with ghosts.  What's up with that?So why would anyone pay way beyond top dollar for a camera with such big and incomprehensible flaws?  Is this a trick to reveal the number of irrational of people who will buy anything made by Leica?  Is this suffering part of the Leica mystique?In fairness many similar sized cameras are not useful for shooting close moving things (a micro four thirds like a Panasonic G, GH or GF are much better for that) and just as you rage at this camera's flaws and start to return it you think about those great colors and detail and low light qualities.  It is a hard choice.  What are a few great images from a small light camera worth to you?", "Date": "December 11, 2010"}, {"Title": "Remarkable -- Images as Good or Better than My D300 at 24mm", "Author": "Cynthia", "ReviewID": "R2YCM9OMXDNFLS", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I am a keen photographer, shooting semi-professionally, with a Lightroom catalog of almost 40,000 images.  My primary camera is a Nikon D300 with a slew of lenses -- 18-200 zoom; 12-24 zoom; 60mm macro and 10.5mm fisheye.  I really love my D300 and consider it my primary camera when quality counts.  However, it is fairly heavy and cumbersome to lug around, especially when using an Expodisk and polarizing filter for best quality outdoor scenic shots.  I also shoot quite a few HDR images, so frequently use a tripod.  I've tried for some time now to complement the Nikon with a pocket-size camera capable of producing high-quality digital images.I've owned at least a dozen of them, including cameras from Canon, Sony, Panasonic, Olympus and Casio.  I also have a Panasonic GF-1 with the 20mm pancake lens and two Lumix zoom lenses - 7 to 14 and 14 to 140.  Most of these cameras produced reasonable quality images, especially those which offered a RAW image processing option, but nothing to compare with my Nikon D300.  The GF-1 is a gem but a bit \"in betwixt and in between,\" as it not pocket size (even with the 20mm pancake lens) and not IMO the equal of the D300 in terms of image quality.This fall, before a trip overseas, I began considering the purchase of a new pocket-sized camera to replace my Olympus XZ-1.  I stumbled onto the Leica X1, read a few reviews and was intrigued, but was put off by the high price and did not purchase the camera.  Shortly before I left I began dreading the thought of lugging my entire Nikon kit around, so broke down and purchased the X1, vowing to return it if it did not meet my high [price-based] expectations.My initial observation was that the packaging for the camera was quite over-the-top, rather like the box in which a fancy watch would come, and a real waste of money.  The camera itself was small enough to fit into the pocket of my jacket and lightweight, perhaps a bit too lightweight.  I was intrigued but not impressed.All of this changed when I went to actually take pictures with the camera.  The controls are incredibly intuitive and the easiest to use of any digital camera I have ever owned.  One need not read the instruction manual to determine how to shoot in program mode, aperture priority mode or shutter priority mode, it is that intuitive.  As others have noted, the LCD screen is not as bright or large as one might hope, the controls have an unfortunate habit of moving inadvertently, and there is no zoom lens.  The images, however, are remarkable.  Coloration is subtle and extremely accurate, resolution and acuity are exceptional, the autofocus is unbelievably true and images taken in low light are exceptional.While on my trip I shot some identical test images with both my D300 (with the 18 to 200 zomm set at 24mm) and the X1.  I also shot some additional test images on my return, using a tripod and self-timer to ensure that I had a set of images, taken under various conditions, that would provide an accurate basis for comparison.  I imported the RAW images into Lightroom without any processing and compared them side by side using Lightroom's \"compare\" function.  In every single case the Leica images were chosen in blind tests (I removed all of the identification data from the screen images and then asked colleagues to tell me which of the two they preferred).  At higher magnification the Leica X1 images were, unbelievably, sharper than those captured by the D300.  Frankly, I still cannot believe the quality of these images and am stunned that they are at least as good, if not better, than those produced by the D300.One other point that may be arcane but is important to me - I take a fair number of images for HDR processing using the Photomatix program exported through Lightroom.  I have obtained some really excellent images using the HDR approach.  With the D300, I always use a tripod because it simply is not feasible to hand-hold the camera for three successive exposures.  While playing around with the X1, I noticed it has an auto bracketing option, so I tried that while hand-holding the camera and then exported them through Lightroom into the Photomatix HDR program.  I created several really stunning HDR images just by pressing the shutter button while hand-holding the camera.  Unbelievable.So while it is true that this camera has some fairly significant constraints, if high-quality images are your goal, then I would say it literally has no peer.  I am blown away by this little gem.One last comment - I purchased through Amazon the Rainbowimaging Auto Lens Cap, which installed easily and works well.  I recommend that accessory for this camera.Lastly, these are my subjective personal opinions, not based on any scientific study.  I am simply an avid long-time photographer in love with this camera!UPDATE --After two months of intensive use of this camera, I like it more than ever.  Its compact size is convenient and the controls remain intuitive and easy-to-use.  Best of all, the images are fantastic, significantly better than I ever expected for a camera of this size and ease of use.  I just took some pictures of the white ice crystal frost that developed last night where I live, and the detail is amazing.  I then took three differently exposed pictures for an HDR output (simple to accomplish in the X1), and with a minimum of processing in Lightroom 3 and Photomatix Pro 4, obtained a stunning result worthy of framing.  Quite simply, this is the greatest camera, pound for pound and dollar for dollar, I've ever owned.SECOND UPDATE --For my next book shoot, I just acquired a Nikon D700 (full frame 24 x 36 sensor) with 16-35 and 24-120 FX lenses.  I wanted the new D800 but didn't think I would be able to obtain one before I leave.  The D700 is a superb camera; however, based on my standard [non-scientific] test of shooting a set of HDR images off my back deck, it is no sharper than the X1 -- and the D700 shots were taken on a tripod while the only stabilization I used for the Leica was a SteadePod.  Maybe I just got a \"production perfect\" sample with X1, but it is extraordinary.As another reviewer noted, apparently the black covering on these cameras is prone to lifting; the black cover on mine is beginning to lift near the LCD screen.

I was pleased in a similar way with the Sigma DP1 but this camera is much better in every way. I know all about the negatives when you compare the camera in price, speed, etc. But ultimately what camera do you grab and what will fit in a pocket or bag and when you have the opportunity to take a photograph? Is the camera up to being set and will it take a photo that will live on as something approaching artistic? Is there enough resolution and dynamic range to post process?

The camera can be used as a point and shoot, but I do not recommend that. Apart from amazing image quality, where the camera really shines is in the full manual controls that are very easy and fast to adjust.  Shutter and aperture are dials on top.  ISO and white balance each have a dedicated button, with another button to adjust the AF mode.  You can also switch to macro with one button.  I don't know why mass market DSLR cameras have such complicated controls by comparison.  Amateur photographers should not be afraid of this camera.The image quality is amazing, especially in RAW.  (However, printing RAW files is expensive, and cannot be done at your local Costco, so you may have to use the jpeg super fine setting for snap shots.)  The colors on the jpeg formatted photos are a little too saturated, and you do miss a lot of detail.  I use a larger a larger memory card and shoot in RAW and jpeg so I have a choice of what to use.I look at this camera as a bargain M9.  You get the nearly silent shutter, the full size sensor, the high-quality build, and Leica optics for thousands less.  The X1 is also small enough to be carried on your wrist and used like a point and shoot.  If you know how to use this camera and appreciate what you are getting, it is a bargain.  Also, don't be afraid to buy a used \"made in Germany\" Leica that has been well cared for.I have not compared the X1 to the Fuji X100 or Sony NEX.  The Fuji is close enough in price to a gently used X1, so I thought the X1 was the better choice.  The Sony NEX has a full size sensor and is cheaper, but I am not a fan of Sony cameras.  The Leica is simply a pleasure to use.  Try it, you'll like it.N.B. this is not a camera for photographing sports or kids doing funny things, because the AF is not very fast.  There are super zooms and DSLRs for well under $800 that perfect for that.  Fuji and Panasonic/Leica make great super zooms.

I didn't know what I didn't know because the camera made up for so much of my own deficiency. But I learned to look for the shot with that camera.Been shooting for the last 20 years with a Speed Graphic. Now, that is a machine that will force you to learn stuff, and reward you for learning it right. And it does the highest-resolution digital photography in the world--just use fine-grain film, give your image a good sized enlargement, and scan it piece by piece. I have dozens of my favorites stored on my hard drive done in this way. I shudder to think of the equivalent megapixel count it would take to get these.I have been looking (and looking, and looking) for a digital camera that can make photographs in the digital realm like a Speed Graphic can do with modern film in the analog world. I've just about given up on that. But this little tiny camera (compared to the Graflex) does some amazing things. The lens is typical Leica--stop it down above 6 and you can't help but get some razor sharp keepers. Fixed-lens cameras, properly made, are the sharpest cameras in the world. With the X1 it's down to your ability. The camera isn't going to get in the way.I prefer to post process in Lightroom with Leica's RAW format. It seems the codec was devised with Lightroom in mind. I get much better results than with other image processing software.If you paid attention in art class, can compose an image properly, and understand how and why to adjust everything on this camera (there isn't really much) then you can turn out images suitable for publication, even magazine covers, with the X1. I use my string tripod a lot, just to try to increase my number of keeper shots. It's good for several stops of slowing down the shot if you use it right. Not bad for a piece of parachute cord. And it fits with the mission of this camera: minimalist.This camera fits me right to the core. I've always been about simple equipment allowing me to focus all my attention on the artistic fundamentals of good photography. Some may complain about the slow handling of this camera.

According to reviews I'd read over the past few months, that is.  What I got in my hands was akin to an expensive watch or a fine piece of jewelry, and very solid - not a \"lightweight\" item by any means.I was also prepared for a so-so body color, since many reviewers said they wished there were an all-black model, like the M9.  No disappointment here either - the dark grey trim works perfectly with the black grain finish of the body.  I wouldn't want all black after seeing this up close - plain black is too common, and the X1 is elegantly beautiful.If you're a fan of expensive goodies - Rolex watches, Porsche autos, etc. - then you would likely know instantly when handling the X1 why it costs so much.  If you're not intimately familiar with those types of goods, then you might not appreciate this camera at this price level.  I would even go so far as to say that you don't pay $2,000.00 for a compact camera based on its performance specs, other than final image quality perhaps.  I don't recall any other reviewers saying that, although some hinted at it, allowing a certain amount of \"forgiveness\" to Leica for slow performance, given that this is such a specialized camera with expected low sales volume.  My advice: If you're inclined to agonize over the limitations of the X1, you'll probably be happier with a Panasonic GF1 or Olympus Pen.Image quality with the X1 is just as described by other reviewers - typical of an APS-C sensor I suppose, with much lower noise than the cameras the X1 is usually compared to - the Panasonic G1 series or Olympus Pen series.  I sometimes miss the lack of zoom with the X1, which has led me to two compensations: One, I carry a small Canon pocket camera with a ~400 mm zoom for those necessities, and two, I concentrate on using the X1 as designed - i.e. get closer to the target if it makes more sense to do so.  I've used a Panasonic G1 for a year now, and it's just too bulky for my tastes.  The Panasonic GF1 with pancake lens would be a reasonable substitute for a Leica X1, but my feeling is that very few people would buy a GF1 and use only the small lens.Many reviewers have complained about the top-panel dials either being loose, or easily bumped and changed.  While those dials are not loose (they're quite firm when I turn them), they are in fact easily bumped and changed, which can be a serious problem when out shooting.  I shot 30 photos a few days ago that were all taken at f2.8, when I thought the dial was set to Auto.  And it was set to Auto, and accidentally bumped.  This is a camera you will have to pay attention to, controls-wise.  I also use the 18709 form-fitting case, which often pops the lens cap off when opened.  That's another thing you have to be careful with.  I will say that the overall design with the top dials, and the controls on the back and how all of that works with the menus, is superbly done.  There are two things I wish for - one, exposure lock separate from focus lock, and two, retraction of the lens with selectable timing, when the camera goes on playback.Most reviewers have commented on the battery life, and many not favorably.  My experience is that the X1 runs longer on a battery than most compact cameras, but of course, not nearly as long as most DSLR's.  For the typically intended use of the X1, for casual walkabouts, carrying one extra battery should be all anyone needs for hours of shooting.  And going out without an extra battery is not recommended for any camera under any conditions I can imagine.There have been many complaints about the X1's screen resolution, but I've found it to be adequate for most purposes.  One exception is when I was shooting a scene after sunset when the light was getting very dim, and I had trouble focusing, even with the extra magnification in manual focus mode.  In that case I resorted to guessing the distance and using the camera's distance indicator, which worked OK.  I haven't had a problem shooting in sunlight that I can blame on the screen-as-viewfinder design, since with my Panasonic G1 and its actual viewfinder, I've had the same problem, which required shielding on the left or right to block the sun from the eye that wasn't peering through the viewfinder.  A high-resolution screen for playback is questionable as well, since (from what I've heard) most digicams don't zoom in on the full resolution of the JPEG (assuming there is a JPEG), but on a smaller copy, like a thumbnail.As a final comment, I did some experiments with the so-called Image Stabilization.  Taking a dozen shots with IS off, and another dozen with IS on, in low light handheld at 1/30 second, I was able to get all 12 reasonable sharp when on, but only about 7 when off.  I repeated the experiment under different conditions with different lighting, but dim enough that the shutter speed was always 1/30 second, and got similar results each time.  But here's the twist: When I examined the 12 images taken with IS on, and the 7 sharpest images taken with IS off, the IS-off images were very slightly more detailed, in a peculiar way - it seemed as though the IS-on images taken by the camera were slightly shifted from one another (makes sense, yes?), and when the camera combined those images, it smeared the fine detail slightly, although it gave an overall better percentage of acceptably sharp images, based on my perception of acceptably sharp.So would I recommend this camera?  For those few people who appreciate the finer (and more expensive) things in life, where a significant percentage of the price is in the build and appearance qualities of the item (qualities that can't be described here), yes.  And even those people should be aware of what they're getting, since the X1 will require a lot of attention in use, unlike a common digicam on automatic.  Everyone else should be cautious - I've read a lot about the X1 and how potential buyers are agonizing over the features compared to (mostly) the Panasonic or Olympus Micro 4/3 cameras.  While there's nothing wrong with that kind of analysis, the designs are so different, and the price-for-features ratio so far apart, that I see problems making a purchase decision on those comparisons.  If any of this sounds negative, it shouldn't be.  If you want a real Leica camera, but have doubts about the performance or features of the X1, there's always the M9 or S2.Review Part 2:The Leica X1 is nominally a compact camera, but it's actually about midway in size and weight between the typical pocket camera and a Micro 4/3 camera such as the Panasonic GF1 with pancake lens. Many comments have been made about the \"Leica quality\" body and lens. The body is certainly Leica in style, build, and aesthetics, but the term quality in this case is directed toward attributes that are peculiar to handmade cameras such as the X1, M9, and so on. Many of the machine-made cameras such as the Panasonic LX3 have equal build quality, but are obviously machine made. The lens of the X1 is up to Leica standards, which means that it's generally sharper edge-to-edge than the typical lenses sold with low-to-medium priced cameras, particularly at the widest apertures such as f2.8 (maximum for the X1).The X1 has a simplified design with aperture and shutter speed dials on top, and those dials each have an 'A' setting for auto-exposure. Since the X1 has a large (APS-C) sensor in a small body with a small battery, there isn't enough power to make the camera as fast and responsive as a typical DSLR or even some of the faster compact cameras. Because of this, and due to the fact that those dials are easily disturbed when removing the camera from a bag or a large pocket, the X1 becomes in effect a manually-controlled camera with a modest level of automatic function.Much has been said about the image quality of the X1, and that quality is on a par with other cameras having APS-C sized sensors. Due to the Leica lens used in the X1, and given the Leica processing engine in the camera's internal firmware, the resulting images captured by the camera will have a unique look that many afictionados describe as the \"Leica look\". While the X1's images will probably not in most cases be better than those produced by cameras of equivalent price (about $2000 U.S.), they will be better than images produced by most cameras of equivalent size.Since the X1 has such a large sensor in a relatively small body, the focal length is necessarily limited to maintain the small overall size. Where most of today's compact digital cameras have zoom lenses, with some of those reaching a 35 mm equivalence of 300 to 400 mm, the X1 has a single fixed focal length of 36 mm (in 35 mm equivalence). Noting the previous paragraphs here describing the manually-controlled aspect of the X1, this fixed focal length requires even greater manual effort to get the correct framing for each situation, since you can't just zoom in or out. In other words, you will have to zoom with your feet, moving closer to or further away from the subject as needed.The X1 uses a unique form of image stabilization ('IS'), where the camera takes two images for each one that you snap, and combines the two images into a single final image. This 'IS' can improve your success ratio in some cases, so that if you're getting less than 50 percent sharp photos when shooting handheld at low shutter speeds with 'IS' off, you may get 75 to 90 percent sharp photos with the 'IS' set to on. But there is a catch - the very sharpest images you capture with 'IS' off will probably be very slightly sharper than most of the images you get with 'IS' set to on. That's because of the unavoidable small movement of the camera between the two images captured by the 'IS' process. And even then, you would not likely be able to tell any difference unless viewing the photos at 100 percent enlargement on a large computer screen.Many reviewers have commented negatively on the X1's battery life, but it's actually on a par with other compact cameras. DSLR batteries are generally much larger than the X1's battery, and thus have a much longer life in use. Some reviews have found fault with the X1's screen, which has less resolution than most compact cameras costing a fraction of the X1's price. In actual use, however, the screen is more than adequate for composing, focusing, and reviewing images after the fact. If a competing camera were able to zoom in on the full-size image it has saved on its memory card, instead of zooming in on a thumbnail of the image, then it would have a clear advantage over the X1 when reviewing its images.Conclusion: If you want a simplified camera that requires manual settings, or that tends to enforce the same due to the considerations noted above, then there are two other factors that you would probably consider most relevant to justify the $2000 price of the X1: 1) The handmade Leica quality that's obvious when you hold this camera for the first time, and 2) The image quality that is approached closely only by much larger cameras that have APS-C or larger sensors.", "Date": "April 9, 2010"}, {"Title": "Great", "Author": "M.
