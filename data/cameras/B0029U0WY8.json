{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Great Camera for old Minolta users!", "Author": "Kenneth L. Sockwell", "ReviewID": "R3EHBC2N8RQ7GE", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I've been using this camera for several weeks now and I am very impressed. Here are the pros, in my opinion:(1) The camera is very light and balanced when using the 18-55 lens. My wife was very surprised at the weight, or lack of it.(2) Minolta Maxxum autofocus lenses work flawlessly with this camera! I have two old telephotos (20 years old) that produce incredible pictures with the new Sony. My old zoom flash works too, although I have to adjust exposure manually. Although the newer Sony lenses are much lighter, quality older lenses can be purchased on auction sites for a fraction of the cost of new lenses. Just remember: they will be much heavier than today's modern opticals.(3) The A330 functions well as an automatic point and shoot camera, but also allows the flexibility to set everything manually if desired. I especially appreciate the ease of setting white balance for those flashless shots in changing lighting conditions. Depth of field was easy to adjust using Aperture priority.(4) Picture quality is outstanding. Viewing the high definition output on my Sony Bravia through the HDMI output is an incredible way to preview photos. My TV remote even advances the photos in my camera as I watch!(5) It will take both an SD memory card and a Memory Stick Pro Duo card AT THE SAME TIME. When one is full, the flip of a switch changes to the other card. Memory is mostly limited by the size of your wallet.(6) The 3200 iso setting does well in low light situations, although there is some grain.Here are a few cons:(1) Some functions are buried in menus. This seems to be par for the course these days for all camera manufacturers.(2) In moving up from an 8 mega-pixel camera, this 10.2 creates substantially larger files. It is important to take into consideration what the photos will be used for, and then set the resolution accordingly.(3) The pop up flash knocks my hat off!I did a lot of research before purchasing this camera. The primary selling point was the ability to use my old Minolta lenses, and the tilting rear screen. This camera reminds me of my old 35mm. It feels like I am really taking pictures again, instead of merely capturing digital images. Those wanting or needed more features should look at the higher end Sonys. However, for beginner or intermediate photographers, this should fit the bill just fine!", "Date": "January 6, 2010"}, {"Title": "Spent Days Comparing...After over 1000 Shots, Very Very Pleased!", "Author": "GJ Barnes", "ReviewID": "R16OYFFGCHGKZ6", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Ok, I have literally spent days painstakingly comparing entry-level DSLRs (Canon XS, XSi; Nikon d3000, d5000; Pentax k-x) and have even made my own excel spread sheet grading each of the technical pros and cons. Obviously, I finally chose the a330, so I will write this review from the perspective of the reason why i chose this camera and why I've immensely enjoyed it.Picture Quality- Since you are looking for an entry level DSLR, the picture quality for all entry levels is comparable (in my opinion). Since I am a manual mode shooter, the quality of my shots are really based on settings (aperture, shutter speed, ISO, light, etc) so you'll be able to get good quality out of all of them.-I would rate the a330 as a bit more exceptional, because in the manual mode, Sony has something called \"Creative Style\" where you can further tweak your shot (vivid color, night shot, sunset etc....and for each one of those modes, you can further alter saturation, sharpness and contrast). See some of my pictures in my profile!Lenses-This was one of the first reasons why the Sony alpha series made my short list - any Sony or Minolta lens will work with this camera. In addition, because the image stabilization is built into the camera and not the lens, the cost is more reasonable compared to other lenses. Therefore, any lens I find on eBay I can use (don't have to worry if a particular Sony lens or older Minolta lens will work, so my options are endless).Speed-  Although the continuously shooting isn't the fastest in its class, it's definitely usable. When I first was looking at FPS, I thought this was something that was high on my feature list, but turns out (unless you are a sporting-event photographer)  when you shot something relativity still, you end up with tons of pictures, where you'll end up just deleting most of them. So the 2.5-3 fps is still faster then i will need.-  As noted by other reviewers, the AF is blazing fast (with 9 AF points), and the switching between Live View and the optical view finder is very fast as well!Battery- The battery power is pretty decent, especially since I don't shot with the flash. But here's my work-around: I just use a vertical battery grip, that add three batteries total to use seamlessly ([...]). This grip makes your camera look like the big 2k-5k cameras, and give you 3Xs the battery power.A230 vs A330-  As those who have researched this well, the a230 is exactly the same camera as the a330, but it doesn't have the live view and tilting LCD. I thought, I'm definitely getting the a230, because the viewfinder is better, and the price is way cheaper. But I found that I love shooting with the Live view, because in manual mode, the live view gives me an estimate of how aperture, focus, shutter speed and iso would effect my shot vs with the viewfinder in the a230, where it doesn't show me any of that(in the viewfinder-only case, I'm stuck waiting unto the preview shows, so I would have to check every shot and then adjust, etc). So the Live view saves me time and space on my SC card and I get pictures right the first or second time, versus the 4th or 5th time!I could write all about my experience with the Nikon a3000 and a5000, and Canon XS and XSi but I'll just say after testing all of them I like the Sony betterp.s. I realize Nikon and Canon are more prevalent in the market of DSLRs, which is why I wanted to give Sony a real chance - FYI I have a Canon HD video camera, which I love WAY better than any of the Sony models, so for video, I would definitely go with a Canon.", "Date": "March 27, 2010"}, {"Title": "Advice on moving up from point and shoot:", "Author": "Katie Kate \"Kate\"", "ReviewID": "R2KV298GOSD6KI", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I am by no means a professional photographer. I was sick of my point and shoot taking so long to start & the delay between each picture. It's ridiculous & plain doesn't work with my toddlers. I also was sick of paying photographers hundreds of dollars a couple of times a year to do photographs of my kids. This will save me a bundle, two trips to the photographer & it's paid for. Google how to do professional portraits at home, you'll be amazed at what you find. The accessories you'd need/want are so inexpensive. A light disc can be had for under $20, for example.Having said that, if you are looking to move up to an SLR from a P&S; model, this is a great option. It received stellar ratings from Consumer Reports, earning their best buy logo. I have never used an SLR and read lots before purchasing this camera. I took it out of the box and as soon as the battery was charged, I was shooting away. The camera comes with an ultra simple quick-start guide & a full owner's manual. This is helpful when you can't wait to start shooting.When purchasing this camera for photographing kids/sports, spend the extra $20-30 and get the pro-stick duo memory card made by Sony. I am always skeptical of the need to purchase name brand, but the additional speed the Sony card gives this camera is exceptional. I had a generic memory card from my point and shoot. It works in the camera, but slows down shots, especially in sports mode. Since this is very important to me, it is well worth it. If you were going to say, take pictures of landscapes and flowers, maybe not so much.In hand the camera feels sturdy and comfortable. However, there isn't a great place to hold on with your left hand. I think they sell grips for this purpose, but it isn't a deal breaker, so I'll just let it go for now and see if I get used to it. In the regard of hanging on with just a couple fingers from your left hand, it's much the same as you would do with a little point and shoot.Let's be honest 10.2 megapixels is plenty! How big do we really need to print our pictures? The price difference between this and 12 just doesn't make it worth the extra definition.PROS:Price (especially on amazon)Quick shootingQuick start upEasy to useProfessional looking resultsInternal stabilizationCrisp imagesPlenty of functions/featuresWell built construction, solid feelingCONS:Ergonomics for left hand isn't greatFunctions best on relatively expensive memory stickIn conclusion, I will keep my cheapy point and shoot in my purse for emergencies.

It's a fantastic camera for those wanting something a little better than a point and shoot. I have tiny hands, so the ergonomics were perfect for me. However, even though I bought mine brand new, after around 7000 shots I discovered a few problems started to pop up.*The sensitivity of the sensor started to play up in manual and auto modes, leaving my photos under exposed when in fact the reading on the meter said the light was balanced.*The shutter started to jam at 1/100.*Noise started to become more prominent at 400ISO rather than just at 3200, even in medium light conditions.My old minolta mount 70-300mm teles work a charm on this camera and the 18-55mm kit lens is pretty decent.  I have also dragged this camera around as a backup to my old A750 for weddings and it has taken some fantastic results, but not so good results in low light conditions eg, live events etc. Despite buying a couple of Canon 60Ds and a 5D Mk2 since then, I still wholeheartedly recommend this camera for entry level photographers... I have since had the problems fixed and have given this camera to my 9 year old niece who's a budding photographer and she absolutely loves it. It's durable, light and easy to use. Most importantly, it's a great way for entry level photographers to learn the basics of manual functions as it tells you what to do on the LCD.Apart from the problems at high shutter counts, it's an awesome camera.", "Date": "October 13, 2010"}, {"Title": "Awesome entry level dSLR", "Author": "Amazon Customer", "ReviewID": "RJYL1JCPOQ16U", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This is a fantastic product for an entry level dSLR user.  It may be a great camera for an intermediate or advanced user too, but as I have little experience with photography, I really can't speak to the more advanced demographic.  To research my purchase I spent time in two different brick-and-mortar camera shops.  When I explained that I use a point and shhot digital and that I had experience 15 years ago with a 35mm film SLR, both shops instantly directed me to the Sony Alpha line (and to the A330 in specific when I disclosed my price range).  They said that for the price, its the best quality camera in town and the only camera in the range with a tilting LCD for live view (They also mentioned that SOny makes most of the sensors used in Nikon and Canon dSLRs) which has already come in handy.  The menus and display options are what really sold me.  The menu interface when shooting on aperature and speed priority mode are very straight forward and the location of the scroll wheel is perfect for making changes without moving yout eye from the viewfinder.  Changing the aperature, shutter speed, white balance, ISO, auto-focus area and all other in-the-moment settings are very easy and therefore fast.  If you remember to look and pay attention the two different LCD displays make your shot all but dumie proof (which helps me a lot) and in live view you can get a histogram and a few more options to help optomize your shot.  The body feels very solid in my hand and, despite being an entry level lens, I have captuered some great wild life and macro shots in the month that I have owned the camera.  I have cropped some shots up to 60% and, on a 4x6 print, you would never know it was blown up.Over all I am excited about my purchase and the quality that Sony is putting into A330.", "Date": "October 1, 2010"}, {"Title": "Awesome Camera!!", "Author": "Rebecca I. Haukaas", "ReviewID": "R16CU5WKVLR4Z8", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Love love love this camera!! We did our research before purchasing and are really happy with the pictures that we have taken.Pros:- Quickest AF on live view that you can find. We have 2 young boys and needed to be able to catch them on the fly without blur. Trying out the other similar cameras out there we found there was no comparison to the speed that the Sony has on live view.- Size & style are perfect. We actually went with the bronze color for something different and have gotten lots of comments on it.- Great picture quality and options- Space for two memory cards at the same timeCons:- Screen doesn't flip around to protect it- My husband blinks in every single picture with the normal flash. No one else does this that I have tried it on except for him. We had to purchase a bounce flash to take a normal family picture.Because of the blinking problem we went back to the store to try out other brands (he blinks with every single Sony camera). The only one that came close in our mind was the Nikon 5000. Even then, I don't want to give up my Sony because it is SOOOOOOOO much quicker I know that I will just get annoyed with the speed of a Nikon. Even my blinking hubby doesn't want to give it up and purchased the new flash. :)", "Date": "January 28, 2010"}, {"Title": "Beginner DSLR user", "Author": "T.

It met one of my key requirements: it had to use my (pretty old) Minolta lenses, and they both fit and work perfectly.  I was surprised, however, that I have to choose between the regular viewfinder and the video screen.  I thought that even if I was looking through the viewfinder, the image would still appear on the screen.  This hasn't affected my use of the camera, and my pictures are beautifully clear and sharp regardless of how I view them.

I followed the recommendations of other reviewers and purchased a Minolta zoom lens for under $100 and it works perfectly.  I like the fact that it uses two types of media to record on and I really like the fact that I wasn't paying for a camera that had a movie mode - I already have a great Sony movie camera and have never yet used my still cameras for movies.

I wanted to get some use in before reviewing it.  Like others, I spent a great deal of time doing online research of many cameras before making a purchase decision.I was using a Kodak z740 P&S; which had become problematic for me in that it took forever to \"process\" a shot before letting me take another one.  And I was getting better and learning more and wanted to delve into more manual settings.I chose the Sony a330 for a few reasons.  The tilting screen is what got me.  I take a lot of outdoor closeup shots, and often can be found on the ground on my knees or belly.  I knew that the ability to tilt the screen toward me would be a great help, and it has been.  It also comes in handy when standing in a crowd around a stage.  I can lift the camera up above my head and still see what I'm shooting!  Wonderful!I recommend getting a screen protector right away, since it does not rotate to protect itself.  I did and have not had any problems with it.I also like that if I so desire, I can find and use the cheaper Minolta lenses on eBay or elsewhere and still have image stabilization!I like the live view on the Sony.  The way they engineered it is pretty cool and unique in the industry, which makes it the best.  Also, if you want to learn how changing settings like aperture, ISO, speed and others will affect your shot, you can see it happen as you adjust them on this live view!  Pretty helpful for someone wanting to learn to use manual settings.The ability to use two different types of storage cards is a plus. I tried using my old SD card, a 512mb, but it was slow.  So definitely go for a newer SDHC card for additional speed.  I could probably even do better than this, but its cost prohibitive right now.It is a bigger camera, and it took me a while to get used to that, coming from a much smaller camera.  That's the only reason for the 3 stars on portability.  I had read a lot about the grip on the Sony too.  Lots of people/reviewers think it is too small.  And I did notice that at first and thought they may have something there.  But in no time at all, my hand got used to it and its fine now.  You just have to give yourself time to adjust to something different.Battery.  Simply get one or two extra.  Anyone who uses their camera a lot knows to do this.  Using live view sucks more battery life than using the viewfinder.  But I usually switch to live view only when its most useful.  I have been able to take 200+ shots on one battery in a day.  And that's with several on and off cycles too.  When you charge them, leave it on the charger for an hour or two beyond when the light goes off.  It's in the manual.  This gives you a more fully charged battery.I just really love my new Sony!  I do not regret going with this brand at all.  If I ever decide to upgrade, it will probably be a bigger Sony model.  My husband got a Nikon D5000 around the same time as I got this camera, and he said the menu system was better on the Sony.If you decide to get it and really like taking photos, there are two groups on Flickr just for this brand and camera with useful info in the discussions.", "Date": "September 16, 2010"}, {"Title": "100% pleased", "Author": "Stephen K.

I am not a professional photographer by any means, or even a talented amateur. Really, I was replacing a older Sony Cybershot p&s; and all I really wanted was a camera that would be fast and responsive for normal family photos. Maybe I was wrong to expect the DSLR to replace my point and shoot with no bumps in the road, but that is the expectation that I went into this purchase with. I'll also preface this being saying that perhaps my lack of experience is partially to blame for my complaints/issues/problems/concerns, but I don't think it's unrealistic to expect a $400 DSLR on auto to perform *at least* as well as any P&S; would in the past 5 years costing significantly less. Alright, on to the obligatory Pros & Cons:Pros:* Startup time: Very fast. This is one of the items I wanted and cannot complain. Its ready almost immediately.* Battery life: Very good. About what should be expected for a Lithium of its size. no complaints there either.* Dual card slots: not that anyone would choose a memory stick over SD if they can avoid it, buts its nice to have both, especially if you already have some MS lying around (like me, from our older Cybershot and a Sony camcorder.)* Photo quality: Seems excellent when I can get the photos to come out clear (see below.) I am not printing posters or photographing for magazine publication so my expectations (and needs) were low anyways so take this with a grain of salt.* Zoom: I know this certainly isn't specific to this camera, but I enjoy the manual zoom rather than \"pushbutton\" zoom you get on every P&S.;* Anti-shake: Seems to work well - I have very unsteady hands and it always seems to come out clear anyways, except for the subject movement because...Cons:* Low light sensitivity: This is probably my biggest problem. I had seen other people complain about \"low light\" issues, but coming from a basic P&S; I didn't realize that \"low light\" basically meant \"indoors under any lighting conditions.\"My living room (combo living room and kitchen open area) is about 400 sqft and has a total of 22 ceiling lights. Even with every light on, without the flash on the camera always wants to slow down the shutter speed to multiple second lengths. The anti-shake works excellent but my dogs/wife/child don't like to sit perfectly still for several seconds while unwrapping christmas gifts so this often results in nice sharp backgrounds with a big blur in the middle. If I put the camera into manual (which my wife would most definitely not put up with) I can get keep it at a normal speed but the exposure is too dark to be usable (which I do realize the very-smart camera had already figured out.) Ok, so why don't I just use the flash? On to...* Flash: the flash is nice and powerful. Way too powerful to be used indoors for any photo I have been able to take. It is so harsh that much of the photo gets washed out in white. I have since purchased the Sony version of the Gary Fong Puffer and this has helped quite a bit but it leaves a bad taste in my mouth that I need a $20 piece of enormous white plastic clipped onto my camera to take a photo indoors.* Autofocus speed: While its decent and acceptable, its not really much faster at autofocusing (again, indoors under \"low light\") than my 5 year old Cybershot was. Same for the cycle time on flash - faster, but not by much. I will say that cycle time without the flash is blazing fast though, much faster than the P&S; could dream for.So, in summary, it is a decent camera, but seems to require to many work-arounds. I simply wanted a fast P&S; replacement, but it doesn't seem like that is going to happen.[UPDATE:] having used the camera for a couple of years now, I feel I might have been a bit harsh in my original review and have decided to up it to 4 stars. Some of my whining was simply from inexperience with it.Outdoors in full daylight autofocus is near instantaneous. Indoors is fast, faster than I gave it credit for really, but still could be better.Battery life is mediocre but within range of what Sony claims. The live-view really sucks the battery, but they tell you that up front. A second battery is a must.I do need to comment that the current price of $600 (as of 8/2012) is absurd. My purchase price of $400 at the time (late 2010) was reasonable.Performance is much better with the viewfinder than with the live view. I still use the live view most of the time because I'm not a photographer and hate the viewfinder thing, but for action shots the viewfinder is a must. The difference is night and day. The auto-review seems to introduce a lag before it'll let you go back to record mode.\"Auto\" still is too slow for animals and kids, but running in Shutter-priority easily fixes that. After forcing the shutter speed I want, the camera does a decent job of setting everything else. Aperature priority works well too, though the kit lens is too slow to make any use of it. Ironically, I find this much easier to work with than the myriad \"Scene\" modes so popular. Maybe I'd like them more if I was taking pictures regularly of: A Mountain, A Flower, The Moon, or A Face. Oh, or a Sprinter. I saw one camera that boasted 26 scene modes. Really? That is supposed to make things easier than what amounts to about 3 items you need to set manually? But I digress.Autofocus selection is quite random and not very good at guessing at all, but using spot focus works well and it tracks well.It would be nice if the camera rotated photos when held vertically since it's sensors can obviously detect that, but oh well.Primary reason for upping the reason from 3 to 4: the availability of Minolta lenses. I see more and more DSLR and DSLR wannabees being released (including models from Sony) with proprietary lenses that all inevitably cost more than the camera itself. Thanks to the use of used A mount lenses on this camera, I was able to get a 50mm/1.7, 28-200, 28-80, and 100-300 for a combined total of $175. If I had purchased an E mount NEX model, one 55-200 would have cost me $250 new, and that is one of the more reasonable ones.", "Date": "February 26, 2011"}, {"Title": "Great camera.", "Author": "Ram G \"Ram G\"", "ReviewID": "REX5VH7GX3NW8", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Very good camera.

This little gem is a joy to use and it was not until recently that I realized the ture potiential of the camera by getting the Tamron 17-50 2.8 SP/XR lens for it.  Pictures looked good before, but now they look great!  Insead of more mega pixels and a larger sensor, try a really good lens.  You'll be suprised how good a picture this little camera can take with a the fast Tamron zoom.  It's like night and day when compaired to the kit lens.  I'm keeping my A330 until I die.  I may very well get a full sized sensor model with maybe 20 to 30 gb's or so, but only because I may want to print a poster sized print one day.  Until then, I very very content with what I've got.  BTW, only paid $450.00 for the A330L on Amazon with Prime shipping.  For me, a great camera and highly recommended.  Get one on sale without a lens if possible, and pick up the Tamron 17-50 to start off.  You'll be glad you did.", "Date": "November 13, 2010"}, {"Title": "WOW - This DSLR is amazing!!", "Author": "Michael J.

A friend of mine, who is a professional newspaper photographer, has been trying to get me to go with a DSLR for a while.  Knowing that I'm a Minolta person, told me to check out the Sony series of cameras, as they will accept the Maxxum lenses.  After talking with several local camera shops about the Sony (one actually let me try one for the weekend) I bought the A330.  This camera has made the transition from 35mm extremely easy.  While I haven't yet used all the functions incorporated into the camera, I find the simularities between the A330 and the Maxxum very close.  The following are some of the pros and cons I have found with the A330.Pros:1.  Solid camera body construction without the excess weight.2.  10.2 megapixel gives extremely good print quality and will allow prints to be enlarged to a moderate size without loss of clarity.3.  Adjustable ISO give very good results even at 3200.  At ISO 800 picture quality is a little more grainy than at higher or lower ISO speeds.4.  Autofocus is blazing fast.5.  Live view gives a very accurate sight picture.  Screen size is very good.6.  Auto stabilization is first rate.  Having auto stabilzation built into the camera instead of the lens is great.  My Maxxum lenses benefit greatly from auto stabilzation.7.  A very comprehensive manual comes with the camera.Cons:1.  Battery life is very good, but not outstanding.  An extra battery pack is necessary if you shoot alot or use the flash alot.  A minor inconvenience at best.2.  If you like to shoot sports, the Frames Per Second may be a little slower than what you like.  For most situations, FPS is acceptable.3.  Pop up flash has some force behind it.  If you wear a baseball cap or hat with a brim, expect to get bumped by it.4.  Live view screen only tilts.  Other adjustments would be beneficial.With the exception of a couple of minor glitches, the Sony A330 is the perfect camera for those switching from 35mm to digital.  While I won't completely give up 35mm, I believe that my A330 will now be my workhorse camera.Having owned the A330 for 8 months now, I think that Sony's tagline should be \"Even Old Dinosaurs Can Learn New Tricks!\"", "Date": "November 5, 2010"}, {"Title": "all in one bundle", "Author": "barry", "ReviewID": "R8D4QI11YGARY", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "The main problem with this product is that, its digital screen is not visible in low light conditions.

I've had quite a few point-and-shoot cameras and they've always been very \"meh\" to me.  So when I lost my Canon camera I decided I wasn't going to waste money and I decided to just get a decent DSLR camera that could take somewhat professional looking shots.I've had this camera for about three months now, and I always load my best shots onto my Facebook page after a party, event, concert, etc.  My friends are always complimenting my shots and how good they look!  I'm not even really trying that hard and I'm still learning how to use all of its features, though I am becoming increasing interested in photography due to the compliments I've gotten.

I will just mention my feelings of this camera.First of all, the ergonomics. I was a little nervous about the hand grip because of all the bad comments it had received. When I was finally able to hold it for longer period of time, i found that there are subtle grooves on the hand grip that help the fingers. The hand grip could be a little bigger, but no complaints.i love the camera as a whole, except for the placement of some of the buttons, namely the Menu, AV and the button next to the Live-view switch.The optical viewfinder is a little small, but is fine. It is also noticeable that the optical viewfinder doesn't give 100% coverage, but one just has to get used to it and frame accordingly.Love the camera, just remember to try the camera out before you buy it.", "Date": "July 25, 2010"}, {"Title": "love the camera...when it works", "Author": "Sadie Roo \"Sadie\"", "ReviewID": "R13O49FXBO5VVO", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I absolutely love everything about the camera, when it is working. Not even a year old and something was knocked loose. It was taking crooked pictures and had to be sent in. Not even 2 years old now and the light bulb in the factory flash piece went out. Now I can only take pictures in the direct sunlight. My gripe is that SONY won't sell me the light bulb. I need to send it in for $108.00 or take it to any of the local repair shops and pay 20 for the piece and $220 for the labor. Mind as well buy a new camera.
