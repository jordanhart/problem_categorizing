{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Pretty good little camera for the money", "Author": "oldsalt19", "ReviewID": "RJGMD4GPNH38N", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "It seems that the RX18 and the RZ18 are identical cameras. The user's manual has both designations on the cover. Mine is labeled rx18. Different suppliers at Amazon are liquidating their inventories so there is some spread in prices. I've seen prices up to $153. I got lucky and scored pretty much the last camera from a specific Amazon-connected store for $94+S&H.;A lot of the camera details are not surprising for an inexpensive camera. Right out of the box I got the immediate impression of CHEAP, CHEAP, CHEAP. While many cameras have a lot of plastic in them, most are pretty good at making the finish look and feel like metal. With the RX18, the manufacturer brooks no such dishonesty. The shell looks and feels like thin gauge plastic. There is no exposure or focusing bracketing. There is no RAW mode. The video mode is limited to HD 1280X720 instead of a full 1920X1080. The lens cannot zoom during filming. One has to stop the filming, change the zoom, and then resume taping. None of this is surprising for a cheap camera. What does impress me is the huge 18X zoom range--the 35mm equivalent of 25mm wide angle to a powerful 450mm telephoto. I checked images at both ends of the zoom range as well as near the middle and was impressed with the overall sharpness. Autofocus is reasonably fast and very accurate. Noise is acceptable at the base ISO of 80 but deteriorates rapidly at even modestly higher ISO settings. The RX-18 produces a largish 16 MP image file. With the small sensor in the RX-18 (and every other superzoom,) the image starts to falter at about 12 MP. When examined at 100%, as may be expected, the 16 MP images produced by the RX-18 looked like, well, 12 MP images that had been blown up to 16MP. It doesn't degrade the final picture, but it's just useless resolution.  The worst part is that it may mislead the consumer.  This is not an Amazon problem.  It's Pentax PR and most camera companies do it.Then I discovered the sound recorder. A number of cameras offer this feature but it is usually not this easily accessible.  Now I can make voice notes at a touch by coupling this feature with a provided \"green\" programmable button. The sound is very tinny and of low quality when played back through the camera but when the resulting WAV file is run on the computer, the sound is actually very good.Then I discovered a feature that really brightened my day. The flower icon on the four-way controller brings up a menu that offers not only a macro mode but \"Super\" macro mode--and super it is. I do a lot of science photography and it involves a great deal of close-up work. In my test, this camera at widest zoom focuses to less than an inch. A 49mm lens cap is just sufficient to fill the field of view at closest focus.The camera, at least my sample, is manufactured in Indonesia.", "Date": "March 14, 2013"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": "Unavailable", "Features": null, "Name": "Pentax Optio RX18 Digital Camera Dark Silver", "ImgURL": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/515rLMque3L._SX300_.jpg", "ProductID": "B007FEJSS4"}}
