I think it is easy to use, andHP packages it with useful software and cable connections. For (this price) you can't find to many cameras that come with 8MB of storage. Its' red eye reduction, auto focus, and zoom functions really help to create some terrific photos. Also HP has provided me with great customer support. They send emails with creative ideas, and have a website for support also.", "Date": "December 11, 2000"}, {"Title": "I love this camera!", "Author": "beansb", "ReviewID": "R20XA6P5Q8UT49", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I recieved this camera 2 years ago as a Christmas gift. Both the camera and the software are exceptionally easy to use. I've even used the software to edit scanned photos.The quality of the pictures is \"okay\" on low-resolution but wonderful on highest resolution. I suggest buying a larger flash memory card so you can keep the setting on high resolution and still take loads of pictures.After having this camera dropped causing a misalignment that rendered the download cable unusable, and finding that a repair would cost more than the camera [...] I purchased a Sandisk Flash Memory Card Reader [...] and I wouldn't live without one. Just wish I'd known sooner because the flash memory card reader has saved me a ton of money on batteries. I no longer have to keep the camera on to download the photos and it virtually eliminates downloading time. I will be buying flash memory card readers for several people on my christmas list!", "Date": "December 4, 2001"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": "Unavailable", "Features": "1-megapixel CCD sensor creates 1,152 x 872 images for prints up to 4 by 6 inches\n2x digital zoom lens with autofocus\nIncluded 8 MB CompactFlash memory card holds 17 images at default resolution\nConnects to PCs and Macs via serial port\n4 AA batteries included; features slide-show mode and red-eye reduction", "Name": "Hewlett-Packard PhotoSmart C200 1.0 MP Digital Camera", "ImgURL": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/612A8NQTTWL._SX300_.gif", "ProductID": "B0000509JH"}}
