Both are Model 7701V and my local installer got the Viper to accept the programming.  So make sure that the back of your remote has Model 7701V stamped on it.Note:  If you have two remotes and if the remote that you are not using is in range, it takes about 20 seconds for it to receive the lock/unlock status from the car.Update April 9, 2011.
