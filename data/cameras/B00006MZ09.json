It is the best for taking those \"spontaneous\" shots - I bring it with me wherever i go, and it won't cramp your style either (ever try and go to a party hauling a big clunky camera around..?)battery life- uses a proprietary (lithium ion?) battery - the charge seems to last forever.  I've taken dozens and dozens of pictures with this camera (using flash + LCD on) and still never had the battery run out of juice.  menu/features- the menu system is fantastic, yet intuitive, and gives you a wide range of control over things like white balance, etc. the camera recharges *amazingly* quickly after using the flash, and is capable of taking shots in quick succession with almost no lag time.  The screen is amazing (plus you can zoom in on the picture you're displaying!), and doesn't chew up batteries either.  Plus you can take excellent quality video clips (up to 30 seconds).The not-quite as good:resolution: this camera is listed on amazon as being 2MP, but my model clearly says 1.82 MP.  This is evident if you look at the pictures as well (even on the highest quality setting).  Furthermore the 1600x1200 mode *is* interpolated, contrary to what the reviewer below said.  I generally take picures in 1280x1024 and then reduce them in photoshop to 800x600, which produces quite nice results.  but the end, the pictures it produces can't compare to higher resolution digital cams.digital zoom: like all digital zooms, it bites. well, you can't have it all at this size, and i generally don't find myself missing an optical zoom anyway.software: not the best (nor so bad as to be unuseable) but (under win XP), you can do away with the software completely and just manipulate the camera and files direcly like any other attach USB drive. One final thing - a lot of the specs listed on amazon are completely incorrect - the camera uses SD cards (not type II CF) and certainly doesn't use 4 AAA batteries!! All in all, this is an absolutely fantastic camera which will inspire instant lust in all who gaze upon it.  I can't recommend it enough, as long as you're not looking to take ultra-high resolution professional images.

I have had other digital cameras, but the features I really like about this one are, in order of importance to me:1. FAST shutter response - due to the fixed focus lens, there is almost no delay between pressing the shutter release and getting the shot. Some cameras take so long to focus and capture that you miss the shot you were after.2. Very small and lightweight - I usually have it in my pocket or briefcase.  The slim size and flush lens keeps it from getting hung up in your pocket.3. Fast power-up and down.  Also, no waiting for a lens to extend or retract.4. Good battery life - especially long, since I mostly use the optical finder.It has a menu feature that allows you to reduce the size of a stored image for e-mailing.  This saves you from having to run it through Photoshop to reduce the size.  The stand/charger works flawlessly.  Set it in, press the \"On\" button, and the camera appears on you desktop.  Very convenient to have it connect and charge without extra cables.The SD cards hold plenty of pictures and are reasonably priced .  I recently ordered a 128-meg card for [money].Drawbacks? -The main drawback for me is that the only way to charge the battery is inside the camera, in its cradle.  It would be nice to have a way to charge the battery only, so an extra can be charging while the camera is in use.  If a separate charger doesn't come along, I might try making one.", "Date": "March 16, 2003"}, {"Title": "Debating?", "Author": null, "ReviewID": "R1JPBP932F6ZFT", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "There are some people who take one glance at the digital camera section in the electronics store and one minute later say \"that one.\" However, if you are like me, there are some people who do lots of research. They agonize over every little detail, every word in the reviews and tech specs, and a month later hold there breath and make a decision.With such a wide variety of digital cameras out there, I narrowed down on the tiny ones, only becuase the whole point of taking pictures is to capture a little moment that would be otherwise forgotten. Who wants a large clunky camera to lug in a camera bag everywhere???? The second someone says \"Where is the camera\" some people would be unclipping there carrying cases, opening up the pop-up lens, finding the right mode, waiting for it to start up, get it into focus and by then the moment is gone.But for me and all other Exilim/ tiny digital camera owners,this slick Casio powers up in seconds time and one more second to take the picture with flash. It is that simple. The design is very intuitive and the menus are extremely simple and friendly. Two modes; play or record. A shutter. A power button. A menu button and the little dial. That is it. The camera is so light you can put the strap over your hand to control it and use the other to instruct your posers. Image quality is not supreme, but the difference between this and higher resolution cameras (to me, an amateur) doesn't seem dramatically significant. Most of the my pictures will be printed no larger than 5x7 or emailed and Adobe Photoshop or Elements can change your photos to make them look so much better that (to me) to quality is good enough for me. Plus I am not going to hang my photos on the wall...maybe a little 4x6 here and there.The battery life is absolutely wonderful! Not once have I ever ran out of juice. The cradle is convienient and the little usb cover was lost on the sixth day. Flash is ok, and the manual controls are right there for you to use with ease. Best shot mode is great to get the perfect shot without tinkering with manual settings for ten minutes. Zoom, well, there is not one. Digital is so horrible it needn't be mentioned. But you can just as easily move a few feet and get the same results if not better of a camera just zooming from one location. I generally like to be farther away so I can crop (the exact same thing as zoom, just more precise and better quality) on the the computer.Overall, this camera is made of quality, looks like quality, pictures are OK quality. If you still want tiny, but want more of a resolution, I cannot recomend enough the Konica Revio model enough. However, at  [$$] more, still a good price for there type, wasn't worth it for me. Buy for your needs and tastes!  For me, this camera is perfect for my needs and taste. If you value size/ease of use/portability and looks over genral image quality and features, this camera is for you. Sorryto be so extensive.

Think about why you are buying a camara before you pay [$$] for this one.  I would think the most important thing would be picture quality, with this camara you really don't get that.  The pictures are not very good when compaired to other camaras in its price range.  Also think about how since the lens is fixed you cannot take a closeup picture of anything.  It says in the owners manual that you the closest you can get is 1M.  Think if it as you can't take a picture of text and read it as it will be too blury.  The flash is also very weak as other people are saying.  Don't get sucked in because of the \"cool\" factor of the camaras small size.  I had one for a month then bought a Canon S200 to replace it.

The fact that I could literally carry this camera in my pocket (and forget it's there) is what sold me. This is primarily a point-and-shoot camera, and as such the layout of the controls is well designed. With the camera strapped to your wrist, you can easily manipulate all the controls with your thumb and forefinger, without looking. Another thing, this camera is FAST, great for quickly--and discreetly--pulling out and taking a shot. It takes about a second to power up (it has a fixed lens, so nothing needs to zoom into position), immediately releases the shutter when you push the button without any lag time, and is ready for the next shot almost instantly. Interfacing with Mac OS X has been a breeze--nothing to install just place the camera on the base and push the power button and the camera appears on the desktop as a mounted drive and works seamlessly with iPhoto. Battery life got me through about 100+ photos with the LCD constantly on.  Speaking of the LCD, it's a handsome one. Nice and large and very sharp with good menu layout. Image quality isn't superior, but definitely acceptable for on-screen and 5x7 prints, especially for the camera size. One definite accessory you will want to buy is an SD memory card. I've found 64MB to be a good companion with the 16MB of built in memory, fitting about 120 images on the card and 25 in internal memory when shooting at 1280x960.

It does not take great photos, but for the most part, outdoor pix are not too bad.  I compared exact shots from my olympus 2 and 3 megapixel, and the colors from the casio were a little washed out- not true to color.  Indoor shots with low light are bad, as the flash is so small it does not produce very good photos.  These are the drawbacks.

The things that I love about it is that I keep it in an old billfold so I can have it with me all the time.  It powers up in about 1 second, and you are ready to take up to about 17 pictures on 1600x1200 resolution without interpolation.  If you want to take more, the camera has an expandible memory card slot.  The battery lasts for several uses, even with flash on.  The zoom feature is not really worth mentioning, and the flash works best in the 3-10 foot range.  The cradle is 1x USB.  WindowsXP automatically knows when you hook up the camera, and downloads your pictures within seconds.  Leave the camera on the cradle to charge.  Its that easy!!  The absolute best feature of this camera is the viewscreen.  Moments after you take your picture, you can view it, and even zoom in to make sure you got the image you wanted.

For once, the phrase \"fits your shirt pocket\" is true; it really does. So you've no excuse to not have your camera with you.But this isn't the only tiny camera around. It's not even the smallest. But it's the first tiny one I've seen with decent storage capacity, a two megapixel CCD, a TFT monitor, and the likelihood that it will take some decent pictures.Cameras that can manage images at 640 x 480 pixels will give you images that look okay on screen but pretty poor on paper. This Casio can manage 1600 x 1200 (and not interpolated, like some others), so you can, at a pinch, print your photos at up to A4 size without any obvious quality problems.The Exilim does have its limitations, but you can accept them because of the size and ease of use of the camera. The lens is fixed-focus (mainly means in practice that close-ups are out), there's no zoom (unless you count the digital zoom which is pointless), there's no built-in lens cover (a case costs extra), and you're going to lose the minute cover for the USB/power connector within about a week. Shame they don't give you a memory card with the camera too because you'll need more than the built in 12MB.On the other hand, the Exilim is gorgeous to look at and to hold (it inspires instant envy). It has a beautiful TFT monitor, is a doddle to use (though surprisingly sophisticated and customisable), ready to go in a flash so you don't miss those opportunities you bought it to catch, and can take pretty good photos - if you can. And little movies too. Oh, and the battery seems to last for ages.I found that it was all too ready on a cloudy day to use a very slow shutter speed, so camera-shake is a bit of an issue. The minuscule built in flash is only good for portraits really. But on the whole, the results I've had mean that as a second camera, it's absolutely fine, and the results have surprised a few people.

The joy-stick is a little too small but bearable, not too many functions (menu wise) but moderate for those who doesn't consider themselves - professionals. Then this would be fine, excellent portability, download is easy; the cradle does all the work and the program actually sited for user's (arrangement) on which date and keeps track of how many times u download pictures and etc. after all i think this product is worth the money and it's more like a 'TOY' to keep those out there to be happy with:slickness, James bond perhaps.

Aparently, this camera takes better pictures than most of the other big cameras out there - even those with more pixels! HA! I have so much fun with this camera.. the best part about it is its size... you could walk by people and take pics of them without them even noticing... you could feel like james bond! Let's see what else... Oh yeah, the camera loads up SUPER fast - even WITH a 128mb SD card in there. The flash works great too... I could take pictures in a pitch black room and my tiny little exilim will illuminate whatever its taking a picture of... its great... also, the battery charging time.... the box SAYS 2 hours... NOPE.... more like 1.5 hours which is a big difference for some busy people like me. well... the only negative comment i have to give is that there's no OPTICAL zoom... but... I'm not much of a landscape person anyway... one may think that I'm making excuses for the lack of zoom; however, if you're one of those point and shoot people like me (and not one of those \"wait... a little more to the left\" kinda people) you will have more fun taking pictures than you would've ever imagined.
