I searched the internet, even searched on ebay before coming back to the more trustworthy Amazon. At the time of my purchase the Nikon Coolpix L820 black camera was $219 and in red it was $258. I wasn't willing to pay almost $40 more for a color, so I searched more for about a week. Then I found this refurbished one in plum (the description stated that it is refurbished by the manufacturer, Nikon) so what could be better than that?  I read the lone review stating how their camera was \"just like new.\" I took and chance and to my delight, my camera came looking and working just like new! No scratches, dents or flaws. The only difference I can see is that it has a generic box but it is filled with all of the cables, wires, instruction booklet and even a pack of double AA batteries. I am also pleasantly pleased with the plum color (that I wasn't so sure about, but took a chance because the savings was soo good). Anyway, I couldn't be happier and I liked saving of almost $100 bucks! Oh, and it came with a 90 day warranty! The company was Beach Camera.", "Date": "February 4, 2014"}, {"Title": "Excellent camera for the money", "Author": "David in Lex \"David\"", "ReviewID": "RQ0878TF4NVUL", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "The Nikon long lens is really amazing. The camera seems to have a huge depth of field on long-lens closeups. I think this is because it has high-quality optics in combination with the high quality CMOS low-light sensor. What this means is that the camera can take long-lens closeups while still retaining a relatively small lens opening. If you take, say a closeup of a bird in a tree using the long lens, the bird will be in focus, but also the background that is at a different distance from the camera than the bird.  My experience with SLR cameras employing long lenses is that you could get the subject in focus but the background at a different distance ends up fuzzy. This is a fun camera to experiment with, and in particular to see how good quality point-and-shoot cameras have come relative to the much more bulky and expensive DSLRs. There may be places where a bulky DSLR has an advantage, in particular, in making very large paper prints, but 99 % of photography nowadays is not printed out in 16\" x 20\" paper. I think it would be fun to take the exact same long-lens photo using this camera and a $500+ DSLR setup, print it out maybe at 11\" x 17\" and see exactly what the differences are!.", "Date": "March 5, 2014"}, {"Title": "YAY!", "Author": "I_bought_it", "ReviewID": "RLW93KGX1HSQY", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "so I got this and started using it right away. its so nice and worth the price.

It comes loaded with exposure presets for virtually any situation, it is packed with features and takes very, very nice pictures at very high resolution. It allows for easy exposure compensation, but it does not allow for ANY manual setting of aperture or shutter speed. Programs include a \"Museum\" setting, which will not allow the flash to operate -- very useful in many situations other than museums, in which the accidental firing of a flash could be annoying.

I'm a Nikon DSLR shooter already and this is a fantastic walk around camera! I take it with me everywhere. While it won't fit well in a purse, it's perfect for a backpack or small camera case like the small Case Logic Xbody. The crisp detail in the photos was a real surprise! Even at a full zoom the quality is comparable to the full out quality in my 70-300mm lens on the D90. The file size makes for an easily editable photo as well. Lots of data to work with and very little quality degradation in a fairly close crop. Of course, it won't stand up to DSLR standards on all fronts. You can't shoot in MASP but you do have some control over White Balance and ISO. It has Single and Continuous shooting modes as well as a timer but no remote functionality. Small price to pay for a nice little camera to use every day. I'm also impressed with the in-camera editing! Lot's of good tools to choose from in a P&S;! It also has a decent range of 'scene' modes to choose from and they function very well.
