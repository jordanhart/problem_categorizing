It's very easy to use. Each setting gives you a little onscreen description without you having to dig out the instruction booklet each time. It's point and shoot, takes AA batteries as opposed to lithium ones, and it's small in size so you could tuck it right into your pocket or purse if you wanted. I'm still getting used to the settings myself, but with as easy as it is to review and delete the photos you've already taken, it's not a big deal if I get one or two I don't like in the process. Plus, the clarity of the pictures is fantastic. Great for a first time digital camera owner, or someone who likes to travel light on vacation. And after shopping around, Amazon had the best price.I'm really glad I purchased this camera when I did because now I can use it to take photos during the holidays. And with the camera bag and battery charger that Sony sells for this camera, it'll be easy to take with me, not to mention comforting to know that I can always recharge my batteries wherever I am if need be. Plus, SanDisk sells compatible memory cards for this camera at affordable prices, so you'll never have to worry about running out of room for photos.", "Date": "November 1, 2007"}, {"Title": "Great Compact Camera", "Author": "E.

Berry", "ReviewID": "RGHHVYDTTN2TX", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "To say I'm disappointed with this camera is a complete understatement.  I got this camera for Christmas, and upon my first use was not satisfied with the pictures, but thought it was just a matter of reading the instruction manual and adjusting the settings.  I read all of the reviews on here as well as other sites and followed suggestions re: the camera settings, and nothing works.  My photos turn out extremely blurry and/or grainy; the color is really off (weird orange-y hue, despite experimenting with the color settings on the camera menu); the flash is too bright for nighttime indoor shots, which are the majority of my photos, even though I decreased the flash brightness.  Without fail, if I ask someone else to take the picture, it turns out blurry...  the only reason maybe half of the ones I take personally don't turn out blurry is because I literally stop breathing as I push the button knowing that I have to be as still as death in order to get a somewhat precise shot.  Sometimes the picture looks like it is fine when reviewing it on the camera's LCD screen, but then when I upload it to my computer it is awful.  I'm so frustrated with this camera as I feel I've lost out on some great memories because it is a terrible product.  At this point, I doubt we can return it, so it has been a complete waste of our time and money.

Ross", "ReviewID": "R1OQDDTLB6QGZH", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "Sony Cybershot S700 7.2MP Digital Camera with 3x Optical ZoomOK, here's my impressions of this camera. I have never owned a digital camera before. I just wanted a simple point and shoot to take pics for Ebay. I do not care for bells and whistles. I just want to do what a point and shoot is for. I want to take it out of the box and take pics. There are many things to like about this camera. I dropped it twice on a wooden floor from a height of 3 feet and no damage, so it's built tough. The buttons are not very intuitive, but the manual is easy to read and understand. It is easy to load and use the included editing software. I especially like that when you plug the usb cable into the camera, the editing software automatically pops up and asks you if you want to download. Very handy! Someone mentioned it's easy to accidently delete pics. No it's not. You have to first hit the disp button, then the delete button, then tab up to highlight delete, then hit enter. It would be very hard to accidently delete a shot. There are several cons with this camera. One, the usb protector cover is very flimsy rubber, and it's only a matter of time before it breaks. There is little in camera editing available. You can rotate, resize, or reduce red-eye, but that's about it. The included software lets you do this as well, but only has a few more editing tricks. You can adjust brightness, sharpness, tone, or crop. There is an automatic feature which is somewhat usefull. If you're serious about your pics looking their best, you will need a professional software program. Here are my biggest dislikes, which is why I give it 3 stars. A camera should take good pics right? Well, this does but only if you have surgeons hands. There is no image stabilizer in this camera. My hand shakes slightly, and most of my pics have been blurry because of this. I thought a tripod would help, but the tripod dock is on the left. This makes it easy to tip the camera over when using this, which is how mine got dropped twice. It should be in the center. The shutter button needs to be pressed half-way to focus, and then fully to take the pic. This requires too much pressure, which again makes a steady shot difficult when your finger moves the camera. The low iso setting is useless for close-ups. Pics were dark and grainy. It would only be good for long shots where the flash won't work. I will be trading this camera for one with an image stabilzer. Since even most entry-level cameras have that these days, I'd say the DSC700 is seriously outdated. If you have steady hands, and can get this really cheap like I did, it's a good entry-level camera. But unless you have surgeons hands, I'd look elsewhere.", "Date": "January 5, 2008"}, {"Title": "Amazing Camera", "Author": "Varun Pauddar \"Varun Pauddar\"", "ReviewID": "R3SV3PLIWY3HKD", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I brought the camera for my parents.... and they are loving this smart machine .......... the picture quality is amazing and the camera is handy too ............ the only flaw that I see in this camera is the video quality .......... i am not too satisfied with it.......... say i would give 7 out of 10 for video ............ beyond that ...... must buy item ........... the battery life is good too .......... the preset modes is a big help ....... you don't have to play around with the settings........ it sets it all for you ............ the camera weighs less......... the AV chord helps you view the picture and videos on TV ....... overall i would rate 9 out of 10 ........", "Date": "November 29, 2007"}, {"Title": "Love this camera!", "Author": "K.

About seven months later, mine stopped working. It was still under warrenty, so I sent it to the Sony repair shop to get fixed. I was sent back a different, refurbished camera, told this is what they had, so this is what I got. Three months ago, one of the daughter's cameras broke, exact same problem-first you think the batteries aren't working, next it doesn't turn on all of the time, lastly, it stops working. Not under warrenty anymore, so too bad. Four nights ago, my other daughter said her camera was starting to show signs of the SAME problem. I called Sony's customer support.

Overall, I rate it as just ok.  Here are the pros:-easey to use-takes AA batteries, which you can find anywhere as opposed to having to charge the camera ( which I most likely will forget to do!)-slim classy look, can fit in a pocket-nice sized LCD panel-Movies from the camera came out very nice :), although you have to hook camera to tv or download movie to computer to view.  Cannot view on the camera itself ( at least I couldn't)Now the cons:-Picture quality is inconsistent.  When pictures are printed, you can see shadows around objects in the pictures, strange colors ( green) and some noise-File sizes are HUGE , depending on setting.  Right now, I am using 3.1, the pictures are over 1 MB each.  Have not experimented with the other settings yet.-NO IMAGE STABILIZATION-THIS IS A BAD THING!  I am occassionally frustrated because some of the pictures ocme out blurry, or I have to take pictures over and over.  The \"vibration icon\" comes on to the screen many times.  My advice would be to get a larger memory stick and be prepared to take at least 4-5 pictures in a row so you can get at least one good shot hopefully --Oh, and a VERY patient subject to be photographed will definitely help.I researched for quite a while before purchasing this, and the price was definetly good for the ease of use.  But if I could, I would take it back and buy something else that had image stabilization, cause this is the main thing I don't like about the camers.  Loved being able to use the AA batteries.  Battery life seems to be ok, no complaints here-but I keep spare ones in the case.ONE MORE IMPORTANT THING:  If you take the memory card out and take it to the drugstore to one of those self-print photo kiosks, PLEASE NOTE that the pro duo media will not fit the the slot that says \" memory stick\" because it is too small ( especially those at Walgreens and Walmart) It may fit in a Kodak Kiosk, cause they have a small slot.  make sure that you have a SONY ADAPTER when you go to print your pictures, or it will be a pain.  I made the mistake of not doing this, and stuck my card into the memory slot only to find that I had the most difficult time at getting it out of there, and the store was closing at the time.  I finally fished it out with a cardboard.  Save yourself the frustration and buy an adapter ( you can buy them separate right here on Amazon or it comes free with the Sony brand only of memory sticks).", "Date": "March 17, 2008"}, {"Title": "Sony Cybershot S700 7.2MP Digital Camera with 3x Optical Zoom", "Author": "K.

The Sony CyberShot DSC-S700 is awesome! It takes great pictures and the software that comes with it is great.The only thing that I had a problem with was the software. When I first put the CD-ROM in, a pop-up said something like \"Unidentified graphic/picture\". But that was no problem, all I had to do was take the CD out and put it right back in.I highly recommend purchasing this product, it's great!", "Date": "February 10, 2008"}, {"Title": "Pretty darn good camera", "Author": "DaMan0320", "ReviewID": "R3B2ISYFW1YJPO", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I bought this camera and am pretty happy with it.

A lot of the time the pictures came out blurry when the timer was used.  But the worse part was the battery life.  At first it was okay, but after a few uses it would run out the battery as quickly as I put them in.  At first I thought they must've been bad batteries, but it kept happening after putting in brand new batteries three times!  I'd put the new batteries in and five minutes later it would say low battery and then it'd shut down.  I'm very disappointed with this Sony product.

Good things about the camera are its sleek design, battery life and decent pricing. However, the image stabilization is very bad, and almost 50% of the pictures go blur. We have a 18mon old, and mainly wanted to use this as the camera to click his pictures. We have lost a lot of wonderful moments due to the bad image stabilization of this camera. The focus and the click - both on the same button - are highly confusing... it has blurred pictures by changing focus on the subject during clicking. Many pictures also have green-brown dots on them, which are very visible when the images are downloaded.May be this camera is suitable for stagnant subjects to be clicked.
