My wife and I are usually downstairs, and our two little girls sleep upstairs. And we often want to see how they're doing when they're upstairs:1. Are they asleep or awake? We wonder this (1) shortly after we put them down for naps or for bed, (2) periodically while they are supposed to be sleeping, and (3) when we anticipate them waking up.2. Are they OK? We may wonder this if we hear a strange noise or hear them crying or simply want to check on them for peace of mind--whether they're playing or supposed to be sleeping.We used to creep upstairs as silently as we could and crack open a bedroom door to check on them, but often this would wake them up.So I researched baby monitors and security cameras to see if I could find one that meets five criteria:1. Wireless. We wanted to mount it in our children's rooms, where there are no computers, modems, or routers.2. Streaming. We wanted to easily stream the video on a computer (Mac or PC), iPhone (or other web-enabled smartphone), iPod Touch, and iPad--whether connected to the Internet via our home WiFi or another way when away from home.3. Day/Night. We wanted a clear picture regardless of the lighting in the room.4. Audio. We wanted the option to hear as well as see what's happening.5. Secure. We wanted the video to be password-protected.We decided to get a Sharx Security Camera, which meets all five criteria, and we love it. We use it constantly day and night. We recently added a second one.The camera has other features beyond the above criteria (e.g., DVR recording, motion detection, timed emails, FTP uploads). Installation is not difficult if you follow the instructions, and the email customer service is prompt and helpful (info@sharxsecurity.com).", "Date": "November 20, 2011"}, {"Title": "Great product. Awesome service", "Author": "Arrhenius", "ReviewID": "R32HJJXYXXH79E", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "We own 3 Sharx cameras. If we need any more, we will likely stick with Sharx.Setup:Setting up ANY ip camera can be complicated -- your wifi router, Internet service provider, and general computer situation is very specific to you. If you live in an apartment building that provides Internet service you may have firewalls or other security measures in place that require additional setup steps for ANY ip camera to work. The Sharx camera is easy to set up on your own if you are an intermediate level computer user. If you are not, the Sharx folks will literally talk you through setup step by step until yours is working. They are helpful and patient.iPhone iPad Android compatible:I have no idea why the other reviewer said that this doesn't work well with iOS devices. It is simply not true. It's an IP camera - you need to get an app for viewing IP camera videos.  I am watching my kids on my iPhone with ease right now using the NetcamViewer app. Plug in the IP address and port the camera is on and specify its a Sharx and it works no problem.Nighttime viewing:This gives a great night time feed. You do need to take care on camera placement, however. The camera has a dim red ring of lights at night that are easily reflected off of some high gloss or mirrored surfaces. These reflections degrade camera performance. With proper placement, night vision is great. This is better than your regular baby video monitor because you aren't restricted by the strength of the cameras signal.Record function:You can monitor what's going on with a live feed. Or you can go back and look at what's on the miniSD card. This function really gives you peace of mind. We set ours on a loop of XX hours. Want to know what percentage of time the nanny was on her phone yesterday. You can check! We did a 'dry run' to make sure we had set up everything properly. I would recommend such testing to anyone who needs to be able to go back and review. ( I certainly would if I was counting on this monitoring my business, or in my case my kids!) Our record function let us review what really happened when our daughter had an accident under the Nanny's care.Clarity:The lens on this camera is a significant step up from previous Sharx models. ( we also own the 2606 and the 2607 in addition to this one.)  This one covers an area that is 40' long, and it is high enough resolution to really see what is going on at the very end. It is sharp in both day and night viewing. I do wish there was a way to force the night time viewing on in low light conditions, though.Customer service:After 2 years, our 2606 model stopped working. This was beyond warranty, but the Sharx folks let us trade up for this version for just a bit more that the price difference between the two.", "Date": "April 24, 2013"}, {"Title": "Pretty nice camera", "Author": "SVGuy \"SVGuy\"", "ReviewID": "R2CZ7IE2DKUDU5", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I bought this camera (white) due to user reviews.  My main requirement was that the ip camera has to have its own DVR.  The Sharx has that and on top of that user reviews raved about the Sharx customer support.  Cust support was very responsive and complete but the camera did take me about an hour to set up as my ip forwarding was not working correctly but Sharx did figured out that my firmware needed upgrading.  Once done it worked as advertised.  The IR did not worked so well for me because I had to turn it off as my camera has to monitor our drive way through a window.  This caused my night videos to be black and white but I understand that this is a limitation with other cameras as well.  The range is pretty good as it was still recording from one end of the house to the second floor. The night video is sometime choppy...but the recording was pretty smooth.One thing I wanted to point out is that the micro SD capacity was not mention on the Sharx web site so I purchased a 32GB micro SD for longer recording at the same time as I ordered the Sharx from Amazon but when the camera arrived the Sharx manual mentioned that it was limited to 16GB.  I formatted the 32GB SD and stuck it into the camera and it shows available size as 32GB so it worked after all...", "Date": "March 26, 2012"}, {"Title": "Fully Loaded", "Author": "toonpixels", "ReviewID": "R37F9UN6BGKSQZ", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I ordered 3 of these bad boys and so far the only problem I've had is one of the cameras had to be rebooted manually (unplug). The setup was pretty easy. I was able to get these configured and running within two hours which included installing DD-WRT firmware on a new TP-LINK TL-WR1043ND Ultimate Wireless N Gigabit Router instead of using a 2wire wireless gateway. When I ordered these I didn't realize it supported Wireless N, so that's a bonus on my part.  I'm also able to use Google Chrome to view and hear.  I installed the quicktime and activex plugin for chrome, and I disabled the 3D acceleration in Quicktime. Just click on \"primary stream\", allow permission, and it works.  If you are on a Mac using Safari, just click on \"primary stream\". Should start playing without having to install plugins.For my DNS i used \"No IP\". They give you 3 free hosts, which is something I couldn't see on DynDNS. All I saw was options to pay :(I've only had these for 4 days and will continue to update as time goes by, but so far so good. I haven't messed with the quality much, but right now I'm using 16GB memory card and at best quality i'm getting 3 days of recording, but I will be dropping the quality to something less intensive.  Should give me at least a couple of weeks based on my experience with other cameras.Again, great cameras and setup was as easy as I've seen.  The manual book is very easy to follow incase you get stuck.I hope these continue to run and impress as time passes by.  Oh, and I use an iPhone as my mobile device and picture quality looks good.

I ordered the wireless this time so I did not have to run a Category 5 cable to the device; well worth the extra cost otherwise you spend about 1/2 the savings on cable.  It was easy to set up and no problems.  This camera is set up at a remote cabin.  It is fun to watch the animals go by, determine how much snow is on the ground, and in general see what is going on outside.  The camera is located inside a window looking out so it is not exposed to the elements.  It works great during the day to see outside but because of how infrared works you cannot see outside at nights (infrared reflects off the glass window).  The second camera is set up to see what is inside the cabin; I\u2019m able to see what is going on inside 24 hours a day.  Early in the morning and late in the evening I\u2019m able to see through the glass windows a great distance otherwise just what is on the deck.  The heating system controls has a motion sensor that gets activated once in a while; probably by the bears and mountain lions we\u2019ve seen on the deck while staying at the cabin. When the sensor goes off,  I\u2019m able to log-in and see what is going on without driving four hours to investigate.

While it's not a simple plug and play set up - with a little patience and some trial and error the Sharx VIPcella is the top of the market baby cam. I have had this camera for almost a year now and would highly recommend it to anyone with some tech savvy. Someone who does not play well with gadgets probably shouldn't mess around with this device. If you can handle getting on the phone and carry a conversation with Sharx's extremely proficient and helpful customer support, this camera is well worth the investment. When your kid grows up you can use it for other purposes including security.

I wanted a solution that was open and let me use whatever software I wanted to.The Sharx camera was light on documentation.  It does walk you through using their web interface to access the camera, which works well, but didn't have much in the form of software advice for my iPhone.  After trying several, I settled on LiveCams Pro, which has done an excellent job.However, the most telling experience with my Sharx wifi camera came when my toddler knocked it off the crib before I attached it, breaking the wifi antenna.  I emailed Sharx, asking which replacements were compatible and if I could purchase a longer-range one.  Sharx answered within hours, and offered to mail me, free of charge, not only a replacement antenna but also a taller long-range one!  Amazing customer service to replace for free a hard-to-find part even though it wasn't even remotely their fault.

Lee", "ReviewID": "R3TKPP8LQL8BND", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Purchased several of these to replace Panasonic network cameras in my set up mainly for the night vision capabilities, including one as a baby monitor.  The IR LEDs are a nice feature.  The included instructions are very detailed, well-written and helpful.  I'd encourage buyers to read thoroughly.  Even though I didn't need it for setting things up, email support is prompt.  I was inquiring about advanced features.  Overall, I'm very impressed with the build quality, instructions, and support.  Features such as the multi-window motion detection are also a nice touch.For the benefit of Mac users, they do include instructions specific for AirPort and Time Capsule setups.  My setup was on a Mac with a TIme Capsule and a Buffalo NAS for recording alarms.  Connecting to a DDNS provider for remote viewing was also easy.  I mostly access the cameras through an iPhone app (Netcamviewer) and otherwise through Firefox or Safari with no problems.  Having Internet Explorer is nice if you want to have the ability to view the motion detection thresholds being triggered, but you can fine tune the settings in any browser.  If using IE, use the 32-bit version (not 64-bit) - it's mentioned in the manual, but I'd skipped over it.I do miss the pan-tilt features of the Panasonic, more so because it allows for easier installation (you can point and adjust after the fact).  Most applications that I have don't require the pan-tilt afterwards during normal operation.  The Sharx has a slimmer profile, although I wish the included mounting bracket was smaller.  It's a sturdy bracket, but just relatively large. Panasonic cameras also have an IR sensor in addition to motion detection, which proves more flexibility for triggering.", "Date": "May 19, 2012"}, {"Title": "Great Camera Excellent Customer Service", "Author": "B.

The Cameras themselves are well constructed and easy to install.  The SCN2700 is new in the lineup and does correct the color issues associated with the older SCN2607.  It also has a better wireless range and true color in daylight. The only issue I have had with this Camera is the nighttime LEDS are very bright and if you have them pointing at any kind of light surface, they can over expose the picture - It just needs a little careful positioning and selection to overcome this. It would be great if they could add an LED brightness adjustment control to either the Camera with a switch or to the software (even better!).  The reason I give this Camera 5 stars is the great customer service I received from this company.  Having my nearly 3 year old SCN 2607 have a couple of the LEDS fail, they still offered to repair it FOC or sell me a newer SCN2700 at \u00bd price! What companies out there (especially IT / Computer companies) still offer customer service like that and stand behind their products?Bottom Line:- If you are looking for a home or small business Wireless or IP security Camera and you have concerns about installing yourself; - then these are the Cameras you should select - This company will not let you fail!

There may be a better solution so do your homework, then visit the app's website to see what cameras work best and that have audio support.This camera was not compatible with any baby monitor app.  I ended up buying a Foscam FI8910W at half the price of this one and it is widely supported (including the app mentioned above).  Additionally, the Foscam is motorized and fully controllable within most baby monitor apps.#2: Picture/Audio quality (B)On my PC through my home stereo the audio quality was poor.
