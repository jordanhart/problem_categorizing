Loomis \"AL\"", "ReviewID": "R3TDJM48PG61O4", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "Although a great idea I purchased 6 of these camers's,the directions were horribly written,the camera doesn't record correctly there is no motion sensor that works at all, & if it does record at all it does less than 1 min. maybe 20 seconds then quits or it will record for a second & flickers. Terriblly made. Don't waste you money on it. Trying 6 of them hoping maybe 1 or 2 were defective but all 6 did the same thing.They need to go back to the drawing board & start from scratch. The area to put in the SD card on the back where the space is I have very tiny fingers & it was an effort to get that in then you have to use tweezers to pull it back out of the camera, again poorly designed, If you want it just for a clothing hook that is the only value of this item. I would have given it 0 stars but you had to put at least 1 to review.", "Date": "May 16, 2012"}, {"Title": "Clothes hook camera", "Author": "Atv9249", "ReviewID": "R5XHVSD1M7T8", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I really wish I had not wasted my money on this..  While both of the cams I bought did work..  The field of view is terrible..  Trying to get the settings right was hard enough.  And the motion detection really don't work..  It will record once , when you first turn it on then after that 90% of the time it won't turn back on. My opinion is this..  Spend the extra and get something that works the way it's supposed to.  By the way the clothes hook is like 5 inches long..  Don't even make sense for it to be so big...", "Date": "November 18, 2012"}, {"Title": "Does not work!", "Author": "Jogeesh \"Nam\"", "ReviewID": "R3V02FBG4L9VB8", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "This item came with poor English instructions and is no help knowing how to use the \"long press button\".
