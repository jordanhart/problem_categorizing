It's easy to use and learn all the functions.  Before buying this camera I looked at a number of cameras.  I picked this one because of cost, zoom, and mega pixels.  I looked at the Kodak z740 which is being replaced by this model and for a few more dollars you can get this model which takes better quality pictures and has the histogram feature.A read reviews and a number of people complained about having the zoom without image stabilization.  Well, when I took pictures at full zoom, even using the digital zoom, the picture was shaky in the view finder but came out clear.  The 10x zoom is very nice even without image stabilization.The price of this camera for the features is incredible.  That is why I picked this camera over others.  Read the reviews.  This camera gets good reviews, even from the professionals.

I bought it in hopes of replacing the Canon Sure shot that I had that took blurry pictures. This camera is the nicest digital camera I have seen. It is below a SLR digital, when in reality, it takes about the same kinds of photos as an SLR digital. If you are a professional photographer, you could do wonders with this camera and get awesome results. The LCD screen will show up fuzzy when viewing the image..BUT, once you take the photo, it comes out crystal clear. I am very much pleased with the performance of this camera. When I figure out how to work the image sharing on Amazon, I will show you some sample images from some of the modes the camera offers. I think anyone who buys this camera, and reads about all of the features and knows how to work it properly will love it. Like anything, you need to read instructions to see how it works, what does what, etc. From each mode I tried, this camera took a nice clear shot with amazing detail. Anyone who buys this camera will not be disapointed. It is a quality item. Also, very light weight and small. Great camera with a very affordable price.", "Date": "May 31, 2006"}, {"Title": "Fabulous camera for the money.", "Author": "Keith Blodgett \"Hawk\"", "ReviewID": "RRTYXYS6PD6C2", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This is my second Kodak digital camera and like my old one I just love it. Flat out it takes some of the best pictures I've seen or taken for that matter. It's rich in features. From almost full manual PASM control to automatic point and shoot to multiple 'scene' settings for differing situations. Power up to first picture is quite quick. Shutter lag is quite small (no more missing those action shots!). The 10x optical zoom does lack stabilization but in good light and with a good shooting stance you won't generate much image shake. Macro photography is, as I've experienced in the past with my CX4230, exceptional although using the flash for extreme close-up work can generate shadows on the image due to the location of the flash unit. Natural light and no flash eliminate this problem. That all being said I do have some complaints; The door covering the memory card slot feels flimsy and could easily be damaged or broken. The 'joystick' used for navigating the menus is small and hard to use for fumble fingered guys like me. It takes some getting used to and can slow you down changing modes or settings if you're in a hurry. The camera seems to have some trouble getting focus in low light (I like to shoot at the beach at sunrise) and the extremely bright and annoying green 'low light assist' lamp cannot be turned off even though the Kodak FAQ page for the Z650 says it can be. All in all though, this is a great camera! It's got some heft to it so it feels like a real camera and not a tourist toy. It comes with a (plastic) 55mm adapter which allows you to fit any number of filters to the camera, though the included lens cap will not attach to a standard 55mm filter. Speaking of the lens cap, it's the one true disappointment with this camera, it does not stay on very well at all. The slightest tap and it will fall off. This can be somewhat solved by leaving the 55mm adapter on the camera as the cap fits that much better. I highly recommend this camera to anyone looking for an ultra-zoom model for a good price. You can't go wrong here.", "Date": "November 16, 2006"}, {"Title": "5 stars for what it is", "Author": "Mr. Sergiy Lyakh \"Serge\"", "ReviewID": "R1J538EW5HB420", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Just got the camera. I used to own Canon S70, which is better in everything besides the zoom. Unfortunately, my old canon was stolen, so I had to look for a temporary replacement, until I can afford a nicer one. Well, my search stopped at this Kodak. I got it for $200 only, which is great.Everything works great so far. I cannot comment on the life of batteries, but I bought 4 recharchable ones and a recharger, so I doubt I would ever run out of power. I also got a 512M card, as the medium picture size is around 2-2.5M each.Zoom works fine. I would say it's great for such camera. Of course you cannot zoom fully and expect that leaves on a tree would be in perfect focus, but it takes great pics in full zoom, so if you question that capability, disregard all negative feedback on this issue.It takes pics in nice color. I would say 'full' color. Blue is blue and green is green. I've heard that Kodaks were good in this, so i can only confirm that rumor now.As for the rest of functions, I have not had enough time yet to experiment with everything, as the school has already started for me, so I only have so much each day to devote to my new toy.I hope I'll have time in a week or so to post more comments on other features, but to all who are considering this camera, I would say this:it's not too small, but fits in one hand nicely,it's 6M pixel, so takes nice resolution pics, which are below 3M eachit has nice zoomit takes nice colorSo, for this camera with its price, I gave it 5 stars. If you are looking for superior performance or quality, look at cameras that start at $700 or $800 - you would not find anything in this price range that would satisfy your need. (I am looking into buying a $800 camera myself, so I've done a lot of research trying to get a nicer bargain with a cheaper camera and found out that there is too much of a gap between any 'cheap' camera and what I really want).Hope I could be helpful", "Date": "September 4, 2006"}, {"Title": "Great Buy!", "Author": "R.

The manufacturers only focus on the camera details.  While this a great camera, the software and limitations of the proprietary Easy Share program make uploading your pictures a terrible experience.  If you are happy with the Easy Share software, this camera will work fine for you.  However, if you are like me and prefer to use advanced photo editing programs, you will despise this camera.  Yes, it comes with a USB connection.  But Kodak has limited you so that ONLY the Easy Share software recognizes the camera to transfer pictures.  You cannot access the camera or pictures through My Computer, Windows Explorer, or any other photo software.  You MUST use the Easy Share program to transfer pictures, and then they go into Kodak \"albums\" in the software.  I did not believe this could possibly be true with a USB connection, but after spending 20 minutes on the phone with Kodak support, I was assured it was designed this way.  The camera will not be recognized by Windows XP or anything other than the Kodak Easy Share software.  Besides this being annoying, it is problematic if your software crashes and you have no other means to get your photos off your camera.It is cumbersome to continually switch the photo destination to this or that folder if you choose to organize them differently.  Kodak always wants to create a new folder within a folder.  It's truly awful.  The software also does not display the photo name, size, date taken, etc.  You can resize only by printed size (4x6, etc) as opposed to pixels.  For many users the software will be fine, but if you are accustomed to advanced photo editing, organizing, and so on, you will be severely limited.I am debating between returning my camera because of the software issues, or buying an SD card reader to read my pictures independent of Kodak's software.", "Date": "October 19, 2006"}, {"Title": "No zoom in movie mode.

I attached the 55mm adapter that's provided with the camera and use a standard 55mm lens cap with a cap-keeper. It makes the whole camera a little more bulky but it's worth it.

I'm no pro, but I think I would qualify above the average everyday camera user.  I chose the z650 for various reasons including 10X zoom, 6MP, Kodak easy-share system, and because it is a good camera for beginers looking to take the next step up in overall photo quality.  I never opened the manual and was using all the features almost instantly (I would say I'm moderately technology literate), but if you struggle with tech you will probably be reading through the quick start booklet.  The 2.5 camera screen is good for getting an idea of what your shot looks like, but the real photo is much more brilliant and sharp than the what shows on the screen.  Did I mention the ease of use factor.  Get the UV filter for the camera, they're cheap and really help with outside shots! Also, plan on getting a large memory card and an additiona set of rechargable lith batteries.

They actually make a difference and really help with the focus and quality of the picture. I find everything about this camera great. All the buttons are in easy-to-find places, the screen display is really nice, the zoom really closes in on your subject, and you can go from automatic to manual settings really easily. I've been taking my pictures at a 6.0 resolution, and it stills takes the picture fast.The camera is a little bulky, but it's still a fairly small camera. I really haven't found the weight to be an issue as it's not as heavy as perceived.The only drawback I find is that the display screen appears to be slightly grainy when you're taking the picture. When you actually load the pictures or look it at on the review, it's not grainy at all. It's only a slight drawback though, but it's really the only thing I find to not be as great as it could be. You also want to make sure you push the button down ALL the way when you're taking a picture.Overall, I find this camera to be wonderful.

It was a ridiculous impulse buy--I already own 4 digital cameras ... the last thing I needed was another camera! But what a delighful suprise this camera turned out to be! It's come the closest to rivaling the image quality of my old Olympus C-740.I had never seriously looked at Kodak cameras ... I always steered clear of them based on bad press and negative comments about them from my friends who are \"serious\" photographers.But I couldn't be happier with this little bargain ... it basically serves the need I wanted to fill -- a 6mp camera that takes the kind of quality shots I was used to with my C-740.There are a few negatives in that it can be a little slow in processing the shots, but there is very little shutter-lag when taking the shots. I've gotten some amazing birds-in-flight shots with it--something I've never been able to accomplish with any of my other cameras, including the C-740. Some low-contrast shots come out a bit noisy, but for the most part the shots are very crisp and sharp. It handles low-light settings better than any of the others in this class that I've tried.At less than a third of the price of my Canon S2-IS, this little camera outclasses the others by a mile.I stumbled on to a good find in the Z650 ... it's not going to give you DLSR quality photos, but no point-and-shoot will.This camera is perfect for any one who likes to take great outdoor and wildlife shots.

The A402 only had digital zoom. If you are not familiar with the differences between optical and digital zoom I can sum it up for you... optical zoom is what you want, digital is really a non-functional catch phrase and basically means, no useable zoom. I take lots of outdoor shots and lots of distance shots where I knew a 10x zoom would be most attractive. This camera works great. There is no image stabilization so I recommend using a tripod anytime you expect to use over 5x zoom. There are lots of settings on this camera and to be quite honest I am still learning the optimum settings for various environments. Shots in the dark require, at least in my experience, the reviewing of a few of the settings to see which works best. Camera is a bit finicky in the dark so be prepared to work through the learning of the settings.I love this camera and I am thoroughly impressed with the images I am capturing.You will want to buy a few things to accompany this camera... a carrying case, a 1GB memory card (about 500+ images at max. res., a good set of rechargeable batteries and charger). The camera does come with a lens adapter which also, in my case, serves as a bit of protection for the lens.

I am an avid nature photographer so most of my work is taken in the outdoors.  After hundreds of pictures and all kinds of weather here's the lowdown...Pros ... Picture quality is amazing even after zooming the full 10X (I never go into digital zoom because of low quality of pictures, although this camera isn't too bad after complete full optical and digital zoom).  Prints that I've made up to 16X20\" (haven't gone larger, but I know I can) are extremely impressive and are as crisp as viewing a 4x6.  It is easy to use and the functions are easy to get to with the use of the joystick.  The stabilization at full 10X zoom is incredible also.  It appears really shaky through the window, but pictures continue to turn out crisp.  Close-ups are clear and reveal amazingly clear details.  The movie feature works better indoors than the regular camera portion (read cons).Cons ... Indoor shooting is limited because the flash isn't strong enough.  When at a school chorus concert, the pictures turned out fuzzy and unclear.  Award ceremonies, the pictures turned out once again unusable in my standards.  The zoom is fixed when using the movie feature so you need to have the zoom set before beginning a movie.  This camera seems to eat batteries, especially in the winter months.  I am always on the go, and when I go to pull out the camera I find the camera lens cover has fallen off yet again.  It comes off way to easily causing smudges and smears on the lens so I must always have lens cleaner wipes on me.

The camera has a great feature that adjusts the exposure in low light conditions. When you're indoors and there is fairly good light you really shouldn't use the flash. It makes the pics darker than if taken without.Tip #2: While the zoom on this camera is outstanding the pictures (as expected) get very \"grainy\" once you get into the digital zoom.

Jones \"games4gamers\"", "ReviewID": "R1P98OYLDFU4MN", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "I don't recall if I bought this camera from Amazon or not, but I've owned it a few years now and it's served it's purpose fairly well, but overall I'm left with a \"meh\" feeling regarding it. The zoom function is a pain to use in my experience. There is a horizontal line that indicates how far in or out you are zoomed, which is fine I guess, but a percentage indicator would be much more useful than a simple line. I have no way of telling how far zoomed it is for instances where the batteries die right after a shot and I want to take another shot at the same zoom setting. That's another issue right there, the zoom resets if your batteries die, which I guess is to be expected, but it's still annoying.Another major problem is the battery life, which to put mildly, is horrible. I have 2650 mAh rechargeables (Duracell brand) and when they're fully charged I'm lucky to get 5-10 pictures before the camera shuts off. That's simply ridiculous and inexcusable. I'm not sure if it's a problem with the camera or the batteries themselves, but I'm included to believe it's the camera because I also have 2450 Energize rechargeables and they do the same thing, but yet they work fine in other electronics (such as video game controllers and the like). I feel like I either am forced to buy an AC adapter or to keep a supply of 20+ batteries on hand just to be able to get through 1 day of photography.I mainly use the camera to take pictures of products for my job. I have a tripod and image stabilization is not usually an issue for me, but sometimes the camera seems to struggle to focus. This is especially true if you're zoomed in too far. It does not want to focus at all at that point, and what good are zoomed in photos if they're blurry?Another issue I've found is that some of the more advanced controls are confusing. The user's guide does an okay job of explaining them, but if I recall correctly, it wasn't very detailed. I had to do research online to find out about the different functions and how to use them correctly. That might not be true for everyone since I'm not that experienced with digital cameras, but it's something to note.The camera features several white balance settings, but none of them work that well in my experience. All of my photos turn out too dark even when changing the exposure. I always have to do major editing in Paint Shop Pro, Photoshop, etc. to get the images to look decent. In a related note, the flash doesn't help much with that either. Again, the photos are either too dark or too bright. There's no \"just right\" setting apparently. Granted that was without proper lighting, and having recently acquired better lighting, the camera seems to be working a little better in terms of not being excessively dark, but they still require a good deal of editing. I wish there were a way to just make the background a solid color, a gradient, a pattern, or something else other than what is shown, prior to taking the photo, that way the exposure and all of that only affects the object being photographed.So in summary, it's an okay camera, but there's definitely better out there I'm sure. It'll suffice for average needs, but be sure to either pick up the AC adapter or be prepared to spend a ton of money on batteries and/or recharging batteries every 5-10 photos.", "Date": "May 19, 2011"}, {"Title": "beats any 35mm manual or auto", "Author": "Beverly C.

I've found that the best pictures are taken outdoors, like nature shots - close ups of flowers, etc. Some of those pictures have been breathtaking.The cons are many. Here they are:1. Extremely low battery life (and by the way, it took me a while to find a battery charger that was compatible with the type of batteries this camera takes.)2. Cheap lens cover. Keeps falling off and I enventually lost it. Which makes for a hard experience trying to keep the lens clean.3. VERY slow in processing shots. Granted, I have it on the highest resolution, but my last camera did not do this, even on the highest resolution.4. Long shutter delay, and annoying white screen with the word \"processing\" appears after almost every shot, especially when battery is running low. You cannot do anything while the shot is \"processing,\" and I missed a lot of great photo opportunities while waiting for this \"processesing\" screen to go away.5. Zoom in video mode is fixed. Cannot zoom while videotaping.6. Even after focusing ahead of time in video mode, sometimes video still appeared completely out of focus on screen once I pushed the record button. I missed videotaping my son's piano recital this way, because it just wouldn't focus.7. Takes awful pictures indoors from a distance, even if using zoom mode. (Example: awards ceremonies, etc.)8. Cannot take focused or decent pictures in low light indoors. (I'm sure there is a way to fix this in the settings, but that's my fault for not taking the time to deal with it.)9. Again, pictures are hit or miss. Sometimes they're beautiful, especially the outdoors shots, but sometimes they turn out blurry, even if they appeared focused on the camera screen.10. Camera is BULKY and cumbersome. Definately hard to carry and won't fit in your pocket since the lens does not retract all the way in to the camera.11. Needs image stabilization.12.

They had a sticker on the box that read \"do not inventory\", and, more importantly, another sticker with a new price on it - $99.99!Needless to say, I bought it right up!I wanted to explain that because this is a one-hundred dollar camera to me, so my opinion of it may be a bit skewed.I've owned the Z650 for a few months, and I've gotten to where I feel very comfortable using it.Even for twice the price I got it at, this is a wonderful piece of serious photographic equipment. I know you SLR people are probably laughing at me right now, but it's true.Besides, not all of us like to look through a viewfinder to shoot photos. One nice thing about the Z650 is that you can toggle between the ample LCD and the EVF with the touch of a button. I find myself using the EVF when shooting with the 10X zoom.A note on the zoom feature - it's a 5X DIGITAL zoom, the other five, you're on your own with. Beyond its digital limit, and depending upon the subject, images can get somewhat blurry. This can also be attributed to the camera's lack of image stablization. Kodak Gear (Tiffen) makes an excellent 60\" tripod that can greatly improve upon these minor imperfections. In fact, 47th Street Photo sold it to me (here on Amazon) for $9.95! Great people, and it arrived at my door in two days time using standard shipping...Okay, I'm straying a bit here...The Z650's menus are both easily accessable and easy to understand.In addition to several pre-programmed scene and automatic modes, the camera also gives you the option going fully manual - a must for me, because one of my favorite subjects to photograph is the night sky (a couple of my photographic endeavors can be viewed in the customer images for this camera).

You can tell they are made in China as they are very touchy and break very easy.  Im sure yours will last as long as you dont accidntley bump it on any thing or drop it more than a half an inch.  I paid over two hundrend bucks and here it is, the day before my daughers birthday, it wont turn on because of a slight jare.  Im not joking, its just a slight jar.I know that the waranty is worthless, I triped over the purse that had my camera in it (this is the only thing I can think of that happened to it) and it stoped working.  I had to pay to ship it to the waranty place where they said they wouldnt give me a new one because it had been (dropped).  [...]Forget in Kodak, Im done with you.
