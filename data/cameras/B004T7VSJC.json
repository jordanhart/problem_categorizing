I was advised by AMScope to buy from Amazon.com as it will ship faster which I did. I got the camera quickly but it didn't fit my microscope. The software and driver on the CD was not working!!! I called customer service at AMScope and they directed me to download a new software from the web site. The new software/driver did work but why waste my time for almost1 hour try to figure it out. It was best NOT to include a CD at all and leave instruction to download from the website! The customer service gentlemen simply said we don't gurantee the camera fitting my microscope since the microscope is an Olympus BX41!!!! How come the 3 times I called earlier, they said not to worry as long as my microscope has a C-mount.I would recommend people not to buy AMScope products as their pre-sales and post-sales customer service is misleading.", "Date": "December 24, 2012"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": null, "Features": null, "Name": null, "ImgURL": null, "ProductID": "B004T7VSJC"}}
