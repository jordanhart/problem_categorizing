{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Great Travel Camera", "Author": "BBlair", "ReviewID": "RHO06T7ZQ4G0L", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I did a great deal of research before purchasing this camera because I don't have the time or money that some people apparently have to be doing the eBay revolving door thing. What I came to realize is that, disappointingly, there isn't a clearly superior compact or ultracompact camera out there. There are only cameras with greater or lesser compromises and the trick is finding the one you can live with. The Lumix TZ5 was a good travel companion and turned out to have few flaws.Since it irritates me when people say that they do a great deal of research and then never share it (doesn't that irritate you?), here are some of the cameras I ruled out based on my (maybe not your) criteria:Fujifilm FinePix F100fd (difficult menu design, pink banding issue), Canon PowerShot SD890 IS (reported awful handling and poorly designed controls), Casio Exilim Card EX-S10 (No image stabilization, very slim, picture quality ok, weak zoom, tiny controls), Casio Exilim EX-S880 (No image stabilization, reported poor image quality), Olympus Stylus 850 SW (reportedly poor video shooting, poor battery life), Pentax Optio V10 (No image stabilization), Casio EX-Z1080 (Reduced pixels compared to others, 38mm starting range), Panasonic Lumix DMC-FX55 (Reportedly falls short on image quality, no viewfinder, larger), Ricoh Caplio R7 (No optical viewfinder, very noisy, some barrel distortion when fully extended, poor customer service?, reported quality mediocre), Pentax Optio A40 (Reportedly poor autofocus), and Canon PowerShot A470 (No viewfinder, no image stabilization, weak zoom).Unfortunately, doing all this research meant I didn't get the Lumix TZ5 till right before my trip to Amsterdam - I was literally reading the manual on the plane. I don't recommend this, but it does serve as a good crash test for what the camera could (and could not) do out-of-the-box.As you probably know, this isn't an ultracompact but it is not as big as some reviewers make out. Could fit in a large pocket but it is rather heavy and unprotected in that environment so I got a LowePro case for it that sat on my belt. Worked well, allowed for extra batteries and SD card, and access was quick for candid shots.Things that worked well:* The Intelligent Auto mode worked pretty well for most situations. I suggest studying the exposure compensation settings since I had to use these often in high contrast and full sun situations.* One handed operation works well.* Menu system was pretty intuitive for basic functions.* Zoom is amazing and E.Zoom setting was very useful. Be sure to read how to use the \"extended optical zoom\" which lets you go out to 16.9x at reduced picture quality (I believe you have to have picture quality set at max 9MB and this is then reduced to 3MB). I didn't use the digital zoom.* The screen is gorgeous and the playback is amazing - many people commented on this.* Taking video is pretty easy, though I would have preferred a button rather than having to rotate a dial. Be careful on playback to distinguish between what is a still picture and what is video - I accidentally deleted some video because I thought they were poor still shots, rather than the start of the video.* If the dial is accidentally rotated, the camera will not let you take a picture until you correctly choose an actually setting.* Fairly quick start up - not stellar but not bad.* Can set up something called Travel Date, which will organize pictures by 1st, 2nd, 3rd day. This was useful when sharing pictures and to help you remember the chronology of the trip.* You can zoom while taking video, although more slowly than with still shots.What didn't work well:* No matter what you read, the pretty LCD screen is no replacement for a view finder even when you use the Auto Power LCD option to compensate. In daylight, even on the brightest setting, the screen washes out. Another problem I had was I had to remove my glasses to compose on the screen, which was a hassle with rapidly-moving candid shots. This was the biggest disappointment and I took off one star for this.* Certain functions of the camera will only work in certain settings. For example, you can only set the self-timer for 10 sec in IA mode, histograms cannot be displayed in IA mode, exposure settings can only be used in normal mode, extended optical zoom cannot be used in motion picture mode, etc. It can be frustrating, and you can miss a good shot, if you don't have all that memorized. I imagine all cameras are like this, but thought I would mention it since we are discussing an out-of-the-box experience.* The door to the sockets on the right-hand side comes open easily (does not lock closed but only snaps shut), which is a hassle at times. I am concerned that it will snap off one day.* In my opinion, the flash is underpowered.Overall, I am happy with the TZ5 and impressed with the pictures and video it produced - especially since I had so little experience with it. My friend, who is a film maker by trade, was also impressed with the camera. It is bigger than I would have liked, but the trade off for a 10X zoom was worth it for me.Do get an extra battery - I went through both batteries in 4 hours of shooting, mostly stills but some video. Big hassle to run out of juice in the middle of your day. A SD Extreme III 8GB was recommended in some reviews and it worked well for me, especially with shooting video. In doing research about buying a camera, one of the most helpful websites I found was the \"What Camera Should I Buy?\" forum at the Digital Camera Resource Page - [...]In looking at the reviews here on Amazon for the TZ5, be aware that they are organized by color, so check each color for information about this camera.", "Date": "May 31, 2008"}, {"Title": "If you know what you're getting into, you'll be thrilled", "Author": "New Englander", "ReviewID": "R3QYY339T5VJ0Y", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I already wrote a review on the little sister, the TZ4, which is a phenomenal camera; I am however returning it because the price differential with the TZ5 is so low at this point it made more sense for me to spring for the few extra bucks on the TZ5 .If you read any professional reviews, you already know that this is not the camera for poster size enlargements, even at low ISO values. While the noise reduction has been turned down, there is still some NR smudging  and  noise. Thankfully, the noise at least can be removed to the point where I was able to doctor a sample ISO 1600 picture to look just fine in 4 x 6 size (thanks to NeatImage). And I've had no problems with 8 x 10's at ISO 100 and 200.And guess what? That is THE ONLY issue with this camera, and it is one that all other compact cameras also share to various extents. The difference here is that many other compacts also add lots of other \"negatives\" to the mix, such as severe wide angle distortion, wild and wooly purple fringing, reduced zoom range, and corner blurriness . The TZ 4 and 5 do nothing of the kind.For what you're getting, a compact, POCKETABLE 28 - 280 Leica lens with IS, there simply is nothing like it out there. And that's before even looking at the HD movie mode, the surprisingly accurate intelligent scene selection feature, the brilliant LCD and the jewel-like workmanship.This is the ultimate vacation camera if you plan to leave your DSLR home and travel lightly, and aren't spending all day in museums shooting w/o flash. I highly recommend this camera, especially if you lock in the highest possible ISO value at 400, turn the dial to iA, and then give the camera to a complete newbie to shoot pictures with.

This camera has the best lens in the industry bar none. Leica is superior to any other compact point and shoot lens out there (except other Lumix cameras that all use a Leica Lens). The camera is fast wt start up and can take 3 FPS in sports mode. It packs a 10X optical zoom and on the TZ5 can go up o 17X with some resolution loss. I never use Digital zoom as I do not consider it a zoom.The Camera ergonomics is great, may of the features photographers need are easily accessible and well though of. I have been using the TZ3 for 2 years and took more than 10000 pictures with amazing results. I take many night shots and this is really where this camera excels. It can take 15, 30 and 60 seconds exposures which no other compact can do.Battery life es very acceptable. A second battery is a recommended inexpensive accessory. The camera build quality is good, durable materials and high quality. I have evaluated a huge number of cameras and the Lumix comes on top by far based on its image quality, image stabilization, optical zoom, Leica superior lens, form factor and overall value. The closest camera you can get with similar performance is the Canon SX 100 IS. It is bigger, bulkier, heavier, much much slower and costs about the same. When it comes to compact point and shoot with advanced features and a hefty zoom nothing beats the Lumix.", "Date": "April 2, 2008"}, {"Title": "Great Small Camera!", "Author": "ryecats", "ReviewID": "R3QP0S8DXBIEV7", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I have a Pansonic DMC-FZ7 that takes excellent photos, but is a bit bulky when you don't want to look like a tourist.  I've grown jealous of a friend's Panasonic DMC-TZ3 which he keeps on his belt loop in a Lowepro Rezo 30 case.  It also has a wide angle lens which I don't have on the FZ7.  I've purchased the TZ5 as a second camera for when I want to be a more discreet tourist without a camera bag.  This may become my primary camera.I am not a fan of small cameras as a rule.  Some of them (e.g., Canon Elph) have screens and icons so small, I can't see them.  But this camera has a lot of  features, most also available on the TZ3 & new TZ4.  (The TZ3/TZ4/TZ5 fit into the Lowepro Rezo 30 case, but no room to spare.)The choice of which model to buy depends on your need for Megapixels and what you are willing to spend.  I have used my friend's TZ3 and don't really notice any significant improvements in the workings of the TZ5 that would justify the price for routine point-and-shoot photos.  However, the TZ5 has a 3 inch LCD while the TZ3 & TZ4 only have 2.5 inch.  That was a deciding factor for me.If you need a camera where you look through a traditional view finder to frame your photos, this is not the right camera for you.  I prefer using the LCD screen, so I don't miss this feature.I find the Panasonic menus easy to use to access all of the varied features.  If you just want to use it as a point-and-shoot, it's easy to do.  If you want to experiment, the features are there for you to play with...There is another feature on Panasonic that is an absolute MUST for me.  It is possible to set the flash \"off\" so it doesn't go off when you don't want it to (i.e., in places that restrict flash photography).  Some of my friends have cameras where they have to turn the flash off each time.  And they forget...Another reason I opted for the Pansonic FZ/TZ series is the easy to use battery charger/rechargeable battery.  The batteries that hold their charge for 1-3 days, but I do carry a spare.  I'm not a fan of carrying around AA or AAA batteries.", "Date": "April 7, 2008"}, {"Title": "Amazing Point and Shoot!", "Author": "zarchitect \"PerspectiveZ\"", "ReviewID": "R3H4J5AU1ADBAR", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "[EDITED] 03/29/08: []-indicates modificationsI've had the camera for [about 2 weeks now] so bear in mind that not all the features were tested.  Also, this is my first advanced point and shoot camera so I cannot compare it to others I didn't own.  I've tested the reasons why I chose this particular camera.  The high resolution, compact size (can't really test that except that it fits in my pocket great!), and its ability to shoot high resolution video.The high resolution is amazing but only a 4 star.  4 because there will be much playing around to do in order to get the sharpest possible image.  Perhaps the ISO was set too high, perhaps I didn't use the perfect setting, much playing around to be a perfectionist - and only because I am coming off a manual digital camera where you have full control.The pre-set settings in this are incredible!  It even has a pre-set setting for PETS!  I shoved the camera in my spaztic cats face and as he was trying to get away, I had a clear and up close shot of his face (with FLASH!) Any other digital camera and it would have been fuzzy or non existant as the lag between shutter, flash, and actual photo would be greater than the cat's ability to dissapear within a second.  I did this more than once - super sharp and ultra fast!  Poor cat...There are baby-settings where you can give it a name and birthdate!  Probably so you can title your pictures automatically later - I don't know yet - but it's cool!Face detection - perfect!  4 faces in one shot I believe.  Also, the flash compensates to the distance to each face (multiple flashes) so if you're closer to one person, that person's face won't be washed out in light!  That's amazing technology!Enough tech - plenty more in there to play with - onto the video!I wanted a camcorder replacement so I don't buy another gadget just to take the few videos I DO want to take.  Something fast and easy to capture the moments as they arrive out of nowhere.  This camera's ability to take 1280x720 wide-screen videos to display on our flat-screen is what I was looking for.  I only give it 4 stars though - which is STILL such a feat!  The reason for a missing star is the camera's inability to focus fast enough on moving objects or while you're zooming.  I'm sure the motor tech will develop over subsequent cameras but for SUCH a small package to deliver such high resolution \"clips\" is truly a feat!  The maximum length of video at the highest resolution [tested] is 2GB [turned out to be 10:38 minutes].  Most videos won't need that much continuous shooting anyway so that's not a big deal.  The format is Quicktime's MOV.  I'll need to play around with transfering that to DVDs but looks great on the computer!  You can get the optional component cable that hooks directly onto the camera to the TV for instant enjoyment. (it comes with a VGA cable).  [I hooked up the camera to a 42\" HD Plasma via the AV cable and got a great resolution - better than a broadcast TV and JUST shy of HD sharpness - but I was up next to the screen so sitting back at the couch - doubt I could tell the difference.  The AV cable is mono with one video out so the sound only came out of the center channel speaker.  I'd give the sound 3-stars as there was a detectible background noise - I made sure to test it with little sound to decipher.  Sounds and voices came out clear - but it was not high fidelity by any means.  This is definately NOT a surround sound HD camcorder!  The camcorder \"clips\" however are phenomenal!]Oh, also, to download pictures from the camera to the computer?  NOTHING REQUIRED TO INSTALL!!!!  You plug the camera in the USB port, turn on the camera, choose PC on the camera (you can set it to always be that), and the computer recognizes it as a hard-drive from where you can drag and drop to your hearts content!This is NO DSLR where you have full control - but that's not what this is for.  So as you can tell, I highly recommend it and know it will be the perfect companion for pretty much all your photo-video needs in ONE tiny package (which travels VERY well!).[I am still working on posting samples - I'm sure others will beat me to the punch now that it's widely available and on sale]", "Date": "March 21, 2008"}, {"Title": "Nice upgrade over my TZ3", "Author": "D. Hentze", "ReviewID": "R1V0A4G7SC2MAI", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I received my TZ5 today, and so far I'm impressed. While some of the improvements over my TZ3 are minor, some are significant. Most people will enjoy the return of zooming ability while taking video, and the introduction of HD video. The TZ5's LCD screen is the nicest I've ever seen on a camera. I've taken several dozen test pictures under different circumstances, and the results were for the most part very good. Under perfect conditions, the results weren't much different than the TZ3. Under low light conditions, the Venus IV engine seems to do a little better with noise at ISO 400 and above. I wouldn't call it a dramatic improvement though. I'm going to do a little \"pixel peeping\" in the near future to see how the TZ5's small sensor handles the increase in megapixels. All in all, the TZ5 is just a great camera that is loaded with features. Is it a DSLR? No, but it's not supposed to be. If you already own a TZ3, you may want to weigh whether the TZ5 has enough new features and improvements. For myself, I'm happy with the upgrade, and will give my TZ3 to my wife.

I'm so happy with its performance and feature-set, I'm willing to forgive the lack of manual controls and the price drop I just saw.I pre-ordered and also bought a 16Gb SDHC card.  I plan on having this device replace my current Canon Powershot A75 and my Sony TRV-608 camcorder.  I can plan this way because... this camera shoots 720p high-definition video.  My big-screen LCD will really allow the captured video to shine.  In my preliminary tests on a 22\" LCD, the output is gorgeous, so much clearer and vibrant than the Hi-8 video I would shoot using the old Sony.It's a wonderful progression of technology.  My Sony camcorder can shoot in zero light, zooms to some ridiculous level, but I hardly ever use it because it's yet-another-device you need to carry.  My Canon worked well for three years, then decided to stop running.  I loved the manual controls and ability to bracket shots, but with 3x optical zoom, I was missing something.  Plus, it was a family camera, and The Wife could not care less about manual controls.The Lumix TZ5 is a perfect blend of features and performance for me.  It will allow me to grab high-definition camcorder video in the same device I can just hand to The Wife and say, \"Press the button\".  It has a removable Li-On battery with separate charger, so I can buy a spare and keep them charged and ready to travel.  It does a lot, for a fair price.I will miss the manual controls, especially for low-light shots, but in my testing I've already seen how well it can handle low-light with no flash.  Pictures look remarkable, shutter lag is less than the A75, and flash recharge is not too bad.  The LCD screen is huge compared to the A75, almost the size of a PDA screen.  That'll take some getting used to, especially since there's no optical viewfinder.  In all, I'm really happy with it, and would recommend it to anyone looking for a new point-and-shoot who needs the ability to grab quality video every now and then.

It's downfall was a tiny little LCD screen and a limited zoom range that ended at 35mm on the wide end. I wanted a camera that went down to at least 28mm and had a clear, large LCD. I looked at the Canon 870IS and the Nikon P-80 but settled on this. Why? The Canon's LCD was not as clear as the Lumix and it had a limited zoom range on the top end. And, to be honest, it didn't have some of the 'bells and whistles' that the Lumix did. The Nikon was really not pocketable and has been getting horrible reviews all over the internet since it's recent introduction (Amazon, DPReview.com, etc.). It seems that Nikon really knows how to do dSLR's but comes up way short in the P&S; category. I also briefly considered the Fuji 100SD but rejected it due to well known problems with pink banding and purple fringing. If you like to do a lot of low light, higher ISO photography though, the Fuji should be on your very short list.I know a number of people have complained that the TZ5 is 'not as small' as they thought/hoped it would be. C'mon guys, this thing has a 10x zoom that goes down to 28mm!!! Something with those capabilities is never going to be the size of a credit card! And the thing for me is that I just can't stand geometric distortion and the Panasonic/Leica is a real champ in this regard. There's nothing worse than that horrible barrel distortion you see in so many wide angle lenses. This one has none of that. The trade off is that it gets iffy at higher ISO's. You can effectively prevent this by setting the camera to never let the ISO get above, say 400. The camera allows you to do this. The Optical Image Stabilization (\"OIS\") is really superb as are the exposure options. And, of course, the face recognition is a great new development that Panasonic has implemented quite well in this camera.Now to it's video capabilities. It'll shoot 720p HD video in 16:9 which is awesome if you have a HD TV which is, of course, 16:9. Just be sure to turn off \"auto-focus\" when in video mode or the camera will constantly be 'hunting' for the right focus. It's depth of field is excellent so it'll be in focus most of the time anyway.Just a couple of nits. The low light assist lamp is not terribly effective (nowhere near as good as the one on my Sony DSC-V1) and the camera sometimes takes a second or two to find the right focus in low light. And I wish there was a way to more easily control/allow for long shutter exposures as I love night photography. As it is, you have to set the camera to \"Starry Night\" (one of the scene modes) to get shutter speeds longer than 1 second. Not that big a deal and  certainly a minor criticism of such an excellent overall camera.Oh, and one final thing...the build quality is superb. Everything about this camera just shrieks \"quality.\" Great job Panasonic. All at a price point of <$300.

James", "ReviewID": "R3P3P8P3NRNXA8", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I did research for about two months before deciding to purchase this camera.  I was originally going to buy the TZ3 for $249.99 and the day I was going to buy it I read an article that Panasonic was going to come out with the TZ5.I decided to wait a few weeks and read what I could regarding the quality of the new TZ5.  It took a few weeks but reviews started popping up online and I was able to see the features of the new camera verses the TZ3.  I decided to go ahead and spend the extra $50 dollars and purchase this camera.I am very pleased with the features of this camera.  I was looking for a small compact camera that was easy to use for my wife, but a large zoom for me.  Most point and shoot digital cameras have 3x or 4x zoom, this camera has a monster 10x zoom, which is great for my needs.  The camera stays relatively small so my wife can carry it around and with the Ai settings it makes it a very easy camera to use, which meets her needs.  I am also impressed with the photo quality of this camera.  There was one hang up though and I expected this so I knew what I was getting into - right out of the box I had to begin reading the instruction manual and adjusting the cameras settings to get the best picture quality.Pros.+ Small compact point and shoot with large 10x zoom+ HD video resolution (720p capture with component cable playback)+ Zoom while capturing video (option was not available in TZ3)+ Ai setting makes the camera easy for beginners, just turn it on and shoot.+ Large 3.0\" LCD display screen makes reviewing pictures easy (the TZ5 also has a higher resolution screen then the TZ3)+ 9.1 megapixel+ Able to take pictures in different aspect ratio's  4:3, 3:2, and 16:9Cons.- Picture review button has changed from the TZ3 model.  Now instead of easily hitting down on the 4 way directional pad you have to push a switch down to go into \"review mode\" to see the last picture you just took.  I found this a little slower than the TZ3 and one more moving part that can break.  For reference see the back of the TZ5 and notice the toggle switch from \"capture to review\" in the upper right hand corner.- If the camera is not set to Ai then taking a good picture straight out of the box might not be perfect.  You will want to spend a little time reading the manual and adjusting some settings to get a great photo.- Will only us SDHC memory cards.  Since I did not have a memory card this was not a problem for me, but if you are upgrading from an older camera you cannot use the old standard memory card.  The new SDHC cards are faster and it is suggested that you get a high speed card (transfer rate) in order to capture HD video.- ISO Images above 800 do have artifacts (static) in the image.  This does not make the photo horrible or bad looking just noticeable if you blow up the image to a large size such as an 8x10.  I knew this going in and most digital cameras have this problem, some worse.After owning this camera for over a month I am very pleased with it and couldn't be happier.  I hope this review helps and if you still need information or possibly some sample photos, then go to Google and type in \"review Panasonic TZ5\".

For several years my \"P&S;\" was a 2001 vintage Kodak ... very basic.I've got to say, as someone who loves to take photos and is pretty good at it, that this Lumix blows me away in how far \"P&S;\" technology has advanced in the past several years.

The most advanced auto mode I have ever used on a \"P&S;\".The HD video capability is nice. It's not going to give you videos of the quality you might expect from a dedicated vidcam, but this IS a \"P&S;\". Not having to carry around two separate cams is worth the trade-off in quality if you are just chronicling vacation stuff.Build quality is top flight and very sturdy. The viewing screen is brilliant. The images taken with this cam are very, very good.**Bottom line : a very high \"BUY\" recommendation for the Panasonic Lumix DMC-TZ5S.**", "Date": "May 29, 2008"}, {"Title": "An Awesome Camera with an Awesome Feature Set", "Author": "Patrick Stuart", "ReviewID": "RRI6TE868SJ12", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I have used this camera for about a week now and there is NOTHING I could really complain about.  The pictures come out super sharp with really accurate colors.  The stabilizer is really reliable, and the zoom is fast.  The screen is OUTSTANDING....haven't seen anything clearer.  I do like the quick zoom function, just press it and it maxes out the zoom for you.  The lens is really useful, and the fact that it's still small enough to fit in my jeans pocket makes it a real winner.There are tons of scenic modes that are cool but I haven't gone through many of them.  The face detection works like a champ, and the intelligent auto mode is the most smartest feature that could ever be put in a camera.  I hate when I have a stranger take a picture for me (like when I want to get in the picture with a group of people at a restaurant and I have our waitress take the shot) and the pic doesn't come out great.  I have to always change settings or scenic modes to get a good shot.  Here the camera does it for you.  The intelligent auto mode makes the camera a real POINT AND SHOOT for those who don't know how to use it.As others have mentioned the workmanship is solid, the camera feels really solid in your hand.  The camera is Made in Japan so you can't go wrong.  (I know some manufacturers start making stuff in Japan and later in the product's life they make it elsewhere, probably to still make a profit after price drops, so don't hold me to it if your's isn't made in Japan.)The issues that some bring up about noise in the photos I think are overly particular and picky.  If you aren't one of those kind, you gotta get this camera.  Go to various review sites to see sample photos, thats how I made up my mind.", "Date": "April 29, 2008"}, {"Title": "4.5 stars, great camera, see sample pictures uploaded.", "Author": "Crystal \"kavanava\"", "ReviewID": "R1839RGU6C8A4U", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I saw some pictures taken with the Sony DSC bridge camera and I thought the pictures, while good, weren't as crisp as I'd like so I decided to look at the Lumix cameras. Both Lumix cameras, the TZ5 and FZ18 (bridge model) Panasonic Lumix DMC-FZ18K 8.1MP Digital Camera with 18x Wide Angle MEGA Optical Image Stabilized Zoom (Black) are great.  I wanted a camera with more zoom than the 3x or 4x on most point & shoot cameras. I owned a Leica point & shoot when film was still the way to go and always loved the great pictures I got from that camera so the Leica lens was a great draw. You may have to use a tripod or monopod to steady your camera at full zoom to get a nice shot--if you don't care for this consider sticking with more MPs with less zoom and crop--you should be able to crop quite a bit and still get a decent shot. I don't recommend using full optical and digital zoom with any camera as the pictures get more \"grainy\", but if you have to get that tight shot you have that option.Pros for TZ5: Ready to go out of the box in iA (intelligent autofocus) mode--goes automatically from landscape to macro and mega OIS stabilization is very good. Has 10x zoom and can go to full zoom using optical & digital zoom (I believe this gives you 28x). Has an E.Zoom button that will take you to full optical and/or extended zoom using optical and digital zoom without having to use the zoom lever. Amazed at how well the macro mode worked and loved the options to switch to wider panorama type shots.  There are 2 other scene modes you can program & save with your preferences so you can quickly & easily shift to your pre-adjusted modes using the camera dial. Large LCD screen. Menus were relatively easy to learn and can easily switch to different camera options. Pictures were crisp and clean. You can also be creative using B&W;, sepia, and vivid and other camera options. Burst mode and bracketing options available. Small size you can fit in your purse or pocket. If you prefer to have some options but don't want to fuss a lot with a camera this is a great point & shoot camera.Cons for TZ5: The FZ18 shots at lower light had noise, but still not bad for a point & shoot and not a big issue unless you do a lot of low light shooting. You can also try high sensitivity and sport scene options to as well as focusing options to get better indoor or low light shots. Details in dark colored models were not as easily seen on LCD--I couldn't see the details clearly on some skinny red orchids and just pressed the shutter on faith--I still got some nice detailed shots. Also, autofocus didn't do as well on dark colored objects and in dim light. Pale yellow didn't photograph as well in iA--at least not close up--I had to step back to get better color rendition on a pale yellow hibiscus. LCD has clear, shiny \"window\" over it that helps brighten and sharpen the image, but gets \"fingerprinty\" and may scratch--I use a microfiber eyeglass cloth to keep it clean.I uploaded photos, mostly of flowers and plants I photographed in my yard so you can judge--the photos are un-retouched and not cropped. The day was bright & hazy, a breeze blowing so the flowers were not always sitting still. All were taken handheld. There is one handheld, indoors in dim light of my laptop screen.I have not used the video function so can't comment on it. I also haven't used all the scene options so I can't say if all work well. Backlight function worked pretty well.I notice the silver TZ5 camera is cheaper than the black for some reason--if you don't mind silver and want to save a few bucks, that may be the way to go.  I will leave some comments on the FZ18 for those that want some info on that camera.Verdict: A KEEPER. Much better than the previous Canon Power Shot I owned, which was slow and clunky.Thanks to everyone for posting their pictures and comments on Amazon, I appreciate the assistance and I hope I have been of some help to other consumers in return.", "Date": "May 17, 2008"}, {"Title": "This Camera is Grrrreat!", "Author": "deluxeczech", "ReviewID": "R3PHY839OU9TIY", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Firstly, be aware that this is a \"point-and-shoot\" camera.  I had read too many reviews where the only negatives were comparing it to digital SLRs.  I think there is some confusion that because it has a 10x zoom that it is a full-blow SLR.  Not so.  It is like any other compact digital in many of its functions.  It is only about 1/2 inch thicker than my Casio due to the lens, so it fits nicely in your palm, fanny pack, or pocket.Secondly, the 10x zoom is AWESOME.  Other features, like the image stabilizer, makes the Lumix TZ5 zoom even better (if that's possible).Also nice is the 28mm wide-angle Leica lens - quite a professional addition to a point-and-shoot.Other awesome features are the intelligent exposure, intelligent scene selector and burst shooting.Menu is easy to learn and use (we didn't even read the instructions).For a die-hard compact digital camera geek like myself, the pictures this camera produces look excellent.  Be assured, the color is MUCH sharper than in the examples above (perhaps due to compression by amazon).I had read that the battery door and tripod mount were plastic and flimsy for such a heavy-duty camera.  For sure, plastic seems like a cheap addition to such a sturdy camera.  But I haven't noticed either being flimsy. Of course, knowing they are plastic makes me handle them with a little more care.The LED screen is LARGE and automatically adjusts in brightness according to your environment.Another feature I appreciate (for a point-and-shoot) is the little rubberized ridge on the front right - just perfect for your fingers in taking quick one-handed shots.Lastly, if you want to see this camera in action, go to [...] and search on \"panasonic lumix tz5\".

IA combined with the new engine (V4) makes the camera work quite well for most picture taking situations. 4) The mode switch on the back, which switches between taking pictures to viewing pictures, is an excellent addition of a frequently used function to a dedicated button. It is duplicated on the little wheel, but you will always use the new switch. 5) The quick menu button - very handy for changing the most common settings. 6) The TZ5 has an improve menu structure on the amazingly clear screen. 7) I almost forgot, the TZ5 takes better sharper pictures than the TZ3, especially in low light situations without the flash.  By far, this is the best super zoom small pocket-size camera to buy. After writing the above review, I took this camera to China, where I took pictures under a wide variety of conditions. The 10x zoom was essential for the scenes, some of which were in the distance and others were fine detail 50 or 100 feet away. I took dim-light pictures of the Terra Cotta soldiers in a huge room where flash was useless. The results were sharp and well exposed even at 10x zoom.  Is this camera as good as an expensive single lens reflex camera? It was good, but not as good.  Then again, you cannot buy a 10x zoom SLR, and an SLR will not drop into your pocket while you are walking around. At least not my pockets.", "Date": "May 13, 2008"}, {"Title": "Very good, but some minor flaws that keep it from great", "Author": "Jonathon Groubert", "ReviewID": "R2ZWGGSARWA5AN", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I bought this camera a couple of months ago primarily because it was one of the very few still cameras that also recorded movies at 720p resolution.  (A couple more have been released since.)  My previous camera, a Fuji F700 had just died after a long and fruitful life and I was looking to upgrade.  This camera seemed to be just the ticket.  I wanted a camera with great stills, of course, but also good quality video, because I don't want to carry two pieces of equipment around.  This camera delivers on both ends.Let's start with the pros.  The pictures are very good, I don't see any problems with them.  The 3\" screen is very sharp and really nice.  The 10x zoom is terrific.  The camera is a nice comfortable size.Battery life is pretty amazing.  Although I bought two backup batteries, I find that I don't have to use them at all.  Also, the charger, with foldup electrical prongs, is tiny and does a great job recharging in 90 minutes or so.  Easy enough to throw the charger in the suitcase as well.The cons are not too bad, but annoying and simple to fix.  After shooting a still picture, the camera, of course, shows you a still of what you've just shot.  However, when you turn the camera sideways to shoot, say, a picture of the Eiffel Tower, the playback will flip the shot so that you don't have to turn the camera.  Why have that gorgeous 3\" screen if you're not going to use it?  I'll readily admit this is a minor annoyance, to be sure.  This is the default mode, and after some searching in the camera's memory, it can be changed to that the playback mode doesn't flip the picture.When shooting video, the camera's default is to have continuous focus.  Even if you're not moving the camera much, the camera will continue to go in and out of focus while shooting video, blurring everything.  This is more annoying than the picture flip I mentioned.  This is also correctable in the menu.The third annoyance is the camera's memory reading ability.  I have an 8 GB card, which is more than ample memory for anything.  In fact, the camera can shoot about 33 minutes of video on the highest-quality setting - 720p, 30 frames/sec.  However, when you go to shoot video, the camera only reads that there are 8 minutes and 30 seconds of video.  This is no big deal; however, after you shoot, say, 1 minute of video, and the counter counts down to 7 minutes and thirty seconds, then you press the shutter release again to stop recording, the reading changes right back to 8 minutes and 30 seconds, the maximum amount of memory recognizable by the camera.  This makes you think that the video didn't get saved.This thinking that the video didn't get saved is reinforced when you go to play it back, leading to my final annoyance, the camera's integration with my Panasonic Viera plasma TV.  I didn't buy a Panasonic camera for this purpose, but as long as I did, I figured, \"what the hey?\"  The TV has an SD slot in back, so you can take your memory card out of the camera and stick it directly into the TV and have a slide show of your pictures.  Sounds good, right?  But it doesn't play back video through the card slot.To play back the 720p video on the 720p plasma TV, you have to use cables, and connect it to one of the inputs.  The problem with this is that the cables provided aren't even composite cables - they're the standard red, white, and yellow - and this degrades the video quality.  This is just plain dumb, dumb, dumb.  The only way you can look at the video in all its HQ glory is on your computer.All in all, these are minor annoyances, I'll admit.  But they do keep me from giving the camera a 5-star rating.", "Date": "June 13, 2008"}, {"Title": "Dissapointing", "Author": "R. B.

A couple of friends had the TZ3, which peeked my interest.  However, I was ultimately dissapointed in its performance in low light situations and ISO over 200.  I had read that the TZ5 would prove superior in this regard, but it turns out only minimally so.I have spent the last two days putting the TZ5 through its paces and comparing it shot by shot with my Canon SD870.  The Canon blew it away time after time, especially in low light situations.  I was looking for a camera that would give me the same quality image as the Canon SD870, but also provide a more substantial zoom range in a small package.  The TZ5 fell short.  However, I don't know of any other compact camera outside the Lumix TZ line that offers anywhere near the zoom range, so it does benefit from occupying a very unique niche.My advice:  If you need the 28-280mm zoom lens, it's your only option.

Chung", "ReviewID": "R2GTCDX2TQLVRM", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I assume anyone who's reading this review already has looked at the specs, so I won't regurgitate them.  I did a lot of research and went through a couple of cameras (Fuji F100fd, Cannon SD770IS) before I settled on this one, and I'll explain why I settled on this one above the other two.  My main criteria were:1. Picture quality2. Low-light performance3. Speed (boot up, focus speed, etc.)I first bought the Fuji F100fd because of its low-light performance.  I found that although low-light performance was good, it wasn't as good as it was hyped up to be.  ISO 400+ pictures were a bit grainy -- much better than my previous Canon SD450, but not near as good as I had expected.  In decent light, the picture quality was superb, the best of any point-and-shoot I've used.  However, the killer was speed.  The focus and time-to-shoot was too slow, and by the time it actually took the picture the moment was gone most of the times.  So this wasn't working for me.Having owned two Canon Powershots before, I knew what I was getting when I swapped to a SD770-IS.  Overall it's a great camera, and takes very nice pictures, almost as nice as the F100fd.  The speed is superb, as expected. However, it does very poorly in low light, and you basically have to plan on using the flash all the time.  My camera also did poorly in bright light, most of the pictures in sunlight were over-saturated.  (The front panel of this particular camera was popping out a little, a manufacturing defect, which may have affected the light meter on the camera).  Given the issues in low and bright light and the front panel problem I decided I would try something else.I read reviews that the TZ5 pictures were noisy, so I was a little apprehensive about picture quality when I got the camera.  It's somewhat true, if you zoom 16X you'll see the pictures get a little grainy.  But after having some developed into prints, you can't tell at all on the prints.  This would only be a problem if you needed to blow the prints up into poster size.  So aside from being able to see grainyness when you blow the picture way up, the picture quality is really good.The TZ5 did much better than expected in low light - almost as good as the F100fd.  There is more noise than the F100fd, but the overall picture tone and sharpness are still excellent.I was very happy with the speed.  Almost as good as the Canons, much better than the Fuji.  So this was the keeper for me.There a lot of other things that I was very pleased with that I didn't consider before buying the camera.  I'm particularly pleased with its continuous shooting mode - you can take rapid continuous shots indefinitely at about 2 photos per second.  So if you're shooting kids, it's the perfect feature to make sure you catch that one split second smile.  The LCD is just beautiful, it puts my laptop lcd screen to shame.  It also allows you to quickly and easily change settings while in manual mode without having to navigate down a tree of menus.  And the image stabilization is excellent.There were also some things that were so-so.  It's pre-set white balance is mediocre, but using a custom white balance the pictures are excellent.  The face detection is ok, it doesn't work if the face is pointed a little sideways, or the face is partially obstructed.  The battery life is not bad, but not fantastic.  But since I don't use the flash much I've never run out of charge.The video is pretty good, but it has its set of flaws.  Although it records in 720p resolution, the quality is not as sharp as you would expect from a 720p movie.  It looks equivalent a 480i video (in sharpness) from a good camcorder, so it's about as good as a decent 480i camcorder.  It records in motion jpeg (quicktime .mov container), which means the video files are much larger than they would be using mp2, mp4, or h.264, and only devices that play quicktime will be able to play it right off the camera.  The microphone isn't very good, so make sure you're close to the subject matter.  The zoom using video is very slow, and the focus is slow (goes in and out) for a few seconds whenever the zoom changes.  All that being said, it's great to have video recording - the convenience of having it my camera resulted in me not using our sony camcorder since I got the TZ5.  I end up taking more video and photos now.The one real issue with the camera is that it doesn't take good pictures when there is a bright background.  With the Canon and Fuji, I would simply use the flash to make sure I didn't end up with a silhouette.  And they both did a great job illuminating the subject matter at an appropriate light level.  The TZ5 does a really poor job with this.  You still end up with under-illuminated subject matter.  I've tried a bunch of different settings and still have the issue, which is a real shame.But overall, I'm very pleased with the camera.  It's probably the best point-and-shoot that approximates the functionality of a DSLR.

The photos that you'll see are all taken in the easy mode, which is called \"IA\" for Intelligent Auto, and they were all taken without flash - even the one inside the screened porch.What I love most about this camera is it's ability to keep the subject in focus, even when the subject and/or the photographer is moving!  I shot a butterfly fluttering around, with the zoom (in IA mode) and it came out perfectly in focus.  The photo of the horse & buggy was also taken effortlessly in IA mode with the zoom.  Photos from the airplane, perfect, even took a few from the moving car and there was no blur (not in the samples)!  Amazing.  Colors are bright and clear, and you can choose how vivid you want them to be.  These photos were taken in \"standard\" color, incidentally.  It picked up all the hues of the sunrise in the harbor and sunset on the beach.The zoom works beautifully, very smooth and quiet.  Again, automatic focus in zoom (and otherwise) is the best I've seen in any camera of this size and price range.I love the wide angle lens.  It captures so much more than I'm used to and gives a really nice, almost dimensional look to the photos.The battery life is pretty good until you use the movie mode, and that does take a lot out of it.  It's a good idea to have an extra one ready just in case.The ergonomics are excellent, easy to shoot with one hand, and easy to navigate the menu.The LCD screen, as you know, is one of the best out there.  It works well in sunlight, and if the day is very bright, you can adjust the contrast and make the screen darker if needed.  Beautiful resolution when playing back your photos on the LCD screen!The movie feature is also quite good FOR A DIGITAL PHOTO CAMERA.  The zoom is slow (which it states in the manual), but the pictures are clear.  HD mode does take a lot of memory and battery obviously, but it's a great feature to have.  I shot some whales from the shore with zoom at 10x and they came out pretty well even though they were quite far away (contact me if you'd like to see that video).  I took the movie of Frisky indoors in the evening with the regular lighting in the home and it I think it looks very good.In conclusion, I highly recommend the Panasonic DMC-TZ5.  It is not a digital SLR, but has many of the features without the bulk or the price, so it's great for travel.

I wanted a camera that was lightweight and pocketable - two words that I would not use to describe my Canon G9. I wanted image quality that was good enough \"as is\" - clear detail and accurate color without requiring me to fix it. I was not concerned with lots of manual control - I have my G9 in my bag (but not my pocket).I was not especially impressed with the TZ5 when I played with it at the local Best Buy, but I attributed that to the floor model being pretty beat up.

Indoor pictures were very yellow with the TZ5 - none of the white balance settings yielded good results. Outdoors, the TZ5 tended to wash out images and lose fine detail. In automatic mode, the Canon consistently turned out better pictures (in my opinion) than the Panasonic.In the end, I'm going to return the TZ5 and get an SD880 IS.

This review is based upon 6 MONTHS of use.I wanted more than the 3X from conventional compact digital cameras.  After traveling to places such as India, Portugal, and Cancun, for example, 3X is not versatile enough to capture some of the landscapes, landmarks and distant subjects that I wanted to capture.To be honest, resolution was not a factor in purchasing a camera but with 9.1 Megapixels, this camera was more than adequate for my purposes since I only print 4x6\" photographs.OPERATION:This camera is great as a point and shoot camera.  Shutter lag is reasonable for a camera of this class, unlike others I experimented with before buying this one.FEATURESBattery life indicator:  You may take this feature for granted but my prior camera (Canon Digital Elph), did not have a battery life indicator.  When traveling, battery life is a very important factor so that you don't miss shots.  I bought 2 spare batteries with my camera.The 27 megabytes of internal memory is inadequate for any practical purpose allowing for only about 8-10 photos at high resolution or a few seconds of video.This camera has a user friendly menu system that is easy to navigate given the 4 directional buttons and central menu/enter button.  There are two scene modes, Intelligent automatic mode, movie mode, clipboard mode and custom mode.  A quick menu button is great for on-the-fly adjustments.The intelligent auto-mode is where I keep the camera, for a majority of photographs keeping the operation simple - this is the point and shoot mode for a majority of casual users, like myself.  On this mode, picture size (9 MP, 5MP, 3MP and 0.3 MP), aspect ratio (4:3, 3:2, and 16:9), burst mode,  and color mode (standard, natural, vivid, black/white and sepia), can be toggled in the menu.The custom mode allows me to change other factors such as ISO, continuous auto focus, metering mode, white balance, audio recording, and intelligent exposure, to name a few.The glass LCD has various modes to allow you to see the settings, a 9 segmented partition and no data.  I like seeing a histogram in real time to determine the color range of the photograph.The auto-focus mode has face detection, 3 area high speed, 1 area high speed, spot, 1 area, and 9 area.  I personally keep it in face detection unless I am taking a photo of a landmark or other outdoor subject.Movie mode is versatile and I use this as a back up camcorder for times when I want to take a quick video.  However, due to the small microphone, the sound quality is not optimal for say, a piano recital or speech where sound is essential.  The picture quality is excellent.  The aspect ratio (4:3, 16:9), picture mode (30 fps/16:9 high or low quality 15 fps/16:9 high or low quality), white balance, metering mode and auto-focus mode can be adjusted.QUALITYPicture quality is excellent for the purposes of casual use (i.e. parties, performances, events, stills, pets, children, outdoors.  Zoom photographs is limited by low light given the built in flash.Movie mode is a versatile feature since it records in high definition 720p.  The video format is in Quicktime mode.  Image quality is limited by low light.CONSTRUCTION:The body is made of metal and has a nice heavier weight that allows me to hold it steady.  The textured grip in the front allows me to operate the camera one handed.A toggle switch allows the user to take photos or view the photos.  This is a convenient and well thought out feature since cumbersome menus (or even multifunctioned buttons) on other cameras make this reviewer/user confused.  This camera, once you understand what button to use doesn't require the user/operator to have to look at all of the buttons to operate it.There are 3 output ports, including AV out/digital, component out and DC in.  The battery cover is easy to open and close.  The small Lithium battery and SD card fit in the same compartment.  In the past 6 months of heavy use, I have not had problems with getting the battery or card out.There is an eccentrically placed port to allow mounting on a tripod.  The location is not useful for handheld tripods but works for conventional full featured tripods.PROSImage quality10X zoom for a compact camera720p HD quality moviesSolid constructionVivid glass LCD screenMenu system and 5 button navigationExcellent battery lifeBattery life indicatorCONSPoor sound quality with videoLow light limitations with zoom and videoWheel selection feature turns 360 degrees (needs to be 'locked' to operate)Slightly heavier than its compact counterpartsRECOMMENDATIONS:If you want to use this camera for HD video, I highly recommend SDHC memory cards.

In addition, the motion picture capture also worked well.", "Date": "November 23, 2008"}, {"Title": "Simply put, an outstanding camera!", "Author": "ken in the city", "ReviewID": "R1YE62TYG66CJG", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I wanted to get a camera that was closer to a DLSR in quality and features, but that wasn't bulky.  I wanted to get a camera that I could not only use casually at home and around town, but also on vacation where I tend to take a greater variety of camera shots.  The TZ5 checked all the boxes and then some!Other reviews compare it to the Canon sd870is and other cameras so I won't go into that here.  Here's how I see it:Pros:- The lens and 10x optical zoom.  Simply fantastic.  I know, you may think you don't need the zoom.  And I agree, for the most part, you probably don't.  I'm certainly no professional photographer, but I thought about it, and those occassions when I do need more than your standard 3-4x zoom actually comes up more often than I would have thought - whether video taping an at bat for a baseball game or taking a close up photo from a moderate distance.  And since I bought it, I have wound up using the zoom far more than I would have expected.  Particularly in the 5-8x range for a variety of shots.  This is key since many other comparable cameras only have zoom up to 4x.-  The wide angle!  This is my first wide angle camera and boy does it make a difference from your standard point and shoot!  I won't go back.  It's more than just getting more into a shot, in many cases, its the difference between getting a shot framed properly or not. Getting the whole background or building or whatever into the shot or not.- Pre-set camera modes are great.  The TZ5 has 15+ pre-set camera modes that really are great for different environments.  What's even better is that you can set two of those modes into the dial at top for quick access.  This way, you don't have to keep adjusting the mode for each shot.  For instance, at night, I pre-set the dial at top to \"candle light\" and \"night portrait\" and can quickly take shots that way.-  Great picture quality. I've read various commentary on the superiority of the Canon picture.  I haven't done side by side comparisons but what I can say is that I've taken a lot of photos and am very satisfied.  And anyways, I'm skeptical of some of these side by side comparisons on photo quality.  So much of a photo is the setting, light, etc that you shouldn't be using the \"standard auto setting\" to get the best picture regardless.  I doubt those comparisons adjusted each camera appropriately for each shot.-  Crisp, large 3\" LCD screen.  This is one of the primary differences between the TZ4 (comes with 2.5\" screen) and TZ5.-  Long exposure shots are really, really cool.  This camera takes amazing low light, night time shots.  The exposure is 15 or 30 seconds but literally (if you don't move for that long), you can get AMAZING night time shots without a flash and with really cool light effects.-  Very cool \"burst shooting\".  This is indespensible for action or fast moving shots.  You can do normal burst shooting of any camera setting at about 2.5-3 pics/second and you can do it continuously!  You can also do a high-burst at 6 pics/second at 2 megapixel quality.  I got great shots diving off a boat in mid-air with this.-  For the lens and quality it's relatively compact.  While its bigger than your standard compact point and shoot, its still small enough to fit in your pocket.  Its about the size of an old school ipod, though thicker, and its way better than slugging around a DSLR.  And the design is ergonomic.And now some Cons:-  HD video recording.  The quality of the HD picture on playback is great.  But there are two shortcomings with this feature. 1) Sound quality is as you would expect for a camera. So its sort of like HD picture/low tech camera sound.  It won't replace your HD camcorder, but its certainly good enough for casual recordings. 2) Takes up a ton of memory.  I got a 16GB card and that will record about 30min of HD video.  Not a lot if you want to take a lot of pics as well on a vaca.  I just wind up taking normal non-HD videos, which works fine.-  Auto zoom on video recording is annoying.  You need to turn the feature off when taking video, otherwise your video will be in and out of focus as you zoom.  But the ability to zoom WHILE taking video is a differentiator for this camera vs. others.  Also, some of the features still a work in progress.  For instance, the auto face detect works some times, but not others.-  There are not many manual adjustments you can make- primarily shutter speed/exposure and other standard features common in most point and shoot cameras.  Obviously I wouldn't expect this to be as flexible as a DLSR, but just something to keep in mind.-  Camera has two automated picture shot modes (where it takes a picture by itself) and the delay is either 2 or 10 seconds.  I use this mode a lot - this way everyone can get into a pic!  I wish they had longer delay time and more lead up warning to when the picture is going to be taken.In summary, I would highly recommend this camera for anyone who wants the ability to take a wide variety of high quality pics but doesn't want to lug around a big camera.  The cons are far outweighed by the pros.  Don't hesitate - you will love this camera!", "Date": "August 15, 2008"}, {"Title": "The RIGHT one after 7 months research.

I like to be sure that I get the most for my money when I make a purchase.I outline exactly what I want and what I expect from my purchase BEFORE I start shopping.I spent 7 months reading, comparing and researching all similar Ulta Compact and Compact camerasbefore I made my choice. I would have been even happier if this camera had 10 Megapixels instead of 9.1 ...only so it matched others that I was comparing (I compared 12's too, pics generally were NOT as good).Frankly, I am extremely happy with the fabulous pics this camera produces.I FIRST thought that I wish it were \"a little smaller\" - now I am very happy that it is not.If it were much smaller I don't believe it would be as easy and comfortable to use.Yes!. I handled nearly a dozen of its competitors, as well.I read every review (Pro and Users) I could find anywhere (online, magazines, trade journals).Be carefull with some of them. I put a lot of \"weight\" in reviews by the Pros,HOWEVER I found that many of the things they said about this camera were not true.Some of their comments caused me to \"pause\" and almost not buy this camera.Some talked about features they wish this camera had, that others did have ...only I found that SEVERAL such features ARE present in this camera.Some features that they reviewed as a \"Negative\", after learning how to use them turn out to be a great \"POSITIVE\".The ZOOM is very sharp and the Wide angle really helps me get shots that would NOT be possible with other \"similar\" cameras! You won't need the flash as much as with other cameras.The camera can adjust the ISO (as well as many other settings, in \"IA\" mode)to give you great shots when you can't use a flash (and you can set it to 6400 ISO for very dim non-flash shots).I was happy with my long-arrived-at choice the day I bought it.If I knew THEN what I know NOW ... I would have bought it much sooner!I enjoy it more everyday! I planned to use my \"PRO Camera\" (a $2500.00 Olympus system - 18 months of research) for \"all the things that this camera would not be able to do\" ...NOW I know that this Panasonic will do a fine job for 90 to 95% of all the camera tasks that I want to do!AND it is much much smaller and lighter!I find I am using my Pansonic more and more everyday!.I do suggest you get a couple of 1300 Mah batteriesand a couple of 8 Gig (or larger) LEXAR (Yes, the brand matters - they are much faster 20 Mb/sec) SDHC cardsif you plan to do lots of serious picture taking as I do.This camera has an excellent battery life compared to others,but I take LOTS of PICS and videos and need the extra batteries.You can stop looking now. You WILL enjoy this camera!(By the way MROCK makes a perfect case for it and a spare battery and spare memory card,I am now looking for a very small case, when I want to take just the camera in a pocket).Have FUN with it!UPDATE:I have used this camera for a very long time now! It is STILL an excellent performer!I have added larger SDHC cards to the ones I started with (that STILL WORK FINE).I will be bringing THIS CAMERA OUTFIT on our trip To \"The Holy Land\" from Jerusalem to Rome.During that 17 day trip I will take thousands of pictures!It will be GREAT! I hope you will enjoy this camera too!{Did my review help you decide?}", "Date": "July 26, 2008"}, {"Title": "Great point & shoot camera, best for the money", "Author": "A. Tubesing", "ReviewID": "R3DKAN8AWEWZ1K", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "4.5 stars.  After about a thousand shots I have found that this camera has really held up to my expectations.  It takes great photos, it's easy to convince the camera what you want it to do, and focusing is a breeze compared to most P&S; cameras I've owned and tried lately.  And the screen on the back is nothing short of utterly beautiful--high resolution and large size make for easy picture taking and reviewing.Performance:I get good sharp photos on at least 80% of attempts (and I rarely use flash so that's quite something considering some of the conditions I shoot in). I typically use the Auto mode (dial selection with the red camera icon) and move the camera around to lock the exposure with a half-press of the shutter button.  For nine out of ten tourist shots this works great, and it is pretty good in macro mode as well.  It's sometimes difficult to convince it to use a faster shutter speed without using one of the other (virtually indecipherable) scene modes.  I really wish I could specify a minimum shutter speed so I could guarantee an un-blurred shot.As for the special scene modes, unless you need something in there that you can't set yourself, I suggest ignoring these unless you want to memorize a ridiculous array of special conditions for each mode.  The complexity of what it enables and disables in each mode is ludicrous, there are even modes that limit the image size selection for no apparent reason. For example, in Intellegent Auto mode you can use any size except 7 MP... Whatever.User Interface:The user interface on this camera is second to none, extremely convenient access to most settings, and very easy to use.  This one has even figured out how to put the red-eye flash settings in the same place as the other flash settings (why everybody doesn't do that I can't imagine). I NEVER find myself fumbling around trying to find a setting, almost everything I need regularly is a one-button toggle, or an easy quick-menu accessible with a single button press.  One downside is that the mode dial selector is easy to accidentally move while pocketing the camera so if you're not paying attention you may likely shoot some pics in an unintended mode (this is perhaps the most significant problem I've had with this camera).  One really nice thing about this camera is that the power switch is an actual switch and no other buttons or actions will turn on any function of the camera.  This means it doesn't turn on accidentally in your pocket and waste batteries or extend the lens unnecessarily (a flaw that has Canon owners ruining lens motors at an alarming rate).Optics:While I was wishing they'd focused their efforts on a wider aperture lens (for more light gathering capability) rather than the super wide and super zoom features, I must say the optical range of this camera is incredible.  I took a four day trip to NYC and I was never left wanting for wider angle shots or more telephoto.  I took everything from cityscapes and zoomed pics of building tops to self portraits and wide macro close-ups, there was so much flexibility--more than any lens I've ever owned (SLR included).  The macro works great too, and can focus on subjects amazingly close, you can get a full-frame picture of a quarter from a half inch away.  I snapped a shot of a flower's innards and didn't even realize until I got home that I'd also captured a caterpillar buried deep within the folds of the flower's petals.  Incredible.  One downside to the super-wide aspect though, you'll notice a significant distortion around the edges where the fisheye effect is quite apparent, especially in city-scapes with parallel buildings that appear to tilt toward each other.  I was able to correct this somewhat by not zooming to the fully-wide setting.Battery:Battery life seems to be quite good.  On first charge I shot over 300 pics and the battery indicator still read full.  I was afraid that it would suddenly decline leaving me with little warning, but 300 pics is pretty good anyway.  Now, after a four-day vacation snapping upwards of 250 photos a day, the longest day concluded with one of three battery bars depleted, two bars remaining.  If that's a reasonable estimation of remaining power then I am suitably impressed.  For reference, I use stabilizer mode 2 (on all the time), continuous focus mode OFF, and flash on maybe 5% of my pictures.  I also turn it off between shots if it's going to be a minute or more.One note for new buyers:  The battery does not come pre-charged, so be prepared to spend two hours reading the manual while your battery charges before you can use the camera.  Sorry folks, you can't bring it home from the store and start using it right away--but it does charge quickly.The best thing about the battery though is the tiny little travel charger that comes with it--no clumsy cords, just a very compact block (smaller than a deck of cards and just a tad thicker) with flip-out prongs that plugs into the wall with the battery snapped in.  It easily fits unnoticed in my travel kit.*** A few significant details you may not see elsewhere: ***1.  Since image quality drops off quickly at ISO settings over 200 I was glad to find that it had a way to specify a max ISO in the auto ISO mode, but unfortunately the lowest option is 400, which it chooses for nearly all indoor shots.  Also, some modes ignore this setting so even though you may think you'll always be under 400, you won't in certain scene modes.  For example, many of the shots I took in 'sport' scene mode from a moving boat were shot at 800 despite having set the max to 400.  This ISO limit appears to only apply to automatic mode (the dial setting with the red camera icon).  Further hindering ISO control is the fact that it does not tell you what ISO your picture will be taken at, even after exposure lock with a half-press, even with maximum display info selected.  It will show you the chosen aperture and shutter speed, but it doesn't reveal ISO until after the picture is taken.2.  I can not understand why they do this in the first place, and it's even more frustrating to not be able to turn it off or choose some options in this 'feature':  This camera subdivides your photos into separate folders of pictures and as far as I can tell there's no way around it.  If you don't ever mess around with the files on the card, it will take 999 pictures per folder.  This is not a huge deal if your average outing/vacation is less than 999 pictures, but with today's unlimited file name length I would really rather keep sequentially counting file numbers limitlessly, and not use folders to break them up.  I can not imagine why they think everyone would want this (or anyone for that matter). I could almost understand if they separated them by date or some other criterion.  With other cameras I have always just had them all in the same folder, that way I don't have to go switching around looking for the photos, they're all in the same place.3. Amazon's price on this camera fluctuates on a daily basis, both up and down.  Since I started looking last week the price started at $270, went up to $296, and is now back to $284.  I have no idea why, but if today's price is closer to $300 you might consider waiting a day or two to see if it gets better.Those are the main points I wanted to share at the moment.  I may be back with more info after a few thousand shots.A brief background on my purchase... I initially started this quest to find the most compact camera with the most SLR-style features I could get.  The natural choice for that pursuit is the Canon G9 which was the front runner until I played with this TZ5.  It handled simple point & shoot operations so much better than the canon while inside the store that I was swayed to consider this Panasonic more seriously.  The downside is that it offers virtually no SLR-like features.  My first priority was to get a portable, pocketable camera, which both of these models fit, but the panasonic moreso.  I wanted good point-and-shoot performance with the option to get more creative when I want.  Since embracing the digital revolution eight years ago I haven't even touched my film SLR again, not once.  But I miss the manual control so much.  In the end this Panasonic P&S; won me over, I think the Canon is not quite there yet to be what I want for manual control.  It's a little clumsier in terms of user interface, and it's gone after way too many megapixels at the cost of low light capability.In short, this Panasonic is a great camera, I would buy it again in a second.", "Date": "July 23, 2008"}, {"Title": "Awesome Point & Shoot Camera !!!", "Author": "REPOMAN \"Repoman\"", "ReviewID": "R1FC9K1Z7TRM5Y", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I must say that I am very satisfied with my purchase of the TZ5.

Once I had the Panasonic in my hand, I instantly felt something different. Without experimenting with it, the outside & overall look of it had true sense of craftmanship. It really isn't that big for a Point & shoort & it has a nice, solid feel to it. The more I played with it, the more impressed I became. I absolutely love the fact that you can take multiple shots by simply holding down the shoot button. Great if you have a young baby or small children. It's not exactly an SLR but for a digital point & shoot, I think it works great. The pictures come out great & the 3inch screen is crystal clear.

The color is pretty bright and the resolution is worth the price of admission. Another downside is the seeming cap of 8min 37 seconds for each continuous video clip even though I have an 8GB card in there - not a biggie since long clips get pretty boring but you can't shoot a basketball game with this camera.A hidden surprise was the intelligent autoexposure (iA) mode. It actually works really well. I've futzed with Canons P&S; cameras in the past to get fill flash and other ways to get a decent shot - but iA mode does all that for you and the shots come out very well with no tiny menu surfing - big win.

I've been using digital cameras for a long time, and in the past have stuck with another brand (which I won't name because I don't want to convey that they're inferior - they're also very good, just not like this one, and may well be ideal for someone else). I got the DMC-TZ5 last month, shot a few images around campus, then took it off to San Francisco for a week.To put it simply, I am blown away by the handling and image quality. You can read elsewhere about the outstanding Leica lens, the good build quality and materials, and I haven't taken it apart or put it on the test bench so I won't add to that discussion. But I'm a pretty demanding photographer, and this camera makes me very happy.I took street grab shots all over the city and found the camera very responsive. The LCD worked fine for me in all lighting conditions, and I found it quite easy to compose and shoot. The most needed controls are easily accessible - white balance, exposure compensation, picture modes - and the menus and default settings are easy to work with to get the camera configured just the way you want. The ability to select different color profiles is especially nice. The grip and general configuration work well - I have fairly large hands and have no problem with this relatively small camera. The lens does take a moment to crank out or in when you turn the camera on or off but that's to be expected with a 10X zoom.Flash photos worked fine, although like any small camera the flash reach is limited, but where it really blew me away was in taking image-stabilized low-light photos. I shot nighttime street scenes, lit by store signs and street lights only, and the images are sharp and crisp at ISO 800. No, I haven't printed them, but looking onscreen at full resolution they're better than any others I've seen. I'm sure one can get better from a D-SLR but I'm not willing to carry around that much camera equipment anymore - I want a camera that will always be with me and can still take excellent photos, and this fits the bill better than I had imagined.I haven't used the video function so can't speak to that. Image uploading isn't exactly fast but I think that's a function of the high resolution and corresponding large files rather than some kind of electronic limitation. I like the blue color finish on the body even.I see surprisingly little barrel distortion at the wide end of the zoom, and being able to go from 28-280mm equivalent is wonderful. And at the long end the image stabilization really does work. Well.

I am not disappointed after using it for a month. I had been very satisfied with my tiny Canon Elph cameras over the years, but wanted something that would give me 16:9 wide screen capability and better quality video. I find I am using video more and more and really enjoy making short DVDs (using Apple iMovie) after a trip or event. I incorporate still pictures and video (movies) in the DVDs.As an example, I recently attended a music concert featuring (among others) my grandson. The performance was in a poorly lit auditorium, so the low light capabilities were tested. My son was also shooting video using his Sony Handycam (several years old, mini-DV), so I had an opportunity to compare. I was very pleased with the video quality (shooting in hi-def) and my camera clearly outperformed his. One feature I really appreciated was the ability to view the video on the camera's display and take \"snapshots\" of specific frames from the video which can be done at any time. This is the best way to get just the right still picture (my grandson is a drummer, so it is important to capture facial expression, hand position, relationship to other performers, etc). I absolutely love this feature and used it extensively.  The biggest problem (as many others have mentioned) is sound quality; the sound is OK if you are just shooting a couple of people talking in a quiet room, but was terrible in the concert/auditorium setting. For sound, my son's Handycam definitely outperformed the TZ5. Fortunately, I was able to use his soundtrack along with my video in making the DVD.Recording video in Hi-Def with this camera gives a better result than using the non-Hi-Def widescreen option (I tested it both ways), even if you don't ultimately use the Hi-Def when making a DVD (I don't). I bought an 8GB Sandisk SDHC Extreme III memory card and used the included card reader (you need a special card reader for SDHC) to import the videos into my iMac. It was a simple process, and iMovie treated the Hi-Def video like any other import, no special formatting needed. I assume it would be just as simple on a PC using most current editing software. Recording in HD limits the length of a single continuous clip to about 8 1/2 minutes; this is not a problem for me, but could be in some situations. Memory size is the only limit to how many such clips you can shoot consecutively.I have considered getting a separate sound recorder to use along with the camera (there are some very good portable digital audio recorders out there), but decided that would be too much trouble and defeat the purpose of an easy-to-use camera. So, I will just learn to live with the sound limitations (I rarely shoot performances; mostly just friends and family or travel shots).I have been pleased with the still photo quality; it is as good as the Canon Elphs. I love the 16:9 format. This camera has a variety of adjustment options which I have not tried yet, and is easy to use and hold. Many adjustments (e.g., exposure compensation, various focus options, zoom) are also available in the movie mode.The TZ5 is  a beautiful piece of equipment, and feels solid and well made. One caveat, though: it is easy to accidentally block the microphone while holding the camera, and doing so makes the marginal sound unusable, so I have to train myself how to hold the camera.Before I bought this camera, I considered buying one of the new AVCHD video cameras (such as Canon HF10 or Sony SR12) but chose the TZ5 because of its portability, flexibility, still photo capability, and price. I think the cameras of the future will combine high quality video/sound and high quality still photo capability (and portability), and today the TZ5 is the best compromise.

Austin", "ReviewID": "R16AN18JOQNP8V", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I'm very happy with this camera. My goal was to have a camera that would take nice still photos, along with decent video. It has been everything I expected based on other professional reviews I had read.For me, there was a small learning curve to get the video focused the way I wanted. I've learned to frame the shot, focus, and then shoot video, without the continuous focus running. Because the video is 720p, and the camera is so small compared to a camcorder, handheld video is more likely to be a little shaky. I've learned to be a little more diligent about the way I hold the camera, and I also take advantage of the Image Stabilization feature. Compared to the video from my last mini-dv camcorder, the video is beautiful. For home videos, it is more than adequate. The audio is lower quality, which I expected based on other reviews, but I can hear people's voices and understand what they are saying, so I am fine with it.The photos are great for a point-and-shoot. I would definitely recommend following other peoples' advice I've read, which is to keep the INTELLIGENT-ISO mode at a max of 800 to help reduce the \"grainy\" look. There are a LOT of features, and I haven't learned them all yet. But for the amateur photographer, it would appear that there are numerous options to help you get a great picture.I've taken this camera on a couple of one-day trips, and it has been wonderful. Having one relatively small camera that is capable of shooting great photos and video is one of the best accessories a father of three could have. I've not had any battery issues yet. I like having a rechargeable Lithium-ion  battery. I just charge it up the night before any event, and it always gets me through the next day.Some more notes about the video as a semi-professional videographer:A great thing for me has been that the video is in a QuickTime format that is native to my Mac (Motion JPEG). I have been able to create a preset in Final Cut Pro that allows me to work with the video in it's native format, without any transcoding. To me, that's a big plus compared to using some of the other HD camcorders out there. Something that needs to be considered, though, is that you need plenty of hard-drive space to store these videos. I bought an A-DATA 16GB Turbo SDHC Class 6 Memory Card here on Amazon to use in this camera. I was a little leery considering it only cost $30 bucks, but it has worked fine so far. Again, I took another person's advice, and I've left the card in the camera ever since I put it in. I only transfer the photos and video by plugging the camera into the computer. I figure I don't want to mess with the physical integrity of the memory card any more than I have to. Playback of the video is also something that needs to be considered. You can plug the camera into a standard TV for standard resolution playback, or you can buy an extra Component Cable, which I'm sure would yield better results for playback on an HDTV. However, when you take the files off of your memory card, you'll need to have another playback option. Personally, I plan on using a Mac Mini, with the built-in Front Row software, connected to an HDTV for my future viewing. But for now, the only way to watch my home video in full HD is on my laptop.Overall, I think another reviewer here put it best when he wrote, \"If you know what you're getting into, you'll be thrilled.\" It's a great option for a very portable, high quality still-photo and video camera... possibly the best in its category so far.", "Date": "November 22, 2008"}, {"Title": "Lumix DMC-TZ5K", "Author": "Frederick W.

Though I haven't tried all its features yet, I know I made the right choice. It is perfect for casual photography, since this particular Lumix gives accurate colors and offers lots of simple ways to adjust light, color, focus, shutter speed, and more. The 10x zoom is also a big plus, along with the large, bright viewing screen, which provides all the technical information you could need to take decent photos. In addition to all this, it takes pretty decent movies, including HD, widescreen format. Be aware, though, that those who plan to shoot lots of HD movies will need to buy an 8GB or 16GB SDHC card (preferably class 6). For those content with normal movie setting, a 4GB card will be sufficient. If you are considering the less-expensive Lumix DMC-TZ4K, the small additional cost (on Amazon, at least) for the TZ5K is money well spent, considering the differences in the two cameras. For my money, the larger LCD screen alone seals the deal.... A note to the few who have complained about audio quality in movies: First, Panasonic placed the microphone on the top left, which is less than ideal; one has to be careful not to cover it with the left index finger. Second, a high-quality, professional microphone is more than one should expect, as it would significantly increase the price of the camera, as well as its size.

I decided to wait a while before writing a review until we had a chance to use it in every possible situation in order to arrive at a useful conclusion for this review.  I consider myself an advanced amateur photographer, and I shoot with my Nikon DSLR most of the time, but I have to say that the Lumix TZ5 is one of the finest point and shoot digicams I have ever had the pleasure of using.  In some cases, it even out performs my Nikon D80.  Though I will not be trading in my D80 any time soon, this camera can hang with the best of them, if you are concerned with image quality.  Just take a look at all of the sample shots on the product page, if you need convincing.So, now on to my review.Image quality -I have found the image quality to be above average outdoors under bright, sun-lit conditions as well as overcast conditions, handling exposure perfectly while in the intelligent auto mode.  Up to ISO 200, the images are very crisp and clean, with almost zero hint of noise, even in the shadows.  But as with most point and shoot digital cameras these days, it begins to suffer from the most annoying type of noise (chroma), beyond ISO 400, even outdoors.  Shooting indoors, without flash, over ISO 400 and you almost shouldn't bother, if you're looking for super crisp images.  However, it does provide images that are quite usable in many of the trick scene modes.  Also indoors, shooting in mixed light, I have found that the TZ5 has trouble chosing the correct white balance while in intelligent auto mode.  I found myself changing the preset on my own to suit the conditions.  This is fine for people who know what white balance is, but not so for those like my wife, for whom this particular camera was intended.  And it really suffers under incandescent (or halogen) lighting, tending more toward a very unattractive orange cast.  But believe it or not, while shooting in intelligent auto mode, if you take several frames under such light, the camera will begin to \"figure it out\" and you may get one good frame out of perhaps three or four.  I thought that to be as good as I've seen in a digital camera (my nikon included).  It tends to hunt for focus indoors a lot, rendering the face detection auto-focus somewhat useless as it will find it very hard to find my 7 year old's face 5 feet from the lens, despite the AF assist lamp.  But outdoors, it's right on the money.Resolution -The 9.1 megapixels of this camera has plenty resolution for 8x12\" prints at 300 dpi, which is how I determine the usefulness of the number of pixels it has.  At half the resolution, it will produce a print much larger with enough quality given a lack of noise, so if you take a shot outdoors, using a low ISO, you can expect VERY nice prints from this camera.  Some of the new models of this year, boasting 14 mp or higher, don't tend to appeal to me as much as they are marketed to have better \"quality\" because I know better.  So don't be tricked by the number of pixels these cameras have.Optics -This camera has some of the finest optics I have used in a point and shoot digicam.  The 10x zoom of this camera is supurb, the image stabilization compliments the long end of the focal length quite nicely and works well in either mode you have it set to, though I prefer mode 2 (which activates the stabilization at capture - saving the battery).  Even the \"extra\" zoom function works quite well if you can hold noise at bay.  I really can't say enough about this camera's image stabilizer.  This feature makes taking images so much more easy as you don't have to feel tenced while waiting for the camera to \"take\".  I see no optical aberrations, and it has a very lovely, if not slightly more saturated color reproduction.Movie mode -I have not yet found much use for this feature, at the maximum settings, you can't record beyond 12 minutes (or so) for a single clip (which I imagine is quite good anyway), on a 4 GB SDHC card.  But the video I have recorded is good for what it came from, the sound may leave more to be desired, though.Fit, form, and function -This camera has a very solid feel in the hands (or hand, for we large handed folk).  It's outer case is some form of aluminum, and has a nice matte finish.  The bit of rubber on the grip is nice, and helps make this camera very comfortable to shoot with casually.  The controls are easy to figure out and all where they need to be.  The laymen photographer would likely benefit from a quick glance at the owner's manual to familiarize themselves with some of the more advanced functions, but I think most would take to the understanding on their own quite easily.  The rear LCD screen is a very nice size and has great resolution and works quite well when reviewing and zooming in on images captured.  And the battery life is decent, good for a full day out and about.  One thing I would like to mention is that, as mentioned earlier, I use mode 2 for the image stabilizer and I shoot at medium resolution (5-6 mp) quite often and enjoy long battery life.  You may need to play around with different image quality and resolution settings to find your sweet spot.  I prefer the JPEG-fine quality setting at medium resolution, which gives me more space on my 4 GB SDHC card (approx. 1200 shots per card)I originally bought this camera for my wife, to replace her aging 6 mp fuji finepix series point and shooter.  In the beginning, she didn't find much use for it, leaving it for me to play with for a while and I loved it.  In the last six months however, she has started to use it to do product shots for her handmade jewelry and accessories business she does and she absolutely loves it.  She gets more compliments on how good the images of her products are than offers to buy them.  Gotta love that tough economy, and you also gotta love this camera.  Allaround, it's a great camera at a much cheaper price than I paid last year, brand new -- and a very stylish look and feel as well (we got the blue one).  So get one while you can.  It's super nice if you've got a lot of light, but suffers greatly as light diminishes.  In situations like that, I recommend taking it out of iA mode, selecting a lower ISO, and letting the image stabilizer work for you.  You'll tend to get much better results.", "Date": "May 7, 2009"}, {"Title": "Overall Great Camera !!

KEEP IT SIMPLE...", "Author": "$BILL", "ReviewID": "R3U3TUB44DRXSB", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Picking a digital camera can be a frustrating project. I spent quite a lot of time doing research and testing numerous cameras from the major vendors. If you are looking for a high quality digital camera that is capaple being carried on your person easily then look no further and buy the PANASONIC TZ5S! This is why and what you should keep in mind.1. Quality: This camera is extremely well made with great fit and finish.2. Picture Quality: It takes excellent pictures in all environments. Keep this in mind, most people want a digital camera that they can carry with them, is easy to use, takes great quality pictures, and doesn't cost an arm and a leg. This camera does all that and then some. The majority of photos taken are of family events and friend be it inside or out. The rest is of places or things of interest, ie; vacations, monuments, scenenry on trips, etc. The Leica Lens on this camera is one of the best lenses available. A poor quality lens will almost always hurt actual picture quality. It is also a a 28mm wide angle lens which is far better than the standard 35mm - 38mm lens on many cameras in this class. This will allow you to get a larger area to fit into the picture your taking. You won't have to say, \"Everyone get closer together, squeeze in,\"It also has a great zoom lens, allowing you to get much closer to objects or whatever you want to take a picture of. When you see a camera that says \"3 optical 10 digital\" Pay more attention to the optical zoom number. The higher the \"optical zoom number\" the better in almost all cases. The TZ5S has 10 optical, plus 28mm wide angle which is far better numbers than most other cameras in this class. This will allow you far more flexibilty.3. Price Point; I bought this from AMAZON and not a 3rd party vendor and got a price that was way better than any of the big retailers, by a large margin...$100.00 less at a minumum. A big bang for the buck w/out question. It was delivered at n/c and in 2 days.4.EXTRA'S: Like I said, most people want to be able to grab there camera, turn it on quickly, and take a high quality photo consitantly. In addition to this, the TZ5S allows you to take quality videos like that of a camcorder and can do so in High Definition.5. I've kept this as simple as I can because you can get lost in all features you will never use.  Bottom line is this.This camera is well built, easy to use, has a very high quality..wide angle lens, and a powerful 10 power optical zoom lens, can take video in HD, and produces excellent photos. Other popular brands like Canon, Casio, and Sony all make decent quality cameras. But you won't find a better quality camera with as many powerful feature rich options, at this low a price when compared side by side with the other brands.I wrote this review for the average consumer trying to navigate through the maze of digital camera's out there, not the professional photographer who looks at every little techinal specification. Not that there is anything wrong with that, I just want the majority of you to know this is one excellent digital camera you will be happy with for many years to come.

I had a whole bag full os lenses. It took a while to get anything on film because it took minutes to ponder the shot, get all the hardware assembled and take it. Then, that was pretty much state of the art in amature photography...During the digital age, I had a few Sony Mavika cameras that were horrible cameras, but had a long zoom lense on them. They were big and heavy and shot 1.3mp to 2.0mp shots. I then got a little Cannon that was a great little pocket camera but only had a 3X zoom and didn't do it. I then got a Kodak that had a 10X zoom, but it didn't have anything close to a wide angle. I still have most of that hardware and all of it put together cannot hold a candle to this new Panasonic TZ5K.This one little Panasonic pocket camera does everything that all that bag of expensive 35mm hardware, and all those digital cameras, do and much more.

I used a Canon SD700, until my kids hid it and forgot where they put it ;-}Anyway, what I wanted is something small that can handle the beating of everyday family use and still produce great pictures. I did a fair amount of research and selected the TZ5 based on it's balance of good reviews, price, and zoom/features. After two weeks of shooting with it, here are my current impressions:Pros:- Image quality is great. Not as sharp as DSLR, but I think better than my prior Canon SD700. Also, colors are natural & attractive. Very pleased with the results that it captures- The face-detection/focusing system is really really cool. I'm not a big \"all auto\" shooter, but the TZ5's face detection is so effective that I find myself setting the camera in \"iAuto\" mode most of the time.- Good control placement, menus, and setting flexibility.- The 10x zoom is wonderful. A good range from wide angle to telephoto, gives lots of shooting options.Cons:- Body is considerably larger than the Canon. While better for larger hands, the size makes the TZ5 harder to tote. The metal body feels solid, but as a result, it's heavy. Overall, the TZ5 will not fit comfortably in a pocket, so be ready for a belt case or the need to drop it into your purse.- Shutter lag is bad - almost like it was designed in 2002! Ok, maybe it's not THAT long, but the lag is noticeable and causes missed shots.- Battery life is pretty horrible. Using the huge zoom on the unit, I can't even get through a single 4GB card (about 600 shots). I almost never use the flash, but assume performance would be much worse. It's worth getting a 2nd battery until Panasonic makes the TZ5 more efficient.Haven't found a perfect everyday camera yet (at any price), so there's still an opportunity for some manufacturer to meet the need! That said, this unit is pretty good and I'm happy with it.

We were looking for a different camera that was easier to use, a lot smaller, but still had good image quality and long-telephoto capabilities without having to lug around a 2-lb 70-300mm SLR zoom lens. We settled on the Panasonic DMC-TZ5. I looked at the Canon Power Shot SX110IS (a great camera by the way) after narrowing it down, and the Panasonic won out, mostly due to it's smaller size, and the price was right. Retailers offer this camera at anywhere from $299-329. Costco sold it in a blister back for $239.This is a great camera. The body is constructed of aluminum and sturdy plastic, so it should last a long time and hold up to mild bumps and bruises. It's not that compact, unlike some of the Olympus, Casio, Sony, Canon, and Kodak cameras out there, but then again, they don't offer a 10X zoom capability. It's small enough to fit into a purse, or a coat pocket, but don't plan on putting it into your pants pocket.It's loaded with useful and easy-to-use features. With 10 megapixels, it's an upgrade from the TZ3 and 4 models, which had 7 and 8 megapixel CCD's. it also has an improved software package, which is designed to address a glaring problem found in the other DMC models. It will also shoot 720i high definition video (1280x720 DPI) at 30 frames per second.Although this is what I consider to be an easy-to-use point-and-shoot camera with a lot of automatic functions, it's still got some level of manual control. On the outside, it doesn't get any simpler than this. Looking at the top of the camera, there's a function dial with only 6 positions, an on-off switch, \"e-zoom\" button, shutter release, and zoom rocker. On back is the 3\" TFT LCD screen, a switch that changes from camera mode to photo playback, multifunction D-pad, a display and quick menu buttons.What sold me on it was the lens. It's unusual for digital camera of this nature to have a premuim lens set. It's a 10X optical zoom wide-angle Leica DC Vario-Elmar lens, which is a step above the branded-lenses that come with most cameras. It offers 4.7-47mm (28-280mm 35-mm equivalent with an effective focal-length of F3.3-4.9) with optical image stabilization. Only Sony and Kodak include these (Some of Sony's better camera include Carl Zeiss lenses, and Kodak uses Schneider-Kreuznach lenses). These are high-end lens sets, and they make the most of the small CCD's found in compact cameras. This lens is so good, that the camera's imaging software struggles to keep up with the optics. It wouldn't be unfair to say that the camera can't make the most of the optical quality of the lens!With the function dial in the \"IA\" setting, just point and shoot for very good pictures. There's some manual control in this mode, but to make the most of the camera's capabilities, it needs to be in the normal picture mode. ISO, white balance, exposure compensation, shutter speed, and flash are all adjustible, which is good, because although Panasonic has addressed the problems of the TZ4, they are still present in the TZ5. The problem is lots of noise at high ISO (above 400), and lots of sharpening and noise compensation to boot. I don't recommend using this camera at any ISO above 400 unless you're shooting in bright sunlight or under good indoor lighting. 200-400 ISO works just fine, and leaving the ISO in automatic mode helps a lot. White balance is also adjustible, but again, leaving it in automatic works fine.At high zoom, there's the usual non-SLR ghosting and barrel distortion, but it's not as bad as in other mega-zoom cameras in my opinion. The optical image stabilization works great and is absolutely necessary for high-zoom. The LCD is broght and the resolution is excellent at 460,800 DPI.Overall, despite the persistant noise problems, this is an excellent camera, and takes great pictures for such a small CCD.

Has both point-and-shoot capability (been using it a lot, especially with the pre-set scenes and auto-selection of scenes and loving it) and some manual settings to play around with when I'm in gadgety-mood (but I'm not a photographer, and don't know what half of those things mean... will learn, hopefully!)The zoom is outstanding: I took a picture of my mother from a distance of approx. 20 meters, and I can zoom to see what time her watch is showing.On the down side, I must admit that it is a lot heavier and bulkier than I thought it would be (or indeed, than I realized when I looked at it at the store). It does not fit completely in the palm of your hand and is certainly not light-weight. Most reviews say it's perfect for travelling and will fit in your pocket... makes me wonder what kind of pockets people use...

I was able to take digital photos with the equivilant of a 35-450 mm close up to long lens...without a tripod due to photo stabelizing software. I was able to take photos of the bride at the alter in low light and from far away...just hand held with great effect. And...as an opportunistic photo shooter...I was so grateful for the fast \"shutter speed\" rather than the \"click and wait\" experience I'd had with other digital cameras...All in all it felt like the best of a reflex camera without the hassel of multiple lenses. This new phenom..the Lumix..even let me take great sound videos...at football games...at great distances...All in all amazing. But the camera was like a full sized reflex camera..Lighter weight to be sure, but bulky.Now..here comes the tz5. It has all the advantages I've listed..and even a few more...like wide angle exposure capacity...all the way to 10X zoom...in a palm sized version...for half of the price of the earlier camera. I can and do carry it with me all the time to take advantage of great shots, great light as and when it is available. I may not get the respect of the onlookers compared to using a big pro looking camera...but the result is the same...and I aways have the camera with me so don't end up regretting missing a great shot. For those of you who have been doing point and shoot...you'll love the professional results you get with a Leica lens. For those of you who have been using high end cameras...you'll love that you can get the same results with a point and shoot camera with artificial intelligence and a great lens...without any of the hassle of weight, multiple lenses, tripod etc.This is a great travel camera...many of my best photos are just snapped through a train or bus or car window...with far way views brought close with amazing resolution. But because of the superior lens it also takes professional looking high quality close up or portrait photos just using available light in doors.This is a rave review... I almost witheld one star because the small format of the camera doesn't feel as comfortable to me as a larger one yet..and I miss being able to see through a viewer when in bright daylight.

I'd like to share some of my findings in order to help those who may be in a daze like I was trying to decide which compact camera to choose.  First of all, one has to accept that a compact camera is not going to take as good of pictures as a digital SLR or as good as some of the larger cameras that are in the mid-range between the two.  I've read lots of reviews on compact cameras, and there isn't one cameras I found where somebody doesn't say that it takes terrible pictures, over-exposes, is noisy, doesn't portray the right colors, bad LCD, fragile, etc.  One just has to filter through some of these and understand that some people have bad experiences with a camera or expect too much from it (really high standards).Here are some of the models I considered before buying the TZ5, and my own personal reasons for not purchasing them:Nikon S610 - Yellowish LCD screen, inability to exit menu quickly when wanting to use camera in an instant.Canon SD880IS - Lots of reviews about poor low light performance, LCD has black bar at the bottom that reduced the size of the screen (that could have been just the one I used at the store), plus my previous camera was a Canon and I was just looking for something different.Sony DSCW300 - Didn't want to invest in memory stick switchover - Otherwise, would have considered.So, on to why I picked the TZ5:10x Zoom - Nice feature in a mid-compact sizeLow-light performance - Performs well in low-lightLCD Clarity - Huge LCD that is easy to look at and is very clear.Ease of use - I love all the features, but my wife is concerned with having a camera she can point-and-shoot with ease, which this does nicely.Face detection, 9MP, Image-stabilizer, SDHC compatibilty, 720p videoThe camera is larger than the other models that I mentioned, but unless you are really into a super-small camera then this shouldn't be a problem.  Again, the increase in the size of the camera allows for a better build and higher quality, in my opinion.Also, don't get caught up in the how many megapixels the camera has.  Unless you need poster sized prints, 9-10MP is all you really need.  Anything larger creates huge files that need storage somewhere, and will need to be resized when sharing them.All in all I recommend the TZ5.  It was the perfect camera for our needs.  Good luck in your own search.Update:  I've read some of the reviews about how the pictures don't look as good on their computers as it does on the camera.  I noticed that my pictures look great on my newer LCD monitors (TV and computer), but not so much on my older laptop.

Then I saw the TZ3 with its 10X zoom, but fitting in a shirt pocket size.  I purchased it one week before going to Turkey and Greece.  The pictures were a major dissapointment.  Blurry, dark, slow to focus, I started looking for a Nikon or Cannon with similar features.  I was unable to find any.  Then the TZ5 came to market with a new engine, promising corrections and better features than the TZ3.  I decided to take a chance.  I purchased it along with an 8 gig memory card and was off to Peru and the Galapogas Islands.  The camera performed flawlessly right out of the box.  The new engine is great.  I have over 1000 beautiful photos from that trip .. well, they aren't all great, but that's me, not the camera.

Menus can be accessed in either a quick or full version,...really handy!After testing both the iA & Standard picture mode (more manual settings) I found myself simply using the iA mode.(In both modes, the overall speed of the camera and its focusing is relatively fast)The iA mode really is all you'll need for the majority of your pictures,it takes great point/Zoom/shoot pictures.I could go on and on about the iA mode, all you need to know is that it works well.  Panasonic has done a very good job with this,....most impressive.*Leicas' Wide Angle lens w/ 10X Zoom, including Image Stabilization are the TZ5s greatest attributes.Playback on the HD level LCD screen has to be seen in person,..WOW!!Speaking of HD, you can shoot movies @ 30fps in 720P, (its really 30fps because you can see the fps in RivaTuner software)With the TZ5 you can shoot 2GB if movies at a time, so depending on your quality level, that's around 9~15min. filming.~ If the auto focus came On only after you Zoom, (for that 'refocusing moment') it would make movies even better. My C.AF is Off on movies,... still great!I noticed on night/flash photos you need to be aware of your finger is on the front, as not to partially cover the flash, just a heads up.Overall, I highly recommend the Panasonic TZ5, it's as close to a perfect camera I can think of,.. it really is the pocket SLR.ENJOY!Also:to go along with the TZ5, I have a 4GB SanDisk Extreme III card, BoxWave screen protector, Case LOGIC TBC-3 camera bag & spare battery.", "Date": "June 26, 2008"}, {"Title": "Great Camera!

The TZ5 is what I would consider the closest thing without breaking the budget.I have used it for a few weeks, nearly non stop...here is my breakdown in order of most importance.PROS --1. the 10x Zoom is fabulous, especially with a camera this size. not to mention that it has great stabilization (the best I've ever seen) , great for video mode and low light conditions.2. the intelligent Auto mode really does work well. the exposure, flash intensity & auto focus are consistently good in most all pictures (not as great in low light though, but still better than anything else under $300)3. the LCD will make you completely forget there is no viewfinder (I rarely used one anyway) - it's so large and sharp, you really can see detail well.4. best picture quality of any point & shoot I have used.5. can zoom in and out & auto focus while in video mode6. low light auto focus - this is very good as long as you aren't zoomed in and the subject is 4ft or so away. because of the infrared beam, it will consistently focus well even in near absolute darkness.7. Accessories are cheap (an extra battery is only $8, and a good fitted hard case only $15)8. $$$ - the price is sooo good right now, there really isn't anything that can compare to this camera's features (as long as those features are what you're looking for)CONS - (if these are important to you, you might want to consider waiting for something else)1. Video mode (audio) - this is absolutely the biggest downfall of the camera. to start things off the mic is in a stupid spot, and if you aren't covering it with your left index finger, there still is no shot of getting decent audio.  ------- the audio sounds tin-like and full of background noise. it's also extremely muffled, so much so that it can be hard to tell what people are saying unless they are loud or really close. most everyone sounds like they have a mild lisp. (in ideal conditions, the sound is ok after I boost it with software)(would it have been too expensive to put a better mic in this camera? I would have paid more for it without thinking twice)2. Video mode (video) - although it is HD, the quality isn't that fabulous especially at data rates of upto 25mbs - which eats a 2gb sd card up in 8minutes - there's no way I can afford to keep the original files...they have to be converted to h.264 to save hard drive space. - the video also records bright light reflections as a white vertical bar from top to bottom of the video (ie - light from the sun & reflecting off of cars etc.)3. Few/no manual controls - the manual controls are few and hard to use. I would have really liked manual focus on this camera. It would have given room for a lot more creativity - especially when zoomed in low light conditions, where the camera has a tough time focusing.4. Zoom noise recorded in Video mode - most of the time a little zoom noise is recorded. while zooming back to 28mm loud clicks are almost always recorded at the very end -  also the zoom speed isn't always smooth)5. Low-light auto focus (while zoomed in only) - I think that most every compact has an issue with this. this camera is better than most I've used. It really has a tough time focusing on objects in low light conditions when the camera is zoomed past half way.6. camera size - the camera is bigger than most point and shoots, it was bigger than I expected, but still fits in a larger pocket. (some compromises have to be made to fit 10x zoom in a camera)I have much more to say, but I don't think too many people have that kind of time, so hear is a quick conclusion...If you want a mostly pocketable camera that packs a 10x stabilized zoom, a great auto mode, a bright/large LCD, a zoomable video mode and beautiful pictures (compared to other point & shoots) and have no other requirements...this IS the camera for you...If you want more manual control, a really good video mode and audio that you can hear without tons of background noise...you would be wise to look elsewhere.IN SHORT - If you are buying this camera for it's HD video - DON'T!!!8/10 stars", "Date": "October 30, 2008"}, {"Title": "Wonderful camera", "Author": "T.

I dabble in photography & think of myself as a pretty creative individual, but this camera makes my photos look  professional.  I do suggest you order a SD or SDHC card, screen protector, and camera case at the same time.  You should also expect that everyone will want to hold your camera and take a test photo.I was able to use the camera right out of the box and am continuing to learn about the camera's finer points and multiple image type choices.  For instance, there is an airplane mode feature that allows you to take stunning photos from the window of an airplane as if you were sitting on the wing.  There is also a face detection feature that was something not available on my previous camera.  It still gives me pause when it appears but it also make sure that everyone looks clear & crisp with no red eye.One thing you should be aware of is that there is no viewfinder.  I used a traditional 35mm for many years and gradually grew out of using the viewfinder with my last digital camera, but don't even miss it on the Lumix because of the gorgeous image that pops up on the 3 inch LCD screen.  Also, it doesn't hurt that the movies taken with this camera are just as gorgeous.I also experienced a lag time when taking photos with my last camera, but that is nonexistent with the Lumix and this makes sure that I get my shot every time.

The 3\" LCD with 2x the resolution to all major brand cameras on the market, what that means is you'll get a much better, vivid view on your LCD screen than any other cameras out there. I also find the iAuto mode (intelligent auto) extremely useful. It would analyze the current situation and determine the best suitable scene setting and focus mode for you (face, center, macro, etc).

I shot about 90 images over two days and all but 3 were mis-exposed or out of focus. Color, sharness and exposure were consistently good under a wide range of lighting conditions. One setting identifies the kind of scene being shot and adjusts appropriately. It worked well, focusing on faces in portrait shots and identifying backlit conditions.But, I'm sorry to report, the video performance was very disappointing. I found the videos to go in and out of focus when shooting a subject under bright cloudy skies, even while the subject was at a fixed distance, and I did no zooming.I reread the user manual and it said to turn off the continuous focus setting when taking movies. Could that be correct? Apparently it is, based on other reports of owners that talked with Panasonic tech support. But what happens when someone moves closer or further away? Isn't that what movies are all about? Moving subjects with action and some activity?So I did some checking reading dozens of on-line comments and reviews, and while most reviewers mentioned the issue, none classified it as a deal breaker. The most interesting discussion was on the Panasonic Forum on DPReview where many reported they contacted Panasonic, only to be told \"What problem?, This is the first I've heard.\"Clearly if the camera has to revert to a fixed focus mode to take movies, this is a huge defect. While much about the camera is very good, this is a deal breaker for me. I did try making a number of videos in the fixed-focus fixed and they were slightly better, but, unfortunately  a lot worse than my Canon Elph 900 that's several years old. As a result I have returned the Panasonic camera to Amazon and will wait for this either to be corrected or the next model that hopefully will not have this defect.I would only recommend this camera to those that don't want to take movies.

I LOVE this little camera. He can set it on IA (Intelligent Auto) and get good pictures 95% of the time. (Panasonic has since come out with an updated version with very similar features and I imagine I would love that one too.)What I particularly like about this camera:True wide angle:What does that mean? It means you can get a full group of people in a shot without having to back up so far that they look like ants or you can't really see their faces. It also means that you can get closer to buildings, if you like to take architectural shots, and get more of the building in from closer = better view of the building and its details. Basically you can get closer to whatever you are shooting, get more of the item in the photo and still see it. Very nice for sweeping landscapes on vacation too!Great zoomCombine the fabulous zoom with the awesome wide-angle and you get a fantastic range in one small camera bodyZoom with video!!No one talks about this but most small cameras don't give you the ability to zoom while you are using the video. (check it out) This one does a great job and I really, really like/need this feature. It's much smoother to zoom from the camera than to walk closer once the video is running. So, let me repeat - ZOOM WITH VIDEO :))Very nice image quality.It's not a dSLR but I didn't expect that. I can get very nice images straight out of the camera and I can give it to my mom, my husband, a complete stranger, set it to IA or whatever setting I want and get a nice picture.Tons of settingsThe menu gives you the ability to choose from tons of pre-sets like landscape, macro, pets, snow, fast burst, etc. It has two menu selections to you can set them to the two you use most frequently and it makes it even faster and more convenient to change if you want to.Great IAUse the Intelligent Auto setting and the camera will even change to macro mode for you! It works fabulously.Relatively fast first click and next clickVery acceptable (meaning low) delay from start up to first click and from one click to the next.

I wanted a good point and shoot that would get the job done right out of the box, but still give me a little flexibility with different settings in case I needed them.  I read a million reviews before I settled on the TZ5, and even though I just about went crazy from reading, it really paid off.I needed to replace my old 6.1 megapixel Kodak which was about 5 years old.  It was a fantastic camera and still takes great photos, but it's just wearing down.  I was so pleased with my Kodak, I thought I would be loyal and so I focused on Kodaks.  After much reading and shopping, I settled on the 12 megapixel Kodak Z1285.  I got it at Wal-mart For $151. A week later I returned it and got my money back.  Apparently things have gone down a bit at Kodak since I bought my last one. Side by side comparisons of my old and new Kodak photos were ridiculous. The new Kodak was awful. Inconsistent focus and shutter speed. Indoors, the flash recharge time was agonizingly slow. The HD video was nice, but more of a gimmick it seemed to me. Even my outdoor shots in bright sunlight were of poor quality, and I tried multiple settings.  I just was not happy. Plain and simple.So I continued looking, and was drawn to Canon next.  I almost bought the Canon A590, but the 5+ second flash recharge time was such a drawback it was a deal-killer. I then looked at the Canon A1100, the A2000 and the SD880.  I then almost got the SD880, which had great reviews and features, but honestly, once I got my hands on it, it was simply too small.  This might not be a complaint for some, but I was used to my larger Kodak, and the SD880 was just too tiny with no real grip on it. Even with a wrist strap I didnt want to chance it.Finally I got to the TZ5 through reading various other reviews, and it really seemed to have all the features I wanted.  After getting it from Amazon, my first stop was my son's baseball game. Fantastic photos with the default settings. Brilliant colors, amazing detail - I couldn't be happier.  The zoom is phenomenal and on the other end, the macro setting is equally impressive. The wide angle is something I've always wanted and I can't get over how much more I can fit in the frame. It's taken great still and action shots on the various settings, which are great for those of us who don't really know what we're doing. The menu is very user friendly and the layout of the buttons makes sense.The camera is a little larger and heavier than most of the point and shoots that are coming out now, but I didn't mind that at all.  The weight just make it feel sturdy, like a real camera and not a toy.  The grip is great and won't make you think it's going to slip out of your hand. Plenty of room for your thumb, so you don't accidentally hit something, and the hi res LCD screen is really nice.  If you're looking for something slim to easily fit in your pants pocket, this camera is not really going to be it. Jacket pocket, yes, but in my jeans it was a bit too big.There are plenty of features I have yet to try out, but I'm sure I'll be impressed by them as well. A little reading of the manual will reveal a  lot. I've aslo tried the 16:9 HD video.  It was pretty nice, though the audio had a good bit of noise in it. Still great for capturing moments on video if you don't have a designated camcorder for that.All in all, I can't complain about this camera. And tho the $220 price tag was a little more than I planned to spend, it's well worth the money.  The Kodak Z1285 gave me sub par photos at my son's birthday which can't be replaced.  I wish I'd have gone with the TZ5 back then.  If you're in the under $200 range, pay the extra $20 and get this camera. You won't regret it.JULY 6, 2009 UPDATE:So I've had this camera for a few months now and I still love it. Any of my friends or family who have used it or seen the photos I've taken have all been extremely impressed.  As I mentioned above, read the manual to get some tips on some of the settings because they can really have an impact on how well your photos turn out...indoor, outdoor, etc.  The video is really nice when there's plenty of light. Low light situations aren't the best, but they're not unwatchable.  I'm not crazy about the Quicktime format, but I can live with it. The battery life has been great - I've never been in a situation where I've run out of battery and had to stop to recharge. I would suggest getting nothing less than a 4GB SD card, as the file size for the photos and the HD video can use up space very quickly. The only real complaints I've had are that if I happen to have the camera switched to the wrong setting when indoors, the flash recharge time can be a few seconds, but again, this can pretty much be avoided with the right setting. Also, the software that comes with the camera is not too great. I prefer my old Kodak software or HP stuff.All in all, I'm very pleased with my purchase - the photos are fantastic -which is what it all boils down to.

The LCD display is phenomenal as well, incredibly detailed.  The surprise based on what I've read here is how great the video quality at 720P 30 FPS is. It creates a .MOV file; I'm using premiere elements to convert it to an .MPeg file to stream to a PS3 and ultimately to a 60\" Elite Plasma and a 110' 1080P projector. The image quality is very good and definitely high def. I've got a HDV Sony HC-1 camcorder that records at 1080i and the TZ5's image quality is very good in comparison. I've owned a JVC HD1 720P 30fps HDV camcorder and I find the image quality of the TZ5 much better (I still have footage from the HD1 to compare). The video quality was much better than any DV camcorder that I've seen.

It does a reasonable job at higher ISO levels, but not as good as the DSLR, but I didnt expect it to be. I tried to lighten my load last year, and bought a Kodak, but it was not nearly good as my old DSLR, so the DSLR was still the preferred camera. However I think my second attempt I've got it right. The TZ5 eliminates the need for me to carry a large DSLR with 2 heavy lenses and a video camera. The TZ5 is now my camera of choice and has replaced all that. I'm not a pro, just want some good quality images and videos of my family.For its size, the Camera is heavier than expected, but not too heavy. It a good heft, and helps with stability. It feels like its made well, and not the plastic toy feel that many cameras I tested had.The video was just as important to me, and the quality on these videos are great. Not as good as my video camera as they are a little more grainy and sound not as good, but i think if I put it on a high def TV, the tz5 would win. The Video is not choppy and the colors are nice. The videos are large, but they can easily be converted to another format that is smaller. The zoom is slower than expected in video mode only, but compared to all other point and shoots that dont zoom at all in video, I think it is fine. There have been some comments about sound Quality here, and it had me worried, but I must say, that for 8bit mono, its not horrible. I would put the sound q at 3 stars, as long as your just recording dialog.The amount of features are incredible. I used the auto slide show, and my kids really loved watching, on the television, the automatic slideshow it created complete. It comes complete with 5 different music styles and several transisiton effects. Its quick, easy and fun.The other feature that is not talked about much is the burst mode. It takes a about 2 pictures a second for as long as you hold down the button. It also has a High speed burst mode that takes 2 megapixel shots at about 4 or 5 shots per second. It kinda makes a flip book effect. its incredibly fast.The camera is easy to use and the menues are well thought out and easy.  My wife took the camera the first day we owned it to disneyland without me, and she had no instructions on how to use it. She had no problems using the camera, and took some great pictures and videos.  She stayed with the IA mode, and that did all the thinking for her and the pics look fantastic.Dont forget to update to the latest Firmware. ver 1.2 at the time of this writing.

I was in the market for a camera to take on vacation to Peru - my selection criteria were: compact and easy to carry, powerful optical zoom, quick recovery time between pictures, and great looking scenery pics without noise.  After weeks of playing with both cameras at the local camera stores, I finally decided on the TZ5 due to the more powerful optical zoom.  I'm happy to say that I have not regretted that decision for even a second.  As \"fashion\" is important to me too, I did want a camera that was \"cute.\"  The Olympus was an attractive camera in all colors, but the TZ5 was only available in silver at my local camera stores.  I was disappointed because the silver looked like an ugly kick around children's camera to me.  I ordered it in blue and crossed my fingers.  LOVE THE BLUE!  Very attractive camera!  I've also seen the black and thought that was quite attractive, too.Now to performance.  I couldn't be happier with my pictures from my vacation.  I used many of the different settings and experimented.  I ended up with amazing sunset pictures, crystal clear pictures of Amazonian wildlife (even though they were moving quickly), breathtaking scenic views, and some really great fireworks pictures on July 4th.Of course, the indoor low light pics have lots of noise.  That has been the case with every digital camera I've even used.  So, I always use the flash indoors and there's no problem.This camera is everything I was looking for and more.  Optical zoom on the video mode, AWESOME!  Too many features to mention!

It's so easy to use.  The IA (Intelligent Auto) mode really works!

The only negative I can say about this camera is that sometimes, you get some wierd coloration.  I'm not sure what causes this, but it does happen.  There have been complaints about this on other posts, and I wouldn't be surprised if Panasonic will be coming out with a firmware update that fixes this.The HD Movies look great on my 19inch computer screen, however I haven't been able to get them to display on my plasma TV because I don't own one of those special cables.  One complaint, however is that sometimes the movies go in and out of focus.All said, this is a great \"Point and Shoot\" camera because it does all the work for you.

I haven't had the time to fully explore and learn all the tools this camera holds, but here are some key feature changes and improvements and why I came back for another TZ:New with TZ5:The switch from camera mode to view mode has been taken off the wheel on top of the camera to a more convenient seperate switch on the back of the camera adjacent to the display. Video quality rocks, at a purported 720p! Beware you will need a minimum 10Mbps SD card, especially for highest video settings 6 X 9 - 30 fps. I found some 8GB Sandisk 133x (20mbps) Extreme III SD cards that work great. This camera seems to handle low light quite a bit better than the TZ3, but still a weekness, it appears. I still need some learn time with the scene settings, but have found that it will do long exposures once you understand how. Not sure the TZ3 could ever manage that, and any low light shot I could ever muster was very grainy with the TZ3.Why buy the TZ line?The primary feature that brought me to Panasonic and the TZ3 originally was looking for a pocket digital with a wide angle lens. Getting in more people close up, or more scenery in long shots has always appealed to me. Adding to that a great 10X Zoom that never leaves you wanting, and a 3\" high quality display - great for showing your pictures as well as shooting, and you have a great package.

I really like the camera for several reasons...first, it is relly simple to use.  Even my wife takes great pictures simply by using the Auto/Intelligent mode.  I prefer the \"normal\" mode, and I find the camera gives me multiple options that are all easy to use mainly because the menu system is so logical and well thought out.  The only features that are missing are aperture and shutter priority.  You've got everything else...i.e. W/B, ISO, saturation, exposure control, etc.  These can be accessed easily and quickly (unlike Sony and Canon) to make manual adjustments for shooting.The 10X zoom and electric zoom to 16.9X are terrific as is the 3\" LCD screen.  Connecting the camera to view pictures on your TV is a snap, and the pictures show beautifully in 16:9 mode at near high definition.  Images viewed on my computer are really sharp, and the few prints I've made so far are incredible...as good as my old Minolta SLR with a 1.4 lens...that's saying something.My one complaint is that because the camera is smaller than I am used to, I have to be careful that my right forefinger doesn't cover the flash when I'm shooting indoors.  I suspect that will get better the more I get used to the size.  Also, I found a small carrying case with neckstrap and room for an extra battery to be very helpful.  For memory, I bought  a SanDisk 4GB SDHC card with the MicroMate reader.  It seems to work extremely well, and the reader downloads pictures to my computer very quickly and easily.This is my first Panasonic Lumix camera, and so far, I am very impressed.

I was looking for a camera that was small enough to carry in a pocket, yet not so small I would have to put on my glasses everytime I used it.  The 10X tele lense was also a drawing card, as we would be doing a lot of touring and taking some shots at a distance.The camera arrived 5 days before we left, and I reviewd the manual on the plane flight. This proved enough as the camera operation was intuitive and easy to follow.We enjoyed this camera from the first photo to the last (about 380 pictures).  It took great pictures, and the auto focus and face recognition worked great most of the time.  The 3 most common adjustments, zoom, backlight compensation, and force flash off are convenient and quick to select.  I took a lot of flash off photos (inside museums) and the pictures were surprisingly good.The telephoto was invaluable in recording some of the landscape and architectual details of buildings.I rarely used any setting other than the intelligent auto, and it took care of most scenes with great clarity and exposure.  I took several videos and found them acceptable.  This is where I found the only negative: the zoom apparatus makes a bad squeeking sound as recorded on the video. Sounds like a slow moving rusty door.We met several other passengers who had the same camera and everyone thought it was great.It got a little damp in Naples and Rome where it rained most of the day.  However, it never missed a beat or presented a moisture problem.Overall, I am very impressed and will use this camera over my Nikon D50 for most casual situations.", "Date": "June 8, 2008"}, {"Title": "So much hope, but ...", "Author": "Rosey B. \"Rosey\"", "ReviewID": "R1LY9W9AW0WZBT", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "My old 3.2 MP camera was dying so I needed a replacement.  I wanted something with more than the standard 3x optical zoom, compact, and well built.  The TZ5 seem to fit the bill so decided to give it a try.I had the TZ5 [blue model] for 3 weeks and snapped over 200 pictures.  The camera looks good and feels well built.  It is easy to hold even for those with small hands. Camera responds quickly. Menus are responsive and easy to navigate.  I think it takes great videos for a digital camera with okay sound.  However, photo quality is mixed.Outdoor pictures were okay.  They were great in that the 10x optical zoom allows one to take pictures from further away than the standard 3x optical zoom many cameras have.  However, the pictures themselves were generally good, but not exceptional.Indoor and low light photos were a major disappointment.  With the Lumix TZ5, most of my indoor shots were at best just okay.  Many seem to have a yellow or brownish haze.  Generally, colors were not accurate. Photo editing software rendered them okay for 4x6 prints.  Although I tried adjusting the settings many times and in different ways,  I just could not snap a good indoor or low light photo with this camera. My old camera did much better with such situations.Ultimately, I returned this camera.  Amazon.com was great with the return and the refund.As a replacement, I purchased the Sony Cybershot DSCW150 8.1MP Digital Camera with 5x Optical Zoom with Super Steady Shot (Silver) which generally snaps great pictures in all lighting situations (with and without flash) with little effort and little (if any) post photo editing.

In daylight or flash, it's tops; and in low light, it beats all other cameras in its class.

It's not a shirt-pocket camera, but can easily fit into cargo-pants pockets.- Focus is quick and accurate. (Yes it is slower in low-light w/ high-zoom.

A tripod helped, but was not necessary. I tried several shots just resting my arms on the chair in front of me, and it worked fine.- Video quality is excellent.- Image stabilization works great.- Included software is fun and comprehensive.- LCD display quality is the best I've seen.

(LCD works well in daylight, but in direct sun, nothing can compete with an actual viewfinder.)- Get at least a 2GB card (4 or 8 is even better). I got a 4GB and it is more than adequate.

Each has been incrementally improved over the preceding model. If there is a better, pocket-sized point 'n shoot digital camera with a 10x zoom out there, I haven't found it.  The TZ5 has a 10x Leica lens that begins its range at 28mm. I absolutely love this feature because you can shoot a group two or three feet closer than with the more typical 35mm equivalent lens.  Response time is typical for a point 'n shoot. If you need instantaneous shutter response, shell out the bucks for a DSLR.  The built-in flash is the weakest part of this camera. It feels slow to recycle. It will not stop you from taking a shot before it has fully recycled, but your color balance and exposure will be way off. Redeye prevention seems to work pretty well. I've had a lot fewer shots with redeye than I did with the prior model.  I can't tell if the face detection feature is working or not. It doesn't seem to make much of a difference.  As is the case with all Panasonic digital cameras, the optical stabilization system is marvelous, making many otherwise impossible shots a simple matter.  There's no optical viewfinder, but the display screen is large, finely detailed and visible in all but direct sunlight.  Overall exposure is good. I haven't had a problem in any of the several thousand shots I've taken that I could attribute to the camera's exposure handling.  Needless to say, at higher ISO equivalent speeds, there is noise. Just part of what you're going to get with a point 'n shoot.  Movies made with the TZ5 are great. With halfway decent lighting, exposure is excellent and motion capture is very, very smooth without artifacts. I really enjoy the convenience of having a high quality motion capture capability in a digital still camera. Movies are in Quicktime format. Filesize is limited to 2GB, but you can save multiple 2GB files to a large SDHC card. I've used up to 16GB SDGC card in the TZ5 without a problem.  Panasonic claims about 300 shots from a battery. I feel lucky if I get 150 flash shots. Plan on buying and carrying one or two extra batteries with the TZ5. The recharger is small with folding prongs.  All in all, this is a great pocketable point 'n shoot. The only serious negatives I have with it - and they are common to all cameras of this class - are a somewhat deficient flash unit and slow shutter response times.

The photos come out just great in IA mode. Press down and the camera makes its first assumption on what it is you're focusing, if that's not correct, release and try again. Face recognition works great, too. And most important to me was that it takes great photos in low light without a flash. I had the flash off for all my shots. I got the camera in blue which is done in a powder-type of coating. I didn't care for that at first, but now I like it because it makes the camera a little grippier and it looks great.Two things that could need fixing:1. When taking a movie, the zoom makes a noice when zooming in and out.2. When reviewing your photos, holding down the advance button should fast-forward you through the photos. It only does one at a time.

Initially, I hesitated in this choice because of the lack of full manual controls, but the TZ5 lived up to the glowing reviews.The centrepiece of the camera is the wonderfully sharp Leica lens with a 28mm - 280mm span(35 mm equivalent) that covers all possible shooting situations from wide angle to telephoto. I travel a lot, and often use the wide angle setting to take pictures of buildings and landscapes and the telephoto setting to zoom in on the details. The Optical Image Stabilization feature allows you to take pin-sharp pictures even at full zoom without any camera shake.The camera is solidly built, with a metal construction and a good weighty feel. The huge 3\" LCD screen takes up most of the back and this is a real beauty, bright and clear even in sunlight and with a very high resolution.Operating the TZ5 is simplicity itself, with the full auto iA setting taking care of every aspect, even analysing the scene and selecting approriate settings such as portait or landscape. For greater manual control, there is a programmable auto setting where you can adjust various parameters and a large number of \"scene\" modes. But on the whole, the full auto setting works well, and I expect to leave it there for most situations.The Panasonic image processing engine does an excellent job of removing imperfections, leaving almost no post-processing to be done to have print-ready pictures.As an added bonus, the camera has a 720p HD video mode, useful for occasional video taking - but the memory card will fill up fast!In summary, the TZ5 is strongly recommended as an advanced point-and-shoot compact camera, ideal for travelling.", "Date": "June 23, 2008"}, {"Title": "5 stars plus applause to Amazon", "Author": "Ms. S.

And its easier to grip than the slightly smaller ultra-compacts. The preset \"scene\" settings for beach, night, portraits etc. are convenient and give good results. I look forward to becoming familiar with the manual settings to get even more out of it.TZ5 video quality is exceptional in daylight. Though limited by the software to 15 minutes per shoot, the 16:9 high quality setting produces home video image quality as good as any video cam I've used. Its full HD if the $35 optional \"component\" cable is used. And it zooms while videoing, though the autofocus might not keep up in large changes.Now for the bad stuff.- The LCD view screen is very difficult to use in bright sunlight.- Lack of a simple optical view finder makes it difficult to frame small subjects in sunlight.- The lag of 2-3 seconds between shots is irritating.- Control menu for picture settings is not very user-friendly. The screen menu is confusing unless you really study the instructions. Some control labels in menu settings don't match the controls.- Settings knob lacks crisp detents and is easily shifted by putting the camera in your pocket or a bag.The TZ5 can take superb pictures, but to do so requires more attention than an idiot-proof snapshot camera like a Kodak. Its best feature is that it packs the potential for exceptional shots in a pocket camera.", "Date": "March 8, 2009"}, {"Title": "Good Camera!", "Author": "S.

Picture quality is amazingly good, the different scene modes offer a wide variety of choices and settings, there are 22 scene modes, with some pretty unusual ones. I love the aerial view mode, which lets you capture amazing shots from a height. Picture quality is great, night mode is specially good. I love the intelligent auto mode, it's phenomenal. Close up shots offer great details.this has a 28mm wide angle Leica lens with image stabilization, that speaks for itself.The navigation and menu is well organized and the camera is very easy to use.The only things that I wish in this camera is manual option, for shutter speed and aperture controls.Overall, great buy for a good price.

But it does focus well.  Speed seems perfectly fine during the day.  Nice default color rendering.  The 10x optical zoom is awesome!It does put all sorts of tags in the metadata (vacation location, vacation time, mode used, auto mode details), but I can't seem to access them from Adobe or most other photo tools.

We have been greatly pleased with it's performance. It has excellent picture quality, even at full 10x optical zoom. One feature we liked are the many different scene selections, but we were disappointed that it lacked the panoramic feature. It does however have a wide angle lens which does help out on the wide shots. It is very easy to use, but you do have to be careful not to cover the flash bulb or the mic while shooting. This is very easy to do, but once you get the hang of it, it's pretty easy to avoid. We purchased a 16 GB HDSC card to go along with it, which gives you about 3500 pictures at the full 9.1 megapixel setting which is great.

I am used to a Canon, which numbers the picture according to date and starts each day as number 1. I have set the travel feature, so maybe that will take care of that problem.- the case that I bought for it. It is the one made specifically for this camera by Panasonic and was fairly expensive. I would not buy it again. The camera barely fits in it and there is no room for extra batteries.

My friend, to whom I gave a matching camera captured great pictures, also - with ease!I love the video feature which allows you to zoom - an upgrade to other Panasonic cameras - and capture great moments.

After scouring the adds for Point&Shoot; digital cameras, I settled on the Panasonic TZ5. I got the camera in the mail a couple of days ago and so far, I'm not dissapointed.The camera is really well built, but the tripod socket is made of plastic and the door to the USB Ports is made of some real flimsy plastic(Why Panasonic decided to do that, I don't know ?) Everything else is metal.There is not that many controls, or switches (thank god), but the Menu system is, pretty extensive. I kind of like the weight of it, makes it feel like you are carrying a precise instrument, not a plastic toy you got at the discount store. The Leica brand on the lens certainly adds to the prestige.I haven't taken many pictures with this camera yet, but from what I can tell so far, the images are very sharp and natural in color, if you keep the ISO below 400. Even above an ISO of 400, maybe up to an ISO of 800 the pictures are still very acceptable.What I really love about this camera is the ease of operation. I only had to refer to the all-English and well written manual a few times to learn how to operate it. Navigating the menus is really simple and intuitive once you learn how to interpret some of the icons.I would have given this camera 5 stars instead of 4 if it had at least one Manual function and a viewfinder and if the lens was a little faster. Not being acustomed to composing pictures on an LCD instead of a viewfinder can be a little daughting, however you can display a Grid on the LCD panel to aid you in the composition another value addition.The camera came without a carrying case, or flash card, but you can purchase these items as accessories separately. I purchased a Lowenpro case that B&H; and Amazon advertise on their websites, rather than getting the Panasonic semi-hard case which seemed a little bulky. Nevertheless, The Lowenpro case is not exactly sleek and slim either. I also purchased an 8gig card so I would have enough space for videos.If you want to remain anonymous I would recomend placing the camera inside a jacket pocket since it's to bulky to fit inside a shirt pocket.All in all I am very satisfied with this camera. It takes great pictures, it looks nice, it takes videos with sound, it is easy to operate, it's quiet, the deceptively small flash is pretty powerful and produces nice even lighting.One thing I noticed that in automatic mode the flash fires almost every time even in bright sunlight. Good thing you can force the flash not to fire through the Menu.All in all this camera is like my cell phone. Small enought to carry with me everywhere. Now if I see a something that looks like it might make a great picture, I could just reach inside my jacket pocket and fire away.

I typically use a Canon EO 20D which I LOVE but sometimes it's more than I want to carry around and not the most convenient to use in some situations. I was looking for a small compact camera that I could easily tuck into a small purse or a deep pocket but one that would also give me fantastic pictures. A friend of mine had this camera and I was impressed with the long distance shots she was getting without difficulty. After researching the different cameras on the market and asking friends about the small cameras they were using, I decided that this camera met the requirements I had of a small camera and I have not been disappointed. I was looking for the ability to get those distance shots and this camera sounded like the one to choose if that was an important feature. Someone else mentioned that they don't like it when reviewers mention that they did a lot of research but then don't mention the cameras they reviewed. Since I didn't try out any of those cameras, I can't give a review of the products. I primarily looked at as many published reviews by reputable sources that I could find, talked with different camera vendors, and spoke with many friends who have owned a variety of cameras. Again, other than the lack of a view finder, this camera seemed like the most appropriate for my needs and the purchase priced seemed right since it was well under $300.00 when I purchased it.A number of reviewers mentioned the problem of not having a view finder when you are in bright sunlight. I found the same to be true when outside on a dark night with little light available. Without a view finder, I cannot always see the subject I'm trying to photograph under these conditions. Amazingly, I've been able to take great pictures with little difficulty by aiming in the direction of my subject and shooting. Not only am I able to capture the pictures I desire, the flash has been sufficient to get very nicely lit pictures when I actually expected them to turn out to be too dark. Friends of mine who have other popular compact cameras have been impressed that my pictures are so much better than theirs under these conditions.I have had the camera for a little over six weeks and have taken approximatey 1000 pics so far under a variety of conditions and am quite pleased with how my pictures have turned out.I agree with reviewers who suggest that buyers purchase a backup battery and the SD Extreme III 8 GB card. I take a lot of pictures and have had to change batteries at times and was glad I had the back up battery when needed.My life has been very busy lately so I haven't had a chance to really review the manual and try out all the features of this camera so the fact that I'm so happy with this product already is significant.

I have had a Panasonic DMC-FZ30 for several years and have been very pleased with it's performance.  It takes wonderful pictures and the 12X zoom is great.  The one drawback has been its size, about that of a standard SLR.

The image quality is very good. The only major complaint I have is the long shutter lag when the flash is on. It becomes especially worse when the red-eye reduction is also enabled.Overall, I am happy with my purchase (I even tried out a Canon 880IS, and the Pani is on-par with this one for the most part.

The first was an Olympus Camedia C-740.  The Olympus C-740 was a good camera when it was introduced, but there were always things about it that annoyed me - like the long shutter lag, poor auto-focus, poor low-light sensitivity, etc.  When I decided to buy a new digital camera I wanted to be sure it did not have any of the problems that the old one had.  After my experience with the Olympus, I was skeptical about finding a small, point-and-shoot camera with a long zoom that would perform well in low light conditions.  I did a lot of research trying to find a camera that wasn't too large, but still had impressive features at a reasonable cost.  The Panasonic Lumix DMC-TZ5 has exceeded all of my expectations.I am a mechanical engineer and I design equipment used to package products in various industries.  I often need to take pictures of a customer's plant prior to installing equipment as well as after install.  Most of the plants that have our equipment are poorly lit and our equipment is large enough that a flash will illuminate only a small portion of the machine - leaving much of the image dark.  With the Lumix I have been able to take clear, crisp photos in some of the worst conditions - without a flash!Another great feature of this camera is its ability to take relatively high-resolution videos with sound.  Now I can get great stills and video without having to carry two different devices.  Plus this camera is only half the size of my old Olympus and much smaller than the camcorder I used to use for video.  The Panasonic fits comfortably in a breast pocket when not in use.The camera is easy to use with many automatic modes to choose from.  It is comfortable to hold and all the controls are within easy reach of your thumb or forefinger.  The large LCD screen makes composing shots easy and is great for viewing the pictures you have taken.The only drawback I can think of is that if you do use the flash it tends to drain the battery fairly quickly.  This hasn't been a problem for me since I rarely need a flash, but if you are going to be using the flash I would recommend getting a spare battery.Overall, this is a great camera - combining excellent features and performance in a comfortably small package for a reasonable price.", "Date": "April 28, 2009"}, {"Title": "Best Value Camera in the price range.", "Author": "Jeff Liang \"Electronic Addict\"", "ReviewID": "R1937EDYAPQ2CP", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "After getting this camera last year, I've recommend 4 other people with this camera, and all of them Loved the camera just as much as I do(My grandma, my aunt x 2, my friend, my cousins all loved it absolutely!!).

This certainly didn't require anything expensive, and my I worked my 10 year old Sony Handycam to death for my test shots.When I learned that Digital Cameras were coming out that could shoot in 720p with nice results I decided to start looking at them instead of camcorders.  Pretty much the entire Panasonic Lumix line is filled with great little cameras that provide a decent 3MBps (MegaBytes).  Other brands offered some competition in this area, but few could keep up with quality of pictures and video.Reading all the reviews, and I was sold on the TZ5.  And after using it for a while, it has met and well exceeded my expectations.In low light, video is great.  My first video in low, non-direct florescent light still produced a perfect motion capture and near flawless camera export into 3DS Max!  I've never had a capture go so smoothly before, even sunlight shots with my handycam.The zoom on this thing is incredible, and yes you can use the zoom while shooting HD video.  The motion stabilizer is great, and I've never felt I've had to turn on the flash even in moderately lit rooms.The Intelligent Auto mode is great when you don't want to have to worry about the settings before shooting a shot, it get's the automatic settings right every time.  At 100 and 200 ISO, pictures look comparative to an SLR, and of course 400 and above get kinda grainy, but that's just standard fair.In the compact digital camera range, there is no better camera.

Not that this camera has not provided me with great service which it did over the years, but somethings it does very well but some not so well. For one thing the camera shutter lag can be extremely anoying especially when shooting with flash and can lead to blury photos if you are not careful.Pointing the camera anywhere near the sun causes the LCD to either black out or to display a red vertical band accross the screen. Even though this red band does not show up in the picture, it can be very annoying. Another thing is the akward non-intuitive Panasonic software that comes with the camera, I just bypass it and go straight to Photoshop or Photo Shop Elements otherwise I would be wasting my time. So far these minor anoyances I can live with, I mean I did for last three years.The biggest problem however, is with the lens distortion. I'm not sure whether I should call it pin-cushion distortion or perspective distortion, but the distortion becomes evident when taking group shots. The camera has a way to make the center subjects smaller than the subjects on the sides and smaller than they appear in real life. I have never come accross this type of problem before, as far as i know so it took me a little bit by surprise.For example lets say I'm taking a picture of 3 people all 6 feet in height. The camera will make the person standing in the middle look as if they are 5'8\". I had to do a double take because it is so subtle, but when I started to really notice it, I avoided taking group shots altogether. Or I would make sure when doing so that everybody was standing in parallel. This can be extremely limiting and takes the joy and purpose out of owning a point-and-shoot. I'm not sure if it's the camera or the lens a Leica lens at that ?Other than that the camera is great, but I just don't think I can put up with the distortion problem anymore now that I know it's real...", "Date": "April 14, 2013"}, {"Title": "Great little camera.", "Author": "P.

You can choose 4:3, 3:2, or 16:9 ratios. I use this for taking 16:9 pictures which I typically add to video productions.When taking videos, the 30 fps mode provides a good video picture. The drawbacks to me are:1. The tiny microphone is located on the top of the unit, not the front. I suppose this is good if you are taking a video of your vacation, and your mouth is right there next to the mic and you are describing what is being seen. If you are trying to video your kids playing or an event, the mic is then pointing straight up and will NOT capture much of what is being said directly in front of the camera... certainly not clearly.2. To make audio matters worse, there is no 3.5mm plug for an external microphone. Most mics for use with consumer cameras and camcorders have a 3.5mm plug. It would be nice to have a jack on this camera to accommodate a microphone.So the camera does well with the visual aspects of photography, but audio capabilities leave much to be desired. Want some good video of the new grandchild? Go purchase a camcorder. I did. And it is a Panasonic HDC-TM900. I recommend it highly. Cost may be an issue, but you get what you pay for, and with proper care, you'll have it for at least 10 years. Purchased a RODE Videomic Pro microphone to go along with it. With these two cameras and the external mic, I'm now all set to capture some memorable moments with great HD video, and outstanding sound!I don't recall if I purchased this TZ5 at Amazon.

The Lumix TZ5 was a good travel companion and turned out to have few flaws.Since it irritates me when people say that they do a great deal of research and then never share it (doesn't that irritate you?), here are some of the cameras I ruled out based on my (maybe not your) criteria:Fujifilm FinePix F100fd (difficult menu design, pink banding issue), Canon PowerShot SD890 IS (reported awful handling and poorly designed controls), Casio Exilim Card EX-S10 (No image stabilization, very slim, picture quality ok, weak zoom, tiny controls), Casio Exilim EX-S880 (No image stabilization, reported poor image quality), Olympus Stylus 850 SW (reportedly poor video shooting, poor battery life), Pentax Optio V10 (No image stabilization), Casio EX-Z1080 (Reduced pixels compared to others, 38mm starting range), Panasonic Lumix DMC-FX55 (Reportedly falls short on image quality, no viewfinder, larger), Ricoh Caplio R7 (No optical viewfinder, very noisy, some barrel distortion when fully extended, poor customer service?, reported quality mediocre), Pentax Optio A40 (Reportedly poor autofocus), and Canon PowerShot A470 (No viewfinder, no image stabilization, weak zoom).Unfortunately, doing all this research meant I didn't get the Lumix TZ5 till right before my trip to Amsterdam - I was literally reading the manual on the plane. I don't recommend this, but it does serve as a good crash test for what the camera could (and could not) do out-of-the-box.As you probably know, this isn't an ultracompact but it is not as big as some reviewers make out. Could fit in a large pocket but it is rather heavy and unprotected in that environment so I got a LowePro case for it that sat on my belt. Worked well, allowed for extra batteries and SD card, and access was quick for candid shots.Things that worked well:* The Intelligent Auto mode worked pretty well for most situations. I suggest studying the exposure compensation settings since I had to use these often in high contrast and full sun situations.* One handed operation works well.* Menu system was pretty intuitive for basic functions.* Zoom is amazing and E.Zoom setting was very useful. Be sure to read how to use the \"extended optical zoom\" which lets you go out to 16.9x at reduced picture quality (I believe you have to have picture quality set at max 9MB and this is then reduced to 3MB). I didn't use the digital zoom.* The screen is gorgeous and the playback is amazing - many people commented on this.* Taking video is pretty easy, though I would have preferred a button rather than having to rotate a dial. Be careful on playback to distinguish between what is a still picture and what is video - I accidentally deleted some video because I thought they were poor still shots, rather than the start of the video.* If the dial is accidentally rotated, the camera will not let you take a picture until you correctly choose an actually setting.* Fairly quick start up - not stellar but not bad.* Can set up something called Travel Date, which will organize pictures by 1st, 2nd, 3rd day. This was useful when sharing pictures and to help you remember the chronology of the trip.* You can zoom while taking video, although more slowly than with still shots.What didn't work well:* No matter what you read, the pretty LCD screen is no replacement for a view finder even when you use the Auto Power LCD option to compensate. In daylight, even on the brightest setting, the screen washes out. Another problem I had was I had to remove my glasses to compose on the screen, which was a hassle with rapidly-moving candid shots. This was the biggest disappointment and I took off one star for this.* Certain functions of the camera will only work in certain settings. For example, you can only set the self-timer for 10 sec in IA mode, histograms cannot be displayed in IA mode, exposure settings can only be used in normal mode, extended optical zoom cannot be used in motion picture mode, etc. It can be frustrating, and you can miss a good shot, if you don't have all that memorized. I imagine all cameras are like this, but thought I would mention it since we are discussing an out-of-the-box experience.* The door to the sockets on the right-hand side comes open easily (does not lock closed but only snaps shut), which is a hassle at times. I am concerned that it will snap off one day.* In my opinion, the flash is underpowered.Overall, I am happy with the TZ5 and impressed with the pictures and video it produced - especially since I had so little experience with it. My friend, who is a film maker by trade, was also impressed with the camera. It is bigger than I would have liked, but the trade off for a 10X zoom was worth it for me.Do get an extra battery - I went through both batteries in 4 hours of shooting, mostly stills but some video. Big hassle to run out of juice in the middle of your day. A SD Extreme III 8GB was recommended in some reviews and it worked well for me, especially with shooting video. In doing research about buying a camera, one of the most helpful websites I found was the \"What Camera Should I Buy?\" forum at the Digital Camera Resource Page - [...]In looking at the reviews here on Amazon for the TZ5, be aware that they are organized by color, so check each color for information about this camera.", "Date": "May 31, 2008"}, {"Title": "If you know what you're getting into, you'll be thrilled", "Author": "New Englander", "ReviewID": "R3QYY339T5VJ0Y", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I already wrote a review on the little sister, the TZ4, which is a phenomenal camera; I am however returning it because the price differential with the TZ5 is so low at this point it made more sense for me to spring for the few extra bucks on the TZ5 .If you read any professional reviews, you already know that this is not the camera for poster size enlargements, even at low ISO values. While the noise reduction has been turned down, there is still some NR smudging  and  noise. Thankfully, the noise at least can be removed to the point where I was able to doctor a sample ISO 1600 picture to look just fine in 4 x 6 size (thanks to NeatImage). And I've had no problems with 8 x 10's at ISO 100 and 200.And guess what? That is THE ONLY issue with this camera, and it is one that all other compact cameras also share to various extents. The difference here is that many other compacts also add lots of other \"negatives\" to the mix, such as severe wide angle distortion, wild and wooly purple fringing, reduced zoom range, and corner blurriness . The TZ 4 and 5 do nothing of the kind.For what you're getting, a compact, POCKETABLE 28 - 280 Leica lens with IS, there simply is nothing like it out there. And that's before even looking at the HD movie mode, the surprisingly accurate intelligent scene selection feature, the brilliant LCD and the jewel-like workmanship.This is the ultimate vacation camera if you plan to leave your DSLR home and travel lightly, and aren't spending all day in museums shooting w/o flash.

I have been using the TZ3 for 2 years and took more than 10000 pictures with amazing results. I take many night shots and this is really where this camera excels. It can take 15, 30 and 60 seconds exposures which no other compact can do.Battery life es very acceptable. A second battery is a recommended inexpensive accessory. The camera build quality is good, durable materials and high quality. I have evaluated a huge number of cameras and the Lumix comes on top by far based on its image quality, image stabilization, optical zoom, Leica superior lens, form factor and overall value.

I've grown jealous of a friend's Panasonic DMC-TZ3 which he keeps on his belt loop in a Lowepro Rezo 30 case.  It also has a wide angle lens which I don't have on the FZ7.  I've purchased the TZ5 as a second camera for when I want to be a more discreet tourist without a camera bag.  This may become my primary camera.I am not a fan of small cameras as a rule.  Some of them (e.g., Canon Elph) have screens and icons so small, I can't see them.  But this camera has a lot of  features, most also available on the TZ3 & new TZ4.  (The TZ3/TZ4/TZ5 fit into the Lowepro Rezo 30 case, but no room to spare.)The choice of which model to buy depends on your need for Megapixels and what you are willing to spend.  I have used my friend's TZ3 and don't really notice any significant improvements in the workings of the TZ5 that would justify the price for routine point-and-shoot photos.  However, the TZ5 has a 3 inch LCD while the TZ3 & TZ4 only have 2.5 inch.  That was a deciding factor for me.If you need a camera where you look through a traditional view finder to frame your photos, this is not the right camera for you.  I prefer using the LCD screen, so I don't miss this feature.I find the Panasonic menus easy to use to access all of the varied features.  If you just want to use it as a point-and-shoot, it's easy to do.  If you want to experiment, the features are there for you to play with...There is another feature on Panasonic that is an absolute MUST for me.  It is possible to set the flash \"off\" so it doesn't go off when you don't want it to (i.e., in places that restrict flash photography).  Some of my friends have cameras where they have to turn the flash off each time.  And they forget...Another reason I opted for the Pansonic FZ/TZ series is the easy to use battery charger/rechargeable battery.

Also, this is my first advanced point and shoot camera so I cannot compare it to others I didn't own.  I've tested the reasons why I chose this particular camera.  The high resolution, compact size (can't really test that except that it fits in my pocket great!), and its ability to shoot high resolution video.The high resolution is amazing but only a 4 star.  4 because there will be much playing around to do in order to get the sharpest possible image.  Perhaps the ISO was set too high, perhaps I didn't use the perfect setting, much playing around to be a perfectionist - and only because I am coming off a manual digital camera where you have full control.The pre-set settings in this are incredible!  It even has a pre-set setting for PETS!  I shoved the camera in my spaztic cats face and as he was trying to get away, I had a clear and up close shot of his face (with FLASH!) Any other digital camera and it would have been fuzzy or non existant as the lag between shutter, flash, and actual photo would be greater than the cat's ability to dissapear within a second.  I did this more than once - super sharp and ultra fast!  Poor cat...There are baby-settings where you can give it a name and birthdate!  Probably so you can title your pictures automatically later - I don't know yet - but it's cool!Face detection - perfect!  4 faces in one shot I believe.  Also, the flash compensates to the distance to each face (multiple flashes) so if you're closer to one person, that person's face won't be washed out in light!  That's amazing technology!Enough tech - plenty more in there to play with - onto the video!I wanted a camcorder replacement so I don't buy another gadget just to take the few videos I DO want to take.  Something fast and easy to capture the moments as they arrive out of nowhere.  This camera's ability to take 1280x720 wide-screen videos to display on our flat-screen is what I was looking for.  I only give it 4 stars though - which is STILL such a feat!  The reason for a missing star is the camera's inability to focus fast enough on moving objects or while you're zooming.  I'm sure the motor tech will develop over subsequent cameras but for SUCH a small package to deliver such high resolution \"clips\" is truly a feat!  The maximum length of video at the highest resolution [tested] is 2GB [turned out to be 10:38 minutes].  Most videos won't need that much continuous shooting anyway so that's not a big deal.  The format is Quicktime's MOV.  I'll need to play around with transfering that to DVDs but looks great on the computer!  You can get the optional component cable that hooks directly onto the camera to the TV for instant enjoyment. (it comes with a VGA cable).  [I hooked up the camera to a 42\" HD Plasma via the AV cable and got a great resolution - better than a broadcast TV and JUST shy of HD sharpness - but I was up next to the screen so sitting back at the couch - doubt I could tell the difference.  The AV cable is mono with one video out so the sound only came out of the center channel speaker.  I'd give the sound 3-stars as there was a detectible background noise - I made sure to test it with little sound to decipher.  Sounds and voices came out clear - but it was not high fidelity by any means.  This is definately NOT a surround sound HD camcorder!  The camcorder \"clips\" however are phenomenal!]Oh, also, to download pictures from the camera to the computer?  NOTHING REQUIRED TO INSTALL!!!!  You plug the camera in the USB port, turn on the camera, choose PC on the camera (you can set it to always be that), and the computer recognizes it as a hard-drive from where you can drag and drop to your hearts content!This is NO DSLR where you have full control - but that's not what this is for.  So as you can tell, I highly recommend it and know it will be the perfect companion for pretty much all your photo-video needs in ONE tiny package (which travels VERY well!).[I am still working on posting samples - I'm sure others will beat me to the punch now that it's widely available and on sale]", "Date": "March 21, 2008"}, {"Title": "Nice upgrade over my TZ3", "Author": "D.

I've taken several dozen test pictures under different circumstances, and the results were for the most part very good. Under perfect conditions, the results weren't much different than the TZ3. Under low light conditions, the Venus IV engine seems to do a little better with noise at ISO 400 and above. I wouldn't call it a dramatic improvement though. I'm going to do a little \"pixel peeping\" in the near future to see how the TZ5's small sensor handles the increase in megapixels.

I'm so happy with its performance and feature-set, I'm willing to forgive the lack of manual controls and the price drop I just saw.I pre-ordered and also bought a 16Gb SDHC card.  I plan on having this device replace my current Canon Powershot A75 and my Sony TRV-608 camcorder.  I can plan this way because... this camera shoots 720p high-definition video.  My big-screen LCD will really allow the captured video to shine.  In my preliminary tests on a 22\" LCD, the output is gorgeous, so much clearer and vibrant than the Hi-8 video I would shoot using the old Sony.It's a wonderful progression of technology.  My Sony camcorder can shoot in zero light, zooms to some ridiculous level, but I hardly ever use it because it's yet-another-device you need to carry.  My Canon worked well for three years, then decided to stop running.  I loved the manual controls and ability to bracket shots, but with 3x optical zoom, I was missing something.  Plus, it was a family camera, and The Wife could not care less about manual controls.The Lumix TZ5 is a perfect blend of features and performance for me.  It will allow me to grab high-definition camcorder video in the same device I can just hand to The Wife and say, \"Press the button\".  It has a removable Li-On battery with separate charger, so I can buy a spare and keep them charged and ready to travel.  It does a lot, for a fair price.I will miss the manual controls, especially for low-light shots, but in my testing I've already seen how well it can handle low-light with no flash.  Pictures look remarkable, shutter lag is less than the A75, and flash recharge is not too bad.  The LCD screen is huge compared to the A75, almost the size of a PDA screen.  That'll take some getting used to, especially since there's no optical viewfinder.

It's downfall was a tiny little LCD screen and a limited zoom range that ended at 35mm on the wide end. I wanted a camera that went down to at least 28mm and had a clear, large LCD. I looked at the Canon 870IS and the Nikon P-80 but settled on this. Why? The Canon's LCD was not as clear as the Lumix and it had a limited zoom range on the top end. And, to be honest, it didn't have some of the 'bells and whistles' that the Lumix did. The Nikon was really not pocketable and has been getting horrible reviews all over the internet since it's recent introduction (Amazon, DPReview.com, etc.). It seems that Nikon really knows how to do dSLR's but comes up way short in the P&S; category. I also briefly considered the Fuji 100SD but rejected it due to well known problems with pink banding and purple fringing. If you like to do a lot of low light, higher ISO photography though, the Fuji should be on your very short list.I know a number of people have complained that the TZ5 is 'not as small' as they thought/hoped it would be. C'mon guys, this thing has a 10x zoom that goes down to 28mm!!! Something with those capabilities is never going to be the size of a credit card! And the thing for me is that I just can't stand geometric distortion and the Panasonic/Leica is a real champ in this regard. There's nothing worse than that horrible barrel distortion you see in so many wide angle lenses. This one has none of that. The trade off is that it gets iffy at higher ISO's. You can effectively prevent this by setting the camera to never let the ISO get above, say 400. The camera allows you to do this. The Optical Image Stabilization (\"OIS\") is really superb as are the exposure options. And, of course, the face recognition is a great new development that Panasonic has implemented quite well in this camera.Now to it's video capabilities. It'll shoot 720p HD video in 16:9 which is awesome if you have a HD TV which is, of course, 16:9. Just be sure to turn off \"auto-focus\" when in video mode or the camera will constantly be 'hunting' for the right focus. It's depth of field is excellent so it'll be in focus most of the time anyway.Just a couple of nits. The low light assist lamp is not terribly effective (nowhere near as good as the one on my Sony DSC-V1) and the camera sometimes takes a second or two to find the right focus in low light. And I wish there was a way to more easily control/allow for long shutter exposures as I love night photography. As it is, you have to set the camera to \"Starry Night\" (one of the scene modes) to get shutter speeds longer than 1 second. Not that big a deal and  certainly a minor criticism of such an excellent overall camera.Oh, and one final thing...the build quality is superb.

I was originally going to buy the TZ3 for $249.99 and the day I was going to buy it I read an article that Panasonic was going to come out with the TZ5.I decided to wait a few weeks and read what I could regarding the quality of the new TZ5.  It took a few weeks but reviews started popping up online and I was able to see the features of the new camera verses the TZ3.  I decided to go ahead and spend the extra $50 dollars and purchase this camera.I am very pleased with the features of this camera.  I was looking for a small compact camera that was easy to use for my wife, but a large zoom for me.  Most point and shoot digital cameras have 3x or 4x zoom, this camera has a monster 10x zoom, which is great for my needs.  The camera stays relatively small so my wife can carry it around and with the Ai settings it makes it a very easy camera to use, which meets her needs.  I am also impressed with the photo quality of this camera.  There was one hang up though and I expected this so I knew what I was getting into - right out of the box I had to begin reading the instruction manual and adjusting the cameras settings to get the best picture quality.Pros.+ Small compact point and shoot with large 10x zoom+ HD video resolution (720p capture with component cable playback)+ Zoom while capturing video (option was not available in TZ3)+ Ai setting makes the camera easy for beginners, just turn it on and shoot.+ Large 3.0\" LCD display screen makes reviewing pictures easy (the TZ5 also has a higher resolution screen then the TZ3)+ 9.1 megapixel+ Able to take pictures in different aspect ratio's  4:3, 3:2, and 16:9Cons.- Picture review button has changed from the TZ3 model.  Now instead of easily hitting down on the 4 way directional pad you have to push a switch down to go into \"review mode\" to see the last picture you just took.  I found this a little slower than the TZ3 and one more moving part that can break.  For reference see the back of the TZ5 and notice the toggle switch from \"capture to review\" in the upper right hand corner.- If the camera is not set to Ai then taking a good picture straight out of the box might not be perfect.  You will want to spend a little time reading the manual and adjusting some settings to get a great photo.- Will only us SDHC memory cards.  Since I did not have a memory card this was not a problem for me, but if you are upgrading from an older camera you cannot use the old standard memory card.  The new SDHC cards are faster and it is suggested that you get a high speed card (transfer rate) in order to capture HD video.- ISO Images above 800 do have artifacts (static) in the image.  This does not make the photo horrible or bad looking just noticeable if you blow up the image to a large size such as an 8x10.  I knew this going in and most digital cameras have this problem, some worse.After owning this camera for over a month I am very pleased with it and couldn't be happier.  I hope this review helps and if you still need information or possibly some sample photos, then go to Google and type in \"review Panasonic TZ5\".

Even though there's no manual mode, there are enough available functions with the modes available that one can almost always get the shot one wants.  I agree with the advice to have 2 batteries because, if you're like me, you'll want to take it everywhere and frequently use it to take chance photographs which you may not have attempted with a camera less well configured than this one.  I also have an 8Gb extreme SDHC card and this allows plenty of opportunities to shoot short video clips (and be able to zoom whilst doing so) and not worry about running out of disc space if you just take photos for deleting later when you sort the wheat from the chaff!

There are several outstanding features about this camera that go beyond picture quality. While on vacation last spring- my first time out with the TZ5- we happened to see 4 horses running wild about a 1/2 mile away. From the hwy and going at about 60 mph, I was able to bounce the power up to 17x and catch several beautiful shots all in the space of as many seconds. So much for the comments about it being slow. Keep it in \"Sports\" mode with continuous frame advance when tinkering is not possible. Another feature is the incredible video. I never used video in any of my digital cameras before the TZ5. This has optical instead of digital zoom- now that's a little slow, otherwise you'd hear motor noise, and you do get some hesitation in focus, which is understandable as it is an optical zoom and is live focusing.Shortcomings...well, there is no manual focusing and no manual settings for exposure. That's where the Canon SX110 wins out, and the Canon SX110 all around is a faster shooter.The TZ5 is slim and trim and can fit in a man's pocket wih no problem. The Canon SX110 is not as compact.

Once you start taking shots with a field as wide as this camera offers, you'll wonder how you did without it. The 10x zoom is quite sharp and the iA feature keeps things from getting to noisy/blurry at the end of the lens. The buttons work great, the menu is easy (much like a Canon actually) and the build quality is very high. The screen is BRIGHT and SHARP and everyone will say WHOA! when they see the image.

From the time you click the button for your picture and the time the pic is actually taken was a bit slow but I havent adjusted any settings yet on my camera. I believe there is a setting for that on there though. In my opinion if you are trying to take quick pics from the beginning this camera is not for you. I have young kids and is very hard to take pics with them moving all the time. And when you take pictures there is a red light that shines in peoples face. Although you do have the advantage of panoramic pics and one touch click that takes several shots one after the other i think they would have to be preplanned before you take them. The camera was actually smaller than I thought it was which was a plus. Picture come out very clear which impressed me. This camera supports a 16 gb SD card which is nice as well.

The reason I made the purchase in the first place was to replace my old Canon SD200, which still works great, it's just old and the water housing was getting beat. I figured I would buy the Panasonic based on specs and the fact there would be an available water housing for it. When I did make the purchase, I was not able to get the water housing for it yet, I expected to wait a little while, but took the camera to the beach and took great surf shots from a distance using  the 10X optical zoom. The pictures turned out just OK, when zoomed in on them, I noticed they were a little grainy, (first gripe). I next took the camera to my kids school play which was in a dimly lit auditorium, suffice to say, this camera does not do well in low light and I didn't get some of the shots I wanted. I played with the settings but could not get this thing to cooperate. (second gripe) Finally, after having a couple of opportunities to try this out, HD Video included, I was not impressed and began to miss my little SD200. My three or four year old Canon was a lot faster, smaller, and took better pictures, so I decided that I didn't need 10X optical zoom (I wanted small to begin with) and that I sacrificed to many things to have 10X optical zoom and HD video and returned it, promptly going out and buying a Canon SD870 and a water housing the same day from my favorite little mom and pop camera shop down in Encinitas. My Canon blows the Panasonic away in all aspects. I also want to say, the Panasonic required a proprietary cable to hook up to the computer instead of your standard mini usb cable, which I found annoying.

Wide angle is great as well as the 10x optical zoom.I used a viewfinder with lines to assist in composition on my Nikon SLR and find this feature in the TZ5.

So if your hanging out in a restaurant or in some bar or anywhere where there is low light this camera takes really good pictures. Other cameras I have tried like Sony brands, the pictures came out to be all dark and gloomy without much focus and lots of dots showing up in the pictures from the lights.

I did quite a bit of research and narrowed it down to the Panasonic TX5 and a Sony Cybershot that was about the same price and had similar functions.  After reading several reviews and talking to a few \"experts\" at Best Buy and the like, 95% of my research recommended the Panasonic.  I ended up getting it for Christmas (yes, it was planned) and I couldn't be happier with it.  I take a lot of action shots.  I have dogs I love to photograph and with the older camera (and with my friends Sony), most of the pictures come up blurry because the dogs are running around so quickly.  With the TZ5, almost all of my shots come out crystal clear.  Furthermore, there are two burst features available I'll never be able to live without.  I live on the beach and take many pictures of waves.  The burst features allow me to hold down the button (I'm not a camera pro, obviously) and take literally dozens of pictures in mere seconds.  I get absolutely amazing shots of waves everytime I take my camera with me.  My only complaint with this camera is that it does NOT have a panoramic ability.  I used to take a lot of panoramics with my Kodak and loved them.  I never actually printed them because they're awkward and I don't have any appropriate frames so I can't say I'm devastated but I do miss them.

It's my 5th digital camera but only the first she's been enthusiastic about using.The one downside is the camera's weak ergonomics.  Perhaps because of the small overall size and the huge LCD on the back, there's basically no right way to hold it with just one hand.  Up front, the flash is positioned very close to the grip.  It's too easy to cover up accidentally with my fingers.  Around back, my thumb rubs against the menu button frequently, which forces the camera out of picture-taking mode until I exit the menu.  My hands are relatively small; I imagine it'd be worse for most adults.  The only solution is to hold the camera gingerly, with both hands.

I was looking for a very reliable point and shoot that was compact(could fit in my pants pocket) and had more than 3x zoom.  I spent a month researching the internet sites from CNET to Amazon to Bob's camera and visiting Best Buy.  I have an old Minolta DiMage 4x, 4MP.  Its bulk precludes taking it with me unnoticeably(geek factor), so I miss out on taking shots.  I liked the Sony 150 priced at $249.00(forgot name), and would have kept it if it had more zoom.  It was fast, compact and took great pictures.  Then, I looked at the compact 7X by Olympus.  Nice little camera, but when it came to handling, the Lumix was definitely more convenient.  You can hold the Lumix in your right hand and shoot simultaneously, so I bought the Lumix for about $50.00 more than the Sony 150.  It has a large LCD screen which is a must without a viewfinder (the viewfinder adds to the bulk of the camera and with a nice sized LCD it is essentially obsolete).  The Lumix has lots of options.  It takes great pictures, even at night with variable iso settings. I got some great shots of a fair at night with all the neon lites glowing.  It has a burst feature which has been present on digital cameras for years.  However, when not using the burst mode, Lumix is slow going from picture to picture in a rapid fashion.

I know the purists say you should have a dedicated movie camera if you are into shooting home video, but I find a good quality compact digital camera is much easier to carry around and less intimidating to your subjects when you're aiming it at them.  I have a Sony DSC t100 which is an awesome little camera, but it doesn't interface well with my Mac (no audio on movies), and I have to run the footage through Roxio program on my PC to convert to AVi, then copy the AVI files to my Mac.  Tedious and time-consuming.  I find Sony's proprietary memory stick to be annoying as well.  I also wanted to upgrade to a compact digital that shot movies in HD.  I like to use stills from my video footage in my finished IMovies and HD video allows for pretty good stills.  I loved so much about the DMC TZ5, but the it struggled to focus in low light and the  audio for my finished movies was very poor compared to the Sony.  You can really only hear the person shooting the footage clearly (if he/she avoids covering the poorly-located microphone with his/her left index finger), and you miss a lot of the dialogue of the subjects.  This is a huge flaw if you're doing home movies, since some of the best audio comes from side comments and reactions.  I used the camera for a few weeks and did some short films on my Mac, but I just couldn't get past the low volume of the audio track.  The microphone barely picks up audio more than a couple of feet away.  I did extensive research before buying it and did not see this issue mentioned anywhere, so I am afraid I will never know if the audio capabilities are up to my standards without trying the camera out first. The superb audio quality of my Sony may have spoiled me, but I had to send the Lumix back.", "Date": "September 24, 2008"}, {"Title": "A great product just need a few fine tuning", "Author": "Y. wang", "ReviewID": "R3HNSEM77T06MY", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "First let me clarify. I love this camera, Consider the size, the cost and the result. It is a great camera. the reason I give it 2 stars is because I think there are a few things the manufacturer can easily improve but they didn't.There are enough reviews tell you about the good things, so I am only going to focus on the negative points:* Why use Motion-JPG to record video? Not only the video file is ridiculously large, it also limits the max recording time(at 720p) to only about 10 minutes, that's way too short. Panasonic should definitely consider MP4 format. This is the single biggest issue I have with my TZ5.* The location of the Mic is not premium, it's on top of the camera where you usually put your left hand on, easily blocked by your fingers, they should move it to below the lens.* The quality of the sound recording is fairly poor, even at in-doors you hear enough noise, recording outside in windy condition is impossible.* Manufacturers should stop pumping up pixel count and really do some work on low light condition and noise control. The pictures produced by TZ3(which I also own) and TZ5 does not have much difference, it doesn't justify the 2M pixel increase.* In outdoor daylight the pictures are beautiful, but indoor low light condition is really a challenge for this camera, especially in video recording when you can't use flash.* Panasonic should consider switching Component output to HDMI. And include an HDMI cable in the package. Most mordern LCD TV doesn't have component input on the side or front. In my case it is particularly bad since my LCD TV is mounted on the wall, I can't reach the component input located at the back. RCA output from this TZ5 is pretty bad.* They should consider adding an accessory shoe to mount a video light.* Some button design is not premium, like the main dial on top  of the camera. I don't know why they put Scene1 and Scene2 between the Photo mode and Video mode. Photo and Video modes are the two most commonly used modes, others are barely used.* The Optical Stability system does work, but still not enough, most videos produced without tripod are still jitty. Especially when you view them on your big screen LCD TV. Although this is a tricky one, I am not sure how much panasonic(and other manufacturers) can improve on this area.* Optical zooming in video mode is too slow(well, better than TZ3 which can't use optical zoom during video mode), Focus while zooming(in video mode) is even worse.", "Date": "December 14, 2008"}, {"Title": "Buyer Beware", "Author": "S.

If you want to connect your TZ5 to your HDTV to watch great HD movie clips taken with this camera, you will need to buy an optional, $40 proprietary Panasonic component cable.The included cable only has one line VIDEO and one line AUDIO -- it will project a so-so, watchable video signal on your HDTV screen, but it will not be an HD quality.The 5-line, component cable is not included, and it costs $40! (WAAAAAAAY TO MUCH!!!)If you are lucky to have a card reader in your TV, or if you are going to burn these videos onto a DVD and play them with your Blue-Ray (I'm not even sure that's doable?) -- than I guess you don't need this component cable, and this review doesn't apply to you.So this is the reason for two stars.The HD VIDEO is one of the major selling points for this camera, but most people will have to pay at least $40 more to enjoy it.*update: just read in the camera's manual that TV with a card reader will only play still pictures, so I guess that option for HD video is out.  :(*another update: paid my $40 for that DMW-HDC2 component cable.Video and especially still pictures look great on my 42-incher Toshiba! Awesome! Much better than the supplied cable (the one with one line VIDEO and one AUDIO).But again I am disappointed. That $40 Panasonic component cable is only 2m (6.5ft) long. Which means that even in that claustrophobic closet I call my apartment, the cable is not long enough for me to comfortably sit on the sofa and hold the camera connected to the TV. After I connect the cable to the back of the TV and swing it around in front, it only extends about 5ft from the TV screen. :(So now I have to find an extension component cable! I don't see any 5-line male-to-female cables here on Amazon, meaning that I will probably have to get a male-to-male cable and a coupler! It's going to run me another $20-25+!To comfortably sit in front of my TV and project pictures and video in high definition will now cost me $60+! I did not know that before buying the camera.

Barrett (http://www.wdbarrett.com)...", "ReviewID": "R1DIE7EEZWF8V2", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "UPDATE:  The camera actually takes some very good pictures.  The automatic mode uses \"scene settings\" to determine the appropriate mode.  The default mode uses an aperture priority and adjusts the shutter speed for exposure.  There is an action scene that uses shutter priority and adjusts the aperture for exposure.  The landscape mode is smart enough to shut off the fill flash, open the aperture, and adjust the shutter speed for exposure.  The trick is picking the right scene.  Sometimes, it is easier to put it into manual mode and manually adjust the shutter speed, aperture, and flash.I have decided to keep the camera.  The Li-ion battery lasts longer than my older camera that uses rechargeable NiMH AA batteries.  I will eventually have to buy a spare battery for convenience.  I hope there is a NiMH spare battery available.  The reason is that Li-ion batteries only last 1 to 2 years, so it will need to be replaced.  The NiMH battery is for backup only, but will last a long time.Hopefully, when I am ready to replace the camera, there will be one that can charge as easily as my cell phone.ORIGINAL REVIEW:The camera has some great features for the price.  I bought this for the wide angle lens (an absolute must for me) and the 10x optical zoom.  The picture quality is respectable.  The fill flash works better than expected.  The light reaches beyond 12 feet, which is all you can expect from a camera like this.  The 3\" LCD is larger than most, but still too small to really get a true feeling of the picture quality.  You really do not see the picture quality until you upload to a PC or print it out.  The picture stabilization feature is okay but does not work all that great or at least as good as it is hyped up to be.There are a few shortcomings:1.  The lack of a viewfinder makes it more difficult to frame pictures.  I would gladly have sacrificed the LCD size to have a viewfinder.2.  The USB connection does not charge the battery.  This seems to be the norm, probably due to the required charging current.3.  The charger that came with the camera requires the proprietary Li-ion battery to be removed from the camera.  What were they thinking?4.  The camera is a bit heavy for its size.  I guess I could attribute that to the 10x optical zoom and the extra metal to make it happen.I have only had the camera a very short time.  I have not completely explored all of its capabilities.  However, I am contemplating returning the camera and getting one that has been designed the way I want to use it.  I am also considering getting one that uses AA batteries.  If I have to remove the battery to recharge, why not have a phone that uses standard batteries?  That way, I can at least use AA alkalines while recharging NiMH batteries.", "Date": "February 28, 2009"}, {"Title": "Great Camera", "Author": "Shahin Razavi \"Shadoggy\"", "ReviewID": "R18ZPM7LQTFOJM", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I am still trying to figure out the features of this camera.

The camera fell onto the ground from about 1' high and it took me 30 minutes of shaking and manually pushing the parts of the lens cover back and forth until it finally recovered and worked again.On a recent trip to the Southwest (which was admittedly brutal with rocks and sand) the lens cover finally failed for good. Repairs are $160 flat, unless it was impact damage, sand damage, etc., which is the case here. Essentially I can get a new camera for the cost of the repair.I have decided to keep my trusted, super robust Canon Powershot S50 for situations where I feel a more rugged camera would be good and not sure what to do about the Panasonic, yet.Other issues:The packaged software Panorama Maker 4 is unsuitable for newer Intel Macs and Panasonic and the maker of the software both deny any support responsibility. The USB connectivity reports the camera as \"NO NAME\" which looks pretty cheap. Triggering a shot through the USB cable is not possible. I am comparing this to my Canon Powershot S50 which is much more mature in this regard.

Husch", "ReviewID": "R2FRIERWVN3GPI", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "The main reason for getting a camera with a 10x zoom is to take pictures of birds and wildlife from faraway.  Often when you see that lovely bird you only have 3 seconds until she turns and flys away.  So its really critical that everything about the camera aid to getting the perfect shot quickly.I found everything about the TZ5 to be slow.  Power on 2 secs, Power off 1.5 secs.  Power on, zoom to 10x, focus, shoot about 8 seconds.  Time between photos 2 seconds, time between flash photos 6 seconds.On the top is an options ring to select photo, video, or special photo modes.  If you are storing the camera in your pocket, its easy for this ring to turn.  So next time you turn the camera on and are ready to photgraph that perfect eagle with winds spread, and just get the message, \"dial is in wrong position\".  A similar problem occurs with the record/playback switch.  If you forgot to leave the camera in record mode, there is another 10 seconds while our beautiful eagle is flying away.Yes i recently went on a trip, and i saw a lot of beautiful birds, but i missed literally 60% of the good shots due to these design issues.An SLR camera such as the Canon Digital Rebel EOS would be good for getting fast response.Another point is that this camera has an externally telescoping lens.  This is a big reason for the delays in powering up and down as the lens has to pop out and in each time, which also consumes significant battery power.  My previous camera, Sony Cybershot DSCT300, had a fully internal lens system, and it could take the first picture in 1 second.  On our tourbus we went sandboarding and everyone got covered with sand, and sand in all the pockets.  Almost everyperson who had an external lens (including my tz5) had malfunctions with the lens system after.

I kept it for a year, just to give it a fair chance.  For that year, I compared its pictures to those taken by my 2 Sony point and shoot cameras on automatic mode.  There is no comparison.  Here are the problems with this camera:1) The 'brains' aren't intelligent.  It takes daylight pictures too slow, opting for a broader focal distance.  For example, on auto mode, a picture of a jugler at a fair in full daylight renders the juglers hands and pins blurry.  The pictures are too slow to stop most motion.  In program mode, the only adjustment you can make which will render a faster picture is to increase the ISO.  More to come on that.2)  Its autoexposure isn't particularly intelligent either.  It doesn't recogize backlight.  You can manually adjust the exposure compensation if your subject is still available.3)  The flash produces washed-out, flat, bluish pictures.4)  Pictures start showing graininess at ISO 200 or below.  They become unacceptable at 400.  So bumping up the ISO to force a faster picture isn't a very good answer.5)  The flash unit is not in the center of the camera.  I put my fingers over the flash about half of the time.I have replaced the camera with a Sony DSC-H50.  It has a lovely zoom and is fully configurable.  It is bigger and not so easy to carry, but rewards me with great pictures nearly every time - even in fully automatic mode.", "Date": "September 26, 2008"}, {"Title": "Dissappointed", "Author": "customer123 \"customer123\"", "ReviewID": "R2AZGWPGDISVQQ", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I was very excited to purchase this camera based on all the excellent reviews.  However, the camera performed much worse than our old digital Cannon purchased 5 years before.  Cannon always took sharp images and recording movies was not a problem.  Lumix constantly underperformed; it was very hard to take a sharp image--the majority of them would come out grainy, no matter what was the lighting.  I've tried to adjust the settings but nothing worked.  Could not figure out how to record movies either--they came out as a still photo.  Maybe I've missed something, but it shouldn't be so difficult and require you to look into the manual.  On Cannon you just switched to the movie mode and voila, everything worked.  Here, although it would appear that the movie was being recorded, no movie was actually recorded.  I am actually happy that it finally broke and now we have to buy a new one.

The main reason I waited for this camera was to have the option at better quality video, with the functionality of a P&S; camera.  It's quite large for a P&S;, and frankly, there are other cameras out there with as good, if not better PQ in a smaller package.  As far as the camera functionality, not much different that the TZ3.

Unfortunately, the problems with this camera aren't immeadiately apparent.  The problems are deep seated form-factor and software issues that become constant annoyances farther down the road.Problems:1) Buttons are awkwardly located, making it easy to accidentally press the wrong button.2) Power options for extending battery life are non-existent - the camera simply runs until it dies (without much advance notice).3) On-camera menus are not intuitive.4) Movies are in the quicktime format - nothing plays quicktime except intrusive Apple software.5) Pictures are NOT auto-rotated in windows.  You have to use panasonic's \"special\" software, or otherwise rotate all pictures by hand.6) Tech support is snotty and unhelpful.The first problem we noticed with the camera was the awkward positioning of buttons and dials.  Both of us are always pressing the wrong button by accident when trying to take a picture.  With the menu and navigation buttons right next to where you place your thumb, it is easy to accidentally enable some random feature that we wouldn't otherwise ever use.  For me, this problem is especially apparent when taking vertical pictures.The second problem is the lack of power save options.  When travelling, a power plug is not always available, so it is convenient to turn off power hungry features such as the display when you don't need them.  Although the battery does last a long time, and the power problem could be rectified by plugging the camera in every night, it is easy to forget.  With our previous camera, we could disable the screen when we had forgotten to plug in the camera so we could still take pictures all day on low power.  This camera, however, doesn't have that option.  Furthermore, it doesn't alert somebody to its lack of power until it has maybe 10 minutes remaining... and then off it goes (at noon on the most picturesque day of the trip).The third problem is a minor annoyance.  We are always struggling to find the right options in the menu.  Maybe the features are there, or maybe they aren't... but the menus are crazy.The fourth problem has to do with Panasonic's use of the Quicktime movie format.  We really wanted a new camera so that we could take movies of our 1-year daughter.  Unfortunately, all of the cute movies we've recorded are only viewable in Apple's Quicktime.  They aren't convertable to any other viewer either.  I don't know about other people's experience with Quicktime, but it either crashes my computer outright or hogs processing and network time, preventing other software from running.  The result is that we can't watch all of these cute movies we've recorded.The fifth problem is the auto-rotate feature.  The camera has an auto-rotate, right?  It is advertised as having one.... too bad they don't use it to rotate the pictures.  Instead, they set some software bit in each image that is only readable by the panasonic software.  If I want to show pictures to a friend, I have to either rotate everything by hand in windows beforehand, or try to navigate panasonic's clunky, poorly designed software.Finally, the last problem is with the panasonic tech support.  I've contacted them three times, and only received an answer once.  And that one time (in reference to the Quicktime problems), they simply told me tough... rather than trying to help me work around the issue, or giving me any contact info from apple or...The DMC-TZ5 camera \"seems\" ok at first glance, but the design and software issues associated with with the camera make the experience overwhelmingly negative in the long run.
