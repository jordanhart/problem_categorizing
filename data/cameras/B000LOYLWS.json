One drawback is that it will not accept SDHC cards just the standard SD. Having said that, it will take a 4gb SD card. More than enough for hundreds of pictures. The screen is clear and the controls are easy to use. As for picture quality, it is excellent. This model has been upgraded to the S1050. Not much difference except that that camera takes SDHC", "Date": "January 3, 2010"}, {"Title": "battery eater", "Author": "Heather", "ReviewID": "R1ZF1WYTR5RDUT", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "the camera is good, but it goes through batteries very fast, I would get rechargeable ones if you get this camera.
