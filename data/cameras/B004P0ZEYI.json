But at this price ($319 as of this writing), this is as big a no-brainer as it gets. They faithfully reproduce whatever is fed into them.  Beautifully smooth response from the deep punchy bass (though this is not a \"bass-head\" earphone), through the lovely mids, and crisp highs.  Be warned, if your source is poor quality, it will be glaringly apparent through these.  Depending on the source, I love to listen to these \"flat\" (no equalization), but they take equalization well.  There might be some who don't care for the crispness of the highs .... I was a bit concerned at first listen.  After maybe 10 hours though, they sound perfect --- either from the 10 hr \"burn-in\" or acclimation -- whatever the case may be.  Listening to any of my other earphones after this one makes them sound flat and dull by comparison.  This is a FUN sound.", "Date": "May 16, 2012"}, {"Title": "Excellent, Excellent earphone", "Author": "L. Topper", "ReviewID": "RP22UZ1EIHM9U", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "These are unusual earphones.  They appear to be exceptionally well built.  They have a swivel piece construction so that they will easily swing into position with the wire coming from behind and over the ear.  The right earpiece has a red mark so that it is easy to tell right from left.  The box that the earphones are stored in is bigger than necessary, but plush and well thought out.  The case appears to be like a box for a pearl necklace and feels like leather (or pleather).  The inside looks like felt (but is not felt) and the wires wind up on the edge of the inside tray (removable) that holds the earphones.  So, there is a place to wind the cord and another separate space for each earphone to lay flat.  The cord appears to unscrew, so it could be replaced.  The driver is actually quite large and is offset so that it stays outside your ear and totally out of the way. It don't find that cords to be microphonic which is a plus.  Moreover, the cords appear to be of big enough gauge that they do not easily tangle.The price is certainly steep, but there are plenty of opportunities to get it at reasonable prices.  I have seen it under $400.00 as on Amazon today or up to $650.00 (Audio Cubes which imports directly from Japan).The sound on these earphones really reveals the quality of the recording.  I listen to classical and jazz mostly.  It is acoustic music without excessive amplification, but benefits from a recording engineer that is an artist.  These earphones convey a sense of space as long as the recording includes this in the sound picture.  The bass is not exaggerated.  It makes the bass a \"team player\" rather than the center of attention.  If you want BIG bass, then Sennheiser is a better choice.  I like the \"neutral\" sound and I like BIG BASS, so i have both.  However, I am now listening to a recording where the upright string bass is emphasized and these earphones certainly emphasizes the bass.  These earphones reveal what is there on the recording.The sound quality is wonderful.  These earphones have a very big sound.  It is like having over the ear headphones.  It is not a question of loudness, but more an issue of a big, full sound.  These earphones really have it.In short, this is really a wonderful earphone.  When I listened to a very good, clear recording, but without any sense of separation of the instruments, the recording sounded like the instruments were played in the same space.  When the recording sounded like the instruments may have had some separation in the studio, you got the sense of the instruments being in their own space.  In short, the earphones appear to be very revealing.Lastly, I have to say that when listening to music to write this review, I used an Ipod with music ripped from the disc on the \"loss-less\" setting and with a Fostex HP P-1 which is a combination Ipod transport, DAC, and headphone amplifier.  So I had the benefit of excellent audio equipment to maximize the quality of the signal.Post-Script:  I listened to these earphones today using the Algorhythm Solo DAC/Ipod transport and the the ALO Continental Two.  This allows me to move around freely listening to music at the with resolution that is wonderful.  The ALO Continental is a hybrid amp that has a tube buffer.  The amplifier has far more power than is necessary to run these earphones, but the depth of sound, separation of instruments, and just quality sound were just fabulous.I cannot recommend these earphones more highly. For many people, this pair could be the best earphones that they have ever owned. I believe that they compare favorably to the Westone 3, the Shure 530 or 535, and the Sennheiser IE8.", "Date": "May 5, 2012"}, {"Title": "Still the IEM reference from Sony", "Author": "Erwin Opsch", "ReviewID": "R3L2I51KBTEUJ8", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "To make it short:This are no phones for cycling or running outside, windnoise is a problem as long you don't wear a cap or something.BUTThe overall sound quality is amazing, far better soundstaging than every BA multiway IEM (even reference types around 1000 $).Very natural and fresh sounding, with well a balanced sound signature.A dream for indoor sports or home listening.Is it worth the money? For me: Yes, sure. No doubt, if you like flawless Hifi, they are worth every penny.If you do a lot of outdoor activities, go for closed types and or BAs. But you hardly find this level that reminds me to a Beyerdynamic T1 or Sennheiser HD600.A shame, Sony stopped production and introduced new 4 way BA instead of the dynamic fullrange inear. To be honest, the XBA4 is crappy and 5 leagues lower than the EX1000.

The 1000s stand alone. Comparing them to Sony's previous flagship, the EX700's, the 1000s feature more pronounced bass response while keeping it perfectly tight and accurate. The sibilance that was also an issue with the 700s is now a thing of the past, while keeping the soundstage airy and open. Sony's various earbud lines are now in every way surpassed.The fit and finish is quite nice. The ear hooks are made of a bendable memory material and I usually readjust them when I first put them on at the start of a day. The body of the driver units is magnesium alloy all around, the cords that attach to the housings are replaceable (and are held in place with a secure bolting system, I have no worry about these unlike the clip system on Shures), there are 10 sizes of silicone earbud supplied for the ideal seal (ML for me), and there's a custom leather case included for long term storage, though the units are hardy enough that I feel completely comfortable stuffing them in my pocket. I also find them substantially more comfortable than their predecessors, the EX700s. They're incredible light, and with the proper size earbud in place and the hooks correctly adjusted, it's easy to forget you're wearing them.To me the issue isn't the quality as that is undisputed, but whether they are worth the asking price, which is not something I can answer. As an employee of a relevant major electronics manufacturer, I paid about half the MSRP for these, and I feel I've come out ahead. These surpass the performance of most of my 200+ dollar supra-aural headphones.These have started to come down to to the mid-300s like most other premium earbuds, and at this range, there's a lot of competition. The Sennhesier IE8's are the only others I personally prefer, but they're all superb; you really need to listen for yourself and gauge the unique sound signitures. For me, these are what I most prefer; punchy bass and buoyant vocals. Check the return policies of various sites and try them out for yourself.I can also confirm a previous reviewer's comments that these earbuds ship with just a 3 month warranty, which I find quite puzzling for a company's \"flagship\" product. I ended up getting a 2 year enhanced physical damage warranty through Sony (about 50 bucks) so I consider this irrelevant to myself, but people buying blind should know.", "Date": "August 24, 2011"}, {"Title": "these earbuds definitely live up to the flagship Sony product posiiton", "Author": "Shaoyou Wang", "ReviewID": "R25E2S8URH8BCF", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "balanced, matured tune Technic, clear and very detailed sound, solid and bouncy bass but definitely not excess, it will feed your ear with all the amazing sounds that you have been looking for a while.

A treat to the ears.", "Author": "Bart", "ReviewID": "R18ZDBAUNQAVAW", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Bottom line; I am very pleased. Based on the reviews I read--both positive and negative--at Amazon and elsewhere--the MDREX1000 is everything I had hoped they were. Ironically, some of the negative comments regarding \"low bass\" and \"poor isolation\" and \"harsh (exaggerated) highs\" actually influenced my decision to buy. Reports of exaggerated highs on a single driver design was the clincher for me. Reading between the lines of some of the comments, coupled with my past experiences and my research into the design of these headphones, I was sure these headphones were the ones for me. Now after a month of using them I can say I was right. Five stars! I put the \"bottom-line\" at the top of my review. If you want detail--TMI for some, read on.I have used and tested many different kinds of headphones--but not recently. I bought these specifically for use on stage as IEM (In-Ear-Monitors). two months earlier I picked up the Sony MDR-EX700LP for general music listening and was shocked at the great sound. I studied the design of them. Two things I found intriguing: 1)the single driver design and 2)the vented design. Many years earlier I had wondered about these two. I know a thing or two about sound and speaker design. I had grown accustomed to the multi-driver headphones with high isolation (sealed). I found these headphones disappointing and began to think a single-driver vented design would be better--at least for me.  This I thought in spite of the fact that most every cheap trash headphone on the market is the single-driver, vented type.I understand the need for woofers and tweeters in a speaker and I am well aware of the problems of time and phase shift inherit in these designs. But in the case of the tiny drivers found in headphones it seemed to me to be entirely unnecessary to use multiple drivers. The time and phase shift problems could be eliminated with the tiny dimensions. Seemed to me a single driver had the advantage with the right design. (Now, years later, I learn this topic has much discussion and debate in the forums and Sony has put some very capable engineers on it.)In a similar way I thought it was counter-productive to completely seal off the ear in order to gain high isolation. Everyone's anatomy is different. The custom molds help but the ear canal is simply not stable enough to design to. For some people the isolation is the number one concern. For me, high-fidelity is priority one. Another thing that bugs me is I find it difficult to sing with my ears plugged. When you couple this plugged-ear effect with the latency of a digital monitor system, you get a comb filter effect which destroys the sound. So it seemed to me a vented design would solve several problems for me.The EX700 was proof to me that it was possible. I decided to look for a headphone similar to the EX700 that fits over the top of the ear [like an IEM] and that is when I discovered the EX1000 and researched it. Reports on the bass response varied wildly and I endured a lot of negative reviews. I had the EX700 and that helped me stay positive. I found some reviews which directly compared EX1000 to the EX700. That helped a lot but no review I read properly accounted for \"loudness\" when rating frequency response. This seems to be a forgotten principle. What one perceives as flat frequency response will vary depending on the overall loudness. Some may remember the \"loudness compensation\" button coupled with the volume control on an analog stereo. This was supposed to compensate for human perception. Research it.Because of the above principle, people that listen to headphones at a low level will naturally prefer more bass than someone who likes it loud. For general listening I like it at a low or medium level. On stage I have the headphones up very loud. Human hearing has an automatic level control to protect your hearing. My listening level is right at the threshold it kicks in--very loud. At that level the bass response of the EX700 is too much (painful) and the EX1000 is perfect. Bass is politely monsterous and yet it does not obscure the clarity of the upper bass and midrange. This combination of range and clarity at high levels is rare. This means low intermodulation distortion at high levels--rare indeed.Even at lower levels the bass is a treat. It effortlessly reaches the lowest extreme frequencies without hammering your ears with mid mass. Many have heard this effect with a well tuned subwoofer but a subwoofer has the side-effect of causing the bass to seem sort-of \"disconnected\" from the rest of the sound. The perfectly time and phase aligned bass [that the Sony 16mm single driver provides] is pure delight.Contrary to many negative reviews, the highs are not exaggerated or harsh to me--even at high levels. In fact, the entire response curve is precisely where I want it. For the first time I can dispense with the equalizer for my IEM.Compared to a real IEM headphone, the large black things in the ears are not a pleasant sight. They are not as comfortable or secure. At times I miss the isolation more than I thought I would. These are all trade-offs I can live with. Until they make a real IEM with this level of performance, I'm sticking with the EX1000.", "Date": "October 2, 2012"}, {"Title": "Sound great on music.

It gives me a whole new music world, that it perfectly matches all kinds of music.

As both IE7 and EXK is moving coil, I just compare them a little.Well, the most important reason that I purchased it because of the price.
