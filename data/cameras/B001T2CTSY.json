{"Reviews": [{"Title": "UNLESS YOU REQUIRE A TRULY TELEPHOTO LENS AND BILL BOARD SIZED PRINTS THIS IS FAR MORE CAMERA THAN YOU WILL NEED", "Author": "C. Scanlon \"least helpful reviewer\"", "ReviewID": "R3R6JHPYBDEYFG", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This is a professional camera capable of crystal clear prints worthy of publication or gallery display, up to 16x20.And it is incredibly inexpensive for a camera of such value.Ok, so its 3.6 optical zoom won't pick sand off an eagle's beak at a thousand yards. Okay, so it won't blow up to billboard size without loss of definition. In the real world however and everyday use this is a fine and professional level camera that will do a far better job than you expected. Better than a cell-phone.Disguised as a point and shoot. That's what makes it very effective; people are not intimidated by it. You can get right up to them, and it looks like any other camera. Yet, it is more.In fact, the generous three inch LCD screen means you do not have to hold it to your face. There is no optical viewfinder in any case. So you can hold it at your hip and glance down at it to compose, and snap shots while engaging the subject in small talk comfortably. I have done this effectively with Tarahumara Indian children in northern Chihuahua who normally run quickly from any camera. It works, and came out great. And that large LCD screen has a high-contrast, anti-reflection coating which keeps it clear even in strong sunlight.This camera is an improvement over the earlier, wonderful Coolpix, such as the great 8 megapix Nikon Coolpix L18 8MP Digital Camera with 3x Optical Zoom (Ruby Red) mainly because it has ten megapix capability. The earlier accessories such as the AC adapter, the  Nikon EH-65A AC Adapter, are transferable if you have a long shoot to do in one place (like a schoolful of children, which I have done) or other reason to go off-battery. Nevertheless, a pair of Energizer\u00ae e<sup>2</sup>\u00ae \"AA\" Lithium Batteries For digital cameras, portable audio players, and more last in here last forever.Your old Coolpix camera pouch also still fits; use it and protect your investment. I like the Rokinon Compact Digital Camera Padded Carrying Case for Canon Powershot, Casio Exilim, Fuji Finepix, (GE) General Electric, Kodak EasyShare, Nikon Coolpix, Olympus FE Stylus, Panasonic Lumix, Pentax Optio, Sony CyberShot and Samsung Digital Cameras.Also new here, aside from the greater megapixels, is the new Expeed image processing system specially fine-tuned for the Coolpix series \"to render natural-looking pictures of incredible quality and quick response\" as if the earlier system of digital processing was not fine enough! Amateur enthusiasts will find their photos reaching a new magnitude of quality; even the professional will leave his camera bag and lenses at home (okay, so she might miss her long lens, but macro here gets in to two inches).The ISO settings are phenomenal, stretching from 64 ISO all  the way out to 1600. Over twenty years ago when I was doing photo-journalism in Nicaragua, we used 64 for our slide film and 1600 was just coming on the horizon, very grainy but with a special charm for low light situations, like oil lamp, etc. Here you can do very low light and candlelight  (if you do not mind some grain effect), and in fact there are special pre-sets which employ the faster ISO's effectively.This is another expansion over the prior Coolpix L series. You can choose instead of Auto (with own its user-selected options) to use the pre-set \"Scene\" selections quickly and efficiently. The Scene modes now include: Portrait, Night Portrait, Sports, Landscape, Party, Beach/Snow, Sunset, Dusk/Dawn, Night Landscape, Museum, Fireworks Show, Close Up, Copy, Back Light, Panorama Assist, Food. Food is one of the new ones, and you food photo-journalists might want to try it very inexpensively yet quite well here. The rest of the modes you can figure how they are set from the title and how you might apply their settings to similar situations; know that the Nikon impression of party might be much more sedate and candle-lit than the Animal House idea. This is not cheating, to use pre-sets; this is using the tool that you have in the way it was designed. Cheating would be setting this to its auto-scene setting in which it selects the Scene mode according to prevailing conditions, automatically. Yes, this can do it.The panorama assist is great. You can take a series of photos in a row in either of four directions (left to right, up and down, etc.) overlapping by one third (I really appreciate the rule of thirds grid which you can bring up on the LCD, keeping the camera straight and well composed), and then unite them with the included software into one long (or tall) file. I had reason to do this the other day at a long new school. Things do not build vertical out here in the desert, but there is plenty of room for horizontal, and a special Cinerama style long photo framing. In fact you could line up your whole town along the sidewalk standing and take one long photo of everyone in town. Just find printer and paper!With the built in macro mode you can jump right into that cactus blossom from two inches away and have perfect focus. Take a photo of that baby's toes and blow them up to 16x20. Come in close to that ant stealing cracker crumbs on your picnic. This strength of macro was recently unimaginable, and yet here you have this power within a humble, tiny and inexpensive package.What I really love and appreciate is the SDHC compliancy. I can use as standard memory card a regular Sandisk 4GB Secure Digital SD HC Memory Card (SDSDB-4096, BULK, No Reader) and have room for 500 shots at maximum resolution. You can truly, as we used to say a quarter century ago \"shoot a roll; keep a shot.\"  Take all of the shots you can, and then pick one out to use and delete the rest. For someone who used to burn through boxes of film (at 36 shots each max) and then do the darkroom processing all night, and then find a free way to get more, this is like living in another, finer dimension. Of course, you can put even larger SD HC memory cards in here and if you ever do fill one up and have nothing more to put in there and no time to delete, this camera comes with a generous 20MB internal memory on hand.You can hook it up to the USB port of a computer directly and use the included software, or simply pop out the SD card and plug it into a reader and into the computer. Whatever works for you, although I do not like opening and closing the battery/card hatch too much. It is very strong and durable, but in the olden days I had a habit of snapping such things and putting them back together with duct tape. This one looks remarkably resilient nevertheless and has stood up to me.Speaking of shooting a roll to get the one picture, have you ever taken a shot to discover your subject blinked? This camera lets you know. Yes, this camera sees when your subject blinks, and lets you know, using the Smart Portrait system. It also automatically fixes your red-eye special. You'll never see red eye again. It finds faces, and automatically focuses on them, up to a dozen at a time. It can also snap the shutter automatically when someone finally dares to smile. And the D-lighting will save those details otherwise lost in darkness.As you can see, this camera does everything for you but serve as photo agency selling your work to Vogue or GQ. A great camera at a small price. What can go wrong?The most amazing thing for me, of course, an old still shooter, is that this tiny camera is also a video camera, with built in mike, and a built in speaker for playback. You can make movies with this at two different resolutions, either for television playback at 640x480 or laptop at 320x240 (good for e-mailing). These home movies are truly sharp, with the same excellent back to front focus as the photos, and surprisingly high quality sound. The length of the movie is limited only to the size of your SDHC card; you could easily go for feature length! Using .AVI files, it can easily be edited as well.Hey, for the same price, this is way better than a cell phone!", "Date": "April 8, 2009"}, {"Title": "A Great Little Camera", "Author": "carlitos_92", "ReviewID": "RFITEYT3LBVH6", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I bought this camera based on past experiences with Coolpix cameras, and the L20 carries most of what I've liked into the 10-megapixel line.  Some pros and cons:* The use of normal AA batteries is probably the best feature of this camera.  It keeps the L20 from being a super-slim, sexy piece of jewelry, but the importance of being able to keep inexpensive spare batteries around, or of being able to just run into a drugstore and buy more batteries in a pinch, is not to be underestimated.  I usually use NiMH rechargeables (Kodak brand at the moment, but I have also used Energizer) and have had no problems with the camera.* The easy-auto mode of the camera pretty much does all the thinking for you.  Occasionally, I will switch to macro mode or the scene used for backlit objects, but other than that, it's strictly point-and-shoot.* Low-light pictures come out grainier than I would like, but that is to be expected with this level of product.* My biggest gripe is that Nikon decided to put the SD card slot behind the battery door.  I believe they did this to cut down the number of breakable doors on the camera, but I much preferred being able to easily get to the SD card, since I have readers in my PC and laptop.  I have almost never used the supplied USB cables for image transfer.  Since the battery door is a bit balky, I am afraid that since I'm going to be going in there a lot for the SD card, it is prone to break even more than a standalone door would be.  This is not a deal-breaker, but I think Nikon took a step backward.All in all, I am pleased with Amazon's pricing and service, as usual.  The Nikon L20 is a great little camera.", "Date": "September 20, 2009"}, {"Title": "Nikon Coolpix L20: a good point-&-shoot camera", "Author": "R.

I didn't have time to do a lot of research, I just needed another camera.

I was able to sort by price, read comments, and order with 1-day delivery.  Our camera arrived less than 12 hours before our flight departed and I'm thrilled to say that the camera performed beautifully, right out of the box.Loved the \"easy auto\" settings, as well as the ability to switch to more manual-style controls to account for sunsets, water glare, overcast skies, etc.  The only bad photos out of the batch were the ones when someone stepped into the frame!We're pretty camera-savvy, so I didn't install the software.  Instead, we simply pop out the memory card and use the slot on our laptop to download photos.One note:  I probably missed this in my haste, but since this camera comes with internal memory, the package does not include an SD card.  Luckily for us, we had a 2 GB card from our deceased camera and were able to reformat it for the Nikon.Bottom line:  a great value, excellent photos, easy to carry in a jeans pocket, and lightening-fast delivery thanks to Amazon!

At 8x10 in size they were the equal of anything I ever got from film cameras.It's small size made it an easy fit in the side pocket of the jacket I was wearing.The included software featured a \"stitching\" program so I tried that out and was very pleased with the panoramic shots I got of the Seattle downtown and shoreline.The camera did not include an SD card, but I knew that when I bought it.

Kids...That impressed me so I bought the same Coolpix L20 for myself to use on long distance bicycle trips as well as supplementing our family digital camera. I too was able to learn its method of operation with minimal assistance from the users manual and even found some great features which the 9 year old hasn't yet discovered. The idea was for us to have the same camera so we could teach each other how best to use it.I've used my Coolpix L20 now for a month and really love it's simplicity and ease of use, even taking videos. Its 10 MP chip provides plenty of data with which to edit and store great pictures. However, the delay in acquiring data to the memory card makes taking action shots such as sporting events nearly impossible. You will get blured pictures 90% of the time. Acquiring jpegs to your desk top is simple once you load the Nikon software. Be sure to temporarily disable the anti virus software first. Best of all, the Coolpix L20 is lightweight and easily stores in your pocket and I like the fact that it runs on AA batteries. And I was amazed at how inexpensive it was.

The size is very nice; small but still easy to hold and operate.

The large viewing screen on the back is nice.  The first indoor photos on Easy Auto Mode didn't look that great, but regular Auto Mode worked much better. The flash seems okay; doesn't washout too much at close range, but the range seems fairly limited. The flash is certainly better than my 3 year old Lumix. The panorama function works fine.A few minor personal quibbles: I'd prefer the main mode settings being on a dial rather than a pop up menu, and I'd prefer not having the flash card & batteries under the same access cover.For an entry level camera is seems great, and for the price it seems an amazingly good value.", "Date": "December 10, 2009"}, {"Title": "Review", "Author": "S. venugopal \"SV\"", "ReviewID": "R12N2MMQJSLI3Y", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "This camera is worth for the money I paid.
