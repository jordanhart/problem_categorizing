I didn't want to get them Fisher Price cameras as they seemed geared to younger children and the cameras seemed big.  I have had many cameras through the years and my older children have had cameras and we have never had a camera break so quickly.  We looked at reviews on Amazon.  This camera was our pick as several reviewers had purchased them for children.  (The fact that it is pink also helped.)  My 7 yr old's lens jammed after about 3 days and my 8 yr old dropped hers on about day 5.  I managed to get the lens unjammed but it wouldn't work and after only one drop on concrete the other one was dead.  My girls were so disappointed, they had so much fun taking pictures and videos.  My husband was not so happy either that they broke two brand new camera.  So, if you are buying these for children I would look elsewhere.", "Date": "July 15, 2009"}, {"Title": "Polaroid i735 - Great little camera", "Author": "L.

One for me and two were gifts; one to my 27 year old daughter, one to my 80 year old mom.  None of the cameras lasted more than a couple of months.  All three broke.  But they each had something different wrong with them.  The view finder screen on mine turned black on the second picture and froze, my daughter's camera wouldn't turn on after about three weeks (new batteries didn't help), my mother's camera worked longest - then the screen turned blue.The cameras weren't mistreated they just are pieces of garbage that never should have been sold at any price.  The one I kept for myself took exactly two pictures and then the camera froze never to be used again.

I have had this camera for a few months now and the battery power keeps getting worse and worse. Now i can take about 5 pictures before my brand new battery is already half way empty and by the 10th picture it shuts off on its own. Sometimes if i wait about ten minutes and turn it back on i can take about 5 more pictures before the battery dies again. It is not worth the aggravation. I tried rechargeable batteries as well but i do not have time to sit and wait a hour just to take ten pics and have the camera die on me again. Save your money and buy a camera that does not suck batteries dry every 10 minutes!", "Date": "August 25, 2009"}, {"Title": "So awesome that we have 2!", "Author": "D. Jackson \"WriterMom\"", "ReviewID": "R1M9YEQ9HXYAON", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I got my daughter one of those overpriced kids cameras by VTECH and when 2 of them did not work, I got on Amazon in January and found a \"real\" camera with a comparable price. My super expensive slim Nikon I had took a spill and stopped working, so I got online and ordered another one of these in the interim. Of course it is slower than the camera I had before, but the pics turn out great and the 7 mp are good enough. Who needs a 10 anyway? Unless they are a pro. But, I don't know if I am going to rush to get the Nikon fixed b/c I am satisfied with this one for now. When we got hers in January it came with a camera case. When I got mine in July mine came with a clear snug sleeve that keeps it from getting wet or damaged. I thought that that was neat.Only complaint, is that it is slow when my daughter is moving-which is all of the time, the pic can sometimes blur. But, that is to be expected for the price range of the camera. You really have to spend quite a lot to get cameras that can take quick action shots.PS Quite chunky and durable which makes it great for a kid. I don't think that if it fell it would damage it as easily as the slim ones that are en vogue now. Also, the fun color appeals to little girls.", "Date": "September 13, 2009"}, {"Title": "Great camera, great price!", "Author": "Leonardo", "ReviewID": "R3S3CRF8K4WI9S", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Highly recommended is a good product at a price.
