The Leica comes out the winner with superb picture quality.  The sharpness is incredible and the colors are pure and clean even in mixed lighting.  There are a few areas where the Leica cant compete.  One, obviously is price.  Two, the camera doesn't have high ISO capability.  ISO 640 is about where it starts to get noisy in the shadows.  Last, while it does have auto focus, it's no match for a 35mm Canon or Nikon.  It doesn't have the array of focus sensors.  It does have a build quality that is unrivaled and the whole camera and lenses are remarkably well sealed from dust and moisture.  It feels great in your hands.  It really is a medium format digital masquerading as a 35 mm.", "Date": "June 21, 2010"}, {"Title": "I Love this!", "Author": "gatorlandkali \"gatorlandkali\"", "ReviewID": "R2XG986WQ5D3JC", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "A friend of mine lend me this camera and used it for few times and I can say it is what it is. The price says what it is, it's expensive but the quality is absolutely remarkable. The weight is evenly distributed, the lens captures what almost as you see with your own eyes [or better]. The resolution is exceptionally out of this world. I used to have a Leica Film Camera and I felt in love with photography the first time I had it as a gift from my mom when I was 13 years old. It is incredibly well built, the controls are easy, the menus are well arranged and well thought. If you have the cash, I would not hesitate to buy this piece. It will not disappoint you. Believe me.", "Date": "May 10, 2012"}, {"Title": "Price is out of control", "Author": "Aleksandre Glonti", "ReviewID": "R3QSJIVQ43QQPR", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "I played with this super camera for a while. It is absolutely outstanding. Image and build qualities are on top. Battery life is also great. About 800 images (or more).The only concern is the price of this tool. Yes, it's amazing, but still, everything has it's price, and if you ask me, it is well overpriced.If I had to decide, I would rather buy Sony a99 which has all features of modern cameras, while price tag is almost 8 times lower.", "Date": "March 6, 2013"}, {"Title": "This is one lame listing!", "Author": "Charlie Harbin", "ReviewID": "R34NA4FQ8AV0LV", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Is it just me or has Amazon forgotten to mention anything about a lens other than above average glass. From the listing, you really can't tell if a lens is included or not! Leica does make way above average equipment and this S2 is truly over the top. Unfortunately, I would have to disagree with another of the Amazon listed features: Affordable! Yeah, if your budget has room for another car payment.", "Date": "June 6, 2010"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": "$22,995.00", "Features": "Easy to handle\nAffordable Price\nGreater Lens Quality\nMuch Better in its class\nThree Inch LCD", "Name": "Leica S2 37.5MP Interchangeable Lens Camera with 3 inch LCD", "ImgURL": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41900px679L._SX300_.jpg", "ProductID": "B002KHZXXU"}}
