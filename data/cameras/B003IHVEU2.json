{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Really Lovin' This Camera So Far!", "Author": "Prophetess O. W. Petcoff \"Prophetess1\"", "ReviewID": "R38T13PKB5KTPN", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Let me begin my saying that I have not purchased a new camera in six years, so I was waaaayyyy behind in technology (I had never purchased an SD card until now, etc.). I had read so much about the user manual to this camera being hard to read, the camera functions being hard to access and use, etc., but, I must say, I found this camera easy to use and the functions were well-explained and documented in the user manual (for Pete's sake, they show the pics and give step-by-step instructions in the manual :-)).I ordered this camera from Amazon last Friday; it arrived today. We are using it to take on a cruise with us and I wanted something with a decent zoom to be able to take pictures at somewhat of a distance. I also needed to practice using it, so I took it out of the box right away. I looked at the user manual and went to work :-D. I also used the user manual on the enclosed CD. No problem!Like another poster said, I, too, researched this camera a lot before buying it and I, too, found it comparable to a couple of the Fuji Finepix that I was looking at. I am in no way an expert on cameras (I don't know much about them at all), but, I did go try this one out at Sears prior to purchasing this one from Amazon (Amazon was cheaper). While there, I noticed that they also had the Fuji I was thinking about getting, too, and I tried it. I really do like the way the GE X5 feels in my hands better than the Fuji! And, with my not needing the camera for professional purposes, I just wanted to be able to take decent pics. And, the GE camera seems to be able to do that!I am soooo excited about this camera. The pics are so clear and sharp! I am having to learn how to focus it, etc., but, so far I have gotten some good clear shots.I wanted to address some common comments that I have seen about this camera, both on Amazon and other other sites that sell this camera:1. Using Manual to Get Clearer Pics of People Up Close - Previous reviewers were saying that their pics of people up close were blurry. Other reviewers suggested to take the pics in Manual as opposed to Automatic. I don't necessarily agree with this. In fact, with my not knowing what I was doing :-), I took blurry pics in both Manual and Auto, but I took more blurry pics in Manual. What did, in fact, help me to not blur the pictures was to follow the instructions in clicking the button to take the pics. If you read the manual, it tells you to push the button half-way down to focus the pic. Once you do, you will hear a tone (unless you disable the sound feature, I guess). Once you hear the tone, press the button the rest of the way down until you hear a shutter click sound, which lets you know that the pic has been taken. Pressing it all the way down too soon caused my pics to be blurry.2. Picture Quality is Poor - People have said that the pic quality is poor. I do not agree with that. But, what I did see (and, again, I have lived in the dark ages regarding technology for so long until it might be this way with many digital cameras that I don't know about), though, is that the pic as it appears on the LCD screen is VERY GRAINY. This is true when the pic is being taken. However, if you go back and review the pics, you will see that they are not grainy (if taken correctly).3. This Camera is Not for Beginners/It is an Advanced Beginner Camera - As I stated earlier, I don't agree with that. Now, let me say that there are features that I do not know how to use on this camera and may never know how to use because I may never have a need to use them. But, you don't have to use the \"advanced\" features in order to be able to use this camera. I'm a living witness :-D.I am glad that I purchased this camera on Amazon, even though it went up $10 in my cart on literally the day I had it in the basket :-). Overall (so far), I am quite pleased with this camera.Oh, one more thing: At the time of my writing this, if you look at the What's in the Box? section, you will see that it lists 4 AA alkaline batteries are included with this camera. But, if you look at the Product Description portion, you will see that it lists 4 rechargeable AA batteries. I received the alkalines. The alkalines are doing well so far, but I will buy some rechargeables to take on the cruise with me. I have reported this discrepancy on the page to Amazon customer service and they may be fixing it soon.UPDATE ON DECEMBER 17, 2010:I wrote a very positive review of this camera, but I am now seeing many negative reviews. When I bought my camera, it was sold and shipped directly from Amazon. Now I see that it is coming directly from Capital. I don't know if there would be a difference in the camera or not; shouldn't be. My camera did not ship from Capital and I have had no problems with it. I am adding this to my review because I don't want people to think that I am endorsing a camera that may not be of good quality.", "Date": "July 28, 2010"}, {"Title": "Excellent camera for the money", "Author": "whirlpool78", "ReviewID": "R2058H8BS00HLR", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I wanted to learn more about photography without breaking the bank since this is an experiment for me I would have hated to invest a ton of money in a camera just to find that the hobby was not for me.  I looked at \"inexpensive\" DSLRs with kit lenses and well as various bridge cameras and even some P&S; Canons what I could use the CHDK with to extend the functionality.  Ultimately I decided that I wanted a bridge camera because I wanted more control and zoom over what most P&Ss; offer but I didn't want to invest a ton of money in lens with a DSLR.  I was intialy interested in the Fuji Finepix S2550 but after discovering that it didn't have a real aperture and since part of this was to learn more about digital photography I decided against that line.  I ultimately decided on the GE X5 for several reasons.1) It has a real aperture priority mode2) It had the ability to do continuous AF3) It could shoot video with optical zoom and little/no motor noise4) It could do last 3 burst at full 14MP5) It has a single press multiple shot smile detect mode which I love to use for family self portraits which with 3 kids the one shot on a set timer just isn't enough for me.6) The default mode of of the shutter is release priority which when coupled with constant AF means no missed moments while the camera focuses.7) An AF assist lamp for night photos8) The story of how General-Imaging came to be with retired execs from Olympus and Minolta getting together to make a new inexpensive camera company got me interested.These things being said there are a couple things about the camera I wish were different.1) A manual focus mode2) EV Bracketing3) HD Video4) MPEG4 video encodingOne gripe I often hear with this camera which is actually a feature I like is that the camera does not focus completely when the button is full pressed without an intermediate half press.  In DSLRs this is called release priority.  The default behavior of this camera is to auto focus on a half press and take a picture on a full press unless you turn the continuous auto focus feature on in which case the camera is always focusing.  Most P&S; cameras are focus priority which means if the button is pressed the camera focuses then takes a picture a half press just speeds that process up a little by letting you prefocus.  People used to this behavior may hate this camera as single full button presses may result in blurry pictures.  I love this feature though because I can't even begin to count how many times I have missed a moment with other P&S; cameras when I press the button just to have whatever it was I was trying to capture change while the camera focuses.  If I am shooting portraits of the kids I always half press to lock focus and then full press when the moment is right, and if I want subsequent pics I just keep pressing because the camera is already in focus from the last picture and I know it won't refocus before the next shot.  In action situations I turn on continuous AF and snap away to my hearts content, basically I am trading battery life for the ability to get instantaneous photos.Ultimately I think the price this camera is insanely good.  There are a couple of shortcomings that effect pretty much all bridge cameras and I have seen them mentioned here as flaws in this camera.  First indoor/night photos are not as good as some other cameras.  This is pretty much the case for all bridge cameras because even though the camera form factor is DSLR like the sensor inside is still small P&S; type sensor which means less light is falling on the sensor vs a DSLR which have bigger sensors and bigger glass lens that let more light in.  If you want superior dark photo taking ability you will need a DSLR no questions about it.  One saving grace for this camera though is dark frame subtraction.  What this means is if you take night pictures using a long shutter speed the camera will actually take 2 pictures, one with the shutter open and one closed.  It will then automatically correct the shutter open picture by removing sensor noise by using the picture taken with the shutter closed as a reference.  This means more noise free night long exposure shots than you get with a similar camera.Another issue is lens sharpness.  This camera is good in this regard, but not on par with say a Panasonic bridge camera.  The thing is all bridge cameras have insane lens configurations going from wide angle to super telephoto.  To pull off this change with a DSLR you would need several interchangeable lenses but all of these pieces of glass in the optical path mean that the light is being bent a lot and it will never be as sharp as a camera with a more limited range.Finally depth of field.  These sorts of cameras generally have a very wide depth of field which means it becomes more and more difficult to pull off the portrait shots with the fuzzy out of focus background we are so used to seeing from professional cameras.  I have read many many explanations why this is and often they discussions get heated as to the cause, is it the focal length of the lens, the limited aperture, the size of the sensor etc etc.  What ever the reason all P&S; type cameras have a hard time making the depth of field shallow in anything other than Macro mode so don't expect a lot with this type camera.", "Date": "November 8, 2010"}, {"Title": "IMO, a rebadged Fuji", "Author": "RS", "ReviewID": "R1UR2A82XO3G6T", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I did quite a bit of research before making this purchase ($130 at Walmart). It's a 'bridge' camera with features like a point-and-shoot, but the body style of a SLR. There aren't many reviews around or sample pics, probably due to the relative inexpensiveness of this camera, and the lack of a puffy, brand name. But if you just look closely at the physical framework of the shell, then compare the menu system to Fuji's of this caliber (download their manuals), you won't doubt my claim; when you take some pics, you'll know. 'Rebadging', or remarking, is not a new selling strategy. It has been used by the auto industry, electronics industry, and computer software industry, to name a few.Just check out my pics above, the macros of the Lily and cone flower (2 pics ea. with a 1:1 of each to compensate for Amazon's limited picture quality) and the lamp post shots (3, normal, 15x and full zoom). I could get so close with macro that I could practically touch the lens to the objects (with good light), and using full zoom you can see the screw threads of the bolts of the lamp post. This has been on QVC a few times for $169 (retail, $270), and they always claim to sell over 500 in less than an hour. The color is incredible. I compared it with a Panasonic DMC-TZ3 at comparable zoom and dpi (8MP), and the color and clarity were significantly improved. The TZ3 is $160 'Used' on Amazon.I don't know how some of these reviewers can mark this camera down unless they work for a competitor, or they just don't know how to use one (really, no manual zoom? lol). The battery life is good also. I use cheap rechargeables. The image stabilization was demonstrated by the company at a recent electronics show where they mounted it on a heavily vibrating platform yet it still took a clean, focused shot. It works great.Even if it Isn't a Fuji, it's a solid, reliable, fun camera with more capability than most people really need.*** Still using this baby with no problems. I did accidentally allow spilled juice to get into it and clog it up so badly that it wouldn't open the lens and the buttons stuck. To the rescue came my trusty 'contact cleaner'. Never heard of this amazing stuff? Well, contact cleaner is normally used to clean electrical contacts, such as the contacts in a wall socket, the contacts of rotary switches and any other electronic contacts in plug or switch form that will collect contaminants, carbon deposits and corrosion over time, effecting the functionality of the device. One squirt of this contact cleaner solves many electrical problems. It is usually electrically non-conductive and dries fast with no residue -- it's as though you never used it. Some brands do harm plastic, so you have to be cautious and 'read the label'.But wait, it's also perfect for cleaning anything else that you wouldn't want to use water on that's in a hard-to-reach location (it has a fine spray tube for such purposes), such as the inside of my GE X5. Well, it took nearly a can of spray (at $8 per can) and I could only just guess where to spray into the camera (through the battery compartment, etc.) to wash out the juice, but it worked and it was cheaper than buying a new camera or letting a repair service take weeks to clean it out the hard way. Just thought you could use this tip.", "Date": "July 28, 2010"}, {"Title": "Not the best GE camera but still worth the $149..", "Author": "Crystal D.", "ReviewID": "R16X1AKOXSLBJ", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I own the GE E1030 10MP Digital Camera with 3x Optical Zoom (Silver) and decided I'd like to update mine so I picked the X5. The X5 has all kinds of new features that the old one didn't but the image quality didn't really get any better than the old one. Still the batteries last long(still haven't timed them), the image stabilization is good but I try to avoid using it because it adds more noise to the pictures. The video & audio quality is mediocre at best and I don't know if it's just me or what because when I turn the camera on and move it around, it makes a high pitched sound that the microphone picks up during recording. Still all those problems can be easily fixed during editing, so if you don't mind a little work for a great image then I recommend this camera.", "Date": "June 1, 2010"}, {"Title": "Fantastic Camera for the Price", "Author": "corgi11", "ReviewID": "R27P5PERGB5YVG", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I have been using this camera for about 2 weeks now and I have read the good and bad reviews. I find this camera terrific and a great buy for the price. For all the people who gave this camera a bad review leave me suggest the following that I did.1. Go to the GE imaging home page for the X5 camera and download and install the latest firmware.2. Really read the instruction manual3. Make sure you press the shutter button down halfway and hold it until the camera focuses before you snap the picture.Updating the firmware made a big difference, and by following the above steps I get consistently great pictures.You can't beat all the features of this camera for the price!!!", "Date": "November 18, 2010"}, {"Title": "Great Camera for the Money", "Author": "Boots", "ReviewID": "R14FHIGR858KSW", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "After researching all the bridge cameras out there I had pretty much decided that to get the quality I wanted I would need to pay at least $350.  But then last week while on vacation my old Canon G2 suddenly quit on me and I had to pick up a replacement in a hurry.  Found the X5 at Kmart and I feel I got really lucky with this.  It is an amazing camera for the money.  Does everything the more expensive cameras does, has great picture quality and is easy to use.  There are a few shortcomings but nothing that is a deal breaker.  Macro mode is not great and video quality is just passable but otherwise it is fantastic.  I'm really impressed with the picture quality for such an inexpensive camera.  I've used many digital cameras and SLR's over the years and I am perfectly happy with this one.  No manual focus but the auto focus does a good job.  Continuous mode is kind of slow, only 2 frames per second and it needs to be set each time you shoot.  It has manual mode which is missing from most cameras in this price range.  Great deal overall and highly recommended.", "Date": "July 30, 2010"}, {"Title": "Decent for the price", "Author": "Kent Leinbach", "ReviewID": "R1XK5NZ1VZCMRU", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "Bought this to replace my beloved Fuji S1500 which I dropped.... I could have bought the Fuji S1800 for about $50 more than the GE, but I'm saving for a DSLR and the GE has the same body as my Fuji so I assume it comes from the same manufacturer.  For the price it is an excellent camera.  The long shutter (up to 30 seconds) is really nice, but it essentially never focuses at night, when that would be most useful.  It has difficulty focusing under various conditions - livable but a bummer generally.  I would think without a confirmed focus it would default to infinity, but it does not.  Generally image quality seems quite nice, long zoom is good.  Image stabilization works well with even my shaky hands on a long zoom.  The light gathering is great!  You get excellent light gathering and even blue skys at night - but it's all out of focus almost all the time (at night).  Day time performance is fine, but with occasional focusing problems.  If it would simply focus at night I would rate this a super value for the very low coin, but I must admit I'm disappointed.The video quality seems pretty good, audio quality is about what you'd expect from any camera but I'd say good overall.  The zoom is quiet - on my Fuji you would not zoom under video as it captured the sound and it was super loud, and the GE does well there, though you will still hear it.The aperture setting is disappointing - my Fuji really showed good depth of field on wide F stop (blurry background but subject in focus), but the GE seems to still get good focus on the entire image.  If you like the aperture effect of the central image in focus but the rest blurred you might look elsewhere, if that isn't important it is fine.Many of the various image modes work fine, for example black and white does a nice job of processing and the panorama mode works pretty well with some neat results.Controls are overall intuitive with a few exceptions.  Shot to shot times are fine but maybe a bit slow, but this camera is very low cost so I'll rate that acceptable.If you want to play around with manual controls this is a fine starter camera, but it has limits.  For the price a bargain - but don't expect a DSLR.", "Date": "January 23, 2011"}, {"Title": "Question other reviews", "Author": "Michael A. Hudson", "ReviewID": "R1JBRO5XLLNAJT", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "First, I want to point out that this is just a preliminary review. I researched cameras in this class for quite a while before ordering. When you look at the price and then look at the features offered, something just does not seem right. I read several bad reviews about this camera ( poor picture quality - stabilization not working - hard to use and understand with poor instructions - fuzzy LCD screen - etc.) You would almost expect this to be true at this price, but I have learned over the years, that for the most part, if a product does not carry the name of a major player ( Nikon - Canon - Kodak etc) they are immediately considered inferior.  One of the main reasons I gave this camera a shot is that not long ago I bought another GE camera ( 1486tw ) when I was looking for a pocket camera. I was very satisfied with that camera and the quality and value has continued with the X5. From the time I opened the box, I was impressed. The fit and finish was on a par with any of the best brands. If you have ever had a digital camera, you will not even need the instructions - It is that intuitive to use. So far, I have seen none of the problems complained about in those reviews I spoke of. In my opinion, you will not find a camera with this quality and features at even 1 1/2 times the price. I would recommend this X5 to anyone wanting a camera with the feel of an SLR and the ability to do everything that the SLR's are capable of.

It fits the hand well, could be operated single handedly, the image stabilization makes the 400 mm equivalent usable, the image quality is fantasic.  It has about five times the pixel information we had in the finest 35 mm camera/film combinations.  It sells for a small fraction what we paid for the same capabilities, to say nothing over the costs of film and processing.  And, you get to see it all now!

So, while I am not a newbie, I spent a lot of time with folks who are, and my upcoming book, \"How To Use The Digital Camera You Just Bought!\" is aimed at that group.I also love bargain cameras that perform way beyond their expectations. This camera is one of them. As long as you are not trying to do indoor action sports shots of your kid, you will find this camera can handle most situations.BTW, other reviewers claim there is no manual exposure setting. They apparently missed the >>>>RED M<<<<<< on the dial that is for full manual operation. How they could have missed this is beyond me!Other cool things include the ability to easily compose a 3-shot panoramic image, with the camera internally stitching three images. The camera uses the same style of capture as the latest pricey Sony \"Camera of the Year\" SLR!  You take one shot, then move the camera to align the marks on the screen and the camera takes the next shot! Do this a third time and you are done!The camera is no more or less baffling in terms of controls than any other camera. So, if it seems to difficult, you need to take a class, read a book, or sit patiently while someone who knows cameras explains it to you.  There are no \"Nerf\" digital cameras at this time. Digital cameras are not rocket-science, but they take some effort to sort out. One of my radio listeners got his camera figured out, and he's 98 years old. So don't start thinking you can't learn it because you are too old!This camera may or may not hold up for as many years as more expensive cameras, but at the price, it offers a wealth of features that many have spent two or three times the price to obtain.  It has the potential of becoming a \"cult\" camera, as in the LOMO. It even has the same finish!The only downside is that it takes 4 AA batteries where similar cameras take 2, and the auto white balance is not quite up to snuff.

The auto mode works, but I think my pics turned out better when I set the camera for my scene. It was really easy to upload the pics to my computer too. They looked really good on the computer, but I wanted to wait until I had some printed out before I left my review, just to make sure that they printed looking as good as they did on the computer. Well, they look even better.I got several smaller shooting sessions off of the batteries it came w/. I turned it off when I had longer pauses between shots.

I never used anything but \"automatic\" before so buying this camera meant I would have to do some research on how to work with manual settings and other things. A simple find on google taught me all I needed about the different settings and how to use them correctly. Now my pictures are amazing and I am absolutely in love with this camera. Although I am still learning I find that this camera is very simple to use (and I certainly don't know much about cameras). It does get a little noisy if you move it too much but I think that it's the camera attempting to focus as you are moving since it doesn't make the noise if I am perfectly still. There are also several features that are great to use when you don't have time to manually adjust the settings yourself. Everyone loves my photos and always ask what camera I have. Once I tell them the brand and price they all are shocked since the photo quality is amazing!I am so happy I made this purchase and definitely recommend people invest in this great camera!", "Date": "November 25, 2010"}, {"Title": "GE X5 DigiCam", "Author": "NGA Mountain Man", "ReviewID": "R33IWY6GA00DS", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I found the camera easy to set up and begin using within minutes.

This is the second digital camera I've owned, and the last one was an ancient hand me down. I'm a bit behind the times...This camera is feature dense. The zoom is well advertised, and it functions beautifully, but there's a trap. I've discovered that often, about half the time I adjust the zoom, I should have picked up and moved. So, while the zoom is a great resource to have, it can be overused. There are also ways to adjust the aperture, exposure, color saturation, and a dozen things I haven't figured out yet. While all of this is wonderful, I guess this falls in the ease of use category as I suppose a camera with fewer features would tempt one to adjust fewer settings, and thus be easier.Battery life is a legitimate concern, but fortunately this camera runs on ubiquitous AA batteries. A set of rechargeable batteries and a backup set of alkaline gets me through even a pretty long day, and replacements are absolutely everywhere, so it's never been a real hindrance.My only problem with this camera; it was a challenge to find a case. After a little creative shopping, the M-Rock Vista is a great fit and a really solid bag.

I have used an old Nikon film camera with a removable lens for a photography class in college. (I think I still have the camera around somewhere.) But I have not done any serious photography since then. I generally use my cell phone camera (Motorola Droid) and a Nikon Coolpix point and shoot digital camera. I think I paid about the same for the Coolpix (several years ago) as I did for this GE camera, but the difference in quality is impressive.Without the flash, the GE and my old Nikon film camera take about the same quality pictures. Meaning, in bright sunlight or low light with a steady hand or tripod they both take pretty good pictures. The GE is far superior to the Coolpix camera though. The Coolpix camera takes about the same quality pictures with flash that the GE camera takes without. (Assuming there is enough light to read by.)In sunlight the GE camera works very well, assuming you have a steady hand. (Just like any camera.) Even with the zoom fully extended I was able to take pictures of the steeple of the local church that were completely in focus and looking very vibrant.There was a review that said they were disappointed in how \"cheap\" the camera felt. I can't disagree more. It feels like a solid piece of electronics. My old Nikon film camera felt more solid, but the GE is the most solid digital camera I have ever used. I suppose that there must be really nice SLR digital cameras out there, but I've never used them.This camera is a great buy for it's price ($130 at the time of this review) and if you want a camera that is better than a point and shoot or cell phone camera, but don't want to spend thousands of dollars to buy a nice SLR that you'll probably only use occasionally, then this is the camera for you.If you are a serious photography buff and will use the camera for more than just vacations and special occasions, then you might look into getting a real SLR camera instead.Final note: There are only two problems I have with the camera. #1 is that there is a single stuck pixel on the display. This happens sometimes and I'm not overly concerned by a single stuck pixel, but it was slightly disappointing out of the box. #2 is more serious though. It's a poor design choice on the part of GE. The SD card slot is inside the compartment for the batteries. You need to open the battery compartment (careful not to spill the batteries) in order to get the SD card out. With 8 and 16 gig SD cards available I don't see myself changing the card often, but I do like to use the SD card like a thumb drive in my machine instead of plugging in the cord. So it is something of a hassle to get the SD card in and out when I want to get pictures off of it. But it's unlikely that I would need to do it during an event due to the large capacity of available SD cards so it's not a deal breaker. The camera is still a excellent value for the price.Edit: Two weeks after I bought the camera the controls failed to respond. I could turn the camera on, but none of the buttons would work. It was also impossible to turn off without extracting the batteries. Amazon was quick and painless in the exchange process and I got the replacement camera (cross shipped) a week before I went on vacation. My mother actually put her $2,000 SLR camera away and just used mine instead because the GE camera was much more compact and shot nearly as good pictures, and at $130 we could afford to break it or have it snatched. (I was much more worried about losing the pictures on the SD card if it were snatched than the camera itself, I swapped out the 8 gig cards before they were even 25% filled just to ward against that possibility.) On the down side the new camera had a stuck pixel on the LCD as well, in the same place, or nearly the same place, so I fear that might be a defect that is common in this camera. The pictures taken in daylight looked great, the pictures taken in shade were also good if you used the flash for fill light, or have an extremely steady hand. The night pictures without flash were terrible unless I used a tripod, but with the flash on, they were just fine. The camera survived being used by me, my mother, and about a dozen different members of our host family in the Philippines, so it's fairly rugged if you don't drop it with the lens extended. It was dropped once in the grass and once onto a wooden table with the lens cap on and suffered no damage.The video quality is actually pretty good for a $130 camera. I was expecting it to be pretty terrible, but it exceeds the quality of most youtube videos, and really if you're taking video with a $130 camera, you aren't exactly looking for better than that are you?It's not a real replacement for an SLR camera for a serious photographer (or a camcorder for that matter), but for a vacation or outdoor/indoor event for a semi-experienced photographer that knows when to use flash and when not to, and how to hold a camera steady while it is auto-focusing and until the shutter closes then this is the camera for the budget conscious.", "Date": "February 19, 2011"}, {"Title": "Happy so far", "Author": "Amy L.

I figured I would treat myself to a new camera for Christmas and was looking at the next step up from the Canon point and shoots. I was on Amazon doing comparisons when I found this little surprise.

Allison \"Eager Reader\"", "ReviewID": "R2AJY2MPP6ULIB", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "After using the camera for six weeks I am ready to write a little review.  This is very comfortable to hold and is loaded with features.  The quality is very good.  As others have noted, this appears to be a relabeled Fuji camera.I compared the GE (15x) to a Nikon Coolpix S6000 (7x).  The skinny Coolpix fits in a pocket easier but is much harder to hold. The programmed features are comprehensive and very similar - panorama picture stitching, multipoint autofocus, face recognition, etc.  The GE adds some additional manually selected programs, plus aperture priority, shutter priority and manual exposure.  The GE offers more choices in metering the light exposure.The GE has a pop-up flash which makes turning the flash on/off quick.  The elevated flash reduces red-eye.  The flash can be set to give a pre-flash which further reduces red-eye.  The night flash is good, balancing environmental light with fill-flash on the subject.  The flash range is very good, at least 25 feet.  The Nikon flash tends to get covered by a finger when holding the camera.  Nikon's flash range is not as far as GE's.The GE has a very sharp lens with very good multi-coating on the lens elements to reduce lens flare.  In the 14mp setting you can  actually see all those pixels.  GE and Nikon are equals here. But as expected for a 15x zoom, there is a slight barrel distortion at the shortest wide-angle focal length (FL).  The distortion is nearly invisible when extended to the same FL as the Nikon's widest angle. The distortion remains invisible until extended to the longest FL where a very slight pincushion effect occurs.  This is quite acceptable for all general photography.Some sensor flare (a purple colored ray) occurs when the camera is pointed directly at a bright light.  However, it is less than the flare in the Nikon.  Both are acceptable in this regard.Both cameras have image stabilization to reduce blurring if the camera shakes.  The GE is good, but the Nikon is slightly better.Movie mode is very sharp, but limited to a maximum 640x480 resolution.  You will usually want to turn on continuous autofocus in movie mode.  I experienced no dropped frames or image blocking.  The Nikon has an HD option.  The sound quality was only fair, but at least the mike was directional, which is reduces stray noises.  The Nikon sound was slightly better but seemed less directional.  Sound would improve with an externally mounted mike, but many movie cameras don't offer that either.The GE LCD display panel is sharp but could use more anti-reflective coatings. The Nikon has superior coatings on its display panel. Both have the same number of pixels. The GE has a good automatic LCD brightness adjustment which is lacking on the Nikon.GE has a very fine viewfinder with complete display functions and same resolution as the 3\" panel.  The Nikon has no viewfinder.  The viewfinder saves some power and has no problems from ambient light. Most importantly, you can hold the camera against your face for a steady image and still see what you are filming.  The viewfinder is very important to me.  I wear glasses and use the viewfinder without any problem.The time required to take a picture is slightly longer with the GE than the Nikon.  At first, I thought the GE was slow, but once I learned its features, the time shortened noticeably.GE and Nikon both use two position shutter buttons.  The first position initiates the autofocus and exposure.  Pushing down all the way trips the shutter.  Shutter speeds are similar, about 4 seconds - 1/2000.  The GE offers very long exposures in the manual modes and also offers a selection of time-lapse exposures.Battery life is fair.  Alkaline batteries lasted about 250 pictures, mostly using the focus assist light, continuous autofocus, flash, and the display panel. Turning off one or more of those features could extend the battery life.  Rechargeable batteries might not work as well as expected.  To be fair, my rechargeable NiMH batteries are four years old and probably over-the-hill.  I noticed that the camera is conservative about turning on.  If any battery is under 1.30 volts, the camera doesn't want to start.  However, if you slide the ON switch a couple times, the camera may start and continue to work for quite some time.My model shipped with firmware version 2.03. Their website offers 1.05 so I have not tried different firmware.  The box contained an abbreviated 29 page manual. The CD-Rom had an 89 page manual in B&W.; The GE website has the longer manual in color.  You really need the long manual if you want to learn all about the camera. The CD includes a basic photo program, but I prefer the open-source IRFANview.  The camera comes with mini-USB and RCA video cables.In summary, this is a fine camera for anyone who wants the features it offers and a best-buy in its category.", "Date": "February 3, 2011"}, {"Title": "A Camera with staying power! -DF", "Author": "Debbie Folkert", "ReviewID": "RVYVYLEQAXXXF", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Bought this camera in 2010. ..and haven't regretted it once. I LOVE the video option on it, and use it a lot. Snow storms, grandchild, pets, wildlife, vistas...and making records for insurance  and other legal purposes-this camera is very versatile. Zoom is excellent at capturing detail. Color is amazing. Pop-up flash works great and red eye is filtered out on most shots, but there is also an option to remove it too. (Most computers will do this also.) This camera also comes with a built-in microphone. It's not the best (you must really speak up to be heard-and make sure you're not covering it up on the body of the camera) -I really LOVE this feature too when video taping with it because you can identify what/where you are when on extended vacations and use the camera extensively. There view screen to review shots immediately and trash pics that aren't what you want. If you want a fantastic camera buy this one-you won't be sorry.

Mine was an open box/display unit that cost me a mere $119.Less than half a day later, I was already using it to shoot photos at the StarFest science fiction/fantasy convention at the Denver Tech Center. It performed admirably!As it was my first superzoom, I expected the learning curve to be steep. It wasn't. The X5 really delivered.On the down side, the automatic setting can become confused in settings where you are in deep darkness and the subject is in bright light, such as a stage performance, or a room that's \"bright\" to the human eye, but not to the camera. Learning to use the manual settings deals with this nicely, and after a bit of practice with choosing shutter speed and ISO, I was taking photos like... well, perhaps not a pro, but definitely an enthusiastic amateur.And it has one advantage that makes up for small sins - it's one of the few inexpensive superzooms that still has a VIEWFINDER! Hurrah! I wear glasses and have shaky hands. Being able to stabilize things by holding the camera up to my eyes and looking through a viewfinder makes framing a shot MUCH easier.The use of AA batteries is another plus - I shoot a LOT of photos during the costume contest at StarFest, and to be honest, a single Lithium battery wasn't going to make it through the night. Not even two batteries would. But a sixteen-pack of cheap AA batteries saw me through almost 1200 photos that night. If you're going to take a lot of photos in a short period of time, this is very helpful. And it can still use standard rechargeable AA batteries, if you're concerned about recycling.Customer support was also grand - I needed a new lens cap, and emailed GE asking for information as to where I could buy one. They sent me one for free.Finally, while at the StarFest, I saw people with incredibly costly cameras. They were easy to spot - they were the ones who flinched every time you got within arms length of them. At $119, the X5 (and presumably it's newer cousin, the X500) can be replaced without your wallet screaming in agony.If you want a superzoom and don't have bottomless pockets, the X5 just works. It has its limits and its flaws, but for the price, it can't be beaten.", "Date": "November 1, 2012"}, {"Title": "great to do business with", "Author": "Mike Jones", "ReviewID": "R2ESE3DLHJLKXU", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This merchant was Great to do business with.

My ex husband and I had a great 35 mil camera, professional, he had purchased while in High school for a photography class he had, I took it over once we got married and began learning how to use one so sophisticated.Since the digital age has come to a new world of point and shoots, digicams, and dslrs, I have been searching and searching for just the right camera to do what I love to do... Take pictures.I have used so many different inexpensive cameras, all the way up to more expensive dslrs that I still cannot afford yet. I have done my own fair share of shopping, trying out, and figuring out what I wanted in a camera. When I found the GE X5. It was inexpensive compared to the others that I was looking at and comparing to, but when I began to look, touch, hold, and shoot pictures and compare everything, I decided this was the one for me.Was I right!!! I have photographed everything from newborn babies, toddler milestone shoots, candid photo sessions with kids at the park, sports photos of soccer, volleyball, and football teams, cheerleaders, and so much more. Senior Pictures, Engagement Photos, Landscapes, sunsets, storms, clouds, and even weddings. I have never had a camera that could hold its own in photo quality to a professional DSLR camera, but this one takes the cake. In my own experience of zooming in quality photos, I have even zoomed in with this little camera and got the most amazing details of the moon, the craters, caverns, and so much more... The detail looked like I used a telescope and snapped it... AMAZING!!!The quality of these photos allow me to blow them up to poster sizes, retouch, edit, and even do specialty edits without distorting, changing the photo or adding too much noise or pixilating to the photo. In short, I LOVE THIS CAMERA. I just bought another camera this week, as a birthday present to myself, but, in reality, I think I am sticking with the GE X series cameras. I can't imagine switching to another brand when everything I want and need is in one camera.The only true CON I have had with this camera is 2 things...1. Continuous photos can only be done on timer, the processing time between shots is a little long for good, fast photo secession, but I have found that in all these types of cameras.2. A few times when I was recording on MOV mode, the sound was drowned out with a buzzing noise. But that seems to have resolved itself. Thankfully, I use it often.", "Date": "October 20, 2012"}, {"Title": "I Love This Camera", "Author": "Kalaab M. Pickering", "ReviewID": "R22YVX6RK3UE51", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I've owned this camera for over a year now, and it has been one of the best purchases I've ever made.  This camera is a versatile, reliable workhorse.  You can really grow into its features if you're like I was when I bought it, which is to say a point-and-shoot only photographer.I didn't really get into photography prior to the digital revolution, and my first few forays into the field were mainly with good-quality point-and-shoot rigs.  However, as I developed my skills, it became clear that even a great point-and-shoot camera wasn't refined enough for what I wanted to do.  Specifically, I wanted to be able to manually set f/stops, white balance, ISO settings, and shutter speed.  Some of those features are available in point-and-shoot cameras, but usually not all of them in combination.  The GE X5 fit my needs perfectly.First, a few negatives: the camera seems bulky compared to point-and-shoot rigs.  This is a relative point, however; this thing looks like a roll of mints compared to some DSLR's I've used.  Second, there's no manual focus, but I'm not sure there are any \"bridge\" cameras like the X5 that have that as a feature.I was repeatedly impressed by the X5's repeated comparison to the DSLR category.  Granted, this is not a DSLR and can't really be considered a \"professional\" camera, but its features fit the bill even for particular enthusiasts like myself.The camera's form is reminiscent of a DSLR, which is to say big but ergonomic.  The lens on the front is a good size without being front-heavy.  The flip-up flash is as easy as it gets; open it, and the flash is on, close it and it's off.  The zoom lever is at a good position and is easy to reach.  The camera also features a digital view finder, a must for me, since I don't much care for sighting in pictures with the LCD screen.  But, the X5 does have a nice, bright LCD screen that makes the process enjoyable when I do choose to use it.The camera has many different modes, including video, panorama, and auto mode.  The auto mode consistently yields high-quality photos at most light conditions.  In video mode, the quality is lacking, making this camera less than ideal in this category.  The panorama mode seemed like it was going to be great, but even with a tripod the camera has a tendency to yield a cartoonish and malformed picture.  This wasn't a big deal to me, because I prefer to assemble panoramic shots manually through Photoshop.Speaking of manual operations, I cannot stress how liberating it is to have a camera with so many features available to set manually.  I've captured everything from hummingbirds at high speed to fireworks at night, and the manual mode ensures that you can consistently dial in everything you need to capture the perfect shot.  I have a hard time with auto modes in general, even on a camera as great as the X5, so having the ability to tinker with the camera to yield the results you want is critical to my photography technique.  There are a lot of people out there who feel that having to adjust the camera so finely interferes with the photography process in general, but one of my favorite aspects of photography is knowing that the input I give my camera consistently makes the difference between a good photo and a great one.My philosophy with cameras is the same as with guitars or computers: use what you have until you outgrow it.  If you don't outgrow your equipment, don't upgrade.  The X5 was the perfect camera for me to step up to.  The quality of my photographs has improved vastly since this purchase.  A lot of photographers say \"Cameras don't take great pictures, photographers do.\"  I'll agree with that to a certain extent, but there's a reason why pros don't shoot weddings with point-and-shoot cameras.  Their needs are beyond what can be supplied by lesser equipment.  If you're at the point where you know your point-and-shoot isn't giving you what you need, stop right now and buy this camera.", "Date": "September 14, 2012"}, {"Title": "ge camera", "Author": "kerdelle", "ReviewID": "R2NXR47C5KBRD4", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "ok i bought this camera at kmart for 69$.

This GE X-5 digital camera reminds me quite a bit like my prior Fuji digital camera and one other camera brand I spotted elsewhere, so using this digital camera is generally quite easy. I am a bit picky with how good I want my photos to turn out and I don't expect DSLR-quality photos, but overall picture quality with this camera is quite acceptable for me. Videos comes out pretty good with this camera. Features are plentiful for a low-priced \"super-zoom\" digital camera.The only drawbacks were few: poor macro zoom, short battery life, picture quality not quite as good as my older & lower powered Fuji Finepix S1000 digital camera, and finally a loose lense cap.

I didn't get into that class, but after becoming aptly familiar with the camera and its various settings. This is my first \"pro\" camera, and it's been quite a ride.The lens is excellent (4.9mm is roughly 28mm at a 35mm equivalence and 15x that is like 400mm or something). Macro mode works like a dream. The good pictures taken with this yielded crisp and clear pictures. You can zoom in with some of the larger pictures, and it will be far from perfect, but you can't expect that level of detail with only a 1/2.3\" CCD sensor.Now let me talk about the \"bad\" pictures.Low-light performance is horrible. This camera is plagued by both horrible noise performance at ISO's above 800 and blurry pictures from the \"good, but not good enough\" electronic image stabilizer reduced a handful of my images to being worthy of only a VGA resize on the web (to be fair, I keep my image stabilization at regular not \"+\" most of the time). Turning off the Auto-focus beam increases the chances of the picture being out of focus. Sometimes I turn it off as a courtesy to my subjects, or animals I happen to be taking pictures of.Even in the best of conditions, though, I expect this camera to pump out good prints at up to A4 sizes. It's not the smartest sensor, either, since it had managed to underexpose one of my perfectly well lit pictures (out of ~80 pictures taken whilst on Program AE with EV=0.0). Luckily it has a OSD histogram picture (a feature I didn't know how to use at the time)Though I have an inkling that the \"screw a tennis ball to the camera mount\", or the \"set to 2-second self-timer and focus on holding steady\" tricks will work wonders, I would invest some money on a cheap mono-pod just to have it handy in the case of lowlight pictures if you're like me and refuse to use un-diffused/un-softened flash.This camera is definitely capable of taking good pictures (it's excellent with enough lighting), though it's not as \"smart\" as your run-of-the-mill Point & Shoot, it gives you those pro features to compensate for that. So if you're willing to take the time to really get to know this camera, this is a very capable low-budget camera, and a very good one if you can work past the limitations. On the other hand, you can bomb some potentially good (well composed) pictures if you didn't check your exposure, focus, and blur (though these can be post-processed or resized to be less noticeable).Oh. and yes. there is a whirring-ish noise when you record videos. so if you want videos check out that next model: the GE X500, they might've fixed all of the problems I've had with this one, who knows?", "Date": "April 25, 2011"}, {"Title": "Good product, Great for the Price", "Author": "SSodhi", "ReviewID": "R8S9TLDPMK8I8", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "The GE X5, is comparable to a lot of more expensive cameras and is, in my opinion almost equally good.I bought this one around the same time my girlfriend bought a more expensive Canon with similar specs.

We also purchased a class-6 SD card to go with it and combined both products have more than met our expectations.I would recommend this camera to those looking for a value camera that is a little more than a point and shoot with plenty of options to play with. Looks really nice and appears to be an expensive camera,also it has both a viewer and a 2.7 inch screen,the blink detection is a nice feature to alert you to retake picture.

Indoor picture quality is just not acceptable. The flash works on and off,  every 3 or 4 pictures maybe. Sometimes it does not fire at all even after using a forced flash setting in the flash menu. When it worked it was so strong that most of the pictures came white. Outside the house  the picture quality is good with strong sunlight.  However, results vary. The zoom is great. My Sony 6 megapixel camera took better pictures under the same lighting conditions than this GE X5.Macro is decent when the lens focuses on the subject. I do not know if my unit had a defective flash, but most of the fun in life happens inside and at night. A camera with a decent low light performance is a plus for me. . It took me over 300 pictures to come to this conclusion. Most of my photos were taken under strong fluorescent lighting and they all came dark. Thanks to Aperture for Mac I was able to bring them back to life. However, it is ok to adjust 3 or 4 pictures with a photo editor not 100. The batteries last a long time. I used high capacity rechargeable batteries. Because of all of this facts I am returning it back to Amazon. I will shoot for a new model from another company. I was skeptic about a GE camera since most of my kitchen appliances are GE. I guess I learned my lesson.

Aimed and shot the same image. GE X5 Pro has 14MP while the Olympus has 12MP but it has 720p HD. Both have 15x Optical Zoom. What I didn't like about the GE X5 Pro was even with the Blur, Shake etc. the picture always came out the same way. The Zoom lens stick out in this SLR like point and shoot. Still I would have thought the image would be better but sure enough it wasn't what I had expected. The camera looks like Fuji S-1800, which I also had when that was first introduce. I had to send that back because all I had seen the LCD panel was blue snow noise. Not even  Flash the firmware could fix that issue. So I had to send that back. Got the Olympus instead! Well this was a bad mistake and I've sent this one back because of the blur issue and LCD panel was snowy in low to medium light. Outdoors it was okay no noise. But the view finder wasn't optical more digital view. Shooting with the LCD Panel outdoors I  had aimed an tested one last shut but with max lens did show up well but the picture that came out was blurry. Don't get me wrong the camera looks good and shoots so, so, but not the greatest pictures though. Transfer from GE X5 Pro to Windows 7 Ultimate 64-bit worked but out of 93 shots it had frozen. But when I had gone to looked all the images did transfer okay but the OSD shown me the wrong info from the GE X5 Pro.
