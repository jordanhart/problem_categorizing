I was intending to by a camera with changeable lenses, but after much thought I decided I wanted a camera that took great pictures but not a lot of fuss.  I have had the 35 MM's with all the lenses and it can be a great hassle lugging all the 'stuff' along.  Then I found this camera - its a great bridge camera to the SLR's.  The lens on this camera can bring things in that I can't even see with 20/20 vision, or can't distinguish an features.  This is actually the 4th or 5th Fuji camera I have bought and I have always been VERY satisfied.  My first 35 mm camera many years ago was recommended by a professional photographer who said you couldn't beat the price/quality of Fuji.  You get many of the same features you get on the well known brands but you don't pay for the name recognition.  I still have much to learn about this  camera but I have taken it on several 'test drives' this week and it has preformed great.  I have turned out some very nice pictures.  There are many features that I need to learn more about, but it has some features that the SLR's twice the price have.Awesome camera and its light weight and easy to use.UPdate:  I have had my camera for more than a month now ---  love it,love it, love it!!!!  The  50X zoom is Amazing.  The clarity of the pictures is unbelivable!  So glad I chose this camera.  I have been carrying everywhere and caputured some really great pictures.  Still learning about all the different settings but if you  dont want to experiment--  you can always just leave it on automatic, or SR auto.", "Date": "August 4, 2013"}, {"Title": "Awesome camera", "Author": "Amazon Customer", "ReviewID": "R31KL8R572V0SI", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "i received this camera today and i am already in love.....haven't hat a change to do much with it yet by the zoom is indeed amazing and the adv mood is pretty cool. for my first slr i dont regret it and yes i've used other slr's before.", "Date": "November 9, 2013"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": "$354.99", "Features": "16.2MP 1/2.3\" CMOS Sensor\nFujinon 50x Optical Zoom Lens\n35mm Equivalent Focal Length: 24-1200mm\n3.0\" 920k-Dot Tilting LCD Monitor\nContinuous Shooting: 10fps", "Name": "Fujifilm FinePix SL1000 Digital Camera Kit.
