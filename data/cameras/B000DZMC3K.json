{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Another excellent choice from Fuji", "Author": "Gadgester \"No Time, No Money\"", "ReviewID": "R1US3YOVW0ARYW", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I just got this yesterday from Amazon. I got the orange model because it just looks so stylish (in picture and, indeed, in person). This is to be my backup compact camera, when I don't have my beloved Fujifilm Finepix F30 6MP camera with me.  (Compared to the F30, the V10 is taller but thinner and shorter. They weigh about the same, I think.)Here're my initial impressions:PICTURE QUALITY: very good outdoors during the day, and average/above-average indoors. Fujifilm (aka Fuji) has produced a line of compact cameras, starting with the F10, renowned for their low-light, high-ISO performance. (ISO refers to the camera's sensitivity to light; the higher the ISO is, the less light the camera requires in order to capture an image with enough brightness and contrast.) The F30, my workhorse, is just superb in low-light conditions, pretty much rivaling (or even besting) my digital SLR, the Nikon D70. The V10 uses a slightly older sensor than the F30 -- in fact, the V10's sensor and \"Real Photo\" processor are the same as the discontinued F10. This means two things: 1) When there's enough light, the V10 turns in excellent-looking pictures; 2) When the light is dim, the V10 cannot match the image quality of the F30. In fact, it seems to be slightly worse than the F10 in capturing low-light images. But compared to most other compact digital cameras, even those from Canon and Nikon, the V10 does a quite respectable job. For example, if you use the V10 to capture a candlelight moment, the image won't steal your heart, but it'll make a nice memorable photo, provided you have steady hands or use a tripod.VIDEO QUALITY: 640x320 (VGA) or 320x240 (QVGA) with sound. Recorded in AVI format which is great for mobile playback as almost all mobile video devices can support AVI. You cannot zoom during shooting (reason: zooming produces horrendous-sounding motor noise which could be amplified by the movie mode, hence Fujifilm disabled zooming during movie shooting). Very good video quality when played back on a PC or TV (in the VGA mode).USABILITY: very fast, very responsive. The V10 also uses the same interface as other Fujifilm compacts, so if you've used a Fuji before, you'll be right at home with this one (except perhaps with the placement of the buttons). People switching from other brands will face an easy learning curve. The buttons are small but responsive. The gigantic 3.0\" LCD viewfinder is very bright and high-resolution (230,000 pixels). It's also very fast, meaning you'll see scenes in real-time as you shoot pictuers or video.GAMES: the only camera on the market to offer games!  You get four of them. Quite entertaining, and the graphics of the games looks really great on the 3-inch LCD screen. The controls, however, are a bit awkward due to shape and placement of the four-way controller. If you have nimble fingers you'll get used to the controls fairly quick. I love the games.BATTERY: don't know yet as I haven't run it through a torture test. Rated at 170 pictures according to the Japanese CIPA standard. My F30 is rated at 550 but I took over 500 shots plus loads of movies on one charge last time.STYLING: not as thin as those crazy Sony or Casio models. (BTW I love Sony and Casio cameras, too. Canon and Panasonic also make great compact digital cameras - Panasonic ones have great image stabilization. I'm not hot on Nikon or Kodak or Minolta or Pentax, and to me HP cameras are too ugly. Won't even consider any other brands.) The orange color looks delicious. Overall styling is eye-catching, esp. that huge 3\" LCD...In summary, I think I like this Fuji a lot.  It won't replace my F30 for important family photos, but it'll make a great tote-in-the-biker bag/handbag camera for everyday photo opportunities.PS: I should mention this. Fujifilm is a huge sponsor of the conservation of giant pandas and other endangered specifies. I end up buying only Fuji cameras these days both because of their excellent quality and their generosity toward conservation efforts. Thank you, Fujifilm.PPS: My unit is \"made in Japan.\" When I first turned it on yesterday there was what looked like a green dead pixel on the LCD, but it magically disappeared after an hour or two, so now the LCD looks perfect and defect-free.", "Date": "November 9, 2006"}, {"Title": "Nice", "Author": "R. Hook", "ReviewID": "R91ZSHOQYIJ6O", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I bought this camera on a recent trip to Japan. Its probably the most attractive camera currently available at any price. This is mainly because of its good looks, quality materials (it seems to be all metal) and 3 inch screen.- The image quality seems to be about average for a budget camera. Dont expect too much in this area. From my experience, it seems to take excellent daylight photos. Indoor photos with flash are good to average.- Movie quality is average but takes huge amounts of memory. Best to avoid using it.- The screen is clear and displays photos nicely.- The included games are pretty fun and make use of the big screen.- The menus are well laid out and easy to navigate.- It uses XD memory cards. For most people this is a negative because most PDA's and other cameras use SD cards. Most importantly, XD cards are a tad more expensive than SD cards. I bought a 256mb card which quickly filled up. I wish i bought 512mb.One feature that i have found useful is the voice notes. You can select a photo and attach a 30 second voice note to it. The audio quality is very good too. It takes about 400kb of memory to use this feature.If your after a reasonably priced camera that is refined and well built then get this one.PS: One plus about this camera is that its made in Japan. Most budget ones are now made in China and feel cheap by comparison (plasticky and ugly).PS2: Be prepared for people to compliment your camera wherever you go!PS3: Yes i really have the orange colour.", "Date": "November 27, 2006"}, {"Title": "I love it.  Not perfect, but still real good.", "Author": "Thanol", "ReviewID": "R2TL5N7RHFSXUI", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "For the price of $150 w/ shipping, this thing was a steal like a month ago. While it isn't perfect, you still are getting a pretty good camera for the price.  Remember, you're getting a solid point and shoot ultra compact camera, this probably isn't going to win you any artsy awards for best photo, unless they're candid shots.  Oh and don't think that the price is an indicator of the build quality, this camera is pretty sturdy, and as an added plus it's made in Japan, or at least mine was.Note: If you're looking for something with better image quality, go for a F20 or F30.  The Fujifilm F20's a tab bit more expensive, a bit bigger and uglier (well it is), but if size and price aren't a problem go for that instead of this, especially where image quality is a must.  Back when I got my V10 the F20 was like $50+ more expensive, so I just settled,  but now that they're about the same price I might have gone for F20.Pros:*It feels strong/sturdy, and looks sweet*It takes pretty good pictures, at least for 4x6\" prints.  But, obviously for a compact camera, the pictures aren't going to turn out flawless, technology really hasn't progressed that far, really the biggest changes to todays cameras have been reduction in size and price.  Oh, btw, I really don't see that much of a difference between 5 megapixels and 3 so.*Inexpensive, the price alone tilted my rating positively.*Responsive, it takes pictures pretty quickly and the controls don't lag.  You can take candid pictures of people so easily, with this thing.*Ultra-compact, and still affordable; sometimes I strap the camera (in a case mind you) to my arm and go running, it's really convenient.*Adjustable ISO up to 1600, the ISO is the camera's sensitivity to light, the higher you set it the faster the camera will take the picture and the pictures will generally turn out a bit brighter.  This is really useful for low light situations or when you're taking a picture of something moving at a decent speed, but keep in mind that the higher the ISO the more noise there is.  Regardless, the pictures still print (4x6) alright, despite the very noticeable noise; so it's a trade off.  Generally try to keep the ISO levels 400 or below, as you won't get much noticeable noise at those levels, though you might have some issues with blur, depending on the lighting.*The screen.  I love it.  It it such an upgrade over my old Sony's 1.25\".  I can't believe how I managed without it before.*The video it takes is pretty good.  BTW, it comes with sound.*It's really easy to move pictures off the camera, it's pretty much drag and drop, if that's how you use it.*the zoom (3.4x which is .4x higher than most other cameras of it's size) is nice, but would be nicer if the camera had image stabilization.Neutral:*Battery life is okay, You need to charge it every so often, more so than some other cameras, but it's decent.*It doesn't have built-in image stabilization, but I'll let it slide since practically no cameras under $200, especially cameras this size, include it.*Holding it is a little wierd, since the screen takes up the entire back, there's no place else besides the screen to rest your thumb.*It takes pretty good low light pictures, w/o flash compared to a lot of other cameras; you'll have to hold the camera really still though, which is a bit hard, or get a tripod.  The images tend to be a little grainy, but that's pretty normal.*Noise: On ISO 400+, like it's noticeable, but not glaringly noticeable, until 1600. Also as I said before there's a decent amount for night mode shots.  Otherwise, it's pretty good with noise at levels below 400.Cons:*It only takes xD cards, thankfully, Fujifilm has seen the error in its ways and Fuji's newer cameras will be SD compatible, maybe the V20 will take SD.  I really just hate how xD cards can only be used in Fuji and Olympus cameras, and they're like twice the price of SD cards.*The screen's a fingerprint magnet.*There's no hold switch, I know that like no camera has an actual hold switch, but it would be nice to have that so the lens doesn't accidentally extend if you were to have it in some enclosed area, pockets or bags.*The USB cable isn't a standard mini-USB, I'm not sure what it is, but it just means I have to carry around one more cord, when I travel.", "Date": "February 13, 2007"}, {"Title": "Great buy!", "Author": "Vissi d'arte \"Music_Lover\"", "ReviewID": "R2ZK2XXG866KQH", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I just bought this amazing camera today, played with it WHOLE day and the result was SUPERB!

McLeod", "ReviewID": "R2567L4BF8TJ3I", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I bought this camera for an upcoming vacation, and I'm very pleased with it so far.  The price was a little more than what I wanted to spend ($320), but for a 3\" LCD there's no better deal on the market right now.Pros:--Attractive camera that's slim enough to fit in a big pocket or small purse.--3\" LCD is stylish and will impress all your friends.  Seems pretty strach-resistant.--Super fast start-up time.  Its literally about a second.--Pictures are clear and beautiful!--Rechargable Li-ion battery means you won't fly through expensive AA batteries.--Menu options for flash, picture quality, ISO, self-timer are very intuitive.--In particular, there is a great flash setting takes two consecutive images for each picture; one is the pic with flash, the other is without.  You can go back later to decide which picture looks betterCons:--When you're using the LCD viewfinder the picture always looks grainy, but the pictures are perfect on playback so it don't really matter.--If you're comfortable using only the optical viewfinder, like I was, using the LCD alone can be an adjustment.--Menu options for more advanced manual features like white balance are not as clear and accessible as they could be--3.4x optical zoom is good, but not greatSummary:This is the camera I love to keep in my purse for those moments I never anticiapate needing a camera for.  You can whip it out, turn it on in a second, use the huge LCD to find the image you want to take and snap.  At the most you might spend a few extra seconds changing the settings.While this camera is perfect for me, its not for everyone.  If your priorities are an optical viewfinder, powerful zoom, or great manual controls consider something else.", "Date": "March 16, 2006"}, {"Title": "A Very Satisfied Customer", "Author": "Cinemandy", "ReviewID": "R2HEJJ34MUC6YE", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I did exhaustive--almost excessive--research before settling on the Fuji Finepix V10 and so far it has paid off. This may be the best priced, ultra-compact camera with a 3-inch screen on the market at this time! That's because the price has dropped as the camera's been out for a while now. That shouldn't deter you. I got mine at B&H.; Beginners, you don't need more than 5 megapixels unless you're printing 11x14--or larger prints. Higher and higher megapixel cameras are merely a marketing ploy that misdirects unknowing customers. A 5.1 mp (as this model is) is more than enough for 8x10's--and even the shots I took with this camera where I reduced the megapixels to 3 produced lovely 4x6 prints. (I reduced the pixel size to get more images on that 16mb memory card it came with before installing my larger 256mb XD card.) I've had the camera for about a month and am extremely pleased. Some of my research involved comparing images on photography websites using test still-lifes and set-ups pitting this model against those of the top-rated and similar Canon models and I found negligible differences. This one had, at that time, a better price and I preferred it to Canon because of its design and larger screen. The only main Canon advantage I found was their closer Macro setting. I disagree with the reviewer who said it produced grainy shots. If you hold the camera steady and know how to focus with a digital camera it produces beautiful sharp prints, especially if you have enough light. You'll see the sharpness when you look at your prints. The camera's LCD screen can look a little pixelated and at times a little dim in the brightest outdoor sunlight. Then all you need to do is hold it at another angle to see the image you snapped. You will probably not find a better deal for such a large screen with a known brand at this price. Solid, uniquely retro, yet futuristic at the same time, this is an easy-to-use, chic, stylish little camera as well as a quality one with it's metal frame. This camera's price has really dropped down in the past month so it's a great deal and a good time to buy.", "Date": "January 7, 2007"}, {"Title": "If only I could give more than 5 stars...", "Author": "Phil O", "ReviewID": "RC2FD9TWLY6FV", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I own several digital cameras including a Nikon digital SLR, but I wanted something that I could carry with me to have available for the photos I constantly miss since I don't want to carry a large camera around with me. But there's no point in having a portable camera if it doesn't perform. Here's a list of some of the features that were important to me. Surprisingly, this camera met most of them.SIZEThis camera is tiny and easily fits unnoticably into a pocket. Very portable.  CHECK.CONSTRUCTIONMostly metal, feels solid in my hand and weighs more than you would expect for such a small package. Normal Fujifilm quality.  CHECK.LCDWow, oh wow. The huge screen dwarfs anything I've seen on other cameras. Clear and bright in all light levels and my wife can even see it without her glasses! In just the 10 days I've owned this camera, several complete strangers have commented on the screen and have asked for a better look.  Also, there is a one-button-push image brightening function for bright light conditions. Simple and effective.  CHECK.EASE OF USESometimes you just want a point and shoot camera, no fuss, no drama and be prepared to live with the limitations. Everything about my new camera had to be simple - my wife was tired of not being able to use any of our other cameras! The V10 couldn't be simpler - power on, wait about 1.2 seconds, point, shoot. There's some more advanced features buried in the menu system but if you're buying this camera, you probably won't need them or use them.  CHECK.IMAGE QUALITYTake a look at the sample photo I uploaded to the image gallery. I am absolutely delighted with the results produced by this camera - with one caveat - the scene must be well lit with available light. For vacation photos, this camera will excel.  Quality can be superb with low noise levels, sharp images and vibrant (but exaggerated) color rendition which is slightly blue biased. Forget about the flash - it's almost useless except for shots at no more than 6' distance and it WILL produce red-eye (easily corrected in most photo editing packages).  CHECK.ZOOM CAPABILITYThe 3.4x zoom is more than adequate for most needs. When you handle this little gem, you will wonder how the heck Fuji managed to fit all this into such a small package. A miracle of engineering.  CHECK.FEATURESEasy playback was important. On this camera it's the press of one button and half a second later the image is displayed on the LCD. A half press of the shutter button and you're back to picture-taking mode.Video was not so important to me but it's actually very good. The only limitation is that you can't zoom once you've started recording but if you want video, buy a video camera!Games. Yes, you read that right. I have absolutely no need of games on my camera but the V10 has 4 built in. They seem like late 1980's style games but why would you need them?  Well, have you ever traveled with a grumpy child who is 'bored' every 5 minutes. Hand them your camera so they can play the games and although initially they'll probably laugh at the quality, I bet they'll play them and make your trip a lot more enjoyable!Other features include an easy macro mode, easy deletion of images oh, and a sensible length 'lanyard' style strap. For a point and shoot, I'd say this camera is very well featured.  CHECKCAPACITYThere's nothing more annoying than running out of either battery or memory card space. For day to day use, I have found the rechargeable Fuji battery lasts longer than I need. Unfortunately the camera must be plugged in to recharge the battery and it's a pretty slow process (3 hours plus) but if you remember to charge it overnight, you'll be fine. I have already bought a spare battery and will charge it up for use as a spare if I ever do use up the first battery in one day.Here's my first complaint about this camera - what on earth are Fujifilm thinking shipping it with a 16mb XD card?  Save yourself time and order a 1GB card with the camera - that's large enough for 820+ photos at normal resolution.  Yeah, the XD card is not as popular as some other formats, but it is VERY fast - much faster than SD cards.My only other complaint is the charger is far too big - why not just have a small device into which the battery slots? The 'power-brick' and cable approach is so 1990's.So, overall, I give the Fuji Finepix V10 an enthusiastic thumbs-up. At this price point, you will not be disappointed.", "Date": "May 19, 2007"}, {"Title": "Great little camera! A very solid purchase!", "Author": "Vincent Kozlowski \"Casual Geek\"", "ReviewID": "R2VMKPHIJJ3VYU", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "If you travel alot, just like to take pictures, the families designated photographer and cameraman, or just even some one with an artistic eye like myself this camera is definately for you.This is a very solid buy for anyone looking for a good mid-level camera. Perfect for people who take lots of photos, ranging from snap shots to high quality memories and everything in between. More than enough for an average guy like myself, but not quite everything an avid photographer would need.I bought the Fujifilm FinePix v10 in mid October of '06. I put it through 3 months and 4 holidays worth of use, paces and light abuse, and now I feel confident enough to write a review about it. I'm so satisfied it's hard not to be bias, but I will say that this is the first Fujifilm product I've ever owned, so keep that in mind.With a little bit of camera expirience I was able to use this camera out of the box and after it's first charge. Like all gadgets it takes a little while to really run through it's abilities and figure out what it can do. The instructions are nice and easy to follow for begginers, but if you have the slightest expirience with digital cameras, you won't even need them.This camera is pretty small, very light and easily kept on your person, in any pocket. Think, just bigger and heavier and thicker than a deck of playing cards. THe LCD screen is AMAZING. I thought I would feel the need for the old school eye-piece for close ups or landscape shots, but so far this screen hasn't failed to impress me. Likewise with the camera's push button play back feature, i feel like i'm carrying a photo-album in my pocket as much as a camera. not only do i like showing my friends some of my favorite shots with it, but the camera itself tends to attract more attention.The other thing I'd like to point out is just how quick this little guy is. Very little start-up time. With out a stop watch, I make it a 2 count and it's on and ready to fire. Play-back mode is 1 button away, and instantly pops up, you can't miss a photo-op, press the shutter once and you're instantly ready to take another picture. I tend to leave lots and lots of pictures on it, as I went ahead and upgraded to a 512mb memory stick, but even with the stock memory card, plugging into your PC has never been easier, and I would Imagine the same on a Mac. Fujifilm provides software that's almost too simplified for myself, but allows to auto upload your photos. Don't want the software? No problem, Fuji built this little devil with Drag-n-drop abilities to sort, delete or copy your pictures. (you could even use it as a flash drive and bring your work home, it won't play mp3's but i've used it to transport those as well... any files really as long as they fit) This feature, on modern gadgets and media devices is priceless.The only bad things I can say about the camera:  It's zoom could be a little bit better for landscape and scenery shots. But as is, it does just fine for almost everything I use it for. Also, it's amazingly cool LCD screen is also it's Achilles' Heel. If you scratch or crack this screen, it's game over, especially with out a back up view finder. So be sure to register and fill out that warrany card, just in case. and that's that. I've got nothing bad to say about this camera.I will wrap up by saying. If you're an avid photographer, this is a good camera but you might want to aim for something that will let you custom adjust all your settings to take the quality of photo you need. But on the otherside, if you just use a camera for quick snap shots, this baby will do it, but it's overkill, you'll get you're money's worth in the long run, but cheaper, smaller cameras will do for you.However, for everyone in-between, If you're in the market, I can't say enough good things about this camera.

Practically the entire backside is a screen.-Operation:  The downside to having such a huge screen should be limited controls, but thats not the case, I had to play with this camera for 10 minutes to understand just about every important control available.

The best feature this phone has is a mode to shoot 2 pictures with one click.. 1 with natural light, and 1 with flash.

Please Fuji, just give it up with your line of XD cameras, just about everybody is going by an SD standard now.  This takes away the ability to pop it in the SD slot in my laptop.  Because of the incredible price and quality, it's worth the XD hassle, but with SD it would be the perfect compact camera.

I actually bought this (grey) one for a friend, I have the cool orange one (mainly so I don't lose it). The large viewing screen is fantastic! It is clear, bright and easy to see even in bright sunshine. The camera powers up quickly and has a fast response after you snap. The zoom is fast and easy to use.  I really like and use the function where you can take 2 shots (in very fast succession), one with flash and one without and then compare them.

For the price, I feel I got much more than I paid for!", "Date": "March 8, 2007"}, {"Title": "Disneyworld Photo Results Are In !!", "Author": "Paul Kvidt", "ReviewID": "R3RR7R7HY5G9D6", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Excellent experience with this camera after just returning from Disneyworld!  I shopped hard and studied many reviews before purchasing this V10 and it's one of the best purchases I've made.  There's an endless list of cameras and reviews out there so let me tell you what convinced me on this one.First, I really admired a 3-inch LCD and limited my selections to this feature. Since many 3-inch LCD cameras are comparable in price to 2.5 inch I found by going to a camera shop and viewing the different screens the 3-inch is easily the way to go.I purchased a Samsung S1050 camera a week prior to purchasing this V10 and ended up returning the Samsung. The S1050 was a newer model with very limited reviews but had 3-inch LCD, was 10.1MP and even ran on easy to find AA batteries.  However, batteries only lasted for a dozen or so pictures, camera was big and it had some glitches that I mention in my S1050 separate review.I took the V10 to Disneyworld and snapped as many pictures as I could.  After the 2nd day I'd taken approx 200 pictures and battery meter finally dropped 1 notch from full power to 3/4 power. I'd purchased 2 extra batteries on e-bay for 11 bucks and inserted 1 of these into camera for my 3rd day at Disneyworld.  This 2nd battery snapped another 200 pictures and is still on full power.  Also, I used flash on every picture taken so I'm impressed with battery strength. I purchased a 1GB xD card for 24 bucks and it holds over 400 pictures at the highest quality setting.Here's a tip regarding this camera I was unaware of until reading photography advice: A few test pictures I took in full sun all seemed to have dark faces. Of course because the sun is directly overhead it casts shadows on facial features when not using flash. Solution is to keep camera on AUTO with flash. Every picture I took indoor or out used a flash and every picture I took was vivid, bright and clear. This camera takes remarkable pictures and this tip made a huge difference in picture quality for me.Video and sound is excellent.  I took a few video shots with this and it's very smooth and may have made my Hi8mm camcorder obsolete.  With quality of this video I see no reason to lug my camcorder along especially since I'm able to carry this camera easily in my front pocket.  Camera is also fast out of the starting blocks. It seemed to take only a second or two after powering on to snap a shot and was very quick when taking multiple shots.Nice feature on this that allows you to take 2 shots and compare, 1 w/flash and 1 w/out.  However, after using this a bit I realized every shot looked better w/flash so decided to keep this on always as I mentioned above.Features seem fairly straightforward and easy to use and camera is small making it easy to carry around. The 3-inch LCD screen is incredible to use for both viewing and taking pictures.  Of course a bigger camera would allow you to put your hands all over it and not cover up the screen but I believe the small size is important. When Amazon dropped the price of this camera to under $150, purchasing this camera was an easy decision and after a Disneyworld trip I'm truly impressed with the results.", "Date": "June 9, 2007"}, {"Title": "Great gift", "Author": "Harsh Nahar \"Harsh\"", "ReviewID": "R3C84ILD9HNIZ3", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I bought this camera to gift as a gift my mom.

First of all, thank You Amazon for selling it at such a great price! I got it for 139.94. I went to the mall and every store had it for 299.99!!! I was so happy!Anyhow, the thing is awesome. I usually prefer to use the viewfinder because it helps me take better pictures, but I love the LCD. It doesn't eat as much battery as I thought it would, and the lithium ion battery is rechargeable. I was also afraid of dropping it and breaking the screen. While opening the box, I dropped the camera and it didn't break. I fired it on, and played around, it is a little difficult to navigate if you aren't technologically inclined. One of the features that I fell in love with is its ability to take two pictures at once. One with the flash, and one without, so you always get a pretty picture. amazingly, some of those pictures are coming out better without the flash then with the flash, and this is indoors.The fast shutter is so great too! it doesn't steal light quality and gives you sharp pictures, every time.I would definitley recomend this camera to anyone. Whether your a beginner, or an expert photographer looking for a \"play around with\" camera. And if you can get it at Amazon's discounted price, you better grab it ASAP because who knows how long its going to be on sale.

I love it -- and I am a very picky customer when it comes to digital cameras.I had shopped for an affordable yet high-quality point-and-shoot camera for several months before getting the Fujifilm Finepix V10 5.1M -- ever since my wife broke my trusty Sony CyberShot (which was a few years old) back in September.However, at the camera store, the newer CyberShots didn't meet my expectations. And they were over priced. I actually ended up buying a Canon PowerShot SD600... but was so disappointed with it that I returned it a few days later (poor image quality and the \"shake\" warning when on constantly).I took a chance on the Fujifilm Finepix and am glad I did. Fantastic quality photos whether snapped indoors or outdoors. Action photos come out great, too.It's small enough to fit in your pocket and comes with a strap that allows you to wear it over your head like a camcorder. Speaking of camcorders, the Finepix shoots excellent videos, too.It comes with a 16 MB memory card. I suggest ordering a 1- or 2-gig card when you get this camera. You'll need the extra space as the 16 MB card fills up with just 12 photos if you set the image quality at maximum.The only two minor dings (and they are VERY minor) is that this camera uses the non-traditional \"Xd Picture Card,\" and a rare version of the USB cable that connects to your computer (I don't know the technical name of it -- but I have several of USB cables that work with various devices and they won't work with the FinePix). So just keep that cable in a safe place and you'll have nothing to worry about.Get this camera and you won't regret it.", "Date": "March 18, 2007"}, {"Title": "Great Camera", "Author": "Brentley S.

It is smaller than I expected and the controls are well thought out and easy to use even with my big hands, no problems. This is my first camera with a telescoping lens and keep getting my fingers in the way. The LCD is bright and clear, fringerprints are not a problem for me. I just wipe them off with a soft type cloth. I would think in a world where almost everyone has a cell phone they would be used to a few finger prints on the LCD! How many people have you seen wiping their phone LCD on their pants or shirt. Think about it.The shutter response time is great. As soon as you press the release button the pic is taken, no lag.The zoom is fast 1.5 seconds. This time can be changed to 5 seconds if you like.Now for what I dont like. The night time pics (without flash) I have taken are very grainy, dont know if I can adjust on this. I will update later. The Fuji software is sub par at best. Loaded with sale pitches for other items/services. I really do not like this.

If what you're looking for is a moderately priced 5MP camera with a mammoth 3\" LCD, this camera is for you.  It has the basic feature set, including a zoom over 3X and low-light shooting, but also includes neat features like the \"double-shot\" for low light situations.  The camera will take two consecutive pictures: one with flash, the other without.  This handy feature solves those questionable lighting situations where you aren't sure if you're going to light up your friend's face like the Fourth of July and have a washed out black backgroud if you flash.  It'll take it both ways, and let you decide which came out better.  From a value standpoint, it's great.  Add to the fore-mentioned a sturdy camera body (not plasticy like others at the price) and a lithium battery for $160 and I almost want to say \"what more do you want?\".However, it is important to note the downsides.  The LCD doesn't pick up light very well.  Though your picture may look fine once you've flashed, it looks grainy and washed out on the LCD when lining up your picture.  Also, if you're in a low light situation and are attempting to zoom, be prepared to wait for the camera to stutter it's way through the auto focus.  It otherwise takes quick, crisp pictures, but this was a noticeable shortcoming.  Other quirks I noticed were that the battery is not shaped to go in one way, so it is possible to put it in the wrong way if you're not paying attention.  Also, your stance on XD media may or may not play into your decision.  I personally think it is fine, and doesn't really cost much more than other types of media.

If you think you need 7 or 10 megapixels, or that those bigger numbers are automatically better, don't believe it. This thing will produce razor sharp 8x10 prints, no problem. (And how often do most of us make prints bigger than that?) For an all-around family camera, it's top-notch, and the price really makes it a no-brainer.High points:- The screen. It's HUGE. Bigger and better than many cameras costing a lot more.- Image quality. Outdoor or well-lit shots are positively gorgeous, consistently. Poorly lit shots are good (with kind of exaggerated or blockiness in the reds), but this is pretty much universal for consumer digital cameras, from my experience. Still very good quality, though, and the flash works well.- Interface - it's easy to use. I'd rate it superior to the Canon and Sony cameras I've used.- Video - the quality's surprsingly good. So much so, that I actually do use it for video, which I didn't really expect to do. I think you can get about 15 or 20 minutes at its highest resolution on a 1GB card. You can also get more than 800 of its highest-def photos on a 1GB card. I wanted to get a 2GB card, but couldn't find one at the store. Now I'm glad I didn't bother.- Battery life is surprisingly good, especially considering the screen.- Very quick startup time. Turn it on, and bam, it's ready to shoot.- Nice compact form factor with well-placed and intuitive controls.Lows:- the cable that attaches the camera to USB is a non-standard design on the camera end. Not a huge deal, but just be sure not to lose it.- it doesn't come with a separate battery charger - it charges inside the camera. Actually, this could be viewed as a plus, since you don't need to pull the battery out to charge it, as I have to with a Canon I have. Since it gets such long battery life, I don't foresee ever exhausting it if it's charged in advance. Mileage may vary here, of course, depending on your needs.- and I can't think of anything else negative about it, really.Again, for the price, features, and quality, this camera's a steal for $140.", "Date": "May 10, 2007"}, {"Title": "Decent pictures, beautiful screen...

It's not that weird to hold it with your finger on the screen, but it is honestly a bit less than ideal. Anyway, bottom line is, if you care about the picture quality, go for the F20. The camera bodies are very similar, the screen is only a bit smaller on the F20, and you'll be taking sharper, cleaner pictures.I also thought this would be durable. (I am notorious for breaking things.) The screen is very well protected, but I have somehow broken the power  button, from no discernible impact. This may seem like a small thing, but the power button turned on very easily if I didn't have a case on it; things would bump into it and turn it on.

It was supplementing my (4 year old) Olympus C-755UZ. I needed it to take pictures of friends, or slip in my pocket to take on the go easily. However, I was not necessarily expecting it to be comparable in image quality of an SLR, I figured it would surpass my outdated Olympus, but it didn't. It claims to have less noise, but really there is more noise in lower ISO settings than on most other cameras, even though there is relatively low noise at higher ISOs than most. Also, when the ISO is in the auto setting, it tends to boost the ISO way higher than it needs to be resulting in an image that is rarely blurry but very grainy. Also, there is a weak macro function, that struggles to focus in most situations. So it probably sounds like I am totally bashing this camera, but it makes up for it in color accuracy and functionality. The camera powers up incredibly fast, there is very little shutter lag, and the flash charges quickly. However, it tends to struggle to focus in lower light situations, contrary to its claims. Also, the menus are intuitive and even though the controls may be small and squished, they work well and are easy to get used to. The LCD is also amazing. Coming from a screen that is 1/2 the size of this, I am spoiled and it makes me not want to use my Olympus. Skin tones are very accurate, and the manual setting has quite a few white balance modes that are effective. Overall, it is not the most amazing camera as far as image quality goes, but for $130 bucks, it is hard to beat.UPDATE (issue began 4/2/2007-now its 7/5/2007 and the issue still isn't resolved): After several weeks of use, black spots began appearing on my photos. I called Fuji, and they told me to pack it, fill out a repair sheet and send it in (I had to pay shipping for the way there). The repair took over a month (from the time it left my hands to the time it came back), far more than their 7 day turnaround time. When I opened the box up, the lens was reinstalled at an angle, and it caused it to move slowly, grind, and leave visible markings along the lens shaft. I took a few pictures, and when I retracted the lens, it jammed and said \"lens error\". I immediately called Fuji, (might I also mention that they are based out of New Jersey, and are as hostile and unhelpful as the sterotype suggests), but the woman I spoke to sent me a prepaid shipping label, no questions asked. So after another 3 weeks, I recieved it back again, only to find that contrary to the numerous phone conversations during the repair and emails saying the 2nd repair would be covered by the warranty, the rejected it, and spent 3 weeks NOT repairing my camera. I called Fuji once again and spoke to the repair manager, who assured me that it would be expedited, the repair would unconditionally be covered, and that he would personally inspect the camera before it left. Well its been 3 weeks since I sent it in, called twice. First on 6/29 - it will be ready in one week. Then again 7/3, and they told me TWO TO THREE MORE WEEKS! That is the opposite of an expedited repair if you ask me. So when it works, its a great camera, but getting it repaired takes over a 1/4 of a year of dealing with rude people.**FINAL UPDATE** In September, I finally gave up and called the credit company to take action and reimburse me on grounds of a defective product. The requirement for this was attempting to return it to the retailer, which I hadn't even thought of doing so far because the product was outside of the 30-day return window. Well when I called amazon, to my surprise, they agreed to take the product back for a FULL REFUND!! Thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you Amazon! AMAZON IS THE BEST!

The entire backside is the screen!  Some complain that it is a fingerprint magnet (w/nothing to grip) but I completely disagree.  This is a camera that has to be held differently.  Instead of grabbing it, you hold it.  (It rests in your fingers.)  Imagine \"framing\" a picture w/your hands, and that is how you hold it.  Is it 'that' different?  Not really, when you put it into perspective, just be sure to use the wrist strap.  (The Fujifilm F20, for example, has the same screen size, yet bec. of the handle/gripping area to the right of the screen, it takes away from the overall feel of the large screen and really diminishes the `wow' factor.)The V10 is surprisingly heavy/solid for a camera of this size.  With such small dimensions, I would have expected a `lighter' camera.  You can take that as either a plus or a minus...but I have felt larger cameras that had nothing but a plastic body and that felt cheap (prone to destruction) but this baby is solid.  All metal housing.  I read a few reviews where some preferred that the the AV-out and the DC-in flaps were solid, hinged doors but I am okay w/the plastic/rubber flaps.  I guess the same could be said for the plastic tripod mount (I read that in other reviews, too), but for my purposes I won't really be using a tripod w/this camera.My original purchase was to replace/upgrade an older (4-5 years) point & shoot digital camera.  What I have come to like (appreciate) of this camera (besides the monster LCD) is the thin size and small, \"pocketability\".  In a case I bought off the rack, it fits comfortably in my jacket/coat pocket (or a woman's purse).  I cannot do that with point & shoot cameras that have the right-handed, gripping area.  I could get a comparably priced camera w/higher megapixels but it will be a lot bulkier (and since I don't regularly make prints higher than 5x7, the 5 megapixels of this Fuji is fine).As for the high ISO, I would advise you to not use that feature.  Unless you are very familiar w/that feature and how it works on this model, you may be disappointed when getting your shots developed.  (The graininess really shows in the pictures.)  If that feature is important to you (a lot of night, low-light or action shots), then you should really consider a different (more expensive) camera that has very good image stabilization.  I've had point & shoot and digital SLRs and this will definitely not give you the images of an SLR.  (I actually compared images w/a Canon Rebel.)  If you take a lot of pictures in low light or action shots, this `may' not be the camera for you...but for a point & shoot this handles well.I am aware that this camera cannot do it all (when it comes to picture quality), but that is more than acceptable to me when you look @ its features, for the price.  (But if you want a camera to do it all, stop reading here and pay more for something else!!!)  For the money ($[...], including shipping, from another vendor in Feb. 07), this was a steal.  (Granted, the camera was released @ the beginning of '06, but its features still ring true one year later...and that tells a lot about the design behind the camera.)  The large screen, sorting images by date, 30 image viewer @ once, etc. are all amazing.  I have had many digital cameras over the years, and this is great for the price I paid.  (My family was very impressed at one of the nephew's birthday parties.)Battery power is better than I expected.  Being accustomed to changing out AA batteries from my previous point & shoot (and having charged spares in the bag), I expected the proprietary Fuji battery to not have much life.  Well I was wrong.  I had the fear, from other reviews, that I would need to get a back-up (and I may in the future) but I used this camera for a wedding & reception in which I completely filled a 1 GB card w/pictures and movie clips and the battery level never dropped one bar....and now I don't have to carry around all those extra AAs.In general, the menu selections/settings are very intuitive, and start-up (from when you turn it on) is very fast.  The movie clip feature is quite amazing.  Hooking it up to the TV w/the accompanied cable and it looks very much like a camcorder.  (Getting good quality movie clips was important to me when I chose this camera.)Keep in mind, the different sources of information that are out there:  this is the V10, and whether the camera (on the outside) is stock silver, gun metal gray or orange, it is still the same camera.  (Hint:  it doesn't matter what color the outside is, the inside is still the same and will produce the same results...so, if you want this model specifically in orange, and end up reading a review of one that is gun metal gray, it should be the same thing.)For an entry level camera, or even an upgrade, this camera (besides its low price) will outweigh many competitors.  While I am the type of person who no matter what digital camera was used will more than likely manipulate the image through Photoshop or Paint Shop anyway, I didn't have to on many shots.  (I've had the camera for three weeks now.)  Fuji did well w/this model.  For my daily camera, I have now upgraded from a 1.5\" screen to this 3\" baby.  Well, worth the wait (at this price).Overall, this point & shoot camera was worth the money for my needs.", "Date": "March 6, 2007"}, {"Title": "Wonderful for new  and old users!!!", "Author": "Leah B.", "ReviewID": "R2TVZZ0B2BM6EZ", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I bought this item for my mother this past Christmas because she said she wanted a digital camera.

However, as Techjunkie stated, the pictures are very grainy and have a 'water-colored' look when displayed full size on a PC monitor, even though the picture may have looked great on the V10's LCD. This is probably due to the automatic high iso settings of the V10. Most of my pictures default to ISO 640 (not iso 64) when shot indoors even when lighting conditions are extremely bright. I have to force iso 64 or 100 to get decent indoor pictures and to avoid this 'water-colored' look. At first, I thought it was a defect in the camera, but I confirmed this when I also tried a display model at BestBuy and saw the same automatic high iso setting under well lit conditions. Outdoor pictures in daylight default to iso 64 and look great. I should have stuck with a Canon Elph when I was looking for a compact camera for my wife. My own Canon pictures look great indoors without messing with iso settings. On a side note, Fuji even uses a non-standard mini USB connector for their camera which is not compatible with their other cameras. My parents have the Fuji F650 and the connector is a tad smaller than the V10.

Then we took shots from the same angle with the Olympus.  Other than better flesh tones, we saw no real improvement over the old olympus.  The pix taken without the flash were nearly always blurry, and even when not they almost always looked better w/the flash anyway.The LCD finder was pretty cool, and the menus were fairly easy to use (the software I didn't like), and I don't want to dissuade people from buying a perfectly acceptable camera.

A good handful of my images (especially indoor shots) look fine small, but upclose are pretty blurry...almost like they are made out of grainy splotches of oil paint or something.  Kind of hard to explain, but its a little annoying.  The video quallity isnt bad, especially because it has sound too, which none of the other point and shoots i've used before have.  With a 1gb card i can get about 15 minutes of video at the 640 setting, and about a half an hour at 320, and around 800 photos at 5mp (400 something at 5mp fine mode).

I purchased this camera in March 2007. In November 2007, the camera \"froze\", it will not turn on or do anything. I have had repeted conversations with Fuji's warranty department on the phone, and they insist the camera is out of warranty even though I had only had it for 8 months when it broke! It is now March 2008, and I will not deal with Fuji's complete lack of customer service for the repairs anymore, and am trying to find someone local to fix it. For anyone looking to buy this camera, I suggest that you make sure that there is a local Fuji-approved repair shop in your state (there are none in Utah, where I live) so you don't have to deal with Fuji's New Jersey facility for warranty repairs.

It still 'works' but it's like hanging on by a thread, so to zoom you have to kind of hold it in.  For what I paid for it, I didn't want to pay to have it fixed.

I was tired of my Samsung with the unintelligible manual and goofy, non-user-friendly settings. Amazon had the  Finepix on sale for $139! I was attracted by the thin size and large display, and of course the \"try-me\" price. When it arrived, the only thing I was disappointed by was the lack of a carrying case.I've had 4 cameras, and each of them had major drawbacks - mainly in user-friendly settings. I am not an ignoramus, but I have no time to study a poorly-written manual and try to figure out multiple tiny buttons placed all over a camera. I am a casual picture-taker, like most people. So I would end up putting the cameras on one setting and never touching it again. (Can't be bothered to futz.)I love this camera. I love the large display which is also the viewfinder. A friend warned me that when outdoors in the sun, this would be a drawback. It is, since you can't see the display in the sun's glare. But I haven't found it to be terrible. You can still point the camera in the right direction and click! Haven't taken a bad picture yet doing that.I haven't had a bad picture in any light or circumstance so far. The Finepix is very forgiving of shaky hands. I don't know technically how they do that, but I'm certainly grateful.I take food pictures for cooking blogging, and with the easier-to-figure-out settings, I now know how to take better close-up pictures. It only took 10 years and 4 cameras!I would highly recommend the Finepix for any casual point-and-click photographer.

Blake \"RoadMom\"", "ReviewID": "R1Q0KPYIFJ2UN3", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "We ordered this camera for my 14-year-old son, who contributed $70 of mowing money to the purchase.  The picture quality was very nice, and he loved the camera.  He made every effort to be careful with it, even warning me when it was in my possession not to handle the LCD; he did not want it scratched.  After about a week of use it was apparently damaged in his pocket without his knowledge.  He powered on the camera to discover that the display was ruptured (no denting or exterior damage visible), and he was not aware of any cause.  There is no viewfinder, so without the LCD the new $140 camera is worthless.I made several calls to Fuji service to inquire whether the damage might be covered under warranty before going to the expense and trouble of mailing the camera.  There was no clear option for warranty questions, so at least twice I hung up and started over because I could not determine which option to select.  Finally (twice, in fact) I worked my way through the maze of tape recordings to the promise of connection to an associate only then to be immediately cut off. I had no option but to send the camera (warranty paper, proof of purchase, etc.) in.  I included a letter explaining the circumstances.  I received back a form \"estimate\" (actually a pay-ahead bill for the repair) with no acknowlegement of my letter and no explanation, charging us the full cost of the repair, $119.08 to repair the $140 camera.Upon calling the Fuji repair number on the estimate, I did speak with a service representative who lectured me on the necessity of caring for the LCD and explained that nothing would be covered under warranty.  Now we have three options as I see it.  Pay the $119.08 to get the camera repaired, order a new one for $140, or purchase a different camera.  We could purchase a nice Canon (similar optical zoom and MP) with a viewfinder for about $140.  Perhaps Canon might be more responsive if we had a problem.From various other reviews on Fuji cameras I am convinced that, while this Fuji Finepix produces very nice photos and is sleek and easy to use, Fuji service is poor and Fuji is reluctant to cover repairs under warranty.I would advise selection of a camera with a viewfinder (in case your LCD becomes damaged) and possibly a smaller and less vulnerable LCD(the Finepix V105.1 LCD covers practically the entire back of the camera and is very exposed, while my Olympus Camedia 1\" LCD has survived hard use and even drops and scratches and continues working like a champ!).", "Date": "May 17, 2007"}, {"Title": "Fine camera, horrible compatibility", "Author": "ccollett", "ReviewID": "R18QOQUI10XILZ", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "I've had this camera for a few years now and I like it for it's picture taking ability overall. However, the compatibility, or non-compatibility I should say, makes me crazy. It takes an xD card which is not compatible with the standard SD card reader that is built in to my computer or my portable card reader that accepts 6 formats, but not xD. This also means that if I have a problem with my card or want to share pictures with friends, I cant because everyone else is using SD cards. Also, the transfer cable is not a standard USB cable that most cameras use. It looks like one but the part that plugs into the camera is just a little more square than standard. So I always get it mixed up with all my other standard cables and end up loosing it.If you plan to use this camera in isolation and are not concerned with the incompatibility of the card and the cable, then the camera is great. However, if you want a camera that allows flexibility in taking, transferring, and sharing pictures, I recommend getting  camera more standard.As a side note, I am also not happy with Fujifilm's contact us on the their website.

We're in the film business and I wasn't looking for anything high-end, but I did expect more from this thing.- The screen is extremely grainy- The picture is decent quality, but this thing struggles deeply with lighting issues (takes a long time to focus and still proves a soft image or overlit most of the time.)I really wouldn't have many complaints if it wasn't for the fact that I got my parents a Kodak Easy Share 4 or 5mp and it is easier to use and produces much better pictures.  We just got this thing, so I'll keep you updated.Overall, he wanted a thin camera he could hold in his pocket and take anywhere.

Once the camera arrived, I took it out for several test shots under different lighting conditions (indoors w/ flash, bright indoors w/o flash, outdoors closeup & distance). Uploaded the pics to my mac, took a good look, and returned it to Amazon within six hours of the first shot.Looking at the whole picture on the screen, the Fuji's image was noticeably \"soft\", and when zoomed in at all, they looked like watercolor paintings. Noise everywhere, even on shots where I dialed down the ISO. 4x6 printouts were barely acceptable, I'd never go larger. Overall image quality was what I'd expect in a camera from ~2000-2001, not a current generation camera. Compared with my other 5MP camera (an S2IS), these images were not useable. Still, this is a clever little camera that looks great & would be very easy to carry as long as you're not picky about noise in the image.", "Date": "April 30, 2007"}, {"Title": "VERY poor performance at medium-to-high ISO levels", "Author": "AJ Grad \"alex\"", "ReviewID": "R3NNQU8ITDHKCE", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I bought this item from Amazon.

Caruso", "ReviewID": "RO0BKWF8NB5WL", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "I just got this camera. My current camera before I bought this one was a Fuji FinePix A303. I love the A303 and it takes great quality photos for the price I paid for the camera. The only reason I got the V10 was because it has more megapixels than my current camera and also because I liked the design with the large LCD screen and I assumed it would take even nicer photos being that it was a more recent model camera than the A303. After reading about it, it seemed to have a lot of great features and it got great reviews. When I got it I really loved the design and how easy it was to use but I must say I was not impressed by the quality of the photos. I don't know if maybe I got a damaged model but the photos are not turning out very good. I have the camera set on the highest quality setting and the photos are turning out kind of terrible with bad contrast and the clarity is very grainy-looking and the colors are awful. I was annoyed that my older A303, which is only 3.2 megapixels, is taking much better shots by comparison when set up on the tripod in the same setting and with the same lighting.One complaint I have is that this camera has a built-in video game. As a consumer, I would rather a company focus on giving a top-quality product that does what it is designed to do. In this case, a camera that takes great photos. I don't appreciate them adding cost to the camera to add a feature I find useless. I have Nintendo DS if I want to play a hand-held video game. I bought the camera to take photos, which it doesn't do very well, because apparently the company would rather add the video game feature than a better sensor in the camera. Hmm.edit: The camera stopped working only three months after I bought it.  It would not power on with either the ac cord *or* the rechargable battery. I sent it to Fuji company for warranty repair. Their customer service stinks. They said repair would take about two weeks. I filled out the repair form in detail, including my email address, as they said would inform you when they received the camera and find what is wrong with it and keep you up to date on the repair process and when they'll ship it back to you. Two weeks passed. They never emailed me to let me know they received my camera so I called them to see how soon the camera would be finished being repaired and found they did not even register the camera had arrived (almost two weeks prior to my call). The customer service persona seemed annoyed and said someone probably forgot to register the camera had arrived and so no one had even started repairing it yet. Even though my name and address had been written clearly on the repair form they still somehow got it wrong when logging it into the computer. After they corrected all that, the camera was another two weeks being repaired before it was returned to me. When I received it back, it was not even completely repaired. It would only operate when plugged into the ac outlet and would not recognize there was even a battery installed, nor would the battery take a charge, even though the battery was brand new which had come with the three-month-old camera. Needless to say, my next camera will not be Fuji brand.", "Date": "February 8, 2007"}, {"Title": "whats this?", "Author": "gamagee", "ReviewID": "R1JHAEH61W5NRW", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "FUJI FINEPIX V-10 CAMERA, IT OK BUT IT WON'T DO NEARLY THE REQUIREMENTS THAT I HAVE IN MIND.
