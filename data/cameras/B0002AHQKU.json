{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Great camera", "Author": "Bubbles \"Buttercup\"", "ReviewID": "R2Q20BJMVKAWDZ", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "This is a great little camera.  Even w/ the batteries and memory card, it's still light weight.  Sure, there are smaller ones, but the grip on this one made it easy and pleasant to take pictures.  Not only is this camera very easy to use, but it also offers great features.  The features that I liked are: design/style, 2\" led, the use of only 2 AA batteries, button to power on/off (don't like the sliding ones, too many accidents), and it has a dial for selecting picture modes (that's the fastest and easiest way).  Since I only paid $225 online incl. shipping for this camera, I found it to be bargain.Pictures taken outdoors turned out great and very good for those taken indoors.  Still, I'm very content.  The battery does last a long time.  Even w/ the LED on, I was able to take over 100 pics on a single charge before getting a low battery warning.Why am I rating this great little light weight camera a 4 and not a 5?  Because it uses XD cards.  Pls be warned that even though XD cards is one of the smallest and fastest memory card available, it's the most expensive.  That's the only reason that got me to think twice about keeping this camera.  However, after trying it out for a week and seeing the results, I totally love this camera.  I went out an bought a 512 xd card because I'm definitely keeping this one.", "Date": "September 22, 2004"}, {"Title": "Great camera if you want it for the right features", "Author": "Me", "ReviewID": "RAWJ3O1FCICRF", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "For someone looking for a simple point-and-click camera that can be easily operated by the biggest of idiots, this probably isn't for you. The Fujifilm is a good camera for those who are stepping up from the basics, but not yet an avid amateur photographer.Compared to your basic point and shoot digital camera, like the Olympus D-395, this one has many features at a very good price. It's great for someone looking to learn more about photography but not yet willing to spend several hundred dollars if they're not sure they'll become immersed in the hobby.However, those that fit that description should note that it's easy to screw up a picture if you screw with the settings without being sure of what you're doing. But once you get the hang of what happens when you change this and that, it's a pretty good camera to use as a learning tool.As with any other electronic though, you should research carefully and decide what you want it to do the most. For instance, when I decided on a new camera, my priority was to get one with a great macro function. As such, this one was perfect for me. But for those looking for something like night shots as their top interest, I'd suggest something from the Canon A-series.Alright, enough of that, I'll get to my pros and cons for this camera:Pros:- Macro shots. This camera has TWO macro modes- macro and super macro- and they're better than any camera I've ever used. Absolutely AMAZING macro photos. Hell, this is the first camera I've ever used that even HAD a super macro mode, and it was a wonderful addition. If the lighting is good enough, you can take a clear super macro shot without the need for a tripod or any sort of camera stabilization.- Color and lighting. I rarely ever use flash in photography. My white balance is always on auto, and every single photograph has been an accurate capture of the scene's tones and color.- Dark objects in photos. One problem I've had with digital cameras in the past was a very grainy, three-toned pixellated pattern on dark objects in photograph (like a black shirt). This camera doesn't give me that.- Shutter lag. Practically non-existent. You press the shutter button, it takes the picture. There's no waiting, unless you have it on the 2 sec shutter speed, but then, that's not the camera's fault.- LCD. Not only is it larger than most cameras, but the menus are  VERY easy to understand, and Fuji put a durable plastic protector over the LCD, so if it gets stabbed by something in your purse or scratched, the screen won't be damaged at all.- Optional lens additions. The silver plastic ring surrounding the existing lens is removed to allow a lens adapter, which can be used to hold a telephoto lens, a wide angle conversion lens, and any 43mm filter.- Portraits and candid shots. This camera does just fine with human and animal subjects, be it a group shot with your friends or a snapshot of the dog sleeping. No worries there. I've noticed others saying that they've had some red-eye shots, but since I don't use flash, I can't really speak on that. However, given the right software, red-eye can be easily taken care of anyway.- Manual focusing. On any of the 4 manual modes (Programmed auto, Shutter priority, Aperature priority, Manual), you can open the menu and switch the focus option from auto to manual. A pretty cool feature, but it really only does you any good if you're working with a stationary object. Still, it's come in handy before.- USB interface cable. Unless you have an external card reader or a newer desktop PC that comes with several built-in card readers, you're going to need this cable. And really, there's no use in buying a card reader, because this interface works just fine. It can transfer a good 100 pictures and delete the ones on the card in a matter of a couple minutes.Cons:- Flash recycle. If you use the flash, it takes about 5-7 seconds to recycle and charge for another flash.- Tiny viewfinder. This may just be me, since my 35mm has a HUGE viewfinder. I'm just not used to such a small thing. Not that I ever use it that often...- The A/V & USB output ports cover is untethered to the camera. I lost mine within an hour. Fuji DOES include a second one, but I didn't bother with it anyway, since the absence of the cover isn't really that big a deal to me.- It takes a lot of practice to get used to night shots and how to take them. This camera CAN take night shots, but you'll be spending a lot of time learning how to take them to get decent ones. I don't mind the practice so much, but others probably will.- The slowest possible shutter speed is only 2 seconds, which is sort of weak for long exposure photography (probably part of why night shots are difficult).- The fuction dial is way too easy to turn. Before you take a shot, you have to make sure it's on the mode you want it on. (I once tried to take a candid shot in a crowd, only to find that the dial had flipped over to night shot! Needless to say, that photo didn't turn out).- Included software is pretty weak if you're used to having a lot of control, like with PhotoShop or PhotoStudio.Accessories that are a MUST:- A tripod if you do night/landscape shots. Also good for some macros. A $20 3-way pan tripod will work splendidly.- NiMH rechargeable batteries and a charger. This thing will eat through disposable AA's in no time.- Higher capacity xD card. The 16mb included card will hold 11 photos at 5mp normal. A 128mb will hold between 90 and 100 pictures at 5megapixels normal, and about 50 at 5mp highest quality (5mp normal is just great anyway, so there's not much need to go higher).- For those who dabble in photomanipulation or basic editing, a copy of Adobe PhotoShop or Arcsoft PhotoStudio is recommended.- If you dislike wrist straps as much as I do, a cheap case with a shoulder strap or belt loop is a good idea. It'll fit in pretty much any small camera case, so you may even have one already (I use my dad's old Minolta case with a belt loop; fits just perfectly with room for batteries and the USB & A/V cables).So, as mentioned above, it really depends on how you want to use this camera. Those looking for an inexpensive camera with excellent macros should DEFINITELY consider this one. I have yet to find a camera with better macro shots under twice the price of this one. But those interested mostly in night and very low lighting photography should look elsewhere.", "Date": "October 7, 2005"}, {"Title": "Not as good as I hoped", "Author": "Frank W. Mercer \"xsrider\"", "ReviewID": "R3C52O558L9I4G", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "I purchased a Fuji E510 in December.  Over the past few months I have taken about 1000 shots.  I purchased the E510 because I wanted a camera with manual controls and close-up capabilities that my older Fuji FinePix A210 did not have.  The E510 is small and easy to use.  Taking pictures is fast and easy, and battery life it excellent.  Close-up pictures of flowers are clear and crisp.  Portraits also look excellent.  My big complaint is that wide angle landscape shots are not sharp.  Buildings, backgrounds, and landscape shots all look fuzzy.  My older Fuji FinePix A210 (only 3 megapixel) yields much better shots outdoors.  If you want to take wide angle pictures outdoors, of mountains or cityscapes, for example, I would not recommend the Fuji FinePix E510.", "Date": "April 11, 2005"}, {"Title": "Not for the Amateur", "Author": "Surfseventy8", "ReviewID": "R1MCYTRMAGITW7", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "This camera is amazing!  I love having most of the settings on the top of the camera instead of having to navigate around on the LCD screen.  Also, I love the fact that the flash pops up giving me the option to not use it, although the camera has a flash warning icon.  The macro and super macro are seriously amazing features and were the deciding factor in selecting this camera.  If you are familiar with digital cameras as well as the old school photography including shutter speed and light meters, this camera is simple to use right out of the box.  I barely glanced at the instructions before I started shooting a buch of great pics.  I read them thoroughly after becoming familiar with the camera and they are well written and easy to understand.  This camera gave me a lot of control in how I want my pictures to come out.  The LCD screen is huge. 2\" lets me see everything I need to before taking pictures so I hardly ever use the viewfinder.The reason I say this is not for the amateur is because it does have a lot of features.  When given so much control, if you don't understand how to use all the features to the best of your ability and different lighting and depth, a lot can go horribly awry.  This is not the typical point and shoot digital.  If you are looking for something with a few bells and whistles and easy to use, I recommend the Fuji A340.  It has 4 megapixels and is virtually fool-proof.  I got one for my Dad for Father's Day this past year and it's so easy to use that even my Mother can take great pictures (sorry Mom)!  For the most part, i've found that both these cameras take great pics that are of comperable quality when set to their highest resolution.  Both are about the same price.", "Date": "August 17, 2005"}, {"Title": "GREAT camera, it's exactly what I was looking for . . . .", "Author": "C. Good", "ReviewID": "R3QZM4OI23GG5Y", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This is a wonderful camera that does exactly what I wanted it to.The macro & super-macro functions work wonderfully.  I took some pictures outside when it was overcast and getting on towards dusk, those pictures came out better than I dreamed.  I also took some pictures with the flash, that works great as well.The camera takes 2 AA batteries, which is nice and generic.What is REALLY GREAT about this camera is all the different modes, including modes where I can set it for aperture priority, speed priority, or I can adjust the ISO mode.  As someone who grew up using her dad's SLR, I was leery of getting a digital camera because of the lack of control.  But this camera lets me add that control, and all for under $300.Additionally: - The handle design is great also. - The instruction manual is laid out well and easy to read. - While the controls are not the most intuitive I've ever seen, they're laid out in a good pattern and once I read the manual, I doubt I'll ever forget them. - The bundled software works well. - And the option to attach telephoto or wide-angle lenses is very welcome.I've already told my mom how great it is and I recommend it to anyone looking for a good intermediate camera.

Hawthorne", "ReviewID": "RYJNFN03W0VQ0", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "After doing a fair amount of research in stores, I settled on this camera and a good price on Amazon.  It's small enough to carry anywhere, but not so small that it's awkward to hold -- in fact my favorite design element is the grip that's easy to hold with one hand.  This was an upgrade from my 3 megapixel kodak camera, and the pictures have been fantastic so far... and I haven't even begun to explore all of the bells and whistles yet.  But definitely a great camera for the price!", "Date": "September 19, 2004"}, {"Title": "great little general camera", "Author": "Gerald Peterson", "ReviewID": "ROQ2YA1TBBGIS", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "This is my second Fuji brand camera - the menu system is very easy to use. I bought this camera because I wanted an inexpensive (I paid $170 total) general camera that was small yet functional. I will tell you the pros and cons.PROS:1 - 28mm wide angle, this is awesome! Try to find another camera with that much wide angle that is not a DLSR or overly expensive. This feature alone makes this camera worthy of being your travel camera for the landscape shots.2 - Fast start up and relatively fast picture taking (not necessarily several frames per second but your first general picture shot is quick).3 - runs on AA batteries. You will never have problems with battery availability and the battery life is very good.4 - xD card format. Forget about what the previous rating said xD cards are the way to go. They are the newest technology, extremely fast, reliable and durable. So what, you pay $10 more than for an equivalent SD or compact flash - it is worth it!5 - nice size, this camera is small but it has a nice feel and heft to it. It will fit in your hand firmly and your pocket comfortably. The lens hides away quickly and safely flush within the body.CONS:1 - Only 2 AA battery power, unfortunately having AA is great, but only having two means flash takes a wee bit more time to charge up than what I would like. Not a total bad thing, but noticeable.2 - 3.2X optical zoom. Now days this is the bare minimum and you would have expected Fuji to have done better ~ like 5x or at least 4X at the minimum.3 - 5.2 MP, not bad but then again not really that good anymore. Still the quality of the pictures is outstanding, so for most photos you are fine.4 - weak flash, not really good for more than about 6' to 8' maximum. A little disappointing, but with only 2 AA you can't get much juice for flash anyway.5 - 2\" LCD, the clarity is impressive, but 2\" is no longer the standard 2.5\" minimum is.OVERALL:In summary this is a great camera. Especially if you just need a general travel camera that would be great for hiking, walking tour excursions, ect. I highly recommend it!! The only drawback and what prevents me from ranking it a 5 is the slow flash recharge and the short flash distance. Other than that my CONS are mostly wishful thinking and my PROS are very satisfying for a camera of this price and usefulness.", "Date": "December 19, 2005"}, {"Title": "Wonderful Camera!", "Author": "Modern Art Snob", "ReviewID": "R205AWW5RNP8VB", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I LOVE this camera!

The xD card was kind of expensive, but well worth the money.I didn't give it 5 stars because of the extra money I had to invest to make it usable (i.e. the batteries and the picture card.)

It has the solidity, heft and optional manual functions that seem right to folks who started on 35mm cameras, takes clean pictures and seems built to last.Like all digital cameras it eats batteries, so a charger is a good idea. And 5.2 pixels is ridiculous overkill for any pictures that you don't plan to blow up to poster size. At the camera's lowest resolution setting you get pictures that are sharp enough for general purpose photography--snapshots, email and website photos.Prices on digital cameras have gone down so fast in the past couple of years.
