So far it has exceeded by expectations. The pictures are excellent with the others features making it more than I had hoped in a camera. The long term durability of the camera remains to be seen.  I am a Nikon Camera owner for many years.  I have F-3HP, F2 w/MD, FM2 w/MD, N60, and all the old AI lenses to go with them....  Digital is a different world. Instant verification of your results...can't be beat.  Auto Focus...wonderful.  I still sense some lag in the digital systems as opposed to the instant results of the OLD School cameras.  Ask me how I feel in another year....I have the 18-55MM & 55-200MM lens for the camera and it appears that is all I am going to need...a lot less to carry and a light lighter...vibration reduction is a blessing...My camera price was good as I purchased a refurbished by Nikon camera...no problems so far.  Wish me luck.", "Date": "June 12, 2010"}, {"Title": "Excellent camera, excellent price", "Author": "Jorge Marte", "ReviewID": "R3QEBBLUOBSC69", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This is excellent camera for its price.

It takes great pictures and is a breeze to carry. Size is just right. I usually use it to capture outdoor nature and wildlife shots. Recently I used it for the wedding of my son. I did a better job than the \"professional\" photographer they hired. They were paid 4k. Anyway, am looking forward to purchasing a few more lens to add to my collection of Nikon lens.", "Date": "November 10, 2011"}, {"Title": "Impressed from the first hour...", "Author": "Jimbo \"Jimbo\"", "ReviewID": "R34VC216F42TIF", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Coming from the D40, I was a bit hesitant to go up in size and weight.  I must confess, I LUV my D40.  I am biased by Ken Rockwell, so you folks out there who don't care for him, stop reading here.  I also read dpreview a lot and adore that website.  My son has just joined the yearbook staff and he wants to be the lead photographer, so my plan is to let him get started with my D40, whilst I progress with my this D5000.  I also have been salivating at Costco for the last year, but that $900 price tag was keeping me at bay.  Then comes along this sweet deal.  So, I took the chance, and I must admit after a few weeks and about 500 pictures, I'm hooked.  I have taken the D5000 refurb and used my older DS 18-55 lens, plus taken the refurb DX 18-55VR lens and connected that to my D40.  Folks, I can't tell the difference between the two.I have noted, the D5000 is more advanced and that means more \"difficult\" to learn for setting changed on the fly.  But, having come from the D40, I do understand it will take me a while to learn the patterns for changes.  The video mode is superb.  I have not hooked it up to my plasma yet, but I'm sure it will be crisp.  On my mac, its impressive, and the audio is acceptable.  I will be leaving the video camera home in most cases now.The package came in 3 days, professionally packed w/warranty documents.  The camera/lens was perfect.This is my initial review.  I'm still learning, but thus far...I'm one VERY happy camper.  Adorama is the best!", "Date": "May 29, 2010"}, {"Title": "Nikon D5000x", "Author": "Reza Koohnavard", "ReviewID": "R1E8PRUBYIKYI2", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I really like the camera, its not too heavy & not too big.I thought that the video camera is going to be really good like high quality. It is HQ but i was expecting more... but i really love the video camera in fact I have already done 2 videos by filming with the camera in 2 weeks!I was happy that every thing came with the camera. I was even expecting that the camera will zoom in 12x. Like my old digital camera. But its ok, cause I realized that you have to buy a better lens.Its takes really good pictures, you can change the focus and you can take a picture really close even you have flash, cause some cameras when you take a picture really close with a flash, it often goes really light.& when you take a picture when you move really fast it takes a picture & its not blurry its like you toke a picture that you just stand still.", "Date": "July 7, 2010"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": "Unavailable", "Features": "12.3-megapixel DX-format CMOS image sensor: Coupled with Nikon's EXPEED image processing and NIKKOR optics, breathtaking picture quality is assured.\nDurable, high precision shutter: Testing to over 100,000 cycles assures precision and long shutter life\nBuilt-in image sensor cleaning: Effective 4-frequency, ultrasonic sensor cleaning keeps images spot free.\nLow noise ISO sensitivity from 200 to 3200: Engineered for exceptional low-light shooting.\nOne-button Live View: Easy Live View access offers 4 autofocus modes, including Face-priority AF.", "Name": "Nikon D5000 DX-Format 12.3 Megapixel Digital SLR Camera Kit - Refurbished - by Nikon U.S.A. with Nikon 18mm - 55mm f/3.5-5.6G AF-S DX (VR) Vibration Reduction Wide Angle Autofocus Zoom Lens, - Refurbished - by Nikon U.S.A.", "ImgURL": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/31dl-wTqS5L.jpg", "ProductID": "B0034FEB1W"}}
