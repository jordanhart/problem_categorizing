If you have time to set up/test different settings, it's not a problem. If you're in a fast paced environment and taking numerous photos in changing conditions, you'll want ETTL (and preferably not sitting on top of the camera!)Thats where this cable comes in! It basically extends the hot-shoe on your camera. Problem is, it's EXPENSIVE and not perfect.PROS:Extend flash off cameraMaintain ETTL connection\"Solid\" line (whereas wireless or line-of-sight transmission could be interfered with).Tripod mount on bottom of flash-connection (so you can put it on a monopod/tripod and walk around with your camera, not having to hold the flash)Maintains Canon \"red-laser\" focusing (the light that emits from the front of the speedlite, to help you focus)CONS:Expensive! About 10x the cost a PC-Sync cable, and 3-4x the cost of 3rd-party brandsShort cord (the 2-foot length is \"uncoiled\" - it comes Coiled, so you need to pull on it to get that maximum 2 feet, and doing so pulls on the cameras hotshoe).If you only need the 2-feet maximum and can afford it, go for it.If you're on a budget or need a little more slack, look into the 3rd-party brands like Yongnuo. You can pick up a YONGNUO 10m 33ft TTL off camera Cord OC-E3 c for Canon 430EX 530EX for about 2/3rds of what the canon costs, and this one had a 33 foot reach (uncoiled). For about 1/3rd of the price, you can pick up one of a similar length to the canon, and it works just as good.One downside to all of these E-TTL cables (Canon and 3rd party) is that they're a bit fragile. If you pull it too tight, or drop a flash and it pulls the cord, they can tear or lose connection easily, forcing you to purchase another cable.If you don't need the TTL capability, look into a wireless transmitter for your flashes!

That way you can hold the flash off to the side, or above or below the subject in order to control shadows.  You can also mount it to a flash bracket, light stand or tripod, although the cord is only a few feet long when fully stretched, so the stand needs to be close to the camera.The OC-E3 is an improved version of its earlier OC-E2 version, although it has one shortcoming.  The improvements are (1) a more secure and better seal between the foot of the flash cord and the camera's hot shoe and a (2) slightly stronger design for the foot you attach to a tripod, light stand or bracket.  That foot is plastic rather than metal.  It's tapped so you can attach it to a standard \u00bc x 20 tripod thread, or fit it into a \"cold\" flash shoe on a bracket. The foot appears to be stronger than the failure-prone one on the old version, the OC-E2.  But if you attach it to a bracket using a cold shoe, treat it gently, especially if you attach a heavy flash like a Canon 580 EX.  If you bump the flash head or push it too hard the plastic foot is likely to crack.  A bit less caution is needed if you secure it using a tripod screw, but even then you need to be gentle when you start handling the flash head.The foot on the OC-E3 could have been made of fiber-reinforced plastic rather than the weaker unreinforced plastic that's used.  (It would be great if the foot was metal but that might short out the flash if is was noubted on a metal fitting.) I bought a 3\" long 1/4x20 threaded thumb screw so I could sttach it through the threads in the foot, and that helps secure it when it's mounted it on a lightstand.", "Date": "May 1, 2009"}, {"Title": "A necessity, but too short!!", "Author": "Amazon Customer", "ReviewID": "R106YXHAKJBELC", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "A flash extension cord is a necessity for any serious amateur or professional.  The Canon OC-E3 is the one to use with your Canon 430EX or 580EX II, as it supports the all important ETTL II.  Unfortunately, the OC-E3 won't work in all real world assignments / pleasure situations.Canon missed the functional mark by making the cable length only 2 feet coiled and 3-3.5 feet extended.  As it is I can't spread my arms apart, around, or above an object without the cord getting into the frame.While the provided length is better than having the flash right above the camera, two feet just doesn't provide the necessary artist freedom necessary.Obviously Canon's considers situations requiring lengths longer than 3.5 feet are when you should go wireless.  They are wrong, as any distance within your reach justifies the lower wired cost.  The cable's actual length should be your reach plus several additional feet to allow for wrapping the cord outside of the camera's frame.As for how long the OC-E3 will hold up with daily usage, I don't know.  I recently got mine and haven't tried it in my normal routine.As for what I'm going to do about the length, I'm not sure.  I may look to modify the cord as another reviewer did with female CAT5 connectors.  My concern is how the modifications will stand up in wet weather.  I suspect in the end, I'll keep the cable as it and use it for applications with a strobe frame, doing close up, macro, or tent work.As for applications needing longer lengths, but don't justify wireless cost (or carrying the extra hardware), I'll keep looking for a longer cable.  Unfortunately, it won't be a Canon product (as Canon doesn't make a longer cable), but that is their loss.This cable is not worth the price Canon is asking, as it works in too few applications to justify the cost.  Please don't get me wrong, I see where a short cable is very useful and necessary, but I'd suggest looking at a third party cable that is the same length (reflecting the reduced number of applications this cable covers).  Unless you'll never need the cable to be say 6 extended feet (or as I suspect 6 to 8), in which case I'd say the OC-E3 is the one for you.", "Date": "July 15, 2008"}, {"Title": "Unreliable and expensive", "Author": "Scott W. Larson", "ReviewID": "RC7DBWD78VXVB", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "Canon is on their third version of a simple cord to connect a flash to their cameras. That alone says something.I've owned cheap and unreliable photography equipment, however this is the only expensive and unreliable photo equipment I've ever owned. I own two Shoe Cord 2's and nothing has caused me more panic and disappointment than having these cords fail to do their job right when I needed them. When they fail, the flash (550EX and 580EX2) will fall into TTL mode, it will no longer get lens information from the camera resulting in wrong exposures, and sometimes will not fire. When this has happened, I've had no choice put to put the flashes on the cameras.I had hoped that Canon had fixed these problems with version three so I bought one. I was glad to see that the shoe had a metal base for (presumably) a more solid connection to the camera. I was disappointed however that just like version two, the foot is plastic meaning it will eventually break and the plastic threads in the hole for the bolt will eventually strip causing your flash to wobble loose and fall off your bracket. After a few months of use on a bracket, it began to fail in exactly the same ways as version two.The problem is simple. The metal shoe that holds the flash is very thin metal and the weight of a flash bends the corners up. Now the flash will wobble forwards and backwards in the shoe and the last two connectors on the shoe (the ones that deliver ETTL information) no longer reach the foot. You can see how thin the metal is by holding it next to the hot shoe on a Canon camera. The metal of the flash shoe on a camera is over twice as thick as the metal on the cord.One cheesy way to \"repair\" this is to mash the metal corners back down with pliers and adjust them with a flat screwdriver so your flash slides in tightly. I did this to all of my three cords and they now work. For the moment. It beats spending another $70.Instead of the Canon cords, I've been using two much cheaper cables by Pixel.Pixel 3.6M /10 FEET E-TTL Off-Camera Shoe Cord for Canon DSLR Flash 580EX II 550EX Canon 430EX II Canon 420EX 380EX replaces OC-E3bThe foot is also mostly plastic so the flanges are guaranteed to break. Instead use the threaded hole which, unlike the Canon cord, is metal and solid so it will stay on your mount. The shoe on the camera side has a metal base and the shoe for the flash is also metal but it's thick metal like the shoe on a Canon camera. I believe that's why it has been so much more durable. I've put this cord through some tough assignments which put the flash in awkward positions (including putting the flash on a monopod to light up team huddles from below) and they have not failed.

I bought the relatively expensive Canon OC-E3 off camera flash cord as I wanted something that would last a while.  To give you an idea, the Canon version generally cost about 3.5x most third party cables.I got a nice travel flash bracket that would allow me to rotate the flash when I rotated the camera.  The Custom Brackets CB Digital-T Flash Rotating Bracket.I loved using the flash in this manner and took a lot of Christmas pictures using it.  This allowed me to redirect the camera lighting quickly to where I wanted it.  This also encouraged me to use my flash more often.However,  at one point, I put the flash in a vertical position, like I generally do, and the holding plate that my flash was attached to came off.  I watched the flash bounce off a table on its way to the carpet.  Thankfully, the flash survived the tumble and is still working.  Looking at the flash cable however, the plate came off with all 4 screws.  A couple of wires will need some soldering work in order to re-attach it.  However, I was concerned about why this cable disintegrated on me.  The use I gave it in the last 7 months, since the time of purchase, has been relatively light.  Using it at Christmas was the first time I really enjoyed it rather than just testing to see how well I would theoretically like it.So I called Canon for to exercise the warranty on this product as I've had it less than a year.  The Canon representative informed me that there is no warranty on accessories and there is nothing that they can do for me.Looking online, I've found that these things are intentionally designed to come apart if there is any type of impact in order to preserve the flash.  However, the flash falling off during normal use would cause more of an issue as my experience would indicate.Paying a lot more for the Canon version would make me think that this item would be a lot better quality than other items.  I've been really pleased with it up until now.  However, I don't believe this thing is worth the price for only 7 months worth of use.So now I'm debating on trying to repair it myself, or buy a third party cable hoping it has better quality than Canon.Summary if you buy this cable:Treat it very delicately.Be prepared for it to suddenly disintegrate.", "Date": "December 26, 2011"}, {"Title": "Cheap plastic bracket", "Author": "v1s \"v1s\"", "ReviewID": "R3KWFFYEBADQU6", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "will break with the weight of your flash - with any sudden movement, just not worth the cost - better off buying radio remote", "Date": "September 5, 2011"}, {"Title": "Works as it should", "Author": "Joseph T.

The mount is on the camera hot shoe and it clicks in place by moving a lever.  To unmount this, there is a safety button that must be pressed to release the mounting lever.  This helps to keep the mount in place while doing an active photo shoot.  Comparing both sync units side by side, the Canon cord is much more durable and solid.  I was a little concerned over Opteka's mount to the flash and although I locked my Canon speedlight unit onto the mount, the Opteka felt unsure and I was concerned over breakage.  But since the Opteka never worked for me I didn't have to worry about the flash falling off.For off-camera use the sync cord is a must.  I've read in another review that the cord is too short.  In that case use a transmitter, buy another sync cord to daisy-chain it, or allow the Canon camera to fire the compatible flash unit.  It works very well.So I go back to my original thesis, and that is if you are spending serious money on your equipment, stick with the original thing.  Yes, you will pay more for the accessories but then again it IS designed to work in concert with your camera.  That's why you bought the Canon system in the first place.

Yesterday I mounted a 430EX II and as I placed the camera on the desk the flash ripped off the shoe. Turns out all that was holding the flash on was 4 soldered wires. The looseness was caused by 4 small screws which had come unscrewed. They are underneath the metal plate so there is no easy/apparent way to get to  them to tighten them.
