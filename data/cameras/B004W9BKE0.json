Goldstein \"toys for big boys junky\"", "ReviewID": "R2SKB59U5FRB6X", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Thanks to one or two other reviewers that assured us that this drive could be swapped into a TiVo, and that the TiVo would automagically format and update it without any user intervention. But, they did not cover the low-end Roamio model.  With that reassurance, I ordered this drive to swap into my TiVo Roamio which comes with only a 500GB drive installed.  So, I swapped drives without ever having fired up the TiVo, and know what? the reviewer was 100% CORRECT.  It took about an hour after I plugged in the TiVo to be fully ready to roll, after my first having registered the TiVo on the 'net, and then connecting it to my home WiFi network.  The drive is quiet: I can detect no noise coming from the TiVo.  The top of the TiVo Roamio is a bit warm, but I have no idea if it is any warmer than if I had left the original smaller capacity drive installed.This pertains to the low-end TiVo Roamio model, the only new TiVo model that works with an over the air HD antenna, which is my use, having just cut the cable company cord. The hardest part, should you be interested in swapping out the original drive, is opening up the case.  An earlier set of directions that I found with a web search mentioned removing two screws from the back and sliding the case forward to reveal the innards.  Not so with my case.  I finally realized that I had to pop the lid off the case after removing only the middle screw from the back (Torx driver).  But, this is not the easiest thing to do because the lid is secured with several integral plastic pressure clips.  I was too lazy to go to my tool stash to retrieve a sparger, so I used a blunt-nosed table knife and inserted it CAREFULLY so as not to break any clips.  Other than that, it was just a matter of unscrewing some screws that held the drive in place using Torx drivers.  First the brackets that mount to the chassis (three screws), and then the four screws that secure the drive in the brackets.  Unplug the SATA connector; reverse the process using the replacement drive; snap the lid back on, and you're in business.Now I have more storage capacity for recorded shows than I will conceivably ever need.", "Date": "October 13, 2013"}, {"Title": "Works great as Tivo Roamio upgrade drive.", "Author": "Wing Wong \"Winged Power Photography\"", "ReviewID": "RZKDRKK2DGFSL", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "If you got a Roamio Plus(1TB) unit and wanted the capacity that the Roamio Pro unit offers, this is a great drive to facilitate an upgrade.Same type (Western Digital AV-GP) drive.

Great price for 3TB, but the read speed is not what I expected.Using Linux to write zeros to the entire raw device took ~7.5 hours (~135MB/sec according to dd, ~120MB/sec real-world according to iostat) with a low of ~77MB/sec(iostat) nearing the end of the 3TB.  Pretty respectable for a logical 512/4K actual sector drive.However, READ speed is hovering at almost exactly 50MB/sec for the entire duration so far. It's taken ~39 min to read ~120GB of zeros off the drive to test it. At this rate it will take between 2-3 times as long as the write operation to test every sector, even with the best optimizations I can throw at it (blockdev 8192 and using 2MB blocksize.) :-\\ OK for the price perhaps, but if you want better speed be prepared to pay the price premium for the Black drive model - it's a pretty steep difference...Something to keep in mind tho, as of this writing you also get a *5-year warranty* with the Black model so IMHO you get what you pay for. Do like Ferris recommended and get what you can afford, but that 5-year is the best in the industry AFAIK. Shoutout and massive props to the WD team for RMA's, I have never had a problem with them in the last 10 years or so; you can even advance-ship the replacement drive and send your RMA back to them in the same packaging.As others have said, this drive is amazingly quiet. For my usage, it will probably suffice as it will be the sole backup drive for a 2TB RAIDZ2 array - heavy on writes/rsync but not so much reads. Enabling compression on the FS may help; YMMV.", "Date": "January 23, 2014"}, {"Title": "great drive", "Author": "netman", "ReviewID": "R2WK3AU785KSN0", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "WD makes great drives, and if they fail their service is knowledgeable and prompt.

Lyon", "ReviewID": "R3AR7Z0UP22KQH", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I have a SageTV multimedia system in my home.  I put this into my SageTV Windows Home Server to upgrade the storage.  I chose this HDD because of it's size and purported DVR/multimedia features.SageTV is a like a TIVO on steroids.  My system can record 4 different HD video streams and playback to multiple locations (TV's and Computers).  The streams are received via a silicon dust HDHomeRun.Unfortunately, this drive would not start up quickly enough for the recording stream to start correctly.  So I received numerous recording start errors and recording halt errors, including when I attempted to record only one stream at a time.  When the recording did start - the first 1-2 minutes of a show would be missing.  My system before this drive and after this drive had rock solid reliability in starting and finishing recordings without errors.  I know it is the fault of this drive because, without changing anything else, when I replaced it with a 2TB WD Caviar Black I receive zero such errors.  The Caviar Black is able to record 3 HD streams at once and playback 2.  I have not tested it any further than that.  This drive would not consistently record even 1 properly.If it was merely a faulty drive I would give it more stars, But this was not a faulty drive, it is the way it was engineered.  It can play back ripped movies great.  It can play back previously recorded shows great.  Just don't expect great recording response.So, while this is touted as a DVR drive, I would caution that it may not work in your situation.Unfortunately, it took me awhile to trace the error to the drive itself, then get a replacement drive, and confirm the problem.  By that time the return window had passed and I am stuck with this drive.", "Date": "October 17, 2012"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": null, "Features": null, "Name": null, "ImgURL": null, "ProductID": "B004W9BKE0"}}
