We have been having a lot of fun trying the different features, and we are very pleased with the quality of the photos. One thing I will note is that I didn't realize that the camera has a built-in memory card. I purchased a memory card that wasn't really necessary, but I probably overlooked this in the description of the camera.", "Date": "June 23, 2013"}, {"Title": "Panasonic Lumix ZS20", "Author": "Kevin Gold", "ReviewID": "R2S4V1ULLZABQH", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This is an excellent camera.

It's on the middle left so it is not an area that you could easily edit out.  There are other reviews of this camera (listed without the cloths)and there is another person with this exact same problem.  I looked into sending it in for repairs but that starts at $160.  And it appears that Panasonic does not honor its warranty. I have taken very good care of this camera and I know I did nothing to cause this.  I feel bad that I put this on my Christmas list and my husband spent so much money on a rotten product.", "Date": "June 1, 2013"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": "$399.99", "Features": "24mm Ultra Wide Angle LEICA DC Lens with 20x Optical Zoom\nFull HD video recording with stereo microphone\n0.1sec Light Speed AF\n12MB built-in memory\nSupports SD/SDHC/SDXC memory card", "Name": "Panasonic Lumix ZS20 14.1 MP High Sensitivity MOS Digital Camera with 20x Optical Zoom (Black) ZS 20- FREE 2 PACK FIBER CLOTH", "ImgURL": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51vLGPHuBTL._SY300_.jpg", "ProductID": "B00BUA4DRU"}}
