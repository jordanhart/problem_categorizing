I like the super macro feature because I take photos of  watch parts that are quite small. I went for the combo pack to save on case, charger, etc. a good deal. The camera feels solid in the hands and is not too difficult to get used to. The photos have come out nicely and for the money, I feel I got a very nice camera.", "Date": "November 22, 2013"}, {"Title": "It is a good camera", "Author": "marissa", "ReviewID": "R2ARR1PQ4T887G", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "I don't know if I would recommend it simply because I think there are better quality cameras out there for example the nikon.  It is a good camera and takes some pretty decent pictures.", "Date": "January 27, 2014"}, {"Title": "Very nice camera and great package deal!", "Author": "Kate", "ReviewID": "R3J3XXABALVLLL", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I have been shopping this camera for months now, when I found this deal on Amazon.  It's a fabulous package!  The camera, itself, is really nice.  I love the way it has a right side grip.....the portion of the camera that let's you hold onto it.  The package deal was outstanding, and now I don't have to buy any extras!  The case holds everything included in this deal.  Love it!  I haven't used it yet, waiting for Christmas, but I will follow up with more, after I've taken a bunch of pics.
