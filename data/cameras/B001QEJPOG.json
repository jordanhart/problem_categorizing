I haven't really looked into any of the advanced features, but from just messing with it for less than 5 minutes I realized that this is the perfect camera for her.  While I need something a little more advanced, this is one of the closest digital cameras that I have seen  to a simple point-and-click camera.  It doesn't have a lot of fancy buttons, which is great because they tend to confuse my mom.  I was able to show her rather quickly how to turn it on, zoom, take a photo, and view photos.  This is all someone with her skill level needs to know how to do.Now I'm sure this camera has some advanced features that I haven't had a chance to see yet, but that's not why we bought it.  I have my own fancy camera that does cool stuff that my mom could never figure out how to use.  Trust me, she's tried.So if you just want a good quality, simple camera for someone who doesn't need to fool with features, then this is a great option at a wonderful price.", "Date": "June 3, 2009"}, {"Title": "Easy Interface, Ultra Thin, Great Resolution", "Author": "Gail Kaku", "ReviewID": "R15O4IVX50RMA7", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This camera replaces a Canon Powershot 400, which started to flake out. The J20 has an easy interface and is quite intuitive. Can't believe the price of this camera.My camera is tucked away in an IPOD case and fits like a glove. Maybe I won't need a camera case. I cut a little hole in the case and wove the camera strap through it. At the end of the strap,I attached a blackberry cleaning pad to it and use it to wipe away smudge marks.Overall, I'm very pleased with the size and weight and performance of this camera. Recommend using the flash indoors - colors are more natural.

I ordered the black J20- the price is great I got mine new for 105$ w/ free shipping. (I also added a transcend 4GB/class 6 SDHC card & lowepro apex 20AW case.)I really like the styling, \"ultra compact\" small size, & 2.7\" 230K pixel LCD. Wish it had a longer zoom. It's just an easy to use point & shoot that fills my needs for mostly taking family pics. 10MP is probably overkill though as most of my prints will be in the 4x6, 5x7 and 8x10 sizes (assuming true photo quality of 300 ppi). I can't wait to try the video mode out, I'll post more later.update: the 640x480 video w/ sound was big & clear, not small and choppy like I expected, w/ my 4GB card the recording time says 50min. To access the video mode you have to select it via the menu, there is no button on the camera itself. The shutter button on top starts/stops the video.Update 2 (after 1 month): I'm a little disappointed in the pics now, because so many I take seem to be just slightly out of focus. Not sure if this has to do with the lens itself or lack of optical image stabilization. Also, there is some shutter lag about 2-3 seconds, which can really ruin the shot you were hoping to get. Ive also had some issues recently where it wouldnt turn on, but removing the battery for a second then reinstalling then it would work.", "Date": "August 16, 2009"}, {"Title": "Great camera", "Author": "Ryan Kamminga \"\"The real deal\"\"", "ReviewID": "R3CXVGINM56E2R", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I bought this camera for work and it is awsome.

I already own a Fujifilm SLR-type camera for more serious photography. However, I wanted a compact point and shoot for family photographs at restaurants, birthday parties, etc. With a more sophisticated camera it is nearly impossible to hand your camera to a waitress or stranger and ask them to take a group photo. When you do the photos often come out blurry, etc. Since this camera fits easily into my pants or shirt pocket, I can take it anywhere. In most instances, you would be hard pressed to tell the difference between the photos taken with my SLR type camera and this one. The different settings (e.g. \"beach\" and \"fireworks\")are intuitive and actually work as advertised. For me, this camera has three strong points: (1) it is the smallest, most compact camera I could find without having to pay two or three hundred dollars; (2) the viewing screen is quite large (my wife and daughter have more expensive Kodaks with much smaller viewing screens); and (3)it can be used right out of the box without the need for reading instruction booklets. I would agree with another reviewer that the lag time between pushing the button and the time the flash goes off takes a little getting used to. However, tell your subjects that you are going to take the picture on \"three\" and push the button on \"two\" and that takes care of the problem.", "Date": "August 14, 2009"}, {"Title": "Disappointed with the Camera and the Company behind it", "Author": "RL \"Ganbatteru-kun\"", "ReviewID": "R1XI3GP89N578E", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "The compact size is great.  However, there is a significant lag in snapping a shot. By the time it does take a shot, the flash is a bit too much.  In regards to durability, the camera stopped working after about five months - wouldn't turn on.We contacted Fuji and although the camera was still well within the 1 year warranty period, they required a store receipt for warranty coverage.  This was hard to believe.  Historically, we've only held on to our receipts for the first 30 to 60 days in the event we wanted to return the product to the store.  We assume (and are correct in most cases) that the manufacturer can easily track the purchase date by serial number.  This was how it worked when I was in the electronics business 10 years ago.And, if you do have a problem, and have your receipt on hand, the battery isn't covered.  Considering an OEM replacement is about 1/3 the cost of the camera, I found this difficult to believe as well.However, all of this was our fault.  This is because it was our second purchase of a Fuji camera.  The first one was worse in terms of performance, so when it quit working, we didn't even bother trying to get it fixed.Should have known better.  Needless to say, we won't be purchasing another Fuji product again.", "Date": "December 4, 2009"}, {"Title": "No durability or company backing", "Author": "N.

Maybe that's strange. I have had this camera since fall of 2008, I think. Maybe it was spring 2009. Either way, I have had the camera for around 4 years. I don't remember what I paid for it. I think it was around $100 new from a department store. I bought it to use as a personal snap-shot-taker and also to use for my job at a pet store, where I took cute pictures of animals with their people to post on our blog. I used it allll the time. To take all kinds of pictures. Then, for about a year, it just rode around in the bottom of my purse, in a protective pouch, of course. I hardly ever used it, but I wanted it to be there just in case. Recently I have been using it more and more and I am grateful to have it!The picture quality is fantastic. In my experience, Fuji has always produced surprisingly GREAT quality images, even in their small, casual cameras like this J20. The colors are WONDERFUL and the focus is accurate, even if it's not lightning fast. (It's true. The camera can be slow to focus.) 10.0 megapixels is HUGE for a little camera like this. But this is a nice feature to have since the (optical) zoom is only 3x. Can't get close enough with the zoom? Zoom and crop on your photo editor on your computer! (Or crop the picture on the camera during playback mode!)As a point-and-shoot, it couldn't possibly disappoint. It is simple to use, attractive and compact.There are features like scene selection, shake reduction, macro, flash controls and timers that also make this camera suitable for more creative ventures. There is even a manual mode where you can set the ISO, white balance, and set exposure compensation. Most people who buy this camera will have no interest in these features, but they are there and they can make a big difference when you want to get a shot just right. I have recently become more interested in creating more artistic photographs, and I don't always have my \"big\" camera with me, so now my \"little\" camera is filling in as a creative tool, and it performs wonderfully. It doesn't give you complete control or fully manual settings for aperture, shutter speed or focus, but if you understand light and the abilities and limitations of whatever camera you are using, you're going to get a great shot!I have never had any issues with any part of the camera malfunctioning. The shutter and lens still function exactly as they did the day I bought it. It zooms in and out with no fuss. It focuses when I tell it to focus and flashes when I tell it to flash (or doesn't flash when I tell it not to). The LCD is not very bright or crisp, but it serves its purpose (your computer is the place to review your digital photos, anyhow) None of the 4 year-old pixels are damaged or burned out. The original battery is still going strong, although I expect to have to replace it someday, when necessary. It has always stored the images perfectly and has never had a corruption.It's a great little camera.The camera that takes the best pictures is the one you know well, and after spending 4 years with this one, we are good friends.
