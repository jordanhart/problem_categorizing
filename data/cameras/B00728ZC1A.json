It is a vast improvement over the TS3 in many respects.  I appreciate the full manual mode in particular.  I like to take shots of the night sky, the stars in particular... the option to set the shutter speed up to 60 seconds is amazing.The time lapse is also a marked bonus as well.  I am a bit worried when leaving the camera in one spot for so long as it may be stolen, but so far I have made some amazing short films.The overall picture quality seems to have improved as well.The only MAJOR PROBLEM is that the manufacturer suggests that the watertight seals be replaced to maintain the water-proof integrity of the  camera.  They have not established what I consider a reasonable pricing structure for this maintenance procedure.  To replace the seal you need to unscrew two screws on the door and replace the seal.  Yet the service department for Panasonic now charges $180 plus shipping costs (both ways) to do this.  I have spoken with the service department and they have assured me new pricing is being considered..so BEWARE!One minor limitation I see with the camera is, beside the repair issue, the menu is a bit quirky and takes a little while to get used to. Another is to keep your finger off the lens, and keep your finger off the mike. If you cover the mike even a little while recording you will record both your subject but also the internal whizzing and other sounds of the camera.I have included some of my shots in the customer images section of the product page.5/8/2012 UPDATE.. Panasonic parts department says you can buy the \"water packing\" kit for about $32.  Part number VUMG 1978.. call 1-800-833-9626 to buy this part. They say this is the part that needs to be replaced each year to keep the watertight integrity of the camera.6/17/2012 UPDATE...  I have just come back from a trip to Japan.  A nice Panasonic repair person told me that the lens is prone to come loose and rattle when off.  This is weird but normal so he says.  The rattle stops when you power up the camera.**I also discovered a neat feature of the panorama function.  When you play back panorama pictures on the camera, when you push the up button, same as when you playback movies, on the camera it makes a movie out of the panorama.  It is like you are there.  Amazing!!6/26/2012 UPDATE...  Just spoke with Panasonic repair person in TX, USA and they have confirmed that they now charge only $50 to change all of the waterproof seals.  (down from $180)***be warned however, they said they will also look for other things to repair and if they find something the price for those repairs (not covered by any existing warranty) will be $180+.**8/10/2012- NEW REPAIR POLICY.  I just spoke with Panasonic repair person in TX again, a new policy has been initiated regarding ts models.  They no longer will question camera leaks if under warranty.  They told me, at least for now, that they will be replacing them with new, not refurbished, cameras of the same model and color.  Good news!!

My intended purpose for this camera was for my trip to Jamaica, which is where my sister just got married. I was in Jamaica for 1 week and took about 950 pictures. I returned home 2 days ago and after reviewing my pictures on my TV and new iPad, all I can say about this camera is WOW!The reason I got this camera is because I wanted an all purpose camera that is water proof but can still take great pictures on a day to day basis. In Jamaica I used this camera for my sister's wedding, to go snorkeling, when we climbed waterfalls, went on a lazy river tubing ride, horseback riding in the Caribbean Sea, and everything in between. This camera took outstanding pictures a majority of the time, but did have some difficulty with night time pictures. The images came out a little blurry for some night pictures, so I had to play with the settings a little bit to try to improve the picture quality. Some night pictures did look great with the night setting, but others did not. So night pictures were a hit or miss.For my sister's wedding, I used this camera for all the pre-wedding pictures as well as during the ceremony which was on the beach. It rained a little during the ceremony (which is supposedly a blessing in Jamaica!) and did not have to worry about my camera failing because of the rain due to the waterproof feature. All the pictures looked amazing.For the underwater/beach pictures and videos, this was my first waterproof camera so I was a little nervous at first going underwater, but I made sure I followed all the cleaning/soaking rules to make sure it maintained its water tight seal. There were times when the lens would fog due to a quick change in the temperature (which is normal). I noticed it primarily happened going from the beach into the colder water. All I did was make sure my camera was dry and opened the side door to kind of equalize indoor/outdoor temperatures. This fixed the fogging issue withing 5-10 minutes. I think my lens fogged 2 or 3 times throughout the whole trip. Again, these underwater/beach pictures and videos looked amazing.The GPS feature is cool because it records your location as well as the altitude/depth and pressure, but it did greatly reduce the battery life (which I knew it would prior to purchasing this camera). I bought another battery so I could easily swap out batteries when one would die. I'm definitely glad I did! At the end of the night, I probably used one full battery and about half of the other (I had the GPS feature on). I'm sure if I turned it off it would have lasted much much longer.After showing my pictures to my friends and family, everyone was astounded that this camera was able to take such great pictures. Between the wedding pictures and the underwater/beach pictures, this camera did it all. I emphasize not just using the automatic setting, however. While the auto setting did take great pictures, I found that going into the scene mode and selecting exactly what setting you'd like for that particular image took even better pictures than the auto setting (especially for night images). I am 100% happy about this camera and I would recommend it to anyone that wants a great point and shoot camera that is also waterproof.", "Date": "April 28, 2012"}, {"Title": "Thought I was smarter than other 1 star reviewers ... I was wrong", "Author": "JK", "ReviewID": "RILY5YWPGFVMS", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "Do not buy this camera / very expensive paper weight.I purchased this camera to take on our honeymoon in May to the Society Islands in French Polynesia.  I read through all the reviews of the TS-4 and TS-3 both positive and negative and thought I was smart enough to not have this camera break, I was wrong.  I followed all the instructions making sure the seals were clear and soaking it after snorkeling (never more than 1hr and never below a few feet).  7 days into our trip, and arguably the most amazing day post-camera death, the camera stopped working.When we returned from the trip I called Panasonic and was told to send to their repair center in TX.  I received a call this week that the camera was out of warranty and it would cost $180 for them to start the repair and I would have a 90-day warranty with their work.  So my 1-month old camera has now cost me 50% more and will have 33% of the original warranty.  The best part, and I'll update once I find out, is that this $180 may not actually cover their repairs...this is just to figure out the repair plan.Getting a hold of a Panasonic representative has been almost impossible.  I've never actually reviewed anything (positive or negative) but I am so upset with Panasonic that I had to.  If this helps one person avoid buying this camera or anything from Panasonic I'll be somewhat satisfied.Update 7.5.12:  Received a call two weeks ago that they could not fix the camera, but would send me a new one for an additional $40 more than the $180 to repair. They told me it would be a new camera and would have 90 days of warranty. I said a standard factory warranty was 1 year and asjpked if it was a refurb unit. They said no and that the factory warranty ran concurrently with the 90days and covered 1 yr. You've probably already guessed that the unit they sent was refurbished and has only 90 days of warranty. They also forgot to send the battery back with the camera...who are these people that Panasonic hires?!  I laughed at the commercial with the US Soccer team showing the new \"tough\" iPad wannabe.

Panasonic will not honor their warranty!I am very distressed that I am forced to post this complaint about Panasonic not honoring their explicit warranty on a Lumix DMC-TS3 \"underwater\" camera.I am an experienced underwater photographer with three underwater cameras and 9 years experience. I have never had a case leakage or any damage to one of my cameras. I know how to care for expensive camera equipment at the beach and underwater.I purchased a new Lumix DMC-TS3 \"underwater and 6 foot drop proof\" camera for my wife to use. She is also an experienced photographer and knows how to care for a camera. We liked the Lumix as an easy to use light weight simple point and shoot for shallow water snorkeling. One its first trip, only 6 weeks old, it failed after only 7 days of shallow snorkeling. It was never more than 6 feet underwater and at all times cared for exactly according to the manual. It was never dropped or otherwise damaged. I was sorry it failed so soon on its first trip but we did have our larger underwater cameras so I was not too concerned. I was sure Panasonic would replace or repair the camera and I would have been happy with that.I returned the camera as instructed to Panasonic certain they would honor their warranty and advertising. I was shocked when they called and said the warranty was void because there was \"condensation\" inside the camera. I carefully explained that the camera was cared for exactly according to their manual and should be under warranty. I asked to speak to a supervisor and was told they would contact me in 3-4 working days. They never called or emailed me. I then called Panasonic warranty service two more times. Each time I got the same answer: the warranty was void and someone would call me but no one ever did. I am now left without a camera. I would never buy from Panasonic again and caution anyone else considering a purchase from them. If you do not care about a warranty and possible early camera failure then buy Panasonic, otherwise BEWARE PANASONIC.

W. Parks", "ReviewID": "RGUR9PM2H13PC", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "We got this camera just prior to a trip to Hawaii.  The camera is about typical for ease of use, and we got some good photos from it.  The video quality was better than expected, particularly the \"anti shake\".  It was very impressive video for a small camera!The issue was when we took it snorkeling.  We followed the instructions, and also did a test in fresh water in the sink and it did fine.  So, we took it on a boat trip to a snorkeling site.  It was in the water for about an hour, mostly just surface snorkeling, but a few surface dives down to about 10 ft depth.  The camera was rated to 40 ft depth, so I figured that 10 ft should be fine.Well, it wasn't.  We got it back to shore, rinsed it in fresh water, allowed it to drain and dry, then opened it.  It was wet inside the door.  The next day it was not working.  So, we returned it to Amazon for a refund (which was processed immediately with no problems).The good news is that the photos and video from the snorkeling survived just fine, and we got some really good video of a sea turtle.  If you do get this camera, note that it has a \"beach and snorkeling\" mode, and an \"underwater\" mode.  The main difference is the color balance.  Even if you are just snorkeling on the surface, try the \"underwater\" mode.  We much preferred the color in those images.Other people have posted similar leaking problems here, and if you look at other, similar cameras, they all seem to have some problems.

I have no qualms lugging around my DSLR and array of lenses on a backpack when I travel, but I really wanted to take pictures underwater and wasn't quite ready to splurge on a $1500 Ikelite underwater housing.Of importance to me:1. Underwater capability2. Image and Video quality3. Form Factor4. GPS, barometer, altimeter featuresAfter comparing the features between this Panasonic TS4, Panasonic TS3, Canon D20, Olympus TG820, and Nikon AW100; I opted to go with this camera.I ruled out the TS3 (previous model) because the TS4 offers manual control and for some strange reason, its priced $100 more expensive than the TS4 despite the TS4 shares all of the same features as the TS3 plus the manual control (exclusive to TS4).I tried out the Olympus and Nikon at the local Best Buy and was very unimpressed with form factor of both- especially with the Nikon. Bet you can guess which side of the Canon vs. Nikon camp I side on? ;-)The Olympus also lacked a lot of the features of this Panasonic like GPS and altimeter. Moreover considering the recent scandals regarding Olympus President defrauding the company... I just think this company has fallen A LOT in the past 15 years.I didn't get a chance to try the Canon D20, but definitely would've considered it based on my previous experience with Canon products. However, of note is that while the Canon D20 does record HD video at 1080, it only does so at 24 fps. It's 2012. Please Canon, this is unacceptable. Get with the program! The Panasonic records HD video at 30 fps.Ultimately the Canon and Panasonic are very similar cameras. They both shoot at 12.1 MPS. Sensor size is roughly similar: Panasonic (6.08 x 4.56 mm) vs. Canon (6.17 x 4.55 mm). Canon Optical zoom 5x vs. Panasonic 4.6x. Both include GPS. Both feature gorgeous metal blue housings. Canon ISO (up to 3200) vs. Panasonic (up to 1600) however, I would surmise that 3200 is basically unusable underwater. Canon f-stop (3.9-4.8) vs. Panasonic (3.3 - 5.9). Canon zoom lens (28-140 mm) vs. Panasonic (28- 128mm)If I had chance to try out the Canon D20 at the store, I most likely would've opted to go with the Canon based on brand loyalty. However, my mother and several friends have Panasonic P/S cameras and I've been impressed with the form factor, build quality, and I still think Panasonic offers the best bang for buck. Of note is that the Canon does have a smaller f-stop range, which is more preferable. I wouldn't put much stock into the Canon having a longer zoom range if you're shooting underwater as you'll be shooting at wide angle at least 90% of the time.As this is an underwater camera review, let's just get straight to the pros and cons:Pros:- After four separate snorkeling excursions, in some incidents where I spent close to 60 minutes in water at depths of up to 7 metres I would say this performed like a champ. On two of the snorkeling incidents, I wasn't able to rinse the camera in fresh water (per the instructions) as I was traveling between beaches, but that didn't have an effect on this camera. I experienced little lens and screen fogging.- I rinsed the camera in fresh water for 10 minutes (per instructions) and dried it out in my hotel room during the evening. Miniscule droplets of water would appear on the rubber seal, but wiping with a towel easily remedies that. Saw no premature aging in rubber seals.- I found the underwater mode (not snorkeling mode) to be more than sufficient for my purposes. I prefer underwater mode as I found that the images are crisper, more true to tone, and the white balance doesn't shift much between images.- Best and most crisp images seem to hover around f/3.3 I think that's the sweet spot of this camera. Which means that you'll have to get really, really close to what you're taking a picture of for best results.- Blue camera is gorgeous. It has a shiny reflective coating, metal housing, and just oozes class. Undoubtedly you'll be taking out the sexiest camera to the big dance.- Pretty good form factor. Buttons are neither too small nor too big. Only gripe is that power on/off button is far too close to record on/off button. Underwater, I experienced no resistance to operating the buttons.- Dropped this camera twice: once into the water, and the other time on a rock (while underwater). No problems for this tough guy. :)Cons:- Screen becomes very difficult to see underwater. Once the sun starts reflecting in the water, forget about messing with the settings underwater. I would press the record button and I couldn't tell if the camera was recording or not. I'd have to surface just to see the small pixelated red dot appear on the screen. Note to Panasonic: Make the recording red dot BIGGER!Next model (TS5?) should have better screen resolution. I realize that there's this tradeoff between screen resolution and battery life, but the screen is almost unusable underwater.- Every time you turn on the camera (regardless if underwater or not) it indicates a warning screen to make sure the internal compartment is locked. Yep-- once, twice is fine. Every time? That just gets annoying.- Zoom is useless underwater. Set the lens at its widest angle (28mm) before you enter the water.- On/off button is similarly shaped and closely located to the recording button. On one occasion, I accidentally turned the camera off when I meant to stop recording.- For an advertised 12.1 MP camera, the images aren't stunning. They're above average, but as a result of shooting underwater, combined with jamming 12.1 MP into a 6.08 x 4.56 mm CCD, you're bound to encounter some noise-- maybe 1/5 of my shots suffer from noise; use Manual mode to overcome. Unfortunately this is the kind of problem you'll encounter with any underwater camera in this price range. But at least it's not the Panasonic TS20 where they try to jam 16.1 MP into the same sensor size.MORE MEGAPIXELS DOES NOT EQUATE TO BETTER IMAGE QUALITY.- HD video is mediocre. The colors are fine. But even at 30fps at 1080 HD, it's still jumpy and lags behind. I can't even imagine how much worse the Canon would fare at 24 ps.- Screen does scratch quite easily.Conclusion: Camera held up through four separate snorkeling incidents. Some snorkeling lasting up to 1 hour and at depths of up to 7 m. Saw very little condensation in the rubber seal, no salt deposits.For a P/S, image quality is above average, but probably tops in this market segment. Some prevalent noise in 1/5 of images. GPS, altimeter, barometer, compass work fine.If you plan to snorkel while on vacation, I do believe that this camera suits the bill. My experience to Curacao has given me much confidence in this camera's capabilities.", "Date": "June 19, 2012"}, {"Title": "Good so far!", "Author": "DTimberLD", "ReviewID": "R3GD8T12OA7A4O", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I bought this camera from another retailer, before it was available on Amazon, because we were leaving for the caribbean and i wanted to get it on time.  I ordered it two days before we were leaving.  I did get it on time and just got back from my trip where I used this for general pictures and for underwater pics.At home, i have a nice Canon D5 - digital SLR - and have used many little point-n-shoot Lumix cameras in the past for my quick, outta the pocket uses on vacation.  I like them for the overall quality, and i'm generally comfortable with the functions because i've used their cameras before.iA (intelligent auto?): these automatic functions took great shots. The general travel pics came out well - even those where i quickly grabbed it to take a pic out the car window with no prep.Underwater:  we got pics of fish & turtles underwater with amazing detail.  I followed the underwater instructions religiously to optimize my chances that it would not leak or have any performance issues.  We did not have any problem.  You must rinse the camera after you use it in salt water and then let it dry.  Followed this advice each day.  No worriers.No Flash combined with Low Lighting: I didn't like using the camera in forced no-flash mode in low lighting because the focus light (that lights the area before you take the shot) was so bright it was obnoxious and blinding people.  It's a small complaint, but for instance - you couldn't use this in a theater where they say only to use cameras with no flash - this light would be as dangerous to those on stage as a flash would be.Manual functions: this was my primary reason to wait to try to get the TS4 instead of buying another model.  Honestly, we got the camera just before leaving to go away.  I could not figure out, without the help of a manual, how to configure the manual settings (aperture/speed).

You have to toggle to \"no\" then hit \"enter\" before it will let you take a picture.  Even if you are quick, start-up takes close to fifteen seconds.

In keeping with my philosophy on wristwatches and cellphones I decided my next camera should also be at least as water resistant as my own body.What originally attracted me to the deceased compact camera was the combination of available short focal length, full manual operation and shirtpocket size, as well as a coupled optical rangefinder and AA battery supply. Finding all of these features combined in a waterproof compact camera is still not possible but the Lumix brackets the most important photo-specific items in the list.  The DMC TS4 offers a 28mm equivalent focal length, complete manual control unavailable in any other compact waterproof camera including the ability to lock out AF and force the lens to infinity focus (which is a must for shooting night scenery, stars etc.) and is readily slipped into a small pocket.Using manual control it is possible to obtain a shutter opening of as much as 60 seconds with this camera. Images obtained this way are very good for such a modestly sized device; it's easily possible to make a shot illuminated by half-moon appear as though it was taken in daylight, with useful color and very little noise. Accessing manual operation is not horribly clumsy though of course it's not as easy as with a full size DSLR.This camera offers a myriad of features accessible from a straightforward interface augmented by a generous array of physical controls.  A brief review cannot begin to describe everything available to the user so instead take a look at the manual which is available at Panasonic's web site.Of particular interest is the built-in intervalometer which allows the camera to do time-lapse sequences. We used this on a recently concluded trip to record pictures from the dash of our car as we toured Queensland and New South Wales in Australia, yielding a fascinating record of the view through our windshield during 2500k of driving.Others have complained about the integrity of the water resistance of this camera. I've no complaints on that score, perhaps because of scrupulously following directions. On our recently concluded trip the camera was periodically clamped to the stern rail of our boat as we sailed around the Whitsunday Islands, and tolerated a night of driven salt spray, 35 knot winds and being periodically bashed by a life ring as we hunkered down during a blow while the camera was neglected and left on the rail. The unit also was pressed into service to take a trip under the boat to investigate a mooring line which became wrapped around the keel as well as being used to take a number of less dire snorkeling snapshots. There were no issues with moisture entering the camera, though admittedly it's hard to overcome a lifetime of experience and let the thing get wet. Following directions worked for us; scrupulously ensure the access door gasket is clean, that the door is shut properly, then (if in salt water) rinse and let the unit become thoroughly dry before opening it.Optical quality is remarkably good considering that the lens is entirely internal to the camera body and in fact makes a right-angle turn within the camera via a prism so as to extend the optical path. As technical review sites noted, images are a bit soft when the camera is pushed to full telephoto length but the effect is by no means obvious and won't be noticed by folks forced to view your slide shows.The image stabilizer performs well, making handheld shots in low light much more likely to be successful. As well, for more extreme attempts at shaky low light photos the camera includes an innovative optional processing mode that takes a sequence of pictures and then merges them to average out movement during the shots. This works amazingly well.In the candy department, the sensors on the camera are entertaining and even somewhat useful. Is it necessary to know the compass heading of the camera when taking a picture? Maybe not, but it's fun. The GPS is also great fun; it's eerie to point the camera at the visitor center in Cobar, Australia and have the camera tell you exactly what you're looking at. Again arguably useful in certain contexts; we're able to exactly locate where all of our pictures were taken during our recent trip. It's also possible to use the GPS to obtain a direct position fix though you'll need a map finish the job of finding yourself.In sum our initial experience in taking some 1,700 shots with this camera in a variety of challenging conditions has been very satisfying. Highly recommended for anybody unable to treat their gear with kid gloves while paying attention to other more pressing concerns.Cons:-- When shooting into or across the sun, shade the lens opening if possible. Sometimes there's a loss of contrast due to light bouncing around in the opening. Not a huge problem, but something to pay attention to.-- No coupled viewfinder (no optical viewfinder at all) means you'll always be pointing the camera in dork mode and won't be able to point it at all when the Sun is hitting the back of the camera at the wrong angle. The LCD screen is fine but it's not fusion-powered, unlike the Sun.-- Panasonic decided to cut the number of available user mistakes by concentrating all connectors, the battery and the memory card behind a single door. This makes for a large and sensitive gasket that does need to be taken care of. As well, the door must be open to obtain data from the camera. I wish they could do the door with a screw-in hatch but there's just not enough room.-- Battery life is good for about 300 pictures. After that, hope you have some means to charge the camera, an extra battery or a sketch pad. Sadly (no room, again) the camera does not take AA cells meaning it won't be much use for that sled journey to the South Pole you're contemplating.-- The camera does not float. Get a buoyant lanyard, or make one.-- Operation with gloves isn't easy, but again that's down to size.", "Date": "August 13, 2012"}, {"Title": "Great travel camera", "Author": "Fake Name", "ReviewID": "R3S8646Q7ZMJM4", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "First off, this camera is the best point and shoot I've ever owned. The versatility and the built in features/modes allow you to capture any situation you come across. To date I have travelled through the Galapagos, Ecuador and Peru and Florida with this camera. I've never had a single problem with the toughness of this camera. I originally bought a small case to toss it in but after using it for awhile I wasn't worried about it getting messed up throwing it in a pouch of my back pack. There are some things I'd like to be better, but they might be a limitation to all these types of cameras though. I outlined them in pros and cons.Pros:Great quality pictures- I have a Fujifilm HS30EXR as well that I used travelling. It's a lot more convient to carry this around. The Fuji has better results in the end but the TS4 compares really well. In an age where 90% of photos are just going to be resized and emailed or posted on Facebook this camera is way more than good enough on quality.Great features- Lots of modes that are easily accessed. The more comfortable you get the faster you'll get at switching modes too. I left it in the iA mode most of the time but picking a specific mode can make a difference and is worth the effort.Size- It's not as small as others but it feels substantial and you can get a good grip on it, which I think is better. I've used a fuji that was more streamlined and it was a little too small. I'd be nervous to use it n water. That was not a problem here. I could fit in the front pocket of my jeans, it'd be better in a cargo pocket though.Toughness- I've gone snorkeling twice a day for a week, had sand rubbed all over it, dropped it, submerged it over the side of a boat  while going down the amazon to see how the pictures would turn out. It survived it all easily. Really is a great and tough camera.Battery life- Battery life is great. I wish I could say how many shots I got before I recharged it. I never use flash and the battery would last two days for me on average. Probably took about a 50-100 pictures a day and left the camera on to get a GPS lock and have it ready for a photo. The battery was never fully drained. I took it on a four day hike where I only had one battery the last day it almost died because I was taking a lot of video.GPS and altimeter etc- Maybe it's kind of a gimmick but I think it is really cool to see exactly where you were. In a worst case scenario the built in compass could probably help you out of a bind as well.Lanyard- The included lanyard is probably pretty standard but it was a good diameter and feel. I say this because I cinched it down to make sure it never got away from me when swimming and I never had any irritation and all the salt water never discolored it or wore it down.Dedicated video button is convenient.Cons:Foggy lens- I have a quite a few pictures that were ruined by fog in the lens. Nothing you can really do about it when it happens and I think it'd be really difficult to fix after the fact. It definitely ruined a couple picture I really wanted to turn out. I think this is a hazard of this type of camera, not really the TS4 itself.GPS lock-Perfectly clear skies and it had to of taken well over five minutes. My Garmin watch doesn't take that long on cloudy days. Sometimes it would get a fix really quick and scroll the name of the location and country right away. I think this is a con because when I pull a point and shoot out of my camera I want to take a picture and have it work right away with an accurate GPS tag.Panorama Problems-I was in these massive sand dunes in Peru and wanted to take a panorama of the view. I tried at least 10-15 times to take a panorama changing sweep directions and widths and views hoping the camera would capture one. Always got error messages along the lines of go faster or slower or keep levelt. Keep in mind I've been using this camera for awhile at this point and had taken many panoramas. I'm not sure if it was the lack of contrast from sand dune to sand dune but I never got the picture.Underwater warning-It shows up every time. I get it, I read the instructions, I acknowledged them. Now I'll still have to do it every time I turn on the camera.I have used three other brands of tough cameras, Fuji, Pentax and Casio, this one is by far the best in picture quality and features/ease of use. I think you just have to accept the cons if you want this type of camera. I debated giving this four/five stars because five stars really should mean it is perfect. I ended up giving it five stars because this really is the best tough camera you can get right now.", "Date": "June 22, 2012"}, {"Title": "This camera is a piece of garbage.

But there's a heavy cost that comes with this.Rolling shutter.Even with my stabilization software i can't really correct rolling shutter because the original image is distorted in the first place, thus yielding me warped stabilization that looks like an acid trip rather than beautiful aerial imagery.CCD sensors do not have the rolling shutter because the image production process is completely different and the below video is a clear demonstration of the difference.[...]So I set out on a quest to find the best quadcopter camera on a budget.The first thing i did was look for a camera that records 1080hd at 60fps with a CCD sensor.This was the tricky part, most cameras today are made with CMOS sensors... Long story short, CCD sensors don't have rolling shutter at all. Up until now there hasn't been a decently priced/sized camera made with CCD sensor/1080 60fpsI found one that offered 1080p at 30fps with the glorious CCD sensor but not just that...It is orange.It is dustproof.It is shockproof.It has a 24mm leica lens.It is waterproof up to 20 feet.It has a gps built in so it records where it goes.It has a barometer in it so it will also record how high it goes.And the punchline?It costs $265.The below video was shot over the course of 4 days and entirely with this camera. I actually messed up several potentially great flights because I was still experimenting with the different settings.[...]The only flight I had with the below optimized setting was the long shot of the yellow house.My optimized setting- Turn autofocus in video mode off, be sure to focus on one far away object before recording... Set to scene mode, and then click on the sunset present.If using a Mac for the upload, don't format the SD card- simply insert it in the computer and upload via final cut pro/imovie/image browser... if you copied the files over and formatted the card you can still extract the files by showing the package contents of the large avcd file and then you'll find the .mts movie file hidden away in one of the files... I used iVI for the conversion. It's $3.99I only had to convert the files because I forgot to upload directly from the SD rather than copying the files.The other neat features of this camera?Panorama mode. Below is one example I snapped earlier today.Timelaspe mode. Especially good for aerial photography.Support for 64gb SD cards. I used my 64gb Sandisk, it took forever to fill up the card.Now onto the bad news:This doesn't have live out while recording. There is a supplied AV cable but as of right now the screen goes black when recording. This isn't a big deal for most people but for me I would have loved to use it as my FPV camera as well... the canon DSLR line has this ability to do this but unfortunately am supplied with harsh price tags and rolling shutter. So we'll have to wait a little longer for a new camera or a hack.There's a ugly sensor flare when exposed directly into the sunlight. You can see the purple line in the very last shot when the sun comes into the shot. It's because of the CCD sensor and how it handles light. At the time of this writing there isn't really a solution. It's just part of the cost for ultra stabilization but to put things in perspective... I would get about 10 usable seconds on a regular flight on my 5d mark 2 and with this camera I get at least 1 minute of usable footage.Also it claims to have 60i 1080p but I can't find the setting anywhere so if anyone knows about this please notify me but  30fps was good enough to stabilize with the CCD sensor. The original footage looked pretty shaky but since there's no rolling shutter final cut X was able to stabilize everything almost perfectly.Finally a number of people report it not being truly waterproof... I have used it in the water a few times now and had no issues but I would suggest buying a different camera if looking to use underwater on a regular basis.I feel like I've only touched on the iceberg of what's possible with this cheap camera.It can't be a coincidence that this has `quad' in its name.I never thought I'd love a point and shoot.My grade: A-Pros: CCD sensor allow for crisp stabilization, 24mm leica is perfect for action sports, shockproof, gps, barometer, 1080p 30 fps, timelaspe, panorama mode, and the list goes on.Cons: No live out during recording, 60fps is no where to be found, horrible sensor flares when exposed directly at sunlight, and the case might not be that waterproof according to some reviews.", "Date": "August 2, 2012"}, {"Title": "Not waterproof", "Author": "LOVE HDTV \"smc\"", "ReviewID": "RI6RCAG98U9RX", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "Loved this camera at first.

It was nice having a camera handy for landscapes and portraits while the DSLR had my 500 mm lens attached.Don't buy it and expect high zoom ratios.  A fixed front lens element reduces the optical zoom range, but allows it to be water tight down to 40 feet.  The automatic mode seems to make good choices most of the time, although you can sometimes improve the results using the camera's other features.  It makes nice videos and very nice photographs.  I recommend the camera for wet and underwater conditions and as a small rugged handy camera.  Some reviews suggest it leaks, but if you take care to keep the seal area under the battery door clean all the time (not just when you plan to dunk it), the seal should last a long time.", "Date": "September 17, 2012"}, {"Title": "just last 6 weeks", "Author": "Jose Diaz", "ReviewID": "RWR0FNDS7PGRW", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I bought it on July 1st.

As I was standing on the shore line of the Atlantic, it told me I was 15ft above sea level.  Then the number started varying between 15 and 25 feet.  It also took a few pictures for the location information to update on the camera, and the time to update the information varied.Second, it will randomly caution about making sure the door is closed and locked before using the camera.  Doesn't seem like that big of a deal, but with a camera known for being exceptionally fast to pull up and take a picture (think baby's first step type of moments), you then have to Ok a dialog on the camera telling you to make sure the door is locked before taking pictures.However, overall, I am more than pleased with this purchase and would not trade it for anything.", "Date": "February 28, 2013"}, {"Title": "Fantastic Camera but...", "Author": "DiveDoggie", "ReviewID": "RR7M4MMQB9RZZ", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Do not take this camera underwater more than 21 feet.

It's rugged, the picture quality is fantastic, it's relatively lightweight and compact, and the GPS feature is neat for retelling past adventures later on. The anodized aluminum shell is a nice touch, and I chose an orange one; for those times it will inevitably plunge out of my pack and needs to be found. It has a battery life that would make an iphone user's eyes bug out (I've squeezed eight weeks of moderate and infrequent use out of one charge, I would estimate a week of heavy use in the hands of a careful user.)The controls are intuitive and easy to learn, and this thing is more feature-packed than the complete run of MST3K. It's a fantastic, reliable, user-friendly camera. I do, however, have a few reservations.The first is that it can be kind of a nag. I change memory cards frequently, and each time I do, I get a startup message reminding me to make sure I've closed the battery compartment door. Annoying, but no deal-breaker.The bigger issue is the battery. Panasonic's proprietary battery saves on bulk, weight, and has a fantastic battery life, but the only way to charge it is with a wall-charger.As a backpacker, this is a bone-headed decision because I don't have a wall outlet with me on the trail; so if I run out of juice, no more memorable pictures to take home. Compounding this is the fact that the USB cable can't charge it either, so there's no hope in bumming a recharge off a small solar panel or anything. When the power goes out, it's bricked.Ultimately, this is the major fly in the proverbial ointment; that said, the rest of the ointment is fantastic.>>>>>> THE DEAL WITH DIVERS AND THIS CAMERA <<<<<<<<<<<<<<If you're a diver looking for a dive camera, this is a great choice because of its impressive resume, but bear in mind that Panasonic also sells a water-tight case to keep the elements out. While the documentation for the TS4 says it's a fully waterproof camera, it's just not worth the risk; it's like the Chevy Volt, they say it's economical, but omit that it might also burn you to death. If you're a diver, spend a little extra and buy some armor for your tech.For the average buyer reading the negative reviews, you'll see a number of folks that took this camera diving, and it failed in the field. Does this affect my view of the product? Certainly, but it's all relative. If you're just looking for a rugged little camera for campounts and rainy days, look no further.", "Date": "November 7, 2012"}, {"Title": "I abuse this camera", "Author": "Kevin R.

Before I use it I make sure the side doesn't have sand, hair, or anything else. Just pop the side and look. Clean if there is anything. Thats all. After I use it in salt water, I let it sit in the sink with fresh water for a few min, and then refresh the water and let it sit again. The manual says to do this. Its not difficult.

My selection came down to the LUMIX, the Sony, and the Canon waterproof models. The main reason for my new purchase was that 1. I was ready to replace my Canon Elph SD790 from years ago (which served me well) and 2. The family was taking a trip to Dominican Republic. Let's just say I was not disappointed in this camera's performance!I knew we were going to be involved in many adventures and underwater activites so the durability and waterproof features really appealed to me. I was a little hesitant on this camera due to the waterproof reviews I have read on this camera. After reading all I could and not seeing as many positive waterproof reviews as I would have liked (performance and picture quality was always rated high in reviews) I chalked it up to people with product issues post more reviews than people without issues. My TS4 survived swimming with the dolphins, underwater pool pics, swimming in the ocean, ATV journeys, and Damajagua (27 waterfalls) without incident. I was able to hook the strap to my life jacket on the falls tour and it stayed put. I wasn't worried about it detaching. Not only did the pictures and video come out high quality, I had not one issue with water leakage. After each water use, I submerged my camera into fresh water for about 10 mins, allowed to dry, and the seal was perfect.I haven't quite been able to get the hang of selecting the different types of picture (gotta learn the new menus and how to select Snow, action, etc) but I'm sure that will come in time. The menu doesn't seem to be as intuitive as my Canon or as easy to select different picture types.My GPS worked fine but it took me awhile to keep the time correct (it kept flipping the time zone and daylight savings which threw off my time). I chalk this up to user error as I finally figured it out by flipping through the time menu and making the proper selections.Overall, this seems to be a great camera for my needs. I still have to read the instruction manual thoroughly to get maximum results but otherwise, I was happy with it right out of the box and pretty much no instruction.

I am a wetland biologist and wanted a backup for my larger and more expensive camera. Plus, I was intrigued by the time lapse and underwater capability of this camera. I carried this camera in my kayak, while wading in a wide variety of ecosystems, and used it underwater. For a point and shoot this camera is well worth the money! If you take the time to really explore its features it produces amazing results. At the same time, when it is on auto it works great as well. For example, I held the camera out the car window to grab shoots of the Art Deco buildings of Miami and it worked great (good focus and color).The only thing I did to protect it was keep it in a padded case to protect the lens and screen from scrapes and scratches. And that was a good thing. In contrast, a friend of mine took hers on a cruise and kept in her pocket with miscellaneous items and the camera screen is badly scratched. So that seems to be its one weakness. I never expected to find a point and shoot I liked - until I used this one. Lastly, if you plan to use it in water or moisture, the lens will fog if you keep the camera in a setting where the temperature is dramatically different from the one you plan to use it in. For example, don't leave it in the hot car if you plan to use it in cool water because it will fog - store it at the temperature you plan to use it at.

This thing is great! The price kept fluctuating, but I ended up getting it at $100 less than suggested retail. What can I say that hasn't been said? The optional fast autofocus is great. You sacrifice the best focus but you get the shot. Just quickly press the shutter button all the way down and snap! Or for better focus, half press, wait for the reticle to go from red to green, press all the way in. The depth of field or whatever it's called is good when taking close ups. The burst mode is really handy. Just hold the button down and click click click. You can burst about 6 shots in full res, no flash. About ONE HUNDRED shots in Fast Burst mode, 3mp, no flash. That goes CLICKCLICKCLICKCLICK! I have yet to test the flash burst mode. The low light shots are pretty good, not as good as a decent dslr, obviously but they are much better than my previous Panasonic, about 6 years old, 6mp, cheapo but compact and very good for its day. That way really my only complaint about that old one, bad low light shots. The GPS is cool, but some times takes a long time to get a super precise location, so on the shots taken when the location isn't detailed, when you review them it asks if you want to write location data, which just stamps the meta data of the name of the place it thinks you took the pic. Kinda neat, but I use iPhoto so it just drops a pin. I assume this is more meant to work with the included pc program.Also very handy: on the top of the camera there is the power button, still shutter button, and video record button. This means you don't have to switch over to move mode, just push the perfectly recessed and smaller button and you're recording, it does take a second to start recording but having that button just start it makes up enough time to usually catch those moments when they start.The power up time is fairly quick too, but not instant. Acceptable.The battery is also very good. One review said he got about 300 shots on one charge. The time I experimented, I got 489 one day. With a video or two. This was a normal vacation day. So some on / off, some continuous shots. There was only one day when the battery didn't last me all day. Sorry I didn't count how many pictures I took, but I know it was a lot, and many continuous shots. Also I found myself a bit trigger happy at times with that burst mode. I think maybe establishing a good location with GPS then turning it off would help the battery last longer. But I'm always afraid ill forget to turn it back on. But there is a little green led on top to remind you that GPS is on.There is no panoramic mode, which is a bummer. But it has this weird 3D mode which shoots kinda like the pano on my iPhone. I don't think it would produce a 2D pano. Strange decision to choose a funky 3D over any panoramic, in my opinion.The wide angle is great and the zoom is decent enough to capture more detail. There are actually two levels of digital zoom. Be careful not to enable the extended digital zoom. It's crap. But you already knew that. The regular digital zoom gets you from the optical 4.6 to 9.x, the 3rd level goes to 12 or something and just looks like 8-bit Mario.The video quality is great for the price. Choice between mp4 or AVCHD, 1080p/30 or 720p/60 (at least I think it's 60fps) Mono mic is acceptable, but I assumed it wouldn't be IMAX quality since it has to be waterproof. Speaking of that, it worked very well under water. Color was good and in focus too! We took it surfing and snorkeling as well as a peaceful freshwater stream. The buttons started sticking after 2 hours of surfing, at one point no button would work at all, only power. So I followed the instructions and dunked it it fresh water for about twice as long as it recommended. 20~30 minutes later, good as new.I wish it had a focus lock. I went whale watching and it had a hard time with that image of water and cloudy sky. It would eventually go green after a few attempts at the half press.The screen is pretty good. The color of the pictures are MUCH better on my laptop than on the screen, but you're not buying this to keep the photos only on that tiny display.I haven't tested all the others brands or models, but the reviews & since I liked my old Panasonic so much that I had to try this one. It is exactly what I had hoped it old be and more! Altimeter logging!?! Face remembering and tagging. Baby tagging.

The camera did pretty well without any fault when I decided to submerge it into the ocean. I followed all the instructions before and after submerging in water, everything worked out fine and dandy. It took a bit of time to learn all the functions and presets of the camera but it wasn't too tricky.I especially like the panoramic capability and I LOVE the 1 sec shutter speed adjustment. It's rather nice for a relatively inexpensive outdoor camera.PROS:  -Definitely built for rough terrain. I strapped this to my arm during an extensive, rainy hike up the Na Pali coast and ended with this camera being fairly unscathed; just a couple of dents and scratches when I accidentally brushed it against rocks and other such hard surfaces. The structure of the camera is really solid, but the rubber that surrounds the housing for the battery and SD card will need to be replaced each year to ensure that the camera remains waterproof.  -Custom Settings for shutter speed is a huge win for me. I love taking night time shots, and this will definitely help in my endeavors. The automatic nighttime mode is pretty nice too, I haven't really taken too many pictures with this mode but what I experimented with was pretty good quality. I haven't tried to shoot stars/starry night yet. I'm not sure how it'll look. The night pictures I have taken, with low light source or relying only on the camera's flash and support flash, have very little noise. I love that.  -12 megapixel is pretty decent for a point and shoot. The picture quality is rather good and can be adjusted if you have programs like photoshop to adjust your good/great picture to something really amazing.  -The panoramic capability is really nice, it may take some getting used to because of the speed in which you capture each frame can determine whether or not you get a 90 -> 180 -> almost 360 view of your surroundings.  -Battery Life is really great. I could cart my camera around for multiple days without having to recharge or replace my battery.CONS:  -With the minimal amount of experimenting with video, the image quality is pretty good but the sound could use just a bit more strength. I'm not sure if you can adjust this somewhere else in the camera, maybe you can, I haven't experimented too much with video.  -Not really a con, but it's safe to note that all cameras need a clear lens to take clear pictures. This camera is no exception. This is more a mistake on my part but I had wondered why my pictures came out with a halo/glowing effect and as it turns out, some material had smudged itself on my lens making my pictures interestingly hazy.I would recommend this camera to anyone.

Sometimes every few minutes (when in photo mode), sometimes every few seconds.  The 'flashing' also resets the camera to ready to shoot mode, and happens almost instantly any time a menu is entered, meaning I can't even get in to do a reset of the camera to see if that helps.  My best guess, and this is a guess, is that one of the buttons is being automatically pushed and causes the camera to drop everything and go back to the main screen.I've searched for the possibility of doing a hard reset, but haven't found anything so far.Camera has not been dropped, frozen or used in water (which is too bad, because kayaking was the long term plan for it).Edit - 05/16/13I eventually got the camera stable enough to dig and find the reset option.  This did nothing.  Still thinking it might be a button, I disassembled the entire thing (FYI two of the front screws are fake and never come out).  I didn't see any notable damage to the PCBs, ribbon cables or internal connectors.  I eventually noticed that the video out connector had some corrosion.  Scrubbed that out with a stiff brush and some pure alcohol (not the common 30% water variety), and voila, camera works like normal.  I went back with a tiny scalpel and made sure to clean up the pins well.  Camera has worked fine since.  I'm thinking that a drop of water got into the connector port causing the corrosion.  The camera then saw some signal between pins and kept switching over to external video mode - which correlates with the 16:9 or 4:3 messages I would see flashed on the screen.I'm confident enough that this was the complete problem and that it is fully fixed that that I gave it back to my girlfriend (it was hers) and bought a second one for myself.I'll give it four stars now, because I suspect that it could have been designed to not have voltage on those pins when they are not in use, which is what made it susceptible to the corrosion, but also, I believe I did get water on the connector, which is completely my fault.  Also, if video out were a manual setting, the corrosion would still exist, but since I never used video out, it never would have caused a functional issue with the camera.", "Date": "March 9, 2013"}, {"Title": "Rugged camera from Panasonic", "Author": "R.

So far I haven't been disappointed. I have taken it on a whitewater rafting trip where it was repeatedly splashed with water and banged against a paddle as I rowed. I took it on a jet boat trip where again it was splashed repeatedly. I took it on a sandrail ride through the Oregon Dunes where it was blasted with fine sand for about an hour. I've dropped it onto a gravel/dirt beach from a height of about 4 feet and also onto a grass lawn from about 2 feet and it still performed fine after all of that.It has a slew of modes that I haven't had the time or opportunity to completely explore but the few I have used have worked well. The panorama mode is kinda cool to play with and the Sunset mode can be a nice improvement on mother nature at times. Most of the controls and modes are easy to figure out but there are some that I will begrudgingly have to look up in the owner's manual because \"miniature effect\" is just not obvious to me. And the difference between Baby1 and Baby2 is not immediately clear as the electronic definition that pops up on the LCD when you select a mode is the same.My only two complaints so far have to do with the battery. First, if you use the GPS and/or Quad indicators in the camera, it drains the battery quickly because both features drain power even when the camera is off, so have one or two spares on hand. My other suggestion is to only turn on those features when necessary and then turn them off.The other battery problem I have had is trying to get the battery out of the battery compartment.

However, I felt that given my intended uses, this camera would be suitable. I have a old pentax optio W30 that is only waterproof to 10 feet and it is still working despite years of use. The reason for this is that I haven't really forced the underwater features. Mostly I use a camera for outdoor pursuits, primarily hiking and kayaking. I don't want to worry about rain or the camera getting splashed with water. Occasionally I take a few underwater shots when there is a good opportunity (like my trout picture) but I don't feel the need to take this diving...I have been a research diver for a long time and have learned that you have to use equipment that is intended for diving (housings and flash equipment).What I like about this camera is that the image quality is good for a point and shoot (a huge improvement over my pentax) and it has all the newest features like GPS and various image settings. I have found the panoramic, high sensitivity, and handheld night setting functions to be most useful. It is worth reading the manual but the menus are pretty intuitive and explanatory. Video seems pretty good, as well as battery life. I wish that there was a way to charge the battery while inside the camera to avoid carrying around the wall outlet charger. This is one drawback.

It fits in your pocket, is waterproof to any depth most of us will take it (40 feet), and you can drop it once or twice before it breaks.It also has the usual geegaws of recent cameras. GPS, good video, the usual. This little guy even has an altimeter and a barometer. (Altimeter I get. Barometer, not at all.) Of all these many features, apart from waterproofing, the standouts are the optical zoom and the automatic panorama. An optical zoom, as you probably know, is vastly better than what is sometimes called a \"digital zoom.\" Digital zoom is not a zoom at all, it's just making a part of the image bigger. A true optical zoom uses sophisticated glass to extend the focal length of the camera, without losing any resolution. It's pretty amazing that this little Lumix has a 4.6x optical zoom within its waterproof housing. Phenomenal, really.The instant panorama is a more common feature on cameras these days. The Lumix's just works really well.Downsides? The camera requires Panasonic's crumby and confusing proprietary software to get videos off a card. The software takes a long time to install, and doesn't appear available on their website. So save that disc! And woe betide you if you have a fancy laptop without a disc drive.But the inconvenience of this sub-par software is far outshined by the pretty remarkable performance of this take-anywhere little gem.

Price quote for repair (or perhaps exchange) this date $172.75 plus $7.50 return shipping for a total $180.25 plus shipping to repair facility in TX. Since repair was more than half of replacement cost am electing to dispose of and purchase Panasonic Marine Camera case for other DMC-ZS3 model I own for $240.

Eventually something breaks, I drive over or drop one, get moisture inside, or some other nonsense.  I take tons of pictures, while camping, hiking, ATVing, snowmobiling, boating, white water rafting, kayaking, and more.  My last camera, Panasonic Lumix DMC-ZS8, got sand inside the lense the first time I stepped onto a beach with it, and that's when I decided to get something ruggedized.  The best I found was this TS4.  My only hesitation was the short optical zoom.  My last camera had a 16x optical zoom, and I loved it until I discovered that the long zoom also created the problem of pulling dirt inside the camera when the lens was extended and retracted.  This camera has a \"folding lense\" which means it's contained inside the camera body, and there is nothing to extend or retract.  I wasn't filled with confidence, between the folding lens and the short zoom, but I've since found that it's just fine.  Yes, it's nice to have a 16x optical zoom, but I like the ruggedness and reliability of this TS4.  It's supposed to be waterproof, but I'm not going to mess with that.  I'm just happy that I can take it to the beach, the Dunes, in the rain, inside my back pocket when I'm working in the garden, and I know that it can handle any conditions I subject it to.

All the while, I've searched Best Buy, regional camera stores, etc. Everyone was waiting for it -- but it was not yet out. Early this week, Amazon indicated that it was available through J & R camera in NYC. I ordered the camera (matte black) at a premium price ($399) and it arrived yesterday. While it's only been a day, it is clear that this is the durable, waterproof, intuitive, lightweight and high quality camera that I had anticipated. In its simplicity, the camera has flair and feels comfortable in the hand; optimal from my standpoint. Obviously, it is waterproof and very shock absorbent. The internal gaskets appear pliable and soft. There are good instructions re. removing grains of sand, etc. in order to ensure the integrity of water and dustproofing, with a small double brush provided for this purpose. I liked the recommendation to soak the camera in water after salt water and beach exposure -- not used to that for my camera equipment. The geo features are wonderful. I'm using a 32G memory card and the video resolution is incredible. Importantly, the close ups are extremely high res without a barrel protruding in front of the camera. This will replace my Canon SLR when on back country trips and overseas.

With that, I really don't think my expectations are too high.  I started with some quick shots right out of the box, in auto mode.  All were terrible.  Most came out blurry.  The ones which didn't, were very soft in the corners, and some were totally soft throughout.  I tried during daylight (outside) and indoors.  All very poor quality.  Now, I heard that the waterproof cameras are not at good, but the quality matched my 2.0MP phone camera.  This is not acceptable for a $300 camera.  So, since a camera is made to take pictures, this one fails at the most basic function. I see that many people I leaving great reviews about the picture quality, so I am not sure what the issue was.Now, some more details.  Out the box, the camera feels good in the hand.  It does feel solid and well built.  There are non-slip pieces all abound, and the hand grip feels right as well.  Controls are pretty standard and comparable to most other cameras on the market.  The menu is very intuitive, and most semi-tech-savvy people should figure it out quickly.  The camera has many \"cool\" options (time-lapse, 3D, etc.).  Now, I did not try them out since the pictures were awful in the standard modes, I just could not justify keeping the camera for a 3D mode when it cannot take a basic picture.Now the software.  Once again, I am not a professional, but this should not be as complicated as it was.  Basically, Panasonic wants you to use only their software to transfer your pic to the computer.  I figured a way around it (coping without the software), but it's not very intuitive (the Canon software was much more user friendly).Lastly, the water performance.  So, I did not trust the other reviews which stated that the camera leaks even when the instructions are followed.  Well, it does.  I made sure that the seals were clean (dust, sand, hair, etc.), yet no luck.  My leak was very small (couple drops), yet I can imagine that with longer underwater use this can become a serious problem.  I'm not an engineer, but it seems that a simple design change to the very small seal should fix all the problems the people are having, but maybe saving 15 cents on a better seal is worth all the bad comments.Ok, so in summary:PROS:  Appears well built.

Not a matter of 'if' or taking care of the seal.  I did those things and it doesn't matter.  If you spend any length of time in the water at all (more than 15-30 minutes) chances are it will leak and when it does, Panasonic will void your warranty. Period.  I snorkeled for about 2 hours and thankfully it held up... well, until I went to rinse the salt water off per the instructions that is.  That's when it finally leaked.  i never opened the battery door and it was locked the whole time.  Thankfully, it was the fresh water than got in, so when it dried fully, it worked again.  Salt water kills it instantly and permanently.If you plan on snorkeling for more than 15 or 30 minutes, buy the marine housing.

We returned back to the US on 3/21 and I called Panasonic the next morning. I had told him that the camera was purchased on Amazon on 3/17/13 and shipped on 3/21/13. I was told that my year warranty would still be in effect because they would use the 3/21/13 as my day and it was the next morning.  I sent off my email explaining the problem and was pleasantly surprised.2 days later I get a call from Panasonic saying that I am over a week past my warranty and if I send the camera out to their service center, they would take a look at it and let me know the cost for repairs.  When I started to question the dates he had and explained that we were out of the country, he actually started yelling at me and told me that I should have called the first day it broke or not taken it into the water in the first place.We were always very careful with this camera.  We used it as an underwater camera, but cared for it according to the instructions.  We inspected the seals, soaked it in fresh water after every dive, dried it thoroughly.  We actually considered buying a second Lumix to take with us; SO glad we didn't.UPDATE 5/6/14After filing a complaint with the BBB, we received a call from a customer service supervisor apologizing for everything and instructing me to send the camera back to them in her attention. I did that 3 weeks ago yesterday. Today, without a word from them, I received in the mail a brand new, newer version of the camera, the TS5.

It's even been dropped a few times and we have yet to have any problems with it.

I'm not a photographer in any way. I bought this camera because I was going on vacation and my very old point and shoot died. I actually had no knowledge of the \"tough camera\" genre, but came across one by accident and did some investigating. This one looked to be the best in my price range and so I bought one. (I was actually rather disappointed because a similar camera was on Groupon the next week for $50 less than I paid).Anyway, I was a bit nervous because I read all the reviews claiming that the camera isn't really waterproof, that even though \"unlike everyone else, I followed the directions and it still broke the first time I put it in water.\" Well, nothing to be worried about on that front for me.Because of my paranoia, I carefully read and re-read all the directions about care. Every time I open the battery compartment, even if I don't take the camera into water, I carefully brush off every surface, even if it appears spotless. I always make sure to follow the cleaning directions for my camera if it gets wet, even if it's rainwater or freshwater. I make sure that I don't jostle the camera too much underwater as per the instructions. I make sure not leave it underwater for more than one hour at a time.I've dropped this camera (only purposefully so far) and it still works.I've gone swimming with this camera and it still works.The GPS feature is really neat for remembering where each picture was taken (especially the landmark feature, that's pretty neat).It takes better pictures than my last point and shoot, but that's a given since that camera is at least 6 years old.If you camera was broken out of the box, maybe something happened in transit or you're just especially unlucky. If it breaks after a few trips in the water, well, maybe you weren't caring for it properly. There are surprisingly many places where a bit of dust and get stuck and allow moisture in.

Very easy to hit the on-off button or the movie record button instead of the shutter button, but I've already gotten better at that.  GPS is reliable so far, but does use battery up fairly quickly. Our normal beach time is about 3 hours, and if I leave the GPS on, the battery is down to 1 bar by the end of the trip.  Turn the GPS off and I am down to 2 bars.

If we are out in the field all day taking lots of pictures and keeping the unit on, then it might run out of battery.  Being a little cautious, it lasts all day. - The GPS is generally easy to use. - Lots of different modes for taking pictures.  Does very well at taking panoramas - Picture quality is very good. - High resolution, but it has the presets to take lower resolution photos.  A 14 Megapixel photo is nice and all, but the file sizes are too large. - Ability to record landmarks for the GPS - Internal Compass records the direction of the shot - very important for what I'm doing.Things I don't like: - Haven't been able to get the silly watertight reminder to stop popping up.  Every single time I turn on the camera the notification comes up. - The GPS is just OK.  About half of the time the camera records the GPS location with a few feet.  However, there are other times when it records the photo 50'+ off.  I use GeoSetter (freeware) to adjust the locations after the fact.  Great program. - The GPS has a tendancy to stay at the same location.  If I turn on the camera, take a photo and then walk 100', it will record both pictures at the same location. - There is no way to download the GPS coordinates from the landmarks.

Would recommend this camera.NOTE:  If using camera for underwater, we found it wise to invest in the \"chum strap\" so it will not sink.  More time checking out the fish as we snorkeled and less time worrying about the camera.The camera is very user friendly and easy to switch camera modes (intelligent auto, underwater, beach/snorkeling, etc).  The video is simple touch and takes great movies.  My 10 year old son loves to take the camera in the water and take goofy pool pics and uses the video for professional events he attends (soccer games, Monster Jam, baseball games, etc).  It's a sturdy camera so I feel comfortable allowing my son to think it's his personal camera at events.Reasons for only 4 stars:Cons:  When the temperature changed as we swam under the waterfall, the lens was blurry.  The fogginess was the reason some pics did not turn out.  After a few moments, the blurriness went away and the camera was back to functioning.  However, we missed some great pics/video under the waterfall due to this issue.Lens cover:  No cover which could result in scratching of the lens.  Not sure why there wasn't a function on the camera where you power up the camera and the lens cover automatically opens.Recommendation:  It might be a good investment to purchase a larger memory card.

The conditions this year were terrible with high winds and a good deal of waves plus the water being all dirty and stirred up, blowing sand and so forth. I used the camera extensively in these conditions and even 'tested it' by accidentally dropping it several times onto sand or hard packed earth. At one point, I waded out to snap the swimmers, but got knocked off my feet by a big wave and dropped the camera into the surf. It got banged around a bit until I picked it back up. I figure it got waved tumbled 3 or 4 times onto the loose coral type sand Key West sports. The camera took it all in stride.Given this is a P&S; JPEG only camera, I didn't expect the quality of the output to equal, say, my Canon 5D2 or my friend's Hassie H3 - let's get real here, but for what it is, it worked very well. The pictures are generally high quality with acceptable noise and except for the usual cropping need due to the LCD area not being what the lens captures, don't really need any post processing. Color balance was better than average for this class of camera too with a bit of a bias toward the warm side.The downsides are for me, the flash. This has one eager flash ready to go off when I don't think it's needed and when it does, all too often it creates hot spots ruining the photo. I found the camera's performance all right in normal indoor lighting without the flash so I turned it off entirely and never missed it. I wish there was a setting to lower the flash's output to use as fill lighting but then again, we're getting into DSLR territory for that feature. Another downside, which is universal in this category, is lack of RAW output. Yeah, I know - few wish this but it'd mean we could get so much more out of the camera through post processing. I just cannot give a five star rating to a JPEG only camera.On the up side, the menu system is the best I've ever seen - well laid out and easy to understand even for my wife who is a militant against complex cameras. She used the camera happily (the first one she has ever been happy with) and got some really terrific HD movies and stills in the Butterfly Museum at macro distances.Overall, I'm happy but sure would like a RAW option.", "Date": "July 3, 2012"}, {"Title": "Not an improvement over the TS1", "Author": "Tuukka Toivonen \"tuukka\"", "ReviewID": "R1R9B3IE8RG5TM", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "I bought this to replace a twice-drowned TS1 (which still works, but I'm not taking it underwater again!) that I've been extremely pleased with.The good news is the zoom is actually useful on the TS4 -- the aperture is very small, so you need a lot of light, but if you have it, the images are much sharper than on the TS1 where the zoom was so soft as to be almost useless. Unfortunately, the TS4 apparently traded off so much of its wide angle performance that wide angle on the TS4 is now entirely useless.  Some reviews say the \"edges are blurred\" but really only about the center 50% of the frame is ever in focus at the widest setting.  I find I shoot 95%+ of my compact shots at the widest possible angle so this is just unacceptable.I haven't had a camera with GPS before so I don't really know how they're supposed to work, but having used GPS navigators, the GPS on the TS4 seems like a shoddy afterthought. It does not maintain its location while you move but only checks every few minutes, and if it fails, it waits another few minutes to try again!  This generally means that your images get tagged with where you were perhaps five minutes ago, or if the camera hasn't had a fix yet, where you were yesterday. This is bizarre, since the GPS is actually fairly sensitive, and if you go into the menu and tell the camera to reposition, it often manages it in a few seconds if the sky is clear.  You can set \"landmarks\" in the GPS database but the camera can't help you navigate to them, and the text entry interface is beyond ridiculous (like texting on a number-pad-only phone, except you have to use the arrow keys to move between the buttons, and you can't enter two consecutive characters from the same button even if you wait because it does not time out ever).The TS4 differs from others in its class by having manual aperture and exposure settings, but it turns out it only actually has two apertures: f/3.3 and f/10 at the widest setting, becoming f/5.9 and f/18 at the telephoto end of the zoom, which seriously reduces the usefulness of this mode for photography.Since my ancient twice-drowned TS1 still takes better pictures than the TS4, I sent the TS4 back for a refund (thank you Amazon!) and bought the far-cheaper TS20 instead.  The sensor's a lot worse on that one (16MP, WHY?), and the lens lacks contrast but is at least in focus throughout the frame at wide angle (and 25mm equivalent is nice and wide!) and at the price I can overlook a lot more flaws.  It's also smaller and lighter and is now my river camera, and I'll carry the DSLR on land a lot more now.I wish some camera manufacturer would make a waterproof camera with a 28mm f/2.0 prime lens and a nice big 6MP sensor.  That's all I ever want on a pocket camera.", "Date": "June 20, 2012"}, {"Title": "Outstanding Little Camera", "Author": "MattyJ", "ReviewID": "R3O5L0K08WWO08", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I purchased this camera to replace an older, non-ruggedized Panasonic Lumix point and shoot. I'm klutzy, I drop cameras. Plus I wanted to get something more modern with a GPS in it, and waterproof as a little bonus.After orienting myself to the camera for a couple weeks it was off to Cuba where I took about 1300 photos. The short review is that I had to toss out maybe 10 photos for being out of focus, but this was mostly because I took a lot of pictures out the bus window and didn't always remember to have 'through glass' mode turned on. If I have one complaint, and it's a common one for pocket cameras, is that in low light conditions it doesn't always choose the right mode or focus on the right thing. Most of the stuff I want to take pictures of is outdoors so I don't have a need to take a lot of indoor pictures, in low light, in large open areas.Most common used modes:Through glass - About a third of my pictures were taken through the bus window. If you don't hold the camera close enough to the glass you tend to get reflections, but beyond that it's difficult to tell the pictures were taken while moving. Focus and color are brilliant.Panorama - I never got sick of this novelty. It's more fun than you think.Underwater - No leakage problems. I followed the instructions, unlike some folks on other reviews of this camera. You soak it for 10 minutes or LESS. And let it dry upright. I was in the water for about an hour and had no problems whatsoever. READ THAT MANUAL!Intelligent Auto - Impressive. The auto scene selection on this model is better than the last one I had. Much, much better. It focuses faster. It flashes when it's supposed to flash. It chooses macro mode when it should. This is as close to an idiot-proof camera as I have ever seen.What about battery life? I packed three batteries and kept them charged every day. For a nine day trip, I only used a second battery one time. This may sound like bad battery life but note that I had the LCD on all the time, and GPS was never turned off. Plus I was using an Eye-Fi card which has a wifi antenna built into it. Consider that throughout the day, taking an average of 140 pictures a day, that I was constantly turning it on and off, too. I thought this was pretty good battery life considering all the strain I was putting on it. I barely get a day out of a full charge on my phone, and I don't even use it! :)Overall I'm thrilled with this camera. It's a camera a traveler can toss in a backpack and not worry about being rough with it. You point it at stuff, press the button, and it takes great pictures. No muss, no fuss, though there are plenty of settings and modes you can muss with if you want. For my purposes, for capturing life as it happens without worry, I'm glad I chose this camera.I uploaded some pictures to this review.

'sob'.I started with this camera 2 1/2 years ago. I was able to get one trip out of it and felt like I found THE camera, then I took a second trip. First, the display started flashing on and off in the water. I figured the battery wasn't charged so charge that to capacity. Went back out to video my adventures, it started flashing again. I am in day 3 of a 7 day vacation. I pointed and shot anyway, thinking if it is just the display, it may still be recording to the card. (I am an IT person and that just made sense to me.) alas it took stills! I got the camera home and it worked fine. HMMMMI took it out to take some nature shots on land, the display again not showing anything and now taking stills wasn't even working. Called the company that sold it to me, they said it was still under warranty and I received a new camera to replace the other one. Joy in the household. Went to another snorkeling paradise, worked fine. Again, I am following the instructions to the letter to take care of this little gem. I noticed a little condensation as that trip was winding down and took it home and put it to bed with a bunch of those silica pouches in hopes of drying out the insides.Fast forward to today and the camera won't take video, and is all full of condensation, AGAIN.

I will be going home and destroying this camera and will most likely buy a camera that \"Squid\" in St. Thomas Adventures is using and it ain't a Panasonic.Realizing I am the common denominator with two failing cameras hasn't been lost on me, however I haven't had this problem with any other camera I have owned.

Also it seemed that Olympus(s) newer tough cameras were getting poor reviews.I figured that getting a tough camera would result in less quality photos... after all the lens doesnt protrude off the camera and it only had a f stop of 3.3 (still better than the average kit lens on an slr! but still it wasnt 1.8 like other non tough cameras..)

I bought one in February. And I returned it at the beginning of March.The camera performs very poorly in anything other than full sunlight. Giant -- and I mean GIANT -- artifacts or large smeared areas appear in shots taken in any other conditions. One shot taken two full hours before sunset has what appears to be a pixelated version of the Batplane hovering over the northern horizon. Another shot of a stand of trees taken at the same time has a large area that looks like a watercolor painted by a blind person.The camera also has an uncanny ability to pick up glare that is invisible to the human eye. I had read of this issue in a couple of reviews but assumed that some form of operator error must have been involved. No so. This camera has magical powers, and not the good kind. If you are shooting something that is in a stream or pond or behind glass, there's a good chance you're going to get a surprise.Even in decent light, the camera struggled to find focus. Roughly one in five of my portrait shots were badly out of focus.To my eye, the camera's images were also flat and lacked saturation.The quality of the video was adequate.After resuming my research, I am beginning to suspect that none of the waterproof point-and-shoots currently on the market will produce still images that equal those of non-waterproof point-and-shoots that sold for $100 five years ago.

The camera was very well taken care of, was in excellent condition, and had only been used near water three times when the screen went blank and it stopped working.  It's an expensive camera so I had been very careful to follow Panasonic's instructions each time I'd used it in water: always at the surface and only after all the seals had been checked and cleaned.  Unfortunately, the camera was beyond its 12 month warranty when it stopped working and so Panasonic charged a whopping $180 to fix it.Beyond my disappointment with the product itself, I was surprised to have the rep from Panasonic's McAllen Repair Center tell me that the camera was broken because of improper care despite the fact that a.) they hadn't looked at the camera yet because they don't inspect products they receive until you pay the $180 flat fee to fix it, and b.) anyone who actually examined the camera would have clearly seen it was in excellent condition.  On this point, I fail to understand how Panasonic can justify charging a flat $180 fee before it will even look at a product to determine what is wrong with it or what type of repairs or parts are needed to fix it.  This means that even if all it takes to repair a camera is a $15 replacement LCD screen or a $3 rubber seal, you still pay $180.  Even more frustrating is the fact that no additional warranty is provided once the camera is repaired, so it's entirely possible you could pay to fix the camera only to have it break again in a month.All-in-all an extremely discouraging experience that makes me wary of any Lumix camera.", "Date": "March 30, 2012"}, {"Title": "Mistake", "Author": "KapenaKeoni", "ReviewID": "RJ4I4E19H3TE1", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I bought this camera.
