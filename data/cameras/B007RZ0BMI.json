{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Okay camera", "Author": "RetiredProf", "ReviewID": "R1VQ6CT4DZ15CM", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I was introduced to this line of cameras when a friend was using a S3300. I was impressed with the 30X zoom and the apparent quality of the photos he was taking. By the time I got around to looking into a purchase, the S4500 was available for less money. It seems to be about the same hardware. I like the idea of using rechargeable NiMH batteries and was willing to accept a larger body to accommodate them. Once I started using the camera however, I was disappointed in the quality of the images and video I was getting. I have a feeling I will have to mess with the manual settings to get things just right, as a few other reviews have stated. Other than that, which is a big deal in itself, the features of the camera are impressive. I am not sure it was worth giving up the small form of the point and shoot that it replaced, other than the 30X zoom. The extras that came with it made it a great deal. I would recommend this camera to anyone looking for a 30X zoom and willing to put up with the larger size and the need to adjust the settings to get a good shot.", "Date": "November 17, 2012"}, {"Title": "Great beginner camera", "Author": "MikeD", "ReviewID": "R1UTNXX0NGO6GE", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I love the zoom on this. I have taken a ton of great pictures with this camera. I'm very much a beginner but I think this camera has a great price to performance ratio. I'm in Afghanistan on deployment and on convoys I will take pictures of things. We can be moving and the pictures turn out great. I don't like the 1.5sec delay in between shots.", "Date": "February 6, 2013"}, {"Title": "nice...", "Author": "BLT", "ReviewID": "R3T2EJQFG3UL9P", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Camera should come with a manual, not a cd with instructions.

Great guidance menu and plenty of options no need for additional lenses and at the price your not going to leave it at home you will take it with you willingly not worrying about taking a $500 plus camera on ventures my wife loves to take photos and her other camera is a lumix g3c and it takes amazing pics but for the days out on the road (motorcycle rides) the s4500 will be the one!
