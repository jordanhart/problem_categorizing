Obviously a security item costing $30 is going to be $30s worth of protection. Biggest complaint is that the triggering distance is not as advertised. Have to get way closer than it says. Works when it gets tripped and would at least startle someone. Strobe would be affective at night. I will use it till I find something better.", "Date": "September 26, 2012"}, {"Title": "Strobe Security System", "Author": "R.

I am not sure how long the batteries last, but I will try to update that information later.IR Remote Motion Alarm and Door ChimeGeneralAt Alarm mode, the Motion sensor detects any intruder entering its range and responds with a series of blinding strobe flashes and an ear-piercing 120 dB siren. This completely wireless, battery-powered alarm is easy to install and operate. For Door Chime operation; the Alarm is disarmed and you simply press & hold the remote 3 button for 3 seconds. It will sound 'Ding Dong' once to enter into Door Chime mode. The Door Chime is activated once when it detects any motion within its range. Press and hold the remote button for 3 seconds to go back to Alarm mode and the strobe light will flash twice. In addition, it can be powered with an optional 9v DC 500mA adapter (not included). The Motion Alarm is built with a Passive Infrared (PIR) sensor to detect motion within a 110-120 degree angle and a 25-30 ft. radius. The infrared (IR) remote controls can arm or disarm the alarm with the single push of a button and the strobe light will flash once. It is similar to a TV or VCR remote; just point the remote at the Motion Alarm to operate it. The Motion Alarm unit can be mounted wherever it is needed for maximum coverage. A fully adjustable wall mount bracket is included.Set Custom CodesUnscrew the battery door on the backside of the Motion Alarm. There is a 4-digit Dip switches on the bottom of the battery compartment  for the IR Sensor codes. Set your custom codes for the IR Sensor. Unscrew the back case of the IR remote unit. Program the 4-digit Dip switch with the same codes as the Motion Alarm.Battery InstallationRemove the battery cover and install one 9v alkaline and four AA alkaline batteries (not included) with the correct polarity as shown. Two 'low battery' LED indictors are located on the front of unit. When either of these LED indicators is lit, the corresponding battery should be replaced. The Motion Alarm can also be operated with a 9v DC 500 mA adapter (not included). The remote control requires one 12v alkaline battery (included). Replace the 12v battery when IR reception range is reduced significantly.Mounting Bracket Installation* Attach the mount arm to the wall mount plate and secure by dipping the U-shaped plastic clip around the large knob protruding through the back of the wall plate.* Select a location on the wall for maximum coverage of the desired surveillance area. Fasten assembled mounting bracket to wall with the screws.* Holding the Motion Alarm unit in one hand, align the screw hole on the bottom of the unit to the screw end of the mounting joint.* Turn the Motion Alarm unit clockwise until it is securely in place. Move the Motion Alarm left and right until the desired position is determined. Tighten the set screw by hand.* Then, using the separate set screw provided, attach the mounting joint to the mount arm. Before tightening the set screw, adjust the up and down position.* After adjustment of the set screws by hand, installation is now complete. Additional adjustments can be made at any time by using two set screws.OperationTo activate the Motion Alarm unit, simply point the remote control towards the alarm unit and press the button once. The strobe light also flashes once. At this time, the Exit Delay LED will flash, signaling a 12-18 seconds interval for you to exit the surveillance area before the alarm is armed. After alarm is armed, any motion within the surveillance area will set off the Motion Alarm. Once the alarm has been triggered, the Entry Delay LED will be lit, signaling 10-15 seconds delay time before the 120 dB siren sounds and the strobe light flashes. This Entry Delay provides you time to deactivate the alarm by pressing the IR remote control once. The Motion Alarm cycle is around 35 seconds, and it rearms itself if no motion is detected. To switch Alarm (disarmed) to Door Chime mode, simply press and hold the remote button for 3 seconds. You will hear 'Ding Dong' once to switch alarm to Door Chime mode. When the motion sensor detects any motion, it will sound 'Ding Dong' once. To exit the Door Chime mode, press and hold the remote button for 3 seconds. The strobe light will flash twice.Emergency LightThe Motion Alarm features an Emergency Light option for use during power failures or other emergency situations. A switch is located on the upper left side of the alarm unit. With alarm deactivated, switch to the 'on' position and the strobe light provides illumination. Switch to 'off' to turn light off.WarrantyProvide full warranty for one year from the date of purchase due to defects in workmanship and materials.

I was happy with the alarm. It worked great. For $35 it's worth every cent (I used it in an outdoor shed). Ordered a new one from UniquExceptional and recieved a cheaper version that didn't work.  There's a reason their version is $10 cheaper from this company.

We insatlled two of these in our garage right beside the two inside doors. I can pull in the garage without setting them off. I like this product because it is loud enough to scare away would be burglars but not loud enough for any neighbors to be disturbed by it. I like the fact that you can adjust the angle so it doesn't go off when i pull in the garage but if someone tried to get in either door it will go off. i would recommend it to everyone who wants to feel safe inside their home & when you have to leave your home. Thank you. Again excellent product.", "Date": "January 18, 2013"}, {"Title": "Works OK.", "Author": "R.
