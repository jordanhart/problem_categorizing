Had mine set up on my wireless network in minutes. Much better video quality than I expected for this price.Definitely meant to be used indoors in low light. When I point it out the window, the image just washes out and goes all white. But indoors, with normal lighting, the image is great. Night time image is very good. The built-in IR LEDs work well to about 20ft or so. Beyond that, things are pretty dark. I tried an experiment and turned on a desk lamp with a very low power fluorescent bulb and the camera had enough light to see everything in the house in full color. Really good low light performance.The microphone is also very sensitive. Almost too sensitive. It picks up every sound in the house. I can hear the ceiling fan, air conditioner, TV in another room, people talking in other rooms etc. Has 2-way audio but haven't tried it yet. UPDATE- two way audio works great. You need a powered, amplified speaker; I used an old computer speaker.Super easy to operate. You don't need any special software to remotely view, just Internet Explorer. You can view with Firefox, but you lose some features. When viewing remotely over the Internet, you can click on any point in the image and the camera centers itself on that point.Tons more options and features but, you can read about them on the manufacturers website.If this had a true optical zoom, it would be just about perfect but, full Pan Tilt and Zoom cameras cost a lot more than this one.I am pleasantly surprised with this camera. I've tried several 'affordable' cameras over the past few years and have been quite disappointed with them. The only really good network PTZ I've found is a nine hundred dollar Panasonic. Too expensive for me and it does not have audio.If you need audio and full range pan ant tilt, but don't need zoom, this is probably your best choice right now for any price. Panasonic makes a nice, small, wireless camera with audio and pan and tilt but it does not have the range of motion that this camera has and this camera has much better low light image quality.REVIEW UPDATE- I've had mine now for several months and it still works great. I changed the video setting to \"outdoor\" and now it works perfectly in full sunlight. And it still works just as good in full dark as it did with the other video settings. I was having some problems with the camera losing it's wireless connection to my Linksys router. I would have to power cycle the camera to get it to reconnect. But then I started having other problems with the Linksys router so I replaced my old Linksys router with a newer D-Link router and the problems have gone away. The camera has not lost it's connection since I replaced the router.Because this camera is IR sensitive and does not have a switchable mechanical IR filter, daylight images sometimes look a little fuzzy, as if the lens is dirty. This is most noticeable when viewing indoors with a lot of sunlight coming in through the windows. I have other IR sensitive cameras and they exhibit the same behavior.Overall, I am still quite pleased with this camera and just wish Amazon would make it a Gold Box deal so I could get another one!Amazon recently put the Panasonic BLC131A wireless network camera on sale for about 1/2 price so I got one to try. The Trendnet TV-IP422W is far superior to the Panasonic; it has much better image quality, sound quality and range of motion, and the Trendnet configuration screens seem much more intuitive to me.If Trendnet would add a zoom lens and a mechanical IR filter, this camera would be perfect.", "Date": "June 7, 2008"}, {"Title": "DON''T rely on Wireless Functionality", "Author": "Richard Lau \"Gadget Geek\"", "ReviewID": "RLAWC8KAL32J5", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Hopefully you will find this review helpful for your setup.  I know I rely HEAVILY on reviews and feedbacks for my purchase.First off, don't expect much from the wireless feature.  It's nice to have, for portability e.g. but not for reliability nor stability.I bought 4 of these cameras, mounted them all wirelessly with (a) front door, (b) back door (c) kitchen and (d) foyer, to keep an eye on our dog.  I figured I may be able to skip on pet hotel fees and get a big peace of mind at the same time.  I setup my routers, sort out the remote web access and even got them to work via my iphone using the $5 eyecam app.  The $25 IP PRO View app does not work with the IP422W's data stream.When I was still home and before my first trip that truly tests out these cameras, one of the cameras would be missing from the network and never to be seen again even after a reset.  Amazon promptly sent out a replacement but only after I discovered you really need to leave these cameras disconnected for more than a few minutes before it was really re-initialized.Then we went on our vacation and after a few hours into it, 1 of 4 cameras were MIA.  Still, it was fantastic to able to see our dog through the other working cameras.  However, by day 2, we were left with only 2 cameras working and on our way home, only 1 camera was working.  Of course, bear in mind, there's NOTHING you can do to fix it unless you get someone to go to your home, unplug and replug the camera's A/C adapter (a reboot).The following week, we went On our 2nd and longer vacation and it was pretty much the same story.  First, it teases you with much relief that it's working but then it never fails to disappoint with a non-functioning camera by day 2 or 3.  On our way home from this 5 day trip, only 1 camera was working.When we got home, I was bent on researching this further and opened two tickets with Trendnet, the 2nd one, they didn't even bothered replying.  Now dizzy with the experience of being able to check on the house when we're away, I was prepared to send the Trendnets back to Amazon and swap them for far more costly Toshibas, Sonys or Axises.But after much research, I quickly concluded that almost all of these IP cams just don't have very robust wi-fi components.  Most reviews were plagued with widespread reports of losing connections, reboots and the like.Still, I pushed forward, upgraded the router's firmware to DD-WRT, bumped up its transmitter range, added another router in as a repeater, relocated the routers to higher ground e.g.  I even tried swapping the antennae on the furthest camera with a longer antennae that came off an older Linksys router.  By now, there is probably sufficient signal strength in my house to service the neigboring five streets!!But of course, one camera or another will still continue to drop out, never to be heard from again  until they are rebooted.  I supposed it would have been great if they will self re-connected again sometime later but they never did, not even once.The geek in me then went into innovation mode, perhaps I can set up a script, reboot them every two days, use X10 power modules and restart them remotely.  Then my wife gently reminds me we just spent a grand on cameras that have questionable functionality.At this point, I bid kudos to those who have written about this same topic, about futile attempts to troubleshoot wi-fi problems, about even with the router next to the camera, it STILL loses connections.  The optimist in me finally agreed, my wi-fi network is not the problem, THESE CAMERAS DON'T WORK WELL WITH WI-FI.  Not that the wi-fi don't work at all, it's just that they don't work consistently.So finally, I bit the bullet and reluctantly HARD-WIRED ethernet connections to all the cameras.  I had explored using POE and possibly Homeplug to ease the installation pain but they added more point-of-failures and cost quite a bit more as well.  I eventually opted to punch holes into the wall, fishing e.g. and did the hard-wired routine.It's been a week since my wiring/stucco/drywall/painting work has just completed and the cameras have been live 24x7 without a hiccup.All in all, the IP422W is great, has a good enough picture, decent IR, great low-light capabilities to 15 feet, unmatched panning angles and more importantly, good value for the money.  Just don't expect an optical zoom or a continuously functioning wi-fi.", "Date": "September 2, 2009"}, {"Title": "Good for Watching the Kids", "Author": "Karl Bielefeldt", "ReviewID": "R39V716QFJVS1P", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "We bought this camera to keep track of our kids at home in their playroom, and to keep an eye on our daughter, who occasionally has seizures at night that are hard to detect just by listening.  This system is a little bit of overkill for that purpose, but the following are some things that made us settle on this camera instead of a more generic baby monitoring video system:* It's encrypted, so people can't spy on what's going on inside our house.* It's digital, so it works with all the wifi internet connections in our neighborhood instead of interfering with and being interfered by them.* It's online, so I can check in on the kids and feel like I'm part of the family when I'm at the office.The camera uses a regular wifi internet connection, and you open up the camera's web page to view the video.  There are controls on the side of the web page that allow you to move the camera around, turn the sound on and off, and things like that.  There are 8 presets you can label that will instantly move the camera to spots you select, which is a great feature.  There is a button to cycle through all 8 presets once and then return to where it was looking before.  You can set up guest users who don't have access to the controls, but can just view the video stream.Despite having quite a few options, configuration was relatively easy, with all the options available on a separate setup web page.  They did a good job of laying out the menu heirarchy to make things easy to find, although there were enough configuration options that I missed some the first time through.Some of the drawbacks are:* Some things only work on Internet Explorer using ActiveX controls.  That's not a problem for almost everyone unless you happen to use Mac or Linux, like me.  The basic functionality is all there, except for sound.  I was able to work around that, but it seems odd to take the effort to support other browsers and operating systems with a java applet, then stop short of full functionality.* The full manual is only on the CD-ROM, the only printed manual is a quick installation guide.* The camera doesn't tilt down very far, which creates annoying blind spots when you set it on a shelf or something.  However, there is a mounting bracket that we used to mount it upside-down, which gave us the full range of motion we needed.  There is a configuration option to flip the image back upright.* I wish it had a zoom, but the wide angle lens is a good choice if you have to have a fixed lens.* The camera occasionally needs to be rebooted after experiencing a heavy load.* The infrared illuminator doesn't come on automatically when it gets too dark, which is strange because the camera adjusts pretty well for brightness otherwise.  There is a night mode button on the web page.* Some of the configuration defaults are frustrating, like a 1 degree increment for pan and tilt.  That would be fine if you could just hold down the button, but the web page doesn't allow you to do that, and pops up an annoying message to \"Please wait\" whenever you click the buttons too fast.  The increment can only be changed on the setup page, but it's not a big deal because once the presets are set up, we hardly ever use the pan and tilt buttons.* I wish it had a feature to disable guest access during certain hours.  It would be nice to give access to the kids' grandparents out of state, but it would feel icky in the evening when we are all in pajamas to have people looking at us.  I think I can set up a schedule on my router firewall, though, and it does have a schedule and motion detection I could use to upload still images to the family blog.* It would be nice if the lights on the front indicated when someone was watching the video, not just if a link is established.However, the drawbacks are nothing that can't be worked around, and overall the camera exceeded our expectations.", "Date": "June 5, 2008"}, {"Title": "A decent camera with some minor glitches", "Author": "Consult This", "ReviewID": "RQN3KB2HBB94I", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "Overall a decent camera at a great price point. There are some minor glitches but none of those are deal breakers for me.Pros- Feature packed (Pan/Tilt, 2 way audio, night vision, wireless with WPA2 support, stream to IE/Firefox/3G phone, recording to NAS, just to name a few)- For $[...] including shipping, it's definitely the best bang for the buck at this point- Easy to install- Everything works for the most part once it's set upCons- Build quality: The first one I got from Amazon has very loud grinding noise when it starts up. The second one came without any problem though.- Stability: Whenever you restart or power down the camera, there is a possibility that you won't be able to connect to it after it comes back. I have seen the same problem on both cameras (with the latest firmware build 71). Usually the problem goes away after a few reboots, but it's quite annoying.- Constant background noise: This is a confirmed issue caused by an over-sensitive microphone. Apparently Trendnet is working on a fix for this.- Even though the camera has a built-in microphone, you can only capture video (not audio) when you try to schedule any recording to a network storage device.- Lousy tech support. They are not responsive, don't not know much about the product beyond the superficial stuff, and sometimes have difficulty to understand what I am trying to say (and vice versa)Other things I wish it has:- Support https so it's more secure when streaming over the Internet- Support authentication over RTSP. At this point, anyone with a 3G phone and the right URL can view your camera if you enable RTSP (Yikes!)- A privacy button to temporally disable the camera, or some scheduling capability to turn on/off the camera- Multiple profiles for motion detect so you can monitor different parts of the room depending on the time of the day- More intuitive event configuration", "Date": "August 1, 2009"}, {"Title": "Be Prepared to Call Customer Service - many times", "Author": "P. M. Gross", "ReviewID": "R27IDK35YINEKW", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I've spoken to customer service so many times to get this camera working that I've put them on speed dial!The good news is that they answer quickly and have a good data base to solve problems.  It would, of course, have been helpful if that info were on the web site.I am not going to repeat much of the features discussion here but rather, deal with installation other issues that I've learned and that may be useful:-Install both the IP Setup and the Secureview software.-Give the camera a Static IP address even if your router has a DHCP (not fixed) address.-Follow the installation instructions carefully,  The first task is to have your router recognize the camera's fixed IP address using IP Setup.-Make sure the camera is wired to the router; the router is hooked to your modem; everything is powered on.-Somewhere along the way, the program will ask you to install an active x control - perhaps more than once.  Make sure that you click on the appropate strip on the top of the page.-If the camera's IP address appears in the IP Setup window and you click it but can't get a picture, try Secureview.  If that works, then there is a problem with IE.-Especially if you have IE 8 or Windows 7, be prepared to download and install the newest software (you may have to connect the camera directly to your computer and follow instructions carefully). You might also try Tools - Compatibility View on IE.-Once you get a picture, note that the camera has a manual focus on the lens.  Watch the picture on your computer and slowly turn the lens from the edge with one finger without blocking the picture.If you plan to go wireless within your network:-Make sure that you have the IP address of your router (192.168.0.1, for example - look it up by brand on the web).  Also, any router user name and password you set up (default is probably admin.admin).  Also the encription key you put in.  If you need any of this and don't have it, you may have to reset the router and run the router set up again.-From Setup-Network-Wireless. Check Enable. Click on Site Survey, highlight your own home network, make sure the name appears in the box, set up the same encription and key that you set for other items that access your router. Click all the appropriate boxes.-Remember to disconnect the camera from the router, power it down and then up again.If wireless works and you want remote access, then note the following:-It will be necessary, especially if other items (TIVO, printer) are connected to the network, to change the port (Settings - Network - Network).  Your IP may also block port 80.  I went to 8001 to avoid problems.-You will need to go to dyndns to get a dynamic address.  Access the site from the computer you are using to install the camera so that dyndns has a starting IP.  You will create a user name and password and select a dyndns account name.-Log into your router and follow the router instructions to Port Forward 8001 or whatever you selected in the camera setup.  Once port forwarding is activated, you probably do not have to enter the dyndns information in your router.  You may not have to put in the DDNS settings in the camera network setup page either.-When you access your camera remotely, remember to start the address with http and end with :8001 (or your forward port).  It should look like: h t t p: / / (username) . dyndns . org: 8001 (no spaces).-There are issues setting up email and ftp forwarding.  The camera will not deal with encripted email servers nor will it change the smtp port from 25.  I have been unable to configure it to send email.-If you use FTP, note that the host address should be in the form of 00.00.00.00, not (ftp or h__p).On balance, this camera works more or less as advertised.  The picture is reasonable in good light; somewhat grainy in poor light.  The lens needs to be properly focused.  Digital zoom does not give a sharp picture. The panning range is impressive. I wish that the software were more up to date; that it could send encripted email through a different port and that the instructions were better.Still, this may be the best available for the price at this time.UPDATE 9/10. FTP UPLOADS.As noted, it is possible to use the camera's motion detect features to take photos and upload them to an FTP site than can be accessed through the internet.Research shows that some FTP sites have a monthly maintance fee.  I have been using a site called: transferum . com that provides limited but adequate FTP storage.  There is a one-time $1.00 fee (paypal) to join but no continuing fee, and members set a unique username and password.  The site can be accessed using an http command; specific FTP software is not required.  Pictures remain on the site until deleted by the user.  Note again that the when setting the camera, the FTP site must be referenced using its 00.00.00.00 address form.", "Date": "June 8, 2010"}, {"Title": "Actually works just fine with Mac OS X,  Safari and TimeCapsule", "Author": "Giraldus", "ReviewID": "R1YWO4B3UVT42M", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I bought this item after reading the reviews,  expecting some limitations since multiple reviewers pointed out that one couldn't get the full functionality of this device without running Microsoft Windows and Internet Explorer, so I was pleasantly surprised to find out the following:  For one thing,  you can configure the camera entirely from Mac OS X / Safari.  Second thing,  once the latest version of the firmware is installed (I am currently running with 1.1.0 build 77),  one can control the camera entirely from Safari (it no longer requires Windows Internet Explorer specific ActiveX,  I mean,  it still works with ActiveX,  but it supports multiple profiles that work without -- and I have the full functionalities,  including sound,  camera control,  preset configurations,  on my Mac running Mac OS X and Safari).

I also bought the eyeCam iPhone app (mentioned by another reviewer)  which works perfectly with this camera.One thing that I have learned by talking with Trendnet tech support (who are very responsive by the way),  is that after having upgraded the firmware,  one must i) reset the camera and ii) reconfigure it,  otherwise you'll encounter some glitches.The one thing that would make this camera better would be https support...  but they seem to be actively improving the firmware,  so who knows.I put only one star for the documentation,  because it is rather basic (works fine for a simple setup,  and is mostly a walk through the setup web based utility), and it didn't mention anything about Mac OS X support (which is odd...);  that said,  their customer support seems to be top notch,  so I wouldn't hold that against them.Oh,  one last thing:  multiple vendors on Amazon offer the same item,  with different prices,  so it pays to look around what is available on Amazon before placing your order.", "Date": "September 22, 2010"}, {"Title": "Best used at night/low level light", "Author": "Alfred E.

Having both camera's working side by side, there are many major differences (these being the highlights) ...>  In daylight situations, the Panasonic is a bazzilion times better.  However, when the sun goes down (or other low level light situations), this TRENDnet is excellent ... the Panasonic barely works.>  On the TRENDnet, administratively set video settings apply to everyone (this one setting viewed by all).  On the Panasonic, each user/client can set their own video configs independently ... different video streaming resolution, snapshots every so many seconds, etc.  This makes the Panasonic indispensable for client access by Android cell phones, etc. (not possible with the TRENDnet)>  On the TRENTnet, the flaky wireless (reported by others) definitely exists, the Panasonic is rock solid.  I've noticed the TRENDnet base gets really warm ONLY when wireless is enabled ... so maybe overheating is the issue?>  The Panasonic has on-board memory for snapshot/video capture.  The TRENDnet requires a memory card plugged into the USB slot.>  The TRENDnet comes with a mounting bracket that is right-angled ... so can mount from the horizontal base side --OR-- 90 degree (vertical) side from the base.  The Panasonic has no mounting bracket, however it has a 1/4\"-20 threaded hole on it's back side, suitable for universal camera tripod mounting.>  The TRENDnet can be configured for generic Dynamic DNS service (which I never tried to make work) ... you have to have your own DDNS service account setup somewhere.  The Panasonic includes custom Dynamic DNS service proprietary with the camera (Panasonic maintained) ... THIS WORKS EXCELLENT out of the box, no-brainer.  It may not seem like DDNS is a big deal, until you realize your ISP service changes your IP address every other day, and there are lots of people that want to access your camera (that you now have to keep informed) ... and you yourself need to know your IP address when away at work, etc.So, in the end the night vision wasn't nearly as important (to me) as all the other comparisons.  I've taken the 15% restocking fee hit and RMA'd the TRENDnet camera, soon to purchase a second Panasonic camera.

No desktop use.I scanned various cameras at different price points. From cheap Chinese models all the way through the AXIS pro models. If you have the budget, the AXIS is by far superior to anything else out there on the consumer level (even commercial) in my opinion but at around $1000 price point.I decided on the Trendnet TV-IP422W for several reasons.a) Supports wired or wireless networkb) pan tilt zoom control (with 8 presets to quickly scan the room)c) Android access and full control with sound! You'd be surprised how many droid apps do not support sound. AXIS and TRENDnet are they only two I could find that included all the features listed here with sound on a droid.d) Again, sound to hear the baby. A very important feature for baby monitoring. Also has the capability to add an external speaker for 2 way communication.e) Remote viewing via DDNS so you can tap into your camera and sound from anywhere in the world you have internet access including from your mobile devices and desktop via your browser.f) Color. It's white. I really didn't want to make my baby's room look like a convict lived in thereg) Design. Again, I really didn't want a honkin' camera or dome camera in the room making it look like a jail cell. This camera at least looks friendly.h) Price! considering the features, it was worth every penny and is the same price as the Summer Baby Monitor.i) USB connection for external drive to act as a recording storage right at the device level for high quality captures.There are some things to consider. No support for iPhone (can't seem to get it going even with trendnets app). The wireless signal is bandwidth heavy (like any streaming AV) so if you don't have a strong router, you might be disappointed. Good news is that you can control the image quality that allows you to adjust to your bandwidth limitations. I run 3 wireless laptops, 3 mobile devices and 3 wired machines through my Belkin WNDR3700 dual band gigabit wireless N router along with a Belkin gigabit switch and it's very stable. My Cisco WRT54G2 with factory firmware and Cisco WRT54G1 with ddwrt firmware \"upgrade\" couldn't handle it at all.The camera acts as a baby monitor in the evening via the tablet on the nightstand streaming live video and audio, and plugged in and set to 'never sleep while plugged in', the tablet is very loud and the picture quality very acceptable and much better than the Summer Baby Monitor. I did degrade the image quality to better control bandwidth but it's legible, you can zoom in nicely, and the sound has about a 500ms to 1 second latency. As a mater of fact, as does the video stream. White noise is surprisingly low. I don't notice it most of the time but if the volume is over 70% it's pretty annoying but that's standard with all other solutions as well. Compared to the Summer Baby Monitor, quality is better with the biggest benefit being range. Summer's solution constantly dropped the signal which is extremely frustrating when you're trying to monitor your newborn while doing stuff around the house.My setup described above is much more stable but not perfect. It does drop the occasional signal but nothing too concerning as it picks it right back up in a minute or so. So far it has been perfect in every way for our needs and range is absolutely incredible.Next step is to wire the camera to an ad-hoc router via a powerline network (went with the Western Digital 200Mbps Livewire AV Kit - awaiting delivery from Amazon) to see if I can increase to a high quality stream without affecting the throughput of the main router and without having to run network cable across the house. My plan is to isolate the baby monitor network and only port forward from the main router when accessing from the outside and keeping the wireless to a minimum from the mobile devises to the router only. Theoretically it should work just fine but is yet to be determined and tested.

If you use the wireless feature the performance drops quite a bit so plan on hard-wiring it with ethernet. Your better of sticking with a Cisco product (which by the way is really a linksys product) since the support is very good and the monitor software (recorder/monitor) works and the is capable of up to 16 camera's.This camera is suppose to have night vision but it also is broken and is worthless. My advice is to go with a true night vision camera for that portion of your security and stick with a day camea like a Cisco that has a true optical zoom. The digital software zoom is not worth much.

Had it streaming video off the wired connection within 10 minutes. Wireless went pretty well, too. (using Windows Vista 64-bit)2. Picture quality is surveillance-cam quality, not web-cam quality, as might be expected. Wish it were better, but it will do.3. I figured out how to get it to stream over the internet with a little searching. Here is the short version of what you need: A) a router set up with a Dynamic DNS service (free ones are available) B) Forward the (static) local IP address of your camera through your router as another port. Now you can connect to it over the Internet at no cost.4. The Chrome web browser does not let me move the camera, or zoom in, or access somne other features.  MS Internet Explorer shows all of the features.Overall, I'm very satisified w/the camera. The only thing that costs it a star is the picture quality. I was hoping for better.UPDATE: The camera has locked up and failed completely. As of 2 weeks ago, the camera would not boot itself up when powered up. I cannot connect to the camera over my local network at all. Looks like a dead unit. I've contacted TRENDnet customer support and I'm in the process of sending it back to be replaced. On some other review websites, it seems others have had some problems with the machine dying on them (looks like high infant mortality rate). When it's working, it's pretty cool, but we'll see how the reliability is with this next one. Downgraded to 2 stars for now.UPDATE 2: Replacement camera has been working mighty fine.

If Ethernet is plugged in the WiFi is disabled.POSITIVE:Supports 640x480 image, many other IP cams support a lower resolution image like 320x240. In my opinion an IP camera should have nothing less than 640x480 resolution.Supports both MJPEG as well as MPEG4 compression.Supports RTSP streaming video, with or without audio (untested by me)For a Pan/Tilt IP camera this has a really good price.Cam has IR night vision functionality (and includes 7 Infrared LEDs so it can see in total darkness for approx 10-15 feet)Cam has manual focus so it can be adjusted to focus on what you set it to.Motor movement noise is very quiet.Camera has a built-in mic so it can also capture audio.Camera also has a speaker out port so it can be used as a 2-way intercom (not tested by me).Camera has a GPIO port (i.e. general purpose input/output port) so you can hookup an input (magnetic alarm sensor etc) and an output to the camera and control via software. Although I have not tested this yet this should be very convenient for WiFi operation as no additional wires need to be run back to the PC.Camera has a status LED that can be switched off to be more inconspicuous.Steel mounting bracket is included, along with the necessary screws.NEGATIVE:The camera takes approx 50-60 seconds after powerup or reset before being ready. I wish this startup time was quicker.Focus control (turning the lens ring) is difficult to adjust as it is small and your fingers usually obscure the lens when adjusting. So what you have to do is turn a bit, move fingers, turn back a bit, etc until you're happy.The included software is crap. I took the advice of fellow reviewers and spend $50 on BlueIris which is much better software and well worth the price.When powered up or reset the camera auto centers itself. I think there should be a firmware update that allows the camera to move to one of the user-programmed positions upon power-up. Otherwise in some cases the auto-centered view where you mount the cam will not ideally give you the scene that you want.I wish the cam would be able to Tilt downward more. I usually mount these high so people can't tamper with them but the max downward tilt angle is not very much. An option is to mount the cam with the bracket upside down and flip the image vertically in the cam's web setup page.IMPROVEMENTS THAT I FEEL SHOULD BE MADE FOR FUTURE PRODUCT MODELS:1. Wireless 802.11N support. This would give better range and be able to support more cams over a wireless network.2. Put a true auto-removable InfraRed (IR) filter on the camera sensor. There doesn't seem to be an IR cut filter on the camera which means that for normal day operation certain colors may be off somewhat (some reds or blacks). True Day/Night cams have an IR filter that is present for \"Day\" color mode to maintain color accuracy and is removed from the sensor light path when light levels fall and the camera switches to \"Night\" Black&White; mode.3. Have a model that uses a Pixim DPS CMOS sensor for much better dynamic range. As it is the camera is not very good if you want to view a scene that is strongly backlit, like a glass shop storefront where lots of light comes thru. Yes, there is an \"outdoor\" setting in the setup page but this may not help all that much.4. It would be nice if the mic audio could have some sort of filter feature to reduce background noise in noisy environments (maybe just restrict audio bandwidth to 4KHz like phone network does so speech is easier to understand).5. Have the Focus control adjustable via software (i.e. remotely)OTHER TIPS:I set all the 422W cams to a static IP address to avoid problems with DHCP address allocation. This is a bit more work but ensures that the camera's IP address will always be the same. This may fix reviewers' issues that the cam has to be reset at various times.The black button at the back of the cam is the \"unmount USB device\" button. For some reason this is ONLY described on the packaging box and is NOT in the printed manual so if you throw away the box you might think that the black button is the reset button and then get confused when it does nothing.Still, it's a good product for the price. I hope followup products fix the issues pointed out above.***ADDITIONAL FOLLOWUP NOV2009***1. Now that I've been using these for a few months I can better comment on the reliability. Despite allocating each cam a static IP address there have been occasions where the camera USING A WIRELESS CONNECTION has stopped working and must be manually reset (unplug then plug back in). Personally I find this intolerable when it occurs (which admittedly is not very often) as the whole point of a camera is to record evidence and if it stops working unnoticed then it's useless. A suggestion for the firmware programmers: Allow a programmable option to reset the wireless every x days, this may help with the problem. However this problem seems to occur ONLY if the WIFI is enabled, if you are using a WIRED connection then I have not seen this problem. I think there might be a bug with regards to wireless functionality. However if you're going wired then a better option might be the Trendnet IP422 or IP410 (without the W suffix) as these models may be cheaper.2. Since my purchase I have noticed the price on this camera go up. I paid two hundred per cam, and as of this writing it is higher than that! If you don't need the Pan/Tilt functionality there are cheaper cameras such as the Linksys WVC80N or Dlink DCS-1130 (which both support Audio & 802.11 N Wireless as well as wired Ethernet). These may offer better reliability for Wireless connections.3. The one really good feature this camera has in the setup web interface menu is that you can do a site survey and get an idea of what other networks the camera's WiFi is seeing and the signal strength %. I have not seen this feature in other IP cameras. This is really useful in positioning and getting an idea of interference from other WiFi networks and also what sort of improvement can be gained by replacing the stock antenna with a higher gain one.FEB2012 UPDATE: Just wanted to say two things:1. There is a critical firmware bug in older firmware which allows someone to view images BYPASSING AUTHENTICATION. If you have a TV-IP422W with firmware lower than V1.1.1 build 95 your camera is INSECURE!2.

I've got it set up perfectly behind a double firewall so that I can use a local address from within my home network or so that I can access the router through DDNS outside my home (like when I'm on vacation, office, or anywhere where I can have wifi access).  There are two major hurdles (maybe 3 if optical zoom is considered):1) The Infrared LED lamps that surround the lens turn on automatically in dim light conditions.  Since this camera can only be an indoor camera and if you put it near a window or anything that is reflect EMR, the camera basically becomes useless.  This is why this camera cannot be used with an enclosure and this is the main reason why I said that this camera is for indoors only (besides the fact that the power adapter is for indoors).  If you want a camera to see outside in the dark or dim lighting through a window, the cousin camera IP-410WN will be a better option since it does not have the Infrared LED lights.  I really don't know why Trendnet didn't think to have a manual or a configurable option to turn off the IR LEDs or supply a filter that will block out the reflected Infrared radiation.2) The second and most annoying thing about this camera is that it needs to be rebooted every so often due to overheating.  At first, I thought it was my routers that were causing the problem.  I also thought that the disconnected state may be an improperly configured network as well.  But, I discovered that even after unplugging and plugging the power source back in after 5 to 10 seconds, the camera is still not back on the network.  I double checked all my network settings, rebooted my routers, and even hardwired the network cable to the router (which works even when the camera is overheated).  Then, I discovered that the camera's underside is very hot.  So, I let it cool down and rebooted it.  After that, it works.  I tried to raise the camera off a flat surface in hopes it'll cool down.  But this doesn't seem to work.  One thing that seems to work is if it was sitting on top of an old hard drive, which is all metal.  So, that go me thinking of putting it on a heat sink with a fan.  Currently, I don't have a flat small heat sink and fan, but I put it on top of a steel plate with holes.  I'll see how long the camera will work before I have to cool it and reboot it again.There is another minor issue with the recording of the videos that I encountered.  Once in a while, when you press the manual record in IE, the camera will record for days on end without stopping.  Most times, when I press record and go out of the house, I find later that the recording stopped half an hour into recording or the recordings stop several hours in.  It's kind of unreliable.  I'm not sure if it's caused by the overheating issue or other network issues.It's too bad that the Infrared LED's cannot be turned off manually.  I think I can resolve the overheating issue myself.  And if this camera had optical zoom like the newer TV-IP612WN, this would be an awesome camera.  But that's why Trendnet made the IP612WN, but it's so expensive, it's priced itself out of the market.", "Date": "August 4, 2011"}, {"Title": "Only for the Professional Network Administrator", "Author": "maria spirenkova", "ReviewID": "RBH83DK184UFZ", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "The manual is technically in English but you can tell a non English speaking person wrote it, lots of interpreting needed throughout this technical manual.

I access this camera more through mobile devices than my computer so this was a win-win situation for me.A few pointers to hopefully save you some frustration as you set up (these are all things I ran into and had to troubleshoot):* Follow the instructions in the box setup the camera... don't worry about installing their SecureView software- you can use whatever you want to manage this later on.  You really just need to get the camera configured and running on your wifi network first.  Once you've made it that far you can then focus on the finer points.* Research port forwarding for your router. You'll need to forward the appropriate ports to the camera in order to allow it access.  It's worth noting here that the default port is 80 for this camera.  HUGE POINT HERE- some ISP's (your internet service provider) block forwarding on this port because its a major web port.  You will have NO WAY of knowing this.  Even if you set everything else up correctly, if your ISP blocks that port, you'll be left scratching your head wondering why it doesn't work. My suggestion is to change the port in the camera settings so that it uses something else, I used 8001.  This will save you a lot of trouble in the long run.* Be sure to enable audio in the camera settings, otherwise you won't be able to get any audio out on the app.* Highly recommend Tiny Cam for Android users- it works PERFECTLY with this camera!

Three minutes of reading the CD-ROM instructions and the camera was working wirelessly, versus five hours of tehcnical support!  I prefer to have quick-start instructions as a hard copy.I will add to this review once I have it mounted.  The camera produces a great deal of heat.  I would definately use the metal mounting bracket, to help dissipate the heat.  I hope this is normal, even though I have many small scale video cameras and none of them produce this much heat.

These include: software based motion detection that works unreliably, inability to specify a subject line on alert emails, poor user interface for setting scheduled alerts, and requires IE for full functionality.This camera does distinguish itself from the pack in a few areas, most of which other reviews have described in more depth: wide pan angle, low light, support for Firefox, quick/quiet panning, and WPA/AES WiFi encryption. Additionally I hooked up an external passive IR motion detector (GE AP100PI and a relay to invert the signal) to the GPIO input to achieve reliable motion detection. (This TRENDnet replaced a different brand pan/tilt camera that also had GPIO, but that feature never worked. Some Panasonic cameras have a built-in IR hardware motion detector. All IP cameras should have that feature.)I have one of these cameras installed in a remote location where it needs to operate unattended for many months at a time. After an initial short tryout period, the camera went offline after a few weeks. I don't know if it crashed or just lost its WiFi connection. I've since attached the camera's power supply to a timer so it gets power cycled once a week to force a periodic reboot. This has been working reliably for about a month so far. [UPDATE: over the course of 6 months, the cameras has gone offline for a week (until the next power cycle) many times, and for two weeks in a row once. I haven't determined whether it is a WiFi issue or the camera itself crashing.]One major problem is that the camera resets its pan/tilt position after powering up, and I need it to maintain a specific position. The prior p/t camera I had stored its position and after doing its power up calibration returned to the last set position. [UPDATE: more digging through the settings eventually uncovered a setting to specify what pan/tilt preset the camera should default to on power up.]The UI for setting scheduled alerts (i.e. email me a snapshot every 12 hours) is a pain to get to work correctly. You typically end up getting a bunch of snapshots sent instead of one. I ended up using code running on another computer to retrieve images at the desired interval. This also let me set the subject line as desired.Lastly, after a firmware upgrade, the user interface has lost the pan/tilt controls. I noticed this just before leaving the remote location, and after reloading the camera's configuration, the problem seemed to be fixed, but it later returned. The only advice TRENDnet has been able to offer so far is to do a hard reset on the camera. Something I can't do remotely. [UPDATE: I investigated this further and determined the specific flaw in the cameras HTML output that was causing the problem (a missing JavaScript value), but TRENDnet would not offer any further assistance in determining what camera setting might be triggering the problem. Like most consumer electronics companies these days, they are not equipped to handle anything other than mundane issues. I'd certainly think twice before considering one of TRENDnet's pro-grade products.]", "Date": "November 27, 2010"}, {"Title": "TrendNet Day/Night Wireless Camera", "Author": "James T.

You need to use the tab called  PROTOCAL AND USE BOTH. put under both global and local portS 80 and 80 and80.  Then  apply.  Now under the number 1) rule pick the name you just made.  on 2) select host. on #0 pick the tv- ip 422w it put the ip 192.168.1.28 Also you need to fix the ip port to static on web camera set up.  Also you need to go to the advance or mny network and enable remote so you can rich the camera from outside.  Do this set up and enable this general ip for the camera so it won't change its address everyday.Also the tech on trendnet were very helpful for the set up Trednet but didn't know anything about iphone and Westel verizon. They don't know about how to config port set up on other than their own which is reasonable.  If you need to know you Ip address use PING.eu and see if port 80 is working.

My wife and I both work in IT but our install was anything but simple: WinXP Pro SP3, running in VMware Fusion on a Macbook Pro running OS X 10.5.8, behind a Linksys G wireless router hooked to Time-Warner cable. So we had a few questions. Here's the deal: TrendNet's phone support was some of the best that either of us has encountered. Truly outstanding. We had to make two calls about some non-standard port-forwarding scenarios. Each time, no wait, and we got a patient, careful, methodical, well-informed person on the line who not only answered our questions but double-checked after each procedure. I'll add that the camera management software also strikes me as well-designed and solid with none of the flaky behavior so often associated with such stuff. I opened the package on a Saturday morning and my wife and I messed with the set-up and install off-and-on through the afternoon, as we mulled over its functions and features.

I decided to try the Trendnet TV-IP422W because of the very good reviews I read and also the fact that it has night vision and 2-way audio.  Neither of these features were offered on the Panasonic.The IP422W is a little difficult to set up.  As with most products these days, the owners manual is a bit lacking.  Luckily I had the experience with the Panasonic camera and wireless set up was very similar.  Additionally, one  of the prior reviews for this cam gave very good instruction on setting up wireless connection using static ip, which is what I had to do(Verizon FIOS router).The image is very good with the IP422W, and the night vision in a completely dark room is amazing.  Everything is black and white in night vision mode, but still amazing.  The ONLY problem with the night mode is that you can't turn it off.  When the light level drops to a certain point, the IP422W uses it's night imagery and sometimes it slightly obscures visibility in a room with weak lighting.  This is not a problem most of the time, but it would be great if the night mode had an on/off switch.Another nice feature is the 330 degree rotation.  The Panasonic cam could only do about 180 degrees.  And the 2-way audio works well (you need to connect computer speakers to the IP422W), but you must click on and off the talk and listen button so you and the person on the other end don't get the delayed feedback.  I don't think this is a major issue either, but something to point out.  One other thing the Panasonic cam had but not the IP422W is a DISABLE button on the front of cam that you could turn off at night for privacy, and turn ON remotely if you are administrator.  This camera can only be turned off by unplugging it.Overall I am very happy with this cam, but I think the low light images are better on the Panasonic cam, and microphone on IP422W is not as sensitive as the Panasonic cam.  I used to be able to hear someone leaving a message on my answering machine at home, and clearly hear the song on the radio in the background at home as well.  Now I can hear something, but cannot decipher a phone message or identify song now.  If someone is speaking, however, that is always clear enough to understand.

I bought this camera with the intent to purchase three more if it was a great product.  I would like to have three or four in my home so I can monitor remotely.Pros:1.  Fairly easy to configureI plugged it in to AC and ethernet.  I used a Win 7 box to run the installer that basically searches for the camera on my LAN.  I found it right away and gave it a static ip.  Reboot.2.  Works better than expected on my iMac under Snow LeopardI was able to see live streaming video using both Safari and Firefox under Snow Leopard.  I could also pan the camera with both browsers.  You lose digital zoom and audio, but I believe you can open quicktime and stream audio separately.  I did not try that part.3.  Solidly built product.4.  Tech support was available on a Sunday and with no hold time.5.  Great picture qualityIssues:1.  Live view under IE 8 and Win 7 64bit would not show video from the camera.  I could see the camera from the setup audio/video screen though.  I called tech support and was quickly connected with an agent.  She was very nice and attentive, but unable to resolve this issue.  She stated that IE 8 under Win 7 doesn't always work and she suggested I use Firefox.  I tried Firefox on the same Win 7 box and it did work by calling the quicktime plugin and was slow.2.  I could not access the camera using my Verizon Blackberry Tour's browser.  I could hit the camera's webserver, but had no access to controls and no picture.  I configured the 3GPP stream but never could get to it on the blackberry with the proper port forwarded.  When I put the camera in the DMZ, it would work.  I tried to troubleshoot this with Trendnet email support and found it to be abysmal.  I was told to forward ports 5002-5003, but these UDP ports are not configurable on the camera, only the TCP RTSP port.  Had I been able to stream to my blackberry, I would not have returned the camera.3.  I could not access the camera stream with my iPod Touch via Safari.  The browser failed to load the control icons and the video stream.  No iPhone support and it is 2010.  Disappointing.Conclusion:This camera, like many netcams, has IE ActiveX dependencies.  Surprisingly, I could not get it to work under Win 7 IE 8.  I normally use Firefox on my Mac, so this was not that big of a deal.  I also have XP on the Mac so the IE limitations were not a problem.  It would be great if manufacturers would not use proprietary coding in favor of open source functions available to many different OS and browsers.The real deal killer was not having any access using a mobile device.  Due to the webserver's dependancies on either java or activex, I could not view the camera using my blackberry or iPod Touch.  This means I would need access to a computer with internet to see the camera.  To the camera's credit, it did offer 3GPP mobile streaming, but I am fairly certain that Verizon blocks these streams.Considering this product costs over $200, not having access to the camera using my Blackberry was very disappointing.  Lack of iPhone support is another reason to look at a different camera.Overall, if you don't need access from mobile devices, and will access the camera from a PC or Mac with internet, this camera works.

Stability has been really good - over several weeks operation, using FTP Upload and Send Email on triggering, I haven't experienced the wireless dropout problems that some have reported.  I'm impressed with the setup flexibility available. My units are installed in corners, about seven feet high, mounted upside down.  The Mirror Vertical/Horizontal options make that a workable arrangement.It takes some time and expertise to set the cameras up, but the results are well worth the time.  I can check the cameras or change settings and positioning from anywhere via the Trendnet browser extension, or look and select presets from my iPhone via the Eyecam app.  The infrared capability is useful, as long as you are viewing over a very short distance.  It can't do a thing for a fully darkened room, though.  I'm considering getting a more powerful LED infrared lamp to provide full room lighting. Motion Detection works well, as long as distance to the motion is small, or nominal room lighting is available.There are a few minor shortcomings.  The 12v power adapter cord is too short to reach from the mounted position to a normally positioned wall plug, even if it is directly below the camera.  I ended up installing concealed duplex outlets inside the walls, with a double low voltage mounting wall bracket and cover plate for access, with flex plastic tubing from the plug area to the camera, for easy removal and replacement if the adapters should ever fail.  The orientation of the AC prongs on the adapter makes it impossible to plug them in with this inside-the-wall arrangement on a normal outlet, but a new duplex outlet made by 360electrical saved the day for me.  It allows the receptacles to be rotated, which worked like a champ to solve this unique problem.  To make the appearance of the cameras on the wall less unsightly, I also painted white over the black 12 volt cord from the rear of the cameras to the wall opening, and the black mounting screws. Not a big deal, but it really improves the appearance of the units.  I just wish Trendnet made a glass cover for the unit, though.The Listen feature works, but seems a bit weak to me.  I haven't tried the Talk feature, but it requires an attached powered speaker, and I don't see enough value in it for me to make that investment in time and money to set it up.UPDATE 1/4/11 - After over a year of zero problems keeping my cameras up and running on wireless connections, and NO disconnects, I replaced my Belkin n+ Router with a new Linksys E3000 a few days ago.  Since that changeover, I am now up to my ears in disconnects on both of my cameras.  I've been trying everything I can think of on the new router configuration, but nothing has improved it so far. I don't think signal strength is an issue, as one of the cameras is within 12 feet, or so, of the router.

First, customer service didn't know as much and I had to figure it out on my own - trying to setup the FTP/Email/Network Storage.

The \"Test\" button they have is a good idea, but all it does is tells you Succeed or Failed, it doesn't give you any diagnostics so can't easily trouble shoot.Secondly, the image quality is decent, Panasonic image was better, but low lighting was bad on this one. Currently, my baby monitor with Infrared has better image quality.Third, via the browser, you'll need ActiveX installed to use some of the features...What this means is that can only use Internet Explorer if you want to use those features.

For this purpose I needed:* Night vision capability* 2-way audio* Pan, tilt, zoom* Wireless LAN connection* Internet accessibleThis is one of the few cameras that has all these capabilities and the only one that I found anywhere near this price point. A key feature of this camera is its built-in web server, so you can connect to it from anywhere in the world over the internet using a web browser. There is no need to connect the camera to a host computer. Once connected, manipulating the camera is simple point-and-click.Setup on a home network requires some knowledge of TCP/IP configuration, wireless setup, and port forwarding, but is not complicated for someone with these skills.I also connected a Hawking hi-gain wireless antenna to the camera and the home's wireless router. You simply replace the stock antennas with the hi-gain antennas. This greatly improved connectivity.There are a few downsides:1. Picture quality in low/no light is very good, considering. But the quality is not great under good lighting conditions. Perhaps it's a tradeoff between night vision and day vision, but one that I'm willing to make to get the night vision capability.2. The zoom is digital, not optical. This means that a 2x or 3x zoom is just the normal image made bigger on your screen.

I have a shop building about 150 feet from the house and my plan was to put it in the window in the shop pointing back at the house with a wireless connection. Again that worked fine locally but I couldn't get access to it over the internet from a remote location.  This was very frustrating.  I also have a dvr with four cameras hard wired. Two inside and two outside looking away from the house.  I have been able to view them remotely with no problem.  I am using a DNS service to get the current IP.  My thought was that I can access the dvr remotely get the ip and then just change the port to access the camera but this didn't work regardless of the ports I set up and forwarded.  This was very frustating for several weeks.  Finally I realized that my dvr address 198.162.0.150 was different from my camera address 198.162.1.200. After I realized that I was able to do a more refined search on the internet and finally discovered the solution.  The problem was that I had a modem and a separate router.  However, the modem also had a dhcp server built in.  So I had to turn off the DHCP service on the router and put the router on the same subnet as the modem and then once I did that everything worked.  Here is the link to the article in port forwarding[...]Now that I have the camera working it works great.  I am also able to access the camera on my iphone using the \"cam viewer\" app.  Although it doesn't allow you to access the PTZ functions of the camera. I haven't tried using the microphone or speaker functions yet so don't have an opinion about them.Update: I have now had the camera for awhile and while I am still pleased with its overall performance, one serious problem with the camera is that it drops the wireless signal. Since this camera is to look over a second home it's value quickly lessons if you can't access it remotely. In the last three weeks it has dropped out twice on me.  On the first occaision I was able to have someone reset it for me and then it was good for another 3 or 4 days before it dropped again. Will have to figure out how to deal with that problem.2nd Update: I was still getting the wireless drop problem and so I bought a ZyXEL WAP3205 access point.

Harvey", "ReviewID": "RBESWCRZI4KLD", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I am giving this an overall rating of four stars for two reasons.  The first one is because they don't tell you to get a strong wireless router.  I had a Linksys (I am not knocking the Linksys brand) WRT120N which is not near as strong a signal to run multiple devices but i did not know that at first with this camera.  This camera takes up some bandwidth so get a good quality router such as the D-Link DIR-655 N+300.  This router works wonders with this camera and several devices within the home.  The other reason is because the average user may not be able to set this camera up for wireless.  The instructions to set them up for wireless for the average person is located here: [...].  They are using a Trendnet router but if you know what you are doing this is simple to set up for any other router.  It took me about 30-45 minutes to set up.  I am a Systems Administrator so this was not difficult to set up for me but it may be for others.One great thing about the user interface is once it is setup for other people to use you can create multiple users in different groups and the guest view does not let them move the camera.  The only thing that the guest users can do is look at the current view of the camera and listen to the audio.  You can turn that audio off if you do not want anyone to listen in.  This camera also has a auto patrol option that can be changed as far as time intervals go.  You can set each of the eight options to move between 1-999 seconds per location when using the auto patrol option.  It has 8 different patrol options that can be changed and renamed.  You can pan and tilt manually also.Overall this camera does exactly what I bought it for.  My wife wanted a way to view our son from work.  The user interface is very simple to operate.  Most of the settings can be changed remotely if needed, the picture quality is great during the day and at night, and the setup for users is great.

My dog is Bloodhound and everything that you've probably heard about their sensitive noses is completely true and worse!

However, if you're not a computer guru who knows all of the ins and outs to setting up your DSL router and webCAM, good luck.  I consider myself very tech savvy and I struggled with getting the router and camera to work together for quite some time.  Forget about the instructions that come with the camera, they are almost worthless.Here's a tip that I found on a third party web site almost as an afterthought.  If you want to use the \"Speaker Out\" feature, you have to supply the speaker!  Nowhere does TrendNet give you this little gem of information, or at least nowhere that I could find it.The camera \"looks up\" much further than it \"looks down.\"  So if you mount the camera high, (I mounted mine near the ceiling) you may need to mount it with a little down angle so that you can increase the field of view below the camera.  I mounted mine so that it looks straight down giving me the widest field of view possible.  Note that if you do this, the image will \"rotate\" as you pan the camera from side to side.The wireless works very well, again using the web based setup is a snap to setting up the wireless.  It has a lot of different security features that works with a wide range of Access Points.The zoom is a joke.  It's nothing more than like zooming in on a photo using your favorite picture viewer / editor.

It's cheaper then most companies selling the same item and you'll have the newer version with the updated software. This was a major reason why the other camera didn't work.3) The ability to view anywhere. On my computer and phone.4) The best app I found was 9.99. It's called \"IP Cam View.\" You can zoom,listen,etc. Works great for this type of camera.5) The 800 number!!! This is the best by far. Several companies don't even offer 24/7 service. These guys are good. A little tough to speak english but you can understand perfectly. DON'T HOOK UP ANYTHING WITHOUT CALLING THEM. CALL THEM FIRST AND HAVE THEM WALK YOU THROUGH IT. saves a big headache later.Cons:1) I'm having a problem saying this is a con but I have too. Hooking up any wireless web cam is not easy. Even with the 800 number helping me, it still took a couple hours.2) Remember you still have to contact your router company to get a few things so it works wirelessly unless you already know the ins and outs of your router.3) There should be a trendnet app for viewing. Instead I have to use a 3rd party to view. But that's ok.4) it promotes 2way audio. This is true but you have to attach a mic to both ends if you want this to work. You can listen but can't speak unless you do that.Bottom Line:Don't buy this camera from anyone other then Trendnet. They'll have all the updates on there cameras that other companies can't supply.
