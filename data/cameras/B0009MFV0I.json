The user manual was huge, the camera controls mystifying, and the pictures were blurry.  I blamed it on myself, thinking that I needed to read some books on photography.  I spent hours reading books about photography, trying to solve the soft focus problem (see?  I did learn something!  Blurry is called \"soft focus.\")  I thought my crummy pictures were my fault, after all, Canon was supposed to be the best!  A few months short of two years, my Canon died a weird death--one day, I turned it on, and the screen was awash in purple and red blobs. I was angry at Canon after reading that this was a common occurence and there was no fixing it.  But secretly, I was relieved.  I hated that thing.Holding my breath, I bought this EasyShare C330 camera with the dock.  I didn't believe it would take good pictures...after all, how can something \"easy\" be good?  WOW!!!  Was I delighted!  It really won this skeptic over.  The pictures are clear, and the camera is so easy to understand and use!  It narrates settings for you, it's easy to navigate, and it's a complete joy to use.  The software is amazing--you can take a completely unbalanced, over-dark picture, edit it with a one-touch \"enhance\" button--and you've got a perfect picture!  The color technology is amazing, too--gorgeous blues, vibrant reds; better than real life!  What a delight after that complicated, annoying Canon.Because this camera is such a joy to use, I find myself taking 20 times more pictures than I used to.  I cannot say enough good things about it...it has completely changed picture-taking for me.  Because I love taking pictures now, this camera has taught me more about photography than all the manuals and photography books I had to read.In a nutshell, I would recommend this camera to anyone who just wants to take a good picture.  Leave the \"F stops\" and \"exposure times\" to people who are interested in that sort of thing--I am definitely not.  This camera takes fantastic pictures, PERIOD.", "Date": "September 27, 2005"}, {"Title": "Great digital camera!", "Author": "Happy Customer", "ReviewID": "R1A170RHDSXD7P", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I have done extensive research on many kinds of digital cameras, from Canon to Olympus.  This camera was recommended by a friend who knows that most architectures and engineers on the field choose Kodak digital cameras for durability, sharp pictures and great price.  This camera is EASY to use and has many shooting modes.  It also is small, like holding a deck of cards.  Most of all it takes excellent pictures and the price is cheap in comparision to other cameras.  Best to upgrade the memory card to 512, it will take over 600 pictures.  Also, use recharable batteries and get a AC adapter.  Also, get a extended warrenty.  I got a 4 year one at Best buy for only $39.99.Dont' waste your money on other brands, if you want a simple, durable and great camera!!!", "Date": "August 2, 2005"}, {"Title": "The Swiss Army Knife of digital imaging...", "Author": "Steve Bradford", "ReviewID": "R3K7D2FA1VG96Z", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Todays digital amateurs and novices looking for a good camera have a plethora of choices: Huge mega-pixles, techno-savvy features, and then there's the varied prices. Yet the achilles heel of many digital cameras is they accel in some aspects, but disappoint in others. The Kodak C330 and its Kodak kin are spot-on in all three aspects. Specifically, the Kodak C330 is the Swiss army knife of digital photography.I have used Kodak digital cameras before and was impressed early with their ease of use, large screen, unimcumbered layout, and easy to use 'EasyShare' software. I shopped for Canon, Nikon, and Pentax cameras to get a sense of what features and prices I could expect. The Kodak C330 and kin first impressed me with their simple layout; big buttons, not those that resemble small cell-phone buttons. Second, the big and bright screen size made it easy to see the picture I took, even in direct sunlight. The simple menu on the camera made the learning curve short, thus giving me an out-of-the-box experience. It uses either SD or MMC cards for additional memory. I suggest going with SD memory as they hold more memory than the older MMC and are now fairly inexpensive. The zoom lens works efficiently and the zoom controls are a cinch to use. Another user-only discovery: The battery life in these cameras is amazingly long! Finally the EasyShare software was a joy to use: Simple and intuitive for both amateurs and novices alike: I easily maneuvered between taking Color,B&W;, and Sepia pictures. Transferring pictures from camera to PC was very quick!The only dissappointment was with the Kodak Retinar lens. I wish Kodak would have instead used their German Schneider-Kreutznach lens it uses in their upper cameras. The Schneider-Kreutznach lenses are superior to many, if not all the lenses I have seen in and on digital cameras. Likewise, please be forewarned of cheap digital cameras that use inferior lenses. I have learned that while some cameras are feature-laden with techno-gizmos, this sometimes conceals a inferior lens. After all, no feature on any camera is more tangible than the lens itself.The Kodak C330 is a great camera for those interested in digital photography and don't want to spend a fortune. You ought to consider this little Swiss Army knife of a camera. It will not disspoint!", "Date": "July 19, 2006"}, {"Title": "Wrong Battery included in package...BEWARE", "Author": "Peterack", "ReviewID": "RL9LV22BILPY8", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "For the most part this is a fine digital camera.

A friend swore that this camera takes great pictures so I bought it. No regrets. Im highly pleased with this camera. The pictures are very crisp. The most impressive feature to me is the video. My wife and I were amazed at how well it took movies, even the sound in the movies was far better than I expected. I bought a usb hard drive and back up all the videos and pictures I take. Knowing that my pictures are safe forever is fantastic.Only 2 things I don't like. One is that the batteries dont last that long. This is typical of digital cameras compared to 35 mm. The other is red-eye. Kodak software that comes with the camera can remove it but I have been using adobe photoshop as it works far better. There is also an option on the flash to limit red-eye and this indeed helps but doesnt eliminate the problem entirely.", "Date": "January 6, 2006"}, {"Title": "Exactly What I was Looking For", "Author": "T.

I have two really great SLR cameras but I was tired of having to lug them around when all I want is a few pictures of my kids at the zoo or something.  This camera takes nice pictures, it has a tripod mount and timer for those group shots, and it is really easy to use.  There are several settings that I haven't played with yet but my husband has had fun with the TL setting, a strobe light, and some glow sticks.  Of course the best part is you only need to print what you like which along with the small size is the other reason to switch to digital.  We didn't use the software it came with but all I had to do was plug the cable into the camera and a usb port and the pictures were right there. Overall I would recommend this camera to anyone looking for a first digital camera and anyone looking for an affordable digital camera that is easy to use and takes nice pictures.", "Date": "September 24, 2005"}, {"Title": "Very good camera, especially for the price", "Author": "PGMS \"PGMS\"", "ReviewID": "R3920781R0KJ1I", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "This inexpensive 4MB point-and-shoot digital camera provides a lot of bang for the buck. Although it does not \"feel\" as sturdy as competing Nikons (the switches seem a bit cheaper here), the camera works well, and is actually easier to work with. The software included is better than what you get from Nikon as well. And, the easy interface with Kodak Gallery for online storage is an additional plus. Though they do not recommend using regular alkaline batteries, they will work, as will a rechargeable Li-on, though again, they do not mention it in their manuals.The camera offers multiple settings for special situations. Although not perfect, I did find that the camera shutter for \"kid scene\" was an improvement over the standard setting for children moving around a lot. Also, the on-camera menus were easy to understand. A nice feature is that you can access the in-camera memory even when a memory card is inserted - Nikon does not allow that.Overall, this is a highly recommended camera for those on a budget.", "Date": "August 22, 2005"}, {"Title": "Very user friendly", "Author": "Jack", "ReviewID": "R3NG0WOHP9EISU", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I have to say this is a great camera, especially for someone that doesn't have a lot of experience. Kodak goes out of it's way to make this as user friendly as it can. The dial on top allows you to pick what type of setting (normal, scenic, action, etc.) you are going to be taking pictures with, the downloading of pictures to the computer is a snap and if you want to share it with your friends/family online the ease of use to get the pictures to a webpage using ofoto/kodak.com couldn't be easier. It takes very nice quality pictures and with a 512MB SD card can hold well over 600 pictures at 4MP and nearly 30 minutes of video. The video quality was much better than I anticipated although not great and I thought the picture quality was outstanding. I was actually able to make out the individual whiskers on my face after I transferred the picture to my computer and I zoomed in. Also the battery life was excellent on the camera, even with experimenting and transferring and deleting and just generally putzing around they lasted quite awhile.There are some drawbacks, although it's to be expected for the price, you do need an SD card, the camera can't even take 20 pictures without one so make sure you buy one with the camera. The camera is not going to take rapid fire, pictures. You need to focus on the item for a second with the button partially held down before pushing it in all the way to get a real crisp picture and there is about a 2 second wait before the camera is ready to take another picture. I did get used to that surprisingly quickly even though I thought it was going to make me dislike the camera at 1st. If you just try to take quick pictures one right after the other the quality and focus is off. Once you get the hang of it though. it's a snap but you do have to be prepared to wait a few seconds between pictures. IMHO There are better cameras out there but they are going to cost you quite a bit more from what I found. I think this is a great camera with a lot of nice features for the price, especially for someone that generally doesn't like/get along with electronic devices.", "Date": "March 21, 2006"}, {"Title": "Very nice little camera!

My sister has a Kodak so I decided to use that one.I'm very impressed! I've only had it for a week, and have not yet put it through the paces of picture taking...just a few here and there. The real test will be out on the road. So far so good.

The only drawbacks are that the C330 doesn't have a battery status indicator, however, a battery icon  will pop up when the batteries are just about to quit. Also it would be nice to see a numeric zoom factor reading on the LCD. Instead there is a simple vertical line marked \"w\",\"t\" and \"d\".

There is a lag time between when you click the switch to take a picture and when the shutter engages.  It takes about 1-2 seconds and anything in motion is out of the frame by that time.  Please tell me if I am doing something wrong but this is my experience.  It eats batteries and when the battery finally dies the camera gets stuck with the lense out and you cant retract it.

I recorded lots of videos with it. The only drawback there is you can't zoom in and out during videos, only before you start recording. Then it's fixed there.

This Kodak has a nice optical zoom, though I have trouble using the digital zoom.  You can't use the digital zoom through the viewfinder, only the lcd screen on the back.

Apparently it's me, and not the camera itself, because many reviews here say the pictures come out nice and clear.  But even if I'm sitting perfectly still, taking a picture of something that's also perfectly still- the picture still comes out fuzzy.  I have to resize it to be much smaller to get it to look decent.  But I'm assuming this is something I'm doing wrong, since so many people have praised the picture quality.Other than that problem, this has been a great camera for as long as I've owned it.  I took it to summer camp, and it managed to survive hiking, canoeing, and the bus ride there and back without any harm.  The batteries did run out several times on the trip- the screen seems to suck up batteries like crazy.  The pictures (once I resized them to get rid of fuzziness) were great and the video feature was surprisingly good as well.  Also I was surprised at how many pictures I could take with the memory card- I didn't even come close to filling it up, on a week-long camping trip.

This one, after having it for almost a year and a half won't accept my batteries anymore. At first I thought it was my AA battery charger wasn't working so I bought some regular AA batteries. They last, honestly for less than 5 pictures, then the camera just shuts off with the lens open.The pictures are pretty good quality. My computer frequently doesn't read my camera. When I'm uploading pics I have to turn the camera on/off and un/plug the cord multiple times for my computer to recognize it. That could be a problem w/my comp, the camera, or software, I'm not sure but it's a nuissance.Anyways I vote do an EasyShare camera if you're looking for a cheap fix to last you a year or two until you can either afford/be responsible enough for a nicer one.", "Date": "May 29, 2007"}, {"Title": "The Camera Gift", "Author": "Meriel P.

The pictures were okay (it's only 4 MP, so...) but good quality. The micro setting worked well. The video is passable, thankfully -with- sound. The software could use work, the upload times are wonderful but the editing/organizing I didn't even bother with since I use a third party editor. I have had a few problems with the software updater causing system errors, etc. The optical zoom made zoo trips and park play dates a shoe-in for great pics, keep the clarity without having to be close.The problems lie in: weight, bulk, low megapixels, choppy software, durability.Buy if you're anally perfect with your gadgets.Beware if you have a toddler and bit of a scattered mind at times.", "Date": "December 5, 2006"}, {"Title": "Wonderful Camera", "Author": "Leah D.

It's very light weight even with batteries installed.In all fairness I must state no matter the quality of the pictures I cant get past the cheapy,cheap feel of this camera.The lcd screen is also very tiny... though very crisp and colorful under all conditions. The pictures are just ok ... they lack a certain crispness and the color is slighty off to me.My brother says it's fine but I think he say's that cause he doesnt want to hurt my feelings. I would have returned the camera to amazon and spent more to get something better but he had already opened and played with the camera.They also do not include a video out cable with the camera.Also,while the camera records sound during video mode  it DOES NOT play sound back during review on the camera. It plays sound when played on your computer or tv screen.In closing may I kindly suggest passing this camera up and getting something a little bit better.UPDATE:My brother has had this over a year now and he LOVES IT !  It takes great  very sharp pictures and has held up well. He takes tons of photos with it and he says the battery life is very good. The finish that I had said felt cheap has also held up well.
