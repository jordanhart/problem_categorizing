Basically, for me it comes down to this:  If I'm using my 12-40 F2.8 'pro' zoom lens or the upcoming 40-150 F2.8 'pro' lens I'll use the E-M1 with the requisite battery grip.  If I'm using one of the dinky little wonderful prime lenses I tend to use my E-M5.  Image quality is nearly identical, and it comes down to balance and ergonomics. For formal events or weddings my primary weapon is my E-M1.  And as I happen across opportunities to use the prime lenses, particularly in low light, I shift over to the E-M5.  But the beauty of having this system of cameras and lenses is I can configure any way I like.  So the E-M1 is the king of the hill with its amazing image stabilization and wonderful access to camera adjustments.  And for situations where the more compact configuration is advantageous I go for the E-M5.  The main thing is to get the camera that feels good to you and then get out there and snap away.  The E-M1 is the superior camera, but I'm a sucker for all things cool and little where the E-M5 still gets the nod.", "Date": "January 31, 2014"}, {"Title": "Single Kit - Camera & Lens", "Author": "Nathan M Dornquast", "ReviewID": "RE8YGY3WYCLH4", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "There have been many reviews for the camera and lens by people much more qualified than I.  I will add, however, that coming from an om-d em-5 (previous gen); I am very pleased with addition options (wifi, HDR+, viewfinder, display, grip, etc).  Especially happy with button layout - which on the 5 was always problematic for me (small, hard to reach).What I will contribute is to this OMD EM1 + 12-40mm kit.  I was not sure what to expect.  I have not seen any similar kit locally in the USA.  Here, I would spend $1399 for camera body and $999 for separate lens.  +tax.  I was especially concerned as Seller sells some \"grey market\" products.  No worries.  This is an Olympus camera + lens kit.  Fully retail items.  Items are packaged in same box from Olympus.  Will upload photo of box.  I don't have any issues with this.  Appears full retail products with nice lens bag, caps, etc.New EM-1 and 12-40mm F2.8 very powerful combination.Ordered from D-Solutions Saturday night.  Paid ~$15 for expedited 3 day shipping.  They shipped from Korea Monday.  I received (MN, USA) Tuesday at noon.  W00t!Update.  I don't see how to upload photo to Amazon anymore.  If someone tells me; I will add photo of box.Posted pic:http://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-media/permalink/mo17CIDN5T8IUIV/B00EY6AV3W/ref=cm_ciu_images_pl_link", "Date": "February 25, 2014"}, {"Title": "FAST!!!

It's not too small and not too big.  Even with the lens the camera isn't heavy.The camera and lens are fast and smooth.  I can catch my little 22 months old running around easily.  I had a very hard time with my older camera.  I would recommend this camera to anyone who's looking at getting a camera and have the budget.  This kit won't disappoint you.I also want to thank D-Solution for express shipping (DHL) this baby out to me within 3 days.  I ordered the camera on Sunday, and it was shipped on Tuesday and got here on Wednesday.  WOW!  Great customer service.", "Date": "February 13, 2014"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": null, "Features": null, "Name": null, "ImgURL": null, "ProductID": "B00EY6AV3W"}}
