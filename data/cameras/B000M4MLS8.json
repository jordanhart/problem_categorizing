The sound is flawless and you can even adjust sound on the camera. The picture...never blurry or anything. The videos play on my 34\" LCD with no fault! I'm totally taking advantage of this feature!The pictures are almost too amazing for me. The camera is a 7.2 megapixel, but I set my picture quality to 5 megapixel because it takes up less space and the pictures turn out beautiful. The image stabilization works really well. I tested it by waving my camera back and forth in the air and randomly took shots without stopping my camera. The weren't the least bit blurry!There are a few modes in this camera:Auto Adjustment (For shooting with preset settings)High Sensitivity (For Low Lighting)Soft Snap (Adds soft background, good for taking pics of people.)Twilight PortraitTwilightLandscapeBeachSnowVideoPrgram Auto (Allows more programming before taking the shot.)Also, you can remove red-eye, crop the photo, and do a bunch of other editing right on the camera!The lens is without flaw. I don't even need flash on my shots because the lens can take in enough light.You can play slideshows on your camera WITH MUSIC!There's so many things I like about this camera, I can't list them all. I love it so much. If you get this camera, you will not have regrets. It's only $230 max and worth the price. I have the pink one, but it comes in pink, silver, white, and black.Also, it looks bulky in pictures but it is really small. A little thicker than a casio but less length and width.Also, don't buy a camera that doesn't have a viewfinder. I was outside in the sun today and I couldn't see my screen! I love that this camera has a viewfinder!The Only Cons:*The battery takes 4.5 hours to charge (but it lasts a long time on full charge)*Sony uses memory stick PRO DUO instead of SD cards, but Circuit City has a deal that when you buy this camera, you get a free 1GB card (which is all you need.)I would reccomend this to anyone...it is really user friendly. Each setting you put it on show a description of what it is.

After several weeks I find that I use it more than she does, because of the ease of operatin and portability.  I love my Canon Rebel XTi, bt this Sony does 90% of what the Canon is capable of.  The macro feature is even better than the Canon.  At 7.2 mp, my enlargements are crisp and true to color.  Yes, I would like to charge the camera battery while attached to the computer, but the battery life is extremely long, with the small Li-ion battery. The included charger is a bit slow, but I did find an after-market charger online that is faster.A feature that I really enjoy is the slide show mode, with music and HD quality. Nice touch! I've owned many Sony products over the years, from an early 9\" portable B/W TV, a Walkman, through a plasma TV, and have never been disappointed in the quality and features.  Bravo Sony for another fine product!!", "Date": "May 12, 2007"}, {"Title": "Great for the price", "Author": "jeremy", "ReviewID": "R3N7JMM1R3I7Z1", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This is a great camera for its price. This might be the best choice for its class because it provides IS (image stabilization for  shaky hands and moving objects:anti blur), 2.5 inch lcd, 7.2 megapixels and 3x optical zoom for under $235. You can find different cameras with IS and with more pixels or zoom capabilities but you should also compare their price with this one. I researched alot before buying this camera and could not find any camera with IS under $300 (brand new, not used). Morover, this is very handy, tiny and light that you can carry in your pocket without feeling it. There are cameras out there with 10x optical zooms but you have to hire someone to carry it for you:) I will always prefer a tiny camera over a bulky one because those bulky ones are usually loaded with features that you will never need or use. Additionally, those bulky cameras are also much more expensive. You would end up paying high prices for features that you will never use.I recommend you to buy at least 2gb of memory from e-bay.Buy from someone with high feedback score. I purchased a 2gb \"high speed memory stick pro duo\" for $20 (incl shipping) from e-bay. As time passes, as in every technological toy,  you will be able to find cheaper and better.Menus and settings are very easy and clear. Information about the current settings appear on the lcd when you switch or push buttons for example when you switch mode dial to moon (one of the symbols on the dial) \"Shoot low light scene without flash\" explanation appears on the lcd for about 2 seconds which is very helpful.I wish you could have been able to charge the battery while its in the camera but you cannot. You need to carry the included charger if you are travelling. Carrying a cable for charging instead of a seperate charger would be better.However, battery life is very satisfying and better than its competitors.One of my disappointments about the camera (actually it is not a big deal) is you need to press too many buttons to delete an image. This is only case for deleting an image. Other menu shortcuts are great; however, I wish it had also a shortcut or a button for deleting since this is a digital camera and the great thing about these cameras is the ability to erase easily. My previous camera (Dsc-v1) had a button for erasig images on the menu buttons which was very easy and helpful. But with this camera, I had to press 5 times (on different buttons) before I can delete the last image taken.Overall, this is a very great camera for the price and features. One of the most important adventage is its IS (Image stabilization) feature. One of the best alternative for this camera is Canon PowerShot SD800 IS 7.1MP, in case you do not like DSC-W80, which you can buy around $300. Since I purchased Dsc-w80 for $230, I recommend sony over canon.", "Date": "May 7, 2007"}, {"Title": "4th digital Camera", "Author": "PhiloX \"PhiloX\"", "ReviewID": "R29O42075OG7IH", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I was a professional wedding photographer using medium format 120 film cameras. It was a good thing I retired before the digital takeover. The speed of technological improvements both in cameras & computer programs would of broke my bank account. Happily there were & are some good priced consumer digital cameras made for the budget minded.The 1st digital camera we bought around the turn of the century was the Cannon GS-1 3MP for appox $1000. Even in today standards the camera was easier & faster than the present Sony's because it had an easy set-up & user friendly format. Sadly the camera was dropped while visiting Hearst Castle in August 2004 & stopped working a few weeks later.After this we decided to buy a semi-professional digital camera & chose the Sony DSC-F826 8MP which has a manual Zeiss 7X zoom lens. The camera is multi functional with infrared night vision & can take after market over head flash units, but it is rather slow in auto focus mode & the format wasn't as easy as the Cannon, too many dials and buttons all over the place. The Sony DSC-F826 takes both CF cards & Sony Memory Sticks. Price was appox $1000 in 2004.Then my wife needed a smaller digital camera that had to use AA batteries for Eastern European visits so that we could buy batteries anywhere. We bought the Sony Cybershot DSC-W7 7.2MP for appox $400 in 2005. The camera was on sale because most people didn't want an AA battery powered camera. It has a similar format like the Sony DSC-F826 but simplified only because it has less functions. On the back of the camera is a large, bright, & fantastic LSD screen, but again was slow at shooting in auto focus mode.We bought the Sony Cybershot DSCW80 7.2MP because the speed of shooting in auto focus mode improved & the close up function was amazing, no need of a close up focus lens. You can walk up to any subject, no mater what size, & take the picture. The camera is also half the width of the Sony DSC-W7 & has an ISO rating of 3200 with face detection. Hopefully the advertised long life NP-BG-1 battery won't be an issue in Eastern Europe & we are thinking of giving the Sony DSC-W7 to our Russian relations if the battery life is as promised. If you had Sony digital cameras before, the Sony DSCW80 functions are similar but are no longer mainly in a top dial, but are instead contained in a \"HOME\" button. When you want to review, you must go to \"HOME\" then go to \"View Images\" rather than turning the dial as in pervious cameras. There is also an image review button by the main dial. Great price for the functions & ease, & the Sony Memory Sticks for this model are twice in memory & half in size & price.Report from vacation: the battery lasted up to 328 shots, very close to the promised listed spec of 340. Camera was set at 5MP & about 10 to 15 pictures were shot with flash at night. Good thing we bought an extra battery because the USA to European transformer dual pins didn't fit the wall sockets in Ukraine. Got great pictures & am very pleased.Comment from reading other current reviews: Some users of this camera state that they are getting blurry pictures when taking action shoots. I am not a sports photographer therefore I don't have much need for super fast capture, but out of the 400 pictures from our vacation we maybe got around 30 blurry pictures for 2 main reasons:1. The camera took great pictures when at full power, it even capture people diving into a lake without a blur, but when the battery got low during some outside night pictures is when we started noticing some problems: the people were frozen by the flash but the background showed movement. I still liked the pictures with the pan effect. The camera was set on \"Auto\" mode & should of been switch to the \"Twilight\" mode.2. Later someone somewhere switched the camera to \"Soft Focus\" mode & a few pictures lacked detail.My conclusion is that the camera must be kept at a certain power ratio with the battery. Once the pictures become blurry, change or recharge the battery. Remember I was in Eastern Europe & our battery transformer pins didn't fit the wall sockets so there was no way to recharge the battery each day. I went all the way down in battery power before changing to another battery. Not the best way to go. If at night, change the camera mode to \"Twilight\" or \"High Sensitivity\" or put the camera on a tri-pod. Also check the \"Soft Focus\" switch, it may have been turn on by mistake.", "Date": "June 9, 2007"}, {"Title": "Surprising Sony", "Author": "spin_nin", "ReviewID": "R17GI4QK43X8OU", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "The Sony Cyber-Shot DSCW80 surprised me at first. The \"twilight\" mode yielded some very nice (hand held) low light shots and almost everything I took (indoors and out) looked nice on my computer's screen. When I had prints of some of the photos made the Bionz image processor reared its ugly head. It blurred all the fine details away leaving me with nothing but noisy images. Keep in mind that this was at all ISO's. After that I decided the Sony and I were incompatible. I found the color representation to be inaccurate as well. Not horribly so, just off a bit too much for my liking. While the size of the LCD was good it was easily washed out in outdoor conditions (at least there is an actual optical viewfinder to fall back on but, unfortunately, it is inaccurate).Some good traits are that the image stabilization worked very well and that the battery life was excellent. The continuous shooting mode was very fast. Auto focusing was pretty good. Video mode was surprisingly good but I think that a Memory Stick Pro Duo is necessary. This is easily the smallest and most portable compact camera that I tried. I really liked some of the small details like the metal tripod mount and the location of the door (on the side of the camera) so you can swap out the battery or memory card easily while leaving the camera on the tripod.This truly is a point & shoot camera. It would've been nice if Sony had allowed for some manual controls but, out of all the cameras I tested, it offered the least. To say the menu system is confusing is an understatement. I'm not a big fan of the proprietary Memory Stick Pro Duo that Sony users are stuck with. I'm also wary of the reliability and the customer service associated with this company and their cameras.In the end I just felt that there are better choices out there when considering cameras this price range.", "Date": "November 2, 2007"}, {"Title": "Awesome camera for the price", "Author": "Techie", "ReviewID": "R2A37CIBS0MGGN", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I got this camera as a replacement for a Canon Elph 3 mega Pixel from 2004.  I was always frustrated by the blurry pictures that I took with the Elph no matter what modes I choose.  When it was time to retire the Elph, I went with the Sony based on other Sonys other people have had.  I liked the speed of the shots, the Carl Zeiss len, the large display and the compact size.  The new generation camera also tell you in English what mode you are in which is helpful for us who just want to take pictures and go.  All the shots from the camera have been great even without the anti-blur feature turned on.  My prints are clear and sharp.  There is also a playback feature in the camera that adds music and transitions.  I don't get the 400+ shots per battery charge as stated in the marketing materials but I do use the camera alot to preview what's been taken and to upload shots to my computer.

So, for a newbie like me, this was the perfect digital camera.  It was so easy to learn how to use and my prints are gorgeous!  Even the pictures I took at night with little light came out awesome!  The Image Stabilization is great, because I don't know how to hold a steady hand just yet.  I chose black, because I wanted another camera color besides the usual silver.

For the most part, I was happy with the pictures it took, the ISO is a huge improvement over the last digital camera I owned.Mine had several issues, one of which I'm not sure is common among all of these, and one that is a defect.When the battery dies (and there is very little warning), the shudder remains open, exposing the camera lens to scratches.Within a month and a half of the shipping date of the camera, the zoom stopped working.  Technical support has been outsourced overseas, and I had to spell very common words to the person I spoke with.  It ultimately took 4 phone calls and over 2 hours to be issued authorization to return the camera.A credit will not be issued for 48 hours after the camera is returned, and Sony will only pay for FedEx ground.  They estimate I will have my refund in 12 days.I plan on buying another camera from another company, and feel the wait time is out of line with how other companies deal with faulty merchandise.I don't know overall how good or bad Sony's quality control is, but I know that I will not deal with them as a company again assuming someone else makes a similar product in the same price range.

A little more than I wanted to spend, but if it was a camera that was worth it, I would probably purchase it.I am so impressed with this little camera!

Best price find was WalMart online site ordering. I love that each menu choice shows on screen a brief descriptive of what that function will do.  This was about $100 less than a Canon Powershot sd800 that I was looking at as well.  Couldn't justify the extra $ for only 0.8 more optical zoom, and less manual controls.  I do love the photos I get with Auto settings. Those with larger hands/fingers may have a bit of getting used to the small buttons on back of camera, but I think the price and features are worth the adjustment.  I think my battery life is good, especially if I use card reader ($10-$20+) to download pics to computer rather than using included cables as to not drain battery or wear on camera. I have no problem navigating the menu or with the battery and card door seeming flimsy, as I read in some reviews.I'm not electronics-savy. This has been great for daily family photos so far.  Also huge bonus that Sony kept the optical viewfinder, just incase sun is too bright to see the screen easily, though I haven't had this problem yet.

It also has a burst mode that performed well.My only negative here is the buttons. They are a bit small and I don't like the ergonomics of the buttons - just a little too small.

I am the owner of a Nikon D50 so this review may have a different reference point than others.While DSCW80 lacks the option of manual settings, the auto modes do a decent job (note that the \"manual\" \"P\" mode is only a half-auto mode). In good light the pictures are crisp and clear but in low light conditions the camera performs just average, taking shots with a significant noise level despite the ISO 3200 capability. In fact pictures taken with over ISO 400 settings experience increased noise. This seems to be a problem common to all small cameras sporting small flash and lenses.  If you want good pictures in low light conditions look towards cameras that have big lenses.Get a 2GB flash memory (Memory Stick Pro Duo) and you don't have to worry about running out of space - it should easily fit 600 shots, much more than your battery life... which is very good and offers decent recycle times with flash. Again, no comparison with a DSLR, but nothing to complain about.The movies are just OK, in no way this camera can replace a camcorder. I found the sound to be poor and the picture to be less fluid than desired. Other cameras on the market shoot much better in movie mode. But again, this is a camera, not a camcorder.On the low side this camera needs a proprietary cable (supplied) to connect to the USB port (Sony \"wisdom\").

This is a really neat feature.+ Grid display. This shows a grid on the screen so if you're taking landscapes, it's a lot easier to level your hands so you get a great picture, avoiding any odd crookedness.+ Videos look great+ Viewfinder is useful when taking pictures in the dark (just don't use it when taking macro shots -- it's not even close to what the lens will capture)+ Continuous Shot mode (aka Burst mode)Cons [-]- Directional buttons are hard to press at times- Uses proprietary memory sticks (MS Pro Duo) which is generally more expensive than an SD card.- The provided battery charger is unnecessarily slow (over three hours to fully charge). Sony has a faster charger out there, but don't expect to find it for less than $45- Not really a con in my book because I don't notice, but the LCD screen is only 115,000 pixels whereas the competitors (Canon, Nikon, etc) have 260,000 pixels. It really does not matter because 115,000 is more than efficient to view pictures. Once it's on your computer, it doesn't make a difference on what a camera screen shows.That being said, I truly enjoy using this camera and my friends are very envious.

I enjoyed the in-cam cropping until I realized that the cropped photo is the same size as the original. Doesn't quite make sense.At first I was a tad annoyed that there was no dedicated 'delete' button, but I quickly got over that with the 'multiple picture delete' feature, which speeds things up in the long run.I like the fact that it has a separate viewfinder, which is a feature that needs to be in more digital cameras now. It's not always appropriate to look at a LCD screen in bright light.One absolutely useless feature is the High ISO setting. The pictures look horribly grainy, but this isn't either a spy camera or a digital 12 megapixel SLR and the flash works wonderfully.The lack of a true high ISO setting is offset with the 'Twilight Portrait' mode, which takes a flash picture while keeping the shutter open for a second afterwards. This can bring out dark backgrounds for proper exposures or allows you to make cool 'artsy' photos where the person or object is prominently in focus while there's blur all around.The steady shot feature really does work well. The optical zoom is only 3x, but I bought this for convenient, everyday use. The display is splendid and very resistant to scratches.Overall, this is a very good party cam. It's small, the screen is bright and big, the very basic settings are super easy to understand & tweak and, most importantly, the pictures come out well.", "Date": "December 12, 2007"}, {"Title": "Nice in looks, average on performance", "Author": "DL \"DL\"", "ReviewID": "R2CKO9ATF8M7DY", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "The camera offers the latest in design and weight, but I had hoped more from it, especially since I was upgrading myself from by \"archaic\" Cybershot P72 (3.2 mp), which by the way, is still serving me well.

The only two really irritating things about the camera are that the power button is located too close to the shutter button and then sometimes I turn the camera off instead of taking a photo.  The other is that during movies, if there is a lot of white glare somewhere, pink stripes will show up all across that area.  I didn't read anyone else having this problem in other reviews, so I'm not sure if it's a \"normal\" problem or not.

We wanted a smaller camera with the verstility to capture all of the excitement of such a trip.  We left plenty of time to develop a feel for the new features and options that this model had over our older Olympus model.  We mostly point and shoot, but hoped to have the versatility to customize shots when we had the time and calling to do so.  Although we're not a shutterbugs, my wife and I are not Techno-dunces either, (we are engineers with plenty of camera, microscope, and endoscopic experience).  In part, we based our decision to buy this camera upon the favorable recomendations of a leading consumer reporting magazine.I must agree with several other reviewers that this camera produces pictures that lack clarity and focus.  It works best outdoors when shooting with a lot of natural light.  Even then, action shots are always blurred - even when employing the faster shutter speeds available via selectable pre-programmed exposure modes.  When the light begins to dim - pictures get progressively more grainy, blurred, and frustrating.I was convinced that operator error was the main cause of our problems, but I have now passed the camera around at enough soccer games and basketball games to ensure this is not the case.  I have read and re-read the users manual and found that nothing seems to help.I hate to sound overly critical of SONY, but I would also add that the software that came with the camera was quite cumbersome.  It took a long time to load and causes operating system errors with my IBM Laptop.In simple summary, I would not recommend this camera to anyone.  You can only imagine the frustration of having 400 images from a Disney vacation of which only 100 are worth printing.  Many of the candid shots that would have been most memorable - on rides, at parades, during shows - have the worst clarity.This camera was not the right choice.

First off, in low light situations, especially without the flash, the images will get really grainy.  My understanding is that this is because to make these cameras so small, the photosensor is very small as well, which means it won't work as well in a low light environment, if this concerns you, step up to a slightly large point and shoot digital camera, it won't be pocket sized, but you'll get better low light images.I was able to get great photo's and videos of my nieces birth with a 1gb memory stick installed, but I did notice the low light issue, again, that's the trade off for a camera this small, so I can live with it.

I had a DSC-P52, and once that died, I got a DSC-W50. I was really pleased with that camera, but it was missing one thing that I really wanted--image stabilization. I picked up the W80 because it had just that, and 7.2 megapixels compared to the W50's 6.0.Unfortunately, I wasn't as happy with this camera as my previous purchase. First of all, the interface, while more attractive, is clumsy in comparison to previous iterations. If you're used to this interface on other sony products (PSP, PS3, for instance) then this won't be too much of an issue. Likewise if this is your first Cyber-Shot purchase. However, if you're like me, and have grown accustomed to the old interface, this one feels a bit clumsy.That aside, the feature that I purchased this for--image stabilization--works very well. However, the internal noise reduction is a little much. While it looks fine once you make prints and on the LCD, if you look at it on your computer at 100% size, you will instantly notice how muddy the pictures look. This was a major turn-off, because I primarily view my photos on my computer, and only occasionally make prints.The macro is also not as good as the W50. The ISO setting on the dial is absolutely useless; it forces an ISO of 3200, which this tiny sensor can't handle. The pictures at that setting are horrid. They won't seem that way on the lcd (most times), but once you get them home, forget it. Sludge city.I sold my W50 to get this, and honestly, I regret it. Also, beware...I was foolish and didn't realize the following point, and it cost me: The image stabilization comes at a cost. The shutter slows a bit as it compensates for motion. This means that if you're trying to take a freehanded photo of a moving object, you're better off WITHOUT the image stabililzation. You may have a clear shot of a landscape or a background, but if there are moving images, you will not get a clear shot, even with ample lighting. I took some shots at a concert with image stabilization on, and they were awful. I took other shots at the same venue with my older camera, and they were perfect. The older camera with a steady hand and no stabilization came out better.Also, features like face detection are limited to the auto and soft snap presets. If you set it to ANY other setting, you can't get this option. I think that's beyond ridiculous. If you offer such a useful setting, don't cripple it by limiting it to two modes, and not even include it in the Program mode.It's a tolerable camera, but it could've been much better, and I was much happier with the previous wave of W-series cameras.", "Date": "January 4, 2008"}, {"Title": "Good snapshot digital.", "Author": "Randall A.

This camera does that!  I also own two Nikon D70's and am fairly picky where any camera comes in.  The reviews that I read on this camera from CNET and othr photo oriented forums were not giving it great image reviews and I wondered if it was a good choice. What really sells this machine is the HD viewing .If you already own an HD tv, the images displayed through the built in slide show are WOW! The slide show feature allows you to put your own favorite music to the show or use the included music.  I have not added my own yet, however the included is just fine. I have found that the reviews are accurate in regards to resolution as anything photographed over 200 ISO has noise reduction artifacts included.  This could be a problem for some as most people do not use flash all of the time and depend highly on a higher ISO to get their photos.  I shoot with this camera at 100 ISO and use flash indoors with everything.  Doing this cuts down on the amount of photos you will get on a battery charge, to around 170, about half of the photos you would achieve if no flash is used.  The re-charge cycle is quite long, about four hours to fully charged.  I would certainly recommend a second battery for travelers just in case flash is important to them.  The movie feature does a very nice job for mpeg 1.  I had hoped that I could put the short movie directly on my ipod, however they need to be converted somehow to mpeg4.  You can do this with the Neuros video recorder and a CD player if your crafty. The camera is quick and reponsive and produces nice, sharp images up to ISO 200.  ISO 400 is the absolute maximum speed to shoot at for enlargements.  The face detection feature is just ok, but faster and more accurate than any of the other point and shoots that I looked at, including Canon and Nikon. I suspect that Sony made compromises with this camera in order to move to the next level of point and shoots which would be HD viewing. It is, in my opinion, a very good camera for its price range and beats out Nikon and Canon, Olympus, in features, ease of use and reliability.  Kodak would be the only other camera that comes close to features for the cost. On a side note, the HD feature can only be utilized with the additional cable kit from Sony for $30 more.  It is worth it! The photos are stunning displayed in 1080p.Buy this camera if you want something that tucks in a pocket and can shoot nice, clean snappy images up to 8x10, and have a need now and again to make a moview quick on the spot.

Boy was I in for disappointment!My low light shots without flash were all full of artifacts and very grainy.  Not letting this bother me too much since this is hardly an SLR I took several shots with increased ISO.  Still crap.  With flash?  Crap.  Even when sunlight was coming directly through the window and hitting the subject I was photographing the photos were grainy!  Regular outdoor shots left my subject looking soft and slightly out of focus with the surroundings almost completely washed out and over exposed.About the only good thing that I can say about this camera is that it performs beautifully with nearly no shutter lag and quick startup/shutdown times.

It is very easy to use and it can be used in all lighting conditions even if some of the stills in low light are blurry - that's to be expected.  The video quality is not the best, but the sound with the video is very good, so it does well for simple video capture. The battery does drain quickly with video use, however that may be typical of all cameras.  The video works well enough to capture performances on stage in low lights with stage lighting and the sound quality is more than acceptable.You can probably get about 1 hour or a little longer on a full battery charge.Having used Sony lithium batteries for a few years now and sampled AA battery cameras, I could NEVER use any other type of battery system. (though I have to say that my Olympus camera has a NimH mode that adds to the AA use time considerably)  I LOVE the long length of battery use.  This camera captures images quickly, but I do see some recovery time is needed - so there is some lag time primarily with flash photography.  The facial recognition technology works well.I will add more to this review, but overall this camera has been a very good buy, and after repeated use, still works flawlessly.This camera and the wonderful free program Picasa 3 from Google are all you need to get started.  Next on my list is a longer zoom camera, but this will do for now.We also have the Sony DSC-W120 with 4x optical zoom and Smile Detection Technology.Both cameras are fairly comparable with the exception of the zoom length and smile detection.Update 06/20/2011 (sorry for any repetition):  This camera is still the most reliable camera that I have ever owned.  It continues to work perfectly and it is used almost all the time by either me or my daughter.The standard video mode continues to be a great \"whip out the camera and take a video\" mode.  In low lighting such as on stage at fairly close distances, it captures movement well, but faces are blurred unless of course you set the zoom at a closeup length before you begin videotaping. I have not tried the high quality video mode. I was afraid that I would run out of recording time, but I will do so and update this review. The image stablizer works fairly well to minimize \"hand shake\" but any shakiness is probably more apparent when the zoom lens is utilized.  The sound quality is amazing - as good as you can ask from a small camera.  This a great camera to turn to for all of your projects - self portraits with the self-timer (as my daughter will attest), video indoors and out in natural light, indoor light and variable/low light conditions (when the stage is light but the background is dark), portraits, close ups, landscapes, pet photography, etc.  The color and image quality are very good.  I don't use the red eye reduction (I probably should sometimes!), so I have to use photo correction software (such as the free program Picasa 3 or CVS's software for ordering prints).  I just love this camera and the comparable DSC-W120!  They both feature Carl Zeiss  Vario-Tessar lenses and they are so easy to stow in your pocket or purse. Get one and make every day an adventure!Here's some info from the Sony DSC-W80 menu display using brand new Sandisk 8GB Memory Stick PRO Duo Card:Fine Video Mode:  approx. 1 hr. 41 min.

Please refer to my review for Sony DSC-W120 for some additional information since both cameras are fairly comparable except for a few distinctions.  Personally I like the menu options on the DSC-W80 a little better, but it's easy to get used to either camera.  I am going to add some images.  I use both the 80 and 120 models interchangeably, but I will provide some images from the 80.I purchased this camera (silver) in a kit with a docking station for viewing stills and videos in HD on a television for about $120 at Sears on clearance a number of years ago.  I haven't used the docking station much, but it was a great price for a combo package.  The camera is in brand new, mint condition after several years of use with no mechanical problems whatsoever.  Actually the DSC-W80 has a little \"crisper\" menu response - maybe because my daughter has used the DSC-W120 in tougher conditions.We also bought the pink Sony DSC-W120 at Sears and it came with a camera case and a pink card reader - also for a very good price.  We've had good luck finding good deals on cameras at Sears.Right now we are considering adding a Kodak Z990 (offered by Amazon at best price) to our camera lineup.  This Kodak camera takes Ni-mH rechargeable batteries, so I hope that I won't be disappointed in the battery life.Hope this helps!

The cord used to attach the camera to a USB port is unusual - ie not a mini USB port - the cord itself is cumbersome to carry around. I've relied mostly on the availability of card readers for my sharing. The video and audio quality is good for a personal camera.I feel like the button dial is easy to understand and the settings are easy to manipulate. I received a gorilla tripod as a gift which is compatible, attaches easily, and is very convenient for the auto timer setting.  It has a viewing window which I have never used as its digital and the program will pop up a square around individual faces to help center the photos. The flash is easy to turn off and on, along with the red eye reduction. The zoom is straightforward with great quality - the tripod is useful when at the 3x zoom for the steady shot. Photos tend to be blurry and out of focus when in zoom and not rested on something solid.My husband and I have utilized the camera for the token arms length photos and the auto timer photos. It has been used and abused - thrown into suite cases checked at the airport, the bottom of my purse without a case, fits nicely into blue jeans butt pocket, its survived a few drops onto hard surfaces. The battery life is the thing that I have to rave about. Having had cameras with AA batteries - I will never go back. Yes the battery is a little pricey in comparison - but it holds a charge for a while and after replacing the AA's a few times and investing in the rechargeable type.... Maybe its the fact that the camera turns itself off after a few minutes if it's idle - either way, I have been very impressed with the longevity of the lithium rechargeable I purchased with the camera. Having just returned from Europe where we forgot to pack the battery charger,  I can report that our 2.5 week trip - taking pictures literally every day at various places through out the day an night - the battery never died on us.

I needed a replacement quickly so I didn't do any research or read online reviews.  (I had owned 2 previous Sony cameras, so I was confident I would get a good product.)  I was a little skeptical about the smaller compact size, but on the first day I owned it I walked outside and took a few shots of my landscape (very colorful, as I have lots of flowers) and I was pleased.  Kept it the rest of the summer, taking mostly outdoor (poolside & landscape shots).  I also fell in love with it's small size, making it a dream to carry in a pocket or purse.  I found a small zipper cover at Staples that fits it's perfectly (for only $10, compared to Sony's $40 soft-case).  It wasn't until we had a family gathering in the fall that I realized the down-side of this camera.  Most of the indoor pictures are grainy & just not very crisp.  The camera struggles in lower light conditions, even in a moderately lit room.  If a flash is used, faces look white & washed out and eyes are always red.  Of course, editing eyes is always an option, but this gets old when you have to edit every single indoor photo you take.  However, I'm still a fan of Sony cameras, so I'm trading this one for a more expensive model.  I'm hoping the DSC-H10 or H50 will make he a happier camper!

She has been using a Nikon Coolpix 8700 that she's very pleased with, but wanted something pocketable.  She has some balance issues, so the \"Steady Shot\" image stabilization was attractive.  After reading reviews in a leading consumer publication, she bought the DSC-W80.Positives: Outdoors, it does very well.  Colors are warm and true.  The image stabilization works well (I have a mild hand tremor, so I'm a good tester...) Sharpness is acceptable.Negatives:  Indoors, not so hot.  As has been posted elswhere, when the camera is faced with dim illumination, the in-camera processing creates a lot of noise, which obliterates most detail in the images.  The flash is feeble, and somewhat slow to fire.  It commonly produces a \"hot spot\" in the center of the image, rather than even lighting.  The menu system is much less intuitive than on the Nikons we both have, or on some of the Canons I've been looking at.  One of the strangest things I have run into is that you can set the size of the captured file (i.e. number of MP), but not the display resolution.  For example, a 7MP image comes up on screen as a 72 px/inch, 42.67 X 32 inch image.  If you bring that image up on screen in Photoshop, and zoom in to 100%, you're looking at an oddly pixelated image for what should be your highest quality setting.  The only cure I've found for on-screen viewing is to run it through Photoshop and resize it both by size and by pixels/inch.  Now maybe that's just a Sony oddity that has only stymied me, but I thought it was worth putting out there.

A lot of the pictures come out blurry and you have to spend a lot of time adjusting the settings to figure out how to get a good picture.

This one and a Nikon D40x. I read the reviews of the Nikon and determined it would be good for taking high quality photos without a flash and/or with manual focus for technical purposes. As for this little camera, I had used a similar (older) Sony camera for technical purposes but was not so impressed with it at times that I couldn't afford to use the flash.Happily, I have found that this one serves nearly all purposes better than expected. Only in rare cases do I need to resort to the D40x (which doesn't have as good a macro mode for my technical purposes). I often take pictures of circuit boards and other small parts. I have found that this camera, in macro mode (the little flower icon) can take pictures as close as about 2.25\" and render excellent images. This is pretty nice. I can use it to take pictures of very fine details - so much so that I can take pictures of some parts (eg. IC's) and reveal their markings clearer than I can see with an ordinary magnifying glass - - - that's right - I sometimes use it as a precision magnifying glass!I have been happy with the camera in most circumstances. However, there are two things it does not excel at:1) Low light photos (dimly lit rooms or dusk and later outside) are not very good; that is, you have to resort to a flash to get these pictures.2) The movie mode, while it is incredibly handy (this camera fits in the pocket really easily), has an odd frame rate by default. I only recently found out that it can be set to 30 frames per second. Even so it suffers from the low light problem (can't supplement movies with a flash!) and it doesn't allow for zooming while in movie mode. I wouldn't buy the camera to replace a real video camera - but as a handy camcorder in a pinch it will do.I guess I should go back to that \"incredibly handy\" line. This is a bigger feature than the new photographer might realize. No camera, no matter how costly, can capture that great scene you are witnessing if it is not with you and ready to go. (My old photography mentor used to say \"if it doesn't have film in it\".) So the size of this camera, the fact that it is rugged enough to be in a pocket without breaking (though I am not as rough as some might be), its good battery life and the ability to have spacious memory cards means that it is very, very easy to have it with you at any critical moment. And it powers up and shoots with a reasonably short delay - meaning you really can capture most of those great scenes. This makes it an EXCELLENT camera.

This is my third Sony digital camera, and I have never been disappointed with any of them. If you're an amatuer photographer, just looking for something to take pictures for the web, or you want to get good family shots, this is a fantastic little workhorse at a price that will fit almost any budget.My biggest reason for loving this camera is the double anti-blur technology. The drawback of these newer, lighter cameras is that they are more diffcult to hold steady, and I have always had trouble getting a good, clear shot without shaking a bit anyway. How many times have you taken a dozen shots of the same thing in the hopes of getting one decent, clear picture? You'll never have to take more than one shot again with this camera-- you get crystal clear results *every single time*, even if you purposely wave it around. The 7.1 megapixel images are MORE than plenty to get great printed images (and the video is nothing to sneeze at either!).Don't be thrown off by images of the camera itself. It's actually very small and lightweight. The battery lasts a long time, but takes a long time to charge (one of my only complaints), and you can get a single memory stick PRO duo in a 1 or 2 gig size at a low price, which will hold LOTS of pictures. I do wish it took a standard SD card. That, and the long battery charging time make this a four star product instead of five for me.If you're shopping for a digital camera, this is a great choice even though it's been out for at least over a year.

When I take pictures using the viewfinder, the pictures come out crooked.  I've experimented with hundreds of pictures.  When I square images in the viewfinder, the pictures always seem as if they dip a little to the left.  When I deliberately offset images in the viewfinder to compensate for the dip, the images are corrected.  So, when using the viewfinder, I have to always shoot images cockeyed in order to capture them correctly.When I use the screen to frame images, I get slightly better results.  However, I have to use the gridline feature, and I have to match the gridlines with something straight (such as a distant building or the horizon).  Using this method, it takes me much longer to snap a picture.I thought I was just imagining things until I asked a few friends to try the camera.  They definitely confirmed that something weird was going on.  They claim that the viewfinder has a kind of fishbowl effect, which makes it hard to frame images.Overall, I find the camera easy to use.

I bought this Sony Cybershot DSC W80 a year and half ago after reading all the good reviews. To my disappointment, it suddenly stopped working a month ago. For unknown reasons, after it was turned on, it would not allow any bottons to function. I checked for repair - will cost over $100 by Sony! I could not believe a camera should stop working in such a short time!!! All my other 6 cameras are working fine, the oldest is a Nikon I bought in 1981. I will never buy a Sony camera again.

Aldrich \"Randy A\"", "ReviewID": "R24XRVF3XV24JI", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "This is the 3rd Sony camera I've purchased (P93, H5, W80), but IT WILL BE THE LAST.I bought this Camera approximately 1 week before my wedding to carry with us on our honeymoon.  We were gone for 2 weeks and a week after we got back I started to notice Dust behind the glass over the rear LCD panel.  I carried the camera in my pocket every day for approximately one month and I was seeing dust.I called Sony who instructed me to take it back to BestBuy (where I made the purchase).  I did so and they sent it out to get repaired.  When I got it back it looked great, for about 2 months...I then called again and explained that there must obviously be a defect as this is the second time within the first few months of owning the camera.  They said they'd gladly take a look at it but they couldn't do anything such as exchange it for another one, or give me credit to buy a different model without looking at it first.  This made perfect sense to me so I sent it off.A few weeks later I get a phone call from the repair facility explaining that they can't do anything because they are a \"complete repair facility\" and there is a minor dent in the top of the camera.  I'm aware of the dent but it's microscopic.  I have no clue how it even got there and I even get them to admit it has no affect on the camera whatsoever.  Still no luck and they wanted $135 to repair it.  NO THANKS!When I got the camera back I cleaned it myself using a microfiber cloth and an eye glass repair kit since they wouldn't even do that.  I have pictures of the process and intend on writing up a how-to guide on my blog.  This all happened about 6 months ago.  Since then it's been relatively fine until about 2 weeks ago when the memory card/battery door broke off.This camera has easily been THE WORST I've owned.  I wish I had pictures available of the amount of dust I found inside once I decided to operate myself.I would like to say, when there was no dust inside the camera took phenomenal quality pictures for a compact, despite the lack of manual controls.I would NEVER RECOMMEND this camera to anyone.

Quick summary the new W line offers some improved performance, lighter pictures (better flash performance) compared to the previous darker cybershots cameras. However in this new W line. The menu system is NOT simple but more complex and in addition Sony removed the battery time remaing!!! Pffft, that does the user alot of good. Again Sony's greed shows prompting the user to get a faster charger and buying an additional battery becuase the user can not rely and guess the time remaining. I will give this camera a try if picture quality is anything like the negative reviews I will return and settle with the tried and proven W55.
