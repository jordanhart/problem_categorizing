It comewith 1000GB hard drive, which is excellent. Most other DVR come with 1500GB hard drive. My original purpose is to view video remotely over the internet, so I can watch my baby and the nanny. The unit was received fast. But the setup took some times. Connectin the cameras to the DVR was easy. But the remote access setup was tough. I contacted seller and they provided the link to download the software. Finally, I can watch the images from my cell phone. This is a great feature.", "Date": "January 30, 2013"}, {"Title": "Sucks", "Author": "Bullfrog77", "ReviewID": "R32Z2V2A5EB3UU", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "Broke after 2 months, and didn't realize it.
