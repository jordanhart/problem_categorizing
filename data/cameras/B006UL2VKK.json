If you are looking for an all-around camera, this is not it (Get a GH1 or GH2).  If you try to use it as an all around camera you will hate it.  If you don't have a good fast camera already then this camera is probably not for you.  If you are trying to take pictures of moving objects, this camera is probably not for you.  This camera takes a fair amount of time to set up a shot so any fast moving subject will be very difficult to capture properly.  This camera is in no way a beginners camera.  If you are looking to just point and shoot, then you will need to look elsewhere.If you like to take your time to frame and set the exposure on your camera then this might be the camera for you.  If you want a small portable camera, with exceptional picture quality, great noise qualities, and a built in view finder, then this is most likely the camera for you.  If you want an exceptionally quite camera, this one is amazing.  There really is no other digital camera like it.This camera reminds me mostly of shooting my Leica M8 and that is a good thing.  If you think of the X100 as an automatic manual focus you can get some really nice shots.I initially bought the X100 to shoot outdoor portraits and it does that very well.  Better than any other camera around right now.  That was the initial reason I decided to keep the X100.  When I first shot with it I really did not like the handling and was thinking of returning it.  My big mistake was trying to use this as an all around camera when it is not.However, I just spent a week shooting the camera in Berlin and I really enjoyed using it.  My kit was a GH1, GH2, and X100.  I left all of my Nikons at home as they are too big and heavy.  With interchangeable lenses and fast handling the GH cameras can cover almost every conceivable shooting situation.  With a fixed lens and slow handling the X100 is limited in what it can cover.  However, it makes you slow down and really set up the shot the way you want it.  The DSLRS and M4/3 are so fast that it is easy to reel off a number of good shots.  The X100 makes you savor each shot.  Because of that I really enjoyed shooting it.  Just as a comparison I shot 750 (2 battery charges) with the X100. And 1300 frames with the GH2.  I had 465 - X100 (62%) and 829 - GH2 (64%) shots that I liked.  I got 132 - X100 (18%) and 205 - GH2(16%) shots that I really liked.  And I got 4 - X100 (.5%) and 9 - GH2 (.7%) that were my favorite of the trip.  As you can see the statistics are very comparable. Use a tool in the way it was designed and you should be able to get consistent results.The X100 fits very nicely in the Lowa Rezo 60 bag that I loop through my belt.  It will also fit in a jacket pocket.  I don't like carrying the weight around my I neck so I do not use a neck strap.  Instead I purchased a very cheap wrist strap and use that to keep the camera secure.The way I have the camera setup is as follows:Quick Startup OnOVF power save OffDisplay Option - EVF and Back screenFn Button - 3 Stop ND FilterAuto ISO - 3200 / 1/30The reason I have the camera setup like this is as follows.  I switch the camera off to save power when not in use.  The quick startup allows for a .7 start.  I use the EVF most of the time so I don't need the OVF power save on.  Also, the OVF power save option does some weird things so I don't use it.  I use the EVF and back display to switch depending on how I want to frame the shot either back screen or EVF.  The camera switches between the two based on whether you put your eye up to the viewfinder or not.  The 1/1000 max shutter speed is very limiting at f2 so the ND filter gives a 1/8000 equivalent and is built right in but is activated in the menus.  I use it very regularly so I have it set to the fn key.  I have the ISO set to auto because it is a pain to get to.  The camera does a very good job of keeping ISO down until the shutter speed starts to drop below 1/30.  The IQ is very good at ISO3200.Here are a couple of techniques for using the X100.  Both utilize EVF.1)  Set your camera to manual focus and spot focusing.  Put the focus square on the subject.  Press the focus/exposure lock button to focus the camera.  Move the center to where you want to meter and press the shutter release half way to set exposure.  Now frame for the picture and shoot.2)  Set you camera to auto focus S.  Put the focus square on the subject.  Press the shutter release half way to set focus and exposure.  Frame the picture and press the shutter release the rest of the way to shoot.On the down side the menus and buttons need some work but they can be fixed with a firmware update.  An example of the poor menus deals with ISO.  Setting the ISO is on the shooting menu.  Setting up the Auto ISO and switching it on and off is on the setup menu.  What is labeled as a RAW button would have been much more useful as an ISO button.  I have not tried the video as it is a pain to get to buried in the menus and not as a distinct button.One of the big selling items is the Hybrid Optical/EVF systems.  I did not purchase this camera because of this.  However, I leave the camera in EVF most of the time.  The EVF shows you what the sensor sees and thus allows for accurate framing.  The OVF is a guestimate and at close distances is not a very good guess.  Therefore, the Hybrid system is overhyped.  If Fuji had just put in a EVF I would have been happy.  For those who must be able to see outside the frame and who are not bothered by a poorly framed photo then the OVF is a choice.  The other issue with OVF deals with focus.  The X100 is a spot focus camera.  You can move the spot but it still focuses on one spot.  That spot does not necessarily line up with what you see in the OVF.  Therefore, you can get some out of focus shots when you think you have everything lined up.A lot has been made of the X100 price tag.  One thing to note is there have been some people paying 2x the price on ebay.  There is no real competitor to the X100 as it is unique.  However, the Leica X1 with OVF and Ricoh GXR with 24mm and OVF are close.  The X1 with OVF costs 2x as much.  The GXR with 28mm and OVF costs about the a couple of hundred dollars more but is a little pieced together, still has no EVF option and is not on par with the X100 build quality.  Also, cameras invariably come down in price so you can expect for the X100 to come down some.On the whole the camera is very rewarding to use and takes some fantastic photographs.  But you are going to have to work for it.  Maybe that is why you take more ownership in your photos  Because of the high ISO capabilities and extreme quite abilities, this is a great museum camera.  For a fixed lens camera, the 35mm equivalent is a good compromise walk around focal length around.  Not too wide that you can't use it for portraits and not so narrow that you have to back up to get in wide items.Pros:UniqueGreat Build QualityAmazing Photos - weak AA filterGreat High ISO on par with D7000 or K5Deafeningly QuietLightSmall (Fits in a jacket pocket)Great Satisfaction in Shooting Great PicturesCons:SlowHorrible Menus which you are forced to use because of the lack of dedicated buttons or quick menu system.Manual Focus Almost WorthlessBack Rotating Knob Button Annoying and Frustrating to useRAW button is a waste and would have been much better as a ISO or fn buttonOverall this is a very satisfying and rewarding camera which makes great pictures.  The camera is 4 stars because of the poor menu system and controls.  However, the intangible reward you get from using this satisfying camera make it greater than the whole and give an extra .5 point for total of 4.5 stars.Update July 9I have been shooting with this camera for a little over 2 months now.  It is definitely an amazing camera.  The firmware update made the camera more useable and the optical view finder is now actually usable.  There still needs to be further improvement but it was a definitive move in the right direction.Something else I have discovered is the Auto White Balance is amazing.  It is by far the best in the world.  I was shooting at night with all sorts of crazy lights, incandescent, sodium vapor, moon, etc.  The auto white balance pulled off the shot.  Amazing.  During the day the white balance is equally terrific.  Additionally, while the autofocus was slow, ISO 1600 and F2 allowed me to catch night shots of slowly moving objects and keep up the shutter speed at 1/30.  The results were fantastic.  The camera would not always lock focus but it allowed me to take the picture and more often than not the picture was in focus.Still not a beginners camera nor an all around camera, this camera has some amazing capabilities that no other camera can match.", "Date": "May 23, 2011"}, {"Title": "Get used to it. It's worth it. IQ will make you tremble.", "Author": "Zentech", "ReviewID": "R80CBRBZC71NR", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "First, a little about me and why I chose this camera.I've been a street shooter for 34 years. Went to SVA and studied with Lisette Model at the New School.Worked as a custom printer and assistant for many photographers in NYC and printed for Modernage andBerkey K&L....; which is a long way to say, I know film.I have owned several digital cameras and still shoot 120 film with a Yashica.I read everything there was to read about the X100. Last year a week after it was announced I started selling myLumix GF1, EVF and lenses. The Lumix was just not intuitive for me as a street shooter. I also felt likeI was going to break it. Shooting with Nikon F2's and F3's one gets used to feeling like you could use itas a weapon if needed. Not so with small plastic feeling cameras.The X100 has the only things I want or need. Shutter, aperture and focus. Give me a decent meter and I'm set.I like the fact that the X100 has done away with the nice but unnecessary Program modes. The controls are real metalknobs. The build quality is like a good film camera. If you hit yourself in the head with it, it's going to hurt.Image quality:You have to see it to believe it. I always liked to shoot RAW but the JPEG quality will blow your doors off.I see no reason to shoot RAW with this camera. The lens is sharp and fast (f2.0). It is matched to the sensor.The image quality will make you weep.Flash:The built in flash does the best fill flash I have ever done. Your mileage may vary but I doubt it. Read thereview of this camera at Ken Rockwell's website.Regarding video:If I wanted to shoot video I would bring a video camera. It's 720p, looks nice but it's not an $80k Ikegami. If I wantto shoot video, my phone does that just swell.The quirks that I had read about:The manual focus is fly by wire and very slow. What can you do? You spend 15 minutes learning how the cameraauto focuses and you use it.Focus is slow, writes to the card are slow, start up time is slow. I didn't find any of these things to the extent that I had read about. If I hadn't read these things, I would not have even thought about them. If you know what you shoot and how you shoot and you actually go out and make lots of images, any camera becomes intuitive. The photographers brain is the most important part of the image flow process.... you learn to use the tool and then you don't have to think about it.Menu structure:It's not a Canon or Nikon or Lumix... it's an X100. Some say the menus are not intuitive and difficult to navigate.You figure it out and use it. After a while you don't have to figure it out.Non-Interchangeable lens:It's a 35mm equivalent. The only 2 lenses that I ever use are 28 and 35mm so once again a non issue for me.Funky filter issue, lens cap and lens shade:Yeah the filter ring thing is kind of stupid but once you do what you need, it's not. I purchased an aftermarketlens shade which was 110.00 less than the Fuji. Makes the camera look more like a Leica but I end up taking it offmost of the time. The lens cap is metal, very high quality and you will lose it. I've read some negativeness about this inexpensive lens hood being loose (JJC from A&R;). So far no problem... and think about it, if it is so tight that when it takes an impact it translates the force right to the lens barrel that's not good either. It should be like a break away mirror on a motorcycle (BMW only I know or owned) meant to hold until the force begins to exceed the point of doing damage to the more expensive parts and then pops off. Anyway..the hood and filter mount are fine unless you are going to be using it as a hammer.Battery life:300-400 exposures. I purchased two after market batteries for 9.00 each. They last as long, are 45.00 cheaper than the Fujibatteries and they haven't set the camera on fire. Hey, when you had to reload after 36 exposures, that was something to bitch about. Only then you didn't know to bitch about it.Battery charger:There is a little plastic piece which holds the battery in place in the charger. Many have complained that it is easy to lose. Two words - Crazy Glue.In conclusion, some people like to talk about their camera. Some like to wear them out. This camera is for the latter.If Eugene Smith were alive, this is the digital camera he would use. If you don't know who Eugene Smith is, shame on you.I have a Nikon D100 that my brother gave me when I had no digital camera at all (He also gave me the Yashica Mat)and the D100 does it's thing very well too. The X100 is just a different tool. These are tools, not jewels. If you want to sit around and talk about your camera and find yourself doing that more than using it, well that's a different kind of tool.One other thing... I purchased the 8 gig Eye-Fi card. It transfers images to the 8 gig sd on my Android phone. It works. Very cool to have a backup made while you are shooting. It will use your battery though.", "Date": "January 20, 2012"}, {"Title": "A review of the X100 by a Nikon dSLR and m4/3 owner", "Author": "LGO \"LG10\"", "ReviewID": "ROYHGWYGGFS90", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I am writing this review from the perspective of someone who owns a Nikon full-frame dSLR (Nikon D700+MB-D10), two Nikon crop dSLR (Nikon D7000+MB-D11 and Nikon D3100) and an m4/3 camera (Panasonic GH2).I receive the Fujifilm X100 about 5 days ago and since then, I have been slowly learning the features and capabilities of this camera.  I will be steadily adding to this review in the coming days but I thought I'd share here my initial impressions of the X100 to help those wondering whether to get this camera make their decision.Though I tried my hand at using small cameras that can shot RAW and provide full manual controls on aperture, shutter speed, ISO and White Balance (the Panasonic LX-3 and the Canon S90 being among these), I was never happy with the marginal photos that I could take with these cameras.  This is mainly due to the small-sized camera sensor.  Yet part of my dis-satisfaction with these cameras is also due to the shooting position where one extends one's arms to view and compose with the rear LCD screen rather than the viewfinder to the eye position when using a dSLR.  After trying my hand with these cameras, I sold them but knew that my next small and light camera must have a large sensor and a proper viewfinder.My initial attempt to finally address this issue on poor image quality and sub-optimal shooting stance yet have a small and compact camera was my purchase of the Nikon D3100 which I paired with a Nikkor 35mm f/1.8G DX lens.  Equipped with a good-sized sensor, a real optical view finder (OVF) and a very capable lens, this setup provided me with a compact, light, inexpensive and very capable camera setup.  I was very happy with the setup and it provided me some relief from using the D700+MB-D10 or D7000+MB-D11 combo.  Though I did install and use my other Nikkor lenses on the D3100, it was the Nikkor 35mm f/1.8G DX that was mounted on the D3100 easily 50% of the time.  For the other times, it was mainly the Nikkor 24mm f/1.4G at 40% of the time and the Nikkor 17-55mm f/2.8 or the Tokina 11-16mm f/2.8 for the remaining 10%.  I would have used the Nikkor 24mm f/1.4G far more often with the D3100 than the Nikkor 35mm f/1.8G DX but the large size and heavy weight of the Nikkor 24mm f/1.4G lens does not make for a light and well-balanced combo with the D3100.  So as much as I would have preferred matching the D3100 with a 24mm focal length prime lens, the lighter weight and smaller size of the 35mm f/1.8G DX made it the default lens for the D3100.I also acquired a Panasonic GH2.  Though equipped with a smaller m4/3 sensor, the GH2 acquits itself very well for video work and the 14-140mm lens provided good results when shooting outdoors or in good lighting conditions.  But for still-photography, the GH2 with the 14-140mm lens is simply awful.  For a while, I had the impression that the GH2 was very bad for still photos until I decided to buy an adapter and mounted my Nikkor prime lenses on the GH2.  Wow .. what a difference mounting good lenses made on the quality of photos the GH2 can take.  I found myself using the GH2 more and more often for still-photos even though I had to manually focus my Nikkor lenses.  The GH2 was my first exposure to an electronic viewfinder (EVF) and despite its real limitations when working in sub-optimally lighted conditions, I appreciated the ability of the EVF of the GH2 to display information that an OVF could not display.  I decided to add a Panasonic 20mm f/1.7 and 14mm f/2.5 lens and was happy with the resulting setup which was even more compact and lighter than my Nikon D3100 and 35mm f/1.8G DX lens.  While the image quality of the Nikon D3100 was still better than the GH2, the smaller lighter size of the GH2 and its excellent video capabilities made it my choice for many situations.Then came the Fujifilm X100.  Combining the small compact size of the GH2 and its compact prime lenses plus incorporating the advantages of both the optical viewfinder of the D3100 and the electronic viewfinder of the GH2, I became seriously interested in the X100.  The fact that the lens was not interchangeable was not an issue for me as the X100 lens is a 23mm f/2.0 - the perfect focal length as far as I was concerned.  The 35mm equivalent of 35mm would have been my favorite focal length with the D3100 and the GH2 but neither Nikon nor Panasonic makes a compact and light prime lens that has a fast 35mm in 35mm equivalent (Olympus makes a m4/3 17mm but it is just f/2.8). That the X100 lens was also a fast f/2.0 lens was definitely an ace in favor of the X100.  While cleaning the sensor of my D700, I realized another reason why the non-interchangeable lens nature of the X100 was a non-issue.  With a non-removable lens, the X100 will likely not need any sensor cleaning at all, I happily realized.  Yes!Viewed sideways, the X100 was considerably smaller and thinner than the D3100 with the 35mm f/1.8GDX lens and still substantially thinner than the GH2 with the 20mm f/1.7 lens.  The X100 wins against the two others on this point.Based on my initial test, the image quality of the X100 is excellent and can easily hold its own against the Nikkor D3100 with the 35mm f/1.8G DX lens.  This is quite an achievement as the Nikon-Nikkor combo is superb.  While the X100 is a bit soft when shot wide-open at f/2.0 compared with the Nikkor D3100 shooting the 35mm f/1.8G DX at f/2.0, I like the way the X100 renders the image which is very pleasing and of a different character than the clinical images I could take with the Nikon D3100 and the 35mm f/1.8G DX lens.  Testing both at f/2.8, f/4.0, f/5.6 and f/8.0 yielded even better results with the X100 while the Nikkor D3100 with the 35mm f/1.8G DX stayed very good as well (it was really good wide-open to begin with anyway).  In terms of image quality, I would rank these two at about equal.What for me tilts the balance in favor of the X100 is the focal length of its lens - 23mm vs the 35mm of the Nikkor.  So while the image quality for both are neck-to-neck, I much prefer the X100 because of its lens' focal length.  The GH2 ranks lower than the X100 and D3100 in image quality and with the X100 being thinner and having both OVF and EVF and with my preferred focal length lens, the X100 is now my first choice for a small and light compact camera.CONTINUATION - April 12, 2011In many respects, while there are similarities among the D3100, GH2 and the Fujifilm X100, each is unique and each serves a specific purpose better than the other.The primary advantage of the D3100 is that it packs a lot of capabilities and flexibility for its size.  These advantages however are lost when one installs a zoom lens on the D3100 as the resulting bulk and weight no longer qualifies it as a light and compact camera.  Until such time that Nikon releases several compact and light prime AF-S lenses that will auto-focus on the D3100, the D3100 steps out of the light-and-compact auto-focusing camera competition when equipped with other than the Nikkor 35mm f/1.8G DX.For video work, the GH2 remains the best tool for the job, with the D3100 and the X100 a far second and third.  In addition to a far superior video capabilities, the GH2 has a electronic zoom that essentially gives the user a 2nd lens when using the pancake prime lens.  Very impressively, this electronic zoom (or \"ETC\" in Panasonic parlance) can be used without any significant or visible degradation in the captured video and provides the GH2 a flexibility that other manufacturers would do well to emulate.  The availability of several good light and very compact interchangeable pancake prime lenses adds further to the attraction of the GH2 as a video camera - as well as a still photography camera.  This makes the GH2 a better tool for those who want to capture still photos and videos at the same time.  The only disadvantage that I see to the GH2 is its low-light performance which is best described as adequate but not exceptional.  This is partly due to its smaller sensor and higher pixel density.  While using fast primes such as the 20mm f/1.7 can often delay the onset of having have to use higher ISO, the GH2 would truly be exceptional if it had better low-light performance and will likely be the toughest hombre to beat among the three.The Fujifilm X100 as a still camera is excellent for a select group of photographers who are not limited by the fixed-lens as its performance as a still camera is nothing short of excellent.  In terms of low-light performance, the Fujifilm X100 outclasses the D3100 when shooting at ISO 3200 and even more so at ISO 6400 where the X100 still yields very good images.  Combine with the f/2.0 lens, the X100 users will likely have minimal need of bringing an external flash.  For a narrower select group of photographers who are not hobbled by the fixed lens, the Fujifilm X100 is one of the most exciting camera in the market.CONTINUATION April 15, 2011Fujifilm's decision to equip the X100 with a fixed non-interchangeable lens has allowed it to make the camera and lens smaller, and to add several features unique to the X100.  This setup dispense with the need to use a focal plane shutter so unlike a dSLR where the shutter is found in the body, the shutter of the X100 is found in its lens.  The combination of a quiet leaf shutter on the lens and the absence of a mirror-slapping noise means that it is possible for me to shoot the X100 very discretely even in a quiet room.  Even continuous shooting with the X100 generates little noise.  The shutter sound of the X100 shooting continuously is unobtrusive unlike the loud staccato clatter of the dSLR.Another feature the fixed lens arrangement allowed is for Fujifilm to install a built-in 3-stops neutral density filter in the X100.  I wished this was button activated but its fairly easy to access it from the menu.  Once activated, I have a choice of either using a slower shutter speed or to shoot with the aperture wide-open.The X100 can simulate several colored, B&W; and sepia films.  The colored setting are named after the Fuji Films.  The standard setting is Provia.  For landscape (and sometimes even for people), I like using the Velvia for its rich saturated look.  Though one can choose the Vivid on the Nikon D3100, I find the Velvia look on the X100 more pleasing, specially when viewed on the computer.  The Astia is intended for use with soft-tone palette and yields a less-saturated look.  So I took several solo and group shots in the diffused light in the late afternoon with everyone wearing light pastel and earthy colors.  The Astia setting yielded a dreamy old film look which I find very pleasing.The shutter is adjusted using a dedicated top knob beside the shutter release button while the aperture is adjusted using the aperture ring on the lens.  The controls work very well though the adjustment is always in increments of one stop.  This is one area where the dSLR may provide greater flexibility in that it allows the easy adjustment in increment of 1/3 of 1/2 stop.  It is possible to adjust the aperture and shutter speed of the X100 in 1/3 increments but it takes a whole lot longer to do this with the X100.  It is by far faster to just adjust the exposure compensation when one is shooting in aperture priority mode.  Because of the greater effort, I simply adopted and made my exposure adjustment (shutter speed and aperture) in one-stop increment adjustments.CONTINUATION April 17, 2011As someone who cleans his camera after every use upon getting home, one of the things I appreciate about the X100 was that it was designed for photographers who have a nose.  =)As a right-eyed focusing photographer, I can avoid the noise hitting and smearing the rear LCD screen of the X100 whenever I bring it to the eye to look through the viewfinder.  Instead of my nose hitting the rear LCD screen whenever I do this, I am doubly pleased that this no longer happens and that cleaning the camera before putting it away is a bit easier and faster at the end of the day.While video is limited to 720p, it is nonetheless quite good.  The advantage of the X100 having an electronic viewfinder (EVF) becomes evident when one uses it for video.  With the EVF, one can take video while keeping the X100 to one's eye and this makes for a more natural and steady shooting position just like with still photography.  This is similar to the Panasonic GH2 which also has an EVF but in contrast to the Nikon D3100 where the arms would be outstretched in a point and shoot position while using the rear LCD screen take the video.  The Fujifilm X100 can autofocus on video and its pretty fast.  The Panasonic GH2 autofocuses on video faster still but the X100 is much faster than the Nikon D3100 on video.Some have complained about power-up lag.  First off, the type of SD card you use will make a substantial impact on power-up.  A slow SD card can slow down the X100 from power-up to ready-to-use state.  Using a fast SD card will help.  Assuming that one is using an SD card, power up lag will depend on which viewfinder you are using. If you are using the electronic viewfinder, power lag is about 2 seconds. If you are using the optical viewfinder, the power lag is just a little bit above 1 second. In both instances, unless you have the viewfinder to your eyes and ready to shoot, the power lag does not make much of a difference as you still need to bring the camera up to your eyes upon power up, then need some time to compose, check exposure then shoot. While a dSLR like the D70 is almost instantaneous and is faster, it really will not make much of a difference for 99% of the time.UPDATE: June 12, 2011After taking hundreds of photos with this camera, I fully appreciate the solid and sturdy feel this camera imparts whenever one uses it.  As such, it imparts a certain sense of confidence and satisfaction in being able to take good photos in a measured and deliberate manner.  Never designed for sports speed shooting nor for the urgency of events or wedding photographers, the X100 is best used when one can take his time to frame and compose before taking the photo.I can also categorically say that in terms of image quality, the X100 camera can hold its own against some of the best APS-C-sized sensored dSLRs in the market such as the Nikon D7000 for the type of shooting that the X100 was designed for.  The black and white setting of the X100 can be quite intoxicating.  The 3 \"film\" settings of the X100 (Astia, Provia and Velvia) is superb.What has also become clear is the value of the silent shutter of the X100.  Several times, I have had to take photos inside a very quiet church.  The few shots I took with the Nikon FX D700 sounded like gunshots inside a very quiet church and even the considerably softer and quieter Nikon DX D7000 still sounded loud.  I could not continue without causing a major disturbance.  The X100 came to the rescue and allowed me to continue taking photos quietly and unobtrusively.  What has also become of great help is the ability to see the aperture, shutter and exposure compensation settings of the X100 in one glance without needing to view these through the viewfinder.  This has been helpful when shooting from the hip again to avoid disturbing the very quiet and solemn atmosphere in a church.Going on to regular shooting, the electronic viewfinder (EVF) of the X100 allows me to shoot a photo and to review it immediately in the same EVF without need to put down the camera to view the image I just took through the rear LCD screen.  I do not know of any camera that can do this ... not even the GH2 which also has an EVF.  The EVF makes eye-on-camera video shooting very easy.  While limited to 720p with very limited control on the settings, the X100 nonetheless can take very good video even in low light due to its clean images at high ISO.On the other hand, using the optical viewfinder (OVF) of this rangefinder-type camera, I can see a greater area than what the lens cover and this gives me the advantage of better and greater situational awareness that allows me to better compose or anticipate the different elements that I would like to converge in my photos.  With the dSLR, I have to keep both eyes open to do this but it is neither easy nor convenient.  The OVF of the X100 make it a cinch to do this.I should however mention 2 negatives both of which do not go directly into the performance of the X100.  The first is the plastic adapter that comes with the battery charger.  The battery charger is designed for another battery and an adapter is needed to charge the battery used with the X100.  Though this adapter is also supplied with the charger, it is easily dislodged and as a result, could easily be lost making recharging a real challenge.  The second negative is how Fuji has chosen not to design the lens so it can take on a filter (49mm) and also failed to include a hood with the camera.  One needs to buy an expensive adapter that would allow the mounting of a filter on the X100.  Considering that the lens is fixed, scratching the lens can quickly ruin anybody's day.  Still on this, Fuji has also chosen not to include a hood with the lens.  Like the filter adapter, this is again an expensive accessory.  The hood is essential  when shooting outdoors in bright sunlit conditions as well as indoors in harsh lighting conditions.  Fuji may make a handsome profit when an X100 owner buys these but it leaves a bad taste in the mouth when one has to pay so much for something that should not cost much for Fuji to make and which it should have included with the camera as these are essential items.While at it, there are a couple of nitpicks that one can make against the X100 (e.g., difficulty and tediousness of taking multiple shots using a timer) so some of the complaints made against the X100 firmware is justified.  Fuji has already released a firmware upgrade and is expected to release a 2nd sometime soon.  This gives me confidence that many of the nitpicks will eventually be addressed.  And as these minor irritants does not detract from the X100 being a good camera for what is was designed for, I have decided to keep the 5-stars rating for this camera.Finally, I can understand the frustration expressed by some who have reviewed the X100 when they treat and use the X100 as a substitute for their dSLRs.  Having read this review this far, you will perhaps better understand their missives against the X100.  The X100 has been designed for use in a specific niche and it excels within this specialized area.  Outside this area, there are far better camera models out there that would surpass the X100 in size, weight, price, performance, flexibility, or the various combination of these.  A better understanding of the capabilities and design of the X100 will help in avoiding the pitfalls that some have fallen into when they use the X100 as a dSLR substitute.

The Sigma took great pictures but was slow and could not handle candids. I was tempted but not enough. When the X100 was announced it looked like it solved the problems that the Sigma has. I wanted this camera.This camera is not for everyone. Fuji says this camera is for pros and serious amatures. This is true. In designing the camera to appear like an old rangefinder they incorporated program mode, aperature priority, shutter priority and manual mode exactly as they worked in the old cameras. This left out the \"safe mode\" that existes in other cameras that limits what you can do in the menus to things that will really screw up your shooting. In safe mode typically you can't enter a white balance any you can't set the ISO to 12,800. If you don;t know what you are doing with the camera you can mess up all your shots. The manual leaves out some details. The camera has seperate ISOs for program, apertature priority, shutter priority, manual and panorama. Until you realize that changing mode also changes ISO you can loose some pictures. You have to put some effort into learning this camera.The handling is certainly adaquate, but it takes some getting used to. When using the optical viewfinder at close range the focus box in the viewfinder will not correspond to what you are aiming. at. Don't use the optical viewfinder at close range. Problem solved. When you press the shutter button half way down the electric viewfinder  freezes until focus is attained. Not a real problem but for a $1200 camera they should have done better. When changing to and from macro the display does not update fast enought. Another thing to get used to.So why did I rate this camera at 5 stars?Low light pictures are fantistic. The combination of a state of the art APS-C sensor and a f2 lens lets me take great picures under very low light. Any camera can take good pictures in bright light.I like the manual focusing. I know some people think it is useless. Not true. This is not a rangefinder with a quick turn of the focus ring going from minimum focus to infinity. It takes a lot of turns to do that. I like that. I use manual focus when auto focus will not work. I went out seveal nights ago and shot a few test shots at ISO 12,800. The camera wouyld not auto focus in that light but using the distance scale in the viewfinder I was able to take acceptable shots. This manual focus is great for macro shots where you are not sure where the auto focuse is focusing.I like haveing a viewfinder. When using cameras having only screens on the back of the camera I can not see what I am shootine if there is sunlight on the screen. I think I will eventually fully appreciate the hybrid viewfinder, but for now I am glad to have either.I shoot in RAW. THe large sensor gives me more to play with.I like the lack of shutter noise.Having a fixed focal length does not bother me. I think it is actually helping my photograph by making me get closer to my subjects. The pictures are more personnel. (I tried shooting several sessions with my Lumix G1 using only the 29mm lens so I knew this was true before ordering the camers.I like this camera a lot. I was aware that there would be some shortcoming like a lack of zoom but they were acceptable. They will not be acceptable to everyone. If they are acceptable to you this may be the camera for you.", "Date": "May 16, 2011"}, {"Title": "D700 Old School photog loves the X100, but it does have flaws", "Author": "GCFL", "ReviewID": "R2Q2YP4DRG29F2", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I would summarize the X100 as equal to a very good DSLR in picture quality and low-light capability, with a fast lens and manual exposure control, in a package slightly larger than most point-and-shoots.  I think it represents great value in the compact viewfinder category previously occupied only by Leica at about 8x the price.I got the X100 on Friday and promptly went off to Vermont for the weekend to try it out.  I shot a few hundred frames of travel style photos.  I have not used video, flash or the ND filter, so I can't comment on those features other than to say I'm glad they are there.I normally shoot a D700.  I also have three Nikon crop sensor DSLRs that I rarely use because I am in love with the controls and image quality of my full-frame D700.  I got the X100 for travel and street photography, because I wanted a camera I could always have with me.  I was tired of relying on my iPhone as my carry-around camera when I don't or can't carry a camera backpack.  I am 56.  I started shooting in 1970 with an Argus C3, a rangefinder 35mm, so I admit I am a little drawn to the X100 for nostalgic reasons, although I have to say I'm not that nostalgic for my C3 (which I still have).  I am a computer scientist/electrical engineer, so I am also firmly planted in the digital age.I don't know of a camera on the market today that I would rather use for travel or street photography.  When I'm doing travel it is street photography, landscape, still life, architectural and portrait.  I would not hesitate to head off to another continent with only this camera.  Since I don't do weddings/events, nature/animals or sports, I don't need a zoom or long lens.  With this camera I don't have to compromise on capabilities (other than lens selection) or image quality.If I want to pack one camera, I have found it in the X100.  If I want to take a back pack, then I can take a DSLR with lenses and flash (and now this camera thrown in).  The next step up is a carry-on with bodies, lenses, flashes, etc..  I have a larger bag that has to be checked for light stands, modifiers, etc, if I want to carry a portable studio set-up.  The X100 has finally given me a one-camera travel set-up whose compromises I can life with.I'll start with the positives on the X100.- The ergonomics (except for the manual focus ring, which I will go into later) and looks are attractive to me.  I'm 6'3\", 200lbs and my hands aren't too big to access all the buttons easily.- I was astounded by the high ISO performance.  I haven't scrutinized the images I have taken in pixel-level detail, but up to 1600, which is as far as I dared venture, I don't notice the difference between the ISO 200 and ISO 1600 images.  By comparison, I immediately see the difference on all my Nikons, even the D700.  I haven't done any large prints of these first shots, so my opinion may change once I scrutinize the noise levels more closely.  But at first glance, the low-light performance exceeded my expectations.- It is silent (I only use it in silent mode), making it ideal for street and travel photography.  You can grab shots you couldn't or wouldn't get with a noisy DSLR.- You can shoot handheld at slow shutter speeds.  Not having the mass of a mirror and focal plane shutter moving around keeps the camera still, which allows for slower shutter speed hand-helds.  I may be imagining this, but I was able to do handheld shots at night at shutter speeds I wouldn't attempt with a DSLR.  When you combine the fast lens, low-light performance and ability to shoot handheld at slow shutter speeds, it opens up a world of low-light possibilities.- The lens/sensor combination produces beautiful images.  I don't feel like I'm sacrificing quality over any of the Nikons, even the D700.  I just think that semiconductor technology has continued to move forward since the D700 sensor was designed and the X100, by combining the design of the sensor and the lens as a single system, represents state-of-the-art technology, and the results are visible in the images.- The macro capabilities work, which adds versatility to the single 35mm-equivalent lens.  I had absolutely no focusing problems doing macro shots using the EVF and the focusing method I describe below.-  I have no complaints with the EVF.  I didn't fully understand the viewfinder options before I got the camera in my hands.  It really has three modes, EVF, OVF and LCD.  I use almost exclusively the EVF.  I found the OVF doesn't allow focus confirmation and the electronic framing guide doesn't appear accurate enough for me.  I didn't notice the lag times reported by others with the EVF, but I think that is because I am not using the partial-depression auto-focusing method.  It is easy to use the lever to switch between EVF and OVF.  A button on the back turns the LCD on and off.-  Lightroom supports the RAW format, which I was pleased to learn.The negatives:-  The manual focus ring is useless.  The focus-by-wire (no mechanical coupling between focus ring and optics) implementation is flawed.  It could be the firmware or it could be the focus ring position encoder lacks sufficient resolution.  When you turn the focus ring, the servo-controlled optics jump in annoying discrete steps and requires way too many turns.  This could be just an extremely poor implementation of the servo control firmware, or it could be that the focus ring position is only readable in coarse increments.  Whatever the reason, don't buy this camera if you require the feel of turning a manual focus ring.  I was in that camp until very recently.  But I don't think this is a show-stopper for the X100, and here's why:  I have always hated auto-focus hunting problems and had continued to rely on manual focusing on my DSLRs until very recently.  I discovered that with a single focus point and using the AFL/AEL button to focus, you can essentially do what I would call optically-assisted servo-controlled manual focus.  This way of using \"auto focus\" marries the speed and accuracies of the servo control and contrast-detection with the control of manual focus that I insist upon.  To do this on the X100 you put it in manual focus mode, make sure you are set to single-spot focus, then put the indicated focus area over what you want to focus on from any of the viewfinders, and press the AFL/AEL button.  In my use, the X100 accurately locks on the desired focus point much quicker and more accurately than I could have done by twisting a focus ring and squinting through the viewfinder.  Trying to use multi-point and/or partial depression of the shutter release button is problematic in ways I won't go into.  Since switching from manual focus ring focusing to this electronic-assisted method on my DSLR, I haven't had any focus problems.  On the X100, this is the mandatory method of focusing in my opinion.  I didn't miss one shot because of focus problems.  I didn't have problems in low-light (even with the AF-assist illuminator de-activated in silent mode) and I didn't experience the reported EVF blanking problems.  You have to get the camera set up correctly to make this work.- Buy an extra battery.  The battery charge indicator is inaccurate in the current firmware release.  The battery life is short by Nikon DSLR standards.  I was not taking measures to conserve battery and I only filled a little over half a 4 GB card with RAW images before the battery went dead on me.- The bracketing only goes +/- 1/3, 1/2 and 1 EV.  For HDR, you need to go at least to 2 EV.  This seems like it could easily be fixable with a firmware update.- The Fn button cannot be programmed to control bracketing or AEL, both of which are more useful to me than any of the many things it can be programmed to control, many of which are post-processing effects not useful to a RAW shooter.  I have the Fn button set to control ISO.  But I shoot mostly in aperture-priority and I would like to be able to assign AEL to the Fn button.  The work-around is to use partial-depression to meter TTL in the desired metering mode, then lock the exposure by just setting the measured shutter speed, switching from aperture-priority to manual exposure mode.  The way I have focusing set up, a partial depression won't alter the focus, so you aren't trying to use spot metering and spot focusing on two distinct spots with only one activation button.  When I start using flash with the X100 I am sure I would like to be able to assign Flash Value Lock (FVL) to the Fn button.  But you can't do that either.  In fact, there doesn't appear to be a FVL implemented in the current firmware release.- The X100 does seem to have a slower processor than my Nikon DSLRs.  It does feel like a point-and-shoot at times.  For $1200 I think they should have used a beefier processor.  But I had just thrown in a 15MB/s card, so I don't know how much of the processing time was write-speed related and how much was processor speed.  It could be poor firmware design.  It seems to have problems multi-tasking.  For example, it blanks the EVF while it processes and stores images.  This only was noticeable to me when shooting bursts or bracketing where the time to process and store multiple images became aggravating.  This could easily be solved by a faster card and may be entirely my fault if it is a function of storage speed and not processing speed.I agree that contributing to what I feel is the success of this design is the decision to trade off lens interchangeability in exchange for a viewfinder that works in a small package at a reasonable price.  However, I'd like to suggest to FujiFilm that they produce the same model in different focal lengths, e.g. 20 or 24, 50 and 85mm (full-frame equivalents).  Then I would just switch cameras instead of switching lenses.  After all, you could buy about eight X100's for the price of one Leica M9 with 35mm lens.  I'm a prime shooter, and the 35mm focal length is my standard on my DSLRs, so this camera fits me in the current configuration.  If you're married to zooms or telephotos, then this is probably not the camera for you.If I were teaching a series of basic digital photography courses, I would suggest every student start with this camera.  Many might find it is the only camera they would ever need.UPDATE 5/17I learned that if you have it in MF mode and use the AFL/AEL button to focus, you can do a partial depression of the shutter release to lock in exposure (AEL).  But you must focus first if using the AFL/AEL button, then move to position you want to set exposure (especially if using spot metering) with a partial depression, then while continually partially depressing the shutter release, reframe and release the shutter.  (The AFL/AEL button won't operate the focus while partially depressing the shutter release.)  This method gives you the flexibility to focus on one point, set exposure on another, and frame in a third position.I thought there was no manual control in MOVIE mode, but it appears that you can adjust aperture, but not shutter speed.", "Date": "May 16, 2011"}, {"Title": "Is it possible to love a camera?", "Author": "Eric C. Williams", "ReviewID": "RN40HDUXEFHHO", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This camera is not for everyone.I used to carry a big DSLR rig with me everywhere. I commuted to work with a camera backpack containing my body, some lenses, my laptop and other stuff. Then I had one kid... and two kids... and three kids... and carrying around a DSLR, even just the body and one lens, got to be a huge hassle. So I turned to point-and-shoot cameras. I used a PowerShot S90 as my primary camera for quite some time, but I was never satisfied with the fact that I couldn't get the same kind of image quality out of my PowerShot as I was able to get from my DSLR.I needed to find something that had the image quality of a DSLR and the portability of a point-n-shoot. Of course, there is no such thing. But the X100 is as close as it gets. I carry this camera with me everywhere, all the time, in the outside pocket of my \"man purse\". And the image quality coming out of this camera... well, I think it's stunning. I love the color, contrast and sharpness this camera can produce. Its lens flares are lovely, its bokeh is sublime. There is something about this camera's output that is really unique. I think my infatuation with the X100 began the minute I saw sample photos.But this is not an easy camera to use. Unfortunately it is highly idiosyncratic and a little buggy. It took me a few weeks to understand all the little rituals I had to go through to use it properly: Don't forget to take it out of macro mode before putting the lens cap on. Remember to compensate for the macro focus-shift bug by moving backwards ever so slightly after autofocus lock. Use manual focus with the auto-focus override to take a series of macro photos without waiting for the unbelievably slow macro autofocus. The list goes on.But once you learn how to get the most out of this camera it becomes a very powerful photographic tool. I have taken stunning low-light long-exposure photos. Awesome snaps of the kids. Long exposures in very bright light (the ND filter rocks). Incredible action shots taken at very fast shutter speeds. Pictures of unbelievable sharpness and detail. This list goes on, too.Something else about this camera is the fact that it's a pure joy to hold and operate. The build quality and feel are off the charts. Everything is solid and precise. It looks and feels like you're holding a vintage Leica. People are drawn to it. Many think you are indeed holding a vintage Leica. It's simply beautiful.The unique hybrid viewfinder on this camera is also something special. I don't tend to use it in OVF (optical viewfinder) mode that often, but I can see how it would be perfect for landscape photography and the like. Personally I use it in EVF (electronic viewfinder) mode. I like this mode because it saves battery, reduces glare, shows me exactly what I am framing, and allows me to point the lens at very bright things (i.e. the sun) without hurting my eyes.I should mention this is a great camera for street photography. Use zone focusing, carry it about, no one cares at all. It's unobtrusive, and perfect for capturing life as it happens.Battery life is very good. It's almost as good as the battery life on my PowerShot S90, and that's saying something. It's far better than the battery life of any DSLR I'm aware of.So, why shouldn't you get this camera? Well, there are four primary reasons:The first is that this camera has a terrible focusing system. It's almost inexcusable. The autofocus is very, very slow. And the manual focus-by-wire is also very, very slow. Learning how to combine manual focus with autofocus for faster picture taking is one of the hurdles to using this camera. I take a lot of kid pictures, and this camera struggles to keep up with them. It can be hard getting the shot I want, and I have been frustrated more than once because I missed something even the cheapest DSLR would have gotten.The second reason you might not want this camera is the fixed lens. I hope you like the focal length because you don't get to change it.Next, the weird threading on the lens makes attaching normal accessories like filters and hoods a bit of a pain, and the Fujifilm accessories for this camera are astronomically expensive and hard to find.Finally, you might not want this camera if you are not willing to invest the time necessary to learn how to use it properly. It is not user friendly. It's buggy. You have to learn how to work with it, and around it. For some people this is a huge barrier to entry, and I personally don't blame them. I think Fujifilm dropped the ball here.But, all that said, if you are fine with the cost and the bugs and the learning curve and the fixed lens and everything else, what you are left with is a camera that is utterly joyful to shoot with. Carrying this camera around just feels right. It's simply pleasurable. And the photos you get can be of astounding quality.So what you are considering here may not be a purchase so much as a relationship. The X100 and I are pretty happy together. ;-)", "Date": "October 14, 2011"}, {"Title": "An Unbelievable Experience with the Fuji X100", "Author": "Steven M. Frankel", "ReviewID": "R1M6GVV372SRHZ", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Yesterday I picked up my Fuji X100 and it looks like it's everything I hoped for in a camera I use mostly for cruises and street photography.  Working around the water a lot, my 2 absolute requirements were a high-quallity lens and a great viewfinder.  The X100 has a really nice optical viewfinder, a high quality electronic viewfinder (as good I think as the one on the Lumix GH2 that I recently sold), and a reasonably good LCD finder on the back.  I went straight from the store to Marina del Rey to try it at the California Yacht Club on a bright sunny afternoon.  The optical finder was impeccable, showing a really bright framed image with the important exposure info underneath the frame (a first I believe); the electronic finder was fair since in bright sunlight it (just as my GH2) tends to go dark, and the LCD which was essentially useless as nearly all LCDs when faced with very bright sunlight and reflections off the water.When I go home and uploaded the shots to my computer they were really high quality and could easily be enlarged BEYOND 8x10.  Fuji says 13x19 without noticeable loss of quality).Handling-wise, the camera is a (mostly) beautiful dream.  It looks and handles like my Nikkormat FTN with a 1.9 50mm  lens that had seen service with a military photographer in Japan in the late 1950's and I had used in the early 1960s.  It's just as fast, light, well-balanced and quiet as a classic Nikon; and 2 yacht club members who saw me on the docks with it stopped me and asked me admiringly what it was, how much it cost and -- even after hearing \"$1200\" -- asked me where they could get one.There are only 2 flies in this proverbial ointment.First -- just like the Nikkormat when I was working my way through college doing photography and I couldn't afford additional lenses to shoot weddings and sports events -- it comes with only one lens (an f2.0 35mm equivalent) and that lens is not interchangeable.  However I find myself enjoying the simplicity of toting only one small camera and a semi-wide angle lens; and I think I'll end up a better photographer by imposing this discipline on myself.  Also, for most of the kinds of photography I enjoy, cruise photos and street photos, the 35mm lens is ideal.  For the remainder I'll relay on another camera with a zoom lens and that fits in my pocket.  For now it's a Canon S95 that I really enjoy.  However, I blew up some photos yesterday that I took at the same time with both cameras, and while both of them produced excellent results, at higher levels of enlargement the Fuji with its much larger sensor blows away the Canon.  In the future, if I can get a really good buy on a small used DSLR which I can equip with one of the very light 28--270 zoom lenses that have just come out, maybe I'll pick up that also as a (gulp) third camera.The second fly in the ointment is that this is definitely a camera you need to READ THE WHOLE DAMN MANUAL!!!  I want to go beyond the basics and take advantage of its additional capabilities that justify its price; and so far I've put in about 5 hours of reading the manual and the better reviews to gain the info I need .  It's far from intuitive and quite different from the Canons and Panasonics that I've been using almost exclusively for the past five years.However, with these 2 caveats, the X100 is to cameras what Regent, Silverseas, Crystal and Seabourn ships are to cruising.  All are exquisitely made and of impeccable quality.  If that fits your lifestyle, don't hesitate to buy a Fuji X100!A few days later:I started off a thread on Cruise Critic's Camera Discussion Group by posing the question:  If weight is at a premium, what's the best combo of camera equipment I can take on my next cruise?  For the last few years I have carried a Panasonic Lumix GH1/GH2 and a Canon SD780IS, and I've gotten tired of leaving my 6-8 pound gadget bag in the cabin or on the bus, and just grabbing the GH1/GH2 with one lens, or the cigarette pack-sized Canon, while walking around on a tour.  Therefore I sold this outfit and decided to start out fresh.I can now proudly report that I've cut down my gadget bag weight to 47 ounces and increased my quality to boot.  I'm now packing the Fujifilm X100 and the Canon S95:  That's 15 oz. for the X100; 9 oz. for the S95 and its Case Logic case and spare battery & SD card; and 23 oz. for Lowepro Edit 120 gadget bag, a spare battery & SD card for the X100, and the battery chargers and USB cords for both cameras (naturally they're different).Spurred on by my promise to the members of the discussion group to try out the X100 on shooting birds in flight, I went down to the Marina del Rey boat dock today and got a terrific picture of a crane landing on the dock, taken while the bird was still in flight.  If someone can tell me, offline, how I can post this large jpeg, I'll be happy to post it.  I also got a nice image of another crane flying about 50' away in which the bird was dead-center in the photograph and quite sharp for a small bird flying fast about 30' high.  I finished off the day by taking some very nice and very sharp candid shots at our Mother's Day brunch which we celebrated a day early.Suffice to say that I really believe the Fuji X100 is the best digital camera I've ever used.  I would have to get back to shots I took in the 1960s with Nikkormats, Rollicords, and Yashicamats to equal its combination of sharpness, size and easy handling.By the way, the day before I had tried out the Canon S95 at the bait dock.  Due to the bright sun, this was a complete bust!  The shots are exposed properly but framing was usually far from satisfactory due to the difficulty I had with using the LCD to track birds flying over the water.  On less challenging tasks, such as candids I took last week in a restaurant, it served admirably except that it's available light shots were not as sharp as the X100s when I blew them up to 8x10 size.In summary, I think the X100 is the ONE camera I'll take whenever I leave the ship; although I'll try to smuggle the Canon into my wife's fanny pack for emergency uses or when cameras are \"forbidden\" or when a 90mm zoom is essential.  Its optical finder is so useful on the water that I don't anything, short of a heavier and complex DSLR or electronic finder camera such as the GH2, can keep up with it.Update:For the past 6 months or so, my favorite travel camera has been the Fuji X100.  It has logged about 3000 shots that were taken on a cruise from Los Angles to Barbados; a cruise from Istanbul to Athens; and during 2 yacht races where I shot more than 1000 shots from the committee boats.I've been tremendously satisfied with the camera, despite its well-documented quirks and fixed 35mm-equivilent  focal length, because of its unparalled ability to shoot \"a black cat in a coal bin,\" its choice of 3 finders, its great handling, and its sharp & colorful images.  Nevertheless, I've got the new Sony NEX 7 on order in the hope of getting an even better cruise and street camera.Then, a few weeks ago, my wife was going to a costume event and was dressed up in the style of Cindy Lauper.  She asked me to shoot her as she was leaving the house.  I did so and liked the results so much that I ordered a 16x20\" print done on a framed canvas for her birthday.  The canvas photo arrived yesterday and the results -- without any touch-up or sharpening -- were stunning:  great color and razor-sharp without any flaws or blurring.  Frankly, in 45 years as a professional and advanced amateur, it's probably the best 16x20\" I've ever produced; surpassing hundreds of 11x14s and 16x20s I took with the top film cameras.We have truly advanced to a new era.  I'm eager to see if the NEX 7, equipped with the Zeiss 2.0  fixed 36mm equivalent lens, can equal the X-100's images or whether the NEX 7 will have a short stay in my home.", "Date": "May 5, 2011"}, {"Title": "Flawed Diamond - X100 thoughts from an NEX & Nikon owner", "Author": "C.S. Michael", "ReviewID": "R1N0WIEFK5MD4T", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Like many people, I want DSLR quality without DSLR weight. I also own a Sony NEX-3 (and a Nikon D7000). I'm not unhappy with the NEX system, but the NEX-3 shutter sounds like a food processor. NEX design is typical Sony -- sleek, contemporary, & cold. Although the NEX is small, it's not discreet.I like prime lenses and was considering the $1000 Carl Zeiss 24mm lens for the NEX when I realized that the Fujifilm X100 is priced similarly. So I got a stealthy camera instead of an expensive lens.One can't really comment on the camera without mentioning its timeless styling. The X100 is a beautiful piece of kit. Build quality is solid. If you appreciate old school camera design, weighted by a generous amount of real metal, you will love this one. It's got character that contemporary-styled cameras like the NEX lack.This is a case where form follows function. The best aspect of the X100 is the manual control - dedicated controls for aperture, shutter speed, and exposure control. It's wonderful to be able to quickly change these settings with such ease. I have never found the twiddly control wheels of DLSRs to be intuitive; dedicated controls make all the difference.The X100 is a photographer's camera. It shoots video, but my NEX does a better job with video (and accepts Sony's external mic for improved audio). The X100 has a dedicated \"RAW\" button but no \"movie\" button! To more easily access video, I set my X100's programmable function button to switch into the camera's movie mode. I wish the video mode was more robust, but really, you don't buy an X100 for video. You buy it for stills.The X100 is amazingly QUIET. If you turn off the assorted beeps and artificial shutter sounds, the leaf shutter is almost SILENT - a nice advantage for street photography, or any other locations where you want to keep a low profile.The camera is not perfect. The majority of its flaws appear to be software related. It's like Fuji launched this product without thoroughly vetting the firmware. On more than one occasion the firmware has crashed altogether! With the camera frozen, I had to remove the battery to reboot. My Sony and Nikon have never crashed.And speaking of the battery, the \"battery life remaining\" indicator is a joke. It goes from FULL to EMPTY almost immediately, without warning. You will need at least one, probably two, extra batteries. Fortunately, aftermarket batteries are available for cheap.If there's any upside to these firmware problems, it's that Fuji can improve matters by issuing updates. They do seem to be committed to making it better and have released several updates that have eliminated bugs, extended battery life, etc.The hybrid optical and electronic viewfinder is innovative and fun to use. Sometimes, however, it can be a little annoying because info appears inside the viewfinder instead of the LCD screen, and vice versa. (This is all easily adjusted in the camera settings, but it's also easily misadjusted.)Some people complain about menu navigation, but I have no problems with it.There are some minor hardware design issues. For example, the \"OK\" button is poorly executed - it sits flush with the body when it should be more pronounced. And if you're not careful, you may accidentally bump the exposure compensation dial.Focus is a major weakness. You need to be ready and willing to switch focus modes and/or use macro mode in order for the autofocus to do its job. And it needs to do its job, since manual focus is pretty much useless. The X100 does not offer peaking (unlike the NEX) and the fly-by-wire manual focus is a disappointment.Oddly, the X100 is endearing despite these quirks. This is an enthusiast's camera, evidenced by the many options to \"bling\" the X100. Soft shutter releases, gorgeous custom leather cases, thumb grips, even improved \"OK\" buttons - there are several aftermarket solutions to the aforementioned problems. My wife recently chuckled and observed, \"Every day you seem to be getting something new for that camera.\"Then there's what really counts - image quality. Overall, with its APS-C sensor and perfectly matched 35mm equivalent f2 lens, the X100 is a powerhouse in the image department. I am getting better images out of my X100 than I did my NEX-3. (Whether the NEX with Carl Zeiss lens would be competitive, I do not know.) Low noise at high ISO. The fill flash of the X100 does a great job. I love the 24mm focal length. Fuji color is beautiful. The auto white balance is very effective. My X100 produces noticeably better skin tones than both the NEX and D7000.The X100 excels at photos of people. You'll still want your DSLR for wildlife and sports.The X100 is a bit of an anomaly. Sometimes using it can be frustrating. You will miss some photos because the camera's focusing ability is so poor. But every once in a while, you will absolutely NAIL a photo and the results will make you go \"WOW!\" The spectacular shots help you forget all the blurry ones.Once you spend some time with the X100, you'll understand how it's targeted at enthusiasts and professionals. You at least need an active interest in photography to get the most out of this camera. It's not that amateurs can't enjoy the camera too; but utilizing the controls and options is necessary to coax the best images out of this camera.If you simply want a mindless point-and-shoot you probably won't like the X100. If you want more of a video / stills hybrid cam, look at an NEX. But if you want a real photographer's tool in a portable package, you'll LOVE the X100. I've never owned a camera quite like it. It's got mojo. This is a digital camera with an analog heart.", "Date": "February 2, 2012"}, {"Title": "You Broke My Heart, Fuji!", "Author": "Noirist", "ReviewID": "R1N8SX6R9JQ4XV", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "Beautiful compact body. Large APS-C sized sensor with outstanding low-light performance and class-leading DxOMark score. Fast f2.0 lens from top-tier lens manufacturer. Innovative optical/electronic view finder. Favorable initial reviews from trusted sources like Luminous Landscape. Could this be the perfect carry-everywhere camera? I could not resist any longer and was fortunate enough to get one from the first batch of Amazon orders. WOOO HOOO!!!!!The camera arrived last week and since it arrived I have been taking pictures with it every day in all the situations where I wouldn't normally bring my GH1 or D3S. Inside and outside. Bright light and low light. People and things. Pictures of friends and family at home, out-and-about, on nature walks, in restaurants, at school. Pictures of food served in restaurants. Pictures of my children's classmates in the classroom and on the playground. Pictures of flowers and bugs and plants. And each picture I took dragged me kicking and screaming and ultimately crying to the unavoidable conclusion that this camera is fatally and tragically flawed.Like the hero of a Greek tragedy, the Fujifilm X100 has the most promising of attributes, each with a fatal flaw, and the outcome is photographic tragedy. This camera has delivered more out-of-focus shots than I have ever experienced in my three decades of photography. Of more than five hundred pictures that I've taken with the X100 in the past week, less than 50 are in focus and only a handful are keepers. With firmware 1.01, the X100 can only reliably take good pictures of stationary well-lit subjects, like static scenes or posed people.Let's start with the innovative optical viewfinder (OVF). It has a white rectangle in the middle that turns green when the camera acquires focus. But the OVF doesn't tell you what part of the scene is in focus and it most definitely is not that white rectangle in the middle. (This is partially mitigated by the 2011/06/24 firmware update.) My only consistent success with the OVF is with static scenes entirely contained in the chosen depth of field, like pictures of a wall. If you want to know what part of the scene is in focus, you must use the electronic viewfinder (EVF). But the EVF has a perceptable lag so you can't use it to time your shutter. And even worse, when you initiate auto-focus, the EVF is momentarily frozen and by the time it unfreezes and you can see your subjects to be in focus and properly framed, your subjects may have moved on, so when you release the shutter you end up with another out-of-focus shot. My only consistent success with the EVF is with static or posed subjects, like the ones that appeared in the Luminous Landscape and Steve Huff reviews. Don't believe me? Check the X100 image samples on dpreview -- there are only two pictures with non-static subjects (DSCF0345, two girls on a rocking horse, DSCF0422 couple hugging), and they're both out-of-focus. I didn't count DSCF0426 (woman in front of mosaic) even though the woman was out-of-focus because the mosaic was the subject.Second consider the fast f2.0 Fuji lens that I have coveted since the X100 was announced at Photokina 2010. It lacks optical image stabilization (OIS). So if you're shooting handheld, you have to keep the shutter above 1/60 or better still 1/125 to avoid handheld motion blur. Its soft at f2.0. So if you want a sharp image, you're going to have to stop down to f2.8 or better yet f4.0. And now you're looking a camera that's not so great at low light anymore unless you stick it on a tripod and what's the point of a compact camera that must be mounted on a tripod?Third the auto-focus. It only works well for subjects that are well front-lit. As the light decreases or moves behind the subject, the X100 quickly gets to the point where it can't auto-focus at all even with the very intrusive AF assist light. \"No problem,\" I thought, \"I'll switch to manual focus and use this beautiful focus ring on the front of the camera\". But that focus ring is only tenuously connected to the camera's focus point, and the connection is 100% electronic. You can turn the focus ring 10 times in the same direction and still the focus will only have changed a tiny bit. Even something so basic as using the ring to move the focus to the closest focus point (4\") or the farthest focus point (infinity) is 100% unpredictable and 100% annoying. So if you want to acquire accurate focus, you have to use the auto-focus with the EVF, a wide f-stop, and the scene better be well front-lit or the auto-focus will hunt hunt hunt and never acquire focus.Fourth the camera's controls. The X100 has dedicated controls for aperture, shutter speed, and exposure compensation. As expected, you change those settings whenever you want and they take effect immediately (provided you don't switch between automatic and manual modes). The X100 also has a dedicated ring for manual focus and dedicated buttons for metering, auto-focus point position, changing OVF/EVF/LCD, macro mode, flash, white balance, shooting mode (aka \"drive\"), menu, and a custom function button that can be set to the ND filter or ISO (among others). Unfortunately you cannot use any of those controls or change any of those settings while the camera is recording an image. With a premium 30MB/s Sandisk Extreme SDHC card, the X100 takes between 7 and 10 seconds to record a single RAW+JPG image and 30 seconds to record a burst. During that time, you can't switch between the OVF/EVF/LCD, change the metering mode, move the auto-focus point, manually set the focus, turn the ND filter on or off, change the ISO, or turn the flash on or off. Nor can you switch between auto-aperture and manual aperture, or between auto-shutter and manual shutter while the camera is saving an image. That's right, after every picture the X100 controls are frozen for 7-30 seconds, including the manual focus ring. It's so difficult to believe, so out of the range of thinkable thought, that few reviewers have noticed it. It's annoying if you're shooting a static scene, but the scene isn't changing so you can just wait until the red light stops blinking and then change your settings. But if you're recording a dynamic scene, it's intolerable.That's the synopsis of Greek tragedy that is the Fuji Finepix X100. All the desirable attributes of a camera in a camera that can only consistently take good pictures of well front-lit static or scripted scenes. Over the past week, I grew to appreciate my Nikon D3s even more by way of contrast with the X100. I realized that my D3s is big and heavy but it is the ultimate clutch camera. No matter what the photographic situation, I am sure to walk away with some outstanding shots from the D3s. The Fuji X100 is the exact opposite - in most photographic situations, I am likely to walk away with no good shots at all. The Fuji X100 is the ultimate choke camera.There are some other problems with the camera that I would gladly overlook if the camera could take more in focus pictures. But I'll include them anyway in case you wouldn't be able to overlook them.The camera is uncomfortable to shoot one-handed. It's significantly heavier than a LX3 or GH1 w/ 20mm f1.7. It doesn't have a grip and the front is covered with slippery plastic material so that when shooting one-handed you have to support it from the bottom with your pinkie, which quickly becomes uncomfortable. Even my monster D3s with the 24-70mm f2.8 zoom is more comfortable to shoot one-handed than the X100.There's one customizable \"function\" button but no dedicated button for ISO, the ND filter, for burst mode, or to take a movie. I set it to the ND filter, which means I have to trust to the (mostly good) auto ISO setting.The 720p24 movies that the X100 takes are good, although they are often out-of-focus and the camera is very slow to reacquire focus. If I had to take a movie, I'd pick my GH1 and TM700 far ahead of my LX3, D3s, or X100. Next on the list (and far down) I would probably pick the D3s with manual focusing even though I dislike manual focusing - at least I could choose an appropriate lens for the situation and there's always hope that the movie would be in focus and if not I could only blame myself. The LX3 movies are always in focus but the colors are faded and grainy even in bright light so I would more likely take a chance on the X100 than enduring the LX3 movies.The X100 can capture more detail in a static well-lit scene than the Nikon D3s does with a similar number of pixels. The colors in the RAW files are chalky and the greens in the RAW files are very brown. Not sure how this affects the JPEG conversion since my favorite RAW program (DxO) doesn't yet support the Fuji X100.The menus aren't any better or worse than the menus from Panasonic, Canon, or Nikon. The lack of \"menu resume\" is annoying.The on-camera flash is excellent. Somehow Fuji has programmed the on-camera flash to emit just the right amount of flash to improve the picture. It's the only camera I have with a built-in flash where direct flash pictures can often look better than non-flash pictures.To save batteries, I turn off image review, turn on \"OVF power save mode\", and reduce the LCD intensity, so I haven't yet had a problem with battery life. I appreciate that Fuji decided to use one of their standard batteries and chargers instead of making a new battery size for every camera like Panasonic does to my great annoyance.Ultimately, the Fuji Finepix X100 is a very limited use camera. It can't replace an LX3, GH1, D7000, or D3s. In perfect conditions it is capable of taking better images than any of those cameras, but in real world use it is unlikely to do so. You broke my heart, Fuji.**Update 2011/06/24**On June 24, 2011, Fujifilm provided a firmware update 1.10 that claims to fix an astounding twenty two defects in the camera. Most of the repaired defects were related to inconsistencies in the user interface. The 1.10 firmware also adds a \"Corrected AF Frame\" feature that appears to improve the operation of the OVF. According to the updated X100 user manual (p.87), \"A second focus frame for focus distances of about 80cm will be added to the display in the optical viewfinder. The focus frame for the current focus distance is displayed in green when the shutter button is pressed halfway.\" I no longer have an X100 to test, but it sounds like the corrected AF frame gives a better idea of what the camera is focusing on when using the OVF.", "Date": "May 10, 2011"}, {"Title": "An abbreviated review.", "Author": "RTM", "ReviewID": "R2SHKJ7J392TIB", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I'll save you the time of reading a 10 paragraph review of technical info.Who/what this camera is for: This is the carry-everywhere camera for the professional or advanced photographer; someone who would love a Leica M9, but doesn't have $10,000+ laying around.  It takes amazing pictures of landscapes and nature, but it REALLY excels at pictures of people.  Sharpness, clarity, and skin tone reproduction are amazing.  It's quick enough to capture action or a candid moment, but not nearly as fast as a DSLR (especially if you're shooting raw, which..who the hell needs raw on a point and shoot?) so don't use it for that purpose.  I also own a Nikon D7000 and a host of Nikon's finest glass, but found myself leaving that all at home because I didn't want to lug it around.  This doesn't REPLACE your DSLR, so don't expect it to.  It complements it for everyday, carry-everywhere shooting.  That said, it's not a pocket camera.. it's more of a strap around your neck type of camera.  98% of the time I leave the thing in auto ISO, auto WB, and shutter speed, and generally select the aperture myself.  I've shot in full-manual mode (which I do about 100% of the time on my DSLR), but in most cases I'm using this to catch candid moments and I don't want to miss them because I'm fiddling around with the settings.  It does a fantastic job of selecting those by itself.  It's not perfect, but no human is perfect either.Who it isn't for:-Someone who doesn't have $1,200 laying around either.  It's not cheap, and because it's a limited run model, it won't be getting any cheaper.  Accessories are outrageously expensive if you buy OEM (the hood and filter adapter are about $130, the OEM case is around $150).  Yes, cheap knockoffs are out there, but would you put chrome hubcaps on a Mercedes because they kind of achieve the same goal?-Someone who is easily frustrated.  The firmware is buggy and the menus are tough to get used to, but you'll be fine after a couple days of shooting and playing.-Action shooters.  It's just not fast enough, plus the 23MM lens is fairly wide and as such can't really isolate your subject with a narrow DOF.Pros:-IQ is nothing short of amazing.-Looks.  Old school exterior with a refined digital interior.-Handling.  No surfing the menus for aperture or shutter speed, should you choose to take control.-Feel.  Everything feels.. perfect.  Fuji spent quite a long time getting the feels of the dials and knobs on the front and top perfect; they are positive and feel like quality, not like cheapo easily broken plastic.-Sensor.  Full APS-C sized image sensor that you'd find in a crop frame DSLR (D90, D7000, D300S, etc).  About 35x as much sensor area as a Canon S100 Point and shoot.  This translates to substantially lower noise, especially when shooting high ISO.-F/2 lens.  Bokeh is decent, but with the lens being slightly wide don't expect the same kind of results you'd achieve with a fast tele lens.-Low light shooting.  See the above two; fast lens plus low noise performance even at higher ISOs means you don't need flash.-Fill flash.  Meters amazingly well by itself; it gives you the right amount of flash for the situation, meaning it's great for fill flash on faces in outdoor situations.  If you expose for a shadowed face on a sunny day, you'll clip the highlights just to get enough brightness on the face.  This takes care of all of that without you even knowing it.-EVF.  Very cool, though I rarely use it.Cons:-Price.  It's expensive but not overpriced, there's a difference.-No zoom or interchangeable lenses(relative con).  You'll have to just use your feet.  On one hand, it's a disadvantage to not have the ability to switch the lens out for a zoom or tele, but on the other hand THIS lens was made for THIS sensor on THIS camera with THIS camera's geometry.  Primes are always sharper than zooms, so it's a a tradeoff I'm willing to accept.-Frustrating menus and firmware.  Fuji already fixed a lot of the bugs in a firmware update, so expect more fixes in the future.-Leaf shutter(relative con). The shutter can't open and close fast enough to shoot the fastest shutter speeds at it's widest aperture, meaning you're limited in your control of DOF on a very bright day.  The built in ND filter gives you 3 stops, but this may not be enough.  You can use the optional filter adapter ring to attach an extra ND filter to alleviate this, should you need to.-Fuji's profit-seeking engineering.  You can't just attach a filter; the lens body is reverse threaded, and if you just screw a filter on backwards the lens will hit the glass when focusing close.  This means you'll need to buy the AR-X100 adapter ring for about $40, or you can Jerry-rig something up (like a second filter with the glass removed) to give you the spacing, but it will look chintzy, especially on a silver camera that's meant to look sleek.-Lens cap.  Looks cool, functions crappy.  No lock, it just slides on with friction and has no tether, meaning you'll lose it.  Just put an ND filter on with the ring and leave the cap in your bag.-Charger.  Seriously Fuji?  The batteries will only charge with the included small (quarter sized) piece of non-tethered plastic that holds them in place.  I can't believe that this even exists at any level, much less on a $1,200 camera.-Manual focusing.  It's a fly-by-wire system, meaning there's no mechanical connection between the ring and the focusing elements.  It is essentially an electronic knob, and it's SLOW.-LCD Screen.  It's a decent 460k pixel screen and the color is accurate, but at this price level I'd have liked to see a 921k pixel screen that comes on the higher end DSLRs now.  Seems kind of antiquated after I've used that amazing screen on my D7000 for awhile now.", "Date": "December 15, 2011"}, {"Title": "Fantastic Image Quality, Not For the Faint of Heart", "Author": "Leonard Lin", "ReviewID": "R2EDR9CZ0U0NFN", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I've been using the X100 as my main \"carry everywhere\" camera since receiving mine in May (sans several weeks where I sent it in for service and resent it back because Fujifilm service totally screwed up the original repair. They eventually made it right, but don't expect anything close to CPS level support). I've been shooting Canon DSLRs for over a decade, and have gone through way too many point and shoots from just about every major manufacturer in that same time (Nikon, Canon, Sony, Fujifilm, Leica/Panasonic, Samsung). I'd increasingly succumbed to the convenience of phone-shooting, but the X100 really caught my eye when it was announced as something that could deliver much-better-than P&S; quality in a much-smaller-than DSLR package. Since then, I've shot a few thousand frames (including a few that I liked).In summary, the X100 is a fantastic piece of equipment, however it's also (as the price hopefully hints at) a bit of a specialty camera. It requires a fair amount of commitment to figure out its sharp edges and peculiarities (of which there are many). I'd specifically *not* recommend the X100 if you're planning on using it for casual/social use. If you are, prepare to miss a lot of shots. It has meh HD video and (also meh) sweep panorama, but you won't bother with those as switching modes is a pain and a half and not why you'd get this camera. Also, while it's being marketed to pros, if you've been spoiled by modern DSLRs, prepare for decidedly non-pro responsiveness/speed/battery life/and absolutely yes, AF. The X100 was a particularly big adjustment for me because I prefer to shoot natural/low light (wide open) medium close ups (of people), and the X100's CDAF performs beyond miserably for that combo.Now, that's a very big list of caveats, and yet, I describe the X100 as \"fantastic\" and am giving it 4 stars. Unlike some, I'm not an apologists for the X100's weaknesses. There really are some really bad things (most of the firmware comes to mind), however, the X100 does some things *so* well that it overshadows most of its negatives (as long as you're aware of them).First and foremost, the X100 really does deliver on the IQ front. The APS-C sensor is fantastic; completely usable at ISO 1600, and even decent at 3200 (although very ugly banding sometimes crops up in higher ISOs). The 23mm (35mm equiv) lens is super smooth (great bokeh), and tack sharp (f4 and up). The lens/sensor combo gives you depth of field you won't find this side of a DSLR, and the fantastically silent leaf shutter is something you won't find on any DSLR, full stop. Out of camera colors are great; color balance and exposure are usually spot on. I shoot always shoot RAW+JPG, but these days am quite happy w/ OOC JPGs 90% of the time. If you do shoot RAW, I'd recommend you shoot with the fastest card as you can (this year, it's been the  SanDisk Extreme Pro 45MB/s cards) as the files are huge (20MB each).  Also the card speed actually affects all operations, including turn-on time. (I mentioned the firmware was crap, yes?) Also I shoot single, not burst mode as you can't perform adjustments while it's buffering. (...)The other big feature worth pointing out is the amazing optical viewfinder (OVF).  As a hybrid, it allows switching to a decent EVF (good resolution and brightness, but rather mediocre framerate) which can help w/ framing/fine-focusing, but you won't want to use it because the OVF is just too pretty. It also sports some high-tech projection capability, overlaying realtime data, including parallax-corrected framing guides, and more importantly, the range guide.  There's no focal screen/patch of any sort, so the range guide on the bottom is going to be invaluable when you're shooting - not for MF, which is pretty much useless, but to let you know when the AF is completely wrong.  The range guide includes (conservative) DOF ranges which makes it also extremely useful for zone-focusing. When zone-focused, the X100 is extremely responsive (although even w/ all settings to manual and OVF only, the aperture still inexplicably \"dances\" when releasing the shutter. This is worse in *bright* light).Ultimately, what makes X100 so special, despite its flaws, and beyond any individual feature, is that the X100 delivers a very satisfying and authentic photographic experience that's missing in most lesser cameras. The X100 is a photographic tool that you can really master/bond/immerse yourself with. The retro design is more than skin deep, and MF excepted, by and large delivers the tactile controls (aperture, shutter, EV dials) that, along w/ the OVF really does just get out of the way when you're shooting. In my day to day use, I am almost never touching the screen (in fact, I've had it gaffed over in prep for an international trip, and it hasn't been an issue at all). Granted some more fn buttons would be useful (I'd probably use the ND more, but I'd rather avoid the menus, which like the rest of the firmware are... not good). Also, sadly, there is no physical ISO dial.Tip: For the first few months I shot in Manual w/ the AF-L to focus. Because of the way MF is designed however (to be zoomed/fine-focused w/ the EVF), the focus area is much larger/less precise than in AF. These days I mostly shoot in AF-S (which also has a parallax corrected focus area option) w/ AF-L set to toggle. This seems to be generally more effective, although with some caveats: MF mode will focus much closer than AF-S, which while improved, still sucks (this is sometimes a problem in regular social/candid shooting situations). Also, even w/ the AE/AF-L set to AF-L only, the current (v1.11) FW will still improperly AE-L as well when in toggle mode. What this means is that you have to unlock even to be able to manually change the aperture/shutter.", "Date": "December 12, 2011"}, {"Title": "This is a camera you may want to keep FOREVER", "Author": "Radio Man \"yarns13\"", "ReviewID": "R239ZHJ31J840S", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I wasn't going to write a review on this X100 as it has been reviewed so many times already so what can I really add? I just don't understand some of the 1, 2, 3 star reviews here. Yes as said a million times here the X100 is rather quirky. But at the end of the day, when you stop PLAYING with your camera twiddling dials, this Fuji will give you pictures that will simply blow you away they are so good. I am not a pro photographer but a big time lover of photography and I admit to being a bit of a gear head. I presently own a Pentax K-5, Just sold my Nikon D-7000, have a Nex5N and...well I'll stop there. I mention those cameras because out of all of them at the end of the day...NOTHING comes close to my X100 in final output..as to IQ, \"color accuracy,\" !!!! HIGH ISO performance...just picture after picture where I say WOW. This X100 stands alone for high ISO low noise it's simply incredible! ISO 2000 has lower noise than my D7000 and K5 had at ISO 1250. One reason I am writing this review is I get more IN focus pics from this X100 than the D7000 or K-5. Yes the X100 is not going to be your camera for really fast action like sports I admit that. But for portraits, landscapes..things that don't move 100 miles an hour..this X100 is in it's own league. For the most part skin tones are INCREDIBLY accurate and beautiful on this camera. It's so dead on it's almost scary. My Pentax K-5 has to be tweaked after every picture YET it's one of the highest rated DSLRS out there but it can't compete with the X100 on color.NOT EVEN CLOSE! Again as to focus do people realize this \"x100 has a VERY useful DISTANCE SCALE?\" If you look at it you almost have to get IN focus pictures. In other words, if your subject is about 5 feet away, but the scale reads about 15 feet you already know the x100 is focusing PAST your subject. This little tool alone will save you from out of focus shots. My wife was trying to put my x100 safely away while on our kitchen table into a VERY small camera bag I had just bought for it. Long story short my first x100 missed the camera bag fell 3 feet onto a hard tile floor BOUNCED..landed like a brick. Only damage was a slightly dented lens cap. The camera was still perfect!!  Again with my wife (she's dangerous with cameras  :) ) she borrowed it to shoot some stuff in our backyard. She got startled by a bee and dropped the poor Fuji right on it's lens onto the grass..big thump. Again...after a cold sweat..I checked it out it's still perfect.WOW! Point being this thing is built like a tank it's so high quality. Knowing it had two major falls it bothered me. I gave it to another family member as a gift and it's still perfect. I bought a second one..well it's perfect and I'll be keeping my wife away from this one. :)I'm off track, my point was it's build quality puts in in a class of it's own just amazing QUALITY and craftsmanship. One con that has been discussed is the manual focus..yeah it's not really that great..well it's bad. But I just don't use manual focus much and frankly I like the auto-focus because all my shots come out....well FOCUSED and sharp..maybe I'm a lucky one here?As to the menu I hear people bashing...I don't get it, it's so easy to navigate..what's the problem??? The long story short if you can live with a few quirks this camera can BLOW YOU AWAY with it's pictures. At the end of the day when all you want are GREAT pictures..this Fuji is the camera to get!!!

I used to ALWAYS have a camera with most. Most often, it was an old Nikkormat with a single prime lens on it. Something light enough to wear around the neck all day, but that would have good performance for people shooting, low light, and just about anything.When I couldn't deal with film anymore, moving to P&S; cameras took away most of the speed, making it much harder to capture the moments that matter, but it was worth it to me since I could still shoot like crazy. When I finally went digital SLR with the 5D, I had everything I wanted, except for the bit about being able to carry the camera all day. A 5D with a single prime lens is still a neck breaker, and not so inconspicuous.I went to Canon G-series P&S; with the G9, and found it a happy medium. Pretty good images, decent speed. I could handle it like an old rangefinder, though it wasn't quite speedy enough or accurate enough (the viewfinder shows bupkis) to work that way.(I know, this is getting long. Bear with me, or don't...)I held out for a G1X recently. Big mistake. It handles more slowly than the g9, and though the chip takes gorgeous images, the negatives on handling and focus drove me nuts in short order. In desperation, while on vacation, ruing the fact that I wasn't able to get the images I wanted with the new canon, I popped into a store that had the x100 in the window. Within a few minutes I knew this was the camera I was looking for.Yes, I'd read all the reviews about the quirks, but honestly, what matters most to me are being able to put a reasonably sized camera to my eye, get enough info to make the shot, and have the shutter release when I hit the button. The x100 delivers on that in a way that nothing else in the class does, and at 1/3 the size and weight of a comparable-quality SLR. (Without the dust issues those bring to the table, too.)If you are a photographer of moments, this is the little companion you want. If you are someone who shoots nothing but stills, landscapes, and people who are holding still for you, mugging for the camera, then you might want the G1x instead.EDIT-------------------------------More time with this camera, and it just gets better. I feel like a photographer again for the first time since I went all digital (outside of when I have the boat-anchor SLR around my neck, I mean). This camera has been my constant companion and I'm blown away by how the simple, old-school controls are done right. Most important is the shutter release. It's as instant as any camera I've ever used. It's better than almost any digital, and feels faster than even high-end digital SLRs, perhaps because there's just no mirror to move. Because you can actually use the viewfinder and pin the body to your head, you're much steadier, meaning that you can shoot at 1/4 of a second again and get shots without camera-motion blur. Add in the fast lens, and this thing is a low-light monster, expanding working conditions and mood-exploration back into ranges of darkness that no digital point and shoot can handle.The images remain amazing, even the stuff shot at 1600 ISO.The single-focal distance lens has reinforced something I know, but sometimes forget, which is to move. Zooms can make you very lazy, and you miss a lot of alternate compositions by staying still and letting the lens get you where you think you need to go. Getting reaquainted with your feet will do a lot for your picture taking.If you are looking for a machine that captures all the simple elegance of old-school gear combined with only the best of current tech, this really is the camera to get.", "Date": "April 8, 2012"}, {"Title": "Best in class, but not perfect", "Author": "Nick", "ReviewID": "REDLYTZ7VIUZI", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "This review is from the point of view of someone using Nikon bodies. I've also used m43 cameras (GF-1 with 20mm and EP-1 with 17mm), and my pocket camera is the Canon S90. First - the reason why I bought the X100. I wanted an operationally good camera with decent image quality. This wouldn't be my take anywhere camera (S90 fills that spot), but it would be my first choice if I leave the house with the intent of taking pictures, and if I wasn't paid for doing so.Positives (in order of importance):- Nice image quality. On par or better than my Nikon D90. At low ISO settings - the colors are noticeably richer than what I can get from my Nikons (I shoot RAW, process in Lightroom)- Primary controls and shooting flow don't get in the way of shooting. I've even used the X100 for a wedding with very good results.- With a good fast card and all the battery saving settings turned off, the camera is quite responsive in normal operation. By this I mean - I change shutter speed / aperture and then press the shutter, the camera takes the picture. Secondary settings are another story - see below under negatives.- Extremely silent operation. If you don't have the camera close to your face, you won't hear the shutter.- 1/4000 sync speed. I can't say enough good things about this. You can buy a small flash (like Sunpak PF20XD), and overpower the sun with it at 1/4000. No other camera under ten grand can do this.- Nice build construction, nice looksNegatives (in order of importance):- AF performance is available darkness is below average. The camera will shoot regardless whether focus was achieved or not, which compounds the problem. Even with the focus assist lamp on, the rate of keepers never goes higher than 70%. Don't use this at night, unless you are prepared to zone focus. In all fairness, GF1 and the EP-1 were in the same boat. These CDAF cameras still have to learn how to achieve good focus in low contrast or low light situations.- Some secondary shooting settings - such as changing the AF point or switching between OVF / EVF / LCD have to wait for writing to card to complete. This is worse for slower cards.- The grip (fake leather looking plastic) is slippery. Also - the grip bump is too small for hand holding for extended periods of time. Prefer the EP-1 ergonomics there.- Not enough customizable controls, some secondary controls either useless or underutilized. I could use direct access to ND filter, custom modes and flash settings.- Having to switch to macro mode if you want to focus within 2 feet. This is a wide angle lens people - you're supposed to get close and focus close. Again - the camera will shoot even without achieving focus, so you won't be able to tell that you're too close until it's too late.- Image playback won't remember the last reviewed image. If you're in detailed view mode (to see the histogram), you can't delete the image - you have to go back to normal display mode. This makes reviewing shots in camera a lot harder than it should be.- Having to switch the external flash mode on/off. The flash hot shoe has contacts, Fujifilm; you can use them to tell if something is on that hotshoe or not, don't make me dig through the menus.- No manual settings for the built in flash. The camera decides the power and all you can do is dial the flash exposure compensation. This requires a trip through the menus.- Accessing the AF points is harder than it should be, and it's really not made for `no look' operation when you have your camera to your eye.- No close of the shutter flash sync (for focal plane shutters, this would be second curtain sync)- Manual Focus is useless. This is not a hyperbole, it is so bad that someone should really get fired over this. The ring is so slow that you'll grow a beard before you can get to your desired focus distance. Once you're there, the camera won't really assist you with fine focus (e.g. confirm acquiring focus somehow or magnified view on touching the focus ring).- In Manual mode, the histogram is not accurate.- Some settings change with each mode - most prominently ISO.None of the negatives are major for me. They are all annoyances. Once I `learned' the camera, I hardly notice them. All in all - this is better than all the other cameras in this class that I have tried.Quick comparison with other cameras I use(d).Vs Panasonic GF-1/ Olympus EP-1: Much better image quality, much quieter. GF-1 was better at focusing in low light and some of the controls were more logical. EP-1 was worse for shooting ergonomics.Vs Canon S90: Much better image quality, much faster in operation. S90 is considerably smaller - very pocketable.Vs Nikon D90: Slight edge to X100 for IQ. D90 is a much faster camera and with better shooting ergonomics, but also much bigger.Vs Nikon D700: D700 is better in every way, except for the flash high sync speed and size.", "Date": "May 24, 2011"}, {"Title": "Outstanding Image Quality, Accurate Colors and Good Performance", "Author": "Bryan Wayne", "ReviewID": "R1DVOUJE35WHEU", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I'm a hobbyist who was attracted to the X100's retro design, hybrid viewfinder and solid build but my decision to purchase the camera was based on it's superior image quality, true-to-life colors and shooting performance.  The camera's color performance cannot be overstated - it's remarkable even under difficult mixed indoor lighting.  Its outdoor color performance is equally excellent even with strong UV light, reflective light, backlighting, and color casts.In regard to lighting, the X100's built-in flash may be it most understated feature.  It compliments almost all lighting conditions and delivers natural color and balanced tones.  The flash acts more as a fill than as a primary light source.  It blends equally well with mixed light, direct sunlight and low light.  Also, the flash has excellent reach of up to 50 feet, and it enables nighttime photography of any subject within range that can be seen with the naked eye.Shooting performance is also very good - there is no shutter lag.  While not as fast as a dSLR, I've been able to shoot action - swimming and pole vaulting - again with accurate color rendition.  Swim events can be difficult to photograph because of harsh lighting, shadows, color casts, and movement.  The camera's \"normal\" JPEG mode provides excellent images and shooting JPEG rather than RAW greatly increases performance.  While I'm not against shooting RAW, I greatly prefer the speed, size, and convenience of JPEG files.Overall, the camera is a pleasure to hold and use.  The primary controls are responsive and their placement is ideal although the secondary controls, i.e. Command Control, Command Dial and Menu/OK button could be better.  The Menu/OK button needs to be larger and the Control Dial should be replaced with four buttons.  The current dial is sloppy.  Also, the Command Control which has a nice tactile feel serves little purpose as it's currently configured but could easily be made much more useful with a firmware update.  For instance, allowing it to be configured as an optional Menu/OK button would resolve the problem with the size of the current button.  Also, a simple firmware update would make the manual focus ring more responsive and practical.Lastly, there are several useful and reasonably priced accessories for this camera.  Ken Rockwell has an excellent suggestion for an inexpensive lens cover alternative using two reverse mounted 49mm filters (see his website).  AC MAXX has a quality universal 2.8\" LCD protector and there are excellent low-cost two piece leather cases which are useful both in the field and for safe storage.  Also, Digipower makes a fast travel charger which allows you to leave the supplied charger, with it's easy to loose plastic spacer, at home along with the nicely made but easy to loose lens cover.  All of these items can be found on Amazon.I highly recommend the X100 to photography enthusiasts and believe that its manufacturer's list price is reasonable.  However, I would not recommend the camera to \"point and shoot\" photographers who are dependent on pre-sets and don't have the patience or desire to learn photography fundamentals.", "Date": "July 10, 2011"}, {"Title": "Take the time to learn the camera", "Author": "Joe Z", "ReviewID": "ROLDR9T2ZMV3K", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "To start, I have two Canons, two Nikons, two Fujis on my shelf (many more of each have passed through my life). Each is different. Each lends itself to different shooting styles/preferences. Canon is more intuitive to me. Nikon is, well, Nikon, so I have a couple of those just because I like 'em. Fuji makes cool cameras that I've had to learn to use. The X100 is one of those cameras you have to learn to use.Some question the ease of use based on price. More expensive should be easier, right? I've driven a Ferrari and I've driven a Ford Escort. Ford wins when it comes to ease of use - gets me from point A to point B, warm and dry at well over the legal speed. I do not have the skills to get the most out of a Ferrari.

Each outing brings better results.)So let's ignore reviews from folks who still think disposable, fixed, f11, 35mm film cameras are a real photographic alternative.I'm not going to get into the technical what all. The bottom line is that the camera takes geat pictures if you learn to use it within its limitations. (And, no, lack of a zoom is not a limitation. Sheesh!) Visit any legit photog site and the camera gets rave reviews. The quibbles are just that: quibbles, nit-picking by people who have too much time on their hands stuck in front of a computer monitor.

I also considered the Leica X1 which I had used for a week but happily chose the X-100. I have been partial to Leica and my wife shoots automotive stills for three car magazines with Leica. The X-100 comes very close to Leica output. The X-100 is probably not a great consideration if you are looking for a point and shoot camera. The fixed focal length will make you think about the image composition more so than a camera with zoom lens. The menu system is a little funky but should not be a reason not to own this outstanding camera. Yes it's retro-looking and it's definitely not a rangefinder. I rarely use the LCD to compose photos. Most composition done through the optical viewfinder (OVF) or the selectable electronic viewfinder (EVF). For \"street shooting\" it's wonderful. Very unobtrusive. While some people shy away or object being photographed with a DSLR, they rarely object being photographed with the X100. Maybe it's the \"retro\" look. I have no reason to use my DSLR again for street photography. The lens resolution and image quality of the X100 is as good as the output from the Zeiss prime lenses on the DSLR. There are three B&W; options that are quite useful that I haven't seen with other digital cameras. While several new digital cameras have higher resolutions than 12.3 MP, the IQ of this rivals the Leica cameras (well, maybe not an M9) or other digital cameras with higher resolution. The proof of the image quality is the printed image. Most of the output is printed in large format prints.I've read some complaints from others about batter life. I haven't experienced that.

In many ways it matches the human visual system's characteristic in high contrast and low light scenes.Those who love working a 35 or 50mm prime lens will have a blast with this.  Those without will learn to work more creatively.After having this for a couple of weeks, I am very impressed with the photos this camera takes. It has a nice F2.0 lens (fixed, 35mm equivalent) and is obviously very retro in style.  I like they way the viewfinder senses you putting your eye up to the camera and puts the EVF up (and can also go all-optical in the rangefinder viewer)What I like:* has a 400% dynamic range setting which does a very good job of preventing blowouts in the highlights and shadows.  This has to be seen to be believed, but it reminds me very much of the dynamic range of color film, which I have greatly missed.* Good pics even at ISO 12,000!  The x100 at 6400 has less noise than my Nikon at 800. You can shoot handheld in moonlight.* I almost never use flash, but this little camera does it right, faces look warm and never blow out.* The manual controls and auto-ISO.  Get things set the way you like and start shooting.* really low latency (instant?) on rear-screen and electronic viewfinder. Also a rangefinder style all-optical path.* much lighter than my SLR, but same or better picture quality at 35mmWhat I use it for:* Indoor/Outdoor candid photos in low light* High contrast shots, dynamic range abilities must be seen to be believed.  This camera reliably captures at least 12 stops.* a dedicated exposure compensation dial* walkabout. lens is tack sharp.  Use your feet to zoom* \"sweeping panorama\" shots are good enough in a pinch to replace a 17mm wide angle shot* Intentional shooting, where you know what you want in the image and how to compose the shot, this camera will capture a sharp image with great dynamic range, like color or B&W; film have been doing for a hundred years.What I don't like:* macro mode should be automatic, the threshold between requiring macro (which does 10cm) and normal close focus is about arms-length.  When you're close its annoying to have to switch as you see it focus-hunt.* menu system is a little unwieldy, but 3 sets of custom settings help.This is a fantastic \"second camera\" for the semi-pro.

It is much more portable than DSLR, have great selection of lens and produce nice images. (Actually, I think m4/3 is very nice for one who looking for versatile camera with lens replacement).But there were two reasons why I bought X100. M4/3 camera system was a bit less than \"impressive\". Not bad design, not bad image quality, etc but I was not able to feel the love, the love similar to what I had with Pentax 40mm limited lens several years ago. The other reason was, maybe some people would laugh, but m4/3 with extra lens were still bulky for me to carry outside.X100 is great camera. Yes, it have fixed focal length. Yes, its autofocus sometimes struggles. (Many of the complaints fixed with firmware update thus I do not have any complaints on the user interface or firmware anymore).The important thing is, it takes picture - the pictures are beautiful and impressive. I have another superzoom camera to fulfill my \"I need zoom\" desire, but to express my satisfaction on my X100, I'll give you two example.(1) After I took picture, I review it in PC and delete, keep or put as favorite. X100 have highest ratio to make picture as favorite compared to any of my previous camera.(2) My wife call X100 as \"fake\" camera, because when I take picture of my children, then she check the result and says \"Another fake picture.

Yes I do own this camera and I would want to say that writing something positive on this doesn't mean I need some sort of remedy for post purchase anxiety.  I have had bad stuff before and would recommend against it just to help others not to make the same mistakes.  So here goes:Why Buy This?- You like DSLR image quality that comes with top notch Lens (translation: Nikkor professional range and Canon's L Lens)- You wouldn't like to bring that D3s for a family trip- You loved the way Fujifilm is able to bring vivid colour out of your prints (velvia)- You love skin tones. Lotsa skin tones. Portrait machine it is.- Sick of menus, love \"to-the-point\" controls via knobs instead of button mashing- You are a night shooter, but hate the tripod- Pixel peeping is your hobby- Hate ISO noise to the core- Hate to do too much post processing. You'd rather go out to take shots.  The JPEG out of this camera is simply defying the use of Photoshop.- Panorama is your thang but you just don't want to do it using a DSLR and a lot of post processing.  This x100 do full size image of Pano.- Not exactly a HDR tool but the dynamic range is good enough not to do too much of HDR- You take your time to compose your shots by thinking through aperture, shutter, exposure. You love to see how a picture would turn out in your mind before putting the eye to the camera. Your are a composer of the imagery sense.- You love to be a modern luddite. Yes I sense an oxymoronic moment.Why Don't Buy This?- You love to do everything automatic, including finding a focus point.- You love to take action shots, taking multiple/continuous shots of your objects. Even when the cat is sleep.  The camera will take time to record those images.- You hate walking towards your subject. Heck you just hate walking - let the Lens do the walking (isn't that a tag line for yellowpages?)- You love controlling the camera through menus.  The menu is horrific on the x100.- You love manual focusing. The x100 is focusing by the wire.- Macro is something you love. This ain't macro machine.- You just hate spending time learning how to use the thing.- You hate reading manuals- You hate to update firmware (yes the x100 desperately need an update of the firmware to solve the quirky menu issue)- You just don't have the money to spend (opps..that is so obvious..:P)Summary: It IS a good camera. A camera is something that helps you to capture an image for posterity and it does it well.  Now is it hard to use this to take a picture?  The focusing may be an issue to some but generally it does its job, even in not so well lit places.  But once you get over how to get the x100 to focus, the picture that comes out of it untouched is something you would cherish.  Would I buy another x100 to replace the one I had?  No I won't get it. I will buy the x200 if it has the same pedigree as the x100.  It IS that good.The good news?  If you have sold the camera then I would say a regret is coming your way (according to dpreview) when the firmware upgrade reached the innards of this camera.  It won't be a miracle cure but usability would be enhanced.Point: If there are people out there who can take great pictures despite the bad issues, then what gives?Nuff said.

Fuji image quality and a ASP-C sensor is what I wanted and I wasn't disappointed.As I said, this camera, in my old hands at least, is FULLY AUTOMATIC!To wit:I automatically tell myself that I will need to slow down and check all of my settings before shooting, just like in the film days.When preparing to go shooting with the x100  I automatically grab the two extra batteries I bought. I leave the camera on but kill the display between photos.When I pull her out of her case, I automatically slip my hand through the wrist strap.I turn on the power and automatically remove the lens cap and place it in my left pocket. Yes, I use the lens cap always and have yet to use a filter over that fine Japanese glass.I love the O/D viewfinder and automatically select the one that is right for the conditions.Most of the time, I automatically set exposure compensation to -1/3 to protect the highlights but always check the histogram before shooting.I know the limitations of this camera. It does not like to be rushed.It is not a #$@%& iPhone but I have re-learned what knowledge I painfully acquired from my thirty years of shooting film. I try not to chimp too much and trust the Force.I try to really think things through and spend more time and fewer megabites on light, composition, DOF, etc.The results are amazing when I am not in a hurry.Fill-in flash is almost perfect in most situations.

It's the closest thing to a digital M camera with 35mm lens, at a much lower price. While it certainly does not replace my DSLR, it complements it nicely especially as a street photography camera and 'go anywhere' camera. I turned off the shutter sound and it is nearly silent, enabling me to get publishable shots in more places than I could with my DSLR.It also looks very retro and reminds me of a Leica M3 or Canonet-quite stylish and swanky indeed.Image quality is excellent as is high ISO performance. The bokeh at f2.0 also has a great quality due in part to the large sensor. 720p video quality is also excellent but when filming with the camera on a tripod or stationary, I have found it works best to set the focus manually. Otherwise, while videoing, the focus can hunt which is noticeable when watching the video. Also, this adds a bit of noise to the audio as well.I'm knocking off one star because I think this camera is slightly over-priced for what it is. While it does feel quite sturdy in terms of build quality, it could even be better in that regard. I think if this camera were $1,000. that would be a price point I would feel better about.Also, the menu system is a bit quirky and takes time to get used to. I'm used to it now and know where everything is and what to press, etc... Also the menu button is in the middle of the rear dial and a bit too small.

Nguyen", "ReviewID": "R2WUU44EHTH3FK", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I've had this camera for about a year now and I'm sure most people have heard about it and have read tons of in-depth reviews. I just want to give a quick pros and cons for those who are debating between this camera, a dslr, or waiting for the x-pro 1. I used to shoot with a Canon T1i so I'm focused on photogs that are entry or intermediary  level. I love this camera to death but I really want others to really know what they're getting into when they buy it.Pros:1. Compact - I have more urges to grab my small camera bag (which could be mistaken for a murse) everywhere I go.2. Quiet - Great for discreet street photography. People definitely are less likely to notice this camera vs. a dslr.3. Fixed lens - Fast, sharp and wide. Great for low lighting and group photos.4. Low noise - Definitely beats anything in it's price class. Even when there is more noticeable noise (3200 and up) it's more like film grain.5. White balance - The way this camera handles color puts some dslr to shame.6. Looks - Pretty freakin' gorgeous. I get a lot of people coming up to me and asking about it. Many mistaken it for a Leica.7. Features - Viewfinder! ND filter, film simulation, 720p movie recording, 1/4000th sec flash sync, macro-ish, panoramic and burst modes. All very useful.8. Picture quality - Will wow you every time.9. Dials - I definitely like having the dials. It feels much better if you shoot only in manual mode like me.Cons:1. Menu - Unintuitive. Still forget where things are sometimes.2. Manual focus - Fly by wire focus is awful. You could use the focus lock button or might as well just stick with AF.3. Auto focus - Sometimes slow and not always accurate. There are tricks to help, but come on, focusing is pretty basic.4. Fixed lens - I miss being able to zoom in close sometimes when the occasion arises.5. Dust - Gets in your viewfinder. Drives me nuts.6. Not more scratch resistant - The silver part of the camera scratches pretty easily. For a $1200 camera that's just sad. I've had plastic cameras that are still in mint condition.7. Exposure compensation dial - Easily gets moved without you noticing and you could end up taking 20-30 shots with unintentional exposures.8. 12 MP - Just not enough especially when you're using a wide-angle lens and most of the time you will want to crop.Conclusion:It will be a love and hate relationship. This camera is definitely better than the other mirrorless cameras out there and any entry level dslr. That is if picture quality is your main concern. If you want to be more versatile with your focal length but still have it compact then look at other mirrorless cameras. But none of their lenses will match the one attached to the Fuji. If you love to manual focus, have fast accurate auto focus, and can't live without the through-the-lens perspective, then go with the dslr. You'll just be missing out on very low noise and beautifully colored photos. If money is not an issue, I would wait for the X-Pro 1. It solves many of the negative points of the X100. I think what excites me most is that the X-pro 1 is supposed to have better image quality, has 16MP for those large prints and interchangeable lenses. It would really be like having a pro-level dslr without the crazy prices and bulk. It's not cheap but just a little bit more obtainable for the everyday prosumer. The only part I dread is the fly by wire manual focus, but I hope the AF will be greatly improved like Fuji claims. But all I know for sure is having an X100 makes me drool when I look at the X-pro1.

I like it so much I sold my dslr and 3 lenses. It's my only camera, a very unusual experience.  What follows is based on firmware 1.30.Some pointers/suggestions:If you have little knowledge of photography the X100 is not a great place to start. It's complicated, a bit rough around the edges and not all that flexible with a fixed lens.  Rough edges are an underpowered processor, undocumented ways to get around some of the camera's issues (autofocus), pitiful battery life and a poor menu/controls setup for a few key settings (like iso). If you machine gun shots, this is not the camera for you. The buffer's too small and the battery too small.  Inconsistent start times from sleep.  Its a function of remaining battery life for sure, as well as other stuff that appears to get in the way.  I don't let the camera sleep as on/off gives a start time that's consistent.  When rushed, the camera can get a bit weird.  Pop the battery and you're up again.  I use a 95mbps card. I doubt if you can go much slower.  The lens hood is over priced and sort of stinks. It blocks the af assist light and the slot supports on mine line up exactly where I need to see through the slot (the JJC hood did a fine job of copying Fuji's as their slot supports are in the same place.  Stacked empty filter rings are better.X100 strong points:For the money, build and materials quality is excellent.  The lens is very good. You can easily spend more on worst lenses that this entire camera costs. f2 is soft, 2.8 is good, above that it's superb.  The lens is a bit dark in the corners. ACRs lens profile takes care of it -- most people won't even notice it.  While AF is not dslr fast, it's quicker than its telling you. You do not need to wait for focus confirmation. Simply press the shutter in one continuous press and you're in focus (except in macro where you need confirmation as it can hunt).  I believe the lag is related to the slow refresh rate of the evf/rear display and the ovf's confirmation is tied to that chain of events.  AF accuracy is superb. It took me a bit of time to get used to the camera and I certainly had some out of focus shots during the first week or two. But since then, af is virtually always spot on.  It can hunt in low light but a single tiny move of the focus spot will usually get focus. It's certainly less hunting than fast glass on my Nikons.  Superb low light/high iso performer.  Many appear to have focus issues in low light.  I do not and I do a lot of low light shooting (AF-S, nothing special).  Lovely in hand.  Outstanding IQ. Outstanding out-of-camera jpeg's. It took me months to wean myself off RAW but I'm finally there and shoot jpeg only (Astia in my case).  I use the RAW button in lighting situations where I believe I may want bits and bytes.  For jpeg, I use auto iso and auto DR.I'm a somewhat deliberate shooter who has always shot with wide lenses. I also value small and light.  For me the X100 is a great tool.

Finney", "ReviewID": "R2TJD76CFIFH90", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "I waited for this camera for an entire year, since the concept camera came out last September. If ever there should be a \"fan boy\" of the x100, it SHOULD be me, but sadly it is not. Ill point out who I think this camera is for, and who it is NOT for.There are literally thousands of reviews that all highlight the same awesome traits about this camera which are all pretty much spot on, so I wont waste any one's time reiterating them in detail. Instead, I will point out why I am returning my x100. Also, I am running the latest firmware as of Sept 2011: v1.10.At first glance this camera is pretty brilliant considering its size and looks. When it works, pictures are very sharp, and it films nicely as well. The manual feel of the dials is a nice throwback that I have missed for a long time. Its a great conversation piece and people seem to love it....And sadly this is where the fairytale ends, because as you work your fingers towards the front of the camera and place them on the \"focusing ring\" (if you can even call it that) the horror starts. Most cameras with a manual focus ring require one QUARTER of a turn (90 degrees) to go from near focus to infinity. Keep that in mind. My x100 counted EIGHT AND A HALF full 360 degree rotations to do the same! A humans wrist can only turn about 180 degrees so if if you stick your hand in front of the camera looking like an idiot it will require SEVENTEEN turns to get from one end of the focal range to the other!! I own and have owned a lot of cameras and I have never come across something this insane or tedious.Sadly the insanity does not stop with the manual focus ring. The auto focus in lower light is unacceptable. In a somewhat decently lit restaurant I tried for roughly an hour over dinner to photograph my friends and the food. The auto focus failed again and again and again. Even with the obnoxious flash auto focus assist blinding my friends, it still wouldnt work. Trying the same feature with the food using standard and then macro mode yeilded the same terrible results. My camera on my phone performed better at focusing! I dont care what this camera is supposedly intended for, at 1200 USD it needs to focus in lower light better than a 200 dollar camera and SHOULD focus better than everything inbetween.Half the owners of this camera have brought up online how horrid the focus system is and Ive been hearing fan boys argue \"you arent using the camera right\" or \"you dont know what you're doing...\" etc. This is an absolute crock! I have multiple professional full frames SLRs, a range finder, a 6 year old compact point and shoot, and a camera phone and every single one of my cameras focus faster than this $1200 pretentious what-ever-its-supposed-to-be.I feel this camera is not for most people that want it and Ill explain why... If you want a camera that is light on its feet and not cumbersome like the DSLR you ALREADY own to take candids when you go out, this camera is probably NOT for you; the glacially slow and unreliable focus system will result in missed moments and tired friends posing for eternity. My success rate right now with out-and-about shooting candids is about 50/50 - when its not failing to focus the shots are brilliant.If you plan on only shooting in well lit areas with slow or not moving compositions, this camera COULD be for you, but why not just use a DSLR that has the option of multiple lenses and better user interface?If you want a very light camera for foot travel and like to take photos of still objects like buildings or rocks, and want to spend a lot of money, this camera is definitely for you. This is where this camera shines and holds its own against the DSLRsThese three groups DEFINITELY do not cover all photographers, but they should help illustrate my point. If you think you want this camera, or like me HAD TO HAVE IT, make sure you know that kind of photography it will be solely used for, because trying to take it out of its very limited safe zone will only lead to your own frustration.

The manual focus ring is completely useless. You need to be happy with a fixed lens that is the equivalent of a film 35mm lens. Things that make me happy: The shutter is nearly completely silent. It's a cute, friendly-looking camera, and doesn't freak out people like pointing a big DSLR with a giant lens would. The hybrid viewfinder is incredible. The ability to take low-light photos is fantastic, thanks to the high ISOs. The in-camera panorama function can do great things. (Hong Kong skyline after a typhoon not included with purchase.) I am completely in love with it, and can't wait to wander around my own city with it.As some people are fond of pointing out, you can do much much more with a Nikon D7000. It comes down to how you want to interact with the camera, much like how you want to interact with a car: Is a modern commuter box faster and more fuel efficient than a 70s Italian car? Yes. Will driving one put an unstoppable grin on your face, like driving a 70s Italian car? No. That is to say- the right person for this camera will love it to pieces. If not, well- there are thousands of cameras out there; pick one to suit your needs and stop borching about this one.The Fuji looks like a harmless 40-year-old film camera, if you don't look too closely. The mirror lockup on a DSLR can cause an entire conference room to turn and look at me- not a chance of that happening with the Fuji. I love this camera.Edited to add: If you buy this camera, and don't feel like springing for the Fuji hood/adapter-ring set, pick up a cheap 52-49mm step-down ring, like the one in the Fotodiox 7 Metal Step Down Ring Set, Anodized Black Metal. 77-72mm, 72-67mm, 67-62mm, 62-58mm, 58-55mm, 55-52mm, 52-49mm.

It does have quirks (one other post mentioned focusing with the OVF, but this is simply a quirk of optics when focusing on near objects--parallax). While the fixed 35mm equivalent lens will limit what you can shoot, it is almost a necessity for a small camera with a large sensor. Because of the fixed lens, I have found that I take more time in evaluating composition before the shot--a good thing.The latest firmware upgrade fixed many of the annoying operational issues of the camera.I had been waiting for a large-sensor camera with a fast lens and small form-factor and would have gone with the Panasonic GF-2 if Panasonic hadn't taken the wrong direction from the very nice GF-1.

I used to shoot Leica, because of it's size and quality but I became frustrated with low-light performance and lack of macro on the M8 platform.  So I sold my M8.2, and the lenses, and purchased the Fuji X100 for a trip to Japan.  I was initially a little flustered with the performance (as with all cameras you need to learn them first before committing to taking good images) but the images I got out of this camera were simply stunning.  The detail and color are fantastic, rivaling and even surpassing, what I got with my Leica M8.2 and a 35 f1.4 lens.Buy With Your Heart- Zoom With Your FeetYou choose this camera because you want to be as inconspicuous as possible (the shutter is nearly silent) and you have time to focus and compose an image.  This is not a camera for the point-n-shoot crowd, that's why Fuji made the X10 & X20.  This camera is for the aperture priority or shutter priority photographer who can live with one lens and \"zoom with their feet\".Form Factor- Styling & ColorThe only thing that bothered me about this camera was the body color.  I typically only buy black body cameras because people notice them a little less then silver or another colors.

The out of camera JPEG images are absolutely stunning, even at 3200 ISO, and are better in their color and tonality than my best Lightroom-tweaked images from the D90.

That, combined with the sharp, wide, fast lens should make it a great indoor shooter. The top controls and aperture ring are great. Exactly what I was expecting.But the x100 is let down by its focus. The auto focus in low light simply isn't good. Now, it's not awful, but it's not as good as other cameras (i.e. budget SLRs) in this price range. I know it's phase detection vs contrast issue. But I don't care by what method the thing focuses, I just want it to be faster and more accurate.However, the auto focus, even though it's not great, is leaps and bounds better than the manual focus. Simply put, the x100's manual focus is pathetic. I can't imagine it ever being useful. It's slow. Even with the 1.1 firmware it's super slow. I understand it's fly by wire, but that doesn't explain it's glacial speed. I could go on and on about the terrible manual focus - it's that bad.Also, I really don't care that much about the hybrid viewfinder. I leave it on optical the vast majority of the time. I dislike EVFs. Supposedly that x100s EVF is better than most, but I wouldn't know. The only time it'd be useful is for manual focus and we all know how I feel about that. You pretty much have to use the EVF and manual focus for macro. Personally, I think I'd just take a step back and hope I have enough detail to crop in post.The parallax issues are more of an issue than I thought they'd be. I'd never used a camera with an offset viewfinder before. Before I received my x100, I thought people online were needlessly complaining. It's definitely something to be aware of if you're shooting within a two or three feet. What you're focusing on may not be what you're truly focusing on. And your image will definitely shift from what you had framed. I don't think this is an issue with the x100 per se, just offset viewfinders in general.Minor complaints:The write speed is a little pokey. Even with a fast, 45 MB/s UHS-1 card be prepared to wait a good 5 seconds or more for the burst buffer to clear. The black, textured plastic isn't nearly as sumptuous as I thought it would be. It's just hard black plastic.If this camera had been $800, even with all the flaws I would have given it four stars. But for $1200 I expect a manual focus that is usable. For the x200, if Fuji fixes the manual focus, preferably a direct mechanical dial, and switches to phase detection for the auto focus, it would definitely be a five star camera.", "Date": "May 9, 2011"}, {"Title": "Phenomenal camera - (don't believe the 1-star reviews)", "Author": "tbuyer \"tbuyer\"", "ReviewID": "R1WTUQJM9OBLPD", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I've have been using the X100 for about 6 months now, and I thought about leaving some feedback about it.In my opinion, the main points about this camera are the following:1. It's a phenomenal camera2. It's a photographer's camera3. It's *not* a point-and-shoot4. It's a difficult and slow cameraI think the best way to describe this camera is as a \"photographer's camera\". By that I mean that it's a camera for someone who is into photography, that knows very well what (s)he is doing. If you are into photography and you really know how to take good pictures in *full* manual mode (and that includes external lighting) then you will know how to handle this camera.On the other hand, if you are not really into photography and you have to rely on auto modes (from full auto and \"scene\" modes, to Aperture priority, and including \"auto\" flash, then I anticipate a great deal of frustration with this camera.The X100 is slow to handle. Wake up, writing to card, focusing, and picture review, are all very slow (compared to most DSLRs).However, the X100 delivers superb image quality. It's also a camera that you can slip into your pocket. It's perfect for photographer's holiday, and for candid shots.So that's the bottom-line: This camera is slow and difficult to handle, but it also delivers superb image quality if you know how to handle it. If you are an \"auto\" or \"semi-auto\" shooter, then this is not a camera for you.-------------------------------A note about the 1-star reviews-------------------------------When I came to post my review, I noted a few 1-star ratings. Intrigued, I had a look at them. I'm not going to go one by one, but they either are from people who don't own the camera, are reviewing the seller or the software, or complain about an issue that Fuji will fully fix if presented with your camera.

Its highly publicized quirks have been mostly dealt with via firmware updates.  It took a little getting used to, to be sure, but I love shooting with it, and am learning new things about its capabilities every time I shoot.The layout of the controls seems very natural and user friendly to me, I guess because of my manual SLR upbringing.  (Have been using the Olympus OM system since the OM2 was new and exciting).  On the X-100, it all just makes sense.  Want shutter priority?  Select your shutter speed and it's done.  Want aperture priority instead?  Just choose your aperture, and it's done.  It's that simple.  Of course you can go fully manual as well.  Set your shutter speed or aperture as needed, the viewfinder shows whether your exposure is correct or not, through the lens, just like in the old days.  Perfect.  Exposure compensation?  RIght on top, where it used to be.  About the only time you need to go menu diving is to pull up the ND filter, or to do auto-bracketing.  And you can assign two different buttons to your favorite menu items anyway, so you will rarely need to access the menu.  When you do, it is clear, simple, and intuitive.Everything on the X-100 works the way I expected, or better, except for the manual focus, which is not really usable.  The camera looks great, feels great, very solid.Because it is small and unobtrusive, it is easy to take candid shots on the street or in groups without interrupting the mood.  Non-photographers don't realize it's a serious camera, since it doesn't weigh 3 pounds and sport a bulky super-zoom.Go ahead and get the filter and hood adapter, an extra battery, and a fast SD card if you tend to shoot in \"burst\" mode.  I will probably get the lens hood too, as a few shots would have been easier without having to try to keep the sun out of the lens with my hand.Everyone who is serious about photography in my life stops me to talk about the X-100.

I'm used to point and shoot cameras and never into DSLRs. Despite the seemingly complicated buttons and features I find this camera easy to use. The pictures are amazing especially the colors. People are amazed at the quality of my pictures. A gallery owner even asked for copies of my shots because mine were better than the ones she took. This camera definitely made a lot of difference.Buying the black limited edition set at least ensures that I forego the hassle of buying a case and lens protector separately and this set is boxed securely.Given the price of this camera, I did my research, I heard there are cases of sticky aperture lenses on some of the earlier models. Buying the limited edition black set ensures you get the new production as the black limited editions are all manufactured at a later date wherein the issue has been solved.The silent shutter feature is also great as it enables me to capture plenty of candid moments without anyone being the wiser. This would be something those big luggy SLRs cannot offer and the images are just as good.Unlike my usual point and shoot camera this doesn't have zoom lens, so I would not recommend it for a trip to Africa but it's excellent for all other occasions than does not require zoom lens feature.The price tag would likely scare the casual photographer like myself and I initially had my doubts as well, but I was glad I took the risk to try it.

My main camera is currently a Canon EOS 7D with a number of L lenses. I travel frequently but am loathe to drag along the DSLR because of its bulk, the potential hassles at airport security and its value. I have tried a number of compact digital cameras (the last was a Canon G11) for this purpose but always felt let down by the image quality and limited by the lack of selective focus. The X100 with its frequently exquisite image quality, epic low light and high ISO performance, beautiful fast lens and excellent bokeh is a winning combination for me. Consider also its superb fill in flash performance, its high flash synch speed and built in ND filter and you have quite an exotic specification and capability in a small package. Finally, the X100 offers the much discussed optical/electronic viewfinder combination which really adds to the business of picture taking.Its important to note that all of the firmware and handling complaints noted in other reviews here are valid. However, with the latest firmware release -1.21, almost all of the deficiencies have been addressed in a very robust fashion (arguably transforming). On my X100 with V 1.21 firmware, focusing in strong and low light is fast and sure, new functions are assignable to the RAW and Fn buttons and overall camera operation is much quicker. This leaves only the price as a barrier to entry - if you treasure the ability to make fine images, the appeal of well made hardware and the possibility of taking it with you everywhere without a bulky bag or a Sherpa, then the decision becomes clearer. I have no reservations about this camera now and look forward to taking it everywhere. It's going up a volcano with me in three days where I will trust it with pictures not easily remade.With all that said, I would second the opinion of others, that this camera is probably most satisfying for deliberate photographers.

It isn't a do-all camera and for most people won't be flexible enough to become their one and only camera. Yet for some it may be the only camera they need. A conundrum?The X100 is capable of producing great, no, fantastic, image quality. Fujifilm did an excellent job pairing their EXR sensor with the lens in this camera. No complaints there at all.The camera control mechanisms have their quirks but these are no big deal and some of them can even be resolved with firmware updates. The one big failing the camera has with control features is the control-ring / OK button - the part Fujifilm chose to use is simply awful.Yes, the camera could push images to storage a little faster, and yes, it is annoying when you lose for a few seconds the ability to change settings while pumping out 3 raw captures. Annoying but not fatal in the least for most.Autofocus could be faster, but no big deal. What is a big deal here is the autofocus box for \"manual\" focus (manual triggering of autofocus) is far too large and isn't resizable like in AF-C or AF-S modes. This leads to focus errors. For operators like myself who prefer to assign the focus command to the AFL/AEL button rather than shutter half-press, this is very, very, annoying. Manual focus of the lens - the usual \"by-wire\" affair - is unsatisfying with this camera but the same is true of many AF cameras. Firmware updates have improved this situation dramatically.The EVF is good but not great, however it is good enough that if you need to depend on it for accurate framing, you'll use it. The OVF is fabulous, but doesn't offer accurate framing. At least you have a choice. I found myself using the Electronic View Finder more than the Optical.The lack of max shutter speed when shooting wide open is annoying but is a by-product of the leaf shutter design in the camera. At least Fujifilm provides a built in neutral density filter to compensate for this but I'd prefer to have max shutter speed myself. But... with the design it is a necessary trade off and you do get a near silent shutter as part of the bargain.The rest of it - higher ISO performance? Fantastic. Menu organization? So so.So what's the core problem?Sticky Aperture Blade syndrome. Cameras showing this problem have aperture blades that progressively fail to close to the desired aperture. Usually a X100 user discovers this because they've been shooting a scene, stop down the camera further, and discover as they stop down the scene gets progressively more and more over exposed.The failure creeps up on most X100's, being sporadic at first and then more and more regular and affecting more and more of the blade travel until finally the blades won't barely budge at all and you are left with a full time f/2.0 only camera. For most failure starts to happen, or be detected, between 500 and 1000 exposures but we've seen this occur sooner and later. Many inexperienced users will have this failure and not realize it for quite some time.Too many X100's are failing. You can't visit a photography forum where X100 shooters congregate without noticing that newcomers and old-timers alike are having their cameras fail. Not all cameras are failing - some are lucky. But sufficient numbers are failing for this to be an issue worth considering. The problem is a manufacturing defect at best, or a design defect at worst.The fix? Replacement of the entire lens assembly.First, the good news: Fujifilm covers the failure under warranty and world wide they are making an absolutely fantastic effort to repair and return X100s to their owners fast and at zero cost.Now the bad news: Based on feedback from Fujifilm users around the world, Fujifilm will not perform the warranty repair for anyone other than the original retail owner. The cost of the repair is somewhere between 750 and 850 dollars U.S. which is most of the cost of the camera new.Ok, is that so bad? Not if you are the original owner and not if you have no intention of ever, ever, selling the camera.But the X100 isn't for everyone and many try it and find they can't live with just one lens or some other aspect of this fine camera - and it is a fine camera, please do not think otherwise. There's nothing wrong with trying out a camera and deciding it isn't for you - the used market for X100's has had relatively firm pricing, but that pricing power is starting to erode for two reasons - X100's are becoming more available, and the sticky aperture blade issue.As yourselves this before purchasing the camera: do you know without doubt that you will keep this camera forever? If so, buy without fear. If you can't be sure, at least consider that potential buyers may be leery of purchasing a second hand X100 because they won't be able to get warranty support for the Sticky Aperture Blade problem. Any informed buyer of used X100's won't want to play the warranty lottery game.Fujifilm could fix this by making a global announcement covering this problem for all camera owners. Why aren't they? Are they depending on buyers to be ill-informed or un-organized? That could be a mistake in this internet-connected age.Would I buy the X100 again? Personally, no, but not because of the sticky blade issue. For my own purposes I would prefer an interchangeable lens version of the X100, and apparently Fujifilm will announce just that in 2012. It'll no doubt be more expensive than the X100 but I'm more than willing to pay up for that.If interchangeable lenses were not a requirement for me, yes, I'd buy the camera again.

My first thought was to pick up an X100 and give her my own point-and-shoot. Guess what?  As near as I could ever find, the only Fujifilm for sale in Manhattan was in a camera store in the Murray Hill neighborhood, where the shop keeper absolutely refused to sell it other than in a kit, with a card, an extra battery, auxilliary lenses and a selection of other schlock stuff I didn't want or need.  Hopefully, he still has it!The attractive things about the cmera, to me at least, are that it takes excellent photos, but you can make it as easy or as complex to use as you see fit. I find that I actually like the fixed focal length lens.  When I want to take a picture, I just lift the camera, compose, and shoot it.  It's easy enough in Photoshop to crop it to nicely frame the center of interest.  No sweat.I'd say that if you are looking at the X100 as your only camera, you might want to consider something with more features, such as the new Nikon 1, which I just bought for my aforementioned wife, who loves it.

I have an SLR camera, but the size & weight are not always convenient to carry everywhere. For convenience, I started carrying the Canon PowerShot G9, which gave me great results. However, the G9's small sensor wasn't good enough for the information I wanted to capture; The FUJIFILM FinePix X100 was exactly what I needed with it's compact size & larger sensor.Sensor & lens (+): The APS-C sensor, which is (almost) the same size as the Nikon DX sensor, giving a crop factor of x1.5.. The X100 has a fixed 23mm f/2.0 lens, with the crop factor it becomes equivalent to 35mm. Perfect for most of your everyday compositions, especially if you're a fan of shallow depth of field like me :)Noise (+): My old SLR can go to a maximum of ISO-1600, which isn't very convenient in low light conditions. The X100 supports ISO from 200-6400 in RAW format, and can be boosted to 12800 in JPEG format.. But I'm sure those who like the RAW format, won't even consider JPEG.. Regardless of your choice, the noise reduction technology is absolutely wonderful (posted some samples with this review).Focus (-): You can set auto-focus in different ways: have the camera choose the focus point for you (almost always fails), or you set the focus point & compose accordingly (almost always succeeds, especially when you make the focus point as small as possible).. The X100 also has manual focus, but I hate (really hate) electric focus.Viewfinder (+): You can hold your camera in front of you & use the large LCD to compose & capture the image (EVF), or peep into the eye viewfinder for the old fashioned optical viewfinder (OVF) which you can also switch to the electronic viewfinder & see the same information as the LCD display (EVF).. The beauty of the (EVF) is it allows you to see the depth of field, EV compensation, and any film effect you're applying (B&W;, B&W;+filters, Velvia, Provia, Astia, or Sepia).Film Simulation (+): The simulations are B&W;, B&W;+filters, Velvia, Provia, Astia, or Sepia.. FUJIFILM really did a good job in these simulations, I'm 99% on B&W; (monochrome) and switch to Velvia every now and then. Film Simulation is only applied on JPEG, that's why I'm shooting RAW+JPEG. But the simulation is so good, I didn't need to use the RAW files for B&W; conversion.Motion Panorama (+): I'm used to creating panorama by taking several shots & stitching them later in post processing on a computer. The X100 allows you to make a motion panorama, just pan the camera (120\u00ba or 180\u00ba) and it takes the needed frames & stitch them for you. The result is a JPEG panorama in the Film Simulation of your choice.Battery life (-): The camera ships with a battery that lasts around 300 shots, which isn't enough.. All I can say is, order an additional battery when ordering the camera. I ordered 2 OEM batteries, they cost roughly 20% of the original battery.Enjoy the camera & happy photography :)", "Date": "November 25, 2011"}, {"Title": "excellent. frustrating.", "Author": "S. Flask", "ReviewID": "R39DOGI7963SR3", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "the X100 has been out for a while now, so i suspect i won't be adding much here that isn't already known.  i will therefore try to keep this succinct.the x100 is a wonderful camera for street shooting.  the 35mm focal length is just wide enough to get what you want in the shot.  in fact, it wasn't until i was restricted to 35mm with the X100 that i realized just how much i like this focal length; it really works for me.  that said, one has to be willing to photograph at 35mm all the time with this camera, and there are certainly people out there who won't like that.  if you're someone who spends most of your time shooting at focal lengths of 50mm and up, this may not work for you.build quality is excellent, and i have no complaints about any of the manual controls.  the aperture ring is fantastic - i wish my DSLR had one.  the dual OVF/EVF is also excellent.  i tend to use the EVF in low light situations as it's brighter than the OVF, as well as in close up situations in order to eliminate parallax.  i use the OVF the rest (majority) of the time.  the information overlay is excellent, and i really like that the frame shifts when you focus to successfully adjust for parallax for subjects that are more than a few feet away.image quality?  honestly, image quality wasn't the reason i initially purchased the X100, but now that i own it i'd recommend buying this camera for image quality alone.  it is, to put it bluntly, amazing.  fuji's colors, combined with the sensor's dynamic range, yield truly beautiful results (usually without a lot of post processing).  you could shoot JPG on this camera and not sweat it - something i can't say for my more expensive DSLR setup.  noise isn't a problem until you get up around ISO 3200 and above, and honestly i shoot at ISO 3200 regularly with this camera with no problem.  it's even forgiving at ISO 3200 *without* exposing \"to the right\".  image quality makes this camera.faults?  you betcha!  there's really only one major fault, as far as i'm concerned, and that's the focusing system.  AF is good enough for street style shooting in most conditions, but it turns to garbage in low light.  really, it's terrible.  i could let this slide if manual focusing worked, but it doesn't.  example:  you want to manual focus the lens at 1 foot, and it's currently focused at 30 feet - you can sit there spinning the ring for what seems like a good 30 seconds before you've reached you goal.  this is fuji's \"fly by wire\" manual focusing, and it's awful.  you'd think this is something that could be fixed with a firmware update, but none exists to date.  if they fixed the MF in firmware i'd be fine with the lousy AF.  until then, lower light focusing is annoying to say the least.other faults mostly include silly firmware bugs that really should just be fixed.  you can't program the (useless) RAW button to any other function, but you can program the Fn button to many different things.  so i have to choose between, for instance, easy access to ISO or the ND filter or the auto ISO setting.  (the auto ISO setting is great, by the way.  it lets you determine the lowest allowable shutter speed before the camera bumps the ISO, and it lets you set the ceiling on the highest ISO you want to allow.)  also, for the life of me i can't figure out why certain things work the way they do.  for instance, i'll have the camera to my eye and press the menu button, and i'll see the menu in the viewfinder.  but then i'll try to do this another time and it won't work - it'll pop up on the LCD!  these quirks are annoying.  i can live with them, but they really do seem like they'd be easy to fix via firmware update.aside from the aforementioned issues, the X100 is very enjoyable to use.  the size is just right, it feels good in your hands and you can change your aperture and shutter speed very easily without having to get all caught up in the camera.  the leaf shutter is almost completely silent, which is great for street shooting.  i take shots with this camera that i normally wouldn't be comfortable taking with my much larger, louder DSLR.  and as i mentioned, image quality is fantastic.  if this sounds like it's up your alley, and you can life with the quirks, don't hesitate to check out the X100.a quick afterthought on accessories:  JJC makes an aftermarket lens hood/adapter ring combo that retails for much less than the fuji brand.  the JJC is of excellent quality and fits just right, so don't be afraid to order it.  the adapter ring will allow you to attach a 49mm filter.edit 2/13/12:  the more i use this camera, the more i love it.  my complaints about the focusing system still stand, but the image quality far outweighs the issues.  the way tones transition from light to dark, the way the camera manages highlights with its expanded dynamic range, and the colors... all are just great.  i find i don't have to worry about tweaking the exposure to avoid blown highlights nearly as much as i have to on my canon 7D.  i realize this is kind of a subjective area, and not all may feel the same way, but personally this camera creates images that *look* the way i want them to.  i didn't realize what i was missing out on.edit 3/29/12:  recently Fuji released firmware version 1.2 for the X100.  it's worth mentioning that the AF performance has increased dramatically, especially in low light.  in really low light environments such as a bar the X100 previously could almost never lock focus.  now it focuses almost every time.  this is a huge improvement and is worth noting.  manual focusing is better in regular light - usable at least, but not great.  it's still lousy in low light.  but the improvement to the AF performance is night and day.edit 5/18/12:  i don't really have much to report, other than i really do like this camera!  i recently went on a three day vacation where i had to travel light, so i decided to ditch my DSLR and bag of lenses and just bring the X100.  i tweaked the b&w; setting to my liking and shot the whole three days on one SD card.  (by the way - i got a new, faster 45mb/sec CF card and it makes a BIG difference in file write times, especially raw.)  the camera performed very well, and for the type of shooting i was doing i never missed my DSLR.  great little camera.edit 1/28/13:  it's not often i feel compelled to return to a review nearly a year later.  i just wanted to say that i'm still loving the x100 - possibly even more as time passes.  i'd kill to have the manual focus cleaned up on this thing, but other than that it's great.  i slow down a bit and take fewer photos when using my x100.  i enjoy that.  if fuji keeps heading in the right direction they could completely convert me from my SLR.  we'll see!edit 11/25/13:  why update a review for a camera that's been replaced with a new model?  because Fuji is still releasing firmware updates!  Manual focus is greatly improved with the latest firmware, and the autofocus has come so far since i first got this camera it's almost hard to believe.  AF is still a little slow compared to the market leaders at this time, but it's very manageable.  if you can't (or don't want to) afford the latest X100s i'd grab a used copy of the X100 in a second.", "Date": "January 30, 2012"}, {"Title": "Trials and Tribulations", "Author": "J. Miller", "ReviewID": "R2QZULUT1UKL8P", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I own the Fuji X-Pro1 and decided to buy the Black Edition x100 as more of a carry anywhere camera. Just arrived today-Saturday-with an extra battery from Fuji and the camera is dead. It will not start up with either battery after charging both or with or without a card. This is utterly unacceptable. Turns out this is more common than I ever imagined as there are many posts of either dead X100's or ones where start-up is inconsistent. Sent Fuji an email but may just box it up and send it back. I love my X-Pro1 and have never had any of these kinds of issues with it. For this weekend it's an expensive paperweight until I can either talk to someone on Monday or just send it back for a refund.***As a follow-up, I've spoken with Fuji and Amazon and have decided to return it. In the past 48 hours since I purchased it the price has dropped $300. Bottom line is while it feels like a hefty well-made product, I've decided after reading too many comments on quality issues to not have it replaced. Maybe the X200 will come in as a better product. My X-Pro1 still works awesome. It's just too bad this X100 doesn't work.******10/11: As a final follow-up, I decided to give the X100 another try with another Black Edition. This time, after much crossing of fingers and candles burning with chants to the Fuji gods, the battery went in and the X100 actually turned on. Something the previous one never did. So far it keeps turning on and the output is truly lovely. While it doesn't have the Xtrans sensor of my X-Pro1, I don't know if I would be able to tell unless I really started pixel peeping. I bought the X-Pro1 for the simple reason that my D700 and lenses were not great traveling companions due to their size and weight and needed something smaller and more inconspicuous. As small as the X-Pro1 is compared to the D700, it still isn't a pocket camera. The X100 feels like an X-Pro1 left on high in the dryer for too long. It will fit-barely-into my jeans pocket and looks diminutive sitting next too my X-Pro1 with the 35/1.4. The quality and weight actually feels better than my X-Pro1. The first time I picked up the X-Pro1 I thought it would feel heavier while I had the opposite view and reaction to the X100. It is small, solid and feels substantial in the hand. The silent mode was a pleasant surprise as it is literally silent. If I didn't see the picture come up I wouldn't know it had taken one. That's how utterly silent it is.Here are some of my personal conclusions around the mirrorless enthusiast camera segment after owning a few:1: The rangefinder style works great on smaller sized cameras. Your nose is out of the way as you look through the viewfinder and it is very easy and quick to go from observing to shooting something you just came upon.2: I'm not a fan of the style that does not have a viewfinder at all. I owned an X1 for a couple months and sold it for many reasons. A big one-after the WB issues and slow performance-was using the lcd screen only left me feeling disconnected with what I was trying to capture. The viewfinder for me is the tunnel where everything else falls away and I can concentrate on the moment and outcome.3: The only time I miss my D700 or 1DS Mark II-both of which have gone onto ebay heaven-is low light combined with movement such as kids moving around the Christmas tree, etc. Other than that, my back, wrist and briefcase are all much happier. There are trade-offs with the Fuji(s) but so far the trades are good ones.4: While I have been in software for 20 years and love hearing people talk about iPhone versus Android around features and interface, the original interface starts with your hands and fingers. How something feels to grab and hold relates directly to if you want to pick it up or put it down. Fuji has figured out how to build beautiful quality products that I want to hold and ultimately use. The OM-D has a similar feel. Light, thin, slippery-smooth with cheap plastics just don't encourage usage for me. Heft and quality make the difference and you'll find both Fuji's always charged and ready to go on my desk and one always with me in person. I want to use them.There are so many great new cameras coming out in this segment and it will be fun to see what comes next around the RX1, X200, etc.Doubt you could go wrong nearly anywhere.Just find your style of shooting and what makes you want to pick one up and use it.", "Date": "October 6, 2012"}, {"Title": "Who says this isn't a \"beginner's\" camera?", "Author": "Rob Marciello", "ReviewID": "RHNM5X7OO9TPC", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "OK, so maybe that's true.

I was pleasantly surprised when I tried it out. It locked immediately with no issues at all. It was way faster than I thought it'd be. The firmware is 1.30. I think Fuji really improved the autofocus with firmware updates. For a point of comparison my other camera is an Olympus EP3. The EP3 with  the Panasonic 20mm lens is comparable in autofocus speed. The Panny 20mm is known as a slower focusing lens in the micro four thirds system. I walk around all day with the 20 on my EP3 and never miss a shot. The x100 feels just the same.I tried the autofocus in very very dim light. I went outside at 11pm and tried locking the autofocus on different things at different distances. To my surprise it locked just fine. No hunting at all. It was so dark that all I could see in the viewfinder was black.The only autofocus issue still left is macro. It does hunt in macro mode. The fix is to put the camera in manual focus mode and lock the focus using the AEL button on the back of the camera. For some reason this is way faster than putting the camera in macro mode. It works very well. I do find that even with this method the x100 will hunt a bit in close up from time to time. Not too bad though.High ISO is stellar. ISO 3200 is way better than ISO 1250 on my EP3. Haven't tried 6400 yet but I'd have no problem using 3200 without giving it a second thought.Lastly the hybrid viewfinder is awesome.

If you don't shoot fast moving objects/people, I highly recommend.If you don't require an interchangeable lens, think about this one seriously.Reviews have mentioned that the menu system is non-intuitive ... what camera system is? (Nikon, Canon or otherwise)  It's all what you're used to and familiar with. I spent a day reading and playing around with the functions and it wasn't a long before I felt comfortable with it in finding things.Realistically, this camera isn't really for a novice to get the full benefit from it's features and intended use. A lot of the controls are manual in nature and placement of some of the dials to control exposure and aperture aren't the easiest to adjust while framing a shot. This is one of those cameras where you will be more successful when you have a little bit of time to think about your composition and exposure settings before making an image as this isn't the speediest camera to take faster moving things. That said, I've also had great success so far in presetting my focal range at a particular aperture setting (in manual focus).This camera is super quiet and virtually goes unnoticed when shooting in the street. The OVF and EVF are unique, it takes some time to choose which one works best for you. Battery life is not bad, be sure to buy extra battery though (I have 3). By the time you get the red colored low battery indication, you're probably 5 shots from it going completely dead.Image and LCD quality are fantastic, hands down. Jpg is very good, but RAW is even better. ISO range is great - even at 3200, but for my liking, I max it out at 1600. I leave this in auto-ISO for most applications with great results.

The image quality this camera produces comes close to that of my 5dmkII and 35L in which this combo is nearly triple the price - not to mention triple the size.

Tierney", "ReviewID": "R2MAVMFSHMPTR7", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Quick background: I'm an amateur photographer who normally shoots with a Nikon D5100 and a 35mm prime.  I also use a Sony NEX3, and was using a Samsung NX200 quite often before selling it to pick up this used Fujifilm X100.  I like to shoot friends and family at outings, and I also shoot at a variety of events for the nonprofit I work for.  I don't do much landscape/nature stuff.I've been using the X100 for a few weeks, and I can tell you without hesitation that even at 2 years old, this camera still holds its own against anything else I've used.  It's a joy to shoot with.  The newest updates (can't believe after two years Fuji is still updating firmware) take care of nearly all previous issues that original reviewers had.  Autofocus is plenty fast, and minimum focusing distance is perfectly fine - I rarely shoot macro but I guess there used to be an issue where close-up portraits sometimes required a switch to macro mode.I'll be honest, one reason I bought this camera is because of how unique it looks.  I love the full-manual controls where you can dial in your settings.  People ask about it all the time, so if you enjoy talking photography it's a great conversation-starter when you're out shooting.  The good news is, it also happens to capture outstanding images.Some comments mentioned that this is not a beginner camera.  I would disagree.  If you're a beginner and you desire to know more about how a camera functions and become a better photographer, this is the perfect camera for you!  The dials beg to be used, and in my opinion there's a better chance that you'll manually mess around with your shutter speed and aperture on this camera than you would on a DSLR.It's very simple to put everything on auto, hand it to a friend and let them snap a few shots as well - the auto white balance nails it more often than not, you can set a minimum shutter speed and auto ISO, everyone's happy.  Low light performance knocks the socks off of the Samsung NX200 I was using.I paid $550 for a used X100.  I wouldn't pay much more, especially with the X100S now out.

I am beyond in love with this camera. 12.3 MP is absolutely outstanding for such a small camera. I photograph with a Nikon D7000 and occasionally a D90 usually, but this camera does just as good. This camera is completely perfect for street photography & close ups, and when I don't want to lug my big D7000, this one fits perfectly into my purse. A lot of reviews say that this isn't a beginner's camera, and I agree to a certain point. If you're looking for a point-and-shoot there are much better cameras for you to choose from. But if you're used to a D7000 or other DSLR then this camera will suit you wonderfully.PROS:1. You will get SO many compliments & inquiries due to it's classic look2.

But like all technology, it's equally important to know for whom it is not as well as who is going to like it. I have seen other reviews, some of which label the X100 as \"idiosyncratic.\" This is true insofar as using a Kodak Retina IIIc with its sports finder and selenium light meter, or changing film on a 1960s Nikon F by removing the whole back, or remembering to set the ISO in Leicas before the M7 were idiosyncratic.This is a camera for people who miss film (sort of), who want to see what happens with different aperture / shutter combinations, or (gasp) focus manually and hope they get it right. The lack of a zoom is an asset - it forces you to see at a fixed focal length, and keeps the camera to a manageable size. You can actually stick this camera in a coat pocket, and take it with you everywhere. The shutter is silent. It allows you to take spontaneous, unposed pictures that you can only take with cameras that are discrete enough because they don't look like shotguns. The fixed focal length forces you to see what you want before you take the picture. If you need more magnification, get closer, or vice versa.I have used this camera at weddings and family reunions with the EFS-42 flash, bounced from whatever was handy. The results are uniformly excellent. But you have to pay attention to the camera settings, just like you did with film. Works well with light-triggered slaves and studio flash.I have taken this camera on walks in places all over the world. Its discrete size and silence made all the difference. I took pictures where whipping out your DSLR with your masculine zoom lens would have made it impossible to do so. It is a photographer's camera. I think if Henri Cartier-Bresson were alive today, the anonymity an X100 lends would have led him to consider using one, especially if Fuji offered a version painted matte black (hint, hint).I'm aware, and suffered through, the learning curve for using this camera. That is true of any piece of equipment. Sometimes I think complaints about navigating menus and so forth are excuses for not becoming familiar with the equipment you buy. This is a camera worth buying, and getting to know. It is not a camera for casual shooters. It will be a waste to leave the shutter and exposure dials on \"A\" permanently.", "Date": "December 29, 2011"}, {"Title": "Fujifilm X100 first impressions", "Author": "Robert.C", "ReviewID": "R38BMBO5VX1CQG", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "The camera arrived two days ago, and while I haven't taken it out for a shoot yet, I've been playing with it and testing it indoors.As soon as you pick it up, you're rewarded with the feel of a beautifully designed device, with great craftsmanship, finish and weight. Just like my iPhone 4. The optical viewfinder is crystal clear, taking you back to the film days, with the HUGE added bonus of digitally overlaying useful information, such as exposure configuration, histogram, etc. I was surprised by how quiet the shutter is! The camera came loaded with the latest firmware (1.11 as of this writing), so I've proceeded with formatting my memory card (which is recommended for best performance), and started going through the setup.Without reading the manual, I've cycled through all the menu options, and seemed pretty straight forward. Within an hour or two I had a pretty good understanding of the configuration options, and had the camera configured to my liking. I was pleasantly surprised that the menu is nowhere near as bad as most reviewers on the Internet make it out to be. Once you use it a few times, you're familiar enough to be able to quickly get to a setting if needed.Regarding the manual focus so many complain about: yes, it is unusable as a conventional manual focus ring as it's very slow. However, as many pointed out, you can hit the AFL/AEL button on the back in manual focus mode, and the camera will auto focus for you. Where the manual focus ring with it's slow response comes in handy is TWEAKING your focus. Once you've focused with the AFL/AEL button, you can click the middle of the Command dial (above the AFL/AEL button), which in Electronic Viewfinder Mode will give you a 100% magnification of you focus point. You can then fine tune focus with the manual ring. This can be useful at close focusing distances, or difficult lighting situations.Auto focus speed is more than adequate. The image quality tests indoors seem very good. I will be testing it outdoors in the coming days & weeks.I have only touched on the few main points criticized the most on the Internet based on my research. I was happy to learn that they are all negligible (and I've been researching this camera for the past two weeks pretty much on a daily basis). There are tons of other detailed reviews out there that give you a full report. I agree with them on the positives: great image quality, great build, excellent viewfinder, amazingly quiet shutter, great manual control dials, a large DSLR sized sensor, packed in a durable but conveniently sized package. Yes, it's on the pricey side, but quality always is.If you're like me, a bit apprehensive about some of the reviews, don't be. This camera is a joy to use with very good image quality. I am not a professional, just a hobbyist. I do own a Canon 30d & a Canon 5d, along with a Canon S95 point and shoot, which I'll now be selling :).Hope this helps.", "Date": "December 3, 2011"}, {"Title": "Fantastic Image Quality", "Author": "M.

Some of the  reviews have mentioned that the performance of the camera is slow, but I don't really find that to be the case at all.  It's very quick scrolling through and selecting menu items (the menu's could be better organized).  Like all contrast detection focusing system there are some instances in lower light where it hunts for the proper focus, but it's no worse than any other contrast detection focusing camera that I've experienced.  It can take about 4 seconds to save a raw file, but jpeg images are so good you'll rarely want to shoot in raw format.  The hybrid view finder is fantastic with information overlayed on the optical viewfinder when in optical mode, while switching to electronic viewfinder mode allows you to preview depth of field and see the effects of film modes, WB, etc.  The Image quality is where the X100 really shines.  The images in both JPEG and RAW format are incredible and the low light performance is beyond belief.  Images exhibit very little noise through ISO 3200 are and more than usable at ISO 6400 and even ISO 12800.  The auto white balance works very well and the camera renders very accurate colors.  The film simulation modes do a very good job at simulating fuji provia, astia, and velvia films as far as their color rendition.  The cost is also mentioned as a detriment in many reviews, and ,while the camera is expensive, I think it's worth the cost given it's image quality and low light performance.  Other Interchangeable lens cameras such as the Panasonic GF2 and Olympus E-PL2 start to approach the price of the X100 when you add in things like a fast pancake lens and electronic viewfinder.  For example the E-PL2, which I think is probably the closest competitor in terms of image quality outside of a full DSLR, with a 17mm 2.8 lens and electronic viewfinder will run you about $1050.  A pansonic GF2 will be cheaper at about $850 with 14mm 2.5 lens and electronic viewfinder, but the image quality and low light performance is no where near that of the fuji x100.  Yes you'll get the flexibility of being able to change lenses with these other cameras, but they don't measure up to the X100 in image quality.  The X100 is not for everyone; it's certainly not for beginners.  it's probably more likely going to be a second camera in the arsenal of an advanced amateur or pro that already owns a DSLR system.

Otherwise, the focusing accuracy is far better than my 5D mark 2, and sadly enough, faster in dim lighting conditions.Handing your camera off to someone else? Set the dials to \"A\" and let them go for it. this thing makes brilliant decisions, it nails exposure, and its decision making regarding color is second to none.Oh yeah and the on camera flash is actually useable, and at certain distances gives a glamorous ring light effect.In summary, as a full time commercial shooter, and an owner of top of the line Canon products, this is my favorite camera EVER.

I kind of got lucky when I was traveling I happened to find it in a local camera shop.  In any case, when I first opened up the box, the camera and everything about it to the packaging just screamed of quality.  This camera is really well built and is definitely an attention grabber.  Everybody who sees it immediately gravitates towards the camera and starts asking questions about it since most people have never heard of it.  Most, though, are very surprised to find out how much it costs!  As far as picture quality goes, I don't think you can really do much better than this in the size of this camera.  I have owned many mid to high end compact cameras before this....  Canon, Sony, Nikon, Ricoh, etc... NONE of them came close to the picture quality you can get out of this camera.  With it's fixed f2 lens and APS-C sensor the pictures and bokeh you can get with this camera are incredible.  I've had many people comment on my pictures I've taken at weddings/etc about how good they turned out!Pros:- Style... this camera is great in this department... Fujiflim really knocked it out with this- f2 lens, APS-C sensor... cannot beat this combo, especially since the lens and sensor are mated for one another (lens not removable)- EVF is great, especially with the eye sensorCons:- focusing is a little slow, especially in low lightConclusion:Overall, I'm very happy with this camera and can see myself keeping it for a long time to come given that I don't think that it's vintage/retro look will go out of style.  Since I got this, several new cameras have burst out on to the scene including the Sony NEX7 and Olympus OM-D as well as others.  While those cameras intrigue me, I think I'll stick with the X100... The newer mirrorless cameras seem great and all but removable lenses on such a small package kind of defeat the purpose of having a compact camera.

I find the build quality and ergonomics of the camera outstanding. It has the right weight and size, it is a pleasure to shoot with it. The camera has some notable quirks that others have already documented.  For example, in bright light, the shutter seems to do a dance (open-close-open-close-open) before it lets you take a picture.  Nonetheless, the feel of the magnesium-alloy body, lens cap, the grip, etc. are great.  The controls on the top are a pleasure to use as a photographer.  As you can see, it is easy to use your thumb to adjust the +- exposure compensation dial on the top right of the camera.  Overall, I recommend it.", "Date": "September 30, 2012"}, {"Title": "Quick Review", "Author": "etane", "ReviewID": "RX82EVZR5EKJD", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Just opened up the box like 30 minutes ago.  First impression, very easy to use.  Makes me happy when I hold it in my hands.  It's slightly smaller and lighter than the Nikon FE.  Design wise, it's sweet.I am pretty happy with low light pics up to 2500 iso at F2.Tried to manual focus, but, when using the focus ring, nothing happens at first.  Switched on the EVF, then you can see the manual focusing working.  Forgot it's not a SLR, so you have to use EVF when manual focusing.  Also, manual focusing is a pain on the X100.  You turn and turn the dial, and the focus field changes either very slowly or very abruptly.  The manual focusing is not mechanical like on a SLR lens body but is electronic.  I wouldn't the camera in manual focus mode unless I have to.Shutter speed is on a dial and is self pretty explanatory.  I think my Nikon D90 has more speeds though.  Aperture dial is on the lens.  It's easy to turn as long as you are using the knurled protruding portion.  ISO is pre-programmed on the function button.  Just press the function button and use the arrow button to go up or down on the menu screen or in the EVF.One dislike is the positioning of the battery and SD card door.  It's right next to the hole where you screw in the tripod head release plate.  So, each time I need to access that door, I need to remove the release plate.Another dislike is I tried to plug in a mini USB to try to access the card without accessing the battery door.  I couldn't plug the minu USB cord in.  The input connection is slightly smaller.  Stupid USB port is proprietary.  Maybe there is an ultra mini USB connection standard that I don't know about?I have the Fuji MX700.  It's an ancient model from like 1996 if I remember correctly.  I haven't used it in quite awhile, but I remember the menu and general GUI to be very similar to the Fuji X100.My camera came with the latest 1.11 firmware installed.12/29/2011 Update:I've purchased a few accessories for the X100.  First, I received Gariz half case.  Second, I received a 49mm B+W circular polarizer filter as well as Rainbow Imaging's filter adapter and hood.  The Gariz case has a bottom plate that works as an adapter.  It screws into the X100's bottom and has another tripod screw-in about 1\" away from the battery door.  So, now I can access the battery door without removing the quick release plate.  And, I find the X100's color to be a bit flat.  The circular polarizer solves this problem.  Images with the filter on are a tad cooler but colors are much more lively and details are a bit more distinct.Been using the X100 with Manfrotto 484 tripod head w/ release plate, 680B monopod and 678 monopod folding base.  The monopod with folding base is great for long exposure shots especially with the X100 since it is not nearly as heavy as a DSLR.  Portability is awesome compared to DSLR plus full tripod.", "Date": "December 15, 2011"}, {"Title": "Awesome Little Camera", "Author": "James Leng \"J\"", "ReviewID": "R2TQUR00XJI95N", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Loving my fuji x100, having bought it after 4 years of using a Nikon D300 on extensive traveling trips.The 23mm focal length is perfect for streetscapes and landscapes, and when combined with f2.0, makes it quite nice for portraits as well (get close!) and I have no qualms about using it with iso6400 for great clear shots in low light situations.  The main weakness for me is the autofocusing speed, and sometimes in low light it just refuses to acquire the subject.  The manual focus is kind of useless because it requires so many rotations on the focusing ring to get it right.  Having to switch to macro mode is kind of silly as well.

The reviews for the X100 (with firmware updates) were a truly bizarre mix of love/hate and all seemed to have a \"great camera BUT...\" But the images posted just knocked my socks off.  I own a Pentax K-5 and S mode is my preferred shooting mode.  I was afraid that the X100 would be too finicky a customer.  After 2 weeks with the camera, reading every review and tips on the Web, I have to tell you that this is a wonderful camera with astounding amounts of controls...but you must update the firmware when you get it unless you purchase the black version.  Secondly, I found I could use it in an S mode by simply setting the lens to A (auto aperture) and the shutter dial to A as well.  You can then use the Fn button and the \"command wheel\" to set your iSO and have the camera in ISO-driven mode.  That, plus the \"EV-bracketing\" drive setting automatically gives you 3 shots bracketing the auto EVF setting by the interval you choose.  Amazing! The lens is superb...

I usually use a nikon D300s DSLR and i was looking to drop some pounds from the  camera body i use without losing the image quality. First things first, this camera DOES NOT replace a DSLR and shouldn't be compared to it. If you shoot sport, running kids or pets this camera is not for you and you don't need to read any further. If you're looking to have a superb image quality for your portraits, street photos, travel photography,  landscapes, and low light photography; than this may be what you've been looking for.Pros:discreet,super light,solid built,A very silent shutter sound,great optics (the f/2 Fujinon is superb),elegant,not cheap but affordable, excellent image quality (same sensor size as the CMOS sensor on non-full frame SLR!!!!)A pleasure to work with (the shutter speed button , the aperture slider, ....)A SUPERB Electrical View Finder (EVF)that is the FIRST OF ITS KIND IN THE WORLD, you can alternate between the EVF and an elegant Optical one (OVF) in one touch. While using the EVF you shoot EXACTLY what you see via the view finder, a luxury that even any multithousand dollars LEICA doesn't have. A BIG PLUSCons:Battery life is horrible (you need to get at least one extra genuine Fuji battery and please don't waste your money of the cheap alternatives),The manual ring focus is not practical (hopefully to be fixed in upcoming firmware updates)The Continuous AF is crappy (not best choice for very fast continuously moving  subjects)The Macro mode focus is a hit and miss yet overall acceptable since the hits are often what I get, and once you get the focus what a reward.Not the most intuitive software (though the updated firm did a lot and hopefully more to come)NO interchangeable lenses (for me personally it's not a negative thing, i don't care to carry lenses in my travels and the 35 mm equivalent is almost of a universal use, add to it the superb performance even at very low light thanks to the f/2 of the Fujinon)NO ZOOM option, again not an issue for me personally.So the last two points aren't even an issue for me and in fact it's an exercise for me to improve my photography.So overall, an EXCELLENT camera, but it's not for you if you're looking for just a point and shoot cam, or a zoom camera that does the work for you.This is for you if -like me- you want to leave your heavy bag of lenses and SLR when you need (long walks, travel...) and you still want to get a superb PRO image quality, superb bokeh, and the fun of making photos.", "Date": "July 17, 2011"}, {"Title": "brings me back to the magic of photography", "Author": "Minyan Zhu \"Jinx\"", "ReviewID": "R161Q1HN750LQS", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I've been a professional photographer for the past 4 years and have shot with various Nikon Cameras (D700) and Fujifilm Cameras (S5)When I first heard about the X100 last year, I was really stoked about getting it into my grubby little hands. Now that it's here, it's definitely been a beautiful and frustrating experience.I love how small and \"tight\" the camera feels, and that little bump on the grip helps me to clutch it with ease. The optical viewfinder is a treat to use and I rarely ever switch to the electronic viewfinder. The only time that I'll switch on the E.V.F is when I'm shooting video and need to stabilize it against my head for still videos, in those instances, the E.V.F is brilliant and a welcome addition to the camera.The shutter is blissfully silent! So silent that I can photograph people on the bus and on the streets with out them noticing, this to me is an invaluable tool that opens up a whole new world of photographic sneakiness.The JPG files are pretty dense and can be bent and processed with very good results. however when shooting in Raw, I'm able to have about 3-4 stops of additional information to work with. Beautiful!!Manual focus is absolutely useless!  Don't rely on it to do anything that you would need fast reflexes for. It's a drive by wire type of manual focus, so it's a very digital feeling thing. I totally understand the compromise on Fuji's part on this decision, if they had wanted a well dampened and silky smooth manual focus experience, the auto focus experience would have greatly suffered, or may have never existed at all. you can get around this issue though by researching and learning how to use hyperfocal distances.The whole camera experience is generally sluggish compared to the Nikon D700, menu operations........ slow, focus acquision...... semi slow, but acceptable, start up time....... slow, write times........... slow. But then again most cameras feel sluggish to the Nikon D700's speed. I'd say that the X100 overall speed experience is similar to that of the fujifilm s5.The Lens at f/2.0 is quite soft, like dog poo soft, but sharpens up nicely from f/2.8 and is critically sharp from f/4.0 - f/8.0The magic that I speak of is in the user experience, and that is the apeture being at the base of the lens and the exposure being right where old school cameras had them. I remember the frustrations and the tribulations of learning on my old manual focus minolta, and this camera brings me right back to that magical state of curiosity and possibility.the best thing of all is that I want to actually have this camera with me at all times, not true with my nikon or fujifilm s5 slrs.

My rating would be 4 1/2 stars if Amazon allowed it.Image quality is out of this world.  My main camera is a Canon 5D Mark III and this little Fuji gives it a run for its money.  I'd even go so far to say that the Fuji slaps the Canon down hard when it comes to nailing the color with auto white balance.  Sure, white balance is simple to fix when shooting in RAW, but it's an extra step and the Fuji gets it right more often than not.However, by far the best thing about this camera is that Fuji has continued to support it.  Upon releasing the x100s, it would have been easy to \"pull and Apple\" and just sort of forget this thing existed, encouraging customers to upgrade.  But no. Fuji developed a firmware upgrade that address not only addressed frustrations (such as the sloppy manual focus ring), but added completely new functionality to the camera (focus peaking).I'd go so far as to say that with the latest firmware, there is very little incentive to choose the x100 over the x100s for *most* people. That's a pretty bold move for Fuji, but it shows their commitment to their customers.The x100 is an incredibly fun camera to use, but it should be understood that it isn't the most versatile thing on the planet.  It's a fixed focal length lens, which I love, but others might be put off by it.  This thing may be the size of the point and shoot, but it's more related to a Micro 4/3 or DSLR in terms of user involvement in the photo taking process.For all of the praise, I'm not blind to the camera's quirks. The menu system isn't the most intuitive, and the button / dial layout will take a little getting used to. This is definitely not a camera to be in an excessive hurry with. But these quirks really don't take away from the overall enjoyment of using the camera.So... About that \"one flaw\" I mentioned in the title of this review.  I think it's kind of a big deal, and so far as I know, it's a flaw that DOES carry over to the x100s...In my experience, it is far, far, far too easy to accidentally bump the power switch when traveling with the camera.Here's the thing: 99% of the time when you're USING the camera, you'll want to turn it on and forget about it.  When you aren't using it, it will go to \"sleep\" to protect your battery and will wake up with any press of a button.  No big deal.But if you toss the camera into a bag (or even a pocket -- yes, it will fit in a jacket pocket), what you DO NOT want is the power switch accidentally turning to the \"on\" position, and then random button presses draining your battery so that the camera is dead when you want / need to use it.I do get that the placement of the power switch was intended to be an ergonomic advantage.  However, like I said, when you are actually using the camera, there's no real need to keep turning it on and off.  You only need it off for long term storage or transport, and in that case, you want it to STAY off until you need it.So given that, I'd much rather have seen the power switch moved to a different, less prone to being bumped, location.  Maybe even a lock button that needs to be pressed to slide the switch.But that's the only complaint against an otherwise fantastic camera.", "Date": "March 12, 2014"}, {"Title": "x100 is a winner", "Author": "Bobbie Lee", "ReviewID": "R22VZCSJGI060R", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "purchased the x100 used from Amazon.  great product.  firmware update was easily accomplished.  the image quality from the camera is really good.

Having an electronic as well as an optical viewfinder is really a treat (along with the ability to aim and shoot relying on the LCD).as compared to a DSLR, the advantage of the x100 is small form factor.  the disadvantage is that the x100 takes more time to lock focus, even with firmware 2.01.  when shooting speed is of the essence, I would rather have my full frame Canon 5D instead.  Otherwise, this is a great camera.  don't know how much better the x100s is, but for the much reduced price i purchased the x100 used for , i would say keep your money and go with the x100, or alternatively, pick up a used x100 as well as a used Canon 5d (original - not MK II, not MK III), along with a nifty fifty (50mm F/1.8 MK I or MK II) and you'll spend just a little more than a new x100s.  that way you've have both a high end point and shoot as well as pretty darn good full frame DSLR.  happy shooting!", "Date": "January 29, 2014"}, {"Title": "5 stars means I love it", "Author": "M.

Initial thoughts:Not going to replace s DSLR, at least not for me. This does not have the versatility, speed or ease of use in manual and semi-automatic modes. Having said that the image quality from carefully composed shots is comparable to my D7000.While not quite compact it is much less to carry than a DSLR. It won't fit in a pants pocket but will fit in a jacket pocket. Ladies can put it in a purse. For guys a strap, belt pouch or back pack (with LOTS of extra room left) would be in order if it is too hot for a jacket. I use a wrist strap and carrying it around for about half a day in my hand was no problem, except of course when I needed to use that hand for something else. I mainly got this for those times where I said to myself \"I wish I had my camera\" but wouldn't be carrying a DSLR.Even at firmware 2.01 the AF is painfully slow and made me miss shots waiting for lock. I have read that there are some tricks around this involving using the manual focus mode, but at least out of the box it is not reliable for fleeting shots. Snap shots pretty much turn out awful, beyond what would be expected from lack of compositional thought.Closer than about 4 feet you have to engage Macro mode. This is frustrating and once again results in lost shots if you are not prepared.Low light capability is APS-C, DSLR quality. You will not get full frame performance obviously, but for a camera this size I was surprised how well it handled subway tunnels. I have not tried night shooting it yet. Indoors is very good.The photography experience is truly modern retro rather than a modern camera with retro clothes. It is a bit hard to explain, but the Aperture and shutter speed controls are retro in a functional and also attractive way, while the modern components do not feel like they were shoe horned into an older film body (e.g. the Nikon Df.) I did not find it jarring to use retro manual controls in combination with modern control features. Everything does feel like it was designed with the over all experience in mind.The optical viewfinder is ingenious. The EVF is ok but has the problems you would expect. EVF image review in the finder is nice, but not really that accurate as to detail. It does let you know you got the shot though. I turn the LCD except to image review so I can't comment on live view modes.Battery life is horrible. If you buy this camera you will need to buy spares and carry them if you are doing anything more than a couple of hours photo walk.You are zooming with your feet. If you shoot only  35mm or 50mm prime lenses this probably won't bother you. If you uses zooms for anything this is not your camera or at least not your main camera.The subjective factor. Despite some frustrating issues and lack of responsiveness that I am used to, I do like this camera and think 4 stars is about right. There really is a form factor that I really enjoy and it is a very pretty machine (if you like cameras). Honestly even at a nearly 1/2 it's price new it is a little hard for me to justify objectively as for me it will be a secondary/niche camera. Having said that I don't plan to return it. For carefully composed shots it is a wonderful camera. Most reviews state this is not a beginners camera and I will repeat that. It definitely demands that you give full attention to composition, and think about your shot before the camera comes up to your eye, which is by no means a bad thing. I would not label it a DSLR killer and I think those who do either have a specific style of shooting that plays to this cameras strengths or are getting caught up in the subjective experience. On the other hand if you are in the market for a compact camera that can produce professional results (IF you put in the effort) this is a good buy. Be aware that it is a demanding camera to use.Update: After using this for a couple of weeks I am getting used to this camera's quirks. It does really well with Black and White,to the point I shoot mostly everything in BW jpg, with RAW files enabled for converting shots to back to color. Night shooting is OK if you are out and about and run across something, but if you have something specific in mind, I would carry a DSLR for the increased capabilities. As long it is jacket weather I can carry this pretty much anywhere without worrying about a strap or carrying a bag, though it does bulge a bit. The OVF and EVF menus can be glitchy. The main focus point has no problems, but some of the secondary information options sometimes disappear. The histogram does not apparently work in OVF though it seems fine in EVF. It is super easy to accidentally move the shutter speed and exposure compensation dials without noticing so you have to watch your values to make sure nothing got changed before you shoot. Because of the lens set up you really have to keep it protected. To get around carrying the lens cap everywhere, I bought a cheap after market lens hood (I used JJC), removed the hood from the screw on assembly, and placed a cheap 49mm UV filter. Voila no more dealing with the lens cap. The lens profile is only slightly longer, and it still fits in my jacket pocket and looks nice.", "Date": "March 23, 2014"}, {"Title": "Fantastic Images", "Author": "WolfWolf", "ReviewID": "R3PSH6QKK63IMO", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "We are spoiled when it comes to cameras now. There are a million great choices with better ones coming out seemingly every week. Why would you get this camera or the new X100s rather than one that is faster at focusing, has interchangeable lenses, or all the other features you may think you want? I would say simplicity and image quality. With this it is all you have, and all you have to worry about. No additional lenses. Heck, no additional focal lengths through zoom even, so you get used to seeing the world through a 35mm lens (same equivalent as the iPhone for reference). It is also super simple to use. I hear people call it complicated, or you should be a professional photographer to really use it. This is silly. I have never seen a camera have such flawless exposure and white balance. You never really have to fiddle with it. All you do it take pictures and they turn out looking great, easy! All the controls are right there on physical knobs (except ISO, boo Fuji) rather than some toggle or wheel. Again, easy. It is not quick so you have to be a little deliberate but this is far from a bad thing to me.Image quality. Ok, the whole point of having a camera is to capture images of course. This above all else is where it shines. I love the colors and feel of what this camera puts out. People are consistently impressed when they see the pictures. This is right out of the camera, no adjustments from me. That is the really wonderful thing. Maybe I will crop here or there but I am not spending my time having to tweak them. I have friends that take deep pride in their post processing (for good reason since they put out amazing work) but that is not for me. I love to just take pictures and capture moments. This camera, and I am sure its older brother, let me do just that and have truly amazing results.Oh, and yes, it feels super high quality since it is all metal, the lens is amazing, the hybrid viewfinder feels like it is from the future, the flash sink does amazing things, and the shutter is basically silent.

I am deeply in love with my x100. I am so smitten, that as with all true loves, I am blind to my love's shortcomings. Is it slow? Yes. Are the menus infuriating? Yes. Does the manual focus work? No. Is it point and shoot? No. Do you need a degree to understand/use it? Yes. Can it take some of the most compelling, emotional photos that you can ever conceive of? Yes... emphatically so.My god, this camera rules. If you take the time to understand its menus, its function button (a hidden secret), its limitations, its exposure compensation dial, then treasures await. It has utterly fantastic auto white balance, so I keep that set to auto - really, don't play with this. In my opinion, the biggest practical key is the exp. compensation dial. Using the electronic viewfinder, what you see is what you get. Adjust the exp. compensation dial on the fly, and you instantly get a preview in the viewfinder of what the image will look like - unfailingly accurate.The photographs have a special rich color tone that almost no other camera can match. If you like like colors with a rich yet natural saturation, then this is it. The photographs pop right off the scream with a rich luster that is hard to describe. Of all the photographs I make, the consensus is that the pics that come from this camera are the best.Some say that it is too slow. They are right. But when you slow down, you see more and learn more. Do you want fast? Buy a dslr... If you want to take the time to think about what you are doing, if you want a pocketable camera, if you want rich, lustrous photos, then this may be a consideration. Combined with its external flash, it is formidable. In daylight, it works just fine for pics of kids (if you avoid automatic settings).I am now going to upgrade to the x100s.

This camera fills an important void for both my serious photography and more casual shooting.First, the size is important. I need a camera I can have with me when it doesn't make sense to carry around my bigger equipment. While I have had an assortment of point-and-shoot cameras in the past that easily fit in the pocket, this camera doesn't make me trade off creative control and quality to get portability and stealth. The X100 nails most of the important points for creative control (manual focus is a bit useless) but I do find myself really happy having fast access to aperture and shutter speed as well as easy programming for things like bracketing.Everything else about this camera is just bonus after that. The ISO performance on this beats some of my other cameras (like my Canon 7D) by a noticeable margin (not quite on par with my Canon 5DII or the Nikon D3s). So expect some quality improvements when compared to micro-four-thirds cameras. The shutter lag is almost zero and the unit makes almost no noise (I turn off the artificial SFX on things as soon as I turn them on). The viewfinder is very well done and not a gimmick at all. 12MP is plenty for most things though I do sometimes miss the amazing dynamic range that I can get from film.Some of the weaknesses come in the software. Not all the buttons on the device are configurable and slow start-up can leave you standing in the street waiting for your camera to catch-up to the moment. Granted you can turn off deep-sleep mode but that trades the short battery life for even shorter life. Manual focus is software wired so it's not quite as nice as full-time focus you get on other motorized lenses, not to mention it's slow focusing since it takes many full revolutions to move focus end-to-end. Panoramic shooting is cool but seems to get really picking and the internal stitching can end up with lots of artifacts (I'll be sticking to post-process panoramic for anything but casual shots).Overall, I love the form-factor. The fixed lens on this works really well though I do find myself reaching for my other cameras when I have something specific I plan to shoot. All in all, I bought this camera for those moments I can't plan for and it does it's job very well. I hope that future software updates can address the shortcomings.

I think that this is mostly just because of the firmware/software, which is still at a very early version right now. So below I am first covering some of the negatives mostly because I want to finish with the positives. The negatives covered here were observed while using the camera instead of from the feature/specifications list.==FOCUSING==I understand that contrast based auto-focus would be slow and I have no problems accepting that and living with it, but the focusing still suffers from the following 2 class of issues which I think should not be hard to rectify:1) OVF focusing:OVF focusing could have been \"PERFECT\" if the camera always displayed the OVF frame-lines for the current (or last) focus distance when in MF mode. But it does not. You only get the correct frame-lines on shutter half press and then they move back to the default position as soon as you release the button. Whats worse is that the focus point doesn't move with the frame lines, so I'm never really confident of the object under focus. In other words, in situations where the parallax matters you can forget about one click auto-focus with the X100. You will have to use the EVF zoom focus check for important shots. In dynamic shooting situation you will sometimes have to trade-off sharp focus for just getting the shot. This overall is not a terrible thing, but its just something that could be fixed in software.2) Manual focusing:As expected low light auto-focusing is not one of the strengths of this camera, especially when you have the auto-focus assist light turned off for stealth. So the manual focus ring along with the distance display is a great idea for such situations.  But the FREAKIN focus ring is so slow that it takes ages to pre-focus the camera to a particular distance. I can understand the need for smaller steps when in the macro focus range but for non-macro use this is just unacceptable. The user should be allowed to pick how much rotation (with the option of setting it to less than 1 turn for the full range) covers the non-macro focus. An extra treat would to zoom into the distance scale for macro focus. Again I expect this to be something that can be fixed in software.==INTERFACE==1) Auto Manual ISO toggle:There is no way to quickly toggle between auto and manual ISO. Again this would be something fixable in software.2) Dedicated controls for second level features:I like the dedicated controls for aperture, shutter and shutter compensation. But allowing users to quickly modify the second level exposure control depends on the shooting situation is also important and sadly somewhat lacking in this camera. Adding this kind of flexibility to the interface allows different people with different usage patterns to quickly adjust the interface to match their needs. The RAW button really should mean giving more RAW control over the camera. I know I'm not being very specific because I haven't completely thought through the possible list of suggestions here.3) Slowness:Pretty much any kind of mode change takes around 1 second (or maybe a little less than a second). Some of these are acceptable and other arent. And I'm pretty sure that not all of the interface slowness is necessary, and some of it might be fixable in software. Closing the viewfinder curtain in some situations doesn't really seem necessary. I think taking another pass at fixing some of this slowness will be useful.==JAPAN==I am amazed at how quickly Fuji delivered the camera pre-orders even after the massive natural disaster in JAPAN. The resilience of the people behind this effort is unbelievable.==HAPPY THINGS==An amazing amount of engineering and planning went into bringing this camera to life, especially being the first entry product by Fuji in a segment completely new to them. So I want to briefly mention some of the things about this camera that make me happy:0. I am able to achieve better results with long-exposures when hand holding the X100 compared to a DSLR1. I am very happy with the sharpness and color rendition of the photos & the low light high ISO performance2. I am delighted with the super awesome ultra quiet operation and the compact size3. I am happy with the OVF and EVF. I was expect 0.5x magnification to be somewhat dismal but it feels pretty good to me.4. It fits my hands well and most of the buttons are easy to get toThe camera is still at firmware 1.01 and with some more software changes Fuji can make this a 5 star product (at least for me).Please FUJI.

This means I had a bit over a month to get used to it.  Coming from film Leica bodies (and as a Nikon full-frame dSLR shooter) I learned NOT to expect the same things I could from any other of my trusted cameras.  For instance, not to expect a reliable, fast shutterspeed when the camera is in aperture-priority and the lens wide open.  Also, I learned to be VERY careful about touching buttons in the back.  Another thing was that I did have problems with my computer (Apple MacBook) reading .jpg files from this camera.  Finally, that there was a considerable difference between the image on my computer screen and the one on the print (even more than with my Nikon-made images).  However, I did like the fact that focusing is fairly quick, that one can easily tell the camera which focus point to use in order to do some types of shots (especially moving subjects), that the automatic white balance and high ISO are both remarkably good and that the camera is relatively inconspicuous (I did take it with on a trip through Nuremberg, Prague and Bamberg), and, believe it or not, fairly tought (it took a tumble off a chair and the lens hood ended up very slightly bent).

I bought this camera because I needed a high quality camera that I could take in place of my heavy 50d setup. I don't think I could have been happier with my choice. One of the Amazon reviews helped me to make my decision.Firstly let me say this camera is not for everyone. It does take time to learn this camera and all of its functions. I actually read the manual!Once you understand how to focus, then you can free up your mind to really focus on your exposure and composition. Which is why anyone buys a rangefinder: to focus on your composition and exposure. I used this camera everywhere. Parties, long walks, dinners, barbeques.Good sides: LIGHT, COMPACT. Great exposure control. I could go from high ISO high DOf to low DOF low ISo shots in a matter of seconds. Good lens. Its no Leica, but this lens does well none the less. Great Flash exposure, and film settings. The camera itself with the leather casing is absolutely gorgeous, classic in the front, digital in the back. I got so many compliments on the camera, I couldn't help wear it as a functional fashion accesory. Also, the HD filming is pretty awesome.The bad sides: I am so glad I bought an extra battery, I cycles throughthese batteries so easily. 200 shots and I am switcing to thr next battery. Actually, everyday I swapped batteries. Fuji could have done better here. Low light focusing is a huge challenge for this camera. I would have to get creative to find ways to let the camera focusing. I am not a fan of the manual focus. I feel the start time is way slow. I still canot figure out how the camera focuses during video filming. I almost the lens cap a few times. Really these are minor compared to the freedom the camera gave me over my 50d.I am an experienced rangefinder user, I miss using my Bessa r3a, but she broke. I look foreward to carrying this camera with me everywhere, getting back to my suttle street photography style of shooting.", "Date": "September 25, 2011"}, {"Title": "If it was only based on looks", "Author": "S. Lee", "ReviewID": "R3441677EMDBEV", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "If it was on looks alone then this camera will be worth every penny but that is not the case.  Although it does have a APS-C sensor which is even slightly bigger than the 7D's, this camera does not have a processor that can handle like a DSLR.  What I'm trying to say is that this camera is bloody slow to react.  I feel like I'm spending most of my time waiting and waiting for this camera to either load up or finish writing onto the card.  Another annoying fact is the issue with parallax where what you see in the OVF is not the actual image the lens see, for that you'll have to switch to the EVF.  This problem is more apparent for subjects that is closer than 2 meters which most of the time it is because of the fixed focal length of equivalent 35mm.  Therefore, when shooting at apertures of 2-2.8 and with a distance of less than 2 meters, one is better off using the EVF because if he uses the OVF then instead of the eyes being in focus, the person's nose will be in focus and the eyes will be out of focus.Enough ranting on the camera,  did not buy this camera to replace my DSLR and I would not suggest anyone to do so.  If this is your first camera then don't bother or if you are upgrading from a point and shoot camera but dislike to learn new things or refuse to use functions other than AUTO then don't bother.  This camera is really intended for those that are either looking for a backup camera for their DSLRs (I'm in this category), or for those that are ready to replace their old film camera for a brand new digital camera with a retro design.This is a nice camera if you don't mind its snail like processing or the hassle of switching between OVF and EVF everytime you get close to your subjects.  I personally find this camera extremely attractive and find it hard to send it back after waiting close to 4 months for it but the more I use it, the more I cons I seem to find and it's really discouraging at times when I'm trying to weigh out the pros and cons of this camera.Here's my list so far;Pros:Looks (5 stars)Handling (5 stars)Picture quality (still a step below my 7D) (3.5 stars)Cons:Slow (2 stars)Price (3.5 stars)Lack of accessories (everything costs $$ and they're all on back order) (3.5 stars)Parallax with OVF (3 stars)Did I mention SLOW (2 stars)Average - 3 stars", "Date": "May 6, 2011"}, {"Title": "Love it (updated - see review)", "Author": "Dan G. Hiris", "ReviewID": "R35BN8QRCKAP33", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Got this camera finally after waiting for it for a long long time. Always wanted a proper digital range-finder but Nikon and Canon, who are my choice companies for cameras, didn't bother to work one out. Leica has astronomic prices so I won't even bother.My last review was very \"first impression\" but now after I got to learn ways around its limitations, I'm ready to re-review it.To start, the camera looks gorgeous. The gun-metal gray in the body is very nice even though for stealthiness I would have preferred it to be darker. Fortunately it's not very shiny.The lens of the camera, being the 35 mm equivalent of 35 mm was my main reason for getting this camera as my only 35 mm equivalent choice for the D7000 were the extremely expensive and huge 24 mm f/1.4 Nikon or the 24 mm f/2.8 Nikon lenses. The first one would have cost almost twice the price of this camera and for reportage, it would have stood out like a pink elephant in times square. Unless people taking pictures of you is your genre, forget that setup.The hybrid viewfinder (digital/optical) is decent but in optical it is impossible to manually focus as everything looks well, in focus and there's no middle piece showing overlapping images. As for the electronic viewfinder, which helps find your focus, I'm unimpressed. Seems like one of those tv glasses you can connect your iPod to so the resolution is poor and going from frame to frame, there is considerable lag and tracing going on. When trying to find your focus through the magnification function, you have to have a very stable hand. When turning the MF dial, the focusing mechanism seems quite loud and frail and the focus changes very slowly which changes if you turn it faster but it's very awkward. What does help with MF is using the auto-focus assist button to help you get closer to the ideal focus and then manually fine tune it. It's still a pain because the focus dial is slow to move back and forth and the resolution/refresh time of the screen. I read somewhere that the prototype of this camera would show you green outline of the subject in focus. Not so in the production version.The auto focus is actually quite good. It works better in the dark than the Nikon D7000 which can't auto-focus it's way out of anything which requires ISO higher than 800.Being able to see Black and white in the electronic viewfinder when selecting that film type is really cool.In my previous review, I was complaining about speed. Now, after getting faster memory, it is faster and decent considering its size. I use 45 Mb/s memory but I think the most it can take advantage of is Class 10 as it is not UHS compatible.As for other functions, it has Auto ISO, even though not as smart as Nikon's (can't go over ISO 3200, and it always starts at ISO 200) You don't really want to go over ISO 3200. Noise at that level looks a bit much and clearly not as clean as I've seen in other online reviews of this camera. It's actually slightly worse than the D7000 so a D90 would probably be a good comparison. The noise on this does look more like film grain than digital noise. A big plus I think.A few other pet peeves are the lack of an IR remote, lack of accessories supplied, or available at this time, like a proper leather case, the ring adapter (even though I'm going to remove the glass out of a 49 mm fluorescent filter which I don't use and use that as the extension so that the focus mechanism can operate with a UV filter on.)Everything else works as expected with really nice external controls for shutter speed, exposure compensation, switches and buttons well thought out.

Have used it for a number of months now. I am mostly a landscape photo taker using this camera on hikes and climbs and bought it to take on a Himalayan expedition where I can't take my Canon 5D and associated heavy lenses. Also can't afford to take bad pictures with cheaper point and shoots.You have most likely read all the good things about this camera so I'll focus on the things that bug me and may bug you.Build:Excellent body quality. It has a solid feel in the hand and the look is very retro in looks and quality build. There are some cheap parts like the control dial that take away from this being perfect as far as overall build goes.Controls:The thing about this camera is that the controls feel cheap. The on/off switch goes to on without you knowing it because it's loose which can drain some battery before automatically going to sleep.Same thing with the control dial. You don't know if you're turning anything unless you look at the screen and seeing something's changed and it's cheap plastic! Totally offsets the solid feel of the rest of the camera.. The menu/ok button is way too small and gives you no feedback as to if you're pushing it or one of the 4 directional buttons on the control dial. With my bare fingers I have a hard time getting the right button. Even more difficult if you have thin liner gloves and forget it if you have medium weight or mountaineering gloves.The exposure compensation dial also revolves way too easily and I often find that I've taken the wrong exposure.The fn button is way too small.The other buttons and controls are spaced enough apart to use with gloves. Nice.The controls should have more resistance like DSLR's!Having said this, I think it's still the camera for me as I can take pictures and set the aperture and shutter speed with gloves on. I just have to forget all the other settings while I'm up on the mountain like changing ISO. I may need to invest in a larger shutter button attachment. There should be plenty options as it accepts old style releases.Handling:Works fairly well with bare hands, almost the same with thin liner gloves, somewhat difficult with anything thicker than that other than basic picture taking controls (see previous on that). The fact that no controls require electrical resistance of your hand is great for us who have gloves on much of the time.Exposure:Auto exposure doesn't work all that well many times so I find myself using manual mode and adjusting on the fly so although ok for still, landscape shots is not good for anything that requires timing and one chance. Not good for novice photographers.Viewfinder:I use the OVF almost exclusively. It's just simple and already being used to one with my DSLR I prefer it. I also use the hybrid OVF/EVF sometimes to view the photo settings and horizontal level (handy feature!). Also most importantly it works with sunglasses on. The rear screen is too hard to see with a set of dark glacier glasses.Photo Quality:Great. As everyone else has already stated. The Velvia setting with the higher saturation tuning is what you'll want for outdoor pics as it renders your jpg pic in more dynamic colors but make non mistake, it's not Velvia film quality. Nothing digital can do what that film does. Take your compact film camera if you're looking for that quality. I'm almost tempted to.Lens:Kind of bummed that it won't accept a telephoto or zoom because some shots require you to zoom in like those 8000ers way out in the distance, but the 35mm equiv. integrated prime is good for keeping it weather resistant and is the focal length that is the quite useful compromise for many landscape photos.Overall:Unfortunately there's still no perfect compact/excellent picture quality camera for mountaineers. This I believe is the closest but still far from perfect. When I first saw that this camera had all manual controls I was hyped but... it's almost a killer. I'll keep mine and it will get plenty of use as I can get some great shots but I wouldn't recommend it for those who are stretching to pay the hefty premium. Just live with the substandard pics of cheaper cameras.For non-mountaineers, it's still great for stills and portraits. Great for foodies as well as the auto white balance works pretty well and it has a fast lens and takes good pics at high ISO levels so is good for low light. Not good for action shots at all though. You can look through the OVF and take a picture by accident with the lens cap on and then have to wait minutes before you can take an actual shot...

It is easy to use, especially coming from a film camera background.  There are some poorly arranged menus, but it has manual analog dials for many functions, which is a good thing.

It has good auto white balance, great fill flash, and usable auto ISO (high ISOs are great)and auto dynamic range functions.  It does an above average job with colors and especially brown colors, but it is still a digital camera and Bayer interpolation takes its toll on virtually every digital camera, especially when compared to film (or reality).The problems are as follows: The manual focus is not really usable.  The lens, though very good, is fixed at a 35mm camera equivalent of 35mm, which is somewhat wide angle.  The fixed lens is limiting, especially for a relatively low resolution media where it is best to fill the frame with subject to maximize resolution.  Also, the camera must be changed to macro mode to focus at an image scale that is frequently used (again because of the 35mmeq. lens).  This makes use cumbersome.

In certain situations my Nikon J1 gave me a better quality photos than X100.Focus is good for portraits but not good enough when taking pictures of your kids. if you have kids and you want family camera, its hard to recommend this camera, focus is a little slow. I think my Canon s95 that i bought for $300 is faster than X100. Which to me is not acceptable if i pay $1,200 for a camera. It should be at least as good as point a shoot camera, in my opinion. I liked a lot of things about this camera to want to buy a newer version, X200 maybe. with faster focus, and tillable lcd screen like in NEX-7 or Olympus E-M5.

The first thing I'll say is that the images are stunning. They compare favorably in every way with every camera that I can personally compare to (Olympus E510, Canon S90, Nikon D90), and with shots taken by others that have been posted to galleries. The images are, subjectively, unsurpassed.The various flaws reported by others are definitely there, but I find that I can mostly ignore them, considering the quality of the results. I haven't hit that nasty shutter defect - that obviously can't be ignored, and worries me (but it's not my camera ...).Will I buy this camera? No. Mainly because I'm not a professional. For almost all of what I do, an excellent P&S; like the Canon S90 (which I own), or S95 or S100 is fine. On the few occasions where I've had to do \"professional\" work (artists' portfolios), I might've appreciated and benefited from the X100, but made do quite nicely with an Olympus E510. Even the Canon S90 was up to the task (thanks to the possibility to process its RAW images with Adobe and DxO software to calibrate color, and to correct for vignetting and barrel distortion). For my personal camera, I need zoom and a smaller size. So I can't justify this price for something that I can't use all the time. If I had that kind of money, I might be looking at a Leica (but I've seen several reviews saying the X100 is easily the equal of those, and I can believe it now). But those are not flaws of this camera, and are not why I give it four stars. They're just why it's not for me.I rate this camera four stars not so much for the price alone, which is easily justified by the images, or because it's not the perfect camera for me, but because there are just a few too many quirks for the price (slow write speed and clunky UI being my biggest complaints). All of which could possibly be fixed with firmware updates, but, for some reason, haven't been. It's actually better than four stars - 4.5 I'd say - but I can't give it a 5.

(Caution it gets a bit techy, but these are all genuine issues I have noted within the first week of ownership)When in OVF mode, the focus point around under the \"Area Focus\" command why does the white key-line that denotes the edge of the image disappear, and only reappear when you stop holding down the AF key? Its important to be able to see how the focus point you are using relates to the actual \"Image area\"Would it be possible to have the option to see your most recent image (Image Display) on the LCD, without it delaying use of the eyepiece as currently occurs. Sometimes you just need to stay with the action, and sometimes it nice to be able to \"chimp\" a little. I can't see why they have been made mutually exclusive?The ISO Auto Control feature is very helpful, but would be so much more useful if it had more flexibility. For example:Why not allow users to set a higher Max Sensitivity? there are times when the flexibility would make life so much easier!This is especially important in relation to the minimum shutter speed setting. where if I have it set at say 1/80 and the ISO jumps to 3200, my shutter speed falls to what ever is required (even like 1/10 sec or less) this is not practical in many situations. Much better that say if because of low light, you hit your low shutter speed (say 1/80) then having the camera go up to an even higher ISO would be more useful than a very slow shutter speed. Or at least the operator has the option to use it this way!when in Multi AF Mode, why not show where the camera is placing its focus points (much like many SLR's do) this way users would feel much more comfortable with how the camera is assessing the scene. At present it feels very \"hit & miss\"In good / strong sunlight when using the OVF, the white \"frame line, the focus point crosses and the gree focus box all become very pale, and difficult to see. Can they be made stronger? Not being able to see them properly again slows down user decisions and adds more guesswork than should be needed.When in EVF mode, and you depress the shutter half way to get focus, the image in the viewfinder becomes \"jittery\" and lags your movement (say to follow the action) so much so that when you click the shutter it is exceptionally hard to make a proper judgement of what you have captured. Why the jittery time delay? This (apart from the graininess of the image in the viewfinder is a major weakness of the EVF, and seems a really basic error to have allowed through quality control.Why does the View finder default to a \"Closed off\" position, that only opens when you half depress the shutter. This again means a user cannot quickly start to \"frame\" the image he/she wishes to capture. If you add onto this the time taken to say position the focus points, then the delay is substantial. Much better that the Viewfinder is open to allow instantaneous viewing.When in MF and focusing on something quite close the image frame jumps to the left & down ( due to parallax) but in doing it its bottom edge disappears behind the Manual focus Indicator bar, making proper Framing of the scene very difficult.Why can't users use any of the function buttons whilst the camera is processing the images just taken? Its like waiting for an old PC to boot up! Surely there can be some sort of multi-tasking that the processor can do, so users don't have to stand there waiting for all the churning & flashing lights to stop!? Another substantial inconvenience.IN EVF mode the image seen in the viewfinder is exactly as seen in the final image, but in OVF mode the image as seen framed by the white box (even after adjusting for parallax) is smaller than teh final image appears, when you are trying hard to get the \"perfect\" composition you don't want the final image to appear a different size!If using the camera in \"no volume\" mode, it would be really handy to have some sort of visual cue to let you know exactly when the shutter clicks. this is especially important in EVF mode due to the jittery images as mentioned above.The X100 has some terrific points, but many significant issues to be resolved if it really is to be taken seriously. I am overall disappointed that Fuji put out a potentially great camera with so many obvious limitations. Contrary to appearances, this is not an exhaustive list of issues, its just the ones that cause me the most hassle, there are other general software headache problems too!

My interest was primarily motivated by the emotional appeal of its retro appearance that reminded me of days long gone by, and by reviews that stressed the quality of photos taken with it.I returned the camera for a full refund within a week, for the following factual reasons:1. Cute as it may be, that camera has no zoom functionality. Yes, I knew that when I bought it, but I underestimated how much I have come to expect it in a camera. A fixed wide angle lens cannot take portraits without distorting them. A fixed wide angle lens cannot be used in your kids' games. It cannot be used in 99% of the situations that one is in, unless one's interests are limited to scenery photography and one happens to be at just the right distance from what it being photographed.2. There is no image stabilization. Granted, it is less needed at wide angles than at telephoto focal lengths, but this is making a virtue out of necessity. Even at wide angles, one does need image stabilization when there is not enough light.3. There is too much noise (image noise, that is) at low light. ISO settings at 6400 are way too noisy to be useful.4. The menu is quirky and unintuitive.If and when an X-100 Mark 8 comes out (after 8 evolutionary cycles) that fixes those problems, then I would become interested.
