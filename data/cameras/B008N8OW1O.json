For the money, you probably won't find a better camera than this.  It uses an SD memory card (not provided) and two AA batteries (also not provided).  But it does include a USB cable for connecting to your computer so you can download and edit your photos.  If you have a Mac with iPhoto, that's all you need to do.  If you have a PC, you'll probably have to install the provided software.", "Date": "September 14, 2012"}, {"Title": "Good cheap camera", "Author": "usa", "ReviewID": "R23ZA1OK0FGS5S", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This is the second one I bought. The first one is still working amid kid abuse. I bought both of these for my little boys and they love them-- so easy to use and durable. And it can save you hundreds in repairs if you have kids and an expensive camera--give them this one and maybe they will leave yours alone.", "Date": "August 20, 2013"}, {"Title": "Works well", "Author": "Shirley J.

However, the software that came with it so I could transfer the pictures to my computer now \"quits unexpectedly\" and I am no longer able to view, print or transfer any of the photos that are my computer.  When I notified Vivitar support dept., they offered no solution to my problem.  I will never get another vivitar camera again.", "Date": "November 19, 2013"}, {"Title": "Great little camera...", "Author": "Philip Leete", "ReviewID": "R1TT7O0FKAPRF9", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "We got this for our nephew.  He is 6 years old.Note: I am not giving this 5 stars because I had assumed that the 100 picture ability in the advertisement meant that it's internal memory was enough to hold some photos.  Not the case.  I found an old 1G SD card and then got 707 pictures at the highest resolution.  So that was more then okay.The 4.1 mega pixels looks great on my computer, even when I zoom in.  I have not tried printing but don't foresee any issues.  The lack of flash does mean that it's low light is not so great but you get a much longer battery life with out it.  Over all, it's a great little camera.  I hope it is slightly shock resistant but only time will tell how it holds up to a 1st grader's abuse.", "Date": "July 31, 2013"}, {"Title": "Not good", "Author": "Irene", "ReviewID": "R39SV1Y2948Y5O", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "Purchased together with an sd card that amazon bundled with it, and the camera was not even working.it said card error, and it took one photo, that is it.
