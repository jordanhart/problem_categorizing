I really do mean thrilled with the performance. The video will give you more details on the functionality - but below is a summary of my likes and dislikes.Pros- Highly sensitive microphone- Low light capability- Very easy set-up- Will interface with your television - will allow for a split screen using your picture-in-picture.- Works with a recording device - a DVR, VCR, or other devices.- Alarm for any changes in status - if it detects movement or sound- Decent range (Not great but not bad)- Monitor will support up to 4 camerasCons-- Need to watch for audio feedback if the monitor gets to close to the camera (It could wake a baby) ... note that this is standard for any audio equipment if the receiver gets to close to the source.- A bigger screen would be nice - if I was trying to find something to complain aboutFinal Verdict-  Great product at a reasonable price - the Lorex LW2002W is a easy product to review and enjoy!5 stars", "Date": "June 27, 2009"}, {"Title": "So, so as a baby monitor", "Author": "ChillyLos", "ReviewID": "R7BBU15URQMFR", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "After doing quite a bite of research for a baby video monitor I narrowed it down to the Lorex LW2002W Digital and the Summer Infant Best View Digital. I wanted digital because I have had problems with interference with my old monitor.Both have many similar features but I initially purchased the Lorex with 2 cameras over the Summer Infant because of the automatic cycling between cameras feature and AV port feature. With a lot of monitors if you have more than one camera hooked up you have to manually switch from one camera to the other.  I have 2 small kids and I need to monitor them both. With the Lorex you can set it to automatically switch b/w cameras about every 5-8 sec. Also the Lorex has an AV port connection that allows you to connect the monitor to your TV.The Lorex is a quality video monitor for the the price. However, after using the Lorex I sent it back because of one feature my wife and I did not like.  It automatically mutes the sound if the noise in the room is below a certain level. When the sound in the room gets above that level the audio comes back on. Lorex customer service told me that the feature prevents listener from hearing a soft hissing sound (white noise) in the receiver when the monitor room is quiet. You can't disable this feature.Don't get me wrong, it does pick up most sounds such as normal conversation, walking on hardwood, crying, something dropping on the floor, etc.  But it does not pick up very soft sounds like a baby breathing, whispering or walking on carpet.  This may sound trivial but at night while I'm sleeping great audio is important. It's usually the audio that alerts me that something is going on in the room. Then I look at the video to determine if it's trouble or not.After returning the Lorex I purchased 2 Summer Infant Best Views to monitor both my kids at the sametime. I was unable to find a monitor in the <$200 range that met all my need, so this was my compromise. Fortunately I was able to get both of them at the same price (on Amazon) that I purchased the one Lorex with 2 cameras. The Summer Infant does not have the auto camera cycling and the AV connection but it does have a very nice pan & tilt feature that allows you to scan almost the entire room and the audio is very good. You can hear a baby breathing.The Lorex is better suited for people who are looking for a reasonably priced (not cheap) low interference video monitor to monitor older toddlers, their property or for parents who don't feel they need a continuous sound feature. One of the previous reviewers stated she uses her Lorex with her old audio monitor and it works well.", "Date": "August 7, 2009"}, {"Title": "Excellent system, good value", "Author": "AlexL", "ReviewID": "RP6TAUQOK6K6D", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I looked at the other two similar systems available and this one is the best in my opinion:Setup is extremely easy - charge and turn on. Picture quality both day and night vision are excellent.Camera can be rotated at good variety of angles and can be battery powered (though night vision would drain batteries quickly).It's digital, so neighbors can't see your cameras and you can't see theirs instead of yours.What differentiated this from the other ones for me was:1) availability of additional cameras, up to 4 that can be monitored from same receiver, and2) this system uses Frequency Hopping Spread Spectrum technology, so it can co-exist with your 802.11b/g access points. I was able to use my laptop over 802.11g just fine while using the camera receiver right next to it.", "Date": "September 7, 2008"}, {"Title": "Great Product with one AMAZINGLY STUPID FLAW", "Author": "Daniel Keith", "ReviewID": "R34S17SSMUDM9Z", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "This video monitor is - by far - the best on the market with the exception of one issue.  Seriously, my wife and I have have hunted, researched, and tested more than we care to admit and this is the best in almost every way. It has the best picture, the best system of connecting everything, the longest A/V cord, a recharging stand, and brilliant syncing when the portable receiver is placed in the stand (without having to connect/reconnect any cords: genius!).So, why would I give it ONE star? Because ALL of these qualities are completely trumped by one \"feature\" that obliterates the value of the product.  Specifically, it has an \"audio auto-off\" function that only plays sound over a specific volume. But, that's no problem, we'll just turn that feature off...Oh, wait! what?!? you can't turn that feature off??? That's just stupid. We are not the type of parents that rush into our baby's room over every sound he makes (in fact, we are probably too willing to let his crying escalate before intervening).  However, I do not want some gadget dictating when I can and cannot hear my son.As well thought out as this video monitor is, this one feature - I suspect - is the product of OVER-thinking. It's a hideous and horrible mistake. This monitor would have earned five stars, but for this one, tragic flaw.

We settled on the Lorex, and are quite happy, but wanted to report pros and cons for the sake of others struggling to choose:Pros:--clear picture--instant pairing of camera to receiver--good packaging and instructions--solid feel--cameras and receiver use the same, small 9V AC adapter; receiver can be charged on or off its home base.--doesn't look like scary spy equipment--cute feature of being able to turn on the nightlight on the camera from the receiver. If someone waves for help, you can signal that you're on your way.--bright red LED's to indicate sound being received--grabs your attention nicely if you're sitting quietly reading while baby's in another room asleep.--cameras run well on 4 rechargeable AA batteries--night and low-light performance are amazing, and the infrared lights are completely unobtrusiveCons:--turns on at full volume, so that if monitor and receiver are in the same room, feedback can result. This is not fun at night when trying to use the monitor to help baby and partner sleep.--related to this, there is no mute--you can turn the sound sensitivity and alarm volumes down, but can never be sure they are OFF.--buttons on edges of device are too easily pressed by accident.--camera units are very slighly top-heavy.--slick, rounded profile of receiver is slippery; doesn't stand up well; slides around on bed or couch.Hope this helps,SanjayCambridge, Mass.", "Date": "January 3, 2010"}, {"Title": "Wow - How Stupid is this?", "Author": "Savvy Net Consumer", "ReviewID": "R2K15PBSBA3I8J", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I don't usually bother writing too many reviews but I had to with this one. This product seemed to have good reviews so I bought one. The first night, it worked great and then 2nd night, the signal kept dropping from the camera to the receiver. And no, it doesn't make any sound or warning when the signal drops. It is used for the baby's room so it is a critical piece of equipment for our family. The signal dropping was intermittent and I tried pairing the receiver to the camera, reboot, etc... and finally gave up. I called customer support and they said that if I have a wireless phone at home, to turn it off and it will work right. There is no documentation or warning on this in any of their manuals. So, I asked, \"let me get this straight - I can use this system but I can't have my phone on\"... answer \"Uhh.. yeah\". Stupid!!!!!!

I know it might sound silly - but the first time he saw them - he freaked out, totally. Now he  does not let me turn the camera his way, so I basically have an audio monitor for now. I'm hoping to convince him not to be scared so I can see him, but he won't give up yet. To mention - they do look spooky those small bright red dots in the circle... My son told me they also made a beep, but this is unverified :)-  Sound mutes when baby is quiet and then suddenly comes on when it loses signal or baby stirs. This sometimes shakes me a little when I'm in the quiet room.-  Range is not that great. In my 5,000 sq.ft 2-story house I have quite a few \"low signal\" and \"no signal\" zones.

I'm just like you... researching and trying to decide which baby monitor is the best. I've come to a conclusion, and I'm posting this simply with the hope that you might not have to spend 5 hours of your life doing what I just did. In other words, hours ago I wish I could have read someone's \"Summary of User Reviews\". So, if it helps, great. If it doesn't, sorry... just trying to help.After reading dozens and dozens of reviews at various websites (including Amazon) I've decided that this Lorex baby monitor (model Lw2002 in either white or black; thus model Lw2002W or Lw2002B) is the best monitor out there for several reasons. However, as we'll see, it's not perfect.  First, the good news.PROS:1.  Very clear daylight picture.2.  Clear sound.3.  Infrared \"Night\" vision or dark mode that is quite clear.4.  Motion and/or sound detection triggering an audible alarm/beep/video image at the monitor.5.  Security of signal frequency hopping digital transmission. (So the neighbor's baby monitor can't see or hear your baby.)6.  Because of the signal's digital frequency hopping (1000 times per second) the device is very unlikely to interfere  with, or suffer from interference from, your wireless router, cordless phones, microwave oven, etc.7.  Support for up to 4 cameras; all can be viewed on the same handheld monitor.8.  Auto-switching mode, for switching between multiple cameras (if you have more than one) every few seconds.9.  Remotely controllable (from the handheld monitor) night-light.10. Ability to output video to a TV or video recorder. (e.g. set it up as a picture-in-picture while  you're watching your favorite TV program.)11. Ease of setup. (Simply plug it into your house power outlet - or charge and use the batteries - and you're done.)12. Reasonably low price.Now the bad news. Although the majority of users find the product usable, and many find it ideal, the following areas are the 4 most consistently repeated of the complaints voiced by users in the countless reviews I've read. If you can live with these few product deficiencies, then this very well may be the best baby monitor for you too.CONS: 1. Automute: By far, the number one complaint that people have is that they cannot set the sound to stay on all the time. The monitor will silence itself (mute sound and turn off the screen) if there isn't any \"significant\" audio or motion coming from the baby's room after a certain period of time (e.g. 10 seconds) but will of course turn on again if there is a \"significant\" sound or motion such as a baby talking, crying or moving. Again, this feature can't be disabled. However, to the manufacturer's credit this sensitivity is adjustable, and apparently, the device will still flash red lights (from one to several - depending on the intensity of the sound) as sounds are detected, even when the monitor is muted.The device designer's idea, as stated by them, is to allow the parents to sleep without the white noise \"hiss\" that would exist with constant reproduction of a \"quiet\" room's sound.  But many people find the sensitivity adjustment to be insufficient and wish that they could set the monitor to relay sound or picture ALL the time. (At the very least sound.)  In fact, many feel that the suddenness of the device turning on and relaying sounds is more alarming than the constant \"hiss\" and/or noise of the child would be. As a result, these people find this muting \"feature\" to be disturbing and would clearly prefer to hear every sound and rely on their own brain to detect abnormalities in the child's environment or breathing, etc.For some, they work around this by using another traditional sound only baby monitor to listen to the child, then, if they hear something unusual, they grab the Lorex monitor and turn it on to see what the child is up to. Not so elegant, but it works.It's worth noting that this issue, which many consider to be a key design flaw, would be an extremely easy fix for Lorex to implement; simply add a \"sound always on\" and \"video always on\" setting to the setup screen. Hey Lorex, how about a firmware update!? 2. Beeping Upon Button Use: The handheld monitor beeps \"loudly\" every time you press any button when using it.  This annoys a number of people because it wakes their sleeping spouse next to them during the night when they are using the baby monitor to check on the child.  This could be easily fixed by Lorex by implementing a mute, or volume setting in the monitor's setup screen. Hey Lorex, how about a firmware update!? 3. Bad Button Placement: The relative ease with which certain buttons (e.g. specifically the power on/off button) can be inadvertently pressed. Some people complain that the buttons are just placed poorly, and shouldn't be put where they're easily and accidently pressed when picking up the device. 4. Battery Life: Although both the camera, and the handheld monitor come with plug-in AC power adapters, many people feel that the device (particularly the handheld monitor) is short on battery life. They feel that the 2.5 to 3 hours of run time (approximately) is insufficient.  Personally, I feel it's on par with such a power hungry video wireless device. Of course this isn't as easy of a fix as the first two issues (which would only require a firmware update), but of course this too could be remedied by the addition of a larger more powerful lithium ion rechargeable battery.(It should be noted that the use of batteries in the camera, particularly during the dark when the camera's infrared lights will automatically turn on, is also very short.

I was warned about this from other reviews, but I thought I could deal with not hearing the very small noises. The first time I used it was during my 3 month old daughter's nap. I placed the camera about four feet away from her and set it on the highest sensitivity. I heard her crying from across my 1800 sq foot house and the monitor did not pick it up. Later, I tried this monitor out on my two year old son. I entered his room after an hour to find him awake and playing with toys, and the monitor never once went out of auto shutoff mode!

I couldn't!All those design flows  turned out to be major inconveniences/annoyances, making this otherwise technologically sound product unusable. I used it for a month, couldn't stand it anymore. Had to return.Pros: Digital \"spread\" signal : no interference with wireless internet, no security problems.CONS:  -Signal is not strong enough for a basic 3 bedroom apartment on one floor in wooden house. The signal indicator is a gimmick: goes from full strength to low or no signal in a  moment.  -On-Off button: Horrible placement - no matter how careful I handled the receiver it shuts off. And when you turn it back on again it emits loud beeps (even if you previously mute the volume) The result is at night you end up waking up everybody. ( Also imagine: you hear the baby's noise, grab the receiver to see what's going on, and this thing just shuts off!)  -Receiver's connection to the charging cradle is designed very poorly. You have to put down  the receiver very carefully - otherwise it is not charging. And after a couple of weeks the wire contacts in the base got bent, so there was no charging at all. Those hair-wire contacts are very fragile.  - The camera stand design is very bad. No matter how you twist it it is next to impossible to aim the camera at the proper angle. Also attaching the camera is a major hassle: The base is too thick to use any clips. Screwing it to the wall does not give good aiming in my case. Tried to attach it to a small piece of plywood... C'mon, this is nonsense for $150 hi tech product.  -Both chargers have very short cords. This is a major problem for camera: Extension cord is too heavy and pulls the  camera off-angle.  -Battery saving mode is very poorly designed and cannot be  override: The unit turns on when detecting movement, but then turns off again no matter if there is more \"action\".  -when using the camera with AA batteries: the battery life is very poor and there is no warning of \"low battery power\". Also cannot be used in low light while battery powered.  -Some smaller issues:  -The light-on button is poorly placed-will accidently switch on-off all the time.  -The receiver's center of gravity is too high, so one has to be very careful when standing the unit down - it flips very easily.  -The color is a joke- the picture is mostly the same as black-and-white.So the bottom line : the Cons make this unit a pain-in-the-neck.

Finding a good system that will work when the parent is in a different house isn't easy.  Mom lives in the house right next door to us....about 35 feet away.  Still, most baby monitors won't work if the \"range\" is obstructed.  I talked to ADT security which has wonderful systems...if you want to spend several thousand dollars.  I tried another baby monitor which didn't work....so started looking into larger systems from Lorex.  I had it narrowed down to two, each with 4 wireless cameras and DVR/Internet box, etc.  Then this portable monitor caught my eye.  After reading the reviews I was certain it wouldn't work.  But I decided that returning things to Amazon.com is so easy I had nothing to lose.  I'm so glad I decided to try it !!!  I'm thrilled with it !!!  The camera portion is now sitting in Mom's living room..about 45 feet from the front of our home.  The monitor is next to me....in my bedroom which is on the second floor of our home.  Mom's house is a double....the \"other side\" is empty and is the side that is between Mom and our home !!  So we're most definately NOT unobstructed !!!

We used it in a number of situations to get a feel for its capabilities.  These included using it as a straight up baby monitor and using it as a camera to monitor the exterior of our home (from the inside and then from a sheltered area).The picture clarity is very good - although the range can be, at times, marginal (trouble holding a signal from 20 ft. or so) - the same can be said of the sound quality.  The night vision is excellent - however, the infrared lights, when reflected back by a window or mirror, cause a glare that makes it impossible to see.  There is no way to turn off the infrared lighting.  The batteries in the camera do not last long and one should not expect to use the camera for an extended period of time by means of the battery (if you could turn off the infrared lights, it might help there too).  The battery on the receiving handset works pretty well.  The sensitivity to \"wake\" the monitor was handy and worked well.  Construction was generally good, but we have had some issues with the power supply for the camera unit - it no longer works and appears to be an internal connection issue in the camera itself.  It's probably an easy solder fix and may be the result of us having moved it from place to place or from the kids mucking around with it (once the kids in your baby room get mobile, these kinds of things are investigated).It would be fine for simply monitoring a baby room, although the camera would have to be placed carefully.

I left mine on and in the charging cradle all night long. Then I used it for about an hour or two off the charger downstairs until my daughter woke up. No problems there. I returned it to the cradle upstairs when she woke up to let it charge for her nap. By naptime, the handheld says it's fully charged, but it dies midway through her nap (it lasts about 2 1/2 hours). So then I had to go upstairs, unplug the charger, plug it in downstairs and let it charge until she woke up. Then I had to lug the whole setup upstairs when I went to bed.

If I hear my baby making noise I turn on the Lorex monitor and see what she is up to. I want to see if she is really crying or just crying because she does not want to sleep (i.e. rubbing her eyes, rolling around). This is great because before I would always go in her room and check things out and disturb her, now I can hold off a little longer to see if she is able to get herself to sleep without my intervention. Most times she can. I have the confidence to let her cry a bit longer because of this product, and her sleeping is now greatly improved.I like the fact you can connect it to your TV. Don't expect HD video though as it has poor resolution but looks okay from across the room at TV viewing distance.  My unit did not come with the cradle so I called Lorex to let them know I was missing it from the box and they sent me one no questions asked (I just had to fax over the receipt). It took about 2 weeks to arrive. You can connect the monitor directly to the TV with the provided AV cable or via the charging cradle.I also use this camera as a low tech webcam by connecting it to my TV, pointing my macbooks built in webcamera at the actual TV screen and streaming the video (of the TV screen) over the internet using EVOCAM (even easier to use USTREAM.TV).This unit has a night camera that also works great and gives a pretty good image in zero light situations.The camera can run on batteries but if the camera is in night mode, the batteries will quickly go dead.

But I quickly got used to it. There is about a 1.5 second delay between when the baby makes a sound and when you hear it on the monitor.We've had this for about 1 month now.

Anyone who purchases this will be pleased. After searching everywhere for a baby monitor I stumbled on this one and was worried because I couldn't see it in the store to play with it first. It also didn't have many reviews here which worried me a little. Other baby monitors had subpar reviews and people talked a lot about the issues with noise from cordless phones, wireless networks, range issues, image quality. Well I took a chance, ordered the system, received it fast, and use it every day.The camera is nice and easy to align. You can use either battery or ac power. The image quality at night is very bright and during the day is acceptable too. Focusing has never been an issue. You can see in completely dark conditions. The night light is nice and remotely enabled/disabled from the handheld. The handheld is very easy to use and handy to carry around the house. It is so simple to use and not overly complex. The screen clarity and size is fine and the menu is basic. The button placement is convenient on the sides but when holding it we tend to press them when we didn't want to. The signal range is very good and goes from back bedroom to mailbox. In Florida, with cement block anyone knows this is a challenge with any wireless device. It works in perfect harmony with my wireless 2.4g router and 2.4g cordless phone.My only cons would be button placement on handheld, pricey for add-on cameras (for like 50 more bucks you can get another handheld), battery life is shorter than I would like. (less than 6 hours with screen saver set at 1 minute)The price is right too. Compare this to any monitor out there and you will be extremely pleased. Price vs. value this unit wins!

The video quality is great.2.) Range is enough to reach from our basement to 2nd story with no issues3.) Night vision is awesome. This is 10X better than our old monitor4.) Support for extra cameras is awesome and a snap to set up5.) Ability to display on a TV is handy. Great for observing the playroom while the adults talk upstairs. We can all see what our kids are up to!6.) Design, the unit is well designed and has a nice belt clip and snap out stand.7.) Love that it is secure and can not be monitored by othersCon -1.) Volume - Now I understand what other reviewers are saying. If you imagine the volume setting on a 1-10 scale, this unit has settings for 5, 7 and 10. There is no setting for 1-5. So on it's lowest level it is way too loud.2.) Battery life - I assumed the 2-4 hour life was when you had the video displayed. This is even true when you just have it monitoring. This is not long enough.3.) Customer Service. I have sent several messages asking to purchase an additional charging stand and have not been contacted. I hate to think how they would treat me if I had a problem.4.) (Updated) After a few months of use the pins in the charging cradle bent, making it hard to get a good charge. We have stopped using the cradle and plug the cord directly in to the unit and it works fine.Having had the unit for a few weeks I can say I would buy it again.

Now he's 1 year old and at this very moment he doesn't seem to want to take his nap so he gets winey. And I like the moniter because I can turn the volume down so I don't have to hear that either. He can get pretty loud. I forget to turn the camera off and its pretty much been on for months with no problems of heating up or bad visual.

Overall, I'd say we're satisfied - can't imagine living without a good night vision camera in the baby's room.  We bought this over competing models (including one with a remotely moveable camera) specifically because it said i wouldn't interfere with Wifi, which it doesn't.  It occasionally (a little too frequently) gets a \"no signal\" which is not related to the strength of the signal.  This problem is solved by turning the unit off and back on.Which brings me to the dumbest design feature: when you power on the handset, the nightlight on the camera automatically turns on for a few seconds.  Who thought that it would be a good idea to illuminate the baby's room when you turn on the handheld?  If we forget to turn on the handheld before bed, we must wait until we're sure the baby is deeply asleep before turning it on.  For the most part, we never turn it off.Since we leave it on all the time, it must be kept on the cradle.  It doesn't have the most confidence inspiring fit on the cradle, and I keep expecting that the contact points are going to bend or something, but they haven't yet.Other than that, the picture is good, the night vision is good, the \"red ring\" around the camera is really subtle and not troublesome (though it's freaky when the kid stares at it while you're looking at the monitor), the alarm settings are about perfect.

I'm not sure about the technical part but this monitor is made by a security company and they scramble  the signal so that no one can pick it up, ensuring the safety of your baby. My only complaint is that the battery doesn't last very long, so we keep it sitting in the cradle most of the time.

This is not a problem if it kicks in reliably - but it DOESN'T.  We have heard our babies crying through the wall and the monitor is silent for ages, until it finally wakes up.- Camera angle of view is very narrow.  I had to build a pole to put it on so that I could see the whole crib from above.  Now the twins are in separate cribs, the camera is across the room in the opposite ceiling corner.  Nowhere left to go when they start getting out of their beds.- the night vision uses a circle of red LEDS (infrared?) to illuminate the room for its night vision - they're pretty unobtrusive, but there's a back lit button on top that's really bright and won't turn off (see light switch comment above).Overall, the technology exists to make this an awesome product.  However, they seem to have taken shortcuts to cut production costs that greatly compromise this.If you're looking for looking to pair this with a DECT monitor that has reliable sound and use this to visually make sure your baby isn't in trouble, it's fine, if a bit expensive.

It hooks up so easily, works well for naps!BUT come night time, the sound is not audible. Great if there is nothing going on, but we need to know when our son is moving and awake, we don't just want to be alerted when he is crying. The reason we bought this is that he recently had a seizure and we want to be alerted to movement (audibly) and then be able to look at the screen to see what is going on. With this, if he tosses and turns you can NOT hear it. He listens to a soothing CD on a very low volume for naps and the camera is mounted on the player and you do not hear the CD at all either. So it really does not pick up sound good.Like other reviewers have said, if you could control this feature, it would be a great monitoring system and worth 5 stars, but with the sound the way it is (or isn't) you are not going to know when your child is awake or moving, unless they make a loud sound to alert you and you could probably hear that without the monitor.

We bought this the end of January and very happy with it.  It is used on a daily basis and works everywhere in the house and around the outside of the house.  Have not found any dead spots.  The camera is on the 2nd floor and can take the monitor to the basement at the opposite end without a problem.Camera quality is excellent in both bright light and total darkness.  Most impressive is the night vision portion.  I have seen reviews with complaints about the quality, I guess that they are expecting High-Def in a system, which it is not.  When used as a baby monitor you can see everything clearly and know what is happening.  One review mentioned that you cannot turn off the picture and it is bright in your room, use the scan feature and it is not a problem.  The monitor will turn off until audio is detected and it will then turn it on.Sound quality is good.  You can clearly understand what is being said or what is happening.  The audio has an auto-mute feature that many reviews will show as a negative.  At first we were concerned about this coming from an analog audio only where you could hear everything.  This has not been a problem after using it and understanding how it works.  This feature is used to turn-on the monitor in the scan mode when something is detected.  Although it would be nice to have the ability to disable the auto-mute, it works well.  In this manner it works great.  Others have mentioned that you cannot mute the sound, you can if you turn it all the way down.Charging station is great.  This was one of the main deciding factors in buying this system over others.  You simply \"dock\" the monitor in the stand to charge it.  It can be used while in the stand without a problem.Battery life is pretty good.  It is recommended when not docked or charging, use the scan mode and the battery will last longer.  We will set it on the counter or table in this mode and when the baby wakes up we will know.Overall this is an excellent product and I'm actually looking to add additional cameras to it.

I use this when the little ones are downstairs playing and I am upstairs doing something else.  My neices are to young to be left alone outside, but I did check to see the viewing range and it was just perfect.  Focused right on the area of the swings with enough parimeter to see them run around a bit.  The color is fine, picture is fine, but again...the sound quality for me is outstanding.  I may add more to this...just for convenience.

I purchase 5 and returned 4. Last but not least I found the Lorex system. Not only did it hold up to distance across my house but there was no interference. I also was concerned with my Summer Infant when my neighbors could see my baby and I could see theirs. With Lorex we have not had that problem at all.Bottom line. Best system ever. Allows me to finally get sleep. As for the other reviews which are concerned with not being able to hear their child 24/7 it actually is fine as the sound comes on in a split second and when the sound is super loud it beeps to alert you.Buy this one for sure.", "Date": "July 5, 2009"}, {"Title": "Good product", "Author": "M.

I received it last night and immediately hooked it up. It worked for a few hours, and then at 4 in the morning my wife noticed the receiver was showing no signal. We went to investigate and found the Camera's power button and light flashing. I unpluged it and plugged in the ac adaptor for the monitor and it worked fine. It was getting a full charge. This is really inconvenient for use in the Nursery.Upon further research I found other technicians saying that the soldering job on the AC adapter on the board was really poor quality and gave reason to why there were several faults.

I really like this one, but now have 2 children to monitor.  The Lorex interfers the signal of my Sharper Image, so I can not use them both as I had hoped to.  I do not believe that I will be able to use any other system (this is my 3rd try) so I'll likely be buying the second camera for the Lorex.My phones are dect 6.0.For the same distance, my Sharper Image monitor is more real time where the Lorex sometimes shows frame by frame movement even within a 10 foot range.  I have not tested the range limit yet.The monitor screen on the Lorex is very good.  Its large screen is a bonus and I really like the rechargeable base station.  Don't expect vibrant colors like your TV.  I haven't seen this out of any system that I've tried yet.The negative is as other's have mentioned, I would prefer to have constant sound.  My 2 year old often plays quietly on the floor of her room where she is not within the monitor's view.  I can't tell if she's napping under the covers or playing quietly on the floor unless she starts singing or I open the door and blow my 'free' time..which isn't going to happen!Overall, I believe this to be the best camera on the market.

Schacher \"Practical Mom\"", "ReviewID": "R1PX3N80YZWPWH", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "When first searching for the perfect video monitor for our children's bedrooms and our playroom I made sure to research EVERY possible \"baby monitor\" out there. My husband suggested looking into security camera's and I sort of chringed at the idea. HOWEVER, I wish that I would have researched that idea. With all the technology that is out there today. I would have definintely purchased something that I could view on my mobile phone. Now, on to the actual Lorex monitor.%1: I dealt with customer service only once by email and was VERY dissapointed. I sent them the issue that I had just to get some feedback and without questioning when I purchased or the model number of my monitor they replied with \"your item is out of warranty\". I then sent back to them the model and date of purchase and they told me that I would have to send back the original base (I'll explain the problem in a minute) and wait for them to send me a new one. Anyone that has a monitor of any kind with kids knows that it is pretty nessecariy with children (esspecially if you want to go outside while a little one is taking a nap) and it would be a HUGE inconvinience to send back a peice that I need in order for the system to function.#2: The monitor itself doesn't deal with normal wear and tear very well. I have had my iphone for almost 3 years. I take it with me everywhere, my children play with it, and I have dropped it numerous times. It still works like a champ. This monitor has been upstairs and downstairs in our home, dropped only a few times mostly on carpet (I feel like that is \"normal wear and tear\") and is not doing good. I feel like it is only a matter of one more accidental drop before it quits working. So, needless to say, it isn't very sturdy for the normal wear and tear of \"mom-life\".#3: The charging base has prongs that have to be matched up with the bottom of the monitor. These prongs easily get bend down (just by putting the monitor on the base) and cause the monitor not to charge. So, you could go throughout the night and if it is bumped even a little bit, the monitor will stop charging and die without you even knowing it. Seems like it was made pretty cheap.#4: Doesn't pick up the cameras at random times (not even when I am \"out of range\"). It sometimes doesn't pick up the camera that is a room over from our bedroom. Strange. Speaking of range...it's not that great!Way overpriced for what you get.
