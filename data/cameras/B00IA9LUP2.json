Back in the mid-2000's when the Digital Rebel was kicking up it's heels it seems Nikon had no clue on how to compete in the lower end of the digital market.  Nikon has had some relative hits in the compact market especially the P510.I had a few Panansonic FZ cameras but abandoned them when the UI was getting long in the tooth and Panasonic was distracted.  I've since moved onto M 4/3 cameras and am generally happy.  Except when I need some lens reach.I'm shopping around again for a longer lens small camera.  The P510 had alot going for it.  The P510 was the breakthrough camera.  The P520 was more treading water and has some issues that make the P520 a misstep (battery life, focus hunting for most of the long range, etc.) The P530 added a flip out screen, more HDR options.  Sensor resolution went back under 16mp which is a good thing (the MP wars are silly, see below). But if you check on shapshort, the P530 scores much lower than P520.  In short, Nikon is treading water here and, in light of everything else in the industry, is loosing ground overall. The P530 feels like they have run out of ideas.  Yes there is a resculpting on the body, it seems more aerodynamic and cooler.  The video is passable but seems a little jittery/unpolished. There is some focus hunting going on in both stills and video at the long range which is not uncommon among superzooms.  Images overall also seem a bit flat/compressed, more so than with P510/P520.If you are already in the P510/P520 line, there is little reason to upgrade here.  In fact there is little reason for most camera sites to do a full review on this camera.  It's just this years model of mostly the same, not much innovation.  It's the P600 where Nikon took a few new chances and some [minor] innovation, but even with better manual focus, the P600 is also hobbled by a fairy-house viewfinder (read below).  A bridge camera without a composable/usable viewfinder is kinda just an oversized P&S; with some options.I've been doing a lot of research and putting hands on these cameras before purchase.  The IQ of the P510/P520/P530 is really good for the compact segment.  The body design overall is nice.  The menu system is adequate.  However, personally, I really like the experience of a viewfinder.  A viewfinder really can put you into the scene and really concentrate on composition.  It is quite important.The problem is that the viewfinder on the P510/P520/P530 is tiny.  I could not believe how small it was.  I felt like I was looking through the window of a very small fairy house.  It is not a usable viewfinder.  In fact it's almost like not having a viewfinder at all.  Note to camera makers:  *** 201,000 dot EVF is a joke *** .If you are looking for a travel zoom, it's a hard sell to go to a P530/P600 when something like the Panasonic LUMIX DMC-ZS15 12.1 MP High Sensitivity MOS Digital Camera with 16x Optical Zoom (Black) or Canon PowerShot SX280 12MP Digital Camera with 20x Optical Image Stabilized Zoom with 3-Inch LCD (Black) offer so much.I don't know if Canon and Nikon and the rest realized this.  But the market is ripe for a small camera with a good sized viewfinder for $300 price point.  The Canon SX500/510 is a terrific sized small camera.  If you put a solid EVF on that kind of platform sales would go through the roof.  Stop playing the megapixel wars (this is happening now with settling back to 12-16 MP), stop the hyper zoom wars (50x is just silly), settle on quality, not just specs, and put a blessed viewfinder that is really good (1,440,000-dot) on a small body of decent zoom (max 24x to 30x) and watch a stellar hit in the making.If you are a birder or looking to shoot sports then either the Canon HX50 or Fuji HS50 are stronger contenders here overall, probably currently best of the bunch. With the HX50 being ~$100 below the P530 just now, the P530 is a really tough sell. But keep in mind the Canon has the same tiny EVF as the P5300.  (If you don't need a viewfinder then Panasonic or Canon are among the best choices in small travel zoom.)In closing I decided to get a Fujifilm FinePix HS50EXR 16MP Digital Camera with 3-Inch LCD (Black) to quench my long lens urges.Update:  If you can live with 7.1x zoom, then this Nikon is a very good buy Nikon COOLPIX P7800 12.2 MP Digital Camera with 7.1x Optical Zoom NIKKOR ED Glass Lens and 3-inch Vari-Angle LCD.  It has a 921K EVF that you can actually see through.
