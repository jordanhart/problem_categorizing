This cam in in my top 3 online perchases and the other 2 were were auctions so this was probably the best perchase I have ever made. This cam was on sale for between $25 and $30. I figured at that price even if it wasnt to great I could give it to my grand daughter. I still have it. I like it very much. The one click between video and still is very easy and quick to use. The photos at 14mp are very good. It has a lot of other features that make it a very good value. Cameras like this are always well over $100, I wish I would have bought more. I can't even find this model on line any more so if you do see one at a good price buy it its a very good point and shoot cam.", "Date": "November 17, 2011"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": "Unavailable", "Features": "14.0 megapixel resolution\n2.7\" bright color LCD for previewing images before you shoot\nSD/SDHC Compatible for expanded memory\nAnti-shake image stabilization\nFace tracking for perfect faces in your pictures", "Name": "Polaroid CTA-1455B 14 Megapixel Digital Camera (Black)", "ImgURL": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41eZJu1RdmL._SX300_.jpg", "ProductID": "B0043UKQE8"}}
