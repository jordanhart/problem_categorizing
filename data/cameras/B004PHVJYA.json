I didn't like the quality of the photos of the Nikon & the battery died after one day so I returned it & got this on Amazon. LOOOOOOOOVE IT!!!!!!!!I am amazed at the amount of accessories that comes with this package-if you bought them at a store individually, the whole package would be at least 2 times the cost as it is here.This is an AWESOME deal. Also, the quality of the pictures is much better w/this camera. The up-close detail you can get with this camera (even w/o the zoom lens) is unbelievable. The colors are beautiful,  it's easy to use. I LOVE IT! . I cant say enough good things about it. Would definitely reccomend it.", "Date": "August 11, 2013"}, {"Title": "Cool stuff", "Author": "CcGG", "ReviewID": "R1UOX2JO1746LC", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I love the camera and it shipped really fast the lenses are fantastic and it smells nice.
