This camera is simply awesome. It has all the things anyone would want in a  camera: Optical Zoom, Small Compact Size, Great quality pictures & movies with sound, lots of modes & easily customizable, ease of menu and fast pictures.Olympus has decreased the size (compared to C-750 which has same features) mainly by changing from standard 4 AA batteries to small Li battery. They have removed the hot-shoe , which usually slips & fall down. Turbo PicPro helps to take real fast pictures like in football game. (That was my first photo session with this new camera). I have compared my results with other comparable cameras and found this one better than others.Sometimes there could be some problem of focussing at higher zoom, but it can be dealt easily by waiting for a few seconds once you increase the zoom before taking picture. It gives the time for enough light to enter. For better pictures, its aperture and shutter speed can be adjusted as well. Night mode picture quality is good and panoramic quality is really great. For self-timer photos, it gives you about 12 seconds before taking the picture.Overall, I will recommend this to everyone, be it a beginner in digital photography or an enthusiastic like me.Updated: June 14, 2005I have been using it now for about 8 months and have used it in almost all the different geographic locations and at different times e.g. Blizzard in boston, desert and stony terrain, tennis courts at late evenings, football game, capture stage-shows, fireworks, babes at beaches, breakdancing events. I observed that this camera can be customized for almost any condition and it gives the best results. recently someoen asked me to suggest a camera cheaper than this and with approximately same quality in pictures. Frankly, I couldn't find one.Update: July 5, 2006This camera is doing really very impressive job. Apart from doing travel photography for landscapes and cityscapes, I have used for sports events like football games, horseraces and catching fireworks. Results are really impressive. These days, most cameras are in 5-6 MP range and create bulky files, more than 1 MB each. This camera is 4 MP and the file size is 600-800 kb with quality still very good.", "Date": "November 30, 2004"}, {"Title": "The C-755: same camera, same features, GREAT CAMERA", "Author": "Jennifer StAntoine \"ladyjadegd\"", "ReviewID": "R1934CJKWXFWE9", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "We recently purchased the C-755, which is essentially the same camera as the 765, it just came from a different store, thus a different model number.  Costco.com had a great deal and we decided to go for it and replace our old digital cameras with this one.  I haven't had a chance to learn EVERYTHING as there are many many features available, but it has been wonderful so far.  When using the auto feature, it takes beautiful pictures and the quality is top notch.There are two things, both related to the flash, that caused me to rate it a 4 rather than a 5 (and I'd go 4.5, if I had the choice available to me).  First, if you don't remember to put the flash up manually, there is no flash.  Of course this is a good thing when you don't want the flash accidentally going off like in a museum!  The second thing is that when you use the auto function you cannot force the flash ON manually.  When it says AUTO, it means AUTO.  There are so many features like the ability to program personal settings to be accessed later and the ability to use it for short video that are awesome and the zoom is amazing for a camera at this price.I highly recommend this camera!ADDENDUM:  This camera requires the X-D memory chips which is newer technology, thus a little pricey.  We were disappointed that the chips for our old Olympus digital would not work.  We purchased a new chip at Costco for around $70 and it holds over 200 pictures.  Sorry I forgot to mention this initially.  It's still a great camera and the chips are likely to come down in cost as time passes.In addition, I had no difficulties loading the software into my Sony Vaio Computer.  It was quick and painless and all I have to do is plug the cord from the camera into my USB port and the software starts right up.  It asks me what I want to do and I can quickly download my pictures.", "Date": "August 19, 2004"}, {"Title": "Great first camera", "Author": "JMH \"jarredh83\"", "ReviewID": "R25WNFBY3JKS5Q", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Other than a cheap point and shoot camera, this is the first real camera that I have owned. I decided to go with a digital camera that way I would practice my photography skills without wasting a whole lot of money on film. Overall, I have been very impressed with this camera. I recently got back from a trip to London and everyone was very impressed with the pictures that I got. For the beginner, you can set the camera on Auto Mode on and get great shots. For the more advanced photographer, the camera offers enough creative control over things such as aperature and shutter speed. I experimented with the camera in the Sport Mode and was able to freeze an acrobat in the middle of a flip. This camera is not for a professional, but for the beginner to an intermediately advanced photographer, it makes a great camera. My only real complaint with the camera is shooting pictures at night or extremely low light situations is somewhat difficult. I recommend using a tripod or some other way to stabilize it for best results. It is possible that there is something that I haven't figured out yet since I feel like I am still learning a lot about this camera. Other than this though, I highly recommend this camera to anyone looking for a solid, reliable camera that takes excellent photos.", "Date": "June 1, 2004"}, {"Title": "Excellent camera!!  zoom rocks!!", "Author": "Joe Brawn", "ReviewID": "R3QEGPJR5QEIVI", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I feel so happy taking pictures with this camera. The 10X optical zoom is critical for the stile of pictures that I like to take: portrait, detailed pictures, lots of deep. Pictures are so good that it reminds me my old SRL film camera that had an 80-380mm zoom. Colors are vivid, details are excellent, supports 512MB media.Flash is OK but I was expecting more of it, the C-770 has better flash.Don't install the software. If you are using Windows XP you won't need the software. It is good for nothing, shame on Olympus!!!. If you don't want to spend more money download one from Internet, ie: free Adobe photoshop album.If you want to have the best pictures, you will need editing software that works well like Photoshop Elements 3 that is the one that I recently bough.My final advice: what ever camera you buy, learn to use it well, study the manual, practice taking lots of pictures.

There are a bunch of professional review websites up(dcresource.com), so if you want to know all about this camera, then go there.  As far as an amateur/for fun review, then I have to give it 4 stars.  I would give it 5 but I must say that in low light situations, it's sometimes hard to get the camera to focus.  But, the overall ease of use and picture quality of this camera is great.  The only other camera I even thought of getting was the Cannon S1, but didn't like the 3 megapixels and the fact that the camera would not focus correctly at max zoom....(verified this fact by playing with one at my local camera store...If cannon would only fix this little problem...then I will get the next generation of this superb camera).  Great little introductory camera for those of us with little knowledge of picture taking.", "Date": "August 19, 2004"}, {"Title": "Great close ups, action and zoom", "Author": "Chacodog.com \"chacodog.com\"", "ReviewID": "R9GY88HB3TM14", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I shoot thousands of close up pictures per year of American Indian jewelry for my website (most at a distance of 8\" to 24\"). See Chacodog.com for real examples of close up photos from this camera. I'd been using an Olympus C3020 for the last three years and liked it very much, both for ease of use and the true color it produced. All such shots are taken outdoors and everything is taken on auto settings in macro mode. It was time to  step up and I was favorably disposed to Olympus cameras (I have a Canon SD10 ELPH and, while it's okay, it's not as easy to use the menus as on an Olympus and it seems to yield colors that are a little more vivid than what you shoot). I chose this camera because there was no point going beyond 4 megapixels for web photos (most people reduce their photos in size to send them via e-mail, etc. and throw out half or more of the pixels, so anything beyond 4 megapixels is for the thin air crowd, i.e., pros). Cutting to the chase: I was stunned by shots I got effortlessly with this camera. Particularly, it was easier to shoot in several different light conditions with it and the C765 would adjust automatically for conditions and create a great shot whereas my old C3020 could produce a great shot on auto but the light had to be within much narrower perameters for success. This camera also has super macro, which I needed because I sometimes shoot objects that are too small for the C3020 to focus on properly at 8\" and beyond (which is the closest it will work). The C765 will get you to within 1 1/2\" on super macro. Okay, granted, this is very specialized as a need, but someone out there needs this for the same reason--shooting close ups for eBay, for example, if you're running in eBay's hamster wheel, on their treadmill, working in their salt mine. I found that this camera produced much less noise than the C3020 and I still prefer Olympus colors to those produced by my Canon ELPH. I may shoot thousands of photos per year, but it's wash and wear photography. It has to be true for color, but I don't have time to do much more than crop, re-size and re-name photos. I can't take hours touching up photos (which wouldn't necessarily yield a true photo, just a pretty one). I need a camera that does most of the work automatically and permits me to shoot up to 200 photos in a session with a high rate of success and produces honest shots which don't need tweaking. This has a vastly improved speed on focusing and just knocks out the photo right. I make a living with this camera and it carries its weight and more. My only regret? That I spent too long shooting with the C3020 before upgrading. I just figured that any problems with my pictures were my fault and eventually I got to where I had a 90+% rate of success with the C3020. Who cares if it was my fault--moron or not, I can shoot great pictures faster, more consistently and effortlessly with this machine.I was also intrigued by the zoom power on this camera and hoped that getting all these features wouldn't bugger the most important one for me--close ups. Anyway, I've used the zoom at outdoor track meets and gotten great, clear shots from 50 or 60 feet. And I've used the high-speed sports setting coupled with sequential shooting at track meets to get crystal clear shots of track events with runners at full speed (100 meters finish, coverage of all eight lanes in the curve on the 4 x 100).Had I paid a little more attention when buying this, I would have bought the C770 to get the MPEG video and the remote control (though I might never use either one). I find the battery life on a charge is wholly acceptable and I always have a spare battery charged. Likewise, I prefer having two xD cards of 256--it's plenty of pictures to shoot without uploading to the computer and a larger card just isn't necessary for me. Great deal on the 256's, so no sense in buying 128's. In short, buy an extra battery and two cards (the one they give you has zero capacity, it's just so they can say they gave you a card with the camera). I bought the bullet proof case for ten bucks or so and it will fit the camera and extra cards and batteries and is good enough while keeping the size small.I don't see how you could go wrong with this camera.", "Date": "May 19, 2005"}, {"Title": "A great buy", "Author": "Tim", "ReviewID": "R2SYY9D60I6Y8J", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I really like this camera.  The biggest bonus to the camera is how adaptable it is. If you are a novice, it can be used as a simple point-and-shoot camera, and it has several scene selections (portrait, landscape, sport, night, etc.).  If you are a more advanced user, this camera is great too.  It has several levels of customizability:  choose one function and allow the camera to determine the rest, or you can select ALL the settings yourself.The camera has threads on the lens, so it is essentially upgradeable, with more advanced telephoto (not that you need it with a 10X optical zoom built in), macro and other lens attachments available through Olympus.  Or you could attach filters.  It is as close as you can get to an SLR without paying an arm and a leg.The C-765UZ has an electronic viewfinder.  Many people don't like EVFs, but I love it.  I have some visual difficulties, and sometimes can't really see through an optical viewfinder.  The EVF is very bright and clear.  It is even manageable in low light settings.  It was the brightest EVF of any camera in its class that I tested.Many people may say that the C-765UZ is a little pricey compared to other 10X zoom cameras.  However, those other brands are usually 3MP instead of the 4MP of the C-765UZ.  In addition, the optics on the Olympus C-Series is generally superior to those other camera.  Remember you get what you pay for!!  Plus the C-765 is the SMALLEST 10X optical zoom camera on the market today (Spring 2005).The only complaints I have are with the packaged accessories.  Olympus only provides a 16MB xD card, so you need to add a 256MB card to your initial purchase.  Also, Olympus provides the Li-10B rechargeable battery, but the \"replacement\" 12B battery has a higher capacity.  It would have been nice to get the better battery in the initial bundle.  Oh, and speaking of batteries, the C-765UZ ONLY takes the rechargeable Li-10B/12B batteries, so if your battery is running low you can't just throw in a few AA's to get by until another charge.  It keeps the size and weight down, but trades convenience.", "Date": "April 1, 2005"}, {"Title": "Wow! What a camera and what a LOW price!", "Author": "J.

This is the best camera I've ever owned!  It'll take me 6 months to figure out all the things it does do!One GREAT thing about this camera...it is NOT HP!  I had an HP digital and then bought and HP 3 in 1 printer thinking they'd compliment each other.  WRONG!  HP makes nice hardware but they have the BUGGIEST software going!  The camera's software actually conflicted with the Printer's software and both were HP!Now, no worries and no ugly \"dock\" to stick it in (that only works about half the time too).  This camera just plugs directly into the computer and download away with NO conflicts!  The Camedia software is nice, if rudimentry.  I would advise a Print Shop Pro type program to REALLY work with your pictures, particularly if you do any web hosting/posting.I took a picture of our black german shepherd at dusk, sitting in a shadow covered corner of the house and did NOT use the flash, just to see what would come out (the HP camera would have rendered a black screen).  With no flash I got a GREAT picture of our dog without that possessed look that you get when your dog looks directly into the flash.  Just amazing pictures.  I took another one of the flowering bush outside out house THROUGH the window and there is no way you could tell!  My daughter commented that the picture was nice enough to put on a calendar. And she's right.For less than $300 this camera takes fantastic pictures.  Of course you have to have an eye for your photo taking too.  I have a friend who bought a $1200 camera and his pictures stink because he thought a more expensive camera would make him a better photographer....WRONG!!! hahahahaha!!You can macro set this camera (ultra close ups) or shoot sports or shoot in just about no light at all.

Although you certainly don't need to read it to be able to use the camera as it's very easy to operate.  I was advised to get at least 3MP for good end results when printing the photos and the 10x optical zoom cannot be beat.  This camera produces extremely clear photos that can be enlarged to 8x10 without loosing clarity.  My belief is that it's not worth spending $150-200 on a digital camera if you end up with grainy photos - just keep your regular camera until you're ready to make an investment for the higher grade camera and if you are ready, I highly recommend this camera.

The macro and super macros are awesome.  The pic quality is absolutely incredible.  The battery life is good, using the flash it's going to putter out sooner so I recommend getting a spare.  Recharge on the battery is quick too.  You will need a 256 card right away.  I was worried about the electronic viewfinder, but it's not posed a problem at all.  Most of the 10X zooms, at least all that I reviewed, have EVF's.  I've only had a few problems focusing indoors.  Like all digital cameras there's a minor lag and if your toddler moves as you're taking the pic, you'll get a blurry shot.  This is such a minor problem considering how many great shots I have gotten in and outdoors.  I've had this camera for 6 months now and just love it.  I was able to use it right out of the box.

It's totally worth its price. It's not great for candid shots due to some lag time, but otherwise it captures beautiful pictures. I didn't think that we really needed the 10X zoom until we went to a graduation ceremony and was able to take great shots despite the distance from the podium. We found that the pictures are less blurry when you rely on the viewfinder rather than the monitor. (I would also recommend saving all of your pictures until you load them on the computer, as the actual detail/quality is not entirely evident when viewed on the camera monitor.) The video quality isn't great, but proved to be a bonus benefit when traveling and catching unique performances.In terms of cons: as mentioned earlier, some lag time compared to a traditional point-and-click; incorrect settings (as the dial is easily turned when taken out of the camera bag - but that's probably just our problem); and short battery life (especially when you use the LCD monitor). I bought an extra battery via Amazon (one of the cheapo kinds) which worked out really well. Also, when you get a larger memory card, make sure to get SanDisk/Olympus instead of Fuji, as the latter does not support the panaromic setting.Finally, as mentioned in a previous review, it is best to print out the manual (double paged) from the CD.Good luck!", "Date": "March 20, 2005"}, {"Title": "The perfect camera for all users", "Author": "D.

I am already noticing several flaws compared to the other, cheaper camera:* It is far more difficult to use -- you have to change the settings manually each time you wish to use the additional digital zoom. A number of other settings, including the macro modes, require time-consuming manual changes. This is in stark contrast to the automatic style of the Pentax, with several modes to choose from on the wheel atop the camera. The zoom is also set up awkwardly, so that you can't do it with your finger still on the take button.* I notice already that the picture quality is much worse, despite the mere 1MP difference. All of my photos come out with red-eye, no matter how I set the flash and camera.* Shutter speed is extremely slow, as is on/off.* Focus is terrible. The first couple of days I got this camera, I was excited to go out and experiment with different modes -- night mode, macro mode, portrait mode, action mode. Even while steadying my hand and taking care not to move at all, the photos always turned out blurry. The ONLY usable mode left on the camera is \"auto,\" and even then the photos are often blurry.I admit that I am no expert with cameras. However, in comparing this (more expensive) camera to my little Pentax, I find that the additional zoom is hardly useful. I don't even want the camera anymore, but I purchased it through a non-Amazon retailer (still at amazon.com) and the return process is proving more complicated than it would be had I paid the extra $20 to get it straight from  Amazon.I hope that reading the above issues with this camera will help you make your decision. I would strongly suggest buying directly from amazon.com in any case -- from what I understand, their return and service policy is worth it, no matter which camera you choose.", "Date": "September 10, 2005"}, {"Title": "C765 Digital Camera", "Author": "Elwood C.

The pre-set macro mode is great fun--it allows you take some gorgeous extreme close-ups. You do need to keep your hands extremely steady or use a tripod to prevent the picture from being too blurry (using the action shot mode also helps, since the shutter speed is faster). I bought mine for $339, and it's a really good value for the money. The only minor complaint I have is that the propietary XD card is pretty expensive and you need to get the Olympus brand if you want to take panoramic pictures, but I managed to find a 256MB chip for $40, so really I don't have too much to complain about.

I love the 10 optical zoom and even took a few not too bad 40x digital zoom( alittle grainy though)of birds outside my dining room window.  However, like life it does have it's little quirks. It is not the greatest camera for low light indoor pictures ie.in a restaurant. The camera needs a tripod for low light focusing. Also, Olympus really should include a better paperback manual instead of having it on a CD. I actually went to my office & downloaded the CD to paper and understand now why Olympus put the info onto a CD! I now have a 124 page BINDER!  It took me a little while to get use to the tiny XD card & the lithium ion battery. Use to it now, no big deal! I had no problems when I went to Italy,using an adaptor convertor,some people on our trip did though with other camera models. I bought my adaptor at Radio Shack. To download pictures easily to my lap top I use a DAZZLE digital media adaptor. Works like a charm!! When traveling at least a 256 memory card is needed and an extra battery.

Although some reviewers said that this camera is bulky in comparison to other popular digital cameras, I find it more compact than my old camera and does not look silly even if you bring it to a party & etc. However, due to its  protuded lens part, it won't fit into a small camera case so choose a medium camera case if you are looking for one. The camera is pretty fast (except for the night mode) and gives a clear photo. Tripod is a must for a dark room since a hand vibration could cause blurred photo like most digital cameras. It doesn't bring out big red spots like my old camera in the dark room, but taking photo with a night mode is slow. Taking video with this camera is pretty good in a lit area. The instruction booklet is hard to use (reduction of details in favor of having millions of translations) and playing with a camera might be a better learning technique.

I sent it back to Olympus to be repaired. The camera was returned today and the only comment that the Olympus guys have, is that \"the play in the lens is normal\". And to my great agitation, now the lens mount shakes even in the closed position, ie. when it is mostly embedded in the body.  So now I am stuck with a camera that I am almost afraid to use, because its lens feels like it could disassemble from the body any moment.

This is my first \"quality\" digital camera and I am very happy with it so far.  After ordering it, I received the camera within four days and have been snapping at least 10-30 pictures a day for the past week to familiarize myself with the many different settings that it provides.Before committing to this camera, I did quite a bit of research online;  reading reviews and deciding on what type of camera would best fit my current and future needs.  I am a novice photo snapper, and after buying this camera I must say that I can see myself getting into photography as a hobby.  This camera offers a wide range of manual settings.  It has a full manual mode that allows you to control the aperture, shutter speed, and ISO setting (64-400) along with manual focusing, for when the camera just can't seem to get a good lock on what you want it to.  The 10x optical zoom was one of the selling points for me, as using digital zoom degrades your final photo quite a bit.  It does have a digital zoom option, however I will never use it for that reason (which is one of the \"lies\" of digital camera marketing).  As far as picture resolution goes, the C765 has 5 different quality modes (TIFF, SHQ, HQ, SQ1, SQ2), each of which has it's own resolution modes along with it.  So, for the casual picture of friends and family that you might take, 1280x960 (SQ1, High) would be more than enough to print a quality 4x6 picture for the photo album.  However, personally, I like having the option of using extremely high resolution (TIFF, 2288x1712) for those pictures where you would want more detail and may like to print a larger copy.There are few things that I must recommend when buying this camera.  You absolutely must buy a bigger memory card, as the included 16MB card is just not enough.  This camera has a movie mode as well, and 16MB only gives you a 14 second movie before the card is full.  I bought a 256MB card along with it and, at 1600x1200, you can fit 182 pictures on it (with approx. 13 minutes of video if you want to use it).  Another accessory that I highly recommend is another battery (Li12B).  I have found with my tinkering that the included battery (Li10B) will only last for 1 - 1 1/2 hours of continuous use (with the LCD on).  It sounds like a long enough time but you definately should have at least one extra battery just in case.  Lastly, I highly recommend a tripod.  I have found it quite hard to keep my hands steady enough to take a sharp picture at full zoom... plus using the manual settings you can have the shutter open for up to 15 seconds (for night photos, extremely low light, and creative photos), and it's close to impossible to get a non-blurry picture at that setting.So, to end my rather lengthy review of this camera, I highly recommend this camera to any user who wants complete control over his/her photos.  It is definately a learning experience deciding when to use specific settings, but taking the time to go through the manual (full manual on the software cd) will give you a better understanding of the finer points of digital photography.  I look forward to experimenting with all of the options that are available to me and hope that my review of this camera helps someone else decide upon this excellent camera for the relatively low price.", "Date": "June 28, 2005"}, {"Title": "Great Camera", "Author": null, "ReviewID": "R14CVOXEPGFSKR", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I replace my old Olympus 450 with this camera.

Prior to getting this one, I had been using my Olympus Camedia 3030.  This one has several things that really make it better than the old one:First and foremost, it has the 10x optical zoom.  I often found with the C-3030 that I couldn't get close enough in on people and animals if they were more than about 20 feet away.  This one solves that problem.  Second, the lag time from pressing the button to the shutter releasing is significantly reduced in this camera.  I can actually capture my son before he has left the picture frame.  It still isn't as fast as an SLR, but it is light years ahead of where it used to be.  Third, I have noticed significantly fewer red eye issues with this camera.  This is a big deal for me since everyone in my family is fair skinned with blue eyes.  Last, the battery is a Li rechargeable.  It only takes about two hours to get a full charge.  Picture quality is exceptional.  I haven't had any problems with the zoom lens (but I do try to steady the camera on a fence or something if the zoom is fully extended).All in all, I think this is a great camera.  Admittedly, I don't use all the bell and whistles -- mostly the automatic settings.  Oh, and one other thing I like -- it is easier to control the flash with this one since you have to open it to use it.A Few Cons: It may be overpriced compared to the competition.  The battery and charger come with the camera, but a spare battery costs approx. $50.00 (and you can't use AA's in a pinch).  You'll definitely need to buy a 256MB card right away.
