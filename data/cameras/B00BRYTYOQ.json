Also, there isn't a \"flashing\" light but there is a light so it's not discrete.  I tried it once and you can't hear anything that's more than 2 or 3 feet away from the device.  When I called customer service the connection kept cutting out so I had to send an email.  The company did say that I could return it and that they wouldn't charge me the restocking fee.  I haven't checked my statement yet to see if I received a refund.  Unless you want the device to speak directly into it yourself, I wouldn't recommend it.", "Date": "June 21, 2013"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": "Unavailable", "Features": "Slim, light design and no flashing light while recording for the ultimate in discretion!\nColor Video Format: AVI 640(W) x 480(H) Pixels Video Frame Rate: >= 30 FPS\nPower Supply: USB Port, USB Plug & Play\nOperates up to 2 hours with Li-Ion battery\nBuilt in 16GB Memory.
