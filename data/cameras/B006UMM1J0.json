I took a few shots with it in my dim living room and compared them with both the Canon A620 and the Canon Rebel XTI...all in \"auto\".  The 520 HS took noisier pictures, yet they were much better to view than the others, which were less noisy but much darker.  Which is better, a black frame or a noisy picture?  I switched to Program mode and started playing with the settings and menus.  The first thing I noticed was that JPG compression was set at \"fine\"...not \"very fine\" which is an option. File size went up, but noise decreased quite a bit.  Much of the noise was in fact jpg compression artifacts.The IS seems to work quite well.The zoom is fantastic for a camera of this size.The lens is not \"flat\"...you can achieve quite nice bokeh for a point and shoot.It has user defined white balance, which I believe is one of the most important features to getting good photos.The super slow motion is cool, but kind of a gimmick.  I got some great video of hummingbirds around the feeder, but it is low resolution.There is no printed manual, just a PDF file on the included CD ROM.Flash is unobtrusive, but semi-weak.Overall, I'm quite happy with my purchase.  I think you'll get way better pictures than most point-and-shoots if you switch to the \"Program\" mode.  Your best camera is the one that you actually use to take pictures.  The availability of an inexpensive Ikelite underwater housing and the camera's ability to take HD video mean that the Canon Elph 520 HS is going on vacation with us, while the Canon DSLR is sitting at home.  My Canon A620 took fantastic underwater video and stills, but alas, after many scuba trips and several dozens of hours underwater (and many years) it doesn't like humidity any more.I'd give this 5 stars based on what it is and what it's intended to be used for, but in the end I rated it 4 stars because it is a bit noisy in \"auto\" mode.  I'll update this review after we get back from vacation where I'll really get to test the underwater mode and low light performance of stills and video.Update June 10th -The more I shoot with this camera the more I like it.  It is able to capture fantastic images in natural lighting with true to life colors. The myriad of scene modes makes getting the right shot on the first try very easy.  I really wouldn't call this a point and shoot...the images in auto mode are good, but when you switch into scene mode you can get fantastic images if you select the appropriate scene.  I'm upping my rating to 5 stars.", "Date": "June 8, 2012"}, {"Title": "I love this little camera!", "Author": "Ron", "ReviewID": "R2RTB8AMZXGOYT", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I received the 520HS on Saturday.  I am coming from the Canon SD1000, so I loved the fact that the 520HS is the same size, but 3/4 of an ounce lighter.  You can read about the features on Canon's website.  I really want to comment on the face recognition feature.  I took some photos on my computer to set up the face recognition.  Today, I took pictures of my daughter's three month old twin girls.  I was amazed that the camera recognized their faces.  The camera did not use flash even though we were indoors.  I must say the pictures are truly amazing.  They look like a professional photographer took them.  I have read some negative reviews that claim the camera gives poor low light pictures.  Some reviewers did not even have a micro SD card in the camera.  Well, that is not the case.  The DIGIC 5 processor is exceptional for indoor shooting without a flash.  The reviewers complained that they already had SD cards and did not like the fact that they would have to get a Micro SD card.  I got an 8GB, Class 10, micro SD with the Amazon name for $11.99.  I can't comment on the battery life yet because I have not had to recharge it.  I didn't get the 530HS because I had heard negative feedback about the touch screen.  The only thing other than the touch screen that is different is that the 530HS has wi-fi.  The 520HS cost at least $50 less.  I am leaving on a cruise and will report back when I return.", "Date": "April 2, 2012"}, {"Title": "The Reason For Mixed Reviews -- Revealed!", "Author": "Mel R. Scurbica", "ReviewID": "RAB4QXLFGRDQV", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I ust bought this camera for my wife, who is a technophobe. She loves it. The camera is simple to use on automatic mode...it really does everything for you.Now, why are there some negative reviews for this camera slamming it for image quality?Out of the box, the Canon PowerShot ELPH 520 HS is not configured at its highest-possible resolution. I don't know whether to blame lazy owners who don't take the time to go through the manual, novice owners who just don't understand, or Canon for making a bad decision for not making the default the highest resolution and for including the owner's manual on a CD where most people will never see it.So, here's what you do:Go into the camera's menu. Look for Image Quality and change the resolution from Fine to Super Fine.Now you own a tiny camera that takes great photos that Amazon sells for the same price brand new as Canon sells for a refurb. New, Canon sells this camera for over $130 more than Amazon.People who complain that image quality suffers in low light at high ISOs, I have news for you: Expensive digital cameras that cost $500 and up have the same problem. You could get a Sony DSC-RX100 II for over $700, which does really well in low light, but this camera is aimed at a different user base.Looking at images at 100 percent magnification, I did notice noise. But for most people, this isn't going to be an issue. Keep in mind this is an inexpensive consumer camera, not a professional grade camera, and not a prosumer grade camera. If you are a professional photographer looking to make giant prints, you aren't using this Elph. This is a camera to keep in your pocket or purse, meant to take photos of your friends and family.If you are looking for a little point and shoot camera that takes great photos, is easy enough for just about anyone to use, and that sells at a price that won't break the bank, this is the camera for you.", "Date": "September 21, 2013"}, {"Title": "Simply Amazing", "Author": "Jerry P. Danzig", "ReviewID": "R3JC0I72D3XIQP", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "For some years, I have had a Canon Digital ELPH S100, with which I have been very pleased.But time marches on, and the 2MP resolution of that fine little point and shoot has long been left behind.  As I recall, the camera also offered only three or four times optical zoom, if I'm not mistaken.So when I saw that Canon was offering this ELPH 520 with 10MP and 12X optical zoom -- and Amazon was selling it for less than half the price I paid for the S100 back when -- I couldn't resist.Incredibly, this new model is even more compact -- both thinner and lighter -- than the S100.  As other reviewers have stated, I don't know how Canon gets a 12X zoom into this little body, but they did.  Needless to say, this gives you much more flexibility framing shots from one vantage point.I didn't know if I would miss the optical viewfinder of the old model, but the 520 has a large (3-inch), bright LCD screen, and I just went out and shot some beautifully composed pictures of nearby architectural landmarks here in the Gramercy Park area of Manhattan.  As someone wearing both glasses and a brimmed hat on a cold day, I appreciated being able to compose pictures despite those encumbrances.I have barely begun to delve into the wealth of features this mighty mite of a camera offers, including HD video capture with stereo microphones, plus a long array of shooting modes to handle particular situations and subjects, including fireworks, portraits, low light, under water, snowy backgrounds, and more.The camera also offers some artistic special effects like vivid color, posterized shots, fish-eye lens, monochrome, plus the color accent so popular in advertising photography (one object in color -- the rest of the photo in monochrome).Best of all, you can set the camera to AUTO mode, and it will determine the best settings for any situation automatically.The camera comes with a USB cable to download photos to your computer, a proprietary battery and charger, wrist strap, plus photo software.  You will need to buy a MicroSD memory card; I thought I had one or more in the house, but found this card is smaller than the ones I had bought a few years back.I must also state that the red color of the camera body is MUCH more attractive than it appears in the photo on this page.  It is a beautiful red wine color, with an iridescent glow.  If you like gadgets in red, you will NOT be sorry buying the camera in this color, I assure you!I will report back if I encounter any drawbacks or problems.  (I saw one reviewer complaining about slow read/write to the memory card; after reading the camera instructions, I believe he needed to conduct a \"low-level\" formatting of his memory card, which is supposed to solve such a problem.)Until then, I am thrilled with this little gem and can't believe what a superb and convenient camera you can buy for the money...UPDATE: it was a beautiful, sunny, early spring day today, and I took a walking tour of lower Manhattan, bringing along this little Canon.  THIS MIGHTY MITE TAKES THE MOST INCREDIBLE PHOTOS!!!  EVERY single shot was perfectly exposed and in focus.In addition, I think there's something in this camera that even improves the photo composition.  The image stabilization works perfectly too, which is handy when you're zooming in on the top of a sixty-story building.Decades ago, I used a fine (and expensive) Nikkormat 35mm camera, and out of 100 photos there were sure to be a few clunkers.  I took 103 photos today, and every one was a winner!Trust me, folks, you will NOT be disappointed with this camera.  I only wonder why anyone would need anything larger or heavier to take great pictures; I don't think you do anymore.HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!!!", "Date": "February 24, 2013"}, {"Title": "Steal of a deal!", "Author": "Nikki", "ReviewID": "RNFP1TQ1VQN65", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "First and foremost I can tell you that I have been doing nothing but gushing over this camera since my husband and I bought it. For the price it is a perfect little point and shoot. And it literally is that. It took fantastic pictures right out of the box (well technically not, but I'll touch on that a little later). We didn't need to play with the settings or fuss with it in low light. The flash worked great and the face detection system is spot on. And I can't say enough about the optical zoom. There is not too many, if any, cameras out there at this price point with a 12x optical zoom. And it works great. You can zoom all the way to 12 and your shots still are sharp and crisp. Of coarse the digital zoom goes to 48x but you lose resolution the further you go. Now to touch on the out of box functionality. The one draw back with these cameras is no memory. And that is the case here. A couple shots is all you get unless you have a micro-sd ready to pop in. But those are quite inexpensive now and I popped an 8gb in and you can take over 3000 shots at full resolution. In closing, we loved this camera. We loved it so much we bought a second one so we can each have one. I got the cool blue colour though, red is his thing haha. But as DSLR users we totally appreciate the functionality of this little compact camera and fully endorse it. Happy shooting!", "Date": "September 2, 2013"}, {"Title": "seems a winner", "Author": "G. T. Spigel \"shutterbug\"", "ReviewID": "R2K3QAP5BBNPSG", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I purchased this camera a few weeks ago after having a canon powershot 710 is for 5 years. That camera had many attributes such as an optical viewfinder and AA batteries, but was only 6X optical zoom. I had tried other cameras over the last 1-2 years but the quality of the pictures was not good. This camera seems to be a winner. The pictures are nice and clear, the new cmos sensor works great in low light, it's very small so fits well in your shirt pocket, and it has 12X optical zoom. I'm not real enthused about the image browser software as the older canon zoom browser seemed easier to use but it's new for me. I had to by a micro SD card, there is no optical viewfinder, and it uses a rechargeable lithium battery, which seems to hold its charge well. It would be nice to have a printed manual rather than a CD for more in depth discussion of the camera but this is an industry trend. The movies are also quite good. I bought the camera at BJs where it was a little cheaper but had to buy the micro SD card which can be gotten cheaper online. All in all this camera seems like a winner and will update if my intial impression changes", "Date": "May 2, 2012"}, {"Title": "Noisiest camera ever owned.", "Author": "HCedrinks", "ReviewID": "R1FEOVLPHYH6VV", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "I was looking for a camera to replace my aging Casio EX-Z1000, which has served me well over the past 5 years or so. I wanted something with a similar form factor, with the expectation that a newer camera would naturally include newer (and better) technology. The EX-Z1000 was great, but had problems with color accuracy and excess noise even at moderate ISO settings (ISO 400 and above).I've heard good things about Canon point-and-shoots for a while, so I figured I would go with one this time around. I settled on the Elph 520 HS, which at that time had the best reviews among its siblings (the 1xx and the 3xx series).I immediately tested the 520 HS upon getting it, shooting somewhere around 20 images before charging it and another 60-70 images after. The shots ranged from very-low-light situations (dark hallway in my apartment) to relatively bright outdoor shots (overcast day, parking lot on edge of forest).First the pros. The 12x zoom was nice. Color accuracy is better than my old camera. The settings only went down to ISO 100, but that's acceptable. I consider megapixel count to be irrelevant; anything above 8 MP is good enough in my book. The IS feature seemed to work well enough, but my hands are pretty stable so my opinion might not count in this matter.Now the cons. In a word: NOISE. On the camera's built-in screen, everything seemed fine at first sight. But zooming in, I began to notice the extreme amount of noise present in nearly all the pictures. Even at ISO 100, the noise was still painfully obvious -- and that's just on the camera's LCD screen. Viewing the pictures on my computer merely exacerbated the problem -- even monochromatic objects shot under good lighting conditions exhibited innumerable slightly off-color pixel bunches. Textured objects fared much worse, to the point of becoming blurry and riddled with what seemed to be noise removal artifacts. I had problems with noise on my EX-Z1000, but never to this extent; if I didn't know better I'd swear that the 520 HS is trying *too* hard to eliminate noise, which actually results in *more* noise. The noise issue was so bad it made the camera's other shortcomings (somewhat confused autofocus, relatively weak flash) seem insignificant. If you plan on printing out photos at the standard 4R size, then this might not be an issue. But if, like me, you like to set your photos as desktop wallpapers (or print them at larger sizes) then look elsewhere for your camera needs. As for me, I'm returning this camera.", "Date": "May 17, 2012"}, {"Title": "Great camera, big zoom", "Author": "dclaar \"dclaar\"", "ReviewID": "R1K82GXFNEGYMZ", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I'm really happy with this camera. It takes great snapshots, and it is so small that I can always have it with me. Nobody will ever mistake it for a several thousand dollar DSLR, either in price, weight, or picture quality, but the 12x zoom in such a small package was the sweet spot for me. And lets face it, for most of us, being able to get the shot because you have your camera is much more important than the really high quality picture--that you're never going to blow up to room size anyway--that you would have got if only you hadn't left your big, heavy, awkward DSLR at home!Some folks have compared the quality to cell phones. There's no comparison. I can get shots that are just dark blobs on the iPhone. The battery is pretty small, though, so make sure you have two or three, which I have always done anyway (they're small, so it isn't that big a deal). Be careful if you buy an off brand battery: Many of them have LESS capacity. Don't go by the picture, many of them appear to be photoshopped to say 1000mAH, but the specs give you the real value. I picked up the Wasabi Power Battery for Canon NB-9L and Canon PowerShot SD4500 IS, ELPH 510 HS, ELPH 520 HS, ELPH 530 HS, and it seems OK so far, but I haven't rigorously tested it.

It takes amazing pictures!  I bought it because of the price, the 12x zoom and the image stabilization.  It has exceeded my expectations.  I like the small size too.  I have to admit, I don't use many of the \"bells and whistles\" that come on most cameras these days so I can't really speak to how well they work.  But if you are looking for a great camera that takes great pictures at a good price, this will absolutely fit the bill.  My only \"complaints\" are that the battery life is not that great (I just have an extra one always ready to go) and that the one I bought didn't come with a memory card so I had to buy that separately.

FYI, at this stage, this model is currently made in Japan. At under $300, I think they will be all made in China when they're in mass-production mode. My first impression on this camera is on its sleek design and trim. I bought the silver version, and am happy with my choice of color. I'm ok with the button lay-out. They are easy to navigate without the need of reading the manual. What I am not fond of is Canon's choice of using microSD card. I feel like the card can be broken at any minute.Now that I have owned this camera for a few day, I brought it out and took a couple pictures outdoor. To get the most of of this camera, users definitely have to get used to its scene modes. For outdoor photos, I think the color is fairly accurate in auto (program) mode. I tried other modes on the same subjects (grass, leaves, flowers...) and enjoyed the special effect the camera delivered. \"Soft focus\" gave a nice, creamy layer over the photo, while \"super vivid\" gave the green of leaves and grass a real eye-catching tone. Miniature effect is another fun mode I like...I haven't tried taking the video yet, but with the the build and picture quality, plus the reasonable price tag, this camera is a 5 stars for me currently.

Though I found that I really didn't use it's potential and it was really difficult to fit into my pocket and zoom was soso, after CES there are alot of things coming out in the next few months that look good so I decided to sell my LX7 and get something a bit more portable for the time being.A few things that i was look for in a camera-Takes high speed videos-Takes HD video-Decent zoom-decent continuous shooting-Fast AF and overall operation.-PocketableSo the LX7 did most of these with the exception of an iffy zoom and wasn't to pocketable. I saw this little puppy on ebay for a cool $75 and though bang what do I have to lose? Well I found I had alot to gain!Great things that it has that I want:It takes high speed video at 120fps (640x480) and 240fpsh (320x240) though I prefer the LX7's 720p @ 120fps this is doable for the random times I like to have it plus it does 240fps.Takes HD video, 1080p is only at 24fps rather than the 60fps that I was used to but honestly it's not a huge deal and video has zoom and autofocus on this camera which is great! though the AF is quite slow and I can't take photos during the video.This has a 12x zoom which I have no clue how with its size. I think it has somethng to do with the smaller 1/3' sensor thoughAs for speed the continuous shooting is up to like 6fps at 2.5 megapixels which is a far cry from other which do usually a minimum of 10fps at full resolution or up to 60fps though It's usable in the the times you need to use it.However I would like to mention most cameras seem to limit to only like a couple seconds with their burst, and even though this is like 6 fps I sat there for a good 10+ seconds and it never stopped it appears to just keep going and I'm only using a class 4 card. Also as for normal operation speed this thing never slows down, going through menus, AF speed, and looking at video is all very quick.This thing I can't get over how tiny it is, especially with the zoom and features. It is literally the exact same size of my credit cart and slightly thicker than my cellphone. When the lens is out at wide angle it is about a half inch out and at full telephoto it is only like an inch out maybe which is also strangely small!Cons are mostly comparisons I listed above, another one I didn't mention was low light performance is iffy, You really need whatever it is you are looking at the be still, when you do though it looks decent enough. Also like people say it takes micro sd, which isn't great but really not a big deal at all if it means I get a smaller camera.Overall I might think of keeping this, there are a couple cameras coming out soon with some great feature sets but are looking pricey and area  bit larger.

My old Elph was the same size, but the edges were rounded, so for some reason it feels much smaller.The bottom line:- I returned the camera, as it just wasn't enough of an improvement over my 4-year-old Elph.

Pictures are truly amazing. They look like a professional photographer took them.Well they should, I was a professional photographer.  Now I do it for fun.The DOWN side:  What happened Canon?  Battery life as compared to other Canon Elph units sucks.  After about 4 minutes of video and maybe 30 pictures the low battery icon starts flashing.  First Canon supplies only an 890 mAh battery.  There are many clones out there at 1200 mAh.  Second, Canon (at least on Amazon) does not supply a Micro SD card.  ( A local warehouse operation starting with a C provides the same camera with a case and the card.)Update:  Have used the camera for a few trips now.  Battery life seems to have improved a bit.  Dislike:  This camera comes with no memory card.  (see above recommendation on where to buy) Perhaps they don't want you to know it's a \"micro-SD\" card that's required.  That's a big dislike for me.  Fist it a pain to get in and out of the camera due to its size and placement.  Using the supplied cord to transfer pictures to the computer is convoluted as well.Update:  July 26, 2013 - If not for the 12 x 1 zoom, I'd dump this camera in favor of one of my older models.

Only read if you are buying for primarily video / vlog / vlogging ***", "Author": "Claire", "ReviewID": "R7L2TNO1UDRUN", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I have to give this product one star.  I feel bad doing this, but if you are like me and only plan on using the camera for video vlogs / vlogging, you will be disappointed.  I bought this camera because its small form factor and the video specifications, on paper, is an improvement compared to the ELPH 330 HS.  On paper, the 520 HS is superior in that it can record 1080p@30fps vs the 330 HS's 720p@30fps.  It is newer than the 330 HS, and its base price is higher.  There are positive reviews all over the web and there are not many negative reviews.  I could not, however, find reviews that specifically target video.  So I went for the 520 and hoped for the best.The camera feels solid, and I cannot knock it for its form factor and its performance when taking photos.  It seems to excel at taking photos, and its slim design makes it easy to carry in your pocket.  At first it seemed awesome as I recorded the first few videos.  I noticed that autofocus was not turned on, and I continued recording after I turned on the autofocus setting.  Once I started to edit the clips, I heard a sound that resembles a mix between a metal click and a plastic click.  It is repetitive and consistent.  At the bottom of this review I will provide a link so you can hear the sound I'm describing.  I first thought that the sound could be coming from the plastic dongle of the wrist strap hitting the side of the camera as I moved around.  It made sense and it would explain the metal / plastic sound I heard.  After removing the strap, however, the sound continued.  I noticed that the microphone is embedded into the metal ring around the lens.  Usually the microphone is under the flash (as in the 330 HS).  This small difference actually makes a rather large impact on the audio quality and makes the 520 HS's microphone super sensitive to any motion of the lens.Once I became aware of the root cause, I searched for any reviews that referenced the same problem.  I found only one review that I would consider a trustworthy source (PC magazine-  [...] )  PC magazine hit the nail on the head and noticed the issue, but since they were mostly focused on photo specs, the problem only received one sentence in their page long review.  Here is what PC magazine says: \u201cThe camera can zoom and focus while recording, but the sound of its lens moving in and out is audible on the soundtrack.\"  I read the PC magazine review prior to purchasing this camera, but the issue did not stand out.  Furthermore, the 330 HS has the same sound issue when focusing, but the *key* difference is that the 330 HS has a faster autofocus mechanism, and on top of that, the microphone is below the flash.  Both of these factors diminish the sound from the lens in the 330 HS.  Since the microphone is literally on top of the lens in the 520 HS, the sound of the lens is amplified rather than filtered out.  It was very disappointing and I can\u2019t believe Canon did not pick up on this during QA.  I don\u2019t understand the benefit of moving the microphone into the lens.Lastly, I am not the only one with this problem.  There are two other popular vloggers that I know of who recently upgraded to the 520 and their initial reviews were positive.  After a few weeks of video, however, they also noticed the problem.  Since they use several different camera models simultaneously, it took longer for them to catch this issue.  During this time, however, I bought the camera.  So if you plan on buying this camera for primarily video work (such as vlogging), DON\u2019T buy this camera!!!  Go with the 330 HS instead.-Michael & ClaireOne of my videos that highlight the issue:  [...] (listen at 3:35 but it happens throughout the video).

Let me use my usual disclaimer, in the interest of fairness, and admit that many cameras by reputable makers (and there are many) deliver what they promise. It is more about what camera traits you are looking for. So, I would suggest to anyone looking to buy one to google 'camera trait search' and get the whole picture.The ELPH520 is a fixed lens camera (point and shoot, some would say), with 10.1 resolution (megapixels), and a x12 zoom (up from x10 on the ELPH 330). The sensor size is 1/2.3 inch CMOS-type, which is standard for cameras of its class.If you were to, say, take pictures of friends and family at an outdoor gathering, this camera is what you need. If you get ambitious, there will be stumbling blocks. Here is the camera's trait mix: It does not have a viewfinder, which, again, many in its class don't. The ISO rating, which is the gauge for how well it does in low light, is 3200. That rating is lower than many others, but it is sufficient for most purposes. The video is a Full HD- that is 1980x1080 resolution. It does not have a hot shoe for an external flash option. That is not unexpected for its size and category. The LCD screen is a 461,000 resolution. The camera does not do RAW processing but you would need only if you did not want to be limited by JPEG type storage. The burst rate is a reasonable 2.4 frames persecond- great for quick shots. The weight of the camera is a convenient 155 grams.The main difference between the ELPH series starting 300s is the new Digic 5 processor, and CMOS sensor instead of CCD. The ELPH 110, and 115 had Digic 4.Overall, nice, fun camera. Having been into photography for a while, I do stress though that you do a camera trait search.

I am a light-use camera user (mostly use the camera for vacation pictures and cute pet moments). I wanted a Canon camera that was inexpensive, quick to turn on, could photograph in more resolutions (especially 1:1), and would have a general increase in picture quality over the IS 1200.I've been using this camera for a few months now. General impressions:--Really pleased with the picture quality improvement over the 1200 IS. It does much better in low light, and in general, the colors appear richer.--It is super small, about the size of a deck of cards. The case I was using for the 1200 IS is a little loose on the ELPH 520.--The camera menu navigation buttons on the back of the camera differ from the vast majority of other Canon cameras, and I HATED it at first. There's no external \"delete picture\" button and I couldn't easily find a delete option in the menus; I actually had to get out the manual and look for instructions in order to find it. This camera takes 4-5 clicks to delete a picture instead of 3 because is does not have an external delete button.--Battery life isn't as good as the 1200 IS. I only use mine in short bursts, but I still noticed that the camera needed recharging sooner than my IS would've at similar rates of use.--Uses a microSD card for storage. I fortunately already owned a USB microSD card reader, but for others, it's not as widely used as SD cards.I am mostly satisfied with this camera. I think that it is a good camera for the money, and I definitely prefer its photo quality to the 1200 IS.

I compared the photo quality to my 500D and it's not a fair comparison (DSLR vs P&S;). Once I stopped comparing the photo quality and just accepted that this is a compact travel camera that will take decent pictures, I stopped worrying about photo quality so much.The microSD cards are TINY but just buy a big one and leave it in the camera (so you're not constantly swapping them out). Otherwise you will lose it in no-time.Update 1:Took the camera to Disney World for three days. Took about 75-100 pictures in all types of conditions. I didn't spend enough time to learn the manual settings (my fault--there are a lot of settings). I only had to swap out the battery once. The zoom was great and allowed me to get close to the animals and for those ride shots without having to resort to digital zoom or cropping. The recycle time in-between shots is a touch slower than I'd like but if you turn off photo preview (after taking a picture), it will respond faster. I haven't dissected the picture quality yet but will post an update when I do.Update 2:Actually took closer to 300 pictures on 1.5 batteries. Pretty good!I printed a bunch of pics out and the quality was great (4x6).

Jones \"kjay12\"", "ReviewID": "R1E6QQD53IB0Y8", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "I am a professional photographer and I am almost always seen lugging around my DSLR with all my lenses. But there are times when I want a good camera, but can't carry all my equipment with me. Enter the ELPH 520 HS. I bought this because it was small, it has an incredible 12x optical zoom, a large LCD screen, it will \"burst shoot\", and it takes HD video at the touch of a button. First of all let me say that I understand this is not a DSLR so it will never live up to those standards, however there are a few things that I felt really should have performed better:-If it isn't a bright, sunny day (or a brightly lit scene) forget trying to get ANYTHING in focus with this camera even if your subject is moving only slightly.-Even if conditions are optimum, the image quality of this camera is only so-so. There seems to be a lot of grain and noise and it's quite distracting.-The HD video is very underwhelming. The camera seemed to be confused most of the time when trying to focus. It would constantly change focus on different subjects which I found to be absolutely maddening. The video itself looked more like SD to me (and yes, I did check the settings to make sure I was shooting in full HD). The camera boasts the ability to zoom in and out while filming without losing focus on the subject. Yeah, right. I had no luck with this. Every time I would try to adjust the zoom, the video would lose clarity and there was also the annoying sound of the motor while zooming in and out which is then recorded onto your video. Hmmm...-The buttons are confusing. They are placed in a strange configuration IMO and I had a hard time changing settings with any speed at all. I realize they had to be placed this way in order to fit on the camera at all, but one thing that would have helped tremendously is to have the \"SET\" button in the middle of the arrow buttons like it is on most Canon PowerShot models.Overall, I would have to say that I really wouldn't recommend this camera. I sold it after 8 months of use and went back to using my old Canon Powershot SX100 IS. This camera may be old, but it outperforms the ELPH 520 in terms of image quality and video quality (even though it is only SD).", "Date": "March 16, 2013"}, {"Title": "nice compact camera", "Author": "chchips1", "ReviewID": "RY0YTOVSCTZAW", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I've only had the camera a short while but I'm looking forward to using it.

I use the camera to take pictures and videos for my Rotary Club  and use it for personal use like everyone else.I am not able to download the videos to Picassa. This is where I make any modifications and put them in web albums, etc. I then put the videos on my Rotary Club's website or in personal web albums. I have never had a problem with the other camera. With this camera you can use the supplied interface cable or as suggested by the Canon representative via a rapid-response email (which I commend) put the micro memory card in an Adapter and then download the videos to  a memory card reader  to my computer. Well that didn't work either. It will download to Canon's software but that doesn't help me. I was wondering if anyone else has had this problem? I did not read any customer reviews regarding downloading the videos.Also, when you view and listen to the video on the camera the speaker is in the front of the camera and you have to put your ear to the front of the camera to hear anything. - No I don't have a hearing problem, and I did turn the volume up but I really don't think that control increases the volume much if any. Why would they put the speaker on the front of the camera while you are looking at the video on the back of the camera? It doesn't make sense.Before I bought the camera I did read the  customer reviews on Amazon (Amazon did have the best price) and knew to buy a Micro memory card.So has anyone had the same problem I have with downloading videos to Picassa?I can't be the only one.Is the internal video formatting different than  in the older but dependable (except for the broken door which prevents the camera from being operated) camera? If I can't download to Picassa this camera is nice looking  but is totally useless for transferring videos! - Help", "Date": "January 2, 2013"}, {"Title": "I sent this back.", "Author": "Amy Royal", "ReviewID": "R3995AOPK023IG", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "this camera is totally out of date.
