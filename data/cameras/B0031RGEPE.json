Lens[ 4.7-23.5mm 1:2.8-6.5 ]OVERALL feeling: (4.8 of 5)It has pretty clear picture taking capabilites and is very USER FRIENDLY.  Panaramic function works amazingly well.  The camera itself is a great size and looks pretty slick, it doesn't look like a cheap camera.  I think anyone would be happy with this purchase.  It has a HDMI port and can take SDHC memory cards.  You charge the camera battery with the battery in the camera, and the power cord is plugged into the camera itself, that is a nice feature, to not have to pull the battery out all the time to charge(like the coolpix i have).  The buttons light up when touched momentarily and the camera has a nice power save option; all nice features.HD VIDEO: (4.8 of 5) Not too shabby, volume is a little low, but im pretty sure there is a speaker option.  I noticed it today.  It definitely is always a nice feature to be able to capture video, in High Def no less.  Only downside is that you can't take pictures while video recording, i like that option on my DSLR.Lighting: (4.3 of 5) you have a few different options depending on location: sunny, cloudy, what type of indoor lighting i.e 3 different flourescent settings and 1 incandescent.  Weird thing is cloudy works better indoors under flourescent light better than all the flourescent settings.  Very slight exageration of the yellow hue.  Cloudy whittens things up and makes the room look as if it were under regular incandescent bulb lights.  All in all, you can place it on WB auto, and the setting the camera auto selects works better than fine.I am quite satisfied and feel anyone else would be as well..and i spent 250 buying from an overpriced Postal Exchange lol.", "Date": "October 13, 2010"}, {"Title": "Near perfect", "Author": "Old Jim in TX", "ReviewID": "R3KKUFD296X0Z", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I have used cameras of one type or another for close to 50 years.  Had my own darkroom back in the days of film.  Have had digital models since 1M was as big as they got.  Wanted a small one to carry around. Cell phone cam is just too much trouble and too limited.Read all the reviews for all the small Olympus, Cannon, Panasonic, et al.  Used my girlfriend's Cannon.  Decided that since an old Olympus E100RS Sports Photographers model was the best I have EVER used I would stay with the brand.I love this little thing!  It is hard to hold still on long tele shots and I doubt I will ever get used to not having a viewfinder but I still love it.  Have used it in Program mode mostly and played with some programed Scene shooting.  Love the Super Macro best of all.  Have some great close ups of my honeybees.Does everything it is supposed to and does it well.  People who have had problems using it just didn't Read The F****** Manual.  I downloaded the manual from Olympus's web page as soon as I ordered the camera.  I enjoyed reading about it while I waited for it.  Didn't wait long.  Amazon got it to me in record time.  Ordered late Monday, used free delivery, still had it on Friday. Thanks Amazon!I don't like the software that came with it.  Uninstalled it on day two.", "Date": "April 17, 2011"}, {"Title": "Good results for a fair price", "Author": "S. J. Bennett", "ReviewID": "R2FO02EDOXR1CK", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "This camera takes mainly good photos straight out of the box. There's no real need to play with the settings which I like. My main use for this camera is photographing people, and I preferred using the standard Auto setting as opposed to the portrait scene setting - in portrait, the pictures were mostly a little too pink. The standard auto setting reproduces skin tones nicely. It does seem to be a little soft on detail indoors though - you can't really tell it's 14mp unless you're outdoors on a sunny day.One gripe is the processing speed - even with a quick card, after you take a photo it takes a good 8 seconds before the camera is ready to take another one. That's annoying if you just missed 'the' shot, and then the next opportunity happens while you're waiting for the camera to sort itself out.The video quality could also be better - especially on the sound front, and it suffers badly from over exposure in sunny outdoor settings. So don't buy this camera if you're looking for the best of both worlds, but if you just want good pictures for a reasonable price this is a contender.", "Date": "December 25, 2010"}, {"Title": "Big Kudos For My Little Camera", "Author": "AniMaeWest", "ReviewID": "R28NWVVELCC3JZ", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I love my little Olympus Stylus 5010 14 MP Digital Camera with 5x Wide Angle Dual Image Stabilized Zoom and 2.7-inch LCD (Titanium) purchase through Amazon! I have owned several small cameras and they have all performed poorly (not through Amazon). But not this little guy, I can't leave home without him. This 5010 is rugged, light, easy to use and the MENUS ARE SO EASY TO USE AND NAVIGATE THROUGH! My fat fingers are not an issue with the basic dial-a-menu scheme. My only irk is when I'm reviewing images on the camera I almost always touch the shoot button and the image disappears, I have never had a successful hand off to someone else to show them a stored image. But that's common with most cameras, so no real gripe, I just want to show my little gem off all the time. Some people have stated that 14mg is overkill. But,  I took a photo of something that didn't show up to well in the shot, it was nice and clear, but tiny. Then I zoomed in while previewing the image and there is was, exactly what I wanted, that little tiny image I was going for filled the whole LCD screen! That's what 14 MP's is for.  I love the pinhole and B&W; settings and the manual settings are a blast! Oh, if you depress the entire dial button while the camera is off, the date and time is displayed for a few seconds; NICE!", "Date": "May 30, 2011"}, {"Title": "\"This tiny camera will blow you away\" is right!", "Author": "James Johnson", "ReviewID": "R3IIMV0QJN99G3", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "While visiting Amazon, I bought this camera on an impulse, mainly because of its low price, $87.99, and the highly respected reputation of Olympus. The manufacturer says, \"This tiny camera will blow you away\", and are they right! I've only had mine a few days and am already amazed at the image quality and abundance of features on this little gem. The 14mp images are really outstanding for a camera of this price or any price for that matter. Two particular features that have truly \"blown me away\" are the HD video and the panorama mode for still images. The one-button HD recording is a major plus and the video is astounding! But the panorama mode is just incredible, using the auto mode is so simple, just take two or three consecutive photos, lining up the pointers on the screen as you do so and then sit back and watch the camera build the panoramic photo...unbelievable and so easy! Also love the in camera editing that can be done, particularly the Beauty Fix...granted it's not Photoshop, but, hey, it only cost $87.99! I haven't been this excited over a new camera since I acquired my Nikon D200 a couple of years ago.

I spent hours pouring through the point and shoot cameras available on Amazon, before deciding to go with the Olympus Stylus 5010. No other camera combines the features, quality, and price that this camera brings. I ordered it and received the camera after four days. I could not be more pleased with this device. The first thing I noticed was that it was very small, both in length and width, something that the product photo does not accurately portray. This worried me at first, but I tested it out and taking photos and navigating the menus were a cinch. The camera comes with a usb cable, a charger head, an av cable, a Lithium ion rechargeable battery and instructions (there is a full user manuel on the Olympus website).I took some test shots, both with and without flash, and was highly impressed. The 14 megapixels really show its power when even after zooming all the way in playback mode, the picture remained clear and sharp. I took some close up shots, and despite my hand noticeably shaking, the pictures remained focused, even with the flash off. The only gripe I had was that the color was a tad bit drab for my liking. You can also capture video at 720p simply by pressing a large red button, which is a very handy feature.The 2.7 inch screen is spacious and very clear, though as an earlier reviewer mentioned, the pictures look much better from your computer than the camera screen. I recommend buying some sort of screen protector as well, since the screen is not \"edged inward\" whatsoever.Overall, I was more than pleased with the capabilities of the camera, especially considering the price it is being offered at.

This camera, besides being a beautiful blue color, is excellent! HD video is great and pictures are great too! There are only a few cons to this camera that I've discovered. First, the place where you put in the battery and SD card, the covering is removed and holds onto the camera with two plastic hinges, whereas my Nikon has a sliding opening. I am extra cautious that I am not too hard on them and not to break them! Secondly, if you are shooting towards direct sunlight, it has a tendency to make stripes appear on the image.

This one is better in some ways but a lot worse in others. Basically the image stabilization is horrible. That is my biggest disappointment. I bought this camera for my mom's wedding and all the pictures of us taken going down the aisle are extremely blurry (my cousin took them from one of the tables). If you don't hold it extremely still for a few seconds the picture will not turn out. This is also the case if the subject is moving and having a chihuahua, my subject is often moving. I'm not sure if I just don't have the settings right but it seems like there is absolutely no image stabilization which is something I really need and really liked on my last camera. The good things about it are the quality of the HD video and images. The HD video is actually very nice. I am happy with the sound too. Still images also turn out very nice, even in dark rooms (I don't like to use the flash).Overall, there are some really nice things about this camera but the one thing that I needed, it fell short on.", "Date": "June 29, 2011"}, {"Title": "LCD screen fails; camera now dead.", "Author": "Thomas T.

I don't know if it's the pixels burning out or something else, but it makes the camera frustrating to use, since you can't actually see what is in the picture at those locations.  I'm generally extremely careful with my possessions, so it wasn't a matter of physical abuse or damage.  To top it off, one of the cameras now refuses to power-on.

It just won't \"initialise\" on a Mac, which means that (the first time you use it) you have set the time and date manually.

An AC adapter is included, but I've never had the battery die on me in one day's use. The image stabilisation is both mechanical and optical. The \"optical\" part means that it increases the ISO speed to compensate for shaking. Changing the ISO speed changes the picture. I just use the 2-second timer, which gives me plenty of time to stabilise the camera after clicking the shutter.The spectrum graph is very useful (read the manual) as it shows you if the picture is too dark or bright.

But, where it really matters--the photo quality--it's lacking.Compared to our cheaper/older Kodak Easyshare C613 ($100 3 years ago), this camera just doesn't take crisp high-quality pictures in anything less than bright, sunny days outdoors, despite adjusting its settings.  In such good conditions, photos are bright and vivid, and we have several good daytime photos from our trip thanks to this camera.  On the flip side, we gave up on using it indoors, as those photos always turned out blurry.  Always, regardless of settings.  Surprisingly, I think this camera takes much better video than still images (even in low lighting--which doesn't make much sense to me).  So, we've made this our \"video\" camera, while the Kodak is back to being our main camera for photos.When the conditions are good (which is rare), this is a good camera.

Maybe people are using it for outdoor sports photography, and maybe it works OK for that? As far as regular indoor shots go, Don't buy this camera! I can't believe that it is 14M pixel. My old 6M pixel camera that is 8 years old takes pictures that are of similar quality to this.If I had a chance to look at some of the images it produces before buying, I would have looked onward to another camera in the same price range.I would have been willing to buy a more expensive camera if I knew that $118 would only get me this..But I think that I still can get a decent camera for just over $100, this is not that camera.This camera produces the kind of photographs that one would expect from a smartphone, which can be had for a little more money. I guess I was hoping for better quality images from something whos sole purpose is to take pictures. That's what a camera is for.I am terribly disappointed with this purchase, and I really want my money back.", "Date": "December 28, 2011"}, {"Title": "Friendly", "Author": "limordrori", "ReviewID": "R290D0YILYHV1Z", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Very friendly camera - friendly to use.

The camera was working fine, took nice pictures and I was able to take a 30 minute video for school.  However, when I went to use if for our Christmas party, the shutter would not close.  The camera still turns on and can take pictures but the shutter errors and remains open at all times.This camera is also very user unfriendly when it comes to uploading photos.  I had connectivity problems with the camera and my computer (HP) almost every time that I plugged in.  Eventually the two would communicate but it always took some finagling.There were some positives.  It takes nice photos.  Got me an A on my video presentation.

My 3.2-megapixel camera phone takes higher quality photos. I have tried taking pictures with all the settings, in dark light and in sun light, and they all seem fuzzy.
