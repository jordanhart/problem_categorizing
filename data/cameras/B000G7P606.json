I did a fair amount of online research before buying this item and despite some flaws, I'm still a satisfied user.Pro:- It works. One room away, the picture is very very good. Gets worse farther away (no surprise)- Great features & flexibility. Have always been able to find ways to hang or position the cameras so they can view the kids - not always impossible with other models- Supports multiple cameras (great for covering several kids and/or multiple rooms)Con:- Audio has a lot of static, even when the picture is clear- The power cord for the monitor plugs into the unit inside the battery compartment, so you can't leave batteries loaded. Dumb design- One of the three channels (#2) knocks out the wifi in our house, so we can only use two cameras. Fortunately the unit operates on two other channels, so we can still use those cameras without interfering with the Wifi- Cost of the base package plus extra cameras is too highGood luck!", "Date": "February 23, 2008"}, {"Title": "Good view, bad reception.", "Author": "C.

None of them are wonderful, but the monitor portion works well.  We have a lot of interference in our house, so we cannot use the audio portion of the monitor, but we have not found it necessary:  a picture is worth a thousand words. The sensor portion is great, so the monitor will turn on when the baby moves- the closer the camera, the better it works.  The others I tried didn't have this option. But I would recommend a video monitor over a audio monitor any day.", "Date": "July 20, 2008"}, {"Title": "Great video, not so great audio, and cumbersome design", "Author": "M. Felton \"CrazyMike\"", "ReviewID": "R25SMGY7DBB8ZF", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "We have been using this unit for 11 months now and it works very well (all over our somewhat small house).  We have had no range problems, but it does get interference with wifi and our cordless phone.  The interference impacts the audio more than the video, so we use it with the sound turned down and use a different, more portable audio monitor to carry with us.After 11 months of tough use the screen protector is cracked, and AC plug is broken in some way (only works with batteries).  But alot of others out there seem to have bad ratings and so we are going to buy another set, and this way have 2 cameras.", "Date": "April 1, 2008"}, {"Title": "Good camera, okay receiver.  Excellent Amazon customer service!", "Author": "R. Chang", "ReviewID": "R2TNPRPXW4TIWF", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I recieved the camera very promptly but the reciever wasn't working and Amazon quickly shipped a replacement without any hassle!The camera works well and the picture is good in total darkness.  I put a piece of electrical tape over the motion detector indicator light because it flashes when it detects movement.  It would be nice if the indicator light could be turned off.The reciever's battery life isn't very good at all. I would say the 4 AAA batteries have a life around 6-8 hours total.  The way it's designed, the AC adapter plug is located inside the battery housing so you have to remove the batteries while it's plugged into the wall.I've never used any other video camera systems, but I would recommend this one if the price was about $50 lower and the design was improved a little.", "Date": "February 8, 2008"}, {"Title": "Don't Buy This Monitor!", "Author": "Tommy D. Le \"szrice\"", "ReviewID": "R1WRE8PH19YT7O", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I spent 2 months researching monitors to buy reading every single stinkin' baby book, website, visiting store after store. Thought I would go with the most expensive one with the latest whizbang technology [2.4GHz transmission]. Bad choice, this monitor had static everything. Video staticky, sound horrible. All I heard was a lot of static. If you turn the sound up to hear your child, you also turn up the very loud static. The monitor unit can use 4 AAA batteries. One review said it sucked up batteries like they have never seen. I thought they were exaggerating. I placed brand new Duracell AAA batteries into the monitor and it drained the entire set in 10min. Basically, useless unless it is plugged in which makes it NOT portable. The best thing that ever happened to me with this really really expensive unit is that the monitor broke in a little over a year and we just bought a \"Summer Day&Night; Handheld color video monitor\" which uses 900MHz [old school] wireless technology. Holy cow--day and night experience. Brilliant design, no static, works like a charm without having to sell a kidney or your 1st born. Goes to show that money and the latest technology do not necessarily equal a better product. Q-See does do a lot of home security but they completely dropped the ball with this monitor and must have been using ITT flunkies to design and build this crappy monitor and sell it for outrages amounts while they laughed all the way to the bank. Lesson learned for me is to never buy Q-See products again. Go with the Summer Day&Night; and you can thank me later.", "Date": "August 21, 2010"}, {"Title": "Worked well for 1 year, then video crapped out", "Author": "Yimmie", "ReviewID": "RGXDLSFYH0PIP", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "We purchased this exact model from Costco for our baby's room and it worked well for about a year.  Then suddenly the video image was full of zigzags and it became impossible to see anything useful.  Nothing in our config had changed and no new wireless devices have been added in our home.  I've tried all the troubleshooting tips and nothing works, so I guess it's time for a new monitor, except the next one won't be from Qsee.", "Date": "June 14, 2009"}, {"Title": "Have owned & loved for over 1 year", "Author": "L.

It is so comforting to be able to SEE and HEAR - we are expecting a 2nd child and ordered this one for our next nursery. I'll be anxious to try 2 cameras.
