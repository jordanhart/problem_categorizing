{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Very good camera, good value kit", "Author": "Linux Administrator", "ReviewID": "R6W4EZEGVZKC6", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "At a price only slightly higher than just the camera, Cameta Camera adds some useful items.  Let me briefly comment on each:Kit includes:\u2666 1) Panasonic Lumix DMC-FZ70 Digital Camera (Black) -- Reviewed in depth by others.  It's a good 60x superzoom camera if you don't expect more than its tiny 1/2.3\" sensor can deliver.  A few similar cameras may produce slightly clearer pictures, but the FZ70 offers wider wide angle.  That's unique.\u2666 2) Transcend 32GB SecureDigital (SDHC) 300x UHS-1 Class 10 Memory Card -- Not the fastest card but fast enough for this purpose.\u2666 3) Spare DMW-BMB9 Battery for Panasonic -- Charged spares are always nice to have in reserve.\u2666 4) Zeikos 50\" ZE-TR26A Compact Travel Tripod -- The equivalent version I got was Vivitar, a very lightweight tripod that would be challenged by a breeze.  It can support the camera for group photos indoors, but don't expect a stable platform for 1200mm telephoto shots outdoors.\u2666 5) Zeikos 3-Piece Multi-Coated Glass Filter Kit (55mm UV/FLD/CPL) -- Yes, it's glass, but the CPL filter shows no evidence whatsoever of polarizing light.  It's more like a weak neutral density filter.  Disappointing: CPL was the only filter I wanted, and it doesn't work.  The box says that filters are multi-coated but I doubt it, since they show strong surface reflections.  This is a dud.\u2666 6) Precision Design PD-C10 Camera/Camcorder Case -- Simple but fully functional.  It fits the camera and a couple of small accessories, such as the charger and the spare battery.\u2666 7) Precision Design USB 2.0 SecureDigital (SDHC) High-Speed Memory Card Reader -- The version I got was made by Xit Photo.  It measures only 1.5\" and works well.\u2666 8) Precision Design 5-Piece Camera & Lens Cleaning Kit -- Should be useful.\u2666 9) Precision Design Universal LCD Screen Protectors -- You have to cut those to size, but they work well to protect the LCD screen from scratches.\u2666 10) Precision Design Memory Card Storage Wallet -- Makes it slightly harder to lose memory cards.\u2666 11) ImageRecall Digital Image Recovery Software -- Not useful to me, but one can download this software if needed.  The Transcend memory card included a link to something similar.My conclusion?  The rating is mostly based on camera performance, which is very good, but can't compete with larger sensor cameras.  What makes this camera special is the zoom: it delivers tremendous versatility in a relatively small package (size comparison to DSLR cameras with similar focal length lenses are downright funny).  Ergonomics, camera settings & operation work for me.  Image quality is adequate for this type of camera.The rest of the kit is a mixed bag, but justifies a slightly higher price.  Overall, I'm happy with the camera case, extra battery, memory card & card reader, screen protectors, and even the cleaning kit.  These items justify the $25 premium (including shipping) over the camera alone.  However, the filters and the tripod are simply inadequate.", "Date": "October 5, 2013"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": "$399.95", "Features": "KIT INCLUDES 11 PRODUCTS -- All BRAND NEW Items with all Manufacturer-supplied Accessories + Full USA Warranties:\n<1> Panasonic Lumix DMC-FZ70 Digital Camera (Black) + <2> Transcend 32GB SDHC 300x Card +\n<3> Spare DMW-BMB9 Battery + <4> Zeikos 50\" Compact Tripod + <5> 55mm 3pc (UV/FLD/CPL) Filter +\n<6> PD-C10 Camera / Camcorder Case + <7> PD SDHC Memory Card Reader + <8> PD 5pc Complete Cleaning Kit +\n<9> LCD Screen Protectors + <10> PD Memory Card Storage Wallet + <11> Image Recovery Software", "Name": "Panasonic Lumix DMC-FZ70 Digital Camera (Black) with 32GB Card + Battery + Case + 3 UV/FLD/CPL Filters + Tripod + Accessory Kit", "ImgURL": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/61v0EnaBTXL._SY300_.jpg", "ProductID": "B00E3W3WVK"}}
