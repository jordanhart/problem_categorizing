Despite it's low price this is the worst camera I have ever tested or used. As a semiprofessional photographer I have tried a number of cameras from point and click to SLR.First off the construction is very flimsy. It is 100% light weight plastic. In fact the first commentmy daughter made was \"It Feels Like A Toy!\".Due to it's low price I was not expecting much from this but I was at least hoping for it to produce clear photos. Well it can't even do that!Every shot I or my daughter took no matter the lighting was blurred and grainy. I have taken better pictures using a disposable 35mm that cost $4.99.If you are looking for a low cost first time camera keep looking.", "Date": "May 4, 2010"}, {"Title": "Cheap first camera", "Author": "Loadnabox", "ReviewID": "R392KKK08A5ZOV", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "Gave it as a Christmas present to my niece.  Unfortunately I didn't realize that it didn't have a flash.  It doesn't do very well in indoor lighting conditions so it only takes decent pictures outdoors.  Even outdoors the exposure time is slow so action shots are blurry.As a first ever camera for my niece it was cheap and made sure she knew how to take care of her expensive electronics.  A new camera soon followed however to make sure she had a camera that could take pictures she could be proud of.", "Date": "June 20, 2011"}, {"Title": "Piece of Junk, Save Your Money", "Author": "Seth Kaufman \"Seth Kaufman\"", "ReviewID": "RE7JRSQ50TS5L", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "This is a poorly made and poor functioning camera.  My cell phone takes better pictures.We only purchased this camera because we were on vacation in a remote location and both or our good digital cameras malfunctioned half way through our week long vacation.  The Vivitar Freelance V15 was the only inexpensive digital camera for sale in a local big box store and we took a chance on it.The LCD screen is impossible to view in bright daylight which means that you will have to frame your shots with the view finder instead of the screen.  In addition, it is impossible to read the instructions &/or see the symbols that are displayed on the LCD screen when you are in an outdoor location.The biggest drawback to this camera is that all of the photos and the videos in the camera's memory will be lost if the batteries run down before you download the pictures to your computer or if you accidentally remove the batteries before you download the pictures from the camera.  This information is not printed in the Quick Start Guide that is part of the retail packaging for this camera.The latch to the battery compartment on our camera failed and the batteries lost contact with the camera and as a result we lost approx. 30 pictures.Don't waste your money on this turkey.Vivitar Vivicam V15 1.3 Megapixel Digital Camera - Red", "Date": "April 19, 2011"}, {"Title": "Save Your Money & Apply It Toward Something Else", "Author": "Doggymcnuggets \"doggymcnuggets\"", "ReviewID": "R3O139B1P8E6MF", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "My 6 year old son wanted his own camera, and with Dad's advice not to spend too much of his money he bought this inexpensive camera at a local chain retailer.  That'll teach him not to listen to Dad!  He was super excited...until we opened the packaging and went to put the batteries in.  The battery compartment door broke the very first time we opened it.  This camera is incredibly flimsy, hence the cheap plastic latch that holds the battery door in place broke off immediately.  That's actually the best thing that could have happened, as it necessitated us returning it without any time to question whether or not to keep it.  For kicks we took some sample pictures with it by holding the battery compartment shut with one hand, and the pictures were just awful - all of them were blurry and the images are very low-res.  I've had lower end cell phones with pretty mediocre cameras and they all put this thing to shame.  This in no way qualifies as a real camera, so take my advice: save your twenty bucks and put it toward some other camera - any other camera but this one!  Seriously, you can find decent budget priced cameras from quality makers (Canon, Kodak, etc) on sale for not much more than fifty dollars, so save up until you can afford one of those.  The old saying goes \"you get what you pay for,\" but in this case you get even less.", "Date": "August 6, 2011"}, {"Title": "FAIR FOR THE PRICE", "Author": "POLKY", "ReviewID": "R3R9WF7YK2KG1X", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "THE CAMERA IS NOT TOO BAD IF YOU WANT SOMETHING FOR YOURCHILDREN TO LEARN ON. WITH THE LOW PRICE YOU WONT BE MADIF THEY DESTROY IT. THE CAMERA IS OK FOR OUTDOOR USE. IWOULD NOT RECOMEND INDOOR USE DUE TO THE FACT THE CAMERADOES NOT HAVE A FLASH. THE BIG PROBLEM WITH THE CAMERA ISTHE SOFTWARE. THE CD PROVIDED HAS ERRORS IN IT AND CANNOTLOAD PROPERLY INTO YOUR COMPUTER. AFTER DOING A LITTLE RESEARCHON THE WEB, THIS IS COMMON FOR VIVTAR. I HAD TO DOWNLOADSOFTWARE OFF OF A WEBSITE TO GET THE CAMERA TO WORK.
