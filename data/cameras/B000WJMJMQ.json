I had the A10, A30 and now the A40 and they are all great cameras. This has easy access to flash options (off, on, red eye, soft etc) as well as focal lengths (macro, super macro, infinity etc). The screen is nearly as big as the camera and makes for great viewing of your photos and movies. The flash works pretty good, even up to distances of greater than 20 feet. It's really easy to set up and understand. The zoom is steady and you can view the screen all the time you're zooming with little or no distortion. I notice a slight purple cast from outdoor light coming in from windows (indoors), but I have a Canon sd950is that does the same thing, so I think this is something with most if not all digital cameras. It's so small and light it's really nice to carry around and the photos are really fantastic. The anti shake is the best I've seen on any brand of digital camera, I have a 16 month old I'm always chasing around, so I really appreciate the anti shake feature. It's a hundred dollars less then the Canon and I'm not sure why because I like the Pentax better.", "Date": "April 22, 2008"}, {"Title": "Good camera, kind of slow", "Author": "Gregory J.

This also causes the camera fires red eye reduction flash (when is not necessary) and the battery runs low too fast. You can not change the zoom in movie mode(while recording).

I particularly love the 'double flower' mode that gets me to the short hair.I take some pictures of small machinery, like phone parts, and electronic gadgets, and the double flower mode gets me in there just fine.On the down side, i find that occasionally, the focus seems to be just bad.  I think i am not giving it enuf time to think, but even when i give it time, it just blows the focus entirely.  Since i have lots of memory (4 gigs), my answer to this is simply to take multiple shots of the same item.Battery time tween charges seems a bit short, but not impossible. I charge on average every 3- 4 days with about 30 pix a day.I am still failing to get the movies to show on my puter. Something aboutDV... mode. Irfanview won't deal.

(updated to four stars 7/3/09)", "Author": "erictheelephant \"IronBuddha\"", "ReviewID": "R3G0SUXAYWKK7Q", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "***(READ UPDATED 7/3/09 COMMENT ON BOTTOM!)***I'm writing this because even though I spent much less than retail on this camera, I am disappointed. I was convinced by the reviews that I was getting a spectacular deal, but either mine is defective, or everyone else has low expectations. I have used this camera for about 2 months, so I know how frustrating this camera really is.I have always used Canon or Olympus, and I wanted to stray and try something different. My mistake, Pentax's autofocus takes forever to focus, then when I snap the picture, it's blurry. I get clear pictures only 1/2 to 2/3rds of the time. This is particularly frustrating when you're spending great effort to get kids to stay still for the shot, then snap, it's another lousy shot. I was taking pictures in clear daylight, holding the button halfway, waited a few seconds 'til I got the green focus confirmation square - and after doing this on myriad occasions, still I had blurry shots on the faces I was focusing on. By then, the kids all run off because they're not interested in waiting forever. It's even worse on low light situations such as museums where you're not supposed to use flash. I had to delete many photos of my daughter that were one of a kind in front of some exhibits she just had to be photographed with. When you're with a tour group being rushed, you have no second chances. . .The blurryness is the worst of it, but I also don't like the way you have to go into a menu to switch to video mode. You can't just use a hard switch, and get there like all other cameras I have. I'm constantly switching from video to still mode when I'm photographing my children, and it's a drag to pull up a menu every single time I want to do that.Just buy a Canon. Don't spare the expense for an easy to use camera that you can trust.!!!UPDATED 7/3/09 Opinion: Raise it to about 4 stars, but with qualifiers.I just spent about 4-5 hours (no kidding! but i am a careful reader, and I fidget with the camera while reading) reading the manual and fiddling with the camera. There are many functions on this thing, and if you're willing to learn it, it's well worth the money I paid for it. Still getting some blurry shots often, but I'm confident I can do better with the features I've since learned. While reading the manual, I found a \"Green Mode\" for supposed foolproof shooting. I found a focus area selection which allows me to do spot focusing, which means I should have less false targets, and blurryness.I found cute border frames online (about 100 designs) that you can photoshop your childrens' faces into. You have to upload them from the Pentax site, but then you can plug them into your onboard camera memory to adjust and edit on the camera. Basically, you can photoshop your kids face to have dog ears on it, or put it into a cute heart border.There is a sharpness adjustment somewhere on the firmware, but I don't know if that's where my blurriness is coming from. With all the onboard features, I'm sure I can somehow make this camera work for me.Canon still rocks out of the box, but this Pentax can give a lot of satisfaction if you are a manual reader. (Maybe I should read the Canon Manuals I have some day, I might be surprised what I can do with them other than getting easy, clear pictures. Forgive me for resisting learning anything new, I'm feeling too old to do anything other than press the shutter button these days.)", "Date": "May 22, 2009"}, {"Title": "Pentax Optio A40", "Author": "F.

I needed a smaller camera to carry in my purse for quick shots of the kids. As you can see I am a loyal Canon fan. After researching cameras and reading numerous reviews I came accross this Pentax. The reviews were mostly positive and the price was in my price range. I took a chance and ordered it. I could not be happier. The size is just right to carry in my pocket or bag. Although some might find it harder to hold being it is very small (about the size of a credit card only thicker, of course!) The darn little camera has too many choices and my husband thinks it is smarter than use both. I only received it yesterday so I do have a lot of reading to do. The manual is only in English (a plus for me) and is about an inch thick. You can edit your pics straight from the camera. I really need to play with it a while more before I can give a better review. So far its great!The only cons I have are:the rechargeable battery. As I like to just grab batteries and go. I must now remember to charge this one up. Probably not a problem for most I would assume. And the fact that it has so many options, it is going to take me awhile to learn all its features correctly.

The camera is incredibly easy to operate and the automatic mode selection works quite well.  The pictures it takes are great as long as there is adequate light. They are very colorful and it is rare that they turn out blurry unless it is in the dark.The camera is light weight and easily fits in the pocket of my jeans.

I took it with me to Hawaii on several hikes and even took the camera on a 'cave tubing' trip.  I took it inside a plastic bag as it is obviously not waterproof. The camera did end up getting a little wet and the inside of the bag was damp, but the camera functioned no problem and has worked fine for over 6 months after.The only real drawbacks I have to say the camera has are that it takes lousy pictures in the dark and that the flash sometimes takes an excessive amount of time to charge.", "Date": "December 20, 2009"}, {"Title": "Pentax Optio", "Author": "Retired Maven", "ReviewID": "RM2RJAJPYI7P1", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Excellent camera.
