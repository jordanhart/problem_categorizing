Their design, performance, and quality is hard to match. Now onto the camera:I have shot around 4-5 Gigs worth of photos in various settings, so I have a good idea of what this camera has to offer. The features itself within the camera are excellent. Aside from increased megapixels, it's not much different than the SD700 except for some odd reason, Canon decided to opt out of the IS (Image Stabilization) feature. I almost gave it 4 stars based solely on that aspect. But other than that, the camera is brilliant.For portraits and close-ups, the Face Detection feature is phenomenal which is a reflection of the new DIGIC III technology. The camera will lock in on the human face or multiple faces (I've locked in up to 8) and keep it in focus no matter where you move or pan the camera. And if you're shooting indoors or in low-light, the ISO can be set as high as 1600 so you have a lot of Flash Exposure control if you don't like that spotlight look when using the flash. There is also an Auto ISO setting which gives the user a lot of range to shoot. It will determine proper ISO setting and shutter speed and also will predict camera shake resulting in less blurry pictures. I guess this makes up for not having IS. :)If you are a novice photographer and don't like to mess with ISO, aperture settings, and shutter speed variations this camera will fit your needs just fine. It has 17 shooting modes including \"scene\" modes for the different settings you may be shooting in such as the beach, fireworks, snow, portraits, night, etc. Fully automatic so any beginner can pick up this camera and shoot like a pro.The most popular feature has to be the 3\" LCD screen. It's ginormous. But in order to get that big of a screen on such a compact camera, Canon forgoes the optical viewfinder. So if you're a viewfinder shooter, then you may not like the fact you are limited to just the LCD screen for image framing.One shortcoming of the camera is that it still has a weak zoom. 3X optical is nothing and so the zoom feature is pretty much non-existent.The movie features on the camera are awesome. i like the Time Lapse movies where you can record time lapse of up to 2 hours and condense it into a 4 or 8 minute movie. So if you want to make that cool \"cloud moving\" effect or the \"budding flower\" you can accomplish that with this camera. The video resolution is excellent and has a VGA frame rate of 30fps.Overall, the camera satisfies all users with being simple enough to use for beginners and also boasting features a professional can appreciate. It also looks bitchin and has a two tone effect that people admire. The corners are intelligently rounded so it slips easily in and out of any pocket you may want to put it in.", "Date": "April 4, 2007"}, {"Title": "Outstanding images.... isn't that what we all want??  Here you go!", "Author": "C. Stevens \"Housephile\"", "ReviewID": "R35CRYUR9FYIAT", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I just received the SD750 for my birthday (thanks Mom & Dad!).  I've had it for several days and have taken over 3 hundred pictures and tons of video.  It now replaces my old Canon S400, which was a replacement for my antique Canon S110.  I've remained true to Canon because I can see the amount of work they have put into making each new generation of cameras \"that much better.\"  First, the colors are so much crisper on the SD750 than in prior models, although some tweeking may be needed, you can always find a setting to capture the color you are after.  Second, the video quality is outstanding (at the highest setting, that is), and Canon finally took off the 3 minute cap to video recording to allow for longer videos.  Also, at the highest setting only, you can zoom in and out while recording video.  I love the 3 inch display that incorporates a shifting orientation so the picture is always upright.  I do wish that the camera came with a more powerful optical zoom... but I imagine I'll get that with the next generation.  And in the end, I have to emphasize, that this camera takes OUSTANDING pictures.  That's what a camera should do, after all.  Now for a quick rundown of improvements from previous models (for you Canon loyalists):- Much improved color- Faster picture taking and faster everything- Extended video capacity (to however much memory ya got)- Large LCD to appease the instant gratification generation- Overall improved picture quality (clarity, color saturation)A few small camera quirks outside of picture quality... the jog dial in back (trying to emulate iPod) is not the smartest addition and the \"play\" button is a little hard to hit at times.  Overall, I definitely without hesitation recommend this camera.", "Date": "April 18, 2007"}, {"Title": "Good until it broke: the dreaded \"Lens Error\"", "Author": "A.

I don't think I did anything to cause this, though it was in the bento box on my bike and might have tried to turn on in there, getting the lens stuck.

I was debating on SD750 or Sony T-100.  I finally purchased SD750 while my friend purchased the T100.  Few days of playing with the SD750 and a quick look at the T100, Im happy with my decision.First, let me say if you are not going to use all the functions on the camera, you cant' really go wrong with either one of them.  Dependable and works fine in most situations.Design, I think the T-100 looks more attractive, but after that I believe SD750 is better.LCD Screen. both have 3inch LCD, but Canon has less glare and is more vivid.  both gets fuzzy in low light situations, but lcd picture isnt what you get when u print.Stability. T-100 has image stabilization to compensate for slower shutter speed. which helps, but i still like Canon's performance. It just takes better pictures on a constant basis.  Canon seems to take better pictures in low light (indoor or dim light)ZOOM.  T100 has 5X and SD750 has 3X. to me zoom on a PNS has no meaning, because 90% of the time you arent taking a photo far away.Battery. Both suck up battery quickly. but the T-100 seems to last longer than the SD750.  I just bought another batter pack to compensate for short battery life.  Sony Powershot T-100 on the down side. Takes something like 5 hours to fully Charge, while SD750 only takes me 1.5 hours.Options. I think they have about the same amount of functions. IE portrait, macro, and what not. Although i havent read the T100 manual.Video. Both take great video.  But i think t-100 has a HD version. I like Canons because u can directly connect your camera to OP source and play it. I dont think T100 had that ability.RECOMMENDATIONS.  Buy a SDHC (SD-high capacity) Card. with Class rating of 4 or better (3 class speeds, 2 4 6, determines how fast u write and read info on the card)  I take video clips and do Continious photos alot. which means i fill up memory space fast, and Need a card that can keep up with the demand.  Get atleast a 4gig SDHC card.  Both cameras are able to read the new SDHC cards.Extra battery for 8 bucks on e bay for SD750 is a good idea.Overall, canon is a better bang for your buck.  Cheaper, and the performance is equal or better than the SONY. but if you wanna show off to your friends, get the SONY, but if u want all around pictures get the SD750", "Date": "August 1, 2007"}, {"Title": "Great little camera in the SD series. Better than the SD1000 overall at the new lower price.", "Author": "AmazonDiva \"Keep Calm and Carry On.\"", "ReviewID": "R1X9S4J00365RP", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Having used the SD1000 and the SD750 together for the same shots I can say that the SD750 offers more especially as there was no price difference on the day I purchased the SD750 (both were around 167 bucks). Earlier with the more than 50 bucks price difference I had recommended the SD1000 for price/value. At the new lower price the SD750 is the winner.Neither model has the new Image Stabilization, which does not work so well on the SD series anyway when compared to other Canon cameras like S5. The SD750 has a 3\" screen which makes shots easy to compose and view, while the SD1000 has a viewfinder with a 2.5\" screen. Having used both cameras I'd take the larger screen size over the viewfinder any day as I hardly use the viewfinder. In size the SD1000 is a little more compact but the difference is barely noticeable. The SD750 has nicely rounded corners which are more aesthetically appealing to most people.The SD750 also has a few more features in the software and better controls than the SD1000. The extra replay button at the back which lets you switch from camera to replay instantly is great. The extra Scene mode button on the top makes it faster and more convenient to get to the special modes like foliage, sunny beach, snow, portrait, nightshot, aquarium, kids and pets, fireworks and underwater. I have used all these special modes and I am very pleased with the results. Canon has really optimized the performance on each. It is so much better than fiddling with the manual controls while you lose the shot. If you read the manual carefully, you will get so much more out of this camera as it lets you get very creative with panoramic landscape shots, color swapping, color accent and different color modes.The pictures from both cameras were comparable, both take excellent shots outdoors and don't have the best low light performance.I also own a SD870 which has a wide angle lens and Image Stabilization. The software and all other features on the 870 are the same as 750, but the 870 costs much more. Although I like the 870 too, but I think the 750 delivers a great value for its current price.This is the one I would buy as a gift. Very compact, good performance and intuitive controls that allow you to get creative in your shots.", "Date": "March 11, 2008"}, {"Title": "Great camera, easy to use.", "Author": "M.

I waited for the latest Canons to arrive and did a ton of research on different models before my trip. You can't go wrong with this little guy. It's compact, big 3\" screen, great Video capture, lot's of great presets, and a pretty easy to figure out features. I have only two complaints about this camera. No image stabilization, No icon to show you how low your battery is. If you buy this camera, make sure you get an extra battery, and at least a 4GB memory card, I highly recommend the Extreme Sandisk brand. If you want quick and reliable photos don't go cheap on memory cards.

Haviland Jr. \"AirshowFan\"", "ReviewID": "R2CJQIVYC6KRBD", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I shoot primarily with digital SLRs, but there is always a time when you don't have your camera bag with you and there is a photo opportunity. Camera phones just don't cut the cake for this (yet). For the last four years, I used a Powershot S230, and it filled that purpose wonderfully but the 3\" screen on the SD750 called me in like the Sirens of mythology. In general, I have been very satisfied with the SD750, but there have been a few items I did not like.Let me start with the positives: The 3\" screen is bright and sharp. Everyone who sees the camera loves it. The face detection software works great. For taking photos of family and friends, this will be the point and shoot camera you will want to have. The price is reasonable. TIP: Don't compare cameras by simply the megapixel size! Two things create sharp photographs. The camera sensor, and the quality of the lens. With the Canon SD750, both of these are the best quality you can find in a small camera. The SD750 takes decent videos as well. The menu system is easy to navigate.Now for the negatives: There is a price to pay for the large preview screen. Battery life is low. With five minutes of video, I was only able to shoot 200 still images before I had a low battery warning. You will want to invest in a spare battery. Digital zoom in the video mode is terrible. Be careful not to go beyond the 3x optical range when using this feature. As others have noted, the on/off button is small and recessed and requires a fingernail to operate. Results with this camera have been inconsistent. While I have taken some nice portraits, some shots have demonstrated a tendency towards soft focus. I have the silver model. Some reviewers have said that this is not the case with the black model, so you may want to stick with that. There is no image stabilization on this camera. If you don't have a steady hand, you may want to get a camera that has that feature.", "Date": "September 24, 2007"}, {"Title": "Nearly Perfect", "Author": "Jeremy Davidson \"jernmo\"", "ReviewID": "R2ZTIDASCZOPFT", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I purchased this product after doing quite a bit of research.

The start-up time and time to take a picture is extremely fast and accurate.

It includes technology that is supposed to base the focus using facial recognition software. I was a little skeptical as to how well this would work, but I am very pleased indeed! The lens extends quickly when it is turned on, it zooms in and out quickly, and the lens retracts quickly when it is turned off.

I have used many Canon cameras in the past, from my first A20, to an S80, to a S3 IS, and finally to a Rebel XT.The main reason I chose the SD750 is the 3 inch LCD.  I originally saw the sd630 at a party and I was impressed by the size of the 3 inch LCD screen. I decided then that if I ever get another snapshot camera, it had to have a 3 inch LCD.  It just makes framing and playback so much more pleasant.When actually using the LCD viewfinder, I found the realtime \"viewfinder\" image somewhat course.  My guess is that they had to lower the image quality to get a decent frame rate on the viewfinder.  HOWEVER, the lower image quality is only found in viewfinder mode, the actual image in playbacks or reviewing movies/images on the 3inch LCD is far more crisp.Initially there was a bit of confusion over the sd750 and the sd1000, afterall the higher number of sd1000 should be a better camera right?  Well, not so in this case... the sd1000 just has a slightly smaller body and smaller lcd, internals are for the most part, the same.Images taken by this camera are excellent for a compact camera.  I shot in indoor lighting with and without flash, images are excellent.  Word of warning though,  since this is a snapshooter, 8 times out of 10 this camera WILL be flashing your subjects in indoor environments. If you turn off the flash and find a stable base to take pictures, this camera can take some very nice flashless images. The white balance in indoor light can be off a little bit at times, but it is not so much as to ruin the picture. In fact, I got some interesting light effect from it.I found that the camera interface is slightly less intuitive than previous models that I have used.  Buttons tend to have multiple functions, I had to take a quick look at the manual to find some functions.  But once I knew where they were it was quite easy to change settings.I also prefer the squarer body over the more rounded body of other sd models like the SD900.  I am always afraid that the sd900 body will just slip out of my fingers.  The sd750 however is a little more secure to grip due to its flat sides.", "Date": "June 14, 2007"}, {"Title": "Great Upgrade from the SD200", "Author": "Jeff M.", "ReviewID": "R26SL1V3DFJ1MY", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Every few years I accept the fact that there has been enough technological advancements in digital photography to buck for a new Canon Elph. My previous Canon SD200 was a pure tank, it took great photos and survived college parties, a trip to India, and and 6 foot crowd surfing tumble at a concert!With that said, I narrowed my selections to the signature/retro Eplh looking SD1000 and the contoured new look of the SD750. Well, when Dell put the SD750 on sale for $239.20 (5/26/07, still available) my decision was made. Here are some major upgrades I noticed from my SD200.-Screen is much brighter, clearer, and larger. HUGE Improvement in overall quality of this. Took out the old school 'viewfinder' hole to make room for the larger screen...no problem with me! Pure LCD screen for sure.-Digic III Processor is much faster than the Digic II. From starting the camera to wait time before the next shot, the SD750 runs laps around my SD200.-Features: In addition to Marco/Normal options, there is now an 'Infinity' option that lets you grab shots from far away. Digital zoom is up to 12x, as good as any ultra-compact out there. 7.1 MegaPixels, why would any amateur need any more?! I've been messing around with the 'Time Lapse' capture....AMAZING! This is a cool feature that will be awesome for sunsets.-My biggest CON is the playback button placement. Instead of having it with the rest of the photo/video buttons, they put a tiny button on the back of the camera by itself. This will be very confusing for a lot of new users trying to use this camera.Aside from that, I've been blown away by the power and speed of this camera. Pictures are much clearer, there are plenty of manual options that should keep me busy for awhile.

I fell in love with it instantly and began looking for one. During my search, I discovered that the SD750 was about to be released. So I waited. I just got it less than 24 hours ago and I am not disappointed! The 3 inch LCD is GREAT! It works well even on a sunny day. I have to admit that getting my fingerprints all over it regularly is driving me crazy but it cleans up easily with a lense cleaning cloth. The camera takes dynamite pictures and I love the macro mode. The camera is fast too, much faster than my old four year old model. It starts up fast, shoots fast, and stores fast. I shot some pictures at dusk last night and found that the camera does well in low light as well.One thing that worries me is the little flap that covers the USB connector. Maybe it's just me, but I feel like I am going to break it. Instead of using the USB cable, I will go buy a memory card reader to download the pictures.Other than that little detail, I love the camera so far.

The camera is very compact but I never had problems to get a good grip and a steady hand. The images have excellent true color and are indeed sharp. I would definetely recommend an accessory kit for this camera which includes a nice small leather case and an extra original Canon battery and its available on Amazon. The accessory kit turns out to be cheaper than buying the individual components and its contains original Canon parts especially the extra battery. Also get a SD card with large enough memory.

Maybe the only negative is that you will forget you have it with you. Perhaps you could throw it in the wash with your trousers? That worries me.One caution.  This beautiful camera is so light and so small that it is very easily dropped since you forget you are holding it. Do use the handstrap! I dropped mine the very first day, and my heart sank as I watched it fly across a marble floor. It emerged totally undamaged, but I learned my lesson.After buying two leather cases, both of which ended up seeming too big, I found a very nice and cheap \"Travel Blue\" brand IPOD type case made of that \"wet suit\" material.

Wow, it is very nice design of the body, slimmer than SD500.  Huge 3\" LCD screen, color display on screen is near original(Not just my feel, also few other friends said so).  Use the dial technology similiar to the iPod's dial to switch the shoot modes, but you may take some time to get used to it. 3x optical 35-105mm zoom is better than SD500, but I wish it can go wider to 28mm like SD800 IS. SD750 has DIGIC III processor.  Can use SDHC card but I hear it may cause bottleneck, so I continue using the 2GB highspeed to hold over 600 pics in highest setting.  Movie shooting is great even inside the restaurant at night time.  It can also record your voice to each picture.  Battary life is not as good as SD500. But it still takes about 150 pictures in a full charge. Recommend to have a backup when you go traveling.  No complaint for the 3\" LCD.  Oh, one good feature in this camera is it has an easy button to review the pictures, press the shutter to return to shooting mode.  This is way better than SD500.  It's one of the best so far. Highly recommend if you are looking for a compact, easy-use camera that take quality pictures.  Good luck.Added: This is just on my own preference, I have the silver version.  I like this version better than the black version, unless Canon makes the whole camera body black.

The frst thing I noticed was the autofocus and face detection. The FD is amazing in that it can actually find and \"lock on\" to moving faces in a shot!(up to 9) The focusing time is very minimal and this camera has amazing start up time.All of the controls are easily reachable and you are able to customize some of the buttons to do a specified feature. For example, I programmed the print/share button to activate the recording mode when I'm in picture taking mode. That way, I can record a movie quickly without sliding the top toggle to movie mode! This was a bonus I didn't expect.The camera is very thin and fits about anywhere you would need it to. I really like the dual tone woth black and silver although it collects fingerprints easily, but I just wipe it off with a microfiber cloth.About all the reviews about short battery life, I found the battery to last quite a while, although not the longest I've seen. If you are on a trip, you should be able to get by with recharging a single battery every night.This thing takes beautiful pictures both indoors and out! The color in the vivid 3 inch screen is amazing and feels more true to life than any other. You can select many different sizes for your pictures and this makes printing very simple. Compatibility with pictbridge makes it compatible with almost every photo printer. It comes with an av cable which is definitely a bonus.

The Camera is really fast in terms of powering on and taking instant pictures.The cons and this is where it really hurts - pictures are not sharp, they look very grainy. The flash is not powerful enough if you take a lot of indoor snaps.  It has an awesome LCD display which compounds this problem. The pictures look great on the LCD screen but when you actually download it to your desktop you see a remarkable difference.

I bought this one originally because I needed another Canon to replace my old Canon (5.0 megapixels).

Even though I love the slim modern design and the HUGE 3\" screen, but it does NOT have a good stabilizer.  I view myself as a decent photographer since I used my other 3 (old) Canons for years and the photos ALWAYS come out very clear and sharp.  That's the MAIN reason why I stuck with Canon for so long.  (I hate Sony digital camera anyway but that's another story.)  But the SD750 was such a disappointment!!  Maybe the one I got was defective but BestBuy (where I purchase the camera from) tested it out and said it was fine.  So I ended up returning the SD750 and bought the SD850 (8.0 megapixels).  Even though it's $100 more than the SD750, but the SD850 comes with the image stabilizer.  I figure more money equals higher quality and I was right.  The SD850 is flawless!!!

This is expected from a company which specializes in cameras, others make consumer electronics and making a digital camera is just to complete their line of products.Remember:1. Most important thing in a camera is lens and in case of digital camera its lens and the CCD sensor. Canon's Digic I, II & III sensors are the best.2. Megapixels are not important after 4MP. Since anything larger than 4MP means that we can print huge posters larger that 8x10, which most people don't.3. Large MP camera mean large file sizes which mean you will have to buy a 1-2 GB SD Card, and eventually a very large hard disk to store these pictures. This camera at 7.1 MP makes pictures files of 2.5 to 3 Megabytes.This is an excellent camera for only those people who are looking for a small and light camera, people who just want to point and shoot and don't care much about other details.Some of the Pros and Cons:Pros:- Small and light- Good picture quality in well lit areas (sunlight, indoors daytime)- Excellent video quality. They look really great on YouTube.- Large LCD screen, but large means less battery life. However, enough for 150-200 pictures between recharges.- Can print dates on pictures, but at a lower resolution.Cons:- Not very feature rich.- Not much manual setting.- Not so good picture quality in low light.But again these cons are there because it was designed for amateurs to point and shoot.Bottomline is that if you are looking for a light, point and shoot camera then this is a 5 star camera, but if are looking for more features then look for Canons Powershot A series cameras or Canon EOS SLRs.", "Date": "July 13, 2007"}, {"Title": "Awesome camera with superb pictures", "Author": "HIPPY MAC", "ReviewID": "RKFJP0H4R8TE2", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I just purchased this camera two days ago and I simply love it.

I returned the beautiful Nikon because my fingers would always end up in the pictures (a camera design flaw).Now, the SD750 is far above my expectations.

Even have one of their aps cameras laying around somewhere. This camera does not disappoint. This camera replaced my venerable A85 which finally gave up the ghost only after a severe dunking (with me too).  Battery life is great. Quick flash recharge between shots. Huge screen. I can see it even in the sun. So far, I do not miss having an optical viewfinder.  My brother has the next model up with image stabilization but only the 2.5\" screen. My advice is to save your money and go with the larger screen of the 750. I really couldn't tell a difference with the image stabilization under normal conditions.  The only negative, and not enough to knock the rating, is the battery indicator. When it goes red, you only have a few minutes of operation left. It would be nice if it had a more detailed battery level indicator. The battery does last a long time though as previously mentioned.  The software that ships with the camera is really pretty good. I too use Picasa but I tried the Canon software to do editing and printing. Very easy to use. I have not used the software to download the images as I have a card reader on my computer. I have always used card readers, the're easier in my opinion. The direct printing works well too if you have a printer that supports it. You can do some basic editing right on the camera before you print.  All in all a great LITTLE camera that I highly recommend. Don't even feel it in my pocket. It has plenty of shooting options and takes excellent photos. It takes such good videos that I sold my 5 year old mini dv camcorder. I have been experimenting with the macro mode in our sunny garden.

There really is no comparison. The extra .5 inches of LCD screen make a huge difference when it comes to taking the photos. I also noticed how much cheaper looking the SD 1000 vs. the SD 750. Hard to explain, but the SD 1000 feels a lot cheaper in your hands.I purchased the SD 750 online a week later and it was a fantastic decision. It takes amazing photos. I was often times in direct sunlight and found the LCD screen to be bright and perfect. Even at its default 5 setting for brightness. You will not miss the viewfinder when you have such a huge LCD screen to set up your shots. The huge LCD screen helped me set up the most perfect shots.One must also mention the different settings in which you can shoot, which includes specific settings for beach, indoors, night snapshots, fireworks, kids and pets, foliage, and others. I tested out a bunch of these settings because i was in different environments and I couldn't be happier with the results. Plus, the camera is very very small and slim, so throw it in a case, and you are good to go. I often had it in my pocket with its case, or i would happily carry it around with me.I do strongly recommend purchasing the following accessories to really get the most out of the camera:1. Obviously you need a memory card because the one it comes with holds few pictures. I purchased a SanDisk Ultra 2 GB card. Holds a ton of photos and is extremely fast.2. You of course must get a case to protect your investment. I went with the PSC-55 Canon Leather case. It's strong, looks sleek, and not bulky. Everything you want in a case.3. Purchase a backup rechargeable battery. Trust me on this. The one little flaw with this camera is that when the battery is low, you won't know until an icon appears just as the battery is about to die. You should always have a backup battery with you just in case. A Canon NB 4L battery is a bit pricey. I recommend getting a generic version for a third of the price.4. Lastly: Back up your investment in a digital camera with a warranty. I myself never purchase warranties for items, but with a digital camera being so hands on, and the potential for it to break, I think it is well worth the extra money. I purchased a Mack Warranty, and I have real peace of mind nothing that if something breaks without my doing, it can be fixed for free.If you want great photos and a compact camera, without getting over the $350 price range, this camera is the best!(Side note: I got the black version.

Neither of us has ever owned a Canon before, so I based my decision to buy from reviews and a friend's recommendation.  Now that it has arrived I can happily confirm that picture quality and function are outstanding.  The lack of image stabilization hasn't been a problem at all and despite the negative comments on zoom we find 3x more than adequate for the type of pictures we take.  The only negative comment I have is that the battery has to be removed from the camera each time it needs to be recharged.  This is a big inconvenience to us and I have to believe a detriment to camera longevity due to the wear and tear each time the battery is pulled from the contacts.  For all I know, this may be a common characteristic of Canon digital compacts, but we were shocked because all the other digital camera's we've owned including an old Sony and a couple of Fuji compacts all charge the battery internally.

I was a little worried about not being able to see the screen in bright sunlight, but i live in south carolina and i could see it pretty good ( a little lighter but not enought to trade in the big lcd for a viewfinder.)Unlike the previous model (some complaints about the red eyes) the red eye reduction works perfect and if somehow you do end up with red eyes, there is a red eye removal tool. The pictures are clear and sharp in auto, sometimes in other modes like color accent or swap, they will be a little blurry or in macro, but if you read the book that came with the camera and play with it a little bit you will find the best settings and wont get any blurs. ex: i set my camera on high iso and turn off flash in macro. like most camera you need to read the book that came with it and you can achieve beautiful pictures.

James Riggs", "ReviewID": "R1B8V08H4MGNLB", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "1. Because it's made by Canon, and since they are a world leader in optics technology and have been making high quality cameras for 60 years, you can be sure they know what they are doing (and they do).2. Because it's one of, if not the best, cameras you can find in it's category and price range and seriously, I looked around and fussed about cameras for months before I finally bought this one.3. Because you can just slip this elegant little marvel of technology in your shirt pocket or jeans and go to that party and snap you and your friends making memories of yourselves with the slightest of ease. No heavy, bulky, protruding, swinging equipment to lug around or worry about. No potentially embarrassing bulges. It's just that comfortable to take with you anywhere.4. Because the image quality of this camera would satisfy most professionals in most ordinary situations, never mind the average user...who is just going to end up taking normal, point and shoot shots of friends/ family/house/apartment/dog/car 90% of the time anyway. Even though it's not completely manual (shutter speed and aperture control would be nice...hint, hint Canon) it does have plenty of functions you can play with (like a black & white mode and more). Remember: the most important part of any camera is the lens and this one is top notch, so no worries. Anyway taking clever, cool, artsy pictures has almost nothing to do with the camera (you can do that with a box, a pinhole, and some film) so freaking out over megapixels is mostly useless unless you're really going to blow up living-room size prints of that birthday cake. The 7.1 megapixels that this baby has is way more than most snappers will ever need or use. Video is surprisingly good and honestly something I really didn't expect in a fairly low priced camera.5. Because the huge 3 inch LCD screen is super-cool and that's what tipped the balance for me between this camera and all the other Elphs (no regrets). Believe me, all your friends and relatives are going to be ooohing and awwwing over it. The display even moves as you tilt it to accommodate those full-body vertical shots (everybody, and I mean everybody, comments on that little super-attention-to-detail feature).The only negatives I can find after 3 months of using this camera (thought I worked for Canon didn't ya?) is that the flash lag (the amount of time it takes for the flash to go off in low-light situations after you press the shutter) is a tad longer than I like (about 1 to 2 seconds longer than desirable) and the red-eye reduction doesn't seem to do the job it's supposed to very well (although you can fix red-eye right in the camera).

I would hold the camera totally still (even with arms stabilized and holding my breath), and take a photo of still people, and the picture was blurry.

I bought mine as a more convenient \"backup\" for a DSLR (the Canon 30D).  It replaces the Canon PowerShot S80, which I loved until the day I gave it to my girlfriend.First, the not so bad.  The SD750 is lacking some of the features that I loved in the S80.  As a serious hobbyist, I really want the maximum of manual control for my camera, and i try to avoid the programmed modes.  Unfortunately, the SD750 does not allow me to fully control exposure or some other settings.This lack of control is probably a strong point for the casual shooter, though.  It is also very useful for me, because it fits neatly in a jeans or shirt pocket, and can be carried places where a larger SLR camera would not be convenient.  The S80, while more full-featured (and with higher resolution), was just a little too big for this kind of thing.  The SD750, on the other hand, goes nearly everywhere with me.The camera has a fantastic, bright, and huge LCD screen.  Aside from its physical aspects, it has the same amazing color reproduction that the Canon digital line is known for.  It produces decent images in low-light situations, provided you use a tripod, monopod, or some other mechanism to brace it (as well as the shutter timer) to minimize the shake from the shutter release.This camera only gets 4 stars from me because it (a) lacks IS; (b) has 1 megapixel lower resolution; and (c) does not have full manual or aperture priority modes.", "Date": "June 26, 2007"}, {"Title": "not satisfied at all", "Author": "R.

The image quality is fantastic and the modes on the camera are second to none. The real reason you want this camera isn't just for it's great screen, modes, or image quality.  No, you want this camera for the capability hidden within. With a little tweaking (and unfortunately, a possible warranty-voiding) you can unlock features of your camera that put it on par with the highest quality cameras available. With a third-party firmware package that can be used without replacing the stock firmware (meaning, without the possibility of permanently damaging the camera), you can record in a much higher quality file format. Not only this, but you can increase the aperture rate options tenfold, allowing you to take pictures of something as fast as a water droplet hitting a surface, or lightening. With a tripod and a script, one can even set it up to automatically take a picture when movement is detected.  This camera has a lot of capabilities that the average user has no use for, and all the stock options are more than enough for most photographers, making this camera one of the best for nearly every market. With it's small size, high quality images, high usability, and extended features, I believe this camera is well worth the money. I personally keep a copy of the CHDK firmware on all my SD cards, so if I ever want to take pictures with any of the options available to me there, it's always ready.

Sure the Kodak was simple and easy.. but this camera has more advanced options and if you're not an idiot I'm sure you can figure out how to use them.  But even if you don't use the advanced options, the camera takes great pictures.  I don't know why some people are saying that the pics are blurry because I havnt found that at all.  The color in the pictures is especially vibrant.  I also like that the lens goes in and out very quickly when you turn on/off the camera.  It also looks really nice with a big screen.  I was concerned that this model does not have the Image Stabilization feature that is now on cameras, but I really dont find that to be a problem so far.  My last camera didn't have Image Stabilization and I'm not a professional photographer so I'm not sure that it makes that much of a difference for someone like me.

Everything fits purposefully and efficiently in the box.  It makes an excellent travel case that protects the camera during trips by preventing the contents from moving around during transit.Camera Quality<< 10/10*I was taken aback at the pure quality that the SD750 exudes.  The camera feels great in your hand, and solid as well.  I felt bad getting finger prints on it!  Good thing the smudges come off with a soft microfiber towel.  The camera is made in Japan, which is great.  Something about a Japanese-made product.  Only German-made products feel as solid.  The tolerances of the camera are excellent.  Meticulous attention to detail was paid to the design, with no sharp edges present.Camera Ease of Use<< 10/10*The SD750 is flat-out easy to use.  Controls are intuitive and very easy to understand, even without looking at the manual.  The buttons feel solid, and reassure the user of his/her intentions with a small \"beep\" with each press.  The zoom is smooth, and the massive 3-inch LCD is very clear and a pleasure to use.  No viewfinder is offered, but in my opinion, you don't need it.Camera Ergonomics<< 10/10*The Canon SD750 fits in your pocket perfectly.  You won't even know it's there, quite honestly.  It's slightly larger than your run-of-the-mill cell phone (LG 400U).  It also has smooth edges, so it slips in/out of your pocket easily, with no buttons or dials protruding.  Fantastic design.  The camera's zoom closes flush with the camera body.Camera Performance<< Rating 9/10*No Image Stabilization, no problem.  Make no mistake about it--if you are a clutz, opt for the SD870IS.

Life never gives you a second chance to capture a specific moment in time.  I also use the SD750 when I attend parties.  I don't like the attention that my Canon 40D gets, so the SD750 is a welcomed addition to my arsenal.  The SD750 has anything you would want in an ultra-compact camera.

Mets Games).  I've taken 2-3 GB's of photos/videos under various settings and have had it for one month.I was torn between this and the Canon A720IS.  The A720IS is better in that it has Image Stabilization (IS) and a 6x optical zoom (SD750 = 3x OZ), however, is much bulkier and uses AA batteries.  Both are at excellent price points.  Ultimately, I went with the SD750 because of it's 3\" lcd, excellent battery life and compact design.PRO's:+ 3\" LCD Screen- I have never used an optical viewfinder and see no purpose in it.  As such, I'm glad Canon did away with it and replaced the space with a large LCD screen.  The screen is bright, sharp and is easy to see in bright light conditions.+ Compact Design- This is a tiny camera that can easily fit in one's pocket, but large and sturdy enough to feel solid when holding it.  At this point in my life, a camera I can take anywhere is more important than a camera that can take professional quality photos.+ Excellent Photo Quality- This camera takes excellent large photos under almost any condition, especially low light settings.  The in-camera MY COLORS software is impressive, not just a gimmick.  I use it in almost every picture I take, whether I want to emphasize one specific color or shoot a B&W; picture and illuminate just one color.  However, the \"Color Swap\" feature is useless.+ Price Point- At $160, this camera is a tremendous value.  Canon packs a lot into this package and SD memory cards are dirt cheap when compared to Sony's memory sticks.+ Speed- Turns on and takes pictures within 2-3 seconds.+ My Colors- The VIVID feature which accentuates a specific color in a photo (ie. a blue ocean or green grass) is solid and something you will use a lot.+ Stitch Assist- The stitch assist software is a little elementary but does help create some incredible panoramics.  Suggestion: take a few panoramic shots of your target because the pc software may butcher the stitching.CON's:- Flash too strong- Portrait shots taken in low light (ie. at a bar) can come out too bright because of the flash.  Adjustments can be made to compensate.- 3x Optical Zoom- Could use a stronger optical zoom, 3x is useless.- Color Swap- MY COLORS is an amazing in-camera software set, but the Solor Swap feature within My Colors just doesn't work as well as advertised.Bottom Line: With an excellent price point, great photos, large LCD screen, and compact size, the Canon SD 750 is a solid buy from a company that has dominated this end of the market.

They both have the same 7.1 Megapixel sensor and similar lenses. However the SD750 has way less detail and much more problems with low light. I have set up both cameras on the same exact manual settings and shot the same objects, only to find that my new camera is much worse.You will typically notice the lack of detail when using the flash or in low light.

Amazon shipped it quickly (received within 1 week).  The camera has a really nice large LCD screen in the back.  I love the two toned look (silver in the front and black in the black).  It has so many options if you dig deeper and read the manual.  It can do pretty much everything I can do on my Canon xti DSLR.  It has automatic settings for the casual photographer and lots of advanced settings for those of us who like more control over our photos.  The only thing is, I really wish there was a viewfinder.  Sometimes the sun is so bright it gets hard to see the screen.", "Date": "April 25, 2008"}, {"Title": "Great little camera", "Author": "Review Man \"Review Man\"", "ReviewID": "R1HLJKO4H824V2", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Ultra compact cameras like this one don't take pictures as nice as SLRs, but the best camera is the one that you use and not the one that sits at home.  And with the size and weight of this Canon you'll use it everywhere.  Another huge consideration is LCD size.  Despite its small size the SD750 has a 3-inch LCD which is bright and crisp.  The size difference over a 2.5-inch LCD is a lot more than it sounds like because it's measured diagonally.  Definitely get a big LCD no matter what camera you buy.As for photo quality, the SD750 is better than any other compact digital I've seen.  In full automatic mode under the right conditions (good light, stationary subjects, etc.) the photos are outstanding.  In less than perfect conditions if you want great shots you'll be well served to learn the controls and particularly the numerous scene modes.  My indoor shots in moderate light were coming out overexposed in the foreground and dark in the background, but once I started using the Indoor mode those shots looked great.  The Cloudy mode really helps bring out the colors in outdoor shots on cloudy days (as intended).  Take a little time to learn scene modes and other settings like High ISO and the different types of autofocus and you'll get much more out of this camera than if you just use full auto all the time.As for special features, there are more on this camera than I would ever use.  Color swap modes, red eye reduction, slide shows and all kinds of stuff I'm sure I'll never touch.  I just want to take good pictures.  If I want to edit my pictures I'll do it on my computer and not in the camera.  But if that's your thing you'll be kept busy for a long time playing around with all the stuff the SD750 has to offer.Finally, a great thing about the SD750 is the SPEED.  It's much faster starting up and taking shots than any other digital camera I've used.  From pressing the ON button to being ready to shoot takes less than a second.  Master the art of pre-focusing your shot by pressing the shutter button halfway and then framing your shot after it's focused and you'll virtually eliminate all shutter lag.  And oh yeah, the battery lasts a long time, though it would be nice if there was a battery indicator to tell you how much charge is left.", "Date": "April 21, 2008"}, {"Title": "Best digicam with Large LCD", "Author": "Manish", "ReviewID": "RWI7BH89R85VY", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I bought this digicam and used it for a while now.

Given that it's intended to be an ultra-compact, point-and-shoot type of camera, one should judge with this in mind. In this category, it does the job quite nicely. For outdoor, well-lit scenes, the SD750 will deliver quality pictures. But it tends to get grainy and wobbly when shooting dim interiors.I traveled to Italy last year and wanted something that would fit easily into my pocket and not weigh me down while walking through catacombs and ruins. For that purpose, this little camera was a champ. Shots of the Roman Forum, Colosseum, and exteriors of the basilicas came out excellent. But nearly every one of the interior views was choppy, due to the camera's lack of image stabilization. I didn't place too high of a priority on this feature...but in retrospect, it really does make a world of difference. My friend went with the Panasonic Lumix DMC-FZ18S instead and while it was a klunkier beast to carry around, his interior shots swept mine aside with no trouble.But again, the SD750 has its niche and it does well there.

I read hundreds of reviews on many cameras from many different web sites before buying this camera.  It had the highest, most consistent ratings of any point and shoot camera I could find (and I've been looking for 2 years, no kidding).  I'm so glad I waited to get this one.  I'm definitely not a \"techy\" and have never used this camera to download pics to my computer.  I have purely used this for pics of kids, sports, pets, parties, etc and have taken indoor and outdoor pics.  All my pics have been fantastic.  I've never adjusted any settings and have only developed pics at Walmart, but I can't say enough about it.  When people see pics I've taken, they all want to know what kind of camera I have.  A few people have complained about the size of the camera being so small and the screen so big.  I have to admit that at first it was a little intimidating,(my last camera was a 35mm)and because I bought it online and had never actually held it.  After only a few uses though, that worry quickly went away.  I feel very comfortable now, plus I love the fact that it just fits into my front pocket!  Some people also complained that there was no battery meter to tell you when it was getting low.  This has never been an issue for me.  I took hundreds of pics on one charge (practically impossible with AA batteries)and there is a signal that comes on a couple of minutes before the battery dies.  Plus, I love the fact that it comes with its own rechargable battery and charger.  At this point, I can't think of any negatives to mention, and I've had it for 7 months.

So, I bought this camera and have taken it on two trips and it no longer works. When the camera is turned on there is a blank screen. The lens extends but then does not retract when the power button is pushed. The guy at the camera shops says that these are probably two separate problems. Finally got the lens back in and called canon today. We are sending the camera back to them (more expense) and are hoping they will replace it since it is less than three months old.

While I wasn't particularly pleased to see a new camera in his hands and on my dime, I must say that the images he showed me on the on the 3\" LCD screen really got my attention: bright, sharp, and clear, with excellent color.  Those images came out just the same on both my PC and my Mac Cinema screen, and I liked them so much, I bought the very same camera myself in July, 2007.Since then, I've had a great time with this little gadget, snapping thousands of photos and learning the literally dozens of features the SD750 sports.  The things you can do with it when it's in the manual (or other, non-automatic modes) are amazing and fun, and I've learned a lot about photography and digital photography as I've enjoyed the camera.I would make a couple of comments about the product and then pose the question that's the title of this posting:1) The product manual can be helpful, but I found that reading it at the outset was only marginally useful (much to the amusement of my son).  I'd say  fiddle with camera on your own (yes, as my son had told me at the outset!) and make special use of the \"Function/Set\" button to get you started into the camera's workings - THEN go back to the manual and start reading; the book will make a lot more sense that way.2. The camera's lens is a good little lens overall, but the one shortcoming I noticed over time is that it's got a low luminosity/f stop rating of only f/2.8, and this makes for lots/lots of noise in low light, non-flash photo situations.  I think Canon could make the SD750 into a perfect little camera if they were somehow able to turn it into an f/2.2 or f/2.0 lens camera.  Don't know if this is possible, but Canon ever does this, I want to know about it and buy one!Finally, the question:  What's happened to the price??!!??  I bought this camera in July, 2007 from Amazon, and I've still got the purchase voucher which shows that I bought this very same camera for $259.99 at that time.  Usually, over time, I would think that the same camera would become cheaper as newer products go on sale, but instead the price has gone UP by over 50%.

My previous Canon SD400 took tack sharp pictures in almost all situations, it was difficult to not take a good picture. With this camera, I am constantly getting out of focus, blurry shots.

This is my 4th Powershot and I am not disappointed whatsoever.The screen is really bright and big... the extra .5 inch that makes it 3\" total is really worth it.  The startup time is less than a second making it ideal for getting that quick shot when you need to.  The size makes it one of the best cameras for hiking or just taking with you in a theme park.  It easily fits in my pocket and I almost forget it's there.The flash is really powerful for it's size and I hope you take time to experiment with the Macro settings for getting real close-ups.  There are a lot of modes you can play with on the camera... so it's not just a point and shoot!  I use the macro mode all the time to get close-ups of people and flowers.

The lack of image stabilization was downplayed because the optical zoom was so low.  Outside and only in bright sun, it takes good, clear photos.  As the light dims, visual noise starts to creep in, and indoors at almost any light level, it  wants to use the flash.Anything larger than a shoe box will be under-illuminated by the flash leaving the photo unbearably dark.  Turn off the auto-flash to get a better shutter speed, and unless you're on a tripod, this camera will produce a very high resolution blurry picture.  Not a single indoor picture has turned out clear or even acceptable so far.  I took this camera with me to Rome, and wish I had gotten one with image stabilization when i got home.  Colors are underwhelming unless the camera is set to manual so that you can select the vivid color setting.  As a matter of fact, the only way to get close to acceptable pictures in low light is with manual settings and with a tripod.  If you have a choice, get an IS model.

The Kodak was a huge disappointment, even though it was small and cute (that'll teach me to buy for looks!). I saw some pictures taken by this Canon (ELPH PowerShot SD 750) and was impressed enough by the quality of the pictures that, after checking out some reviews, I decided to buy it. I have not been disappointed!This Canon is a little heavier than I expected but not uncomfortably so; it feels very \"solid\". It fits easily in a jacket pocket and even in the pocket of my jeans when I'm walking around. It looks nice, with a sleek all-silver front and a monochromatic all-black back. The viewfinder is large, clear, and a pleasure to use. The controls are fairly intuitive. It was a piece of cake to simply open the box, pop in the battery and SD card, and start shooting picture.The battery is a Lithium Ion battery, which I much prefer to AA batteries. With my usage, I can easily go a week or longer before I need to charge and the charge is very quick -- just a couple hours. This camera uses an SD card, which I like b/c so many of my other electronics use SD cards as well and if I fill one up, I can easily swap in a new card.Picture quality is great. I am so impressed with how quickly the camera powers up and can take a first picture. It resets after a flash quickly, too. This Canon has a great \"Continuous\" feature, which takes continuous pictures as long as the button is held down. That is so nice for getting the perfect smile when I'm trying to take pictures of 3 squirmy boys!My husband and I both bought Kodaks recently that we were horribly disappointed with. They cost us about $135 and $199. For $167 and free shipping from Amazon, this Canon has been hugely satisfying! I am so glad I bought it.

The camera was definitely compact and attractive and the LCD screen was amazing.  My problem?  First off....I've been through tech support hell.  After 4-5 months of use and 90% blurry pictures, I began the telephone trouble shooting with tech support and it was determined there was something wrong with my camera.  I also could NEVER get the camera shake warning to shut off (which many other people on there comment on so I know I'm definitely not the only one to get this warning\".  I mailed my camera to Canon to repair (a 4 month old camera, mind you!) and they promptly \"fixed it\" and sent it back to me and told me there was a defective lens issue and that it was fine.  As soon as I began to zoom again...camera shake warning again and blurry pictures.  I called a higher level of support and was told to send it back in.  Which I did.  They couldn't fix the problem and sent me a new one.  My problem now lies in the good old camera shake warning light.  It was happening again on this camera unless I focused the camera directly into the sun.  Any other lighting (and I live in a house loaded with windows and great natural light) whenever I zoom even the slightest bit...I get the camera shake.  I've messed with the ISO's, I've reset the camera to factory setting.  The stinking error picture does not turn off any time you zoom.  Even outside!  I called Canon about this yesterday and was told it was \"normal\".  I said an error message is normal?  Even when your camera book gives tips on how to correct the problem?  They assured me it was.  I just can't get past the glitches on this camera.  I've owned previous canon's and was always super happy.  To me...this camera is not what it's cracked up to be.  If you don't mind the flashing red lights always letting you know something is wrong...then perhaps this is for you.

I took good care of it, kept in in a protective case at all times and never scratched nor dropped it.  Everything was good until about 1 year and a half after purchase.  Issue #1: The on/off button stopped working.  It sucked, but I could live with it since the display button could also turn it off and on.But then shortly after, the zoom stopped working correctly.  Issue #2: It would zoom in close up, but wouldnt zoom back out again.  I would have to turn the camera off and turn it back on again to get the display back to normal.  I lived with that too because if i turned the camera off, it would go back to its original distance.But now at January 2010,three years later, issue #3: the button to shoot a picture will not work at all.  This happened out of nowhere, I still have never dropped the camera nor carried it without a protective case.  The camera will not take a picture.  I can still look at all the pictures on my SD card that I had taken in the past, but it no longer will take new pictures.  Canon says they will fix it for $100, but with good cameras at $150 now, I would rather run to Best Buy and get one of those, instead of the hassle of mailing it in, paying $100, then waiting a few weeks to get it mailed back.In the end, there were good pictures when it was working, but in my experience with this camera, it stops working well quickly.  It damages way too easily, all by itself.  I wouldnt purchase this if I were you, but if you still decide to purchase it, I would highly suggest purchasing a plan that covers it over three years.

And to those who are captain obvious, yes I lowered the flash setting to the lowest and tried many different settings.Battery pros: Charges fast especially if you have a couple to use while the others recharge.Battery cons: Sometimes the camera takes a long time to recover from flash. If it wasn't so bright, maybe it wouldn't take so forever! And I always used the Canon brand recommended.Durability: It did not last long. One day I got the \"lens error, restart camera\" message. Perhaps it was cold sensitivity?? Still a mystery to me. Most everything works fine now EXCEPT a slight whining noise a blur on the lens and which essentially renders all the photos useless.Conclusion: I will be replacing this digital camera but probably a cheaper nikon, one that lasted much longer.

Cho", "ReviewID": "R1SK0SZVEWLLLH", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I do not review many things on here but I always like to read what others have commented before I decide to buy things.  With that said I would like to say some nice things about this camera!  I originally bought this camera a few years ago after testing out one of my friends of the same model and fell in love with it. I accidentally fell into a lake with this camera in my pocket and I loved it so much I sent it to canon and got it refurbished for around a $100 bucks.  Recently I lost this same camera on a ski trip deep in the woods and was really sad I had lost my go anywhere camera.  So I will be ordering another one of these puppies! Thats how much I love this camera!Pros:One of the main reasons I loved this camera is that when you take pictures there isnt one of those crazy pre-flash things that confuse the people who are being photographed.  Some cameras have a really long delay after you push the button to take the picture OR it does this red light strobe effect OR flashes multiple times confusing the hell out of everyone to which flash was real thus giving you a closed eyes or weird faces in the pic.  This camera wont do that. You can do a half press which will turn on a red eye light and a full press will take the pic with a reasonably short delay.It is really small and can fit right in your pocket without it feeling bulky- this was great for me because I like to carry my camera where ever I go in case the perfect picture or video opportunity pops up.  After dropping my original 750 in the water I purchased a 790 10mp Canon PowerShot SD790IS 10MP Digital Camera with 3x Optical Image Stabilized Zoom and although that is also a great camera I was a bit disappointed because it is noticeably thicker and heavier in the pocket.  So I gave that one to my parents and refurbished the one I dropped into the lake.  The 750 is much lighter and thinner than the 790 and you can forget about it being in your pocket while the 790 felt more bulky and clunky to have in my pants pocket.The 3\" view screen is great!  You know when you take a picture, those people want to see the picture instantly so you have to show them the camera.  Well that is another reason I bought this model for the wider than average 3\" screen.  It is larger than most point and shoot camera and is very clear. Its much better than reviewing your pics and videos in a 2.5\" screen.You can shoot movies!  My 8gb sd card was able to get over an hour of movie filming that is pretty good quality 30fps with sound!  This is great if you have a on the fly funny moment or accident or anything where you want to have a video camera right in your pocket :)  Although at night and low light it is a bit low quality because it doesnt have any night vision feature or anything in good light the video quality is pretty good and good enough for casual users.Overall if you are looking for a light weight, easy to use, feature packed camera I highly recommend this model :)", "Date": "December 17, 2009"}, {"Title": "Outstanding camera", "Author": "Rachael Carson", "ReviewID": "R3A793XYBB27NO", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I had purchased this camera brand new last summer.

Since then I upgraded to a Sony Cybershot DSC P-8 (3.2 MP), and then to a Sony Cybershot T1 (5.0 MP).  I loved my Sony T1 because it was thin and small, and the lens zoomed without retracting in and out of the camera so I knew it would never get sand in between the layers as it zoomed and because you could do basic in-camera editing, like zoom in and crop pictures and save a copy or replace the original.  I loved Sony cameras, their ease of use and NEVER thought I'd change brands.  Until some friends of ours were snapping pictures and asked me to take a picture with their camera.  It was the Canon SD 750.  They LOVED it and one of them worked with cameras all day, including Nikon DSLR's like the d70 and d90.  He said he often took this Canon SD750 to work because it was lighter and took excellent pictures.  I liked the HUGE bright viewing screen and noticed that it took way better pictures than my camera, especially at night.  At the time, this camera was only $172 and I had paid over $350 for my T1 so I decided to give it a try.  I LOVED IT FROM THE START!!  I got a 4GB Micro SD card and a USB Micro SD card reader and it took some excellent pictures.  I went on a trip 6 months later and got the dreaded LENS ERROR.  It would not turn on, even when I took the batteries out. I called Canon and they told me where to send it to get it repaired.  I was really disappointed because I had over a month of other trips planned in the following weeks and I'd have no camera to use.  TO MY SURPRISE, the LENS ERROR went away randomly when I tried to turn it on 2 days later before I sent it in!  It was working fine again.  I've had the camera for 18 months now and have come across the LENS ERROR 5-6 times but it's always fixed itself in no more than a day or two.  Last time it happened I thought the camera was done for, but i just gave it a tap on the back trying to dislodge the jam and it began working again!!  I LOVE this camera SO MUCH that IF IT BROKE I WOULD RE-BUY THE SAME CAMERA, even with all the 10 and 12 MP cameras out there, including the newer versions of this one.  Considering that the supply of these cameras is probably low and demand is still high, price has gone up (drastically on Amazon) but I would shop around and still end up buying this camera.I HIGHLY Recommend this camera to you.  Don't be fooled by higher Megapixel cameras, this one is perfect and you won't be able to tell the difference between Megapixels in cameras unless you are printing giant posters.  The camera takes great pics even if you are a novice (it REALLY DOES, even my mom can take a decent pic with this camera) but in the end it is your improving skill as a photographer that will produce great pictures, NOT the Megapixels.This camera (and most Canons) also has Color Accent, a feature which allows you to choose a color from your subject area and it will capture the picture as black & white with the color you selected as an accent... so it'll be black & white & green for example.  It's AWESOME.I've also used the Stich-Assist feature which allows you to stitch together a panoramic view.  This would be awesome if you were printing on canvas, for example and wanted to print 3-4 pictures and line them up on your wall to create a beautiful artistic display.  I've bought a series of 3 prints like that before at IKEA and knowing that I can do that on my own now is amazing.I Love this camera and the screen on the back is bigger than most of the Canon's or Sony's I've seen on the market now, which is a year and a half after I got it!

The screen got scuffed a bit but that's to be expected and doesn't necessarily degrade my opinion of the camera, especially because its mostly my fault.  Fits in my pocket great too, good for Friday nights and such.  Its a little slow in red eye mode but that's easily fixed by changing it out of that mode.  Love the screen size.

I bought the identical camera for myself last year, so I have a year's experience with it to share with you. In my opinion Canon makes the best digital cameras. This model was rated the best by Consumer Reports last year and I bought it on their recommendation.  They were right. It's great. Amazon is selling it for half of what last year's price was. What a bargain!  It's a great all around camera. Very fine color and imaging. The camera can automatically set itself for a high ISO, so indoor pictures are bright even if you don't use the flash. The battery charges in about two hours and one charge lasts for many days. The controls are easy to use. The optical zoom is more than adequate. My suggestion is you also buy a 2 gigabyte chip to go with it since that will allow you to take more than 1000 pictures without unloading the chip. You can get a 2 gig chip for $[...] at [...] and elsewhere. A spare battery is useful, but not necessary. You can buy a clone of the Canon battery online for about half the price of the Canon one. I'm trying to think of negative things to say about this camera, but I can't think of any other than the fact that the door that gives you access to the chip and battery is plastic and seems very flimsy. But I've used the camera for a year and haven't had any problem with it, though I worried about it initially. The newer model has a stabilization feature. This one doesn't.

My mom's camera's screen broke (casio model) and ended up needing to be replaced. If the screen breaks then there goes the camera. But, I guess that's the trend with most digi cams now a days. Big lcd with no view finder.So far the battery has lasted a really long time, though I'm thinking about getting another battery for a back up when we're on a trip or away. I was at the zoo and the battery was dying and I couldn't take any more pictures. I have a power inverter for my car, so I could plug it in there if on a long trip but it still takes 2-3 hours to fully charge so I couldn't have done that at the zoo. The battery also needs to come out of the camera each time you charge it, there isn't a cord or docking station to charge it like other cameras.

Now I can simply enter what time zone I'm at if I'm not at my \"HOME\" location without having to change time/date3) Up to 1600 ISO so that I can take pictures in relatively dark environment without using flash if I so choose4) Small and compact and best of all, LIGHT!  I can barely feel the weight of this thing.  The SD500 used to feel quite heavy even though they are both the same dimensions (SD500 was slightly fatter)5) Custom self timer where I can change the delay longer than 10s as my SD500 was restricted to6) Lots more SCN options that will allow you to get the best automated picture exposure for various situations7) Continuous shooting capability (multiple shots where the limit is only the size of the your SD card).8) Able to custom create folders in the SD memory card so that I can organize my shots...  for example - if I am vacationing in Europe, I can create a folder for England then another for France, etc... that way, I'm not half guessing where each scenery was shot from9) I can embed date into the picture if I so choose", "Date": "September 14, 2008"}, {"Title": "Really Really great camera!!

The compact design along with packed features and reasonable price (under $200) makes the SD750 a perfect gift; as I found out. I personally own an SD600 and love it! This updated design is a little larger, due to its screen but easily fits into your pocket or small purse. The processor is quicker and the viewing procedure is a little more complex, but I can understand why they did what they did. The ease of use is amazing and VERY user friendly. The one thing I LOVE about Canon is ease of use and features packed into their units! Kodak makes a great line of cameras that are very comparable and would highly recommend them, if you are looking for something a little less expensive and / or like the Easy Share docking station.-you wont be disappointed : )", "Date": "August 29, 2008"}, {"Title": "Excellent point and shoot", "Author": "J.

This camera is definitely not for professionals who like to play with lot of manual adjustments, but this is an excellent camera to own for anyone who don't want to play with manual controls. Caution: though this camera comes with ISO1600, try to avoid using it since it causes the picture to be grainy - ISO200 thru ISO400 should be ideal for low light situations.", "Date": "August 27, 2008"}, {"Title": "Great Camera!!", "Author": "Sheron Patrick", "ReviewID": "R14CXLKEOSD0GJ", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I love my Canon SD750.

Spectacular camera.", "Author": "Andy Keating \"CollegeTechie 2008\"", "ReviewID": "RJPGUYE4QYZGI", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "What a spectacular camera. You start off with one of the lowest startup costs the market can offer, and you are sent one of the most sleek, savvy, and technologically advance cameras out there. The Canon Powershot SD750 is one I can recommend to call, and believe me, I have gone through my good share of cameras.Why do you want to believe this review? I'm going to give you a couple of quick reasons why you should. You don't have to, and truthfully I wouldn't believe text either. However, I can guarantee you that once you hold this camera in your hands, test drive it, and see the prints it produces, you will be in love. In LOVE, I tell you.1. You get a camera that doesn't take that much brainpower if you are not willing to dedicate yourself to learning how to use it.Most cameras now days are going to give you too many features for a non-aficionado of photography. Just flip the camera on, and go between the \"Auto\" mode, and you can also dive into some specific \"Scene\" modes that customize the camera for a specific cause, i.e. \"Aquarium\" or \"Kids and Pets\" You can always dive in more to the camera if you're willing.2. Affordability.You pay around $200.00 for the camera itself, a cute case, and an SD card of suitable size. This camera is not going to cost you an arm and a leg for great prints and shots.3. 7.1 Megapixel,BABY!If you don't know what that means, let me give it to you simple: a good picture. Advanced version of that: A lot of dots, in essence 7,100,000 dots. A lot of dots to make up a picture, and the more dots you will need for enlargements (Bigger paper, more ink, more dots.) That's megapixels for you.4. Older folks CAN use this!Me being 18, my needs are met. Imagine if you are 70 and looking for a good camera. It will be just fine. You can't screw this one up, and you are going to snap some of the best pictures ever, especially if you are still using film! Trust me, this is an extraordinary camera, which can meet a college level photo class requirement camera, all the way to the most novice of users, ages 40 and up.Among these, you should be able to see that this camera and its easy to use interface is just the camera for you. I am not here to market this camera to you, but only here to enlighten you as to how fun and easy this camera is out of the box, and yet if you are a photographer geared to take picturesque shots, you can do that just as well using some of the advanced features, such as adjustable exposure, white balance, and advanced color swapping and warping technology.The Canon SD750 is one I cannot go without on a daily basis. The question is if you are going to join me on having one of the best and most affordable cameras Canon has to offer? The choice is yours.

One thing that annoys me is that anytime you change a setting (eg.from color accent to macro) the flash doesn't automatically turn on. You have to manually switch it from \"off\" to \"auto.\" I've missed some good pictures because my flash didnt FLASH. Also, the auto rotate feature can be kind of annoying. I loved it at first, but every once in a while, it gets on my nerves when I'm trying to show someone a picture on the camera. If you tilt it even slightly, the picture will rotate automatically, and you kind of have to shake it to turn it back. These things are simply annoying, but in NO way affect the quality of this cameraOther than that, I have no complaints. I love the huge LCD screen, and I don't even NOTICE that I don't have a viewfinder. Even in bright, sunny weather, this hasn't been an issue for me at all.

Also, if you wish to review your pictures you do not need to turn the camera on, you just press a little button for immediate reviewing.

I was very pleased with it, and that positive experience led to this purchase.Specs on this camera are very similar to the SD1000, SD800 and A560.  They all use the same DIGIC chip anyway.  The SD750 has Face Recognition, which is handy if you like it, and easily switched off in circumstances where it's not desired.  This model does not have Image Stabilization, but will perform as any normal camera would under low-light conditions.This model sports the 3\" LCD screen and omits the viewfinder.  Some people see this as a drawback, but I rather like it.  The LCD is bright enough to use in all but the most direct bright sunlight, so I don't miss the viewfinder at all.There are enough controls on the camera so shots can be exposed to your liking with only minimal manual intervention.  It's certainly not a direct competitor with an SLR of course, but it comes close in terms of image quality as far as I'm concerned.  There's even long exposure setting, and rear-curtain and slow-sync flash settings for night shooting.It makes a great, compact device to have in your pocket or backpack when lugging a bigger, heavier SLR isn't desired.  I'm even convinced that between the tiny optics and the sensor, that this little pocket camera does a good job at blending high-contrast shots with which my SLR always struggles.", "Date": "December 20, 2007"}, {"Title": "Excellent quality for the price", "Author": "S.

I carefully read as many reviews as possible and then compiled a list of possibilities. I went to Fry's, Circuit City, and Best Buy to see them in person. This camera beat the other 19 cameras that were in consideration.The anti-shaking feature alone is worth the price. If I tried to take a picture with my Samsung I had to take steady aim as though I were trying to shoot a dime from a mile away. A single hearbeat while trying to take aim would almost blur the entire picture. This camera doesn't even give you the chance to do that. I now take perfect pictures at least 95% of the time. The 5% is usually my fault.The other features are amazing, as well. You can single out a particular color to keep in the picture while the rest will remain in black and white. It's like the black and white greeting cards with the two kids holding a single red rose. We took a B/W picture of fireplace with only the flame color showing up and it looked absolutely amazing! You can also add borders and other really great effects.The battery life is excellent. The extra large screen is superb. I read other reviews where they complained that there was no viewfinder present on this model. Why do you need one when what you see on the screen is what you're taking a picture of? It's pretty simple. My technologically impaired wife mastered all of the features after tinkering around with it in less than 20 minutes.In summary, my wife and I love this camera and we no longer fear wasting our precious memories on crappy technology.

Here are my top complaints:1) BIG DELAY between when you depress the shutter button to take the picture and when the camera actually takes the picture. I really do not like this; I want the camera to capture when I press, not afterwards. This isn't a huge problem when taking stills but for action, kids, people, or anything else that tends to move, this is a BIG problem.2) Blurry results. Another reviewer was right that when you download you will notice a significant blur to photos you can't see as well on the LCD screen when taking photos. I got better results when I turned off the face recognition feature but I am still highly disappointed with the lack of image sharpness and difficulties correcting the blur from one condition to the next.3) ONLY USES LCD to frame the photo; I prefer the ability to view through an eye piece when I need precision.4) LCD screen is such a significant portion of the camera, it is impossible not to touch it with fingers and hand thus smudging the screen. I constantly find myself trying to clean the screen. Since the screen is the only way to view and frame your shot, this is very, very frustrating - I like a clean screen.Overall, I have buyer's remorse. I cannot recommend this camera. I prefer to carry around a faster, bulkier SLR.

I googled the problem and apparently many people have experienced this same problem. The camera functions and then without warning the screen goes black and picture taking is impossible.  People have identified the problem. It's quite prevalent. Canon unknowingly has been using a faulty Sony ccd chip in the camera.  The blogs said that Canon would fix the problem even if past warranty. That turned out to not be true.  Canon wanted $99 plus shipping to fix it. The camera is 2 years old and it's probably been used 12 times. They have faulty chips in this camera and I don't know what other models.

Every time I try to get a close up of my baby she squints because the red light is so bright and then most of the time the picture comes out too white, its almost like the flash is too strong for close ups.  Regular pictures even come out grainy.  I was really disappointed with that.  Another thing is the action shots... yea right...dont even bother because those come out horrible.Yes its compact, and the size and style is cool but the picture quality is not good.The video portion however is probably the best I have seen it on a canon.  It takes long and very clear sounding videos.  So I was happy with that portion of it.Also every time you tap the camera the wrong way the picture moves from horizontal to vertical which is really annoying.I definitly do not like this camera or suggest it to anyone, especially if you like taking close up pics of your baby like I do.", "Date": "March 10, 2008"}, {"Title": "GREAT CAMERA", "Author": "Dena R Bradley", "ReviewID": "R3TRK8OH4HLPWJ", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "THIS CAMERA HAS ALOT FOR BEING SO SMALL.

That's only 40 miles from me.  If they'd just let the camera out of the box it probably could have made its own way here faster than Amazon's delivery.

I'm reviewing this model because it is the most similar and the SD500 is basically out of stock.jpeg compression can still be agressive even at the finest setting and you feel that the 7.1 MP cited is kind of meaningless.  That said it is much, much better than the kodak I upgraded from.  On cloudy days most of your pictures will be washed out and you'll have to chuck them.  Indoor shots at IS400 are pretty noisy as well and Image Stabilization isn't present in these models.  A kodak might produce nicer colors as well, but a bit of digital editing can fix that.  Landscape shots will often focus at about 1 foot away and be completely blurry as well.  The movie mode is very high quality, but the option to compress with say .mpeg would be very, very handy.  If you're away from your computer those movies will fill up your memory card in no time but they will look great. I found the scene modes to be worthless and used manual mode most of the time.  Auto results in pictures that are too light and washed out, so you'll be adjusting the manual settings a lot.Even after all the pictures and resulting recharges, I can still get hundreds of pictures on a single charge.  Having to remove the battery is a non-issue.  It won't wear out.The SD500 was just a bit heavy, but the 750 is much slimmer.  Likewise the screen wasn't impressive on the 500 either, but apparently that has been much improved here as well.I've looked for an upgrade to this camera for some time now and found nothing worthy except very pricey, bulky cameras.  For a lot of shots even those aren't appreciably better.  So I'll be stuck with my SD500 for about 3 years, and I think that says a lot for the camera.", "Date": "October 16, 2007"}, {"Title": "maybe SD630 is better?", "Author": "Christina", "ReviewID": "RO53MVTD7J90Q", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I purchased this SD750 for my parents.
