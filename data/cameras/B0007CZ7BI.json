{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Pretty good camera for the price", "Author": "C. Arnaud", "ReviewID": "RG5KCJYCZTCAT", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I bought the Sony DSC-W5 few weeks ago, so far I'm quite pleased with it. The choice was between this one and the Canon SD-400, both are 5MP as I think that's the optimum resolution for my use. Looks like both cameras have similar picture quality with a slight edge for the Canon.So what decided me for the Sony? Mainly these 4 reasons:- I have a Canon G2, which is slow and bulky, but most of all, after 3 years of use the image quality is degradating. Paid $800 for it 3 years ago, one would expect a longer product life.-Battery. Canon does not know how to measure battery power, it goes from full to empty in 5mn, that's very frustrating as you have to fully charge the battery the day before you're going to use your camera. Sony gives you a detailed view of the charge left, and even in the case you run out of it, you can plug in 2 plain AA batteries.- Sony is fast, very fast.- Sony has a large bright LCD, it's a pleasure to take shots and look at the pictures on the 2.5' lCD.I found the sony very easy to use, the settings are easily accessible and are memorised through power ups (which is sometimes bothersome as you have to check all your settings before using the camera at the begining of the day)About blurry pictures, on something like 100 pictures I only had a few that were blurry. Mainly if you press the button half way and wait for the camera to autofocus, you'll get a good picture. Also the flash is required as soon as the luminosity dims a bit. The only defect I could find is on the autofocus, I believe the balanced autofocus feature gets confused on some situations, even simple ones like a mountain landscape with no tree in front.Setting the autofocus to center may solve the problem. Also Sharpness should be set to \"+\" otherwise you get very soft images.Conclusion: A great product for the price, picture quality is fantastic (most of the times), the LCD is a charm to look at.", "Date": "May 30, 2005"}, {"Title": "clarification of the \"little waving hand\"", "Author": "Luke J. Harmon \"Luke\"", "ReviewID": "R2RP0CYUSX4NSV", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Just a clarification of the negative reviews below - the \"little waving hand\" does not mean that the camera is moving.  Instead, it means that you are trying to take a photo with a setting that would require a very steady hand to get a sharp result.  That is why the hand doesn't go away when you put the camera on a table - and you can still take good pictures under these conditions, if the camera is held steady enough.  This is a great little camera that I have been totally satisfied with so far.  And, just as an aside, this information is in the user's manual, it might be a good idea to read this over before writing bad reviews on this site.", "Date": "May 6, 2005"}, {"Title": "Excellent manual control - Lightning fast", "Author": "MY", "ReviewID": "R3U7MDNXOZ79B7", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Just to be clear: this is a great camera. It feels solid, starts up instantly, takes good pictures, and has manual controls. It takes AA batteries, has an optical viewfinder, can take expansion lenses, has a huge LCD, and has an AF-assist lamp. Great!I really like the manual controls. It takes a little while to get used to if you've always been a point-n-shooter like me. But having the controls means that you can take shots that a regular automatic camera in this class would never be able to get. There is actually a 30 second exposure mode, which is very unusual in this class of camera. Read the manual and you will be able to take photos in all lighting conditions.Unfortunately, even with manual controls this camera suffers in low-light. All cameras without image-stabilization are going to tend to be blurry in low-light. But for some reason, Sony has made their cameras (even the P series cameras) especially sensitive. We were touring around cathedrals in Europe and it is very difficult to get a clear shot because you can't use the flash and the lighting is always a little dark. The solution is to use a tripod, which will give you fantastic pictures. But without one, you have to be creative.But even so, when you set things up right this camera takes beautiful pictures - well-saturated colors, not much graininess. But it will take some learning. If you just want a camera you can leave on Auto all day, you may want a different brand.", "Date": "September 1, 2005"}, {"Title": "Great Pictures Vibrant Color and fast shutter speed", "Author": "Jamie Basler \"Jamie B\"", "ReviewID": "R2IJUWKZ952PR1", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "We took over 350 pictures in Walt Disney World, two were blurry, the speed of this camera is incredible.  I cannot believe how quickly we were able to shoot pictures. I am totally impressed with this camera.  We have had a digital HP and Cannon and this is worlds above!  I would reccomend this to anyone with children.  The cannon took good pictures but the timing was awful.  It could take 20 seconds for the camera to be ready for another picture.

Sure, HP and Canon are cheeper but Sony has a better camera. This thing can take pictures and movies with sound. My old camera was only 640x480(VGA) and could also take 1024x1024 pictures. The Sony can take VGA images for email and websites, 1 Megapixel, 3 Megapixel, 3.2 Megapixels, and 5 Megapixel images. In movie mode, you are only limited by the memory stick. You can also change movie sizes. The 3X optical zoom is a plus. The different modes for shooting are also useful. I have a Sony VAIO laptop so I can just slide the memory stick out and put into my laptop's built in port. If you have a Sony computer, this camera will work wonders. With the LCD on, I can get over an hour of battery life on just 2 AA batteries. I also like the fact it includes rechargeable batteries and a battery charger. I also got extra Duracell 2500mAh NIMH batteries. I got 8 extra batteries so I can shoot and shoot pictures. I got mine at officemax for $299.99 with a free 256MB memory stick. I would wait for this deal to get your camera. The Sony is also very fast when it comes to displaying and saving images. My old 1997 Olympus camera took 10 secs to save and forever to display on the small 1.5in LCD. The Sony takes 3-4 secs or less to save the image and displays them in an instant. The LCD is also large (2.5in) for it's class. With the huge LCD on it really dosen't suck the batteries. (Yeah!)It is a little thicker than the $300.00 Canon ELPH but the Sony is overall better to me. There are so many features that it comes with a tutorial that explains all the settings and picture shooting modes. Overall, I really love this little camera.", "Date": "November 22, 2005"}, {"Title": "Awesome camera!", "Author": "MishiB \"MishiB\"", "ReviewID": "R1BPQWT8XU0NH9", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I got this camera after passing on a 4 mp Olympus to my daughter and having my new 5 mp Canon stolen. I ended up almost glad that the Canon was stolen, because my new Sony is so much better. It is easy to use and fast (my husband is a track and cross country coach, and this camera is quick enough to get each runner as they pass during a race) and produces great pictures.I also like it's size. I'm not a fan of the itsy-bisty, super-thin cameras; I like to have something to hold onto. This is still small, but not credit-card small. I love the big view-screen, though, and it works well in the bright sunlight.I researched a lot of cameras, then took a chance and bought one I hadn't even looked into.

The camera has the capability of a very long exposure, which I've enjoyed immensely, and the night shots I've taken are super.  I enjoy remodeling. The W5 has a 30mm screw mount, and I purchased the wide-angle lens at my local Sony Style store. I am very happy that I have the capability to add lenses and/or filters.  The person who complains that the \"waving hand\" shows when the light is low -- yes, it is just a warning -- so you the user knows what's going on. You know if the camer is not stable you could get some fuzziness. I think it's better to know that something requires a little caution, than to get crummy pictures because I didn't know.  It has a large screen, it has a screw mount for lenses/filters, it has a metal screw base for tripod use, it uses regular AA batteries, it uses my old Sony memory (plus the new Sony Pro memory I bought), it takes 640 x 480, 30 frame per second video, with sound, and it's among the lightest in this class.

Because most of  my photography is of kids snowboarding and playing hockey, this was a serious drawback.I purchased the Sony Cybershot DSC-W5 almost a year ago after doing a lot of research and testing many models out at varoius stores.  Everything about it seemed perfect.  It had every feature I was looking for and did all of it faster than any other camera I could find. The one thing that you can't test at a store, however, is the quality of the pictures.  Pity.In the automatic mode the color quality of the photos is terrible and not at all true, it doesn't handle various lighting situations well, and the photos are often less than crisp.  Even after manipulating them on photo software, they are still lacking. I have tried various settings and read and re-read the manual hoping to find some clue to solving the problems.Interestingly, my sister has the same camera and she is equally disappionted with the photos it takes for the same reasons.My advice, keep shopping.", "Date": "November 7, 2005"}, {"Title": "Great Camera!", "Author": "MurphysLaw", "ReviewID": "R3VDCCGO85HQ8A", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I did quite a bit of research on compact digital cameras before spending the money.  I have tried several different brands in the past so I'm not some Sony-Maniac or anything but let me tell you, I am very impressed with this camera.  The display is HUGE and extremely easy to see in all lighting conditions, even in direct sunlight.  The buttons are a bit tiny but also intuitive so you don't feel like you're fumbling around trying to snap a shot.  The power-up time and time between shots is incredibly short.  The camera is light-weight but feels solid, not cheap or flimsy.  The dial on the top, which lets you switch the picture mode menu is easy to access and use.  The pictures come out sharp and clear and the colors are amazing, not washed out or distorted.  The manual features are fairly easy to operate and in fact the camera is so self-explanatory that you can get the camera up and running without even looking at the manual.  The software that comes with the camera is decent as well, although if you really like to tweak your pictures, you'll want to upgrade.  The fact that you can use AA batteries instead of proprietary batteries is a feature everyone can appreciate.  The camera is about the size of a deck of cards so it can be taken with you just about anywhere.  The 5.1 megapixels and the 3X optical zoom make this tiny little camera stand up to models much higher in price.", "Date": "October 20, 2005"}, {"Title": "good little camera", "Author": "M.

It's a Sony.2.  You get recharging batteries, but you can use regular batteries if you have to (a feature not available on many Canons).3.  Super user-friendly.  Easy to use and easy to hook up to external devices.4.  Beautiful big screen.5.  Very light and portable.6.  You can actually get shots with both the background and the foreground in focus (ex:  picture of someone standing 30 feet in front of a waterfall...both person and waterfall come in beautifully).Not-so-good points:1.  Camera dedicated carrying case costs a bunch (like $40).  It's a great case, though.2.  You have to be relatively motionless in order not to get the blur-factor.3.  You really have to be aware of your light.  Or you'll get dark shots.  I didn't experience this with my much older Canon.4.  6mp cameras are so cheap now, why get the 5.1?", "Date": "June 3, 2006"}, {"Title": "Great!

The DSCW-5 is quite a bit smaller and lighter than the V1.  Another good feature about the DSCW5 is that is runs on two AA batteries that in an emergency you could purchase from any store.Battery life however on non-rechargable batteries would not be good, but it is better than haveing a dead specialized battery, like most other cameras have including my V1.Overall I would reccomend The DSCW5 by SonyMAY 2006I still love this camera. my only wish is that it had a larger viewing screen.

Battery life is good, especially considering the LCD is almost always on. The camera has a great auto focus system that takes a few minutes of reading to learn how to use, but is very helpful if you actually read up on it.Picture quality is very good outdoors and pretty good indoors. The flash often creates red-eye, even with the red-eye reduction on. The indoor shots tend to be a little cool in color.

I discovered this as my wife was in the hospital giving birth to our second child.  Not a good time for a camera to break.The camera was under warranty so I sent it back, along with proof of purchase and it was repaired and sent back to me.  I have since moved to Georgia.  Two weeks ago, at Laurens Christmas recital, the camera breaks again.  It won't power on...the exact same issue as the first time.  So, no pictures there.  That's two important times in my life when my digital camera is incapable of taking pictures.I called Sony, and sent the camera back to them for the same repair.  I told them the whole story while he typed away and gave me a 2nd work order number.  One week later, I get an e-mail stating they had received the camera but could not repair it because I did not send in my proof of purchase.  Now, I'm sure I have that receipt in an unpacked box somewhere, but I don't really know where it is and I don't feel like I should have to go search for it.  It's not where I thought it was, and I don't want to go on a massive receipt hunt.I just got off the phone with customer service.  He advised me that if I purchased the camera with a credit card, I could call my CC company and get them to send me a statement which I could fax.  Again, I could do all that, but I shouldn't have to.  The camera broke twice, it was repaired (sort of) once, and I have been inconvienienced enough.  I'm told that they don't keep proof of purchases from previous repairs, thus the need for me to work harder.  If I had the receipt to fax in (I don't have a fax machine in my house either), it would make things easier.  He'll see what he can do but cannot make any promises.Here are just a few questions I have from this ordeal:  1. Why do Sony DSCW5's not work properly?  2. They don't keep scans of receipts from repair jobs, but they expect me to have this handy when it suits them?  3. Shouldn't they resolve issues at my convienience, not theirs?  Why are they interested in making this easier for customer support and the repair shop at my expense?  4. Why do you have to speak to technical support, then get transferred to customer service, who sends e-mails back to technical support while I am sitting on hold?", "Date": "January 4, 2006"}, {"Title": "If you have kids, DO NOT buy this camera", "Author": "T&J;'s Mom", "ReviewID": "R3CZMBP99HB760", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "If you have kids and want to take pictures of them inside, then do NOT buy this camera.

Its kinda big and bulky. It looks small but put in your pants pocket and you'll be annoyed after walking 5 steps. Its also a little on the heavy side. I'm comparing it to the similarly priced Sony T33, a much thinner and lighter camera. If you're shooting something in action you'll probably miss the shot because it takes a few seconds to autofocus. You have to use red eye flash which takes longer and eats the battery faster. Unless you prefer to have red eyes in every pic. But overall I like this camera. The LCD screen is awesome. Its so clear even when you zoom in. You can actually see the pic without having to upload it to your computer screen. This helps b/c you can just retake any bad looking pics. If you only take posed still photos then this camera is all you'll ever need. I use red eye flash because I'm too lazy to go back and remove the red eyes from every pic.

For example, when I'm in the automatic mode, the camera would randomly switch to the review mode for no reason.  Also, when I take pictures using the self-timer, the pictures now sometimes turn out blurry - it doesn't make sense to me because nothing holding the camera is moving (the subject isn't moving either).Also, this camera is rather bulky and heavy compared to some compact digital cameras out in the market today.This camera is a little confusing to use (even with the manual) when trying to control the settings manually.

The streaks the other reviewers complained about are so much fun.)Anyway, my two problems with the camera are technical.  One, the \"M\" function simply can't be used, it just continues to say that it's taking the picture and I have to take the batteries out to make it stop.  I'm sure it's something that could easily be fixed, but since the warranty is expired I'm stuck for now.  The other is that sometimes the camera will think I'm changing the function when I'm not, and has caused problems while I'm trying to take a picture or view them.  I think this is a software problem, and probably isolated.  A friend of mine bought the same camera and hasn't mentioned any problems with hers.Overall though, I do like my camera.  I use the other functions enough that I don't miss the \"M\" one too badly, and as for the other problem I can live with it until I can afford a bigger, better camera.", "Date": "August 4, 2005"}, {"Title": "More than meets the eye.", "Author": "Joao Vicente", "ReviewID": "R2CK1FCG1ZMT7A", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I'll be very short, and I want you all to read this: This camera is way out of the curve, because its so much better than any other camera released with similar format / specifications / price.

It took great pictures -- never blurry -- in all light situations.  My only complaint was that as one of the first generation digital cameras, the shutter lag was horrible!  So, I had high hopes for the DSC-W5 when my husband gave it to me for Christmas two years ago.  While the shutter lag was much improved, I quickly learned that this new camera did not do so well in low light, and if my hand moved in the slightest or unless our children sat less than absolutely still while taking a picture (those of you with kids are laughing right now, right?), the photo came out blurry.  However, I became more disappointed when we had owned the camera for just under a year and the dial that allows you to move between modes started malfunctioning.  Every time I tried to switch it to review mode, it would stay in camera mode.  It was impossible to review photos unless the dial was set precariously between movie mode and review mode.  We sent the camera back to Sony, and to their credit, they fixed it within a couple of weeks with no charge.  However, it's been about a year since the repair and the dial is starting to malfuction again.  The camera is also starting to eat batteries like crazy -- even the expensive rechargable kind.  I wish I could recommend this camera since I was so satisfied with the photo quality of the DCS-S85.

Thanks Amazon!).I purchased my DSC-W5 a little over a year ago and have been very pleased with it. The main reasons I decided to purchase this camera was its small size and the fact that you could get an underwater housing for it. I've had other underwater cameras but I found this one to be great above and below the water. With the housing being so small you can use it at the beach/pool or the big waterfest, Songkran, in Thailand without worrying about getting it wet.The other things that I've really liked since I purchased it is the manual setting (good for underwater and sun sets) and the ability to use standard AA batteries (this has saved me many times when my rechargeable have gone dead). I have also purchased the zoom lens... It helps the  3X zoom. When using the zoom  you sometimes get the black hole effect on the edges, but you just have to work around it or crop it later. I've thought about the underwater filters but Sony is very proud of them (ie. to expensive). I just use a Photoshop action in Elements called underwater that I got from the Adobe's share site to color correct pix's.The video is good also. I've used it for underwater and the high quality setting gives you a pretty good video even on my 50\" HD TV. It does eat up a lot of space on the 1G chip, but what do you want... (may need to order a bigger one if they're now available)Friends of mine have liked my camera so much they've purchased the W7. Another thing I'm hoping is Sony will continue the line so you can purchase accessories in the future (underwater housing, I had an Olympus/5050 with underwater housing, but after a year or so you could not find replacement accessories so I had to buy a new camera (ie. W5).The only con on the camera is the red eyes from the flash being so close to the lens. But then I use Elements to fix that in a jiffy.Other features that would make it even better are (Sony are you listening): More manual settings. I would like it to have the infrared capability of other Sony's. Another feature that would be great and don't understand why companies have not added it would be... time-laps photography using the video or still capability.", "Date": "November 15, 2006"}, {"Title": "excelent!!", "Author": "Diogmarys", "ReviewID": "RPOJSTH8AYKWP", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I buyed this camera because this model fits in a case or marine pack to take underwater pictures..thanks a lot", "Date": "January 1, 2014"}, {"Title": "Camera does not work", "Author": "Shalveen Shah", "ReviewID": "RAE8OY6U08R7Y", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "The camera shuts off every time I try to take a picture with it.
