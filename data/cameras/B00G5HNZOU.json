{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Great camera but the extras are iffy", "Author": "Geoffrie Kramer", "ReviewID": "R26OP6LSQH6KR", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "First, we absolutely love the camera.  The camera, lens, camera bag, and all Nikon products are fabulous.  The spare battery we received with the order was not actually a Nikon product, but instead a third-party.  I was afraid of something like that happening, but the listing says \"spare EN-EL14 battery\".  The battery DOES NOT WORK with the D5300.  The camera returns an error saying: \"This battery cannot be used.  Choose battery designated for use in this camera.\"  The camera will do nothing else with the third-party battery installed, so it is essentially useless.  This doesn't inspire much confidence with the third-party extra battery charger, either, so we feel that both the extra battery charger and extra batter are useless.  We are currently in the process of contacting the seller about this and hope we can reach some agreement about rectifying the situation.The tripod received in the kit is OK, but probably not acceptable for anyone but beginners.  The 64 GB SDxc card seems to perform well.All in all, we probably wouldn't order this package again, but the extras may be worth it for some.  The extras do feel a bit cheap, however, and it may be worth a little more money to buy more appropriate gear for an $1100 camera and lens package.", "Date": "January 13, 2014"}, {"Title": "It does everything but cook and clean!", "Author": "Toughtoy4x4", "ReviewID": "R37IOM58O7IUPV", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Actually, it does clean! I don't know how but it can clean it's own image sensor.My wife and I decided to move up from point-and-shoot to DSLR for more variety and ability to take pictures with a little more special effect and lighting. This camera is way more than we really needed but it has the ability to take video at up to 60 frames per second (analog broadcast speed) for realistic playback without the \"jerkiness\" of slower video capture speeds.The camera body is small in my large hands but still comfortable. The feature buttons and mode dial are well placed and easy to use once you remember where they are. The ability to change lenses according to your intended purpose takes some getting used to but once you have, it gives you the ability to take great shots you would otherwise have missed while waiting for the traditional point-and-shoot camera to make up it's mind about focus and zoom.The accessories that came with the camera are useful and of good quality, even though they are not manufactured by Nikon. The case that comes with it is a little small if you plan to add lenses and other accessories bu it would serve well if you take just what you need for a specific type of photo session.I highly recommend both this camera and the seller. Great customer service and information!", "Date": "January 17, 2014"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": "$1,199.95", "Features": "KIT INCLUDES 15 PRODUCTS -- All BRAND NEW Items with all Manufacturer-supplied Accessories + Full USA Warranties:\n<1> Nikon D5300 Digital SLR Camera Body (Black) + <2> Nikon 18-140mm VR DX AF-S Lens + <3> Nikon Digital SLR Camera Case +\n<4> Spare EN-EL14 Battery + <5> Battery Charger + <6> Precision Design DSLR300 Flash + <7> Transcend 64GB SDXC 10 Card +\n<8> Precision Design 58\" Tripod + <9> PD 67mm (UV/CPL/ND8) Filters + <10> Universal Pop-Up Diffuser + <11> PD HDMI to Mini-HDMI Cable +\n<12> Precision Design ML-L3 Remote + <13> PD 6pc Complete Cleaning Kit + <14> PD 8 SD Card Memory Card Case + <15> LCD Screen Protectors", "Name": "Nikon D5300 Digital SLR Camera Body (Black) with 18-140mm VR Zoom Lens + 64GB Card + Case + Flash + Battery & Charger + Tripod Kit", "ImgURL": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/61e98%2BBZf4L._SY300_.jpg", "ProductID": "B00G5HNZOU"}}
