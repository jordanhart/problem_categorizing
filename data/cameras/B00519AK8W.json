I didn't want to take my nicer Panasonic where it could become wet. It takes decent pictures for a point and shoot. The settings are a little difficult to used, but once you get used to them it works well. it is not good for fast action shots, and the Macro mode does not produce good images. The auto mode works well for people that want to use point and shoot cameras. Comparing it to my Panasonic Lumix and to an Olympus Stylus, the photos are not quite as good when looked at large when printed large. However, for images 10 x 8 they are pretty close in quality.  However, for the price, it takes decent photos.", "Date": "May 4, 2013"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": null, "Features": null, "Name": null, "ImgURL": null, "ProductID": "B00519AK8W"}}
