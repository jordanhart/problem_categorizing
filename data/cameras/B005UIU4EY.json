Mulkey", "ReviewID": "R1696574QSPJPS", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Our 4-channel CCTV DVR appliance bit the dust this summer, and I wanted its replacement to be more accessible and versatile.  (The old appliance required Internet Explorer + Active X to view footage, and had limited recording options.)  I opted to roll with Blue Iris for DVR management, and I originally planned to replace each CCTV camera with an outdoor POE IP camera.I quickly discovered that the cost of outdoor POE IP cameras was prohibitive.  I needed something, though, and I really wanted the versatility of Blue Iris.  That's what brought me to this product...I already replaced two of my CCTV cameras with IP cameras, but I'm using the GXV3504 to extend the lives of my other two CCTV cameras.  (Each cameras' feed is now available via RTSP video feed from the GXV3504's LAN IP address.)  For half of the cost of the outdoor POE IP camera I'm targeting, I'm able to get up acquire video feeds from my old, durable CCTV hardware.Currently, I've got two cameras pushing H264-encoded streams at a resolution of 704x480 at 15FPS.  (Blue Iris confirms that the average framerate hovers around 15FPS, plus or minus a few tenths of a frame per second.)  These stats aren't mind-blowing, but the resolution matches one of my camera's native resolutions, and it doesn't trim much off the other -- and the 15FPS is adequate for my application.  Other reviews on other sites have noted significant lag between \"live footage\" and live activity -- 3 to 5 seconds, in some cases -- but I haven't noticed that.  In my testing, the lag is consistently less than 1 second.The product listings and documentation for this product, prior to my purchase, was a little sketchy; wasn't really sure how the POE feature would work.  (I was concerned that it might be a SIP-specific feature.)  I decided to take a flyer on it anyway, since I have the luxury of having an AC outlet near the GXV3504's location.  But the unit handles encoding both CCTV cameras' stream flawlessly, pulling power exclusively from my POE switch over it's CAT6 cable.I've had the unit in place for 5 weeks, with nary a hiccup since its installation.  So far, it strikes me as an exceptional value.Note: I am not using this device's SIP functionality; can't really comment on its functionality/reliability in that regard.", "Date": "September 26, 2013"}, {"Title": "Great price point and solution", "Author": "Reds55", "ReviewID": "R24VFUNM8PJ48V", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I purchased these units to convert a system that was analog at a farm.  They are switching over to IP format but didn't want to just throw away the cameras.I wasn't sure what to expect because of the price, the \"you get what you pay for\".  When I searched Google for encoders it seemed that they were double what these were.  I took a chance an ordered them.Due to the fact that the farm will be running analog and IP formats, I needed a solution to accommodate it.  Blue Iris was the solution.  After trying to figure out how to get Blue Iris to use the encoder, I gave up and subscribed to a Blue Iris Forum. I believe it is called Cam-IT.  I put my issue in a new thread and within a couple  hours had my answer.  I applied it to Blue Iris and boom...done.  The encoders preformed great.  Converting 4 analog signals to 1 IP address.  Orginally I had thought that the encoder would give each of the analog cameras an IP address.  Not the case.  YOu get one IP address and you have to access that IP address and enter in the channel.I will be purchasing more of these for this customer to fulfill the conversion.", "Date": "September 27, 2013"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": "$286.00", "Features": "4 Port IP Video Encoder", "Name": "GrandStream 4 Port IP Video Encoder Voice Over IP - VOIP", "ImgURL": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41fCF201wAL._SX300_.jpg", "ProductID": "B005UIU4EY"}}
