I know you can't expect much for this price.  It is a decent covert camera although I would have asked they not put a screw at the bottom of the unit so its seen anytime this is placed higher than eye level which most if not all the time it would be.  The silver screw stands out and very much cheapens the unit.  Easy to install and yes this has to be hard wired.", "Date": "January 10, 2013"}, {"Title": "Pinhole Camera", "Author": "jim", "ReviewID": "R6Z218T810DLS", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This type camera is outstanding. I bought one to overlook areas that are around 75 to 100 feet away. Where distances greater then 50 feet need to be watched over, these cameras are an excellent option to add to your security system to do just that. And the camera video is clear. You can't beat it at this price.", "Date": "September 2, 2012"}, {"Title": "Just a camera, need to be connected to the recorder.", "Author": "L Trieu", "ReviewID": "R3OW67STCZ3ZI7", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "be careful that this is only a camera to connect to the recorder box if you have one.

Unfortunately I received a unit that was dead on arrival and it only showed a black image on the monitor. Needless to say I was very disappointed as I was hoping to install it along with other model cameras that I also got from Amazon.Luckily, Amazon sent UPS to my door with a prepaid return label and refunded the purchase. I'm very happy with Amazon for making the return of defective goods hassle-free.

But, it worked fine for me covering a 10 x 12 waiting room. Functions as well as any LOW-cost NOT-hidden camera would, without being so obviously invasive. Color, in well-lit interiors, is fine. Sharpness is good enough for just watching a space for people or animals, but obviously not laser sharp. No night vision; leave a light on. Mount can be taken apart for installing the base first, then add the camera back. Very \"plastic\" unit, not heavy duty. Easy does it, just fine.", "Date": "March 7, 2013"}, {"Title": "Can't beat for the price.", "Author": "Carlos Dillard", "ReviewID": "RUSJ5OK873XIE", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Purchased one of these to install with my security camera system and was instantly impress. I looks exactly like several of the other motion detectors already in my home. Set up was easy, clarity was good. Only fault is there is no night vision and though being that it's rated for 1 lux you can still somewhat see what's going on in low light conditions. My neighbor was so impress he asked me to purchase him one, he'd paid a company over $150 for a similar product that did not have the same clarity as this budget camera.Maybe I need to go into the security business!Bottom line, GREAT camera for the price but NO night vision.", "Date": "April 29, 2013"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": "$199.90", "Features": "Image Device: Color CCD image sensor;\nLens: 3.7mm pinhole lens\nMinimum Illumination: 1.0 lux .
