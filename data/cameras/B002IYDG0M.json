{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Got a defective unit", "Author": "Eric M. Yoshimitsu", "ReviewID": "R59WYA0KVGA19", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "We purchased this unit based upon Eastman Kodak's reputation for ease of use and photo quality. This was to be a replacement unit for my Z730. The latter being too big and bulky for my current needs. Based on previous experience with Kodak, I decided to give the M381 a try. Being familiar with the Kodak interface from my previous camera, I felt confident that I could pick up the new camera and get excellent photos immediately without needing to suffer a learning curve.Features I liked: Small size, big LCD screen, familiar menu / user-interface, battery in-camera recharging.What I didn't like: Photo / Video quality.We took our new M381 out for a test drive at Disneyland today; unfortunately nearly all of the photos we took were overexposed, grainy, or completely washed out. Even the best photos had broad pixelated stripes through the photos. The videos were grainy and overexposed as well; fortunately not as badly.  Our trip today was for my wife's birthday; unfortunately none of the photos we took on this trip are useable. While I do like the simplicity of the operation of Kodak products, I cannot endorse this particular unit. While your experience may (hopefully) be better than ours, my confidence in Kodak's quality control has been devastated.I can't comment on battery life as we were not going to keep it long enough to find out. We aren't planning on taking enough photos or videos to kill the battery; we'll be returning it as soon as possible. While it might be worthwhile to return it to get a new unit of the same model, I'm no longer confident the quality control measures are in place at the manufacturer. I can ill-afford to miss more memorable moments to defective cameras.I might someday return to Kodak products, but not for some time.", "Date": "October 28, 2009"}, {"Title": "So far so good", "Author": "Christian J.

With 5x zoom and 12mp, it's a pretty good camera.  Unfortunately, I have to agree with the other reviewer that Kodak's quality control is lacking.  The main reason we like the Kodak EZShare cameras is the \"Blur Reduction\" feature.  With a 2 year old and 4 year old, this feature is a must.  We purchased one M381, and the feature did not work.  Using it, the pictures were less in focus than when we used the normal mode.  We returned it for a replacement, and have been very happy with the replacement.  We have not experienced the grainy pictures the other reviewer mentioned, and are happy with the replacement.", "Date": "November 13, 2009"}, {"Title": "Bad, Fuzzy, Out of FOUCUS", "Author": "LiSam", "ReviewID": "R2NDGVQL1YM8TZ", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I purchased this camera at a Pre-Thanksgiving Sale and was so excited to use it.

I got it for Christmas. I've taken many pictures and they turned out so good! I've also taken several videos and they are very good! I didn't notice any little sounds while taking the videos. It's amazing the things this camera will do. Most cameras only have 1 setting for the flash. The Kodak M381 has four settings. I love this and it works very well. I was using my camera for 3 days and didn't have to recharge the batteries once. I still had plenty of charge left.I also like the size of the camera. It fits in my hand nicely and the menu button and the other functions buttons are easy to use. I would highly recommend this camera to anyone!

I have a 2 year old son and need something that will keep up with his quick moves. After a week of using this camera, I decided to return it. More than half of the pictures we took were incredibly grainy and blurry. Some were excellent, but I don't want a camera that gives me good pictures only half the time. I returned it today and purchased the Canon 1200IS and am so happy with it. For $20 more, it seems like a much better camera. The Kodak was a 12 mp and the Canon is a 10 with a smaller screen, but I still can't say enough good things about it.

You'd think with the extremely long time the camera takes to focus that the picture would be perfect but alas, this is not so...I get worse pictures with this camera than I did back in the days of my polaroid.

I will update this review after I spend more time using it. But here are some thoughts of the things I have read about in other reviews.1st some reviewers have complained about noise while the camera is focusing. It is not that loud but it did make noise that I guess could be a clicking sound. So I checked out my older Kodak and it made the same noise. The older camera is about 5 years old and has been dropped several times. As far as I can tell this is just the sound of the motor that controls the auto focus and appears to be a normal.2nd is the dial on top. Some felt that it was cheap and could break easy or did break. My old camera had a larger dial but feels the same. Again no problem with that one. This is an electronic device and should be handled with care. If you need a tougher camera they make ones for that application.Other than that this camera seems great so far. More to come though.", "Date": "January 19, 2010"}, {"Title": "No Thanks", "Author": "Jeff C.", "ReviewID": "R2Y9E2TX7P4ERI", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "Like the first reviewer, I have been a professional for more than 30 years. I have seen point-and-shoot technology skyrocket in recent years, and have personally shot images with my previous Kodak digital that rivaled those from my expensive digital SLR. I decided to purchase the M381 to use for shooting a client event. Since the event included a rock concert, I did not want to lug around an SLR that probably would not be approved for use in an arena. Of the more than 200 images I shot, perhaps 25 are useable. On the beautiful 3\" LCD, they looked fine when shot. Once offloaded however, they were extremely grainy, and most were too blurred to use. I should be clear that these were images of attendees, not the concert itself, and included many shot at a pre-concert venue that was well-lit. To be fair, a few were stunningly clear and sharp, but shots before and after, with the same settings were terrible.I have always been happy with Kodak products, and after spending huge sums of money over the years on their film, darkroom paper and chemicals, I have a sentimental interest in seeing Kodak succeed in the digital arena. But this camera performed quite poorly in my opinion. Although this item is priced attractively, I cannot afford to try a replacement. I need equipment to perform out of the box. I may try a more expensive Kodak digital in hope that you \"get what you pay for,\" but this was a disappointing experience from a company I trusted.", "Date": "November 23, 2009"}, {"Title": "Not worth it!", "Author": "K. Noulin", "ReviewID": "R11S7V5SZFUQVV", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "The HD video quality on this camera is superb, but that is probably the only thing going for it. Still images often turn out warped, and it has trouble taking pictures in either dim lighting or when it's bright outside. In other words the indoor pictures will often turn out blurry or the photos outside in bright sunlight look like the camera has been pointed directly into the sun. The battery life on the camera is average, but it's major drawback is the construction quality. The camera is very cheaply made and 'feels' very cheap when you hold it. It doesn't have anywhere near the durability of other manufacturer's cameras within the same price range. I treated my camera very well, yet it stopped working only after about 15 months. I turned it on one day, the lens extended out, something internally snapped, and the lens would no longer go back in. And then it wouldn't turn on altogether. I had never dropped nor damaged the camera, yet some internal mechanisms within the camera broke regardless from gentle and normal use. The camera is also a bit bulky when compared to similar makes. The camera also seems to have problems reading memory cards. Mine wouldn't distinguish between a 2GB memory card, or an 8GB memory card. If you put in a larger capacity memory card in order to record more video for example, the camera would only recognize the recording time as being that of a 2GB card instead. In other words it wouldn't record any more than the alloted time before it thought the memory card was full, which of course it wasn't. Finally, the battery will only charge when the camera is plugged into a USB port. The battery doesn't come with a separate charger. This can become a huge problem should you forget to plug your camera into the computer. Thus you'll likely need to order yourself an extra battery with a wall charger like I did so you can be sure the battery won't die while you're out and about. In conclusion, I wouldn't recommend this camera. Unless someone is selling a new one for a huge discount, say 50% off, I would shop around for a non-Kodak digital camera instead......", "Date": "January 13, 2010"}, {"Title": "kodak M381  good compact camera", "Author": "etienned \"etienned\"", "ReviewID": "R22UJ1S0XE97I5", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Pretty good camera considering its size.

I sold a perfectly working Canon to get this camera.  I have now returned the camera due to Beach Camera Nice Return Policy and have chosen to pay a little bit more and keep the better camera.  Another issue was that the Date Stamp feature that Kodak uses only works on an individual basis.  You have to Date Stamp each picture, instead of it automatically doing it for you.
