{"Reviews": [{"Title": "A nice camera - fits right in between the Rebel series and 7D", "Author": "C. Tipton", "ReviewID": "R2FW89RQCCZ49L", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "This addition to Canon's XXD line might initially seem like a minor downgrade to the previous XXD cameras, but several new capabilities actually help make this a nice, well-featured camera that will appeal to many people who don't get caught up in whether or not this is a better camera than it's predecessor. Canon certainly made this camera for the price point and was careful to add just enough features to make it desirable over the T2i, but not desirable enough to compete with the 7D. In some respects though, it seems like a beefed-up version of the Rebel line (a \"Super-Rebel\") instead of a new addition to the XXD line.As someone who has now had the opportunity to use all three of Canon's mid-range lineup (the T2i, 60D, and 7D), I have to say that I really like the feel of the 60D. Even though it no longer has the magnesium alloy body, it feels solid. In no way does it feel cheap. I have fairly small hands and the 60D feels like it was made for me. It's significantly lighter than the 7D and feels like it would be much more friendly on long hikes. The 7D feels much more robust; however, the 60D feels much more \"comfy\". It is definitely bigger in size than the T2i, but the angles and design of the camera have a nicely updated feel to them that makes it seem like you are getting a much more substantial camera. The articulating screen was also done very well. My initial worries that the screen would feel cheap and break easily were immediately relieved after using it. The hinges are very solid and feel almost stiff to the point where you are comfortable with it staying right where you want it. It also is very flush with the rest of the body and offers little space in between.Aside from the feel, the camera takes beautiful pictures. Quality-wise, there is very little difference between the pictures that come out of the T2i, 60D, and 7D. ISO performance is very similar and therefore can not be much of a deciding factor between the models. Most of the decision factors really will focus on which user interface and camera system best appeals to your type and level of photography. Each of Canon's mid-range models has it's own pros and cons, and while there are MANY differences between each camera, these are the main points I considered when deciding between cameras to purchase (hopefully it helps those going through the same decision I did):60D vs. 50D:(+) New Sensor - the same 18MP sensor that the 7D and T2i have, better ISO coverage/performance(+) 63 zone dual-layer metering(+) Better viewfinder - 96% coverage vs 95% coverage(+) Video(+) Articulating screen(+) Wireless flash control(+) Horizontal electronic level(+) In camera processing (new RAW processing feature and in camera filter effects)(+) Control over max auto-ISO(+) Eye-Fi wifi file transfer functions(-) The magnesium alloy body of the 50D has been replaced with a polycarbonate body(-) 6.3 fps shooting is down to 5.3 fps(-) No lens microadjustment in 60D(+/-) Compact flash card slot has been changed to a SD card slot(+/-) Joystick replaced by directional pad60D vs. T2i(+) 9 all cross-type AF points vs T2i's 9 points w/ 1 center cross-type(+) 96%, .95 magnification pentaprism viewfinder vs T2i's 95%, .87 magnification pentamirror viewfinder(+) Articulating screen(+) Wireless flash control(+) Horizontal electronic level(+) In camera processing (new RAW processing feature and in camera filter effects)(+) Top LCD screen(+) 5.3 fps vs 3.7 fps(+) Built in adjustable audio level capability in video60D vs. 7D(+) Articulating screen(+) In camera processing (new RAW processing feature and in camera filter effects)(+) Control over max auto-ISO(+) Eye-Fi wifi file transfer functions(+) Built in adjustable audio level capability in video(-) 9 all cross-type AF points vs 7D's 19 all cross-type points(-) Less AF features (such as Zone AF and Point Expansion)(-) Polycarbonate body vs 7D's magnesium alloy(-) 96%, .95 magnification pentaprism viewfinder vs 7D's 100%, 1.0x magnification pentaprism viewfinder(-) Transmissive LCD screen on focus screen on 7D(-) Only horizontal electronic level vs both horizontal and vertical level on 7D(-) 5.3 fps vs 7D's 8 fps(-) No lens microadjustment in 60D(-) Shutter life of 100,000 vs 7D's 150,000(-) Dual DIGIC 4 processors in 7D(-) 3 custom settings in 7D; 1 custom settings in 60D(-) No PC Sync in 60DBy comparing these features, it's easy to see that the 60D fits well in the price point directly between the T2i and 7D, but of course, a large segment of previous 40D and 50D owners hoping for a true successor that isn't watered down to a certain price point will still undoubtedly be disappointed. It's easy to see in comparing the 60D to the 7D and also to Nikon's newest offerings that Canon chose to limit functionality merely so that 60D sales didn't interfere with the 7D. In fact, if you are not completely entrenched in the Canon camp, I would also suggest looking at the new Nikon D7000. It looks like a spectacular camera for not much more than the 60D. I have not used it nor will I, so I can't comment on whether it's a better choice or not.Even so, the quality of the 60D and new functionality offer enough new aspects that many customers will surely be happy with it. The articulating screen offers a way to attain tough shots that would have previously demanded extra equipment or odd contortions to reach. It also gives a great new avenue for video capture. Eye-fi wireless transfers work well and help out on those lazy days where you just want to set your camera down and have the work of transferring photos be done for you. Much of the in camera post-production comes off as being a little \"gimmicky\" to me, but having the option to add effects and process photos definitely doesn't detract from the camera. And many people who don't do much of their own post-processing after transfer to a computer will probably find the in camera RAW conversion and creative effects to be a nice addition.To me, it really came down to one major factor though: autofocus. I tend to do a lot of shooting involving fast moving subjects, so autofocus for my photography is key. The T1i and T2i were disappointing in this respect. 9 points with one cross-type in the T1i/T2i is respectable, but I found that I really could only rely on using the center point in AI servo mode to get many speedy subjects in focus. I purchased a 7D later, and was blown away by the accuracy. The options of using extra points for expansion, using autofocus zones, having 19 full cross-type points, superior subject tracking, and even the option for narrowing the points in spot autofocus really opened up new areas of photography for me. I get about 10x the amount of usable shots than I would with the T1i and T2i. The 60D isn't THAT good, but it is still much better than the T1i/T2i. In fact, just like with almost everything else about the camera, it's just about right in between the T2i and 7D. Autofocus is fast and accurate, but there are still moments where subjects just move too fast and unfortunately, the 60D doesn't have the capabilities of the 7D. If you are deciding between the 7D and 60D, this is the area you should really look at, because this is the real difference between the 2 cameras. I chose the 7D, and then decided to give the 60D a try just to see if I made the right decision. I am happy with my 7D, but the 60D was no slouch.In my honest opinion, I think this is a huge sticking point for 40D and 50D owners though. The autofocus system needed to be updated from the previous 2 XXD editions. It has the same 9 cross-type points as the 40D and 50D did before it, and same functionality. To be a good upgrade for previous XXD users, it didn't have to be as good or better than the 7D, but it would have been nice for it to be better than the previous 2 models. Removing the magnesium alloy body and lens microadjustment really comes across as a slap in the face to some users who valued those aspects. I have to say that the body is much lighter, doesn't feel significantly less sturdy (even though it probably is less sturdy), and I've never needed to use lens microadjustment though, so I'm not overly upset about those aspects. I am not thrilled about the \"non-update\" of the autofocus system though.Now that I have handled and used all 3 cameras currently in Canon's mid-range lineup, I can definitively say that they are all stellar cameras, but just made for different segments of the market. The T2i is an amazing starter camera and takes great photos for those who want to save a little extra money by going without some of the features they might not use. It might be the best budget option for those who don't take many action shots. For an extra few hundred dollars, the 60D adds some intriguing new features and seems to be aimed at the people who want a slightly higher-end camera than the T2i, but aren't ready to shell out the money for the 7D. It's a great compromise, and to me, the main thing you are missing out on is superior autofocus capabilities. The 7D is more aimed towards the pro-sumer market who want/need a faster autofocus and overall faster, more rugged camera. It's hard to go wrong with any of them, but the 60D offers a great blend of features from both the T2i and 7D along with new features of it's own for a price that won't completely break the bank. It seems to have accomplished everything it needed to do, except for one: giving the 40D and 50D owners an option for upgrade aside from the expensive 7D. If the 60D had kept the magnesium alloy body, lens microadjustment, or even just had a slightly better AF system compared to the 50D, I could easily give this camera 5 stars. As it is, I can only give it 4 stars because it's a wonderful camera for a certain segment of customers looking for a new camera, but completely isolates another loyal customer base looking for their beloved XXD line to continue.Update: With the release of the T4i, Canon's camera playing field has certainly changed. The minor changes to the T3i didn't warrant much more discussion on the 60D vs Rebel DSLR's than was already posted with the T2i, but the T4i brings some new interesting features to the table, puts picture quality and capture characteristics on par with the 60D, and in some respects ends up being a more appealing camera.Perhaps the most interesting new features on the T4i are that it now has autofocus during video while using Canon's new STM lenses and has a touchscreen display. For those who want or need autofocus while shooting video, this is a big selling point for the new Rebel instead of the 60D. Granted, it's not going to live up to the snappy autofocus you get when not using live-view mode or that when using specialized video camera's, but Canon did a great job with it over all. In my mind, it is a desirable feature to have access to even if you prefer to manual focus video most of the time.The T4i also upped the Rebel line's bar to include the 5 fps and 9 cross type autofocus points already found on the 60D.So back to the question at hand though: If you are choosing between the 60D and the T4i, which one do you go for? The 60D still has some major advantages in my opinion, and it really comes down to the better camera body of the 60D vs. the new video features of the T4i. With the 60D, you get the large dial on the back of the camera for rotating through images and selections and you also get the top LCD. The 60D still has a better, brighter viewfinder and can shoot at 1/8000 of a second opposed to the max 1/4000 of a second that the T4i can do. If those aspects don't concern you and you desperately want video autofocus, go for the T4i instead. It's a great camera. If, on the other hand, you would like a slightly more professional body and can live without video autofocus, the 60D is a great choice too. My personal choice still goes to the 7D if you can afford the upgrade though - the autofocus and 8 fps on it really put it in another level.", "Date": "September 20, 2010"}, {"Title": "Why Choose the 60D over the T2i or 7D?", "Author": "dojoklo", "ReviewID": "R12OZX5YUH3VIH", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "The three dSLRs in the Canon consumer line-up (60D, 7D, T2i) all share a number of specifications and features, a similar exposure metering system, as well as an image sensor that is very similar, and all with 18 megapixels.  Due to this, the image quality and ISO performance of these three cameras will be nearly identical, and all are capable of taking high quality images.  So why choose the 60D over the T2i (550D) or the 7D?-Exterior buttons and controls:  Greater ease and control of changing camera settings as you work vs. the T2i.  The 60D has nearly every control one needs on the exterior of the camera and it has the rear dial and top LCD display screen that are not on the T2i. Any other controls can be easily accessed with the Q button and menu or in the other menus on the rear LCD monitor. The top buttons of the 60D set only one setting each, so this is less complicated than the multiple-setting buttons of the 7D. Canon has removed the WB button that the 7D and 50D have, but that isn't a big deal - use the Q Menu. Another change is that the Multi-controller has been moved from the thumb joystick like the 7D and 50D and placed in the middle of the rear Quick-control dial. This doesn't change how it functions, and should just be a matter of getting used to the difference.-Menus and custom functions:  Greater control over customizing how the camera functions vs. the T2i.  The 60D has many more Menu and Custom Function settings than the T2i and nearly as many as the 7D. These settings allow you to customize the operation, function, and controls of the 60D to work how you want them to, including things like exposure increments, peripheral illuminations correction for lenses (fixes dark corners) and customizing which button does what.-Auto focus systems:  The 60D shares a similar autofocus system to the T2i and the previous 50D, with 9 focus points and three auto focusing modes. However the 9 AF points of the 60D are more sensitive than those of the T2i: all are cross-type in the 60D, only the center is cross-type in the T2i. The 60D autofocus system is much less complex than the sophisticated AF system of the 7D with its 19 AF point system and its additional Zone, Spot, and Expansion focus modes - not to mention the custom settings of the 7D which will allow one to customize how the AF system works. However, if you are not an avid sports photographer, a wildlife shooter, or someone who understands, needs, and will use the elaborate features of the 7D AF system, then this shouldn't dissuade you from the 60D.-Exposure Metering: The three cameras all share the latest 63-zone exposure metering system and 4 metering modes. That means they will all determine the exposure virtually identically and enable you to take properly exposed photos in most every situation, including difficult back-lit scenes. The size of the areas metered for Partial and Spot metering vary slightly between the cameras, but that isn't anything critical.-ISO:  Since the 60D shares a very similar sensor with the other two cameras, its ISO sensitivity and performance at high ISO settings is virtually the same. But don't take my word for it, don't be swayed by pixel peepers on forums, instead check out the camera sensor tests at dxomark to verify this.-Continuous Shooting Speed:  While the 60D can't shoot a blazing 8 frames per second like the 7D, it can shoot a respectable 5.3 fps which is generally a more useful rate, and is a higher rate than the T2i rate of 3 fps.-Size and Weight:  The 60D is larger and heavier than the T2i but smaller and lighter than the 7D. It is a very nice size, weight, feel, and design that should be comfortable for most users.-Construction:  The 60 has relatively strong construction of aluminum and polycarbonate. It is better built than the T2i but not as strong as the 7D's magnesium alloy frame. The 60D also has some amount of weather sealing - more than the T2i, less than the 7D. But for most users, including even those using the camera daily or in travel situations, the construction of the 60D is far more than good enough, strong enough, durable enough, and weather resistant enough.-Articulating Rear LCD Screen:  The 60D is the only current Canon dSLR with this handy feature.  This may prove useful for videographers, as well as for setting up compositions while the camera is on a tripod, for macro use, or for using it from unusually low or high vantage points.  There is also an electronic level, visible in the viewfinder, rear LCD, or top LCD.-Viewfinder:  The 60D has a large, bright viewfinder with 96% coverage of the actual resulting image, a tiny bit better than the T2i but not quite as nice as the nearly 100% view of the 7D.-Wireless Flash:  Like the 7D, the 60D incorporates wireless flash triggering. It allows you to trigger multiple off camera flashes at different output levels. The T2i does not have this feature.-Battery:  The 60D has a larger batter vs. the T2i, thus allowing longer periods of shooting before having to recharge. The 60D uses the LP-E6 battery like the 7D, which is a nice feature as this battery can often last through a full day of shooting.-Processor:  The 60D shares the same Digic 4 processor as the T2i. The 7D has dual Digic 4 processors. However, for most general or even demanding photography needs, the single processor is more than sufficient.-Memory Card: The 60D uses the SD memory card like the T2i, not the CF card of the 7D. This doesn't affect anything except perhaps your collection of CF cards.-Additional processing features:  The 60D has added features such as the creative filters (toy camera, miniature tilt-shift effect) and internal file processing capabilities (RAW image processing, image resizing) that the other two cameras do not have.  This is not critical as these operations can typically be more easily done in batches on a computer.-Lack of AF Microadjustment: Many are disappointed that the 60D does not include the ability to micro-adjust the focus so that each lens is completely accurate. However, if you have a focus issue, send your camera and/ or lenses to Canon while under warranty and ask them to calibrate them.  The 7D has this feature, the T2i does not.-Locking Mode Dial: This is a new feature for a Canon dSLR that keeps the Mode dial from accidentally rotating. A nice touch only on the 60D.-Full HD Video:  And of course the 60D has full HD video, just like the other two cameras.-A Note to Strobists: The 60D does not have a PC sync flash socket to plug in PC sync cords.  The 7D has this, the T2i does not.-Ease of operation:  While beginners may find all the buttons, controls, and menus of any dSLR difficult and confusing at first, the controls and menus of the 60D are all quite intelligently designed and straightforward for the advanced user.  If you'd like to get up and running with the 60D quickly and competently be sure to check out a PDF eBook I put together called Your World 60D on the \"Picturing Change\" blog or the Kindle version here: Your World 60D - The Photographer's Guide to Operation and Image Creation with the Canon 60D. It describes how to set up the Menu settings and Custom Function settings, and explains how, when, and why to use the settings, controls, and features of the 60D in everyday still photography use, including aperture priority and shutter priority modes.  Plus it has information on exposure, composition, using depth of field, and basic video settings. It should help you get the most out of the 60D.The 60D is an excellent camera for those wanting to upgrade from the Rebel line, for the advanced dSLR user who wishes to take advantage of all the features and customizations options of the 60D, and for the first-time dSLR buyer who is knowledgeable of camera controls or eager to learn.  Its size, durability, and features will suit those who wish to use it for both general use and for travel, and its image quality and performance is exceptional for a camera at this price.", "Date": "September 20, 2010"}, {"Title": "Solid Prosumer DSLR/Video Camera", "Author": "Larry L", "ReviewID": "R2OJP9U6VZXWKC", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I've taken photos and video most of my life, now I am the typical father paparazzi, my subjects are my family, with some nature landscapes and city architecture mixed in.First this camera replaced my original capture the moment kit, which included a Nikon D80 DLSR and a Samsung HD-1010 Digital Video Camera.  I sold them both after owning this for a week.  They are simply not needed anymore.  It's very nice to be able to go to my kid's soccer games and not look like I am bringing a production crew. One camera for killer photos and video.  I use this camera 70/30 photos/video, and it is just a pleasure to work with.What I like for photography:Excellent pictures - Even with the stock 18-135 lens, solid photos, great details, and very very crop-able.  Yes this is not an L Lens but it is still very goodLow light performance - The ISO high iso speeds work well when you can't use a flash, there is still some noise but its manageable, the default setting for upper end iso is 3200, so that tells you how confident Canon is with its camera's ability to handle noise.Solid camera (my friend has the 7D, there is a difference when handling them, but not much, all the talk of metal vs. plastic frame I think is overrated)Very fast focus, yes its not the 32 point next gen autofocus, but in all my tests when not using live view it does just fine transitioning between focus points.Fast shooting speed almost 6 fps is very good, and thought 3 fps was good. (I also like the 2 settings for shooting speed, normal and high speed)Built in Wireless flash control.  I also bought the 430EX II, and 3 button pushes later I had the speed light firing while it sat off camera behind the subject, and that is very coolGreat Canon Software (I use a Mac, and I love the USB interface software, you can completely control the camera from your computerCustom Shooting mode - Exact what it sounds like, its nice touchThe flip out rotating screen is very sharp, probably one of the best I've seen on a DSLR.  I don't shoot much live view though.It uses SD, only because I had plenty of SD cards from my last two devices.What I don't like photography:The lock button on the mode selector, it turns changing the shoot mode into a 2 handed operationThe lack of dedicated buttons - I know they had to save space when they added the vari-screen, but I liked having quick one touch access to bracketing on my NikonThis isn't a \"don't like\" it's more \"I could do without\"  all the preset modes on the wheel.  People who are going to spend $1000+ on a camera most likely don't need a preset called landscape or portrait. Maybe they were trying to fill the space on the wheel?Also all this hupla about in camera processing and special effects, it seems a bit gimmicky to me.  I have a plenty of Macs with big beautiful screens to do this, heck I could do it with an iPad now if I really wanted to.  I can't see someone trying to color correct on the camera especially since it's not like you could transmit the edited  file directly from the camera, it still has to go through a computer somewhere along the line.  These might be useful if my camera came with built-in 3G or something, otherwise not so much.What I like video:Video performance is excellent, head over to vimeo.com and look at all the sample footage, it is just astounding.  I've experimented with the 50/1.8 lens and wow the DoF is crisp in the video.  You would need some expensive lens adapters to get these results with a camcorder.The flip out screen!  This is main reason I bought this camera, It never made sense to me how I could shoot proper video without those expensive view finder liveview converter things. Plus I thought they looked silly.  Now with this, I hold the camera at just above waist level close to my body with the screen flipped out and up, it makes for stable video and relatively easy manual focus if you want to use it.Manual controls are also very useful for video, you can control everything from the image to the audio via manual controlsWhat I don't like video:Noise at high ISO - With the stock lens 18-135 IS I do not recommend low light shooting, it will work, but its very noisy - just like photography better lenes with lower F-stops = better output.Autofocus is a bit slow (I try not use the autofocus when actually recording, I usually shoot video with manual focus, its not that hard when you get the hang of it)So that's it, a solid DSLR with a solid video camera built in, I would recommend this camera to people like me, who understand and love photography and also love shooting video.  People who can use manual controls but you don't mind throwing it in program mode for the quick shots and you can't justify spending the extra money on a 7D.  I am very very happy with this camera!", "Date": "October 5, 2010"}, {"Title": "60D is very good, despite all the hate it gets. 60D is a worthy xxD member.", "Author": "estse", "ReviewID": "RGAMHGJZMKFJB", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Quick 1-sentence review: The 60D's image quality (IQ), features and ergonomics are just as good as the 7D that will undoubtly stay in kit for a long time.Background:I come from an entry-level DSLR background and have never owned anything about the Rebel Series. However, I have played with my friend's 40Ds, 50D's, 7D's, 5D's and 5dMkII's a lot. My style is a photo journalistic style, where I follow people and take candid pictures or posed pictures. I take pictures of children and at times, just still subjects like food products or decorations. I have previously taken a lot of photos from my old Canon S400 and SD800IS point and shoot cameras. My XSi was and still is a wonderful camera. I still find myself bringing the XSi for trips, so I don't have to worry too much about the body. I've probably taken at least 20,000 pictures on it already. I have done some event photography as well for friends or friends of friends.I was hesitant to purchase the 60D because of all the flak and hate people were throwing at it. Some of the complaints I heard were:(-) A Polycarbonate aluminum chassis - a downgrade from the Magnesium alloy(-) 5.3 fps - decreased from 6.3fps(-) lack of lens microadjustment - only the 50D had this in the xxD line as I recall.(-) SD cards - used to use CF cards(-) Bad product direction seen in the xxD line - Seems like they are going to dumb it down for noobs.I'll try to address these separately, but won't go really deep in them.Polycarbonate Aluminum ChassisThe change back to a \"Plastic\" casing has quickly gotten the label of being cheap, less-durable and unprofessional. Cheap, it does seem cheaper, I will agree with that. Metal is more expensive. Less-durable? I don't know about this. Plastics nowadays are so strong that could withstand a good fall on the floor, water damage and maybe even some fire. [...]. In my hand, the 60D feels very comfortable. It has weight and heft to not make it feel like a smaller cheaper camera. The feel is important here, because this is what you are feeling when you grip your hand to shoot photos. I think the 60D is almost at the borderline of being just large enough to fit fully and comfortably in one hand, meaning, don't be smaller than the 60D in the future or else it might as well be a Rebel. As for being unprofessional. This is the one that I find that ego and pride get in the way of logic making it irrational. No one in their right mind is going to say you are unprofessional just because it isn't build like a tank. How often are you going to drop your camera? I bet less than you drop your phone by a long shot. The only impact I get from my camera is knocking into walls or tables. It doesn't do a thing. Thus, watch the video on durability on the plastics even on the Rebel series that I have already put a link to in this paragraph.5.3fps - Slower than 6.3This one is the case of losing something that has been in the xxD line for 2 generations. The 40D had 6.5fps, the 50D had 6.3fps. Now the 60D is only 5.3fps. I see how people are disgruntled here. Losing that extra frame sucks. I won't argue that maybe that extra frame could have been the right frame. In some way, this is an argument of numbers. Mind you, if a photographer wanted to do some highspeed photography like sports, they probably wouldn't have looked at the xxD line of products anyway. The would have looked at the xD (1Ds or 7Ds). Oh, also, did you notice that the 5Dmkii only has 3.9 fps? That is a professional Full Frame camera. Do people complain? yes they do. Should you worry about it? I don't think so. Some people (not all people) just like to see higher fps numbers, but almost never use it. And when they do use it, it isn't going to be the life saver they may think it is. I had shot with my 3.5 fps with the XSi and that was very good already. It is more about photography technique, and not the numbers and capabilities of the camera. So is it a huge loss of 1fps? Not a huge loss. I agree that is sucks and is a downside, but it is not a deal breaker at all.Lack of lens microadjustmentLike the previous 5.3fps argument. This one is more of a case of been given something and then taken away right away. Only the 50D had this function. The 40D didn't have the Lens microadjustment. Once again, it would be nice to have when you need it for sure. But once again, is it necessary to take good shots? No it isn't. People can still take wonderful shots with the 30D or 40D and they didn't have this functionality. When it is needed though, it is super helpful to adjust the lens for the body. Most of the time, you won't have to worry about this. If you really really need it done, get the lens calibrated, hopefully that helps.SD cards coming from CF cards for xxD lineSome will like and some will hate. Personally, I like this approach for Canon. SD cards, are smaller, cheaper but not as fast. But what I love about having SD cards is that i don't have to carry an extra card reader to transfer to my laptop. All new laptops have SD card slots, so I never have to worry about forgetting a card reader. The SD card in the xxD line also helps reduce a small amount of bulk on the side of the camera. Sure the writing speeds aren't as good, but the future is looking great for SD cards and SDXC. If I had to choose to carry SD cards or CF cards around on a trip or event, SD cards. I can just keep them in my pocket and never have to worry about the pins inside the camera from becoming bent and damaged.Bad product direction for the xxD lineThis is where a lot of other arguments get merged into. Because the xxD is now in between the xxxD and xD line (Rebel and 7D line of products), it has to be able to make itself distinct enough to be deemed a separate line of family. It has to take the some of the good features from both lines and bring them together and also add new things to it to make it useful. Is the xxD line going in the wrong direction? I don't know actually, this is the first time the xxD line has been quite different from the previous generation, aka the 50D. What many don't realize is that the 60D has gained some really good characteristics from the 7D, namely the wireless flash control. Thank goodness for this. But at the same time, lost the PC sync. Hmm, maybe Canon has something else planned for the future of this wireless flash control that would make the PC sync obsolete in the future? We don't know. Many people attribute the 18MP sensor to the T2i. But please remind yourself that the 18MP sensor came from the 7D. So instead of \"losing\" to the T2i. The xxD line has gained from the 7D line. Same goes with the 63-zone metering system, it is more gained from the 7D and then put into the 60D. Video capability from the 7D, which is also shared by the T2i. Horizontal Electronic Level, this is useful for tripod shots or even some hand held. But I see the value for the tripod just as a final check.The increase of the Auto modes is kind of stupid. I know why Canon might have put it in, but it would have been way better to just remove it altogether. Video mode should have been put on the creative auto portion of the mode dial with M, Av and Tv. It really is a pain to move there. Speaking of mode dial, this is one that many people are very split on. I really like it. When I was using the XSi, I was consistently changing the mode without realizing until I after I had taken the shot. And the mode dial wasn't even hanging out on the side of the camera. So the locking mechanism for the mode dial is something I like in the 60D and new to the xxD line.I don't blame people for being very demanding and have high expectations of cameras from Canon, but one should be reasonable. It would be very unlikely that the 60D would gain a ton of features from the 7D. If it did, the 7D would instead be the one that could not be distinct. I believe that if the 7D came out, then the 60D then the T2i, the complaints would be different. I could even foresee people complain if the order of release was T2i, 60D and 7D, with the same features set. I can see how people would argue differently and maybe have praised the 60D. To me, the 60D is just an evolution of the product line and not a revolution like the 40D was to the 30D. Does it make it a bad product? Not at all. It takes marginally better pictures than the 50D and is at least at par with the 7D and T2i. Oh one more thing I really like in this new product line. They use the same LP-E6 batteries as 7D and 5Dmkii. YAY!!! I can share batteries with my friends. This is great because more commonality between these lines is not a burden, but a great plus.D7000 vs 60D battle (not a war) is like a battle of pride with no substance.Another BIG BIG argument in the world of DSLRs now is the whole D7000 vs 60D argument. Many people love this argument because it is time for Nikon fans (not going to say they are fanboys, because I know there are some Canon fanboys too) to really blow their horns and tout superiority by numbers. Once again, I'll repeat, superiority by numbers. Why do mention this? It is because people allow numbers, specs and math to determine why they like a camera or system. Some people will argue that because the D7000 is a better specced camera, therefore, by transitivity, the D7000 will take better pictures by a long shot. What do the results show? Marginally better, is the probably the common thing noticed if anything is ever noticed between the photos. The D7000 has everything the 60D doesn't have and improves on it is another one I have heard several times that have caused Canon users to think, \"Oh Nikon has a wonderful D7000, I think it is time to jump boat\". I won't prevent them from doing so. But this argument is similar to that of girlfriends almost. Oh, that girlfriend has better \"specs\" that my current one, I think I will just dump this \"system\" and go to the Nikon. The word I would use to describe this is \"Brand\" insecurity. It isn't wrong to change systems. But the reasoning behind it needs to be thought over. I am afraid that some people are just insecure about their purchase that they need to be able to walk around town, events or show others to match the level of pride they have.Back to this D7000 and 60D battle. Who is going to win? I actually wouldn't look it in that way. I would say, the D7000 and the 60D are both wonderful systems and both have proven to take wonderful pictures, hold up to weather effects, is durable (mind you, D7000 has magnesium alloy, but it isn't the entire body, only partial, its marketing getting to your head.), great ergonomics, has video capability, etc. There isn't a battle at all actually. It is just a bunch nerd battles like D&D; with their character sheets. My camera has more strength and dexterity while the Canon has more charisma and constitution. See how irrelevant this argument and so called battle is? It is down to numbers and pride. The seaweed is always greener, in somebody else's lake.Oh. Let's also put it this way. As I had mentioned about the order of being released. If the order of release was like 7D, 60D and T2i (equivalent) for the Nikon camp, the story and arguments would be just like canon's. D400, then D7000 and lastly D5000. People would have said, why doesn't the D7000 act more like the D400. That is my point.The actual review of the 60D without trying to compare too much.I have had the 60D for 2.5 weeks and have taken some videos and pictures with it at some events and some portraits. Some at low ISO and some at high ISO (3200 and 6400). Compared to the XSi, the pictures were better, but not immensely better. What was more important was the technique in taking the photo that made more of a difference. The 60D, with its better size and ergonomics (compared to Rebel series) really helped me to keep my hands steady and to choose the properly settings to get the pictures looking really nice without any post processing. I have used the remote flash trigger with great results and I really really like the camera. The price point now is just amazing for the 60D. And when the camera is put with the 24-70mm f2.8 and 50mm f1.4, the images are loved by all who I take a photo for. Is it because the camera that made the huge difference? No. But it did help me as a photographer to take better pictures.The better photos at high ISO is attributed to Canon's research in sensors that they have put into the 7D. The images continue to look great even at high ISO. The articulated screen helps me take ninja candid shots without people noticing and that is something I wouldn't be able to get in T2i or the 7D. Some clients love this type of photography even though they don't like to be taken pictures of. I don't have to worry too much about the high ISO when taking these shots now as I can trust the 60D to resolve good photos in the end as long as I did my part as a photographer to keep the camera steady.The price point of the camera with such good features is actually great. At $999 at the time of posting, is the even cheaper than the 50D when it came out. So if you are in the area and are looking to get th 60D, buy it, because you won't be disappointed as long as you don't feel insecure. The camera takes absolutely wonderful pictures indoor and outdoor. Videos are good and the same as the 7D and T2i. It is rugged, as mentioned by digital rev. I can't say much more to praise the camera. Buy it, don't look back and take photos. You by a camera to shoot photos, not so you can bring it to a party and compare specs and see who is better? Canon 60D, 4 stars, 1 star left so they can improve.", "Date": "November 5, 2010"}, {"Title": "Know thyself", "Author": "Amazon Customer", "ReviewID": "RVZW7YFGLHZR5", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I'm in love with photography in general. I always have a camera with me and started shooting when I was seven years old. Nature, scenics, portraits, anything that is beautiful or touches me in some unexpected and magical way ends up in my camera. Along the way people noticed my pictures, asked me to take them for their special events, and since then I've been shooting portraits and weddings mostly for the sheer joy of it, having the good fortune of a day job that pays the bills.For years I was committed to Olympus, and had a complete two camera, two wireless flash outfit with quite a few of their high grade lenses. But Olympus' recent focus on micro four thirds, a form factor that I cannot stomach and will therefore never own, their continued mediocre low light performance compared to APS-C sensors, and their announcement to the effect that they will not pursue any more mid-level 4/3rds camera bodies, pushed me over the edge and I started looking elsewhere.So I went to a few camera stores and handled many different models.I do not buy pro bodies, since I don't need anything that rugged and would rather buy the same sensor in a cheaper camera and spend the money an top-quality glass and flash units. I only had one pro body in my life, a Nikon F series back in ye olde film days, and it was also the ONLY camera that ever failed outright , something that dozens of cheaper Minolta, Pentax and Olympus cameras have not once done, even after having been handled rougher than the Nikon ever was. That was a lesson I haven't forgotten, and I've since not bought a pro body OR a Nikon ever again.I'm not going to let the AF select what to focus on, so even a 2,000 - point sensor won't excite me. I just need one good, reliable, fast focus point in the middle, and then I do the old \"lock focus and AE and recompose\" routine which takes no time at all, certainly less than selecting an alternate focus point. The 60D has nicely lit, unobtrusive focus points, not the garish, semi-permanent black rectangles of the 7D. The focus is absolutely accurate and I have had hundreds of wonderful, sharp pictures in the month I've owned the camera.I take the occasional picture and video from odd angles, so the articulating monitor - which is a thing of beauty, firm and solid and gorgeously clear - is wonderful for me. Again, a perfect \"10\" for the 60D.I don't need 7 or 8 fps since I rarely shoot sporting events or wildlife that moves THAT fast. When I do, the 60D's 5.3 fps have so far been more than enough.The out-of-camera JPEG's are great. I don't for a moment deny the usefulness of RAW, but again, I'd rather be out shooting pictures than post processing in the computer. The 60D gives me consistently pleasing, well exposed photos IF I've taken the time to adjust the metering and white balance according to the situation at hand. Auto white balance is fairly accurate but manual tweaking always renders better results, regardless of which camera one uses.The viewfinder, especially coming from the 4/3rd format, is brilliantly bright and clear and easy to compose shots in even with glasses. I can see all the information and all of the screen.The top deck controls are much better, in my own humble opinion and for my own personal use, than the dual-function buttons of the more advanced 7D, which I was initially set on buying before those same buttons turned me off. I want one button to do one thing, period. I enjoy photography, not rote memorization of multiple button press functions.The grip and the texture are wonderful, for someone who when shopping for gloves usually gets the XL sizes. The controls are grouped sensibly, the menu structure is instantly recognizable even though I've never owned a Canon DSLR before, and it just makes sense.Battery life is so good that this may just be the first camera where I can make it through an average day/shoot without having to worry about spares. Mind you, I do 90% stills and 10% video, and of the stills less than 5% are live view. So far, the claimed battery life of 1,000 plus shots seems entirely realistic. I've shot for several days and taken hundreds of images and it's not even half empty yet. WOW!The built-in flash is excellent. It is more powerful and exposes subjects spot on at a much higher percentage of the time than I am used to seeing. Remember that if you're shooting in P/Tv/Av/M , you need to manually adjust the metering area, or you'll have some unexpected over or -underexposure. Which leads me to the intuitiveness of the Quick menu on the back panel, where things such as flash compensation can be quickly adjusted, a feature that I believe Olympus first introduced on the Evolt 500. I was very glad to find it here. Even so, next on my shopping list is one of the wonderful Speedlight units.The thing I was most worried about when making the switch was whether I was going from a company with excellent high-grade lenses ( Olympus ) to one where all but the \"L\" series lenses were mediocre. I needn't have worried. I see no discernible difference between the vaunted Olympus high-grade glass I own and the 18-135 Canon IS lens, in most day to day shooting. Any differences there are won't be visible with the most minimal cropping in prints. I will, soon, add the 10-22 EF-S for wide angle shots, and trust it will also perform admirably.When all is said and done, if you know yourself well enough to know what you realistically will do with a camera, and what  the bare minimum requirements of a camera should be to allow you to do so without having to worry whether you're pushing the envelope, than you'll know if this camera is right for you.The 60D just feels as if it is part of me. I understand it, and it does not get in the way of my taking the pictures I want to take. To me, that's what an excellent camera is all about.", "Date": "November 6, 2010"}, {"Title": "Great first dslr - one issue though", "Author": "Rob Guffanti", "ReviewID": "RL0VKUFV8WRG7", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "This is a fantastic camera, and a great first DSLR. I say that because if it is your first, you will not be comparing the control layout with your old XXD or XXXD, and that seems to be an issue with some.Most of my shooting is in M or Av mode. I find the controls easy to work with, and use the top LED and control buttons almost exclusively, but now and then I'll use the q-menu. Over all, I find the controls easy to use.The 18-200 kit lens is useful for outdoor shooting, but for indoor stuff you will want a better prime. I went with an older version of the \"nifty fifty\" with the metal mount and range meter. Since this is a crop sensor camera, a 50mm lens behaves like an 80mm, so I find myself needing to back away from my subject often. I think a prime in the 20-30mm range and f/1.4 would be useful in a lot of situations. In general, you should determine why you are buying the camera. If you want to take lots of outdoor shots (birds, wildlife etc) get the body only and buy a nice 300M zoom. If you are going to take lots of indoor shots (family gatherings, baby etc) get the body only and a wide aperture prime in the 20-50MM range (a wide aperture lets more light in so you don't need a flash as often, and yields that nice soft focus \"bokeh\" effect). If you want to be ready to shoot a variety of situations right out of the box and don't mind using the flash indoors, then pick a kit lens and go with it. I would not recommend the 18-55 kit lens though...you will bump against its limitations very quickly, even if you are a beginner like me.Video on this thing is amazing, and I didn't even consider that when I bought the camera! Beware file size though. 2 minutes of 1080 @ 30FPS left me with an 800+meg .mov file. I think there is a 4 GB limit on video file size, so figure you will get 5 minutes of continuous shooting at that definition and frame rate. That will be enough for most applications, unless you are filming a wedding or childbirth and don't want to stop shooting, in which case you could film at 720p or standard definition.Playback through the included cable is so so, so get yourself a mini HDMI to HDMI cable on Amazon or Monoprice (should cost $5-$10) and prepare yourself to be amazed by the resolution and image quality. I would also recommend a program called Any Video Converter, which enables you to change the resolution and format of your video to suit different hardware (iphones, droids, youtube etc). Imagine uploading a 4GB file to YouTube, for example. You can download the program for free, and then pay $40 bucks to be able to use the full menu set.The only negative about this camera is that the auto focus in video mode and live view mode is borderline useless. In live view mode, it is so slow that everyone else would have got the shot with their point and shoot cameras before the 60D settles down and takes the picture. As for Video, I don't think AF works once you start shooting, so if you zoom or your subject moves, you have to stay on top of it. I don't shoot in live view mode and I am getting the hang of manual focus during Video (it is actually a creative outlet) so I'm fine with these shortcomings. From what I can tell, they are software based and related to the video codec...so it is possible that a firmware upgrade will address these issues.", "Date": "April 6, 2011"}, {"Title": "I Like This Camera More Every Day After Loving It From Day One.", "Author": "J. Kirlin", "ReviewID": "R11QSAZ3T0N77L", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This review isn't a listing of all the features of this camera.  You've just scrolled past those.  But it's my impression of the ones that make the most difference and to compare it with my prior experiences.  Anyone who knows Canon will know it's better than the T2i and not as good as the 7D which is what the comparative reviews are saying.This is my 1st XXD series camera so many of my comments are going to be based on my past experiences with the Canon Powershot S series (Of which this camera is a love child) and my experiences with my 3 Rebels (XTi, XSi, and T1i which I always carry).  This product will not be purchase verified or whatever that is called because I have WAITED for Amazon.com to sell this kit but my local retailer came out with it first.Why does it take this many years to get a camera with an articulated LCD?  Nikon offered this a year or so ago on the entry level Nikon d5000 DSLR much the same way Nikon had to force Canon to give Canon users Image Stabilization on the entry level lenses only after Nikon started to offer it's VR system on it's entry level lenses.  CANON!  STOP LETTING NIKON DICTATE YOUR CAMERA DEVELOPMENT!  DO IT FOR US!  Like us!  Please?  Just a little??  The variangle LCD was the strength of the Canon point and shoots, particularly of the Canon PowerShot S series, whose users will possibly be this camera's biggest fans.  The best thing about this window is that you can protect the screen from scratches and although Canon claims it will help you get shots from other angels and enhance the live view, it's still slightly more awkward to use than on the Powershot series because you could one zoom one handed with the switch, instead to having to manually twist the lens.The electronic levels is REALLY great and though images can be straightened in post processing, it helps to have the level.  Again, this will make a little more sense of the softball shaped rebels which are harder to FEEL level,  this larger 60D almost feels self leveling with its nice size and great grip.  I never minded the grip on the Rebels but now that I see the difference I'm slightly less satisfied with those and feel this is far superior.  But all the XXD series have this.This camera is also surprisingly light compared to the 50D which means its also surprisingly plastic.  I don't mind plastic.  I don't want to carry around a bunch of have metal framed cameras for the one time I need it to defelct a bullet.  If I am finally getting shot at for taking photos someplace I'm not supposed to be, maybe it's my time.  I like the weight and feel of this.In camera processing has already been mocked by my friends and as much as I like it, it seems like a silly thing to put on the XXD series.  It will seem less so on the Canon T3i, as will the variangle window.  Maybe one day I will be processing all my photos in camera, why, I have no idea, but why not just give us that software on a disk?  Maybe they have.  I haven't checked the disk yet.  If they have?  Awesome.  If not, Canon why do you still hate us so??  For that matter, why can't Canon put some cool Hipstamatic-like software in there?  It works on a damned phone and costs 99 cents.It has a 49 shot buffer which I am BARELY able to big down even at the highest burst mode settings.  NICELY DONE, Canon.The battery life is spectacular and this kit lens, the Canon 18-135 1:3.5-5.6 IS is a REALLY, REALLY great lens which is going to be vilified because it's the kit lens. I also really liked the 18-55 IS. (KIT SNOBS!)  As anyone who has tried to replace the 18mm wide end of the range with a different lens, you will have seen that it isn't cheap, Ringo.  Do not let kit lens snobs, or Canon, ruin your love for this lens.  It's that same cheap plasticy built as the old kits and the 55-250 (another great lens).  You can read the reviews for this lens on its own page and you can see how highly it is rated by other users if not by people who do nothing but photograph grids all day.  This lens does not have a zoom lock but neither did that monstrous Canon 28-135 which slides open as soon as it falls below horizonal, but the 18-135 stays put.The XXD series has the faster shutterspeed of 1/8000 which will allow me to use the Canon 50 1.8 outdoors without a ND filter (which works but makes it harder to see out the viewfinder) OR if you accidentally leave it in the nearly noise free iso1600 you can now still get great shots.  Same as the 50D but stilla  step up from the Rebel's 1/4000 limit.I can't speak for the video because I have barely used it on my T1i or on this camera.  I'm sure it may be great but I don't use it.  I found myself having the same difficult as using the variangle window, in that it takes the other hand to zoom and that shakes the camera and although Canon seemed to indicate someplace that it was for 'moving stills' or something like that, I'd have gladly passed up this feature for a couple hundred bucks off.  Isn't a FLIP HD camera like a hundred bucks or something?So to sum it up, if my biggest complaint with this camera is that Canon has made us wait for some really great features then they have done a great job.  The price point is fair.I will update this review with edits the second I find fault with this camera under this line but as yet, have not found any.Update: No complaints but I do have additional praise.  This Canon has 2 burst mode settings a high and a low.  ESSENTIAL when shooting people and very nice to have it adjustable.The Live View has a greatly improved autofocus now which makes shooting from the hip with the very large variangle window REALLY great.  I appreciate it more already then when I mentioned it at the beginning of this review.This camera is also an ergonomic dream, the buttons feel great.  I have small hands and have always resisted the XXD series thinking It would be a nuisance to hold it and operate the buttons.  Canon really did a great job with this design.  The buttons are well places and DEEP so you KNOW you are pressing them, not just tapping a little nub.  I'm increasingly pleased every time I use this camera.I took this camera to New York this weekend.  At over 1800 (no flash) shots the battery still held 62% of it's charge.  FAR in excess of Canon's reported specs.  You will have a hard time draining this battery in 2 days of shooting.If I had not already bought this camera, I would have bought it again.", "Date": "September 25, 2010"}, {"Title": "60D flaw which Canon needs to fix", "Author": "Michael Everett", "ReviewID": "R5ZYCE9SVRI1T", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "This is a great state of the art camera with one major flaw. There appears to be a conflict between the hot shoe and the built-in flash. The hot shoe may be erroneously reporting to the built-in flash that an external flash is still mounted on the hot shoe. The bottom line is, there's no way to open the built-in flash. Google something like <canon 60D built-in flash problem> and you'll find an avalanche of 60D owners trying to figure out how to open and use their built-in flash. Many report fixing the problem by probing the tiny leaf springs beneath the hot shoe rails. I tried it, but not to vigorously because I was reluctant to possibly damage the two springs.In an email from Canon they had me run through every routine they could think of in hopes of resetting the camera. None of this worked so today I UPS'd the camera to Canon. It was $8 to ship to Canon 56 miles away and about $25 for $1100 in insurance. That's a total of $33.00 and your warranty won't cover it.Judging from various forums, the 7D has a similar problem.The 60d is a great camera, but Canon needs to wake up and pay more attention to engineering or they'll start losing market-share in DSLR's.", "Date": "May 13, 2011"}, {"Title": "Super Rebel?", "Author": "Robert L. Taylor \"SaltyBob\"", "ReviewID": "R1GU479QFI7EG3", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "All the Canon XXD camera reviews quickly devolve into a criticism of the compromises Canon makes for the price point and the intended market.  The 60D is no exception, perhaps more so with the 60D. I recall all the bad press and angry reviews the 50D and even the 40D got when they first came out, always whining about missing features, arguments over the pixel count, is it a real semi-pro camera or not, etc.  It's a tough spot to satisfy a tough crowd.  Clearly Canon is repositioning the XXD line with the 60D.  This line of Cameras has always been in an odd space, stuck between the Rebels and higher end Pro Cameras.  It appeals to those that want a pro camera but don't want to spend the money to get a real pro camera like the 5 or 1 Series cameras and those that wouldn't be caught dead with a lowly Rebel, the camera snobs. This crowd often wants more than it is paying for.Perhaps it will help to compare what you get to a Rebel to see how Canon is positioning this Camera.- For starters it is a larger more ergonomic body, a pleasure to hold and use.  The Rebels were always too small for me, especially the grip.  The 60D has a larger grip that feels much nicer in your hands.  It is poly carbonate over metal but still feels strong and sturdy although I'm not willing to try it with mine it feels like it will take some knocks pretty well, it's not cheap feeling like some of the Rebels.  Try it you may find you really like it.- It has a built in flash transmitter, I've already use this s couple of times, you won't find this on any Rebel, it's cool and useful.- Better metering, it now uses color to help meter exposure not just luminance, this will give a more accurate reading and better exposure especially in scenes with bright reds; you won't find this on any Rebel.- Same 9 point focus system, but they are all cross type which are more sensitive than the older 9 point system that only had the center as a cross type.  Now better than any Rebel.- Shutter to 1/8000 sec vs. 1/4000 sec for the Rebels- Better battery life, the 60D's uses the same battery as the 7D and 5D 2, giving you about twice the battery life of a Rebel, tell me you don't want that.- Flash Sync at 1/250th vs. 1/200 for the Rebel.- Built in horizontal level, not on any Rebel, great for landscape shooters.- 5.3 FPS vs. 3.7 FPS.  OK this is down from the old 50D's 6.3, although the 50D never really did shoot as fast as advertised whereas the 60D does, the difference between the two cameras is really only about .8 FPS, still far better than any Rebel. It also has a high and low speed continuous shooting rate, nice to have that option, the Rebels are not fast enough for this to make any sense.- Articulating screen: the only Canon DSLR that has it and it is a wonderful addition and very useful, it WILL without a doubt help you take better pictures.  No Rebel has it.- Picture quality:  The T2i and the 60D are using the same sensor and Digic 4 processor so picture quality and noise are about the same, any differences are very minor so a wash here.- Movie mode:  The 60D is perhaps the best APS-C movie camera on the market, period.  It offers multiple frame rates and sizes and stereo audio control as well as an external stereo mic jack.  Comparable Nikons don't have this. Yes the new Nikons have auto focus while shooting movies but it does not work very well, is not reliable and fails to auto focus much of the time so I don't count it as a serious feature, it's no more than a feature bullet point, totally dismissible.  The 60D's articulating screen is also a huge plus for shooting movies.  If you care about movies the 60D may be the best APS-C camera out there right now.Another small but useful feature is a locking mode dial, if like me, you have ever accidentally changed modes while the camera was swinging at your hip you'll appreciate this feature. So if you look at this as the next step up from a Rebel the 60D starts to make a lot more sense.In short you get a bevy of upgrades and new features with the 60D over any of the Rebels for about $370.  Might some of these features be on the next Rebel?  Probably, but not all but you can get them now with the 60D.Compared to the higher end 7D there are some features missing such as the lens micro-adjustment which many photographers never user use, none the less it was on the 50D so this is a step back.  The 7D is capable of up to 8FPS due to its dual Digic 4s compared to 5.3 FPS for the 60D.  The 7D has a 100% view finder compared to the 60D's 96%. The Auto Focus system on the 7D is the newer 19 Point AF system which is superior to the 60D's older 9 Point.  The 7D also has a flash port which is important for some types of studio work, this was something that was on earlier XXDs but has now been removed.  The 7D also has a Magnesium alloy body so if you are very rough with your camera this might be a consideration although the 60D looks like it is pretty solid despite the gripes you read.  You also pay a heavy price in weight and cost with the 7D so if the 7D has more features then you need and you don't want to drive in nails with your camera the 60D may have everything you need and then some.It is not a slam on the 60D to say you need the 7D or that the T2i is good enough.  Canon is giving us a choice of features and functions at varying price points.  You get considerably more for you money with the 60D over the T2i but not as much with Pro oriented 7D.  One thing all three of these cameras have in common is excellent image quality, very good noise performance, and very good movie modes.Canon has finally placed the XXD series in a place where it is starting to make sense.  Whereas in the past the series was often up-staged by cheaper Rebels in features, like the 40D and 50D were.  The 60D is finally is starting to look like a natural progression in features, performance and price.  The Rebels are the entry level, the 60D the enthusiast camera and the 7D is the Pro or semi-pro camera.  We get to pick the camera that best suits our needs.  I think that's a good thing.The light weight is also a plus for some one that wants a light but strong body for field work or for dragging into the back country where weight counts. Strongly recommended for the photographer that has out grown a Rebel or wants a mid-level camera that can make large prints and shoot in low light.", "Date": "December 10, 2010"}, {"Title": "Not perfect, but a very good upgrade from T2i", "Author": "powerop", "ReviewID": "R17127W7M2IARO", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I'm pleased to say that the Canon 60D is a worthy investment for those upgrading from the Canon T2i. I had the great opportunity to own both cameras and see in-hand the differences between the two, and the differences are enough to warrant the extra hundred dollars, maybe more. First of all, I know that they share the same sensor and light metering so pretty much pictures under the same conditions turn out the same - high ISO noise control, color rendition, resolution. But take note that A LOT of how a picture turns out depends on the User and how they compose the shot, and thats where the 60D significantly differs...in handling and performance.The most glaring difference not easily seen in online reviews is the increase in viewfinder size. The brightness and larger size is like upgrading from a 21-inch lcd monitor to a 23-inch one. At first, I never knew or cared for this increase in spec, but seeing it first hand changed what I wanted in a camera. After all, you spend most of your time viewing through it and it definitely helps to see more of your shot before you take it. Next is the increase in build quality and hand grip size. Yes, its still not magnesium alloy but it feels much more sturdy than the T2i. Weight-wise the 60D is about one kit lens heavier (~200g) which does better balancing heavier lenses like the L series. That's what this camera promotes, a good upgradeable path to handle better lenses. The hand grip is much more filling in my hand. Despite the increase in weight, the ease of holding the camera and preventing strain actually depends more on how your hands hold in position. Another feature is the 9 cross-type AF sensors (T2i has only 1 in center) which allow better focusing in continuous shooting and low-light conditions. One example where I noticed the difference is indoor lighting. After taking random shots, the 60D just feels a little \"smarter\" on how it chooses the main focus points. Battery life is the next big difference for me. The 60D actually uses the same battery as the Canon 5D Mark II so you know its serious stuff. During one photo trip, one charge lasted over 1,000 photos with about 50% of them using liveview. The included battery charger is very fast too, and it has a retractable built-in prongs..none of that separate cord nonsense you get with the T2i charger. Take note that Maximal Power on Amazon has 3rd party batteries for cheap that works just like the original.Obviously there are blatant differences too. The swivel screen is great for self-portraits handheld in front of you because you can compose the picture instead of guessing the angle. My gf loves this feature the most for couple shots, and it makes us less relying on unsuspecting passerby's to take our photo. It does inspire creativity when using liveview to compose your shots as well since you dont have to strain your neck or pull a back muscle trying to bend down to take low-to-the-ground photos or over peoples gigantic heads. I haven't tried, but it turning the screen around would be useful for people doing self videos for youtube. The top lcd screen is also great for quick access for basic information, plus it saves battery life and it looks pro. You can basically use this top screen while having your main lcd screen inverted backwards for protection and compose your shots. The faster continuous burst rate of 5.3 vs 3.7 fps is noticeable, but the main difference is that the buffer size for the 60D is much bigger than the T2i to increase your chances of getting that perfect shot. Couple this with the better autofocus system and you can see what I mean about handling and performance. If you like to take shots of your kids running around in the house or fast dogs playing in the yard, then I would highly recommend the 60D over the T2i.Other difference in features that I haven't tried: horizontal virtual level, wireless flash control, and control over audio levels in movie mode.Dont get me wrong though, the T2i is a very good camera and probably more popular than the 60D. It has in its favor a lighter body, easier learning curve, and lower price. However, if you are just starting with DSLR's, I would highly recommend getting the T3i instead. Prices are almost the same as the T2i, and its more user friendly with the enhanced Auto mode. Plus it has the swivel screen!Everything is not mind-blowing with the 60D though. CONS include the same irritable custom white balance implementation and heavy orange-cast under tungsten lighting. The directional pad within the circular control wheel is almost flush and does not have distinct clicks to let you know if you sucessfully pressed it. Contrast liveview is still slow.Either way, all these cameras are great choices that will not let you down. This review includes my purchase with the 18-200mm lens. The lens is a little better than the 18-135mm version because it has a little more reach and magnification for close-up shots (.25x vs .21x) but comparing their prices I do not think its worth upgrading to the 18-200mm. Resolution, contrast, color and sharpness is about the same, but the 18-135mm is much cheaper and the difference between 135mm and 200mm is not significant.A handy tip if you want to take your camera to the next level is a hack called Magic Lantern orginally started as a videographer tool. It safely adds more features like trap focus, zebra control, plus much more. Please proceed at your own risk though. Hope this review helps!UPDATE 7.24.11 ********Came back from a trip from Niagara Falls, which also has fireworks every Friday. FYI, the 60D doesnt have more of the beginner, user-friendly mode scenes like fireworks apart from the basic portrait, night, landscape, sports, and flower mode. Another thought is that I wished the top lcd screen showed what PASM mode I'm in, as I often found myself struggling to see the setting of my mode dial in the dark. Granted, one can press the Info button to bring up the main screen, but then whats the purpose of the top lcd screen then?Despite its shortcomings, I am starting to really like this camera. The auto focus is fast and did fairly well in very dark conditions (without flash assist). Taking self-portraits (with the gf) using the swivel screen takes the guesswork out and was enjoyable, since the optional contrast-detect was much faster than phase-detect (plus it chooses the focus points for you). Let me tell you, being able to compose your shot for a self-portrait is great. Couple this with the 15-85mm lens (which I recommend) and you get great background coverage holding the camera in front of you. The camera body itself handled the humid, misty conditions of the majestic waterfalls no problem. And being able to adjust exposure on the fly with the rear wheel dial was convenient.On a side note, the camera strap itself comes custom made with \"Canon 60D\" in big bold, stitching. Hope this info helps some of you.UPDATE 8.3.11 ***********Bought the new 270EX II external flash to compliment the 60D. Its great! I previously owned the original 270ex (non-wireless version) so I knew its capabilities. Let me tell you, the new one really opens up a world of possibilities with the 60D since the 60D is capable of controlling groups of external flashes (or one in my case). When taking pictures, I was able to fire both my built-in flash and the 270EX II (off the camera) at the same time plus control the ratio of flash intensity between the two. I think flash photography is yet another upgrade path the 60D allows you to partake.I also just discovered that the 60D is the only Canon body in its class to allow interchangeable focus screens! I recommend the EF-D focus screen made for the 40D..it fits the 60D perfectly and helps compose your shots dramatically. Hope this helps.UPDATE 8.31.11 ***********AHHH!!! I just dropped my 60D and 15-85mm lens on the floor today. It fell from a countertop to hard-wood floor with a heart-stopping thud sound. My heart was palpitating too fast to remember which part of the camera hit first, but upon inspection I coulnd't see any damage. My lens had stabilization on and still works so maybe not the lens. I'm so glad the body and intricate internals withstood the fall. My bad 60D, forgive me baby?On another note, I got the EF-D focus screen easily installed and it works and fits perfectly. The laser-etched marks are thin and greatly help straighten your shots in the viewfinder. Too bad they're not exactly one thirds division. Remember to change focus screen setup in the custom menu.UPDATE 9.19.11 ***********Two words... Picture Styles. Learn it, love it, live it. I recently been playing with this feature, at the beginning just adjusting on-camera contrast, sharpness, etc., but now ventured into the more involved software customization of Picture Styles. Its great! First of all, Canon has on their website (if you google \"Canon Picture Styles\"), that you can download free Official Canon custom picture styles and port it into your 60D (which has 3 user-defined spots) using the EOS Utility software and usb cable. One Picture Style dubbed \"Autumn Hues\" optimizes color to enhance pictures of vibrant leaves of Fall, as an example. My recent idea was to desaturate all colors except Red hues, similar to Selective Color that Nikon and Pentax have, but only for one color (per picture style). Of course, you can customize to whatever style of picture you like and recomemend checking it out. Unfortunately, I have to say for a CON is that the software (Picture Style Editor) is not very user-friendly and somewhat technical. See my uploaded \"red rose\" picture for an example of a un-edited jpeg.UPDATE 10.2.11 ***********As a regular user, there's some more \"room for improvement\" or cons that I want to point out with the 60D. While it doesn't effect functionality, the 8-way controller pad on the back is starting to \"creak\" in certain conditions...just plain sounds cheap to me. In Creative Auto mode, while very useful for beginners, it doesn't save the settings when you change modes or turn off the camera...which is annoying to me since I like to use the Vivid setting on there (since its not found anywhere else on the camera). The mode dial, with its lock button, is okay to turn one-handed but I really wish they left it out. Never once have I accidently knock the mode dial out of position on my other DSLR's with mode dials. On the 60D, it only exacerbates the problem of turning the knob all the way around to get to the movie mode (if you are on the PASM modes) since the mode dial does not turn continuously in a 360 degree fashion (more like 320 degrees). Everything else handles like a dream for me..and its still my favorite DSLR.UPDATE 10.31.11************Trick or treat! Since my last update I got to know the 60D a little better and took it for a spin at a Halloween costume party over the weekend. It performed splendidly, almost second-nature in my hand. Here are some more pro/con observations:Trick: A bit irritated by the AWB performance in tungsten lighting. Even the tunsgten setting doesn't get it right. Kelvin adjustment might get it, but takes time doing guesswork and might as well go through the cumbsersome Custom white balance setting instead. Using flash helps. One can always post-process as well.Trick: AI focus and AI servo are weird to me. One mode doesn't show focus indicators and the other does. They do not wait until focus is achieved before capturing the shot during burst mode (at least to my knowledge). My Pentax system has focus-priority and speed-priority as an option.Trick: Video mode is great but has a serious moire problem with uniformly fine patterns (ie: the weave pattern of a gray mens suit).Treat: I can use the Custom User mode to save it as an \"Indoor\" setting for easy tungsten lighting balance. The 60D has 1 such setting on the Mode dial just beyond Bulb mode. It performs just like Program mode. In it, I can save fine-tune white balance adjustment and custom white balance settings independently from the other PASM modes.Treat: Holding down the AF-ON button instantly turns my USM lens into manual focus mode, not requiring a focus lock when I fullly press the shutter. This is different from using AF to focus then manually adjusting while holding half-press shutter. It also wakes up the metering system without having to press the shutter. You can also make it \"stop\" the metering system. The T3i does not have this button and is different from AE/FE * button.Treat: I love the way most of the buttons are on the right side of the camera, especially four buttons in particular: Menu, Info Q, and Set. Right now, I have this setup for quick access to everything during capture mode: Menu = straight into My custom functions, which includes external flash settings. Info = straight into Virtual Horizon level. Q = straight into on-screen settings, and finally Set = straight into WB balance menu.In all, the 60D was a treat to use that supresses my urge to upgrade to anything else because it simply does wonders once you learn it.

After looking at all the possibilities I narrowed it to five different choices: the Canon 5D MII, Canon 7d, Canon 60D, and Nikon D7000. The Canon 5D MII does have the full frame sensor which is very nice but personally this was more than I wanted to spend. I originally went with the T2i because it uses the same sensor as in the 7D and the 60D. It has great image and video quality for the price but the audio and tendency to overheat quicker than others caused me to return it. The inability to remove the auto gain control on this camera ruins it without buying a separate $300+ audio device. Even with the best mic on earth the AGC kills any chance of using the audio by filling it with hissing sounds. After returning the T2i I was debating between the 60D the 7D and the Nikon D7000.  The 7D is a better camera for shooting stills than either of the other two but has no advantage over the 60D in video.  Actually it has less features than the 60D does for video and it also has the dreaded AGC issue.  So I basically was deciding between the Nikon D7000 and the 60D. Nikon most certainly had the better build quality and it also handles higher ISO settings a bit better.  The new auto focus has like 3 million auto focus points all over the viewfinder which is very nice as well but Nikon once again falls short of Canon in the video department. The lack of a 60 fps option means that you will not be able to have decent smooth slow motion with the D7000.  It does have auto focus while shooting video but after trying this out myself it is basically useless.  You will spend more time and effort trying to get the auto focus to work right than just manually focusing yourself. Its manual sound control only has 3 settings of high medium and low unlike the 60D vast control over the audio. The articulating screen on the 60D really does help while trying to get odd angle shots and for shooting home movies. I do wish that Canon had kept the build quality that the 50D had with this model but it is still a solid camera loaded with tons of extras for the price. Hands down it is the best DSLR for video. The picture quality is also very nice.

It fits in my hand much better and the controls are easier to access.  When using my 50mm 1.4 the 60D focuses much more accurately than my T2i does.  I was having a lot of problem with the T2i front focusing, but the 60D has been spot on.  I am also very pleased with how it handles my indoor lighting.  Shots with my T2i usually turned out yellow when on auto-whitebalance, but the 60D seem to produce much better indoor color.  Another surprise was how quiet the shutter mechanism is.  It is much softer than the T2i which will be very nice with the wedding shoots I have coming up.  There are so many more advanced options in the menus than you get on a Rebel.

Last year, I purchased a Rebel T3i to use for both photography and video.  After doing some research, I decided that the T3i was probably the best value in DSLR video and I was (and still am) very happy with that camera.  However, the recent price drops on the 60D (due to the announcement of the 70D) inspired me to trade in my T3i and upgrade from the \"Rebel\" line of DSLRs.  I'm incredibly happy I did so and would whole-heartedly recommend the 60D to anyone serious about photography or DSLR video.It's important to remember that the 60D has the exact same cropped sensor as the T2i, T3i, T4i, and T5i Rebel cameras.  That means that the quality of photos and videos produced by the cameras will be virtually identical \u2013 and very good.  In the right hands, any one of those cameras can capture stunning photos and HD video.  The difference is largely in the quality and layout of the body, as well as the smarter, faster focusing system in the 60D.  The 60D feels great in the hands and \u2013 although it isn't advertised \u2013 there is apparently much better weather-sealing in the 60D than there is in the Rebels.  It has an articulating LCD screen, like the T3i (a real plus for video work), but it lacks the touch functionality of the T4i and T5i.Where the 60D really shines is in its manual controls.  Instead of having to hunt through menus or use combo-button presses, the 60D puts a ton of controls right at your fingertips.  The buttons are laid out in a fairly logical way and I became familiar with the workings of the camera pretty quickly.  The 60D is a camera that really wants to be used in \"manual\" mode.  If you're the kind of photographer that sticks mostly to automatic settings \u2013 which is fine! \u2013 this might not be the camera for you.I actually love having the digital readout on the top of the camera, which displays the aperture, shutter speed, ISO, and more.  Having that info on the top of the camera means that the rear LCD screen can remain off until you want to use the menus, check the electronic level (which is kind of rad), or review your pics.  This saves battery life (at least in photo mode) and is great for sunny conditions that make LCD screens tough to see.  Speaking of battery life, the 60D uses higher capacity batteries than the Rebel line.  They're a little heavier and a little pricier, but at nearly double the battery life, this is well worth it.I have a few nitpicks with the camera, although nothing very substantial.  It lacks some of the features, particularly for video, introduced into some of the more recent Rebels.  It doesn't have electronic video zoom (introduced in the T3i) and it can't autofocus during video recording (introduced in the T4i).  As I mentioned earlier, the LCD screen is touch-free.  Probably my biggest gripe is that it is weirdly inconvenient to switch the camera from photo-mode to video-mode.  Video mode is down at the very bottom of the mode dial, below all the \"creative\" modes (Sports!  Face!  Flower!) that I frankly wish weren't even there.  Going from \"M\" manual photo mode to video mode requires you to depress the dial lock and turn the thing almost completely around.  The T4i switches into video mode from the power switch, instead of the mode dial, which just makes so much more sense.  It's a tiny gripe, but a persistent one.  I also desperately wish that Canon would make a headphone jack standard issue on their video-equipped DSLRs for audio monitoring, but this is apparently wishful thinking.  There's one on the 5D Mark III, but right now that's five times the price of the 60D.Going from the T3i to the 60D has felt like switching from a consumer-grade camera to a professional one.  While I don't expect it to capture drastically better images, it has absolutely encouraged me to take ownership of the camera's manual controls and become a better, more knowledgeable photographer.  Now that the 60D's successor, the 70D, has been announced, I'm sure that many people are wondering if the 60D is still worth it.  The 70D will have an improved sensor (the first new Canon ASP-C sensor in years), and more video features, such as autofocus and digital zoom (still no headphone jack, though).  However, the 70D will also sell for around double what the 60D is currently selling for.  As far as I'm concerned, as a photographer and video user on a budget, that means that there has never been a better time to pick up a 60D.", "Date": "July 15, 2013"}, {"Title": "Fantastic Camera!!", "Author": "Jeff from NJ \"AUTOGRAPHHOUND1\"", "ReviewID": "RNW20QGRLFUCJ", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "First, I'm not a professional photographer. I bought the 60D because I was not happy with the quality of even the best point and shoots out there.  The 60D offered a smaller and more lightweight body than the 7D.  The 60D has a swivel screen which is fantastic when doing video. Trust me, it makes a huge difference.  I don't photograph sporting events, so 5.3fps instead of 8fps of the 7D was fine for me. I bought a Canon 24mm 2.8 prime lens to keep the overall size of the camera reasonable for my needs. I take family shots, and closer up images, so a zoom just wasn't necessary.  Image quality - Excellent!  A prior reviewer said it takes the same images as the 7D, which is an extremely well reviewed and quality camera. So you get this camera for $300 or more less, the same exact image quiality, and more bells and whistles.  Autofocus is very fast. Like night and day compared to any point and shoot.  I like the dial lock as I was always moving the wheels on any point and shoots I've owned.  No autofocus in video mode, which is a true negative. I hope they upgrade that in a future body.  That said, you can manual focus during video which is silent and more accurate.  Lots of talk about this being plastic vs. metal. Don't pay any attention to it. This thing feels great. Nice and solid. Plastics today can be made even stronger than metal, so the whole plastic vs. metal thing should not even enter your mind, not for a second.  You get a camera that weighs less!!  Try hanging a 4 pound piece of steel around your neck for 8 hours and see how fun it is. Lighter and smaller is exactly what people are looking for.  All in all, this camera rocks.

However, I have played with my friend's 40Ds, 50D's, 7D's, 5D's and 5dMkII's a lot. My style is a photo journalistic style, where I follow people and take candid pictures or posed pictures. I take pictures of children and at times, just still subjects like food products or decorations. I have previously taken a lot of photos from my old Canon S400 and SD800IS point and shoot cameras. My XSi was and still is a wonderful camera. I still find myself bringing the XSi for trips, so I don't have to worry too much about the body. I've probably taken at least 20,000 pictures on it already. I have done some event photography as well for friends or friends of friends.I was hesitant to purchase the 60D because of all the flak and hate people were throwing at it. Some of the complaints I heard were:(-) A Polycarbonate aluminum chassis - a downgrade from the Magnesium alloy(-) 5.3 fps - decreased from 6.3fps(-) lack of lens microadjustment - only the 50D had this in the xxD line as I recall.(-) SD cards - used to use CF cards(-) Bad product direction seen in the xxD line - Seems like they are going to dumb it down for noobs.I'll try to address these separately, but won't go really deep in them.Polycarbonate Aluminum ChassisThe change back to a \"Plastic\" casing has quickly gotten the label of being cheap, less-durable and unprofessional. Cheap, it does seem cheaper, I will agree with that. Metal is more expensive. Less-durable? I don't know about this. Plastics nowadays are so strong that could withstand a good fall on the floor, water damage and maybe even some fire. [...] In my hand, the 60D feels very comfortable. It has weight and heft to not make it feel like a smaller cheaper camera. The feel is important here, because this is what you are feeling when you grip your hand to shoot photos. I think the 60D is almost at the borderline of being just large enough to fit fully and comfortably in one hand, meaning, don't be smaller than the 60D in the future or else it might as well be a Rebel. As for being unprofessional. This is the one that I find that ego and pride get in the way of logic makes it irrational. No one in their right mind is going to say you are unprofessional just because it isn't build like a tank. How often are you going to drop your camera? I bet less than you drop you phone by a long shot. The only impact I get from my camera is knocking into walls or tables. It doesn't do a thing. Thus, watch the video on durability on the plastics even on the Rebel series that I have already put a link to in this paragraph.5.3fps - Slower than 6.3This one is the case of losing something that has been in the xxD line for 2 generations. The 40D had 6.5fps, the 50D had 6.3fps. Now the 60D is only 5.3fps. I see how people are disgruntled here. Losing that extra frame sucks. I won't argue that maybe that extra frame could have been the right frame. In some way, this is an argument of numbers. Mind you, if a photographer wanted to do some highspeed photography like sports, they probably wouldn't have looked at the xxD line of products anyway. The would have looked at the xD (1Ds or 7Ds). Oh, also, did you notice that the 5Dmkii only has 3.9 fps? That is a professional Full Frame camera. Do people complain? yes they do. Should you worry about it? I don't think so. Some people (not all people) just like to see higher fps numbers, but almost never use it. And when they do use it, it isn't going to be the life saver they may think it is. I had shot with my 3.5 fps with the XSi and that was very good already. I is about photography technique, not the numbers and capabilities of the camera. So is it a huge loss of 1fps? Not a huge loss. I agree that is sucks and is a downside, but it is not a deal breaker at all.Lack of lens microadjustmentLike the previous 5.3fps argument. This one is more of a case of been given something and then taken away right away. Only the 50D had this function. The 40D didn't have the Lens microadjustment. Once again, it would be nice to have when you need it for sure. But once again, is it necessary to take good shots? No it isn't. People can still take wonderful shots with the 30D or 40D and they didn't have this functionality. When it is needed though, it is super helpful to adjust the lens for the body. Most of the time, you won't have to worry about this. If you really really need it done, get the lens calibrated, hopefully that helps.SD cards coming from CF cards for xxD lineSome will like and some will hate. Personally, I like this approach for Canon. SD cards, are smaller, cheaper but not as fast. But what I love about having SD cards is that i don't have to carry an extra card reader to transfer to my laptop. All new laptops have SD card slots, so I never have to worry about forgetting a card reader. The SD card in the xxD line also helps reduce a small amount of bulk on the side of the camera. Sure the writing speeds aren't as good, but the future is looking great for SD cards and SDXC. If I had to choose to care SD cards or CF cards around on a trip or event, SD cards. I can just keep them in my pocket and never have to worry about the pins inside the camera from becoming bent.Bad product direction for the xxD lineThis is where a lot of other arguments get merged into. Because the xxD is now in between the xxxD and xD line (Rebel and 7D line of products), it has to be able to make itself distinct enough to be deemed a separate line of family. It has to take the some of the good features from both lines and bring them together and also add new things to it to make it useful. Is the xxD line going in the wrong direction? I don't know actually, this is the first time the xxD line has been quite different from the previous generation, aka the 50D. What many don't realize is that the 60D has gained some really good characteristics from the 7D, namely the wireless flash control. Thank goodness for this. But at the same time, lost the PC sync. Hmm, maybe Canon has something else planned for the future of this wireless flash control that would make the PC sync obsolete in the future? We don't know. Many people attribute the 18MP sensor to the T2i. But please remind yourself that the 18MP sensor came from the 7D. So instead of \"losing\" to the T2i. The xxD line has gained from the 7D line. Same goes with the 63-zone metering system, it is more gained from the 7D and then into the 60D. Video capability from the 7D, which is also shared by the T2i. Horizontal Electronic Level, this is useful for tripod shots or even some hand held. But I see the value for the tripod just as a final check.The increase of the Auto modes is kind of stupid. I know why Canon might have put it in, but it would have been way better to just remove it altogether. Video mode should have been put on the creative auto portion of the mode dial with M, Av and Tv. It really is a pain to move there. Speaking of mode dial, this is one that many people are very split on. I really like it. When I was using the XSi, I was consistently changing the mode without realizing until I after I had taken the shot. And the mode dial wasn't even hanging out on the side of the camera. So the locking mechanism for the mode dial is something I like in the 60D and new to the xxD line.I don't blame people for being very demanding and have high expectations of cameras from Canon, but one should be reasonable. It would be very unlikely that the 60D would gain a ton of features from the 7D. If it did, the 7D would instead be the one that could not be distinct. I believe that if the 7D came out, then the 60D then the T2i, the complaints would be different. I could even foresee people complain if the order of release was T2i, 60D and 7D, with the same features set. I can see how people would argue differently and maybe have praised the 60D. To me, the 60D is just an evolution of the product line and not a revolution like the 40D was to the 30D. Does it make it a bad product? Not at all. It takes marginally better pictures than the 50D and is at least at par with the 7D and T2i. Oh one more thing I really like in this new product line. They use the same LP-E6 batteries as 7D and 5Dmkii. YAY!!! I can share batteries with my friends. This is great because more commonality between these lines is not a burden, but a great plus.D7000 vs 60D battle (not a war) is like a battle of pride with no substance.Another BIG BIG argument in the world of DSLRs now is the whole D7000 vs 60D argument. Many people love this argument because it is time for Nikon fans (not going to say they are fanboys, because I know there are some Canon fanboys too) to really blow their horns and tout superiority by numbers. Once again, I'll repeat, superiority by numbers. Why do mention this? It is because people allow numbers, specs and math to determine why they like a camera or system. Some people will argue that because the D7000 is a better specced camera, therefore, by transitivity, the D7000 will take better pictures by a long shot. What do the results show? Marginally better, is the probably the common thing noticed if anything is ever noticed between the photos. The D7000 has everything the 60D doesn't have and improves on it is another one I have heard several times that have caused Canon users to think, \"Oh Nikon has a wonderful D7000, I think it is time to jump boat\". I won't prevent them from doing so. But this argument is similar to that of girlfriends almost. Oh, that girlfriend has better \"specs\" that my current one, I think I will just dump this \"system\" and go to the Nikon. The word I would use to describe this is \"Brand\" insecurity. It isn't wrong to change systems. But the reasoning behind it needs to be thought over. I am afraid that some people are just insecure about their purchase that they need to be able to walk around town, events or show others to match the level of pride they have.Back to this D7000 and 60D battle. Who is going to win? I actually wouldn't look it in that way. I would say, the D7000 and the 60D are both wonderful systems and both have proven to take wonderful pictures, hold up to weather effects, is durable (mind you, D7000 has magnesium alloy, but it isn't the entire body, only partial, its marketing getting to your head.), great ergonomics, has video capability, etc. There isn't a battle at all actually. It is just a bunch nerd battles like D&D; with their character sheets. My camera has more strength and dexterity while the Canon has more charisma and constitution. See how irrelevant this argument and so called battle is? It is down to numbers and pride. The seaweed is always greener, in somebody else's lake.Oh. Let's also put it this way. As I had mentioned about the order of being released. If the order of release was like 7D, 60D and T2i for the Nikon camp, the story and arguments would be just like canon's. D400, then D7000 and lastly D5000. People would have said, why doesn't the D7000 act more like the D400. That is my point.The actual review of the 60D without trying to compare too much.I have had the 60D for 2.5 weeks and have taken some videos and pictures with it at some events and some portraits. Some at low ISO and some at high ISO (3200 and 6400). Compared to the XSi, the pictures were better, but not immensely better. What was more important was the technique in taking the photo that made more of a difference. The 60D, with its better size and ergonomics (compared to Rebel series) really helped me to keep my hands steady and to choose the properly settings to get the pictures looking really nice without any post processing. I have used the remote flash trigger with great results and I really really like the camera. The price point now is just amazing for the 60D. And when the camera is put with the 24-70mm f2.8 and 50mm f1.4, the images are loved by all who I take a photo for. Is it because the camera that made the huge difference? No. But it did help me as a photographer to take better pictures.The better photos at high ISO is attributed to Canon's research in sensors that they have put into the 7D. The images continue to look great even at high ISO. The articulated screen helps me take ninja candid shots without people noticing and that is something I wouldn't be able to get in T2i or the 7D. Some clients love this type of photography even though they don't like to be taken pictures of. I don't have to worry too much about the high ISO when taking these shots now as I can trust the 60D to resolve good photos in the end as long as I did my part as a photographer to keep the camera steady.The price point of the camera with such good features is actually great. At $999 at the time of posting, is the even cheaper than the 50D when it came out. So if you are in the area and are looking to get th 60D, buy it, because you won't be disappointed as long as you don't feel insecure. The camera takes absolutely wonderful pictures indoor and outdoor. Videos are good and the same as the 7D and T2i. It is rugged, as mentioned by digital rev. I can't say much more to praise the camera. Buy it, don't look back and take photos. You by a camera to shoot photos, not so you can bring it to a party and compare specs and see who is better?

I only shoot as a hobby so my review will be from a hobby standpoint.  To give a little background to know where my review comes from, I took photojournalism in high school, but did not really shoot regularly until 15 years later when I bought this camera. I really felt the entry level models would be too basic, and a pro level too far above my head.  When buying I considered both nikon and canon, and after settling on canon was looking at the t2i, 60d, and 7d.  I mainly shoot nature or my friends at events. As I like to shoot nature, I wanted a camera I felt would hold up to being taken out on a four wheeler ride up in the mountains, or to keep with me when out camping.The main thing that made me select this camera over the t2i or the 7D was the articulating screen.  As stated above I do ride four wheelers occasionally and felt the abilty to close the screen would prevent scratches and dust particles rubbing on the screen due to the vibrations on the four wheeler.  (ive scratched my cell phone screen up, so I figure this screen would be just as easily scratched) So if you plan on putting your DSLR into a bag/backpack and going outdoors where it could be dusty, Id recommend a camera with an articulating screen.  On my particular camera I turned off the review photo feature and mostly keep the screen closed, and only open when I want to review a specific photo.Ive read alot of other reviews and there seem to be lots of complaints about the \"plastic\" body.  The camera is solid I have no problems putting this camera in my backpack and taking it hiking or putting it on the four wheeler.  The body has heft to it, it's not a cheap hollow plastic body.  I feel confident the camera would stand up to being dropped from a normal height and still shoot.  I find the ligher (but sufficiently strong) body better suited for my needs when I want to take it on a hike in a backpack and weight is important.Most reviews ive read talk about how the camera feels in hand.  I too agree this camera feels good in the hand.  The grip is sufficient to let me feel like I have a solid grip on the camera when im just walking around. I took my 60D with a Sigma 70-200 f2.8 attached on a mile and a half hike and pretty much carried the camera by the grip and it was comfortable.  Also, I like that the buttons and controls are pretty much all accessible with the right hand.  Once you learn your way around, you can make changes with your right hand while still holding the camera to your eye with the left.Also, ive read reviews which complain about having to push down in the center of the mode dial in order to turn it.  To me this is nonsense.  Its easy and comes very natural.  Ive also read complaints thats the video mode is all the way at the end of the mode dial.  I have yet to find this to be a problem.  In all fairness I rarely shoot video with my camera. In my opinion, when im thinking of shooting video im out with that purpose so it will stay in that mode.  If im out to shoot photos it will generally stay in that mode. For the 5% of the time I decide to shoot both, ive had no issues getting from one mode to the other.After a year of using this camera I started looking at cameras again to see what is out there and if I would change my mind and now go for the 7D or T3i.  I've looked at the others in the store and wouldnt go down to a t3i from a 60d.  I do think the plastic body of the t3i is of lesser quality plus I dont like not having a wheel selector on the back, and find myself using the top LCD panel quite often.  I would like faster frames per second of the 7D but thats really the only thing more I would really like. For my uses, the ligher 60d with the ability close the screen for added protection make me feel more confident with the camera outdoors.  I realize the 7D is better weather sealed, however unless you have weather sealed lenses and plan on shooting in torrential downpours this doesnt realistically benefit me.  That said if I was buying again id likely go with the 60d again, but put an articulating screen on the 7D and it would be a difficult decision.", "Date": "November 8, 2011"}, {"Title": "Great Deal for a Canon", "Author": "J V V \"Road-Guy\"", "ReviewID": "RR62H7IZ00O8W", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Bought this as a second body back-up and now use it more than my primary. If you don't need all of the bells and whistles, weather proofing, this is the perfect camera. In the Canon lineup it lives between the pro equipment and the enthusiast stuff, so for just a great carry camera and all around fun rig, it's terrific. The flip-out screen sold me on this and now that I have it, everything else seems primitive. The one thing I didn't expect to utilize as much as I now do is the built in level in the viewfinder and for low light shooting, it's a must-have. The one big drawback to this camera is the focus on live-view is slow and clumsy, but for what I do (timelapse and night photography), it's rarely an issue. I'd buy this again in a heartbeat.", "Date": "December 13, 2010"}, {"Title": "Body only or kit?", "Author": "Acontius \"Acontius\"", "ReviewID": "R8Z73ZDLIH4KT", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I go along with all the praise on this and will just mention a few points.First, I went back and forth:  Body only or kit?  I'm glad I went with just the body, because I spent a little more and also bought the Canon EF 50mm 1.4 lens.  What a fantastic combination!  Startlingly clear shots, richness of depth and color, and very, very lightweight combined with the 60D.  The resolution is so sharp that you can crop your image quite small to get a good zoom effect and still have great prints.Another point to consider about the kit lens is the AF.  Using a lens that has a minimum aperture smaller than 2.8 dumbs down the center AF point on the 60D, as clearly stated in the manual.  I want to get the most out of my AF.  Plus, those several extra fractions of stops below 2.8 come in very handy and allow for low light shots without the need for a flash or cranking the ISO too high.I was disappointed that Micro-Focus Adjust was not one of the features built-in; however, before buying the 60D, I did test my three old lenses and found them to be focusing accurately.  I hope they stay this way!  As said, I bought the 50mm 1.4 with this and, fortunately, it focuses precisely.The flip screen is handy for still shots in live view if your subjects are staying still and you have time to let the contrast AF find its target.  To get the most out of a DSLR that has amazing video quality, I couldn't imagine going without a screen that can tilt like this.EDIT:  You can also use \"AF Quick Mode\" in Live View, but it takes two distinct presses of the shutter button--one to focus, the next, all the way down, to take the shot.  It seems a little awkward, but it is the way to use the camera's AF points while in Live View.One other feature I like about Live View:  I can disable it.  I have been accidentally engaging it while handling the camera.  Believe me, it is easy to turn it on by mistake and drain the battery.  Since I'm rarely going to need Live View spontaneously to grab a quick shot, I just leave it disabled.  If I need to put the camera over my head or on the ground in and awkward position, making the Live View button active again is pretty quick.  And, BTW, disabling the Live View button does not affect movie mode at all that I can see.The LCD display itself is wonderful for quick, accurate feedback and for reading the menus.  The Quick Menu's large font on such a sharp screen makes life very easy for those of us who don't want to be slipping on reading glasses all the time.Before using the camera even once, I trimmed down an iPod screen protector to fit on the 60D's LCD.  For sure your nose is going to leave big greasy prints on the screen when you are using the viewfinder!  I like being able to flip the screen inward for safety when stowing the 60D, but otherwise I just leave it screen-side out (with the protector on) so I'm not constantly putting wear on the hinge.That hinge, by the way, is smooth and seems durable, but I'll still be very easy on it.Coming from a 20D, this is a massive, wonderful upgrade.  I thought a bit about getting a FF sensor, but the clarity and the size of the RAW images make me happy I saved the money by going with the cropped sensor.  Plus the 60D's features are so rich, so up-to-date.  Compared to the 20D, the AF is faster and more accurate.  Ergonomically, this fits my hand better.  The right-side grip area feels a little deeper than the 20D's, making this easier to carry securely in one hand when you get tired of carrying it on your neck.My other choice was the 7D, but I felt like the savings could go towards the better lens and Photoshop.  Yes, the 7D has some stronger specs in a few areas, such as faster rapid-fire and more sophisticated AF, but the features of the 60D, and the same sensor as the 7D, made me feel this was the better value.  And I already mentioned the flip screen being so important for easy video use.By the way, I'm using a Transcend 16GB Class 10.

I shot 20,000+ shots with that camera, but recently became annoyed at how much noise there was at ISO settings as low as 400.A few months ago, I was poking around Amazon, and noticed that Canon had come out with the 60D. I had been thinking about a new camera, unwilling to spend the $$ for the 7D, and not feeling like there was enough of an upgrade for the T2i. When I saw the specs of the 60D, I thought \"That's my next camera.\" Within a week of finding it on Amazon, a friend of mine got a 60D. I played with it for an hour or two, and then I went home and bought one for myself. I'm glad I did.Pros: (in no particular order)* Great image quality.* Shoots HD video* Does a good job with the metering of pictures. (My XT had a tendency to under-expose shots)* Fairly simple to re-learn from the XT. Buttons are in different places, but all of the functions are the same...* Battery lasts a LONG time. I've shot over 1400 shots on a single battery charge. (Although, ~500 of them were for a time-lapse video, so I wasn't using the screen...)* Fits my large hands much better than my XT.* Very little shutter lag. It feels like it has less than my old XT.* Can shoot large RAW files and smaller jpg at the same time and vice versa.* Articulating screen is very nice. I have a Lowepro Slingshot 200 All Weather Backpack (Black) and have tucked away the screen protector cloth since my screen is folded into my camera when not in use.* 5.3 fps. Although some complain about the downgrade from the 50D, I never had the 50D -- so it doesn't matter to me. It's a lot nicer than what my XT had...* The built-in mic doesn't sound too bad considering that it's a built in mic. It sounds a whole lot nicer than any video camera I've ever used...Cons:* Slow to auto focus in video/live view mode. I've taken to manually focusing while shooting any action video, I just need a small enough aperture to allow for a margin of error.* Canon's switch from CF to SD. I had 12+ gb of CF cards which I've had to replace. Fortunately, Class 10 SDHC cards are getting pretty cheap these days...* The battery grip is quite expensive... I had the grip for my XT, but haven't bought one for my 60D yet. I am considering not getting one at all, since the 60D fits my hands well enough as it is.Overall:Very nice camera! Definitely worth the upgrade from my XT.*Update 5/23/11*Over the past 5 days, I've taken over 3000 pictures on a single battery charge. (And I've still got at least 25% battery life left!) This camera continues to impress me, and I'm still amazed at some of the pictures I take with it.

Vaccari", "ReviewID": "R38YRD3C5EMTVH", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I have learned photography for several years shooting film on Contax cameras, which have wonderful ergonomics and excellent lenses. However, the time delay and inconvenience of developing film (especially for a busy student like myself) meant that I was shooting less and less as time went on.However, I realized that if I bought a Canon DSLR, I would be able to adapt my manual-focus Zeiss lenses to it for great image quality and a low price. However, I had several criteria: I wanted a decent viewfinder (bright and large), I wanted a larger grip than a Rebel provides, and I was on a budget. The 40D and 50D passed me by, because whenever I held one, I simply didn't like the ergonomics: the top LCD was cluttered, I disliked the 8-way controller, and CF cards were a pain.I would be able to overcome those issues if I were up to purchasing a 5D mark II, but that was considerably out of my budget.The 7D looked promising too, but there were several critical flaws: It has a non-interchangeable focusing screen, and it cost a bit too much for my liking.However, when the 60D came out, I knew I had to have one for several reasons:It has a pentaprism finder of decent size.It has a swivel screen (My point-and-shoot has one and it's indispensable!).The camera took SD cards, which my laptops can read without a USB card reader.The body is lighter than any of the xxD or xD cameras that preceded it.So, I tried one in a store, and it fit my hand so perfectly that I decided to buy it as soon as the price dropped. So, a month later, the price dropped a hundred dollars and I bought it, and I could not be happier.The 18-135 lens, which isn't really the sharpest lens in the Canon stable, is an ergonomic gem. The zooming on this lens is so smooth and even, and the feel of the zoom grip is just outstanding: not tacky or liable to peel, but not slippery either. Focusing was fast enough for me.The camera itself can take pictures at ridiculously low light conditions: I mounted my Contax 50/1.4 lens on the 60D (with an adapter) and took a photo of a deer, without flash, AT MIDNIGHT. I could never even dream of doing that with a film camera.The grip is incredibly comfortable that I can hold the camera for hours without fatigue.IQ is extremely good, in both photos and video (720p video does have aliasing, though).The battery lasts essentially forever unless you do live-view shooting.The camera hardly slows down its picture-taking.The button arrangement is excellent for one-handed use: I could never get used to the left-handed buttons on the 7D and 5Dii when I tried them. Plus, the top plate buttons are single-function, and the new 8-way controller is outstanding for navigating menus.I use the Ef-S focusing screen in it for manual focusing my fast Contax primes, but the finder is still a bit unsharp. That's my main problem with the camera, but I'm planning on remedying that with a viewfinder magnifier: I hope it works well and doesn't obstruct the swivel screen.Overall, if you want the best compromise of image quality, camera ergonomics, performance, and price in the entire Canon lineup, this is it.", "Date": "February 12, 2011"}, {"Title": "great camera, ok lens", "Author": "brewstah", "ReviewID": "R3UF57UFCOZ00B", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "if you don't need the 8 frame per second of the 7d, but still want the image quality this is the right camera. the controls are a significant improvement over the rebels, without the completely new functions found in the 7,5 and 1d models. the build quality is quite solid, and dont listen to those who complain about not having magnesium alloy as this plastic is tough enough. i tested this model against the t2i and 7d and i found that the overall image quality is the same as the 7d and significantly sharper (and lower noise) than the t2i, the 5 frames per second wont last long without a good card, though it is faster in raw than jpeg, the lock on the dial is great as i always store my camera in aperture priority mode, so if i need to quickly grab my camera i know exactly what mode i'm in.Pros: great image quality and great color, advanced features that you will actually use, wireless flash control, comfortable size and weight, the swivel screen opens up new ways to compose like at concerts, not that bad at getting the action as 5 frames per second is still pretty quick.Cons: outside of full manual mode you might get slight overexposed pictures when using the built in flash indoors, the pre programed modes seem to want to use the built in flash in some situations where it is not necessary (though if you are buying this camera you should be at least moving away from those settings)ok now onto the lens, i got this camera with the lens as i needed a backup, i normally use a sigma 10-20mm and the canon 24-105L to cover my wide to short telephoto needs. it is a good lens overall with better optical quality and lower chromatic aberration than the 17-85mm usm lens. though the motor has been silenced a bit it is not the quietest lens on the market.Pros: good optical quality, a more solid build quality than rebel kit lenses, really nice range for a basic carry around lens. the front of the lens does not rotate which helps with circular polarizing filters.Cons:much slower focusing than a hypersonic motor, unable to see the focal length, loud when focusing (not as bad as most non hsm lenses) NO LENS HOOD, not giving a lens hood is just canon being cheap (they do not include lens hoods with non L series lenses)overall this is a great camera, i'm a semi pro fine art photographer and i love the way this camera shoots. as i said before if you don't need 8 frames per second and are looking for a camera that is a step up from the rebel series this is the right camera for you. though i am also a big believer that the camera is only as good as the lens, as far as kit lenses this one is great, though if you are on the fence about what lens to get i would recommend spending the extra money on a L series lens kit, or for those who want aps-c focal leinghts the sigma 17-70 is hsm or the sigma 18-50 is hsm if you are into portrait photography.", "Date": "December 24, 2010"}, {"Title": "Second time's a charm", "Author": "N. Hoang \"Potstickr\"", "ReviewID": "R17O45CF8NUF6L", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "After seeing me drool over an SLR, my Wife gave me a 60D for my birthday =DWe really wanted to order from Amazon, but Newegg had a better deal at the time for the kit, so we went with them.  Bad news is the first one arrived defective.  The card slot kept sticking and would not release my memory card.  The real defect was the charger that flat out wouldn't work.Before returning for a replacement unit, I tried Canon customer support in hopes of a speedier resolution since our Anniversary was only 2 days away and we wanted to capture the celebration in SLR style.  Jeff from Canon Support could not have been more understanding, he quickly arranged to have a new battery overnighted to us (suspecting it was a battery problem at first).  We received the battery the next morning only to realize the charger was the culprit.  We didn't get to use the 60D on our Anniversary, but we greatly appreciate the care we received from Canon Support and don't regret the purchase.When we finally received the 60D replacement, everything was wonderful.  The memory card slot didn't stick like the first model and the charger worked as expected, but now we had an extra backup batter--complements of Canon Support.  This was our first SLR and we were looking for something that could handle low-light and take better action shots than our Canon SD870is point-and-shoot.  The 60D simply delivers!...as it should, considering the price.  The autofocus system is very quick and pictures have much better color accuracy...objects simply POP with detail and contrast!  I love the continuous burst mode, inspiring confidence that you won't miss the action.  Especially useful is the ease of adjusting shutter speed and ISO settings to compensate for dim environments.  I found the controls very intuitive.Although it's often stated that kit lenses aren't very good, I really like the 18-135mm included lens.  To me, it provides superb clarity and detail.  I'm really glad it has image stabilization to smooth out shakes and the zoom range is great enough to cover the majority of shooting we'll do.Haven't really had a chance to test out the movie mode, but it definitely was a feature that swayed me towards the 60D over the Nikon D7000.  Because I do plan to use this camera for video 1/3 of the time, I really enjoy having the articulating screen.  It's been useful with just still photos.  I do believe the D7000 is flat out a better camera and I like its more sophisticated autofocus system, dual memory cards, movie mode auto focus, higher ISO range, and 100% viewfinder but the kit was more than what we wanted to spend.  On top of that, I really don't know if I would be able to tell that great of a difference in image quality between the two, DxOmark scores be damned.With it's 5.3 fps burst mode, great low light performance, quick autofocus, myriad video framerates, and articulating screen, the Canon 60D easily exceeds our needs and motivates me to take more pictures and improve my photography technique(s).  We received incredible support from Canon after purchase and easily recommend the EOS 60D!There are 2 things I would change about the camera, though.  I wish the viewfinder was 100%, as it's a little annoying finding extra objects in the picture afterwards.  As much as I do love the 60D, I also really really wish it didn't have the mode dial lock.  Having to depress a button at the center of the dial before you can turn the mode dial is very cumbersome and irritating.  I fear I'll break the mode dial someday simply because I forgot to hold down the unlock button.", "Date": "November 17, 2010"}, {"Title": "Great for the amateur videographer", "Author": "Matt", "ReviewID": "R3PC1F9CZKADA1", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Just to preface, this review is really more aimed at those that are considering this camera for its video capabilities.I would argue that this is the BEST choice out there compared to other mid-range DSLRs.

G. CHARLOT", "ReviewID": "R3TK211OY5EOP8", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "DPReview.com and TheDigitalPicture.Com both have extensive, in-depth reviews of the 60D, so I won't re-hash technical details here that the experts have already covered better than I could.  My review will just be a list of likes/dislikes and commentsWhat I like about the 60D:1. Fits and feels really nice in my hand, especially compared to Canon's Rebel line of DSLR's, which are smaller and feel too cramped to me.2. User can control just about every exposure parameter imaginable.  This camera will allow you to express your creativity in ways that you won't outgrow quickly.3. With \"L\" series lenses, the CMOS sensor in the 60D takes outstanding photographs. I suppose the 5D and 1D out-perform the 60D in several functional areas (besides their obvious megapixel advantages) but I doubt that I could shoot photos that were significantly better with a 5D.4. The flip-out LCD is a must-have for anyone who wants to shoot video. Also makes it much easier to shoot landscape photos with the camera right down on the ground (very dramatic landscapes can be shot this way).5. Very fast and responsive, certainly fast enough for landscape and general purpose photography. NOTE: The experts are generally of the opinion that the 60D's buffering and writing speed is \"marginal\" for sports photography.Dislikes:Only one so far: the video format of this camera is QuickTime MOV. I discovered a long time ago that QuickTime is one of the LEAST widely supported, and most difficult to edit, video standards. Most open-source editors like VirtualDub have no built-in support for it, requiring tedious and time-consuming conversion of the MOV file to AVI or MPEG before actual editing can even begin.  Also, the MOV files from the 60D seem to be awfully large, about 360 megabytes per minute for full-HD size, 30 fps.  After converting to AVI and re-encoding with XVid (at 5000 kbps), my finished videos are 1/3 to 1/2 the size of the original MOV with no visible loss of image quality. Setting XVid to 3000 kbps yields an AVI that is 1/4 the size of the original with only a slight image quality loss that most people would probably not even be aware of.  I assume that Canon chose this minimal level of compression deliberately, sacrificing file size economy for reduced in-camera processing and power consumption requirements.Just keep in mind that a 3 minute video clip from this camera is a full gigabyte, so if you shoot a lot of video, you will quickly use up even a large hard drive unless you re-process those MOV's to some other, more size-economical format.Who should buy a 60D:1. If you already have a kit of EF or EF-S lenses, and are looking to replace an older Canon DSLR that is 8 megapixels or less.2. If you don't need the specific benefits (like very shallow depth of field) that a \"full-frame\" sensor camera like the 5D or 1D can provide.3. If you want a back-up camera to a 5D or 1D that can be taken to places or into environments where you might not want to risk your more expensive full-frame camera. The 60D is priced only slightly higher than the T3i and feels much nicer in the hand. A professional used to a 5D or 1D would probably get along better with a 60D as a backup than with a T2i or T3i Rebel.4. As a first DSLR for someone upgrading from a point-and-shoot or film camera. I would skip over the Rebel line and go right for a 60D. You won't outgrow this camera for quite a while, and it's far more affordable than a 5D.NOTE: If you can squeeze enough cash out of your budget to buy \"L\" series lenses, DO IT!!! You will not be dissapointed. Canon's \"L\" series lenses are so much better than the basic consumer lenses in both image and build quality that they will last you a lifetime and you will never outgrow them.UPDATE JUNE 2012:I took the 60D to Death Valley National Park last winter and the camera performed flawlessly. It's versatility, in terms of focus and exposure settings, is incredible. Until Canon comes out with a 36 megapixel version of the 5D, (to compete with the Nikon D800), I don't see myself outgrowing the 60D.I still have not become totally proficient with the 60D as a video camera. Here's the problem: compared to most camcorders, the 60D has far less automation. For example, my Canon HV-20 camcorder, even in it's most basic configuration, reliably and _quickly_ sets and adjusts focus and exposure, so I rarely get a bad shot, even when hand-holding it: just aim and pan, and let the camera worry about everything else. The 60D can only auto-focus when you manually press the focus button, which places a noticeable discontinuity in the video. And of course it's not \"continuous\" auto-focus.  Exposure control is also tricky. To get automatic exposure, I think you have to set auto-ISO speed, otherwise you have to manually adjust f-stop and shutter, and the camera's mic clearly records the \"CLICK\" every time you turn either of the control dials. The 60D's video output is beautiful - if the settings are proper, and the lighting is adequate - especially with \"L\" series lenses. But, the learning curve to get those beautiful videos is MUCH steeper than with a purpose-built video camcorder.I have some more info on the 60D's video output. At maximum quality, which is 1920x1280, 30 fps, the camera's default average output bit rate is 45,000 kbps.  This bitrate produces huge files: a 500 gig laptop hard drive holds only 3.7 hours of HD video at the 60D's bitrate, which could be a problem for someone on a two week photo trip with only a laptop on which to store camera output. If you shoot a lot of video on your vacations, I recommend you bring an external hard drive of at least 2 terabytes to supplement whatever hard drive your laptop has. I also have difficulty playing these big files: Windows Media Player and VLC both drop frames and frequently skip, and this on a desktop computer running XP-64 with a 2.7 ghz dual-core CPU and 8 gigs of RAM.There is an alternative if you need to conserve disk space: reprocess the 60D's video to MPEG-4 AVI at a lower bitrate. After re-encoding with XVID (2-pass) at 10,000 kbps, my 60D's video still looks very good; edges and fine details are still sharp. Large areas of uniform color, like the sky, show barely perceptible compression artifacts (color banding), but I was looking for this problem - a casual viewer of the video would almost certainly not notice it.  The final file size was 24% of the original MOV file, and the file played much more smoothly in both VLC and Windows Media Player.Even at 4,000 kbps, the video is still pretty good, except that large areas of uniform color, like the sky, show strong compression artifacts (color banding), and sharp edges become slightly fuzzy. You might reduce the bitrate this low (and re-size to a smaller frame) if you needed to email a short clip, but the color banding would probably be objectionable for most other uses.If you are using VirtualDub and/or AVISynth for your video processing, you are probably already aware that these tools will not load MOV files with the codecs and plugins they come with. I tried a dozen different plugins and 4 codec packs and could not get my 60D MOV files to load into VirtualDub.  I have finally found two solutions that work:  a. a small freeware video converter called \"MP4Cam2AVI\" version 2.98.  This is a very simple program that does only one thing, and does it well: it repackages MOV files into AVI files, either losslessly (without re-encoding either the video or audio), or, you can optionally re-encode the video to XVID MP4 and the audio to MP3. It even lets you configure XVID's bitrate and maximum keyframe intervals!  I chose the \"no-re-encode\" option. The processing was extremely fast, only a few seconds for a 250 megabyte MOV file, and the output AVI was exactly the same size as the original MOV, so no loss of data. Best of all, it loaded into VirtualDub first time, with no problems or error messages, and I was then able to do any kind of editing I wanted.  Another nice feature of this software is that it is stand-alone (portable), and does not require \"installation\" into Windows, so it doesn't fool with Windows  registry, and it will run from a flash drive or CD/DVD.  To download it, Google \"MP4Cam2AVI\". I found it on SoftPedia.  b. Pazera Free MOV2AVI Converter. This software offers similar features to MP4Cam2AVI, but the user interface is a little simpler. It also has a good File Info feature.UPDATE December 2012. I now have a 70-200 f2.8L USM lens.  On my first field trip with it, to Death Valley National Park last month, I tried some night photography.  It was a moonless night and I was able to get some very nice shots of the starlit sky over the Amargosa Range. However, I discovered a problem with night photography with the 60D and autofocus EF lenses: If the subject is so dark that the camera's focus sensors can't detect anything to focus on, the camera will refuse to open the shutter.  It won't even operate on BULB setting. I looked through every menu setting and made certain that the camera and the lens were both set up for full manual exposure and focus control, and nothing I tried would let me make an exposure, on BULB or any other shutter speed, with the new 70-200 lens if the scene illumination was extremely dark. I finally replaced the 70-200 with my Rokinon 85mm f1.4, a non-electronic, full-manual lens, and the camera then let me take BULB exposures.  I can't explain this except to assume that the camera's operating system has apparently been programmed to work this way.  It was disappointing that I could not use my best lens to capture the night sky shots that I wanted.UPDATE May 2013. I have just discovered an issue with converting the camera's MOV video files to AVI: you lose all of the metadata!  If you view the File Info of your MOV videos in Canon Zoom Browser or Digital Photo Professional, you will see that all of usual \"shooting info\" is embedded in the file header (Time, Date, Lens, Aperture, Shutter Speed, Owner Name, etc). Unfortunately, none of the MOV to AVI video conversion programs I have tried preserve this metadata. The only workaround I have found is to export the \"shooting info\" for each video you plan toconvert, as a Text file, from Zoom Browser, and name the text file the same as the photo.  There may be some program out there that append Exif Metadata to an AVI but I haven't found one yet.Also, be forewarned that setting the Movie Recording exposure mode to \"Auto\" will allow the camera to set whatever ISO speed it wants to; this may turn out to be very high in low light situations, 3200 for example, which will result in very noisy image quality.  If you want to retain control of the ISO setting, you have to set Movie Recording Exposure Mode to \"Manual\", then experiment with shutter speed and aperture settings to get the exposure level you want.  If you have the camera on a tripod, don't forget to turn off the Image Stabilizer, otherwise you will actually hear it as a buzzing noise in the video.", "Date": "February 26, 2012"}, {"Title": "Solid Camera", "Author": "Michael Rosenberg \"Cabal\"", "ReviewID": "R2H1PS135P09WY", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Received the EOS 60d about 2 weeks ago.  This is my first DSLR.  I have had many point and shoot digital Canon cameras over the years and was pretty happy with them, but my wife and I are having a baby in 6 months and wanted a better quality camera that did stills and video.  I went back and forth for weeks between the T2i and the Nikon D90 before finally settling on the 60D.  The reason I choose it over the T2i was the bigger size, all nine AF points are cross type sensors, the articulating (high res) LCD, burst speed (5.3 FPS vs 3.7FPS), Pentaprism vs Pentamirror viewfinder, and the kit lens (28mm-135mm).  I almost choose the D90 which is a very good camera, but it didn't support SDXC cards and the video modes are not as good. The 60d is newer technology and I wanted to future proof as much as I could.  Luckily for me I had $500 worth of gift cards so I didn't pay the full price of the camera out of pocket.  It cost $1299.99 on Amazon at the time I purchased it.  I am very happy with the camera. I have not had time to take advantage of all the cool features yet, but I will. There is so much that I can do with this camera I know it will last me for years and years.

Creel", "ReviewID": "R1VS9SSAOY6JPW", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I had been looking at the Canon 60D kit with the 18-135 lens for several months on Amazon, trying to get to the point to spend $1199 on a camera when the price jumped up to $1299 on the combo unit.  I suspect the nuclear plant problems in Japan were the reason for the price hike.  But my local Best Buy had an ad that didn't expire until the end of the week with the same combo for $1199 plus 6.5% tax and I purchased the 60D locally from Best Buy.  I prefer doing business with Amazon, but I saved $30 or so (though I paid $70 or so more than if I had gone ahead and bought from Amazon a week earlier) plus got instant gratification.  Several of the other reviews referred to the need to read the owner's manual, which I have been doing for several weeks now.  I'm still working in the \"programmed\" modes, learning how to use the camera, and trying to increase my skill level in using this equipment.  I have subsequently bought a 50mm F1.8 Canon lens, extra lens caps, straps, UV filters, 2 16GB class 10 SD cards, and lens cap retainers from Amazon.  My photography days go back to 1964 with an Asahi Pentax SLR Spotmatic with 50mm, 28mm, 135mm, and 300mm lenses (a Spotmatic is in the Kodak Museum in Rochester, NY) and a Strobonar flash....I am truly a dinosaur with long film experience in 35mm and medium format cameras.I do a lot of work in courthouse records and archival records and the flip-out screen is almost a necessity.  My two previous cameras (both Sonys) were selected for that one attribute.  The Canon 60D's flip-out screen has a very good image.IMO, the Canon 60D is the best piece of equipment I've ever owned, so far.  My previous, now backup, camera is a six-year-old Sony R1 (10MP high level point and shoot)... a really good piece of equipment.. which now feels less than acceptable.  My initial test shots were of a blue heron about 150 feet across a canal and I could enlarge the images to clearly see his iris in the eye.  I then put the camera on the \"program\" mode for sports and made a noise to cause the heron to fly.  The camera started taking shots and didn't stop until I let go of the button..just flat amazing!  The only \"minus\" I have found is the diopter adjustment.. it doesn't go as far as I really need and I'll purchase a converter lens to adapt to my left eye.. a really nit-picking \"minus\" and not applicable to most folks, I believe.It's now apparent that I'm going to have to get a \"Canon\" tattoo somewhere because I've become a believer....  I suspect I've bought more camera than I really need and would have been very happy with the T3i.. but I'm just very happy with the Canon 60D.

I mean extensively to the point where I re read all reviews online, examined the footage and pics presented, found a friend with a 60D and tested it myself, cross referenced other cameras in it's range and then made an easy decision to buy Canon's offering. Here are my findings:1. The 60D is a sturdy well built camera which will instill confidence in it's user...unless you throw cameras off a cliff for a living!The body having a metal chassis and over layed with a polycarbonate and fiberglass resin mix feels tough in your hands, can take a beating, can be slightly banged, can take a fall, but don't slam it to the ground and expect everything to be 100%...it might be 99%. It's designed to take some weathering as well, a sprinkle here and there, and dust blown at it, but no heavy rainfall or sand storm.If you've used a rebel series, it's much tougher than those.2. It's size and ergonomics are perfect for anyone with medium to large size hands, even small hands too.The rebel is a small size camera, so at first this camera felt a bit big. As the hour progressed I realized how well balanced it felt, no longer over powered by my hands, not too big, JUST RIGHT. I have medium sized hands. The camera itself has sufficient weight to balance lenses well on it's own, not throwing the camera back or forward. In fact it felt like the bigger the lens the more \"well balanced\" it became. You see the 60D is not TOO HEAVY. I've read of some people's complaint, that the 60D is not heavy as compared to the 50D or 7D...I'm not sure if people have an obsession with carrying lots of weight around, but when you're like me shooting for several hours, you easily begin to adore how comfortable, yet well balanced the 60D is, especially if you go on hikes or trips where the camera hangs on your neck for some time.3. Ergonomics: the 60D has ALMOST but not everything controlled by your right hand, this is well thought through and wise. Even more so, when I had to use my left hand to turn it ON or OFF as well as turn the DIAL MODE, FLASH, LENS RELEASE and use the THRASH, I totally understood why they were placed where they are. These five moves are not to be guessed or happen by mistake, so allowing the left hand to come into play here turns out to be wise, and left my right hand not feeling totally sore as it was sometimes left with the rebel ( which is right hand dependent). My right thumb no longer searches on the back of the camera for buttons, here the layout is simplified with this new SCROLL WHEEL, and MULTI DIRECTIONAL PAD, which being a closely paired unit allowed me to stop searching when my eye was on the view finder. As well as the DRIVE, ISO, METERING, and AF buttons had me very certain as to what I was pressing without looking at them, all under a couple of hours.  My one issue though with respect to the THRASH button is that you must confidently press it to get it activated, even when trying to delete photos one at a time but many altogether. This however may turn out to save me from easily deleting wanted media!4. IMAGE QUALITY IS AMAZING, even on the kit lens. Now I've tried the Canon's 50mm F1.8 prime, this is an amazing lens for quality, at a low price, also the 18-55mmIS, 28-135mm IS, 55-250mm IS, 35mm prime and the 18MP stands out and shines. I clearly understand the difference between a 10MP rebel XS and the 60D.  I also understand a good lens makes a big difference, as the 50mm f1.8 is a far better quality lens under low light and depth of field image quality when compared to the 18-55mm kit lens. However the 18-55mm delivers excellent images and handles extremely well when shooting video especially in low light. At the end of the day a good lens makes the difference, but the image quality of the 60D will match with the 7D, and beat it's rivals when it comes to colour, and low light images.5. The Creative Filters suite is a master class of an addition to the camera's internal software. It gives a dimension to images only offered in pc editing, all done on the 60D. As well as the In CAMERA RAW EDITING feature. On the rebel XS, I never quite appreciated the RAW  files, as I wanted to fix my images on the go, and have as much work done when the images were uploaded to my MAC. The 60D has not been heralded as it ought to for incorporating this new software where many aspects of a RAW file can be easily edited in the camera on the go. After which the images can be further sweetened using the creative filter suite. These additions now have me yearning to  shoot in RAW  so I can tweak my images for creativity. Truly an enthusiasts camera. A creative mind would love this machine.6. BATTERY LIFE IS INCREDIBLE. So i shot for an hour today, well over 350  FLASH pics, and 10 minutes of video, 20 minutes of video editing, and my battery at 70%. I'm suggesting here that I will get more than 1400 pics on one battery (Canon states about 1600). So hands down this camera will make do on a world tour easily!7. So the BURST RATE surprised me a bit, coming from a 3fps on a rebel to a 5.3fps on the 60D, I jumped when the shutter started eating up shots, at one point it was simply too many shots to ever be used, and the children playing in front of the camera didn't seem to move any more. 5.3FPS is simply enough, well for me at least. I realized some people in their reviews complain about features they may NEVER EVER truly use. So loosing 1 FPS from the 50D or not having 8FPS compared to the 7D, I'm glad I didn't pay extra for it.8. TILTY SWIVELLY ARTICULATED SCREEN is the best. OK so you can't beat this feature, it's worth paying for. It sets this camera apart from the 7D, 50D, in fact almost every other DSLR except the T3i (at this time of writing). Canon 60D wins with the ability to shoot OVERHEAD, UNDERHAND, SELF IMAGES, TRIPOD SHOTS. This is where the moonwalk comes out for the 60D, and it's Pentaprism LCD screen works well. The glare in midday sun did affect a little bit, but just a wee bit little, as the colours shone through easily even with the glare.So a 3 inch screen is big enough, you see all you'll ever need for a camera at this stage in life, unless they install a t.v. You can easily tell where you loose focus, or where shadows are. Aspect ratio ruler guides really are practical on this screen, canon really packed features into this camera.IF I were to point out issues with this camera to date they would be:1. LCD screen may need a screen protector, as it easily traps finger prints. However it cleans easily with a standard camera cloth.2. The onboard built in microphone for sound recording is average to sub par at times. It's not bad when the surroundings are not too noisy, it's good for catching audio for reference. It's not the audio quality to match with the amazing images this camera produces. It does a \"just decent\" enough job. But that's why canon has a 3.5mm LINE IN, so you go professional aftermarket.Other than this I would again advise buyers that a great lens makes a world of difference. So understand your needs carefully before you buy a lens, so you know what Focal lengths you need. When you get to use this camera with a good or great lens it makes you yearn for more, you just want to shoot and shoot. It's image quality is that great! It's video mode is that enticing.The Canon 60D is a workhorse in disguise of an enthusiasts camera.

If I knew then what I know now, I'd probably have two 60Ds. The relatively small difference in size & weight really doesn't come close in describing the much more robust feel when handling the 60D. It truly feels like a pro camera, although it's not quite considered a professional model.

Size and build. I purchased the T3i - I have larger hands then some girls but no bigger then a normal guy- and I just felt completely cramped. The T3i felt chintzy and like a toy. The 60d has some weight- doesn't feel like it is going to break - and most importantly to me, has the wheel on the back that allows you to change setting without having to look at the screen (or even the on camera display.) The T3i had these horrible little arrows that you have to press that made me feel arthritic. Also- the 60d shoots fast. Though I think the sensor is probably comparable if not the same- I just could not see myself ever feeling comfortable using a T3i like I am with the 60d. I previously owned the 40d- and loved it- the 60d has only improved by adding video and a flip out screen. It is an excellent camera- the battery lasts and lasts and the camera just makes sense and feels good.

The main reason why I chose a DSLR for commercials is the quality you get with the large DSLR sensor and lens, and how portable they are. I was looking at the 7D but went down to the 60D because they both have the same 18MP sensor, the 60D has manual audio controls (7D doesn't), 60D has the tilt/swivel screen, and one thing that isn't put out there is the 60D has a much smoother exposure adjustment when zooming during videos compared to the 7D, so you can actually get away with slow zooms with a variable aperture lens without the harsh exposure adjustments.I have shot a few commercials so far and the quality is amazing. I had used a Sony HVR-V1U before and the difference is definitely worth the investment. The Canon 60D is really great in low light, has great color and contrast, a really nice shallow DOF, an all-digital work flow, and my favorite thing over standard video cameras is I can use any lens I have to make a shot possible. No need for wide angle adapters that distort your image and degrade quality, I just swap out the lens for a wide angle lens. And that even gives you the chance to get great video in even LOWER light conditions with all of the low F-stop lenses out there.As for the photography side it is also great. The kit lens works quite well, the high ISO capabilities are really helpful and the noise isn't too bad, the AF engine works really well (I actually like it more than the new one found on the 7D), and the on board art filters are pretty cool. Continuous shooting is fast but not as fast as the 7D, but I can take that hit for the improved video functionality.Overall if you're looking for a DSLR and want to do a lot of video work on top of photography, I would suggest the 60D more than the 7D or 550D (T2i) by far. It is a great camera and for half the price of a professional camcorder you get better a much higher quality image.P.S. - One thing some people don't know about filming with a DSLR is they can overheat if you continuously film (live events) and will shut off to protect themselves. Files are limited to 4GB a piece (about 10 min), so if you want to do live event videography I would not suggest a DSLR. But if you're doing scripted material with multiple takes, where you can just stop and start another file, you should have no issues.", "Date": "December 27, 2010"}, {"Title": "Canon 60D,  a truly Magnificent Camera, a True Super Rebel", "Author": "Roger James \"Doc\"", "ReviewID": "RHBXATCGXZ9IC", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I think the Canon 60d is a magnificent camera. It takes great images in even the most difficult settings. It has a wonderful grip which makes it very comfortable and secure to hold.  It does not weigh too much with the basic 18-55 kit lens but with longer zooms it is a handful.  It focuses very quickly, stores the image quickly on a high speed SD card (you buy) The high speed capture allows 5 shots per second.  The many options available make even the most difficult to take images, possible.  I rated this camera 5 stars because it is a true 5 star super Rebel camera that has everything any non pro could ever want. It is missing some of the great new features that have been added to the Canon T4i and newer Canon T5i like the fabulous touch screen LCD.You do get a full user manual unlike the standard rebels. This is very helpful and it is small enough to carry in a dSLR bag.  Right now, Amazon is selling the body for almost half the price I paid for my original Rebel and it is an good bargain. Many will be tempted to buy the newer T4i model which now is about the same price. The t4i may have some newer features and better video performance so it may be a very difficult decision for some to choose which way to go.  If you are a beginner looking at this camera for your first purchase of a dSLR, may not a good choice.  I would stick with an entry level Canon or Nikon dSLR camera because it will take just as good images and be much easier to learn the basics. I think you can learn faster with a more simplified interface and lighter camera. If you find you really love photography, it will be much easier the second time around to choose a more competent camera which will have more features and will probably cost less to buy in the future.The Canon 60d matched with a nice lens, is possible to get superior images of macro objects, very low light scenes with image quality not possible with the smaller sensor cameras.  However, I must admit now, I will not take this camera on a trip because of total weight with lenses and body.  This is always a personal decision everyone has to make when packing for a trip. I find a super zoom (bridge camera) like the Canon SX50, or the Panasonic FZ200 and subcompacts such as Canon S95 or S110 are easier to take anywhere and allow more candid photos.Things I like about the Canon 60D which are not available with the entry level Ti series.1. Extra info LCD display on top, which gives extra helpful info but not easy to see in dark setting,it has weak light which helps a little2. Great button placement and many individual controls for ISO, Drive, exposure, etc3. Better and brighter viewfinder with pentaprism.4. Wireless flash control,  more flash options5. Q menu allow quick change of functions... T4i has this with touch screen6. Longer battery life. Can take a huge number of images, 500 plus before needing to recharge battery7. Many more custom settings allowed. They can easily be reset8. Electronic level helps keep horizon level, helpful especially when on tripod.9. Many extra features and options in the menu system.10. Better grip, camera is larger and easier to handle especially with a larger lens.11.  Better build quality than entry level or ti series.12.  Some weather sealing but not pro level. More robust than ti series but less than pro models which have magnesium frames. This doesn't have it.13.  Very fast focusing and display14.  Many more options than available to entry level models.Things not so great. I am struggling to find complaints, so here are a few weak arguments.1.  60D has not been updated for almost 2 years. a new model will be out soon.2.  Camera is larger and heavier than ti series.3.  The LCD display is difficult to view in some lighting situations, could be larger4.  No touch screen, gps, or other newer features found on newer cameras which might be on upgraded model at a higher price.Canon wisely steered this model to the Amateur who wants a little more Camera but does not need a professional model with Magnesium frame and fully weatherproofed with a giant sensor, extra processors, and a camera that can be used and abused. The 60D uses a poly-carbonate frame like the other rebels. It's strong enough and tough enough for 97% of us taking pictures. It probably has enough to satisfy anyone maybe even the pros who may chose to buy it as a second or third body.If you are trying to decide whether to buy this camera over the T4i, the T4i has the edge because it has been upgraded to have many newer capabilities beyond the Canon 60D. The advanced amateur, semipro, and pro would probably be better off with the 60D primarily because of better ergonomics, build quality, weather sealing, better viewfinder and more customization. The novice photographer to advanced photographer might be better of with the T41 with its many great new features. Both take great images with  a good lens (glass).What lenses to buy?The kit lens is OK starter lens and has the advantage of cost and lightness. Choosing a good lens is probably the most difficult decision in photography. The kit lenses offered by Canon for their cameras are a good start. Buying the Canon F1.8 is a no brainer because it's the best buy in lenses today.This review is about the Canon 60D but I mentioned the T4i which I also bought. You may wonder which I like better. I haven't decided yet because they are both great cameras and you can't go wrong with either.

I was not tied to either system. Based on the INCREDIBLE reviews of the Nikon, I went for it. I will not discuss its performance here--we all know how good it is, and it IS--but I'd like you to know why I eventually returned this camera and purchased the 60D.THE GRIP: Though the D7000 has a very nice, deep indent, and appears taller than the 60D, it is not wider, and that seems to have made a world of difference for me. My hands are a \"normal\" size I suppose (I'm 5'8\") and when holding the D7000, my pinky ALWAYS gravitated to the bottom/base plate of the camera. A solid camera to hold, yes, but I still could never get over this. My hand never felt comfortable while holding it. The 60D, however, has a beefier grip. It's more rounded, which allows more of my hand/fingers to stretch over the grip. Very comfortable, and I never think about how to hold the camera. A little off topic here, but while the Nikon is (partial) magnesium alloy, and has a terrific weight and solid feel, I do not believe the Canon suffers much in comparison. It's also solid in build, feels wonderful to hold, and has a well-balanced weight. Edge to Nikon, but build quality should absolutely NOT deter you from buying the Canon. It's excellent.MENUS/BUTTONS: The 60D is brilliant. I know 40/50D owners and MK owners will beg to differ, but I find the right-side placement of buttons to be outstanding. I use my thumb, and that's it. I rarely have to hold the camera with 2 hands for any setting switch. And while it loses some external buttons to the menus, I find this to be incredibly picky. Aside from still having the ability to assign custom functions, the Q menu button is idiot-proof and welcome, as I can get to my frequently-used setting fast (I LOVE the Q!). It is true the buttons are not as responsive-feeling as the D7000's, but I have never had a problem getting from function-to-function, and as quickly as I would like to. As far as menus go, I much prefer Canon's to Nikon's. Though both are excellent, very bright, quick and comprehensive, I like how you can move to a folder and see EVERYTHING in that folder in a single screen display without scrolling down, as is the case with the D7000. With the Canon, if what you're looking for is not in that menu, just move to the next tab. No scrolling that goes on and on.BOTTOM LINE and the LESSON: It came down to the grip and menu layout for me. Spend time with the cameras you're looking into. Lots of time. No one is going to boot you out of the store for taking too long in making a decision that will cost you--and benefit the store--over a grand. I wish I did this initially, instead of purchasing-and-returning, but ultimately, having owned (the Nikon, briefly) both cameras, I have no regrets. Image quality is terrific in both cameras, but equally important, if not more so, is ergonomics.

It costs a measly $900-$1000 depending on where you buy it -- I say measly, but only relatively to other cameras. This puts it just before the Canon 7D. I was skeptical at first, because the tilt-screen was a new feature back then. I was under the impression that the screen would be fragile, but it is actually far from it.This camera, in my opinion, is the most versatile -- in terms of features -- camera that one can buy. It does everything well, including video. Video recording is made extremely easy with the tilt-screen, and although I didn't buy the camera for its video capabilities, I am now glad that it has them.Noise performance, picture quality, and ergonomics are fantastic. Once you learn how to use this camera, you can do it with one hand. All of the settings that one would ever want to change have their own dedicated button -- except white balance... sadly. Everything else is programmable to a custom menu that will give you quick access when you're out shooting. And although this camera does NOT have a dedicated white balance button, you can program it to the SET button, which is located in the center of the D-Pad.All in all, I would say this is a fantastic camera, BUT, there are a few drawbacks:After around two years of use, I have realized how much I would have LOVED for this camera to be weather-sealed. Every now and then I get caught up in rain or snow, and I always worry about my camera -- so far the 60D has tanked through several snow and rain storms.My second desire for this camera would have been for some different body construction materials. The polycarbon-fiber resin, or what-have you, is great, but I would still prefer the sturdiness of an aluminum body.So, would I recommend this to a friend? Definitely. For $600 cheaper, you essentially get a 7D without the aluminum body, weather sealing, and slightly faster shutter speed, but everything else is absolutely the same.

During this time I've clicked off nearly 1900 photos. I took it to Indianapolis to photograph and video record events at the Percussive Arts Socity International Convention; I've photographed two concerts; I photographed the LoneStar Classic drumline competition; I shot a wedding; and I shot a family's Christmas photos. That's a pretty good workout for a new camera.What works?* Pretty much everything. The AF, metering, high ISO noise suppression, speed, image quality, etc. are superb.* Off-camera flash capability. It works easily and flawlessly (error below notwithstanding). It is far more convenient than using cable or RF triggers.* Body. The robustness of the body makes this worth every penny over the price of a T3i/600D. I used it in a moderate rain storm without worrying about it being damaged by a smattering of H20. The grip is perfect for my large hands. The shutter just sounds so tight and solid. It is heavy enough that it feels steady and solid, yet light enough that it is easy to manage. It is a nice counterbalance to the weight of the EF-S 17-55mm f/2.8 IS USM lens that I primarily use.* Dials and buttons. Several reviews maligned the vague feeling buttons and condemned the eight-way rocker control. This \"shortcoming\" is much ado about nothing.* SD memory card. So far I have discovered nothing to hate about using these SD cards. I was prepared for the worst. This feature made me hold my nose when I purchased this camera. I wanted CF memory cards like my other DSLR. It's no big deal. I would have been buying new larger capacity cards for the new camera anyway.* Batteries and battery monitor. These batteries seem to go forever. I've only had to recharge them once. That was just prior to shooting the wedding. At that point each battery had more than 25% capacity left after shooting about 1000 photos, many with a flash. After shooting the wedding, each battery is only about 25% depleted.What doesn't?* Live view is quite limited for taking photographs. While it's great to be able to swing out and tilt the LCD when taking a photograph with arms extended above your head, it is really quite slow and has a hard time focusing. I'll only be able to use it for static shots. It is unusable for photojournalist-style shooting of a mass of people moving around, such as of people dancing at a wedding reception.* Error: \"This option not available when external flash connected.\" On Saturday while shooting the family, I removed the flash and attempted to use the off-flash feature when I started getting this error. The camera would not let me open the internal flash for the same reason. I was really quite frustrated. Eventually I had an assistant hold a reflector and I bounced the flash into it from the shoe. I later discovered the problem is a tiny switch located under the right hot shoe rail that was stuck in the down position. Apparently this is a common Canon problem. I'm glad I know how to easily fix this should it happen again, but I would have been furious if this had happened at a fast moving wedding.* White balance. Actually, I can't say this doesn't work. It just doesn't work well all the time. I couldn't get the WB right at the wedding. In the future I may pack a white card so I can custom set the WB for difficult situations like that.

The panel also has amazing resolution and can be zoomed during reviews of pictures so that you can get a good feel for the focus of your shot and whatever noise may be present as you push the limits of aperture, shutter speed, etc.I don't regret this purchase at all, except that as I see what it can do, my interest in photography is being further piqued, so now my wish list for more paraphernalia (remote flash, lenses, filters, etc.) is growing, which means spending more money.", "Date": "November 2, 2011"}, {"Title": "upgraded to 60D from t2i", "Author": "Fotoflix \"openCL master\"", "ReviewID": "R21FID5MCLCL9B", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I mainly upgraded to the 60D for the ergonomics and found over the last few months that the flip out screen is great when put away in order to protect the screen.

The 19point AF radically improves the performance of even some of my slower lenses like my tokina 12-24mm f/4 and tamron 28-75mm f/2.8, the latter of which ive been using less and less because of the painful focus time and both of which have slow motors (both are first versions), as well as the tiny viewfinder on the XTi which deters me from manual focusing.  But now with such an accurate and quick AF, even the slow motor gives me quick enough focus speed that the lens becomes usuable in lower light settings, and the viewfinder + live view (esp quick liveview) gives me so much more flexibility.The flip screen is pretty cool, though i haven't had THAT much use for it.The only reason why I voted down one star is some random interface stuff that annoys me.  I understand the idea behind the wheel lock on the left side, but it's harder to be quick to switch between different program modes like M and Video.

When the 60D body price dropped to under $900 in November, i quickly sold my XS and ordered this fine camera.  To be honest, i didn't do much research before I ordered it so i never bothered to compare it to the 7D but the spending an extra $400 for the 7D didn't fly with my wife so i \"settled\" on the 60D.  After ordering it, i jumped onto the dpreview forums to see what people were saying about the 60D.  The 2 things that i saw the most discussion about was the plastic body and the lack of micro-adjust.When i finally received my camera and mounted my Tamron 17-50mm and was astonished at how solid the camera felt in my hands.  Maybe it's b/c i have never held a magnesium body but i couldn't imagine how it could feel anymore solid.  The XS truly feels like a toy after holding the 60D.  I have never once dropped my XS in the 2 years i owned it so i don't really worry that i'll be dropping the 60D.  As for the micro-adjust, i never had it on my XS so i don't really know what i'm missing.  i'm sure it's a nice feature to have but i'm not missing it.  i guess ignorance is bliss in my case.Prior to the 60D being announced, the 50D was the camera i was planning to buy.  When the 60D was released with the vari-angle LCD screen, i was truly sold. One of the features I miss from my old Canon Pro1 is the flip out LCD screen so i was really excited when i saw the 60D.

I was mainly worried about the move away from the Magnesium Alloy body, but it really doesn't seem to be that big of a deal for me since I'm usually not roughing it when taking photos.  Overall, the camera feels very similar to all other X0D's that have come before it.Photo quality and video quality is A+.  Can't go wrong there.  It's the same sensor that's in the 7D and T2i.

More autofocus points would have been nice, but I'm good with what this camera provides.The only real con, and this is true of all curren Canon SLRs that shoot video or that have live mode, is that there is poor live-view auto focus.  It's slow.  It's almost annoyingly slow.  I don't use auto-focus when shooting photos, so it's not that big of a deal.  BUT...for videos, it's pretty dreadful.  Since there is no continuous auto-focus, shooting certain scenes require using manual focus.  It's definitely not like shooting with a camcorder.  If you're shooting serious footage and are more into shooting cinematic style shots (fix focal length clips), then this is not a big deal.  If you want to shoot family videos, it's okay, but don't expect to zoom in on something in the middle of recording and have the camera automatically focus the subject for you.

In 1990, I graduated to a serious Nikon film camera and two quality lenses, a standard zoom and a telephoto zoom.  Reluctantly, as the digital chatter started to fill most camera club discussions and magazines, I started to experiment with two advanced digital point-and-shoot cameras with a minimum of 10X optical zooms... each for a period of 4 years.  The die was cast at that point, and I sadly found a storage spot for my beloved film gear.  The second of the point-and-shoots was the Canon PowerShot S5 IS with the articulating LCD screen.  I cannot begin to tell you the value of an articulating digital LCD screen that allows you to capture an eye level image of a blossom without the need to sit on the ground to do so.  Or, capture several hours worth of a full lunar eclipse with a tripod mounted camera at a nearly overhead celestial body.  That tilted screen made the job easier and saved lots of neck pain. So, from 2009 through the end of January (2011), I labored over which DSLR/lens combinations would take my \"mad money\".  Being a Nikon man carried the ball, but I wanted that articulating LCD screen.  Like buying a car, sometimes the little things carry the day.On February 1, 2011, I became the proud owner of a Canon DSLR.  I purchased the Canon 60D body and two Canon \"L\" lenses: the f4 24-105mm IS USM standard zoom and the f2.8L 70-200mm IS II USM telephoto zoom.  Sure, the camera body was significant, but lens quality takes your images to the NEXT level. I was confident with the decision, and now after a month of serious practice with the 60D/lens combinations, I am getting VERY satisfying image quality...sharp or soft depending on the subject.  Not only does the camera body have the necessary articulating LCD screen, it allows me as much control as I choose...from full auto to standard settings, to the zone where I live...aperature-priority and shutter-priority.  Living along the Atlantic Flyway, February can be a challenging month weather-wise but the Canon 60D and the lenses proved to be up to the task, especially when the first and last hours of light give you some truly spectacular wildlife opportunities and remarkable sunrises and sunsets.Just know that I don't spend my money recklessly and I expect results when I put my money down.  Without a doubt, this camera body passed the February test in all kinds of lighting and temperatures ranging from 15 degrees to 65 degrees.

The T2i and the 60D have been my first Canon cameras. I didn't like the T2i for stills, in fact, I stopped using it and it became a video camera only.For video, the T2i was great. It's small, light and easy to use, but for stills, I could never get the metering to play nicely without a lot of fiddling. Sometimes I'd just fire off shots and preview until I got it working right. I found it erratic and cumbersome.Now I'm sure part of that is switching Nikon to Canon. However, I've had none of those issues with the 60D. The ergonomics are great. It does what I want it to, when I want it to. The buttons are easy to get to and allow fast changing of ISO, metering type, etc. The top LCD screen is also a great addition that makes a big difference for stills.I loved my T2i, but I'm even more in love with the 60D; the ergonomics are better, no AGC and the killer feature (ironically) is that it's a great stills camera too.", "Date": "January 9, 2011"}, {"Title": "Looking at the Cyber Monday price", "Author": "MiannaJo", "ReviewID": "R155YCIT7D271S", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Wow, what a cyber day deal.

What I like most is the articulating LCD screen which I use frequently when shooting in Live View mode. When shooting a fast prime lens wide open, the depth of field is tight and focus is critical - I use the LCD in Live View, zoom in on the target, make a final focusing adjustment, and the result is perfect every time.The Canon 18-200mm f/3.5-5.6 kit lens is my everyday lens on this camera, and although I like the range from 18 to 200mm, it's a pretty slow piece of glass. Two things help compensate: 1) The lens' image stabilization, and 2) The camera's high ISO & long exposure noise reduction technology.Dislikes? The only one is a delay in writing data to the memory card when shooting RAW + large JPG mode with noise reduction turned on. It essentially doubles the image write time, regardless of the speed of your card.

After all, it was the first body to do away with the magnesium alloy for plastic.. OH NO!  Actually, I think it saved some weight, and who throws around their camera gear anyway?  I do, actually.  I am a professional wedding photographer, and sometimes I have to shed one setup for another quickly.  Yet, this baby was a great, inexpensive backup to my 7D, and complement to our full frame 5D II rigs.As far as the focusing system is concerned, sometimes fewer AF points are a better option.  For instance, when shooting in low light with a shallow depth of field at f1.2,  I would much rather have the quickness of selecting a single point from just 9 instead of the 19 on the 7D.  And the difference between image quality in the two bodies is negligible in my opinion.  Plus the swivel screen comes in handy when creating more artistic angles from on the floor or up very high, shooting over someones shoulder, etc.  I wish the full frame cameras from Canon offered the swivel screen.In all, this is a camera that works well for the amateur who wants to put the camera in auto mode and shoot away, to the seasoned pro who is looking for a quick draw, low-light, artistic shot.

I love being able to change settings without having to have my eye at the viewfinder or using the LCD Quick Menu.  The AF system is so much better than the Rebels (other than T4i).

So the packaging is great.Anyways, that is not the point of Amazon reviews.This is basically my first DSLR camera, after using a rebel for a few months a few years ago. I wanted something a little cheaper than the EOS 7D, but with more growing room and a little more solid than the Rebel since I live at high altitude/high humidity/rain every darn day jungle environment that is tough on things. Plus I'm clumsy as hell.Since I am not an expert or even advanced photographer by any means, I will focus on usability from a beginner's perspective.First of all, ergonomically, the camera is a good fit. (for my hands anyways). I can reach all the important knobs and dials easily by touch with my eye to the view finder. Would be nice if there was a way to change the white balance mode without going into the quick menu. I suppose there may be and I just haven't been able to find it. But that is kind of a pain since I am all over the place taking photos in differently lighted environments.The menus are logical and not that confusing. It is pretty easy to find the settings you want to adjust, and if you don't understand the setting, it is pretty easy to find in the manual. Again, this is my first DSLR so I am not used to any different type of menu arrangement.I was a little worried about the design of the adjustable LCD since I am in a remote location and could not physically look at this camera anywhere before the purchase (Which is why I purchase from Amazon, of course). Suffice to say that the design is solid and unless you fell down on the thing, I don't think you'd break it very easily.I will not bother commenting on image quality, as I am not qualified to comment. I'll just say that I am extremely satisfied at the images coming out of this camera, even on \"fully automatic.\" I am still learning how to properly use this camera to it's real potential in the more manual modes, and plan to update this review as I go.I also highly recommend a book I purchased with this camera for anyone who is a beginner like me:Canon EOS 60D: From Snapshots to Great Shots", "Date": "August 27, 2012"}, {"Title": "Excellent CANON 60D", "Author": "Michael DiDomenico", "ReviewID": "R2NLCCUJ0JUZIZ", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I finally made the decision to upgrade my camera. I am using a CANON T2i/550D and even though I love this smaller camera, I wanted more. The decision took me about a month of reading, asking questions and then going to my local store and actually seeing the 60D & 7D. I decided on the 60D and I have not looked back. The first things I noticed was the size compared to the T2i, Yea it's bigger, but it also feels better built.The swivel LCD screen is something that I had seen on the T3i, but I wanted something other than that, if I was going to add another Body. The swivel screen has been a help in allowing me to take photo's and video's in crowded places or in a museum when there was no place to stand by myself. The video is the same quality as my Rebel T2i, but shoots in .MOV. I am going to find software to convert the .MOV files.The biggest items that caught my eye  were the AF process of using all 9 AF points for cross focusing to give you a better focusing image and more flexibility. The T2i only had the center point as a cross focus point.The quick control screen allows for using different ambient shooting in certain modes like CA, Portrait, Landscape, Close-up, Sport and Night Portrait. This allows you to select the different Ambience you want the photo to take. I have tried these and it is amazing the differences it makes to the photo. I took the same shot over and over and the results were very good, and each Ambience has 3 setting levels. Also included are the Creative filters for changing the look of the photo while still in the camera.The next option that I found useful was setting up the continuous shooting function. There are 2 choices: Low-speed [3fps] and High-speed [5.3fps] so you have the ability to select what you feel is good for where you are. Certain scene modes can use these options, but others cannot. Portrait is Low-speed and Sport is only High-speedThe camera focuses quickly, and the photo's are outstanding. When I get a bad photo, I can check in Photoshop and see what my setting were and then I can blame myself for the bad photo. I am still on the battery charge from when I bought the camera and that is about 1,500 photo's ago. It is very easy to make changes as this camera has most of the same settings as the T2i, in the way you make the changes. I really like the top mounted LCD screen for when I want to make a quick change to AF mode, ISO, Drive mode and  when in P, Av, Tv, M modes.On the CON side is Live Mode, as it is slower and not a good option for me. I am not a fan of this, so it is strictly personal.It is now the middle of July and about 3,000 photo's later. I am even more impressed and I am enjoying using the AEB setup for making HDR photo's. The camera just keeps impressing me. OH, the video's that I make are really very good and the 1080P HD video's look like a real movie. I have added and external mic from Nikon [ME-1] and is adds to the video's.November 2012Just returned from a 20 day vacation in Europe and I must say this about this camera. It is truly amazing, as I took over 4,500 photo's and about 30 video's without one hiccup at all. I am so impressed at the quality of my photo.

I held 60D in my hands at local bestbuy store and it felt very heavy(also due to wierd attachments to base of camera).I went ahead and ordered my 60D, hoping for good. And it turns out to be BEST!!. Weight is very ideal, grip is very nice(I don't have big hands) and much better than T3i(tried at store) or my T1i. Camera though plastic(as mostly said) feels solid and should hold good for years of normal use. Out of box picture quality is amazing and a leap from my old T1i. I am not fan of in-built flash use and that's where 60D gives me advantage of clicking without flash in low light, pictures are turning out to be great(without flash if you mind :) ).Couple more quick things that I appreciate over Rebel's:1) Most settings are visible on screen and not hidden under menu. Less fumbling.2) Focusing is quicker than my T1i and I love that I can change focus points quickly in advance modes.3) Battery is a power horse.

The fps is 5 which I'm not thrilled about, but I make it work. Just have to anticipate your subject a bit.My experience with canons has been with the 40d and 30d's. I love the 60d so much more. I really like the double mode wheel and that you can control everything with one hand. Because if you have a large lense, you can support it with 1 hand and review your images with the other, you dont have to leave the lense dangling. I also like that is has all the iso, shutter speed, drive mode all on the top, so you just have to press it and flick the dial. It is probably one of the most user friendly cameras I have ever had. Also, some people may not like it, but it takes SD cards rather than CF. I had a few sd cards so no need to buy a bunch of cf cards. So yay for saving money. I have heard people complaining about the poly-carbonite body, but if you type in 'camera durability test' on youtube a guy beats up a canon xti and a nikon d3100, both with plastic bodies and both still work after the beating. And some of the bauer goalie masks are make out of poly-carbonite plastics and they dont crack when hit with pucks. So a cam made out of that material is good enough for me.The image quality is steller, even though I shoot raw at an iso of 1250 and a shutter of 500 the pixel noise isn't bad at all. Not much post processiong is needed. Also, the auto focus is super quick, or that may be just the lens. the Canon 70-200 f2.8 which I highly recomend. I also did not think I would use the rotating lcd thing, but I actually do for overhead shots.The reason I am giving it 4 stars instead of 5 is that once you go to the lcd, rather than the eyepiece is that it takes a while to focus, which is not good when trying to snag a quick overhead shot.

Like the T2i , the 60D is also light weight but it doesn't feel cheap in the hands. The ergonomics is much better with the larger grip and very well laid out buttons.  The faster shutter speed (5.3 versus 3.7 fps), articulating LCD screen, brighter view finder and faster auto-focus (faster than my friend's 5D mk2) made it really worth the $200 upgrade from the T2i.Why I chose the 60D over the 7D, other than the $400 difference in price?  The 60D and 7D uses the same CMOS sensor so the image quality should be the same.  The 7D is much heavier than the 60D, I know it has magnesium alloy but I don't plan on dropping my camera.  Being able to use SD card instead of CF card is a big factor, more cost savings since I don't have to buy additional cards for the new camera.  Having the SD card slot also allows me to use the Eye-fi X2, which, with the iPad allows for instant and better viewing of the pictures.  I can take more pictures from the same battery pack as the 7D.  The 60D also has better HD video recording capabilities.  With it's articulating LCD screen you don't have to hold the camera right in front of your face the whole time, you can hold it with your arms at 90-degree angle which is more stable if you don't have a tripod handy.  Additionally, you can set the microphone level on the 60D.  Something that is not a very obvious change was the placement of depth-of-field preview button, it is now at the bottom so you can control it with your fingers of your left hand rather than the thumb, which makes it a bit easier to use with larger zoom lenses such as the 70-200 F2.8L.  The only main downgrade from 7D is the slower shutter speed but I don't do a lot of sports photography and 5.3 fps is plenty fast for wild life. That and the 19 focus points versus only 9 on the 60D.The things I don't like about it so far are the following.  The video mode is all the way to the other side of the dial and you have to turn it 360-degrees if you're shooting in manual mode.  The live view focusing speed is so slow and it's almost useless to have the articulating LCD when shooting in weird angles.

Video mode was important for me. And yes this screen feels sturdy and well built! The screen performance/resolution itself is just amazing.- Size. I didn't like the feel of the 7d and the weight.(60d body feels sturdy and is beefy enough)- And of course the price.(This is not a comparison, I know the 7d is more of a pro camera than the 60d, these are just my reasons. If you're more interessted in the 7d anyways than I'd wait for the next model)Why I chose 60d over d7000:- Main reason was pretty much the video mode. Canon is always 2 steps ahead of nikon in this section.For all of you thinking \"d7000's 24fps @1080p will be enough\" and you're planning on using video more than average. It's not! 24p will probably die out anyways... It's more of a enthusiast's thing. I still wonder why Nikon did this, the d7000 could have been a canon killer. (At least Nikon had the brains to make video compression to h.264 this time)- Autofocus of 60d is fast,good and more than enough, period. On paper the d7000's AF system sounds great. Wow 39-Point AF System. But just look at the small print and you'll find that only 9 of these 39 are cross-type. Just like the 60d. In addition to that, in real life shooting(not on paper) the 60d's autofocus takes the lead.For those of you who don't care about video and are deciding between the 60d and d7000 then i guess the race is still on. D7000 as a still camera ONLY might have a little lead.. if you want to be picky and look for things like viewfinder coverage 100% vs. 96% of the 60d.

After taking several photography workshops in the West I wanted to upgrade my camera to one that allowed focusing through live-view (7D, 5DMII, 60D all offer this) and higher ISO sensitivity for shooting in low light.  After studying many reviews I opted to buy the 60D body since I didn't want to spend the additional $700 for the 7D body.  I enjoyed using the 60D over the 40D for the following reasons: Live View focusing (the ability to zoom in 5x and 10x to get tack sharp images), high ISO sensitivity, better and more accurate metering, the swivel screen is very useful for macro and video.  All of the ergonomics (body size, single function buttons on top, quick menu on back, new control dial) were fine.  Many reviews criticized the changes but I didn't have any problems.  I did use the camera to shoot a couple of water polo games. I thought the FPS would be fast enough when matched with 2000 ISO (pools always have terrible lighting) for higher shutter speeds.  However, the slower first shot time and the slower continuous shooting times caused me to miss almost every critical action shot I attempted.  I also disliked have to spin the mode control from TV through 8 settings to get to video setting and back when capturing short videos in between shots.  This was cumbersome and over the long term I'm afraid this will fail.  So I've sent the camera back and will contemplate whether to spend the money on the 7D.

I picked the 60D for $600 when it was on sale over the summer here on Amazon.  I felt the 60D is the best bang for your buck among crop frame cameras (better than the 7D  which is a much more expensive crop camera) if you're an amateur photographer who enjoys shooting in manual or aperture priority modes where you're setting your focus points on each shot.  There are separate dials to set your F stops and shutter speeds.  Setting the ISO is a simple button press on the top followed by moving the shutter speed dial.  Setting the focus point quickly is a little less convenient requiring a button press to activate and then moving your thumb over the rocker dial in the back, but I've gotten used to it over time.  It's got a built in flash which I hardly use, but is nice to have when you don't have an external flash with you.

This is the best deal you can get for a DSLR camera now if you want a sturdy, high quality body and don't want to pay too much.The important parameters for me in a camera, besides picture quality were professional grade shutter that can handle faster frame rates and is mechanically stronger and a pentaprism. Pentaprism is a lot more clear and illuminated and has larger magnification than pentamiror.The cheapest Nikon camera that is weather sealed and has professional grade shutter with 1/8000 sec and pentaprism is the Nikon D700 and the body alone costs more than $1200. Not to mention that a Nikon 18-200 lens costs ~$800. This means that a slightly better Nikon kit will cost more than $2000. This is not worth the difference.This camera with this lens produces amazing pictures with great detail. the RAW quality is superb. If you are shooting RAW and into doing some post processing with Canon DPP software or with Lightroom 4 (like I do), you will get amazing results with this kit. The small disadvantages of the lens (like vingeting, CA and distortion) are easily fixed with RAW with both software options I mentioned and you can improve the picture immensely. The lens is sharp except for wide open at 18mm. at 24mm it becomes very sharp and portrait shots at 40-50mm are also sharp and excellent and have a very pleasant bokeh.The camera itself and the functionality is way better than Nikon, obviously beating the cheaper D5100 and even better than the D7000 in my opinion. The Quick menu is very comfortable and the buttons and display are well placed.The only fault of this camera is in Video: First, to shoot video, you need to rotate the top dial to video mode and it is a long turn from Av/Tv modes. Second, the focusing in live view changes the lighting on the screen. I don't mind pressing half shutter or the AF button during video to focus and not having full time auto focus but the fact that it changes the lighting and records it in the video is bothersome. To avoid it I am using Manual focus in video: this also disables the focusing motor sound which is an advantage once you get used to it. Also, once getting used to it, using MF in video is quite nice and can enable some artistic shots.All together, this camera with this 18-200 lens (or even with the 18-135mm) is a great deal and a camera I will be using for many years without the need or want to replace.", "Date": "March 19, 2012"}, {"Title": "Great Camera overall!", "Author": "Aquaticbob", "ReviewID": "R180M1BPBNZVUN", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Got this camera for Christmas as an upgrade over my 20D. I gave it 4 stars because while it's overall quality is a lot better than my 20D, I feel some of the useful things on my 20D have been thrown out the window. For example, when shooting in AV mode on AEB -3,0,+3 the most time it will keep the shutter open for is 30\" on 100 ISO, regardless of the exposure. This was extremely frustrating as my 20D you could set an AEB in AV mode of -2,0,+2, and shoot on 100 ISO and it wouldn't limit the time. It would automatically calculate the time and snap the proper exposures. Now I do know how to get the same pictures using the Bulb function (B), at the time I was shooting I didn't have my remote so I couldn't do bulb shots. I have been using Bulb mode to shoot HDR pictures in low light though because if there is a way around the 30\" limit in AV mode I have yet to figure it out. Many of the other functions are great though! I let my girlfriend use the camera to take pictures of a basketball game, she didn't have much knowledge of cameras so I just put it on sport mode, and it did it's wonders! The overall quality of all the images I take is great! There is small amounts of noise on surprisingly high ISOs which is quite impressive. I use this camera a lot in low light, and I am impressed every time. The video quality is also quite well, the sound not so much. If you want to use this camera for video, make sure to have a plug in mic or other means of recording sound. I shot some quick video in very low light, and my subject turned out quite well, with good quality. In the end this camera deserved the 4 stars because of the problems I have experienced in AV mode, which was the main mode I would shoot in. I would STRONGLY recommend this camera to anyone and everyone. My friend is buying one soon after shooting with it.

Being an amateur shooter doesn't mean one must accept amateur like results within the gear's capability.  Others can do a better job of explaining technicals, menus, under-the-hood features and the virtues of metal and plastic.  My rating method is what comes out on HQ photo paper as measured by eyeballs in a durable enough package.  I'll get the rest of it figured out in good time.I shouldn't have bought it.  There are tons more rational things to do with that money, like a retirement account. Video is nice, but stills are my shtick and the ol' \"Lady XT\" has earned its keep with a decent set of Tamron lenses.  I won't earn a thin dime from a D60. It would only pay in personal satisfaction and gifts for friends in scenes demanding more than point-n-shoot.  To justify this cost, it MUST be a very meaningful improvement on the XT.Having resisted the 40, 50 and 60 to now, the approval of the household Princess and CFO came as a shock.  While DPreview is luke-warm on the 18-200 IS, this bundle fit between the very good Tamron lenses on hand.  The question of the hour is simple ... is it that much better?  One can read reviews 'til the cows come home and not really be sure it is the right thing to do.  The answer is ...I feel like a blind squirrel who has found a nut.  D60 performance is exceptionally and surprisingly better.  There is as much different between the XT and D60 as there is going from a decent point-n-shoot to the XT; quite remarkable.  I haven't had a chance to check every bell and whistle, but at a fundamental level I have noticed three things that stand out.  1. Every focused XT shot always required some DP Pro sharpening for detail. Not so with an unedited, focused D60 shot out of the camera. A full res shot barely, if at all, responds to sharpening.  Sharpening does come in to play with cropped results and, as promised, resolution stands up quite well even with deep crops.  2. The colors really seem to 'pop' on screen or photo paper.  DP Pro tone curve tends to want to drop saturation. The camera's richer color renditions are so pleasing in the few frames shot to date that I now rarely use tone curve.  In short, if a shot is in focus then one can accomplish just about any post effect a casual shooter desires.  3. While DPreview isn't thrilled, the 18-200 IS lens is producing excellent results in a very practical every day focal range. I have yet to mount one of my 'better' non-IS Tamrons; I'm almost afraid to find out if they'll stand up to the 18-200 IS, but they have been great performers on the XT.I have yet to push the limits, but I have no doubt that the D60 is going to be a pleasant surprise in all ways.  A couple of the very first shots taken are posted featuring a butterfly and bumble bee visit to our flower garden. If you have doubts, they are worth a look.

When a total amateur can get a falling drip of water in perfect focus with a beautifully blurred background (using a 50mm f/1.4 lens) with hardly any light in the kitchen right out of the box...there is something to be said for the camera.

Of course if you are considering this camera you aren't looking at it on it's own, you're comparing it to the Nikon D7000, Canon 7D, and Canon Rebel series. To me the Nikon looks great and maybe even the best of the bunch but I have never used Nikon and with all Canon lenses I personally wanted to stick with Canon. When compared to the 7D, well you're talking the difference between some AF points and a couple fps. Maybe 19 AF points would be an improvement but I've never used more than 9 AF points so I can't say for sure. I can say that 9 seems pretty sufficient even while tracking fast moving wildlife. Now with the fps, well I dunno, 3 frames per second is nice on paper but in the real world 5 fps is plenty fast. Unless you're making a living of sports photography in which case I would imagine an extra 3fps would be nice. In the highest quality RAW setting I can shoot at max fps for approximately 10-12 frames before the camera needs a (fairly long) break to save the data. Each 18MP file is about 25 MB. I imagine if you shoot in JPEG and/or reduced image size the save time would be reduced.The other consideration is the magnesium alloy body. The D7000 has about half a magnesium body, the 7D is fully magnesium reinforced, and the Rebel and 60D are all plastic. Plastics today are supremely strong; the 60D build quality feels excellent and the camera overall feels very robust. I had my Rebel XTi for 4.5yrs; I've traveled the world with that thing and used and abused it the whole time. I've never had any issues with its plastic. The 60D feels 100% better in my hands than the smaller Rebel. Regarding build quality, though, I do have one reservation when using my 70-200 f2.8: when switching between landscape and portrait orientations the weight of the lens is enough to warp the body ever so slightly. This warping causes the battery to move just a bit inside the camera, and I can feel a slight bump when the battery shifts. I don't believe it's anything to worry about and I don't know if magnesium alloy would make much difference. My solution is to support the 3 pound lens more than the body, thus switching orientations no longer stresses the body and no warping occurs. With smaller, more reasonably sized lenses this is not an issue.I bought the 60D mainly to upgrade the Rebel XTi's high ISO image quality as well as increase the megapixels. Reading the \"on paper\" specs is one thing and using the camera in the real world is another, and I am quite satisfied. What I wasn't expecting or even hoping for is the completely improved usability of the camera. By that I mean the feel, the weight, the balance, the location of the controls, and so on. The 60D feels great in my hands, the controls are much easier than the Rebel, and it's overall capabilities are expanded considerably. The 7D, at 600-700 dollars more seemed too pricey for the few extra features especially since the CMOS sensor is the same in the Rebel, 60D, and 7D thus image quality will be the same. The 60D has the articulating screen which I've used a few times already. If I was a professional photographer taking shots every single day, I would probably lean toward the 7D with the 60D as a backup. I consider myself a serious amateur and the 60D fits my needs perfectly at a great price for the camera.Apparently it shoots video too; I don't care though, if I wanted a video camera I would have bought a video camera, ha!", "Date": "July 1, 2011"}, {"Title": "awesome!", "Author": "PhilipT2i", "ReviewID": "R3IPL5TDMV9JDT", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "i got curious and got a chance to read all the 1 star reviews, i guess they have bad luck from the hundreds of the 60D being sold. i was excited to receive my camera and once i got it boom out of the box, install the battery grip and let the batteries charge.

Having been an amateur photographer for several decades, I think we have all allowed ourselves to get a bit lazy and over dependent on auto-focus, so if you're using this camera and you think the action may be fast and getting the shot critical, think about using manual over auto.Although I brought a super wide zoom (Canon 10-22 mm) and a Canon TS 24mm with me, the lens I used most was a new Tamron 28-300mm; it was light weight, compact, delivered great results and was used 80% of the time.Tamron AF 28-300mm f/3.5-6.3 XR Di LD Aspherical (IF) Macro Ultra Zoom Lens for Canon Digital SLR CamerasOne last note; for video, I found the super wide 10-22mm the lens of choice for shooting in crowds. I was also able to use it to shoot numerous videos with the camera turned on and recording, with me just holding it steady at waist level, and not looking as though I was filming at all. I used a 32GB 10X card in the camera and never even came close to capacity during the whole two weeks of shooting stills and videos (although I did have a spare 16GB in case.)Net, I am very pleased with the camera, and anxiously waiting for Canon to release a new model with the flip out finder + a great autofocus.", "Date": "April 17, 2011"}, {"Title": "I'm very pleased", "Author": "4America \"4america\"", "ReviewID": "R1VAGEKGN0I0ZD", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Like many people I spent nearly three months trying to determine which camera to purchase. I looked at the Nikon D90 and D7000; as well as, the Canon T2i. In the end I felt the best value was the Canon 60D. I could go on and on about the camera but most importantly I can say I'm very happy with my decision. This camera is stacked with features and takes fantastic pictures. I honestly don't think you can go wrong with any of the cameras but for me it came down to pixels, pentaprism, autofocus, LCD, and price. I have always been a Canon guy (A1, two Rebels) but this was my first digital and I was open to either company. In the end my view was that Canon is a better value at the lower end and Nikon is a better product at the high end.In terms of my decision to go with the 60D over the T2i I just felt that the extra features were going to get me better pictures and ultimately make me happier in the long term. These cameras are big so while the Rebel is smaller it is still a substantial camera with the lens on it. You have to be committed to carrying around a camera of this size. From a price perspective, the 60D was an additional $200. That gets you a better view finder and better focusing. These two things can make a huge difference between getting the best possible picture.Having used a high end film camera since I was 15 I find the controls to be very intuitive. There is a lot there so it will still take me some time to learn all the features but I'm able to get off and running very quickly. When you look at the reviews most of the issues are overstated. The majority of pictures with this camera will be taken in one of the standard shooting modes. The rest of the settings are nice to have but are hard to fiddle with when you are just concentrating on getting pictures taken of a brithday or a sporting event. There's one rule that seems to stand the test of time - the 80-20 rule. 80% of the people will use 20% of the functionality of this camera. The other 20% may use 80% but it will be less than 20% of the time.Lastly, I wouldn't get too caught up with the lenses either. This is a good all around lens if you can have only one lens. Again, 80% of the people will rarely change a lens. There are better lenses but most of us just won't notice the difference. I do believe that image stabilization is a must. In my mind it is the single biggest benefit to the average user. Sure some lenses focus faster or are better in low light but most of us can just hold down the shutter and use a flash.Get the camera and have some fun. There will be plenty of time to upgrade lenses, flashes, etc. You'll never be able to get back the pictures you miss.", "Date": "March 31, 2011"}, {"Title": "Perfect mid-level camera", "Author": "Mike_311", "ReviewID": "R2FTYSK6H0TYGY", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I moved up from a Rebel XS to purchase the 60D. I'm not a pro, just a hobbyist, so i couldn't justify a huge expense.This camera is amazing. I'm not going to to dazzle you with specs that most of you don't even care about.What i love most- The articulating screen is a must. Some people are going to tell you its just waiting to get broken, but if you are that hard on your camera than you shouldn't be looking at more solid bodies anyway. The live view is great, the autofocus is fairly quick, not quick enough to get young kids, but it will allow you to go around a party and composed shots. you will get much better pictures since your subjects wont be so shy. I also like the fact that it will give me a real time view to what my setting will do to the picture, for instance if i adjust my shutter speed or aperture the live view will dim or get brighter so that i have a good idea what the shot will look like, so I'm not wasting my time chimping. I can just compose, shoot and move on.The ISO range is a definitely plus over my old XS that only went to 1600 and was very noisy. i can shoot at 3200 or 6400 and remove the extra noise easily if i need to in post processing. this combined with a 50mm 1.8 give great shots that aren't blown out with a flash. Perfect for indoor candids.The weight - This camera has more size and weight than the XS did, although it feels way better in my hand. After holding this and picking up the XS, the XS feels cheap. While the XS was great because it was so light, this doesn't weigh too much more. Now put on the kit 18-135 and you feel feel its girth but its a solid lens with metal threads. I put my 50mm f1.8 and is feels not too much heavier than the XS but way more comfortable.HD video - from my initial sampling , its very easy to use and looks great, especially since you get to use good glass.Burst rate - great for kids, this thing will rip off 5 pics per second in RAW! It will lock up the camera for a few seconds while it transfer all that data to the card, not that i used my old SD card and haven't tried it with a faster card.The 18-135 f/3.5-5.6 IS lens - The XS kit was 18-55 and i had the 55-250mm. I hated switching lenses. One of my reason for upgrading was to get this lens. Now i can walk around an shoot, no lens switching. Yeah i don't have the reach anymore, but this camera has a bigger image sensor and i can go to 135mm and crop and get similar quality to the XS at 250mm. plus its way more solid than the XS kit lens. it has metal threads and has way better build quality.I'm not even scratching the surface to what this camera can do. if you are looking at an upgrade, this camera doesn't cost too much more than the t2i or t3i (when it comes out) and definitely worth a look to you. if you need a probody and specs, look elsewhere, but if the Rebels seem to be lacking, this is the camera for you.", "Date": "February 28, 2011"}, {"Title": "I'm lovin' my Canon", "Author": "Mel", "ReviewID": "R2Z7PRFPT5G15I", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I upgraded from a Nikon D40 and I must say that this was a great switch!

If you are contemplating the same move, i will tell you it's definitely worth it for the improved ISO performance alone. I took a few indoor shots without a flash at ISO 800. Compared to my XSi, the 60D blew it away. I am also very happy with the higher burst rate. Definitely worth having with kids in the house.Video: using the kit lens (18-135mm) I'd suggest only filming in a well lit area until you get a better lens. I needed to set my ISO over 2,000 to achieve visibility on the screen. I took my Panasonic SD60 camcorder and had no problem shooting good video with low/no grain in the same room/lighting. However, shooting video in a well lit room produced great results but at times it was difficult to tell if i had the subject in focus on the swivel screen.Some of the ergonomics that people have issues with are true but not enough to deter me from buying this camera. The reviewer below me(by date) named them all:1) on/off switch: very small tab to flip over.2) That left dial: wish it would rotate continuously instead of having a stop point. I don't switch modes too often so it's not a huge issue but if you do like to switch modes, i can see it as a future frustration.3) When having the screen flipped out, you realize the delete photo/video button is in a bad position. The fix: don't have the screen flipped out or delete the photos at a later time. I prefer to delete the bad photos/videos immediately after shooting so it's an irritant.Overall, I would recommend this camera as an upgrade over the older Rebel series and as a first time user of DSLR's. OTOH, it would be difficult to recommend this over the T3i unless you need the higher burst speedI will report back in a few months after some more extensive usage.

I am moving up from an XSi, and the 60D is clearly a great improvement in many ways (higher ISO performance, better resolution and other features). Its slightly larger size makes for better handling ergonomics---than with a Rebel--with my bigger, longer lenses. I am not hung up on the metal vs hard plastic issue--the camera is solid enough but not excessively heavy. This is a terrific camera. I am very happy with my purchase. I can see that this camera helps maximize the potential of all my Canon lenses, beyond what the Rebels were able to do--thats the bottom line. The difference in my photos is obvious.  I am not a video enthusiast and did not get this camera for that purpose; live view works for me with landscape and macro shots-- I like it. If I had not invested so much money in Canon's very good lenses, I might have been persuaded to get the Nikon 7000. But the great Nikon lenses are even more expensive than most Canon L lenses and the quality is the same. What keeps me tied to Canon are their excellent lenses and the inventory of their lenses that I have. I may get a Canon full frame camera some day if I decide to take this hobby much more seriously.If you can't afford a 7D and want a more substantial camera than the rebel line, this camera is solid performer.

That type of thought continued with me through the time I saw one on the shelf at my local Best Buy store, they had one on display so I asked if I would be able to try it out and use it, so they took it off their shelf and let me use it. Upon looking at it at the store I noticed one thing right off the back. The dial on the top of the camera that switches between full manual, portrait, auto picture and to video mode didn't move. Thinking it was just a factory lock for the Best Buy display I gave it back to the person at the store who let me use it and walked off, in all honesty a little disappointed at the 60D. But that all changed when I had the opportunity to use the Canon 60D out on the field. When I was using the 60D I realized that the reason why the dial wouldn't move between picture / video modes was because Canon had added a locking feature on it that prohibits you from changing it unless you unlock it. It unlocks with the simple push of a button that resides right in the middle of the dial. You push and hold the button to be able to easily switch modes. When using it on the field I also found that I didn't bump it between video and night portrait mode by accident because of the locking feature. I was really happy to have that convience on the camera. Another thing that I noticed with the 60D was it has all the ISO settings that the slightly older 7D has but at a smaller price tag as well, but still a bit more then the older T2i. The Canon T2i has a ton to offer by being below the $1,000 mark but the 60D, being only a few hundred dollars more gives it a lot more winning features that neither the 7D nor the T2i have to offer. One of those features is the ability to freely move the LCD Monitor. Canon has given you the ability to move the LCD monitor out making it a whole lot easier to actually view what you're shooting way up high or way down low, so you no longer have to be in those real awkward positions to get your shot. You also have the ability to close the LCD monitor putting the screen toward the camera so you don't scratch it between shots, and when the camera is in the bag. I do wish, however, that when you do close LCD Monitor you had the ability to view what your shooting through the viewfinder on top of the camera. unfortuniatly you still do not have that ability with this camera just as you don't have that ability with the other Canon DSLR Cameras when shooting video. I did like the ability to view your cameras settings on top of the camera, like you do with the 7D so you don't have to have it displayed on the LCD screen if you don't want to. When using the 7D or the T2i for video you notice at the top and bottom of the LCD monitor those not quite black bars giving you the unsettling feeling while shooting if what is darkened out is also being recorded. The 60D removes not quite dark bars completely giving you two full black bars on the top and bottom of the LCD monitor allowing you to now focus completely on what you are recording. I do wish that Canon would remove those bars all together to give you full access to the LCD Monitor, but the black bars are better then the half black bars that used to be there. One thing that I really hated about the 60D was that Canon has changed where all the controls (what is on the back of the camera by the LCD monitor) on the camera are, so using the 60D you may have to sit down before you hear or say \"Action\" and make sure you know where all the buttons are. Another thing is although the camera may 60D on it, but it doesn't really look like all the other cameras in the \"D\" series line. It looks like a mix between the \"Rebel\" and the \"D\" series cameras but that aside it still looks great. One thing that Canon has failed, once again, to put on the 60D is no XLR input, and no audio meters, thus making you have to guess, hope, and pray that your audio is being recorded to the camera and that it's being recorded nicely.All in all the 60D is a powerhouse of a camera packing quite a punch with it and another landmark in the world of both Professional photography and Professional Videography. For me personally, having used all three in the field multiple times there are just those winning features that I've mentioned along with other small adjustments that make this camera win over the 7D and the T2i.

Are these cameras really being sold as new?Seeing that this was a replacement for my T3 (retro-grade?), I immediately went to work pixel-peeping and comparing shots. While I was not able to find any obvious variance in picture quality between the 2 cameras, I did find that pictures taken with the 60D at ISO 1600 had noticeably more noise than those taken with my T3 (using the same lens, same camera settings (on-board NR and ALO disabled), same lighting and test subject, all RAW shots taken on a tripod. Not convinced, I took 2 more test shots with different subjects and different lighting. Same results. The shots taken with the T3 were noticeably less noisy at ISO 1600. While this may not be a huge deal, considering how we have all been lectured at some point about the evils of shooting at that high an ISO, it's certainly worth noting.The truth of the matter is that for $700 less than the cost of a 60D, you can get the same, if not slightly better images (at ISO 1600) from a T3.There is no debating, however, that the 60D is a well-built camera. The shutter sound alone leaves no doubt as to its intended durability. The image quality is great...in fact, it's just as great as the less pricey, albeit plasticy T3!If you're considering a 60D, and build quality, burst rate, top panel LCD, and dedicated controls are selling points for you, then definitely buy one (like I did).

I forgot to mention that this camera also shoots Video!!!  Yes, I have always wanted a means to shoot video when photographing birds and well, I have never had a video camera with me when I needed one.  Well, now I do! In the past, when out shooting (photographing) birds I have had an instance of rarity that I could not keep up with shooting still pictures. \"You are photographing song birds and notice that a coopers hawk lands in a tree nearby\".  Yeah, you can use rapid fire to hopefully capture the \"bird of prey getting it's prey\" but odds are, you will miss it all...  With video capabilities, you go from stills to video in a second and capture the entire footage._____________________________________________This model replaces a Canon Rebel Xsi, purchased in 2008, that also replaced a Canon Rebel XT purchased in 2005.Up until 2005, I had owned numerous digital cameras, but none of them had the diversity that a film camera possessed. So, I decided to make the move to a DSLR, and have had no regrets what so ever. Yeah, the price is higher, but what you save on film erases the cost difference in just one year if you take pictures like I do.I use mine for a variety of photos, but mainly, I love to photograph wildlife!  Invest in a 200 mm or even better a 400 mm lens and you can get very up close and personal with even the most skittish hummingbird.  For wildlife, you also need to invest, but it's not a must if you use a tripod, in an \"IS\" piece of glass.  The \"IS\" stands for \"image Stabilizer\".  It compensates for your hand shake.  Trust me, it's worth the investment.With the past models, I have found that using the \"manual\" settings worked best with me for the best shots.  With the 60D, so far, the \"auto\" setting gets me really breath-taking photos!  I can't wait to see what I can do with the manual settings, but as with any new camera, the learning curve is steep.I also love taking photos of pets and so far, I am not disappointed at all shooting pictures inside.The MP increase from the Xsi is almost 50 percent, and it shows!All of my old lenses work on this model and also, my memory cards do too....  The battery is another beast.  Seems that Canon has an evil plot to keep changing the battery design so that you can not use a battery from an older model in a newer model.  So, if you plan on keeping up with the Jones, then don't buy a lot of extra batteries as if/when you upgrade cameras, you will not be able to carry them with you.Other than that, this is a great camera and for a really good price here on Amazon compared to every other place I have shopped.", "Date": "December 5, 2013"}, {"Title": "Compact DSLR with great IQ, able AF & durable build", "Author": "P.K.

It's been 100% reliable, durable and produced great images. Unlike a couple recent posters, no problems with the grip rubber, and I have sweaty mitts!I'm mainly a RAW shooter, but found default JPEG rendering excellent, a level better than my prior 50D and slightly better than my 7D. EOS 60D and 7D RAW are basically the same. I use a two-camera setup--60D and 7D--to shoot video of classical music ensembles. The fold out LCD makes low and high angle shooting easier than the 7D. However, HD video quality is exactly the same as the 7D. That is, they're both excellent. Where the 60D falls down a bit is operating ease. The video setting is the last icon on the mode dial, making it a PITA to quickly go from stills to video, especially since you have to depress a lock release while rotating the dial. The 7D has a dedicated thumb switch to enable video mode and is a a lot faster and easier to switch back and forth.The 7D has a joystick controller and I miss having one on the 60D. Instead, the 60D uses a tiny rocker switch centered within the Quick Control Dial (QCD). Not as effective as the joystick and my fingers are too large for accurate selection of AF points and other options.No problems with dust on the sensor. My past DSLRs needed regular CMOS cleaning, so the 60D's auto dust shaker helps a lot. Still, I avoid changing lenses at the beach or in dusty environments.Finally, the AF system is basically the same all cross point array used in the 40D/50D. Not cutting edge like the 7D or 5D MKIII but able, quick and reliable in most situations. It rarely missed focus even in poor light and the outer points are accurate enough for head and shoulder portraits (lock AF on an eye). Contrast focus is available in Live View but is painfully slow so I normally use manual focus for video.I like the 60D a lot. It's not perfect but the able AF and excellent IQ make it a near equal of the 7D but housed in a  petite and lightweight body. And for travel and kicking around town I can't think of a much better camera for under $600. Of course, if you need the latest and greatest, the 70D has the features and form factor of the 60D plus improved AF and CMOS, albeit at nearly twice the price.", "Date": "November 27, 2013"}, {"Title": "Absolutely Great camera", "Author": "Bryan", "ReviewID": "R28F8U65AE63VE", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "It works great.

Sure, it's three years old already but there's a bigger appreciation beating the crap out of my first DSLR and finally upgrading the body.Noise?  Everyone is talking about how noisy the 60D and 7D can be it's nothing compared to the 20D or older models.  I was astounded how clean it looked at ISO 800 and 1600 with very minimal grain.  Sure, there will be noise at high ISO but from 20D's mere 'okay' images at ISO 800 and horrible grain at ISO 1600, I can shoot up to ISO 3200 and still suppress majority of the noise during post processing.  I know it won't be like the 5D MKII/MKIII or the 6D.  But for the price, what a huge leap.  Our family took a trip to Boston Children's Museum days ago and I was able to shoot at average ISO 3200 indoors and performed very well.  If low ISO is desired that's where the Speedlite will come in handy.60D is 0.2fps slower than the 20D but it seems to focus more accurately, the shutter is quieter and I've been leaving it in a high shutter speed mode to capture multiple shots for any given scene.  There are basically more usable images is all I can say.It opened up quite a bit of possibility with this body alone; astrophotography is something I want to try (just purchased Manfrotto 294 aluminum tripod) without worrying about excess noise.  I also don't worry about needing my Speedlite for most shots and of course if I ever want to shoot video with it the function is there.Let's not forget battery life.  I set the output to smallest RAW which I took about 300 photos at the museum.  I didn't even put a dent in the battery.  Normally with 20D it'll easily eat up a third of battery life.  While I didn't use the Live View function often (drains the battery faster) for a day's trip worth it was nice not having to worry about carrying a spare battery.  When I put the battery in the charger at home after 400 photos the charger light was still blinking at the 3-pulse 75% full!One thing I noticed coming from 1.8\" screen to this giant 3.0\" screen is that I can clearly see the picture detail and appreciate the photos at the same time.  Photography is becoming fun again.  This is what I needed after all these years.7/16/2013 Update with some astrophotography:Though I'm new to astrophotography, I've stacked some images shooting at ISO 1600, less than 25 sec shutter (the Rule of 600) along with my Tamron wide angle shot wide open (f2.8) and wow...what a difference.  Because of 60D's articulating screen, I can magnify to the brightest star using the x10 zoom function, set the lens on manual and focus (it doesn't focus at infinity but about one notch below).  Now I know there's 60Da specific for astrophotography (like the 20Da) but there's so much you can capture with this camera.  Luckily I live in a rural area and 30 minute drive away from most towns give me plenty of dark sky with stars so venturing out again once the new moon is out next month.Now off to shoot some sunrise this week :)", "Date": "July 13, 2013"}, {"Title": "Geat quality!", "Author": "Thomas N.

I really like the quick access button to see real time changes that can be made to the image before taking the shot or video recording. The feel of the camera seems to be much more comfortable and professional than the Xsi. I did a lot of research before ordering the 60D on my decision to upgrade and found that by selling my Xsi on eBay and purchasing the 60D on Amazon it costs me about $300 to make the swap for the bodies only. I had several Canon lenses already that were perfect in the transition to the 60D. I also wanted a SLR camera that could do video which the Xsi would not do. That alone makes it much more logical to make the move to the 60D. I can hardly wait until I can find some worthwhile subject matter to record with the video so purchased a high speed SD card in anticipation of the need for both speed and storage.

I love the tilting LCD screen when I have to go for a creative shot. Captured some videos with a low resolution using a 50mm 1.8 lens which were really nice even at 640x480.

I used this for a fashion show (to be unnoticeable vs bringing my 7D with a battery grip) and shoot RAW that night. I missed some shots because the camera is busy processing after 4-5 consecutive shots.

I've taken around 600 shots or more with it thus far with several lenses. I've used the 18-55mm, 55-250mm, 50mm 1.8, and 85mm 1.8. I immediately tossed the kits and left myself with primes to use. I won't go into the specs of this camera, it has clearly been covered many times. I will state my own personal pros and cons...Pros- Handling. As a newbie to DSLRs, I absolutely love the button layout of this camera. Things just make sense and are easy to find. I have no trouble quickly changing shutter speed or aperture. It is the perfect size for my hands (which aren't small) and has just enough weight to feel comfortable and not fragile.- Focuses well. Although there are only nine focus points, if you can get the focus where you want it then it does very well focusing with no shutter lag.- The files aren't terribly huge even shooting RAW.- Great pictures, especially if you are using a prime.- The flip out screen. This screen is both a pro and a con. If you're shooting video, it will be excellent. As a photographer, it is nice to be able to protect the glass more by facing it inward. In all honesty, though, I would probably prefer a screen that doesn't rotate.- The lock on the mode dial. Though I don't think I actually would accidentally change the modes, it serves as an extra measure of security for the camera.Cons- Not good past I would say 800 ISO. Noise in images annoy me, especially if I'm not even pixel peeping. This camera cannot handle high ISO well at all. I actually called Canon to see why I was getting noisy images at 800 to which they replied that the camera should be fine to 1600 and that I needed to turn noise reduction on. I shoot RAW, but I did this thinking it would help. The change was minimal to none, I still get noise in my images and sometimes it can be visible at only 400 ISO. Grr.- Auto-focus points. There are only nine of them and they aren't too spread out so it limits my composition a bit. Like I said above, when you can get the point where you need it, it's great. Otherwise it is frustrating.Overall, this is a good camera. However, I will probably end up switching to either the Nikon D7000 or D7100 for the better low light performance and more auto-focusing points. It makes me sad to change, as this camera is very simple to understand and use.

I then started looking at the 7D and watched numerous reviews comparing the two. I again realized it only comes down to a few features.It basically came down to this: the 7D had the features I wanted but was out of my price range. The T3i was a nice upgrade, but I feared owning it a year and feeling like I was ready to upgrade again. The 60D was exactly what I wanted: a huge upgrade from my Rebel XS without breaking the bank.

About six months ago, I decided that I've explored the Canon system enough to my satisfaction, and that I would now distill down to at most two bodies and 5-6 lenses. I sold off everything, including the 5D MKII and now have a very old XTi that I don't care about banging up, and this 60D for when I want to make more of an effort.Plenty of other people have posted their impressions of the 60D, including some very technical reviews. I will just say that after giving this hobby a serious go in terms of time and money, after doing 3 years of paid gigs on the side of product photography, this the 60D takes better pictures than my abilities. The XTi also probably takes better photos than my abilities. It's a great body, easy to use, good quality, and dependable.

I am happy I did.Firstly, I bought canon as I have owned other canon products and have been happy with them.  My brother has a Canon 7D, which also influence my decision on brand.  After reading extensively on all the types of Canon DSLR's I decided on this one.  It was a toss up between this and some of the high end digital rebels.  I'll let you find online reviews for figure out the difference between the cameras.Great solid construction.  Kit lens 18-135mm f/3.5-5.6 IS UD.  Glad I didn't go with the 18-55.  I've really enjoyed having the extra zoom.  If I had it to do over again I might even give consideration to the kit with an 18-200mm lens.  I bought a 50mm f1.4 prime lens separately.  I knew I would want it for some low light and portiat photography I've been wanting to do.Anyway.  I've really enjoyed the camera.  Been doing some timelapse/long exposure/star trails/trick photography after reading the many online tutorials and it has been a blast.I wish there was a built in intervalometer.  Hopefully canon is working on this and I bet in a year or two it will be standard in even mid-range DSLR's.  Didn't really know this would be a function I would use as I didn't know I was going to be enjoying timelapse photography.  If timelapse really interests you that might be something you would want in a camera.  However, I found a really good/cheap intervalometer on an un-named auction site and I have no limitations in that department.  I guess there is a software intervalometer on the canon disc that comes with the camera; if you want to do that you just have to tether it to your laptop/desktop.", "Date": "January 11, 2012"}, {"Title": "Mature and reliable DSLR camera", "Author": "Domagoj", "ReviewID": "RXGAFDEEOVKJC", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "As former owner of 450D camera, I have to say that 60D has corrected many of that camera's annoyances, including much better evaluative metering outside in the sun or in more tricky situations (60d though in rare circumstances tends to underexpose indoors, when flash is not used, but there are another metering modes that easily correct this - you can change them fast on top of the camera). Further, jpegs are much better, they are sharp out of the camera, AF is (opposite to my sample of 450D) very accurate, colors are more realistic to those in real life, they are not dull (you can see much difference between various jpeg modes - landscape and neutral for example). 18MP gives very high resolution and detail, same as 1DX pro camera from Canon, for example. Video is also of high quality, handling is excellent, much better than old 450D. High ISO pictures are much cleaner than past xxD (or xxD cameras up to 500d) and you can go up to 3200 ISO for jpeg or to 6400 ISO when post-processing RAW images. There are some new features that are very convenient and useful, like wireless flash control built-in (even cheapest cameras from Canon nowadays have this feature, unlike in the past) or tilt & swivel lcd monitor. Now, you can buy good and powerful Canon-compatible wireless TTL flash (chinese made) for only 150$ and you can immediately start with wireless TTL flash photography with this camera - for this price this was unthinkable years ago. So you have to have that in mind when you think about buying older xxD model instead of this one (you lose great video capability, too). My only complaint about this camera is that LCD is not very color-accurate, i.e. tends to oversaturate reds, but this is perceivable only is specific indoor situations. On color-accurate desktop LCD everything is fine. You can always shoot RAW and post-process easily those pictures, ofcourse. That is an old Achilles' heel of cameras, but new pro cameras (like new Nikon D4 or probably 1dX too) are going to fix that and provide accurate colors and greater color range on camera's lcds, too. Also, I'm still waiting for one-click 100% zoom into the picture in Canon cameras. This can really save some time when reviewing picture's AF point sharpness on camera. Although dynamic range is good enough for most situations, i expect Canon to catch up to Sony here and provide even better sensors in future, so images' post-processing would require less time.In short, this camera is excellent and mature semi-pro DSLR camera. In times when you can have much more compact camera than this one, with virtually same image quality (Sony NEX series)you have to offer something on top of that. Excellent handling, optical quality of accompanying lenses, wide choice of excellent Canons' or third-party flashes, battery grips.. are very important for profesionals or semipros. But for majority of people (and even for pros as second or vacation camera), future (i would even say nowadays actuality) are interchangeable lens compacts. They are much cheaper to have too, especially when you count in much cheaper (although weaker) lenses.", "Date": "January 11, 2012"}, {"Title": "Love Love", "Author": "Nessa", "ReviewID": "R24OU4CX9M87UM", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I am glad my husband went with the upgrade from the Rebels to this camera.

It finally gave up the ghost and I debated the 7 and 60Ds.  The few additional features and magnesium body of the 7D just didn't sell me on the extra $700.  Without cracking the manual, I began shooting.  Ok, the 18-135mm IS lens isn't L series quality but it is very good for a \"toss in\" starter lens.  I also have the 28-200 USM and the 100--400 L IS USM.  All three lenses are delivering photos my 10D could only dream of.The auto-focus is very quick on all 3 lenses and auto-focus assist comes on when it should.  While I use an external flash (Speedlight 420EX) for most situations the pop-up works great!  the 10D never got red-eye reduction right... With the 60D I've taken pics of blue-eyed kids and pets (notorious for red or glow eyes) in near dark conditions with nary a bit of red eye.The one accessory I consider mandatory is the BG-E9 battery grip.  Since Canon switched to an ABS body for the 60D (the ONLY negative I have) the grip adds a more substantial feel to the camera.  It also holds 2 batteries so you can shoot your memory card dry.  Having a grip on my 10D, and grip/winders on my 35mm SLRs I could never get used to a camera without one.  The upside of the camera body being ABS is that even with the grip, the whole rig is lighter than my 10D... a definite + when lugging it for 8 hours of airshow photography or a wedding.  The added battery life without swapping batteries in such situations is very convenient.I really haven't shot more than a few minutes of video but it was crystal clear.

After comparing the specs I couldn't justify the higher price for the 7D. Granted it has some great features -- higher burst rate, advanced AF system, focus microadjust -- but I decided I could live without those. I'm a hobbyist photographer with limited disposable income and so have to concentrate on getting the most bang for my buck.After shooting with the 60D I'm really happy with the results I'm getting with it. From an upgrader's perspective, here's what I gained over the Rebel:Better ergonomics. The 60D body is larger than the Rebel and feels better in my hands. Adding the Canon battery grip (I also had a battery grip on my Rebel) makes it feel even better.Autofocus is much improved over the Rebel, especially in low light.The viewfinder is bigger and brighter than the Rebel's.HIgh ISO performance is very good. I find that if I properly expose or slightly overexpose, I can get good results at 3200 and acceptable results at 6400. Noise is easily cleaned up in Lightroom. Pushing underexposed high ISO shots in post, unsurprisingly, yields really noisy images.The control and menu layout took some getting used to but I now like the Q screen and can adjust settings really quickly.The top LCD screen is handy for a quick look at camera settings.Burst rate is fast enough for me. I shoot RAW exclusively and so the buffer fills up quickly but I've yet to miss a shot because of this.The wireless flash triggering works great with my 580EX II and 430EX Speedlites and is a big improvement over fiddling with an E-TTL cord and a pair of Cactus V5 triggers for strobist-style shooting with the 2 flashes off-camera.The flip screen is more useful than I'd anticipated, particularly when shooting from a tripod in live view mode.I'd feared buyer's remorse after choosing the 60D over the 7D but that hasn't come to pass.

I am only beginning to explore the potential of this camera, however, in my case coupled the the Canon EF-S 15-85MM lens, I am already producing pictures with amazing results.  First, the low light sensitivity of this camera is impressive.  In dark settings with minimal light the camera produces images with stunning clarity and color, more so than can be observed with the naked eye.  Second, the adjustable view finder is very handy when taking pictures at odd angles. Third, the video capabilities are also first rate with HD capture and excellent quality. The combination with the EF-S 15-85MM lens is an excellent starting point for a more advanced journey into digital photography.  Just make sure to buy a larger capacity SD card with class 6 or greater speed, this camera will capture and deliver megabytes at an astounding rate, especially in video mode.  A 4GB card will fill in 12 minutes at maximum quality settings.

I like the way the LCD screen pivots so you can angle it to see what you are shooting in live mode.My lenses work with this camera with no problem.

I was looking for a dslr in the $1000-1500 range, with an equal emphasis on still and video photography. After extensive research, I narrowed the choices to the new Canon T3i, the 60D, and the Nikon D7000. Since I plan on using the hd movie mode extensively, the articulating lcd screen (you don't know how great this option is until you actually use it!) was a huge selling point.  That effectively elimated the Nikon from consideration. Comparing the T3i and the 60D was easy...the 60D is hands down the better camera.  It has a better build, better AF system, faster burst rate, higher shutter speed, etc. And it's only $200 more than the T3i! I wound up buying the 60D with the 18-200mm Canon EF IS lens kit, for a grand total of $1399. The lens alone has an average street price of about $600, so the kit was an excellent value.Is this the perfect camera? No, but what camera is? There's always some feature you see on another camera that you wish was on yours. For example, I would love to have the dual SD card slots found on the D7000. But when deciding on the camera that best meets your needs, you have to weigh the pros and cons.  At least for myself, the 60D has far more pros than cons. It's a terrific camera, and an exceptional value at it's current price point. If you're looking for a mid level dslr, you would be remiss not to give this camera more than a passing glance.", "Date": "April 14, 2011"}, {"Title": "Auto ISO and swivel screen best features for me", "Author": "Popcorn 77", "ReviewID": "R2OU51QHJJEA1V", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "My last EOS camera was a 20D and have upgraded to the 60D. I have been looking at the 7D and 60D features and reviewed performances from DPREVIEW.com and also from the-digital-picture.com These 2 sites have detailed review notes and explains their process for doing their tests.The feature I liked most were the auto ISO and swivel screen. I  am aware that using the swivel screen (invoked by live view mode button) to focus is slow, but since i do not do sports shooting that much nor do I take pictures as a profession, I will use the live view mode when I want to see the image on a 3 inch screen rather than on the eye view finder. I am very happy with it, it allows me to shoot at body level.The next feature that I never had on my 20D is the auto IS0, I noticed on my indoor shots the ISO will be at 3200, even when I am at Aperture priority set at 2.8.  The picture quality is not that grainy. I noticed that with  the blu ray movies i have seen that the low light scenes are also grainy but it captures the mood of the available light. I like this feature because I will get the right exposure always without manually setting the ISO.I bought the 60D over the 7D because I was trying to use the savings to buy a better flash and a vertical grip and also a remote switch. I also forego the compact flash I already own in favor of the SDXC format since I only have 3 CF memory cards.Of course the 7D is more money because it is more durably built and has more features that I may not need on most occasions. Example would be the more added weather sealing, more cross points focusing, alloy body,  AF lense adjustment. For me this is minor, and same is tru for the mouse that I have grown familiar with.  I am not bothered with using the new mouse.With the 60D, I have the features I want and allow me to buy the vertical grip and upgraded flash and remote switch with the savings from not getting the 7D.

I take really good care of all my camera stuff - all my lenses etc live in their own little bags, but this, combined with the fact that my general-purpose EFS 17-85mm lens has required repairs twice in 3 years, makes me think that there is still something lacking in build quality.FWIW - I have several friends who only use Nikon, who have had similar trouble with more expensive models of that brand, so I don't think you'll get much better going elsewhere.

After years of salivating over DSLRs, and reading dozens of reviews, and trying to understand the technical specs, I chose the 60D for several reasons.1) Price.  It is affordable, and becoming more so.  As I write this review, it's dropped ~$70 since I bought it a couple weeks ago.  I'm still happy with my purchase.  Not only is the 60D a good value, but the EF lenses that cropped-sensor DSLRs use are also generally more affordable than their full-frame counterparts.2) Durability.  The \"build quality\" of the 60D is what separates it from the T3i and other Rebel models, for me.  This was truly the selling point.  There is less plastic and more metal on this camera.  Deathklok would be proud.  I know that I'm going to take this on cross-country flights, road trips, hiking trips, beach adventures, and more.  It's not bullet proof, but a little extra resistance to moisture and the elements is worth it for how I'm going to use it.3) Versatility.  I'm going to use this camera to make YouTube videos to share my progress in my sport, and to promote my gym.  The fact that it's a high quality camera means I can also use it for snapshots of friends, marketing photos for the website, action shots of events at the gym, head shots of my employees, etc.  Using different lenses I can get into all kinds of fun stuff: wildlife photography, macro photography, perhaps even astrophotography (though the 60Da is better for that).  I can add microphones, separate flashes, mount it on a Glidecam, or a tripod, etc.  It is upgradeable and useful in a variety of situations.4) It's an \"industry standard.\"  After talking to a lot of people who make awesome parkour and tricking videos, Canon DSLRs in general are the cameras of choice.  If you're looking for a camera for wedding photography, vacation photos, or whatever else, ask people who do that what camera they like.  Fifty million Elvis fans can't be wrong.  If they're all using Nikons, and have good reasons why, then get a Nikon, or a Pentax, or whatever.Okay, that said, I have only been using it for a few weeks.  It is definitely going to take me awhile to learn how to use this camera to it's fullest.  I have however taken a few pictures and videos already that I am very happy with.  The resolution is clear, the autofocus in photo mode is great, and the controls are easy to use once I have learned them.

Anyways here is my review.ITEM:I purchase this camera a month and two weeks ago. I burned about 1,265$ for this DSLR camera. I THINK IT'S WONDERFUL (no sarcasm intended)!! I was so excited after un-boxing this package. The DSLR comes in with an audio function, which I can adjust the audio if it's too loud, and increase or decrease the sensitivity of the audio. I think the Canon 60D is the only DSLR camera (that I know of) with audio function adjustment. Hence this is why it's great for filming. It's good for photography, and enthusiast young filmmakers (like me). It's a little pricey, but hey, I voluntarily purchase this camera at my own free will, which I received this benefit in return. Both sellers and buyers (Canon Company, and I) earned wealth. In other words, we're both happy of this trade. I give this DSLR camera a 5 star overall.LENS: 5 stars on the 18-135mm lens. The lens came with the package because I did not ordered the DSLR body camera by itself. It wouldn't be great without a standard lens. It's great for beginners, and pretty big at first sight.Battery Performance:The battery performance last pretty long. Of course, when the battery arrives in the package it always needs a full charge. Don't expect it's going to be fully charge for you (just like any other kind of new a cell phone. Suppliers/Sellers don't have the time to charge your battery if they are selling their product). I would forget to turn off the camera for a few days and the battery still last really long (It's at a full battery power) probably because it can conserve in standby mode.Construction Quality & Controls: 5 stars for the construction and controls, not too difficult at all. The camera fits perfectly right in your hands as you firmly grip it. Comparing to my brother's DSLR Canon 600D(T3i), the 600D is slightly smaller than this 60D. The construction is bigger, almost as big as the Canon 7D from looking at the online reviews. What is different are the controls, buttons, and settings. It is different from any other kind of Canon DSLR cameras(It doesn't surprise me). It's pretty straight forward, if you don't understand or think the buttons and controls are overwhelming. Then read the manual that is what it's there for.Image Quality: I am not going to give the image quality a rating because taking photos and collecting footage are all base on YOU. You need to alter and adjust the settings. You can't just give the quality ratings by default. It's how you can change the image quality through the settings. You can color correct it through this Canon 60D, saturation, increase or decrease the ISO levels, landscape, portrait, in doors, out doors, etc. and other color correcting settings. I can't give my opinions on this. I would if I were to compare this to a different DSLR camera like Sony, Nikon, and etc. Other than that all the images are sharp when you focus with your lens (FYI, there are plenty of lens you can buy), or you can adjust the colors and sharpness through the settings.Other thoughts,I was going to purchase this DSLR camera on Newegg.com, however, when I was browsing online it was out-of-stock for two whole weeks. I had to buy one somewhere besides going to Best-buys or Fry's N Electronics. Luckily, Amazon only had 8 in-stocks left when I checked before I purchased one. This was the quickest option I did before it gets out of stock. When the package came in the box itself was slightly ripped. I was a bit afraid it could've been damage, however, it wasn't damaged at all Amazon got me a bit worried with the shipment hahahaha.

The only reason I marked 2 areas with only 3 stars is because I had to base it on the lens that came with the camera, the kit lens. It isn't the greatest, but it's sufficient to work with while learning the 1,000 and 1 things this camera can do. (I have now purchased 2 other lens, a zoom and a macro and the pictures with them are simply great!)There are complaints out there that the camera is plastic. Piffle! It's solid as a rock. Anything they can do to minimize weight is fine with me. I have arthritis in my hands and the heavier the camera, the harder it is. I like the camera weight. The lens, of course, are heavier, so the lighter camera works good.When I first started taking pictures, I was disappointed. But, it also takes knowing how to combine the shutter speed, the f-stop and the ISO to get a quality picture. This isn't a camera you take out of the box and it works first time. If you want that, get yourself a Canon Powershot SX30 IS, which is what I had before. I love that camera still (versatile, lightweight and wonderful for quick shots). Super zoom, which I really liked.Rather than print out the manual for the 60D, which I can never understand anyway, I spent the extra money and bought the Dummies book for this camera. I took it on vacation, read and studied it and when I got home and the camera was sitting on the kitchen table waiting for me, I was already well versed in a lot of things. I still refer to it whenever I hear or read something I don't understand. It's a fantastic book and well worth the money.I had to buy a sturdier tripod and a larger camera bag to go along with the camera, too. But, it's money well spent. I would like to be able to take pictures without the tripod and I'm working hard to build up strength. It's clumsy to carry the tripod around, but I take a lot of shots where it works great and I'm pleased to have it.I am surprised at the length of the battery life. I keep checking to see if it's about to run out and it just seems to last a lot longer than I thought it would. I use the live view function a lot and that's supposed to shorten battery life, but I haven't noticed it.I haven't mentioned video because that is something that doesn't interest me.At the moment I'm chronicaling the life span of three black swallowtail caterpillars on the fennel in the front yard. When I took the first pictures 2 days ago, they were 3/8 of an inch long. Yesterday they were half an inch. I'm getting great pictures of those exceedingly tiny creatures with my macro lens.I've taken great bird pictures, blue jay, woodpecker, cardinals and squirrels getting into the feeder(!) and of course my flowers.

First of all let me say I am just an amatuer photgrapher. I upgraded from a Rebel XTi.  (1)SIZE: is not that much bigger or bulkier so dont worry about that issue(something i questioned) (2)PRICE: worth it; quality of photos is outstanding of course but now you don't need a camcorder(the video from this camera is BETTER than the video i shoot with a Sony HD camcorder!)  (3)LCD SCREEN: this is the biggest thing to catch everybody's attention(this is obvious when you go shooting at the zoo and see so many people with this model camera).  It works great.....but most of us shooting with DSLR's are not using the screen to take a photo.  It does come in handy for candid shots/catching somebody when they are not posing because u can hold the camera down by your side and line up a shot.  (4)SD CARD: If you are currently using a camera with a compact flash drive then this SD card is a much better choice.  Compact Flash storage is too easy to damage with all the pins....in my experience most photographers I know remove the card and put it into a reader rather than hooking camera directly to computer. (5)BATTERY: bigger than the Rebel's....holding strong so far.  On my outings I have taken about 200-300 photos each trip with half the battery charge left.  One hike was 8 hrs in 105 degree temps and I flicked the power off/on many,many times taking at least 200 photos and still had 1/3 battery life remaining(weight/size was not a bother in my hand and sometimes around my neck).Overall it's well worth the investment that will last you for years and years for either the parent, the amatuer, and even a professional.", "Date": "July 8, 2011"}, {"Title": "eos 60d", "Author": "terrence", "ReviewID": "R3ULSSLNXKEI23", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "i am from the old school, film, 35mm....  great feel, great features i love the fact that i can shoot until i fill my sd card not until i run out of film.  the video options are excellent.  this is my first slr since my f1, a1 days. i have a lot of catching up to do.  canon should take more chances in their tech features, ie faster fps at this lvl. this may be a entry lvl camera but it is still a investment.  weather proofing could be better, other wise great camera.", "Date": "June 16, 2011"}, {"Title": "Great camera", "Author": "K", "ReviewID": "R1MA4TIDTVGSZ7", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "After I decided to move up to a DSLR I went to Fry's Electronics and tried out many brands and many models.  I was looking for something that just felt right in my hands.The Canon 60D was the perfect camera for holding.  Other DSLRs are certainly as good or better in many respects but there is no getting around the fact that the 60D was the only one that I felt comfortable with.There are three things I wish it did better.(1) fast continuous focus in movie mode.and the next two could easily be added with a firmware update(2) I would like a choice of more exposures during exposure bracketing.  The Canon gives 3.  The Nikons give 3,5,7,9.  Handy for HDR.(3) I would like intervalometer built into the menu system.So other than a request for new features I really love this Canon 60D.  There are several books available for it and I really like (and own) \"Canon EOS 60D for Dummies\" and David Busch's \"Canon EOS 60D Guide to Digital SLR Photography\".If the camera died today I would get another tomorrow.  I tried to get one with the 18-200 Canon zoom but they are just not available in the states now.  I have the 18-135 which is a fine lens.  I could have obtained a 60D with a Tamron 18-270 but was reluctant because of some negative reviews on the image stabilization and focus at small F stops.  I tried out a Nikon D7000 with a 18-200 and was not impressed with the difference in image size as I zoomed out from 135 to 200 which helped me decide that I could be happy with the Canon 18-135.  The menu system on the 60D is way easier to use than the Nikons.

The Canon 320ex speedlite has a video light that can be use with the 60D and 600D, but apparently, according to the doc, with the 600D it has a continuous mode which allow the light to automatically turn on/off during shooting. I will get the 320ex soon, and will try to report if this is not available on the 60D.I hope that both of those are fixable by firmware and that canon will go the extra mile to bring that to us.But overall, I think that the 60D was a much better choice for me.", "Date": "May 3, 2011"}, {"Title": "Amazing product", "Author": "Basil A Ba-aziz", "ReviewID": "R1VBPA9U3O5LVD", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "this good product which give very amazing quality for Full HD photos and Videosthe limitiation is the SDCard Memory which is Maximum 32GB", "Date": "April 29, 2011"}, {"Title": "Excellent camera", "Author": "David Currier", "ReviewID": "R2Q3WC2Y5RGQK", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This was an upgrade to my original Rebel.

When the T2i came out I jumped on that as a \"knockaround\" lightweight cam that also offered backup capability.  But when the 60D dropped in price a bit I succumbed to it's \"siren call\".Primarily what I was after was the ability to disable AGC in the audio, I was doing \"double system\" audio using ZoomH2 and ZoomH1 recorders and having to \"synch\" up in post processing.  The AGC disable and manual audio level control in the 60D allows some projects to be accomplished without using external audio recorders although there is still not a way to \"monitor\" audio from the camera with headphones (one workaround for this will be to do a \"test\" scene on location and plug the media card into a laptop computer, checking both video and audio that way).Another appreciated feature is the articulating LCD.  Some camera angles get difficult because without a position adjustable LCD, the operator has to be behind the camera often with eye \"glued\" to an LCD viewfinder.  On occasion I may work by myself and have to get out in front of the camera, being able to turn the LCD to face the subject makes this a lot easier.Intermediate ISO's (as implemented on the 7D) are very useful to me and I was glad to get this in the 60D.  Another feature I like is the size, shape,\"heft\", and feel of the 60D, enough more than the Rebel series, but not the \"boat anchor\" feel the 7D can become.

Many of us can not afford the true professional grade product(s), nor do we need that level since we may not be actual professional photographers.  However, if you want something that has proven itself over the past several years of being manufactured (the EOS 60D is not the newest design), is of excellent initial engineering design, numerous capabilities, quality of manufacture of the camera itself, relative ease of usage, versatility, and simply allows you to create excellent photographs or video movies.If this is what you are after, then this is one of those currently available cameras for you.  This model is made in Japan, not China, Malaysia, Thailand, etc.  The 60D uses Canons a CMOS (Complementary Metal Oxide Semi-Conductor) type Sensor, and Canon's proven Digic 4 Processor for this model.  The EOS 60D camera is plenty fast for Shutter triggering and flexibility, Bursting is more than adequate, the articulating LCD is very handy, and of course this model accepts a wide range of Canon or quality aftermarket Lenses.  Without boring the reader herein with all the repetitious techno features - you have already read or can read about these - the bottom line is that the Canon EOS 60D is a proven excellent product that is in between the less expensive - or more entry level DSLR type product - and the truly very expensive professional grade Camera products.It comes with two Discs that enable the user/owner to have both a (300+ page detailed Users Operational Manual, and complete detailed Software Users Manuals' for Importing, Handling, and Modifying your Photos and Images).  Some of the current well know Camera makers have ceased providing an actual PC loadable Disc(s) for these purposes, and force you to obtain your user information via going to their on-line only sites, and viewing operational details in HTML Format only (ie):certain Sony's, which makes excellent camera products that I also utilize, but some with NO discs!  This is a real issue, and happens with several top camera makers to shave expenses.  My only personal disappointment with the 60D is that the built in Microphone for Movie Recording is Monaural vs. Stereo.  You can create and record Stereo Audio by using a second, external Microphone, which plugs into the Cameras side port - however, given that nearly all current DSLR Cameras of this level are stereo audio at this point, Canon should have adtopted accordingly.  Several similar products from Nikon are only Monaural also.

I recently have also purchased a couple Panasonic cameras as I think they have made great strides in the camera arena. I also have an FZ200 and a G5 which produce incredible IQ. I actually think it's on par with this 60D but i wanted a camera with a top of the line senser to get good IQ at high ISO's and this one is it. My G5 also does well but the Canon performs and feel s like a pro DSLR and it is. he IQ is incredible, lots of manual controls and the manual for this thing is great with lots of easy to follow instructions on how to work the camera. It also focuses very fast for action shots and i find the top window info screen very helpful for changing some settings in a snap. The thing is built like a tank. I got a great deal on Amazon for a Used like new for $770 with the 18-135 lens which is also fantastic so i couldn't refuse. The main things I have to have in a camera  (which this one had) are:- Great IQ- Articulating LCD- Viewfinder (hate taking photos looking at a screen.)A lot of cameras out there don't have an articulating LCD for whatever reason, well i know a lot of manufacturers like to keep the size of the camera down so they fix the screen to the back of the camera with no movement. I find that having this option opens up more possible photos from differnet angles and creativity. It really closed down my options and made it easy to select a camera. I probably would have had the Nikon D7000 if the LCD moved off tha back of the camera. I see a lot of reviews on YouTube making fun or having many people dismiss the LCD but I don't quite understand why. If you don't like it turn it around and keep it open on the back then it's just like a fixed screen. It is also nice to close down the screen and face it towards the camera when closing to protect the screen. I wouldn't be able to use a fixed LCD when taking pictures of the moon or anything high in the sky at night using a tripod. Or.. if your in a crowded area and need to move the camera up or around someone to get a pic, or.. if you decide to take pics of the rich and famous you can put the camera at all sorts of angles and get that money shot of Brad Pitt tounguing Angelina and sell it for the price you paid for all your cameras.. :-)Anyway a great camera and I am enjoying Canon once again!*** Update January 15 **Stll loving this camera and taking many shots with it. I have bought some lenses for it and have been using them for mostly action shots. I didn't get the L series lens becauee they are a bit too expensive for my budget but I did get the Canon ones which get great reviews for a mid grade type of lens. One lens everyone should have is the nifty 50 f1.8. I took some portrait shots with a softbox setup and holy cow the quality was amazing. The crispness and color rendition at f1.8 is flawless. I zoomed in all the way and had minimal noise if any at ISO 100. I mean if i had a cavity in my tooth i could see details on it, thankfully I don't :-)Action shots at the local park of birds and ducks was excellent also.

I won't list all the technical differences, but:1. the 60D is physically larger.2. The 60D uses an lp-e6 battery which holds more power than the lp-e8.3. The 60D has a scroll wheel that, for me, is more desirable than the clickable button interface found on the T3i and T2i. This makes navigating menus and manually changing the aperture a breeze.4. The 60D also had a display interface on top of the camera. This would come in less handy than I had expected. But... I rely on this display when I am doing astrophotography.So these are the main differences between the 60D and T3i that appealed to me. The conclusion was: for me, the 60d is a way better value than the T3i. So now I had to decide if I wanted to save some money and go for a T2i. This debate didn't last long. After some feedback from people who use the camera for video, it was concluded that the tilt/swivel LCD was awesome.And indeed it is. I use the swivel feature, as well as the scroll wheel the most. When I use this camera, I feel it is much closer to a 7d than to a T2i. But I don't like comparing the 60d to either of those camera. The 7d is a rugged beast that is perfect entry for professionals, and the T2i is probably the best bang for your buck you can get in the canon DSLR line.", "Date": "August 12, 2011"}, {"Title": "Going from a 40D to 60D...the good and the bad", "Author": "justmytwocents \"jason\"", "ReviewID": "R13XRTKIB50KI0", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I struggled with my decision to \"upgrade\" to this 60D from my 40D due to the controversy around this camera, and whether it was really an upgrade to the 40D[...]Here's why I wanted to upgrade to the 60D- swivel screen (you get some great shots that are just not possible when you have to look through the lens)- higher res screen (the 40D screen seems dated when you have an iPhone 4 to compare it to)- better low light performance (the 40D isn't bad, but couldn't compete with the iPhone 4 camera in low light)- wireless flash synchHere's what I was concerned about- plastic body (I had a rebel, then a 30D, then 40D...could I really step back down to a plastic body?)- loss of joystick control, smaller scroll wheel, and smaller LCD on top- CF to SD flash cardsStuff I didn't care about- video- higher mega pixelsFINAL THOUGHTS- it definitely feels cheaper between the plastic body and the loss of physical controls, but on the plus side, it's lighter and smaller, and feels sturdy enough...so if I can get my ego out of the way, it's a reasonable tradeoff...especially because I do a lot of travel photography- image quality and low light performance is not noticeably better to me than that of my 40D- the swivel screen is cool, but focusing and metering in live view is very disappointing...manual is the only way to go- frustrating to re-buy memory in SD format. A 16GB card with RAW + JPEG holds about 400 photos- screen resolution is phenomenal- wireless flash control is amazing, lots of new creative possibilities- video quality, while not important to me, is very impressive...but must be done in manual mode, autofocus is worthless- overall...I'm going to keep the 60D and probably put my 40D on eBay eventually...the \"upgrade\" is generally worthwhile...but it's a mixed bag.", "Date": "February 20, 2011"}, {"Title": "Great Camera", "Author": "J.

I wanted to upgrade from my XSi and the candidates within my budget were the 50D, 60D or 7D.  I went for the 60D as it is latest xxD version;  the 50D was only slightly cheaper and the 7D was quite a bit more expensive.  I bought the \"body only\" as I have several canon lenses.  I've only had the 60D for about two weeks now and love it, albeit I still have to learn some of the functions.  I am mostly a landscape photographer and shoot mainly at dusk or dawn.  I like the capability of the higher ISO's.  Like any photographer, I try to shoot at the lowest ISO I can use, but photos I've shot up to ISO 1600 come out good.  I didn't think the articulating screen would be a major selling point but it is.  Shooting portraits in the Live View mode is great.  Also, the LCD screen is protected when stored with the screen facing the camera--no more scratched LCD screens.  I use the viewfinder while shooting outside.  I haven't tried the movie function.  I need to try it just to make sure it works, but I doubt I'll ever use it.  I bought the camera for photos, not movies.

I just received it and checked out a few things to get a quick feel for it.UPDATE:I have used the camera for a couple of photo shoots (about 3000 shots). Regarding the LCD clarity, it turned out to not be a problem with the camera. It was customer error or in my case, customer stupidity. I could try to make excuse like the edges were indiscernible but the fact is I had not removed the protective film! DOH! Needless to say, minus the film, the LCD is crystal clear and the colors are great.Moving up from an XSi this camera is heftier and feels great in my hands. I use the battery grip and I find the camera to be very comfortable. My reasons for upgrading were for greater ISO and the extra 4 megapixels in image size. I occasionally print out poster sized pictures and I prefer to not have to enlarge an image. A feature that I wasn't aware of, is that the 60D has a shutter sync speed of 1/250 vs. 1/200 sec. That was a pleasant surprise.The higher ISO gives me much more shooting power. My XSi showed some noise at 400, noticeable noise at 800 and an extreme level of noise at 1600. I took a number of shots with my 60D at 3200 and they look very good. I am extremely happy with the picture quality of this camera!Note about ISO: The 60D allows 1/3 stop increments where as the XSi only did full stop. However, from what I have been reading, only Canon's 1 series uses partial stops when processing. When converting to jpeg, the other cameras (like the 60D) use the nearest full stop ISO and push the image to that value. At ISO 125, it pushes the image to ISO 100. If you set it to 160 then it pushes it to ISO 200. How that works is a whole discussion in itself so I'll leave it to others to look into it further. I just thought it was worth noting.Not surprisingly the 60D interface was a little confusing to me at first but once I got familiar with the layout it made sense. The 60D has a Quick Menu that displays a screen where you can make many of the most commonly used settings; what mode you're in, shutter speed, f-stop, ISO, exposure compensation for bracketing, drive mode,, flash compensation, picture style, WB, auto lighting optimizer, AF point selection, metering mode and image quality. It also has an electronic level. The dial and the On-Off switch are located on the left side and at least for me, being right handed, is more awkward. Fortunately, as I rarely have a reason to use the dial, it's not that big of a deal.The articulated LCD screen is extremely helpful when getting shots that don't allow you to compose through the view finder. I have been able to take shots right on the floor without craning my neck!I haven't even tried taking video with the camera since I didn't buy the camera for that.I have one issue with the camera but it's likely my camera and not an issue for the model...After I take a shot sometimes the image doesn't appear on the display or it flashes on the display. The image is there but doesn't get properly reviewed. I've gotten an error 70 that seems to be related to the battery. There is a thread about this particular problem in the Canon forums. I have to look into it. Neither issue affects my ability to use the camera.Anyone looking to upgrade from the Rebel line and isn't dead set on a full frame camera would do very well with the 60D.", "Date": "September 26, 2012"}, {"Title": "Huge Improvement Over my T1i", "Author": "Jody \"bigdumptruckdotcom\"", "ReviewID": "R10UJKUKPXCYW6", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "There were so many little things that I disliked about my T1i that when I had the chance, I upgraded.

Now that I have video, I could never go back to a camera that doesn't have it. The more I use it, the more I like it!! It is very addictive!! Just be preapred to buy lots of external hard drives if you like to shoot HD video a lot. The files are huge!! I also like the quick settings button. One of my favorite things to do is use it to adjust the white balance and be able to see your changes on screen instantly when using live view. This comes in handy when you forget your gray card or expo disc! You simply match the scene to your monitor to ge the true white balance. You see your adjustments on the screen as you are trying different settings. This is very helpful. I use the K setting a lot now. You keep adjusting the value until the scene matches the colors on your monitor.Some things I would like to see in the next model.When using live view & turning the manual focus ring, I would like a small square of the scene magnified 5 or 10 times (to get fine focus correct) but still be able to the the whole picture to make sure you are framing your shot correctly. This should be for still pics and video. When you stop turning the focus ring, the pic can return to full screen after a few seconds.I would like a dedicated video button. If you shoot stills and video together a lot it is a pain to keep switching back and forth.I don't like having to press and hold a button to be able to move the mode dial.

It should use a different beam of light.

I would highly recommend this as a first DSLR (depending on your reason for buying the system), but if you are looking to upgrade from the Canon Rebel Series then I'd skip this model and move to a full frame sensor system that offers greater compatibility with the latest canon flash gear.Pros:- Ergonomically designed.- Good construction / very durable- High quality images at lower ISO.- Decent Video (but I haven't done much with the video)- Easy to figure out all the controls and canon's interface is much more user friendly than nikons.Cons:- Crop sensor = Crop lenses. (May not be a problem if your demands from a camera system are relatively low)- Auto white balance is often off indoors and in shade.- Noise at relatively high ISOs (1000+ ISO).- Compatibility with newer canon gear can cause a few headaches.- Auto focus is hit or miss when running a high continuous shutter trigger.To me there are three kinds of people looking to buy a camera; the professional, the amateur enthusiast, and the consumer. Of course, I'm not going to address the professional here, as I am not a professional, just an amateur enthusiast.Consumer: You're the person who more likely than not just wants to snap really great family photos.

If you're gonna sink $700-$1100 bucks AND you plan on sticking with photography as a serious hobby or professional endeavor, you're going to eventually upgrade to a full frame system. You're going to do what I did. You're going to buy this crop sensor camera and crop sensor lenses and when you make the jump to full sensor you're going to have to buy all new lenses.

The flip out LCD screen is handy for camera positions where it would be difficult or impossible to view through the viewfinder.  Having the digital settings display on top of the camera is a nifty feature as well, also handy for shots where you may not be able to use the viewfinder. I'd looked at the T3, T5i, and SLi, and while lying more within my price range, all felt cramped in my hands (big handed folks take note!), and they did not offer the more rugged construction of the 60D.

All three share the same 18mp sensor, but I prefer this camera to both of those, due to its handling, and primarily the fully reticulated LCD screen. This allows shooting from multiple angles, down low, above your head, around corners, self-portraits, and self videos. The AF isn't as advanced as the 7D and the viewfinder is a bit smaller, but larger than the T2i which seems like looking through a tunnel by comparison. The camera body is polycarbonate instead of the magnesium alloy of it's predecessor the 50D. That doesn't bother me, it's still quite a substantial and strong body. The only feature I really wish they would have retained from the 50D is the lens micro focus adjustment.The T3i and T4i also have reticulated LCD screens and the T4i offers some features that this 60D doesn't, such as supporting the continuous focus while shooting video that is available in conjunction with two new Canon STM lenses, the Canon EF 40mm f/2.8 STM Lens and the Canon EF-S 18-135mm f/3.5-5.6 IS STM. If that feature is important to you, you should skip the 60D and go look at that camera.Others have given detailed reviews of all the features and performance of this great camera so I won't repeat that here. You can't go wrong with this camera; however, the 60D is getting a little long in the tooth. Even though it's a five star camera in every way and I've never had a single problem with it, it's been around for 3 years now, which is longer than any of the previous xxD cameras lifespan before they got an upgrade. In this same period, the top Rebel T2i got upgraded twice. Only the 7D has been around longer -- 4 years!There are rumors that the successor to the 60D -- the 70D, is going to be announced soon. (Spring of 2013.) Canon is reportedly planning a big jump in terms of specs from the 60D to the 70D, with the camera pushing toward more pro-level features. Of course, it will most likely come out with a more pro-level price too. But look for the price of the 60D to drop, and more 60D cameras to come on to the used market from people upgrading; that's always a good time to pick one up in good shape used at a very nice price.", "Date": "March 17, 2013"}, {"Title": "Best purchase of the year", "Author": "Karen Figy", "ReviewID": "R2ND8R0ZJWR5L4", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I am loving the detail and abitlity to set my manual settings where I want.

I tried full manual mode, auto without flash, iso at 6400 and lots and lots of other settings but the camera just would not attempt a shot at all, nada, neyt.  Several days earlier in a mountain top chapel in Moustiers (central Provence), in light so dim I could hardly see 8 feet in front of me and my eyes took minutes to adjust, the 60D took amazing photos on high iso and wide aperture settings.  Playing back the chapel photos revealed detail barely discernible to my eyes in the darkness, yet the brightly moonlit clearly visible to my eyes huge rock escarpment was for reasons unknown to me not something the 60D was willing to spend SD card storage space on, and yes there was plenty of room on the card, lots of battery power..yada...yada.  Extremely frustrating.  I hope there is an explanation that cites operator error.  More experience photographers have complained that the 60D does a poor job of autofocusing in low light conditions and perhaps this caused the camera to refuse to take the shot.Love many things about the 60D.  It is a much better camera than my photography skills warrant and many of my 1300 photos from this trip (writing review from hotel in La Ciotat, France) are nice due to it's capabilities not mine, but why the camera should second guess even a novice and refuse the shot is baffling.", "Date": "October 7, 2011"}, {"Title": "Great DSLR camera!", "Author": "chewie", "ReviewID": "R20KRYY4XFFCT6", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I debated for a while before buying a DSLR-- I wish I did'nt.

I chose it over the 7D because of price obviously, but I feel the 7D is meant for photographers with higher demands than me, especially those who need every ounce of speed for fast action, or can just plain afford it. For what I use the 60D for it is well suited (portraits of people, some wildlife, anything interesting I see).

That's all you need you need to know before buying. For a reasonable price, you get enough cam and lens to do it all and more if you add a canon flash, and perhaps a specialty lens if you have a particular need.  Other than that it's a great package and I love to shoot with it. If you are used to the canon user interface, it's very intuitive and in conjunction with some decent post processing software ( aperture for me), I can pretty much do it all.

It's true that as my first DSLR, I can't compare it to owning anything else, but I have used others, and this definitely compares well.Solidly built. I have bumped this camera around all over New Mexico for 6 months, with no problems. I got the 18-135mm kit lens, and it is simply superb. I do not think I would have been happy with the 18-55mm kit. This rig is a handful, but I don't mind lugging it around. I use a hand grip strap and much of the time when in a target-rich environment, I just leave it strapped onto my hand fairly comfortably, at the ready to swing it u to my eye and shoot. I recently added a Canon EFS 55-250mm lens, and it is a bit lighter, due to all-plastic barrel and mount. I love everything about this new lens, too. The design and build quality of the Canon high-end consumer line is outstanding in its class.As far as operation, once you learn the uses of the various modes and functions, there are no surprises. As an aerospace computer engineer who works with the controls and displays on military planes, this camera works the way I had expected in every respect, which is a very positive thing to say in my case. The Live View mode (where you use the LCD screen as a viewfinder) is fairly worthless, because it doesn't autofocus well in that mode. If you're shooting over heads in a crowd, you could go to Live View (one button press toggles it ON/OFF), use the articulated screen to line it up, switch it off and shoot. I have always preferred the conventional viewfinder anyway, so it doesn't bother me.  Also, I am still learning how to best keep it focused when using the video mode, but the videos are excellent. Before I start doing that a lot, I need to get an external microphone (about $60 for an acceptable one) that mounts on the hot-shoe.I got a couple of extra batteries (not much $), but the power use is so efficient and the capacity so good that I only keep the extras with me so that I'll have a fresh one on hand whenever the one in the camera happens to run low (after many hundreds of shots), and I might have expended two full charges in a long day of shooting once or twice.I work with an animal rescue group, so it's important to be able to repeatedly fire with no delay between shots or at power-on and come away with decent shots reliably.

I mean it fits right in between the t3i and the 7D, in terms of size, price, built quality, and performance.My original reason to buy this for filming and I picked this one over the 7D, despite the built quality difference, because it had manual audio level adjustments. So for those who mainly want it for filming and not much of photography, just go for the t3i, it's cheaper and it offers more than this.Now, even though the t3i is better in terms of video and my original purpose for it was filming, I've seen myself use it a lot more in photography so those extra fps come in handy when needed.

I've been shooting with dslr's for a little over a year and love it. I started with a t2i a couple of months after it's release. That camera was good to me but I grew out of it in about 2 months. Once I started shooting weekly I felt as the t2i wasn't durable enough due to it's weak platic feel. It also couldn't do things I needed it to do without going into the menus to make changes along with other things. I decided to look for upgrades in the canon family and was deciding between the 6oD and the 7D. A buddy I know stopped by my office and was showing off his 7D which I thought was nice but a little on the heavy side. It also has a higher price tag then I was looking to spend. I started looking at videos on you tube and found a video called \"60D training video\" it's from canon. Once I seen this video I immediately went out and purchased one. It has so many cool features for video and photo. The build is much better, the look with the swivel LCD , the grip fits my hand perfectly! When it comes to quality of the photos and video the t2i/60D/7D are not much different(also depends on your lens), Though I think my 60D performed better in low light for video.

This is my first DSLR however I have used for much of my life old film SLR cameras since I can remember.  So Digital is a little new for me outside of the simple point and click cameras.I have a Canon 50D at work and was planning on buying one of those for myself but the 60D was available for the same price so I figured I would go for it.  I am glad I did.  I have had the 60D for a little over a week and have already shot nearly 500 pictures with it and figure to go over a thousand this weekend.  This morning I had to do some work with my companies 50D and suddenly realized how much of an improvement the 60D really is.  Both are excellent models however the layout and control functions are much more intuitive with the 60D and the ergonomics are improved.The flip out swivel screen was one reason I was NOT going to buy the 60D.  I figured it was just one more thing to break and seemed kind of like a gimmick to me.  However after using the camera for a period of time and then going back to the 50D I realized why this was not the case.  From simply being able to fold the screen away safely into the camera so as to avoid scratches or nose prints when shooting to being able to angle the screen for better viewing I have found it to be very useful, well constructed and a better feature than the fixed screen on the back of the 50D (or other similar style cameras).one feature I am very excited about is the Bulb feature.  I honestly do not know if the 50D has this feature however it is clearly marked and accessible on the 60D.  this allows you to set up the camera and hold the shutter open for as long as you like by simply pressing the shutter button or using one of the remote triggering options (of course sold separately). This is great for night time sky shots and will be getting a lot of use.It is a Canon so you know that there is quality there and support as well as a full feature line up of lenses.  I have owned Canon point and shoot digital cameras in the past and many of the features and controls are very similar.  Canon enthusiasts should be able to pick it up and start shooting within minutes of familiarizing themselves with the camera.  However even those not familiar with canon products will find the basic functions of this camera easy to pick up and understand quickly.If you are interested in upgrading from the Rebel line of cameras and are looking to make the next step up from Amateur DSLR cameras of any make to a more robust system or if you are one of the remaining old film junkies who are looking to get a well appointed DSLR this camera should be on your short list for consideration.", "Date": "March 11, 2011"}, {"Title": "Canon 60d review", "Author": "dave b", "ReviewID": "R2CLB7TTRJ5YUK", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Pros:Excellent battery life.Excellent images.Flexibility.Tilty swiveley LCD screen.5.3 fps burst speed.Full HD video.Cons:I hate the on/off switch.Door to battery hard to open.It's kinda heavy.The left wheel should go all the way around.I've used the Canon 60d about 1 month now and I love it.

I am now, a not-so-proud owner of the latest Canon 60D for the past three weeks.I switched over from the film to the digital world with a Canon 20D. I bought an additional 40D mainly because of the electronic chip cleaning feature, and now purchased the Canon 60D because of its HD capability and the 20D is starting to show its age.Other people before me have reviewed the specific details and differences between the other Canon models, so I will not go there, but I will explain a few of my disappointments with the new 60D.1) The 60D does not have the magnesium frame, so the picture taking capacity rating goes down from 150,000 pictures to 100,000. Yes, this is an issue for me, but to be honest, not as much as I thought it would be. The camera does feel lighter, but that makes it actually a bit easier to handle and frankly, even with my 20D, I took ~26,000 pictures and had to have it repaired recently because the mirror switch gave out.2) From 6.3 fps to 5.3 fps. I often shoot wildlife action pictures, and that is 1 frame less which can make a difference between a good or a bad picture.3) The setting for taking HD footage is a major pain to get to. The user has to completely dial to the end of the different settings (I usually shoot M), and on top of that, you have to push a button in the middle of the dial to allow switching between different shooting modes. And yes, you cannot dial in 360 degree mode, so must go all the way back to the M mode.4) The remote release (TC-80N3) does not work anymore with this model. Likely because it is not a direct upgrade from a 40D/50D but rather an `upgraded' Rebel. In addition, Canon currently does not sell a bracket/timer remote control. Pearstone's RC-C1 seems to work though, but is additional equipment and additional cost.5) The autofocus system is the same as that of the 40D/50D, which is a disappointment after waiting for such a long time.6) The joystick dial is now replaced with an 8-directional dial, which is much more time consuming to use.Overall, I am disappointed with this move from Canon. The 7D is supposed to be the successor to the 50D, but then why is it $600 more expensive? Even if this logic holds true, why come out with a camera that has on purpose features to slow down normal operations (like the push button to switch between shooting modes, or the time it takes to switch between M and video).Yes, the video is great, yes, the megapixels are a nice upgrade from my 40D, but we are seriously considering returning this camera and looking at the Nikon D7000. The 7D without lens is almost the same price as the D7000 with lens and the specs seem much better for the D7000 then the 60D.

Which basically means they dont trust it to last more than six months before you have another \u00a3200 bill.A camera that needs such a regular repair is not a camera that can be relied upon by anyone other than the occasional shooter.The only solution is to leave the SD card in the camera permanently and hope that usb connector lasts long enough to see you get some use.searching the internet throws up many other users with this fault and leads me to believe the SD card writer fitted in this body is sub quality and prone to failure.As the card can be write protected in the Body, canon could easily release a minor firmware update to instruct the camera to ignore the card write protected fault, instead of stinging owners out who's warranties have expired \u00a3200 a time for a manufacturing fault.The 60d is a great camera, until it breaks ! then you own a door step.I shall not be repairing either body and will sell them both for spares and buy a SLR for HD video from another maker that does not break !", "Date": "July 5, 2012"}, {"Title": "Canon's mediocre quality control", "Author": "Florin", "ReviewID": "R29AR6IT72DVLB", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "This is my second Canon DSLR camera that comes with defective CMOS sensor pixels out of the box. The first was a Canon 450D, purchased in Europe.Yes, it's a great camera and I would still get a replacement but checking for dead pixels on the SENSOR should be a basic quality control on a camera that praises itself to be made in Japan.Moreover, not having any local repair shop in NYC is unacceptable for a company at this level. When I called their customer support they said I should send it to some remote location.This means wasted time on a product many people expect to use straight away, maybe even on an upcoming holiday.Such issues make me distrust this company a lot, if i had to go into dslr photography I'd chose Nikon straight away.If you want to make sure the product is ok and don't want any surprises, buy it from a local store and check it thoroughly![UPDATE JAN 2011]Allright, so I could not resist buying a second copy of the camera from a retail store in Washington DC where I got to test it on the spot for obvious failures.It would be cool if someone made a checklist of things to look for when testing a camera in the store, on the spot.For me, a good, quick test for dead pixels would be to switch on live view with the lens cap on. Any dead pixels will show up on the black screen, unless dead pixels appear black as well in which case, test on a white sheet of paper.Luckily this one was just fine and 3 months after having bought it i can say i'm extremely happy with it.I've recently compared it to my 450D which I haven't used since and it really feels a lot better (of course that's what new models appear for) but really, the grip is superb, the screen is vibrant and of great detail not to mention articulated (which I frequently use).Another thing that's awsome is the ability to remote trigger flashes. It even works with TTL for canon flashes which saves you from spending money on transmitters. For any strobist enthusiast it's a great feature!I've had one problem though, which was easily fixed and seems to plague more canon models.

I mean you need a great lighting to have a good picture at night or at dark places in general, just to get rid of the Grain it the clip. I was hoping to buy a Nikon D3S, but come on, there are like $2k difference in price between these two, just for this ISO issue ??? Besides, Canon 60d can capture 60fps in 1280x720, I just tested it and it was AMAZING!From the day you buy this camera, you just need to focus on lenses and have at least 3 of them for different purposes, because Canon 60d can handle any video or picture just like the way any other costly camera can do.It took me a month of seeking and thousands of reviews until I finally convinced that this is what I'm looking for.I may make a video review later.I really can't find any words to thank Canon for making my dream came true.", "Date": "November 17, 2010"}, {"Title": "Great, but you should know...", "Author": "Jennifer C. Hofstetter \"Jen Hofstetter Photog...", "ReviewID": "R2ZG09KWLUXBE1", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I bought this camera last week and it's awesome.  Picture quality is great, color is great, it's fast.  I've been using the Canon Rebel XT/350D, but I wanted to upgrade to something better.  I'm a budding professional photographer, but my business hasn't really picked up yet, so this is a great economic choice for an upgrade.Things to keep in mind before purchasing:1. Does not use CompactFlash memory cards like most other Canon models right now;2. Camera Raw is not compatible with Photoshop CS4 or older;3. *MAC USERS* CameraRaw files are NOT compatible with OSX 10.5 or whatever Leopard is.  There is an update you can download from Apple, but it only works if you have and older version of Aperture or iPhoto 8.  My Mac is from 2007, so I have an older version of iPhoto and there is no update for that.  You can purchase a Snow Leopard upgrade for $30.00, but I haven't done that yet, and I don't know if that will upgrade my iLife programs as well, making Camera Raw files readable.These are things I wish I'd known before I purchased the camera.  Canon says it's compatible with OSX 10.5, and the JPEG files are, but they don't advertise that CR files require OSX 10.6, as well as the newest version of PS.  :/  I'm a little frustrated since I just laid out a grand, and now I'll have to spend another $250 to upgrade everything else.  Add that to the new memory cards I need to buy (which I knew about, so no mark against that), and I might as well have bought the 7D.But, if you know all of this going in and don't mind it, it's a really great camera.  I love the swivel LCD screen.  I don't really like the fun creative functions too much, as the effects can be created with much better quality using PS, but a novice user might enjoy them.Layout wise, it's very clean and intuitive.  The menu is easy to navigate, the navigation buttons and wheels are great.  Personally, I don't like that the main dial is always locked, but I can see why it's a plus for most people.  AF is efficient, no complaints there.  I notice a LOT of noise at higher ISOs with basic editing, which I had read wasn't a problem, so I'm guessing that it's probably incorrect settings on my end, or the fact that I can't edit RAW yet.  We'll see.Aside from the additional costs of upgrading my computer and software, it's a 1000x improvement over my old Rebel.", "Date": "January 3, 2011"}, {"Title": "LOOOOOOOOOOVE this camera!", "Author": "hdpeters \"hdpeters\"", "ReviewID": "R2MK301OUUJ12S", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This is my first SLR camera and I LOOOOVE it after only 2 weeks!

Quality is great and it's fast,intuitive,easy to use and loaded with features.My problem is I had a 40D for 6 years which didn't have an articulating screen and it barely had a scratch on the LCD.I had the 60D for two days and the screen, although high quality, is totally scratches! I'm not talking about deep scratches from walls, metals etc.. I'm talking about those shallow but very annoying scratches. It's just a magnet for them scratches. I admit, I did not close the articulating screen all the time and I did walk with it open (flipped backwards). It does not change the fact the it is full of scratches from my SHIRT and my JEANS.I am pleased with the camera but it just annoys me the after only 2 days the LCD is fully scratched.. I assumed that if my 40D lasted so well (without screen protector)..I could live few days without a screen protector with my new 60D. I was wrong, now it drives me crazy.I know that I can send it to Canon for a not-too-expensive screen cover replacement but I don't live in the US and here it's not as easy to do.Another complaints worth mentioning:  Removing of the joystick was a mistake and the soft button ,that aren't giving any feedback, are not amazing..Apply a screen protector or close the flipped screen after every use!!", "Date": "May 14, 2013"}, {"Title": "Wonderful....", "Author": "mention21", "ReviewID": "R2J6T3TH4B23SN", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I purchased this camera for my birthday which was in march of this year and since then I've been putting it through is paces...i consider myself as an advance amateur...I've taken quite a few pics and i must say the picture quality is excellent once you make the proper adjustments...shutter speed is as expected...you can set to 3 fps or crank it up to 5 fps.

I chose the 60D because it is the latest model that still uses the same lenses that fit the 10D, and since I had two rather pricey ones, the Canon Zoom Lens EF 28-135mm and a 300mm lens, I wanted a camera body where these lenses could be used. (The 60D is compatible with all EF and EF-S lenses.)Key Features:18 megapixel (The 18 megapixel 60D is an amazing camera; I'm still discovering the differences), some of which are listed below.ISO - 100 - 6400 (expandable to 12,800)5.3 fps (frames per second) for ultra-rapid-fire shooting (58 large pegs, 16 RAW)Dual-layer metering systemAudio Video that can be set to automatic or manual with noise reduction filterVideo recording in HD mode with manual exposure controlIn-Camera RAW developmentSubject Mode Ambiance Selection (standard, soft, warm, intense, cool, etc.)Multi-control dial - offers a wide range of color variations (ambiances) that works much like Photoshop, but within the camera.In-Camera conversion - lets the user go from RAW to jpeg and apply new creative filters.In-Camera creation of special effects - this one works in RAW but not jpeg.The LCD Panel is a 3-inch screen that can flip out and be set at various angles.Movie recording capability.I've found that using the long-range lens in, for example, bird photography, the 18 megapixels give an enormous advantage for cropped photos. With the 10D, distance shots cropped were always a bit fuzzy, but the 60D keeps them in sharp focus.I am not a professional photographer and the 60D offers much more than I will ever use, but I like the autofocus, love the sharp images when cropping distance shots and love the ability to convert from RAW to jpeg within the camera. I would have preferred that Canon stuck with the magnesium alloy body rather than switch to plastic, however, the plastic body is considerably lighter than my 10D and seems sturdy enough for anything I'll put it through. I'm extremely pleased with this camera and give it five stars.

After hours and hours of research I went for the 60 because all reviews said if you want both that's it.well, the photos come out as expected even though it takes a while of digging through all the settings before finding what works best from all the menu options if you want the camera to do certain things.Where I'm disappointed is with the video function. Sure it does HD and if you focus before you start recording the quality comes out as promised. But forget about focused videos if you want to zoom or change distance to the object while filming. It doesn't autofocus!!! You can press the shutter release half way to refocus but the autofocus struggles to regain focus for a few seconds and is noisy. And of course it records this pitiful attempt.I was hoping to replace my 8y old Panasonic miniDV video camera with this camera plus my failing point&shoot; without having to buy a still camera & a video camera again but I guess this is not it to do so. Since the T2 and T3 have the same photo quality you may go for these cheaper models (with the same major components) and buy a dedicated video camera for the savings that will do a better job than the 60D.", "Date": "October 10, 2011"}, {"Title": "Do NOT buy CANON.

I've had it for 7 months now and it has been fabulous! It is a great starter camera for beginning, but serious, photographers. It is also $100 cheaper buying from amazon compared to the Canon website.One of my favorite features is the rotating screen. It makes it so much easier when doing self portraits or getting a really low or high angle shots. The screen for the camera is really great quality too!I would recommend buying the body only and getting a different lens, other than the one that generally comes with the camera. I bought the Canon 50mm 1.8 lens, which is a great starter lens and is only about $120. Very cheap for a lens!The ONLY downside to the camera is that while using the video recorder, the camera tends to get a little hot. It will even tell you that in the instruction manual. This really only happens when you record for long periods of time. If you record for over 30 minutes, the camera usually gets a little warm. I think it's so awesome that Canon put an HD video recorder on a DSLR, but there's definitely room for improvement in the future! If you plan on using this soley for video, I would recommend getting an actual video camera.The liveview mode was a little disappointing too because it takes longer than usual for the camera to focus. I was really excited about this feature but definitely let down in the end. I think this is another one of those camera features that needs improvement in the future!I definitely wouldn't let any negative sides of the 60D keep you from purchasing it!

The features are awesome.  If your only concern is to take good IQ pictures and you don't care much about the other advanced pictures, you can do with the Canon XS, XSI, and T1i. All these cameras are capable of taking great IQ pics depending, of course, if you know how to get the correct settings although Manual and P mode can also take great pics.My last camera was a canon T1i, and I loved it. The reasons I bought the 60D are follows:1. Vari angle LCD. I find this feature extremely helpful. I can take pictures from different angle with ease2. Faster FPS at 5.3. I watch college football and love to take action pics3. It has more features than the T1i and the AF system is fasterI don't really care about the pixel count as I hardly print my pictures. I almost always store the pics on my computer and post them on facebook or flickr. A 6 megapixel should do even for printing up  to 8 1/2 by 11. If you are planning to print pictures larger than that, it's the only time you would need higher pixel cameras, or if you plan to crop your pics so you would not lose any details.For the typical consumer whose only goal is to take nice pictures without having to worry about shutter lag, any of the canon, pentax, nikon (don't like sony) have the potential to take great pictures.If you are a prosumer, you can't go wrong with the 50D, 60D, or 7D. All these three cameras are great. It's all about your skill level and the features you prefer. I was going to get the Nikon D7000 as it has better features than the 60D, not to mention it is also weather sealed, but I really like the articulating screen of Canon that's why I chose it.", "Date": "September 29, 2010"}, {"Title": "Canon EOS 60D", "Author": "Charles", "ReviewID": "R24Q78HN3I1EP2", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I have a Canon 5D, a Canon 7D, and a Canon 50D.

Let me use my usual disclaimer, and admit that with so many good cameras around, it is more about what mix of traits or features you are looking for.On that note, the camera's trait mix is as follows. It has an 18 megapixels resolution. Most importantly, the sensor size is APS-C. That's just one step below 35mm Full frame.It has an optical viewfinder, which works through a pentaprism. The purists would argue this is the way it was supposed to be- that is, with minimal electronic intervention. As in most Canon DSLRs, it has a Dioptric adjustment to make it easy for people with glasses to use the viewfinder. Also, you can preview depth of field. The dust deletion mechanism includes a software adjustment for removing/modifying the affected pixels, self-cleaning sensor, and manual cleaning.The ISO rating is 12,800 and it works fairly true to specifications. The video is a Full HD. The camera gives you the option to control the exposure and focus manually, has an external flash option, and does RAW processing. You would need the external flash at least for portraits. The LCD screen is very clear with a whopping 1,040,000 resolution. It can be tilted for easy viewing in awkward situations. The sustainable burst rate- for fast action- is 5.3 frames per second. The camera body weighs 755 grams.Compared to the Canon T5i, 60D has an older processor. It has the Digic 4; T5i has Digic 5. It is also heavier, has lower ISO rating, and the LCD screen does not have the touch features.On the other hand, the 60D has a more advanced autofocus system than the T5i and lower-end EOS cameras. Peripheral focus is an option, whereas with T5i, if a moving object goes out of the central area, it does not get zeroed in. 60D also has a more durable body with environmental seals for extended rugged use. It has the touch and feel of a professional camera.A good camera, but its traits are a bit dated for its category.", "Date": "March 18, 2014"}, {"Title": "Canon EOS 60D is good for beginners.", "Author": "Jerry_Bai", "ReviewID": "RT77BWHQFEVI6", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I bought this in a 18-135 lens kit package. after I received it, I found that the seal label of outer box did not show up. and battery ships with camera was not charged. even 1 little small energy to open up the camera. so I go back to Amazon CS and verify what's going on here. normally I found every single package has one seal label on outer box to make sure that you bought this as brand new. Amazon CS was kind to send me the contact info of US Canon. and I sent a email to ask them why. and they said there was no seal label on the outer box. the reason of this is because retailer may check all the things in box and make sure they are perfect functional. and if they have some kind of promotion, they may need to put some memory card into box as a gift. and battery issue is battery may or may not have charge, this will depend on how long this kit being kept in retailer's warehouse. so no worries. after battery charged, everything is perfect.

So this is not going to be a verified buy...or whatever they call it. I bought this with a back up battery pack (I seldom ever NEED it) the canon bag, and some extra Extreme SD Cards (10 rating).Body: Who needs metal really? I don't see the point, this thing has perfect weight, can hold zoom lenses more stable than most cameras I have played with, and while yes the lense is a IS I had a Nikon DLSR that could not really support a IS lense that was up to 300 because the length was not supported by the body wieght. It does matter! But metal verses this ruggid plastic, not a issue at all for me. I like the rubber rough grip area because it is like built in no slip when I am handling it. It also fits my hands pretty well. The ONLY CON I have with this camera is the need for two hands to change a setting on the wheel...I have no idea what Canon was thinking but this is just a bad planning in my opinion! I have never had to deal with a wheel that locks and do NOT like it. However this one minor issue is well out-wayed by the performance and quality of the camera..so I overlook it...well except when I am cursing as I have to make a change and have to stop and do it with both hands...other than that I overlook it HA!Lense: Love the lense, great performance, nice glass, easy to clean, good wieght feels good, setting markings are there, great...what can you say? Only CON here...I cannot get as close up as I would like for macro shots...and for me that means buying a dedicated lense because I have a lot of things I want to shoot in this range for the art work I am doing. So for those who are wanting/doing macro shooting as a primary pls consider additional money for a dedicated lense...but don't rule this bad boy out...I just shoot and crop for now, but just really want more from the performance. Now as far as beach, arch designs, people, landscape, you cannot even begin to go wrong here!! It flat our rocks!!! Lighting is something I think we all play with, so enjoy because there are just a number of ways to play around with this. You can buy additional flashes and I am also considering this as an additional purchase as well, (mostly because I want to shoot light angles, for the art effects I am looking for), the built in flash, the adjustments and abilities of this camera are extremely amazing, so this is NOT a con at all.I keep my kit lense on the camera most of the time, and pack it in my Canon bag which fits just fine with lense cap on.I love the rotation of the viewer, mostly because it does protect the screen! Do I use rotation very much, not really. But have needed it a few times in tight situations, and when I wanted to get my straight lines in tact from standing low, or high from the shot I am taking this is great to have!Now for my everyday carry camera, this is not it. My back up is my G11 Canon, with the two cameras I have it all pretty much covered, and with great quality, excellent performance can't go wrong. I do need the dedicated lense due to what I am into shooting right now, but that is just me, not the camera itself.

I bought the kit that came with the 18-135mm lens.HeadshotsI must admit that I have done a photo shoot with an iPhone for and the woman loved it so quality comes down to the photographer.  I have had the camera for two months now.  It performs remarkably well in low light situations.  People are often surprised when they look at the view screen and see that it's brighter than the actual sky.  The images are crisp, the camera can work out some amazing math in auto mode.  Autofocus is quick although if I get too close the camera spends a lot of time trying to figure out what to focus on prior to taking the photo.  There is a work around for this so it's not that big of a deal.  The controls are simple to navigate but I'm not a big fan of pressing the button and twisting the dial to change modes.  My friend's 5D (which is not as straightforward as mine) has a nice feature where I have no button to push.  As I learn more, I'm sure I will not care about this at all.VideoI have a few options here.  1080p, 720p, 24fps, 60fps, and 30fps.  I am grateful for all of that versatility.  The video is crisp and looks very cinematic.  I have viewed it on a 55 inch flat screen and it is stunning.  I will be using two of these cameras to make a documentary.  Yes, it has a microphone but if you ever want to preserve the audio of an event you are at you MUST hook up a real microphone with a windscreen.  A lot of flexibility is easily gained by swapping lenses.  A completely different look is achieved easily.  A producer asked me about shooting a scene at night.  He was wondering how he should light it.  It was night so we went outside and I handed him my camera.  An associated turned on the LED light on her phone and acted as our subject.

The locking top wheel mode button is frustrating.  The flip out screen in the back is nice and being able to turn it around to protect the screen is nice but the fact that it flips out gives me something else to break on some trek through some far off land.It's almost like Canon wanted to kill the \"Prosumer\" line  and either make me an enthusiast or a professional. Sure the 60D has 18MP but if you want a more solid construction, you're going to have to go to the 7D and that's a ton more money.  Sad.  Truly sad that Canon has done this to this line.  I hope they bring back the solid prosumer line with magnesium cases and great features.  Just save your money until they fix this or just go buy a Rebel.This inconsitency is in the end the biggest issue with buying into a system like EOS.  You're at the mercy of the vendor.

I do not believe it was a mirror lock-up, I believe it was the built-in flash trying to open up.  This problem occurred 3 times.2.On at least two occasions I experienced a mirror lock-up.3.Camera had extremely poor quality for 18mb even with my 70-200 Canon L lens with soft subjects regardless of the f-stop.4.Macro and focusing problems occurred mainly on close-ups.

I have been working with digital cameras for 8 years and before that I had medium format cameras (2 \u00bc \" film) and 35mm film cameras without auto-focus so it is not that I do not know how to operate a simple digital camera, it is the camera not operating like a simple digital camera.Canon 18-135mm lens problems:1.I was not able to focus at times whether close-up or from a distance with this lens.

Though I did have times when I had to go fully manual while in Macro mode with my other lenses!2.I experienced an anomaly I never experienced throughout my career and that is vignette while the lens is fully extended to 135mm.  Vignette usually occurred when the lens is wide open (18mm) with the wrong filter or filters gang banged or the wrong lens hood attached.  The wrong lens hood being one that is not a lens hood for a lens as wide as 18mm.Webster's dictionary defines vignette as:(verb [ trans. ] portray (someone) in the style of a vignette.* Produce (a photograph) in the style of a vignette by softening or shading away the edges of the subject.I am returning this camera & lens today with the hope that I will not have any problems with the seller (Amazon)NOTE: In all fairness to AMAZON, I did receive a full refund within days of my return.  The camera kit was returned in the condition it was receive, even though I took over 850 photos.  After editing I could only use around 40.  I did have to pay $25 in return postage but it was better than getting stuck with a bill over $1,300. Thank you AMAZON", "Date": "January 27, 2011"}, {"Title": "Canon 60D", "Author": "Sheryl A.

I've long been a canon fan for the articulated screens that provide flexibility for shooting from the hip, both stills and video, although I've often found it difficult to switch between the two modes. I'm new to the DSLR world, and recently upgraded to the 60d from the Canon G12 for the purpose of gaining variable lenses to shoot video at the fraction of a cost for a decent video camera with comparable lens. I've owned the 60d for two weeks now, and have found the transition to zoom lenses relatively easy, and there's an obvious improvement to image quality for both stills and video. Since my use is primarily video, here's my initial reactions to utilizing the camera, while occasionally taking stills and primarily shooting video.Pros: Clear and crisp stills. Easy to understand menus and buttons that are similar to the G12 and most Canon point-and-shoots. Big articulated screen that folds away nicely when not in use, or opening wide when needed. The 60d takes SD cards, which are more portable and commonplace than Flash cards. The battery life is much longer than the Rebel. No real advantage for shooting video by upgrading to a full frame camera, so this is a relatively inexpensive DSLR. Canon 60d has more megapixels than the nikon d7000.Cons: For video the Nikon D7000 is better. Hands down. I understand the Nikon D7000 does real-time auto focus (although it is loud), the 60d does not. For switching between stills and video, the Nikon D7000 has a quick \"jump to video mode\" switch accessible to the right thumb, while the 60d requires the user to unlock the scene selector dial and scroll to video mode with the left hand requiring an extra 5 seconds of visual inspection and transition. Without this \"jump to video mode\" feature on the 60d, I must move the camera to visualize the dial and completely lose aim on my subject.Conclusion: I didn't do my homework before buying the 60d for my video needs. If you're looking for a fast transition between stills and video, or you want auto-focus for video, then I'd pay the extra 200 bucks for the Nikon D7000. I'm invested in the Canon lenses already, so I'll have to wait for the next innovation from Canon to catch up with the superior video features already offered by Nikon.", "Date": "March 29, 2011"}, {"Title": "Do your research", "Author": "Steve D.", "ReviewID": "R59R8XB44MBBC", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Here's the deal:  If you're reading this or anything about this camera you're probably looking to jump to full-frame.  If you've already got Cannon glass and action photos aren't going to be a big part of your future (it will do them, just not as well as some others) then this camera should be very high on your list.I rated this 5 stars because this camera does what I want it to do.  It takes beautiful pictures of people and landscapes in a wide range of lighting conditions.  I can push the ISO and get very nice pictures at ISO 3200 and beyond.  I can shoot indoors with no flash.  I can shoot night shots, and glorious landscapes in the blue and golden hours (really more like minutes).All on-line hand-wringing aside, it focuses very well, but probably not well enough to make it an action shooter.  If you want to shoot sports with a telephoto get something else, probably a 7D, unless you can afford really long glass then go get a MK III or a IDX and hang an $8,000 lens on it.But if you want to shoot people at normal distances, urban photography, and beautiful places, then this camera is all the camera you'll want.  It is smaller, lighter, and cheaper than other full frame options.  Other cameras will do it as well, but they're heavier, bigger, and more expensive.  And anything smaller and cheaper is a crop sensor that simply can't do it as well.  It just can't.The 6D will take some learning.  The buttons are probably a bit different than what you have, but so was every other camera you've owned.  You learned those.  You'll learn these.  You give up direct control over white balance, but it isn't a big deal, just a couple extra button presses and an extra 2 seconds of your time once you get good at it.  You probably leave it on auto WB, anyway, like I do.The wi-fi is cool but it takes a little while to set up, more than a few seconds.  I'll use it, someday, I'm sure.  GPS tagging will be cool when I'm in the middle of nowhere, which I am from time to time.  When I'm miles from anything I'll be glad this camera is lighter than the alternatives.Low price entry into full frame, extremely low noise at high ISO, a few less bells and whistles to offset the price.

In some cases I think Canon made wise choices with the 60D - for example going to an all-plastic body (as opposed to the magnesium body of the 50D) enabled Canon to decrease the size and weight of the 60D while still having a solid tough camera.Unfortunately there is one glaring omission from the feature line of the 60D, which is called microfocus adjust (MFA).  MFA allows the user to slightly calibrate the focusing of their individual lenses with the camera.  In many cases MFA for a specific lens / camera combination is not needed, but occasionally the user will get much sharper pictures by setting up MFA for a specific lens / camera combo.  For instance with my current Canon 7D most of my lenses require little or no MFA, but one requires a fairly large adjustment of -7 to function optimally.With the 60D, users may find the certain lenses just don't producer sharp pictures.  And without MFA, the user is unable to find out if a simple MFA adjustment would correct the problem.  As such, I'm not impressed with the 60D as a prosumer / semipro camera.  If you just want a nice DSLR you can save money and get a Canon EOS REBEL T4i 18.0 MP CMOS Digital Camera with 3-inch Touchscreen and Full HD Movie Mode (Body Only).  If you want a true prosumer DSLR you best bet at the moment is to actually get a used Canon 50D or upgrade to the Canon EOS 7D 18 MP CMOS Digital SLR Camera with 3-Inch LCD (Body Only).Note: the 60D's price has dropped dramatically recently, making it an easy choice over the t4i.

The Bummer of them all is that I had a Canon 85mm f1.8 tied on it at the time of the POP & malfunction. It blew the electronics in the 85mm lens. When I put the 85mm on the working T2i, the T2i said error #1 \"clean Lens Contacts\" well you can clean them & the camera contacts untill the cows come home because it is not going to work. The other Canon lenses, 18-55,55-250 & the 50mm all work on the T2i. Since there is no power in the lens, but instead in the camera. The glitch has to be in the camera & when it blew everything in the camera it must have blown the electrical contacts in the 85mm. Fortunately the 60D blew well before the 30 day return period so I only lost my $30 on shipping.

So I bought 60d and paired with 15-85mm lens. Costed lot of money but well worth it. The pictures are coming sharp and the whole unit looks so robust in hands. I still have to learn a lot to set the iso depending on lighting situation. The difference in picutres between t4i and 60d the colors. T4i pics are very vibrant looking than 60d. Probably the digic 5 vs digic 4 processors. I have small hands but 60d fits comfortably and have nice grip compared to t4i. I also have nikon d7000 but some how I am in love with canon products. I highly recommend 60d with 15-85mm lens. Dont buy 18-135 or 18-200 they stick out too much from camera and long range is not that important. The camera should look compact when you wear on your neck and at the same time it should have enough zoom range. I also took video with 60d and not that impressed. but for still shots its good one. I also looked full frame 6D and it was too big on my hands and looks bulky and it has no built in flash either.  remember all decent cameras are capable of taking great pictures but the user needs to learn the focusing/ligthing/shutter speed to have great pictures. 60d is on sale and grab it while it lasts as I heard canon will replace it with 70d soon. shoot me any questions you have.", "Date": "June 10, 2013"}, {"Title": "I loved my new digital camera!!", "Author": "Gonzalez Martinez Maria Martha", "ReviewID": "R2TIBLIZL4PCBU", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Thanks amazon because my new digital camera  Canon EOS 7D, was the next step in my passion for photography!!As always congratulations for accomplishing your time of arrivals and addresses!!", "Date": "June 1, 2013"}, {"Title": "Canon EOS 60D is finicky with the Class 10 memory card", "Author": "Rosendo Yu", "ReviewID": "R2POVRMI9ITGR5", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I bought a new 60D in late December.

I dont usually write reviews and complain about anything, but with the amount of money I paid for this, I felt the need to air out my frustrations over this product. It takes two hands to operate this camera, compared to the T1i which was a dream to handle. Power button and mode dial on the L, menu/shutter buttons on the right. It seems I continue to struggle and twist my hands just to operate the 60D. Its a control geography nightmare that resembles the earlier netbooks with the mess up shift key(for those who can relate). There is just no excuse for that kind of design mishap. I sure wish Canon consulted photographers before designing this because, its bothering me more than i thought it would. Unfortunately, I would have to endure it for now. The T2i, which is a lower model, would have been a better choice. Or the 7D, if you could afford it. Just be aware of this major flaw before purchasing. The 18-200mm lens is not  perfect but I am happy I get to lessen my lens changing. I do miss the extra 50mm from my old lens. Maybe they would create a 18-300mm, that would really be something for us photographers who get lazy to switch lenses.

First off I would like to tell you that I am not Ansell Adams or some great photographer, I'm just a guy who wanted to buy a camera. I am not going to sit here and tell you that this is the greatest camera in the word or that it's an entire waste of money. I am not going to tell you that U.S. Navy SEALS use this camera, (because truthfully they want to use a camera they use the Hubble Telescope) or that this should be the DSLR (digital single lens reflex) camera that you should get. What I can tell you is how and why I picked this camera and what I got with it.I took some photography classes back in high school before the time of digital cameras and wanted to get back into it so I started on Consumers Report, C.R. gave the top rating for DSLR to the Canon EOS D60. From there I started to read reviews from other sources and compare prices on other cameras. Some gave great reviews some gave lesser reviews stating that the D60 was a step down from the D50 it is replacing. When it was all done and over with my choice was made over cost.The D60 I feel is the first camera in the line that gives you full control of the settings a photographer wants to use to get amazing photos. The 18 megapixels and the large 22.3 x 14.9 mm sensor was the next determining factor. To move up any higher is to spend a lot more money and get in the professional equipment realm. I also went with just buying the camera body and purchasing a Canon 15-85mm 3.5 lenses which is a much better lens than comes with the kits.So far I am very impressed with the camera and have worked with some Marine Combat Photographers (who use Canon D7's) and they are very impressed with it too. One recommendation I will make is if this is your first DSLR camera of you are not very comfortable with one pick up the book \"Canon EOS 60D Snap shots to Great Shots by Nicole S. Young\" Canon EOS 60D: From Snapshots to Great Shots  which is a great book to get you acquainted and educated on  all the features and settings of the 60D.", "Date": "May 22, 2011"}, {"Title": "A Lot of Bang For Your Buck", "Author": "shooting stuff", "ReviewID": "R3MHRXZCE7UOG8", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "The much anticipated 60D does not disappoint.

This 60D body and other items (EFS 15-85 lens, lens hood, and SanDisk memory card) were shipped from Amazon warehouse in Kentucky. The serial number at the bottom of the camera body (167102887) is different from that is printed on the camera box and warrantee card (2821413097), a clear evidence that an USED / refurbished camera was shipped in a new box for the price of a new one. There are many scratches and fingerprints all over the camera body, especially on the LCD screens, around the tripod-mount slot, and inside the battery compartment. The lens-mount is spotted and scratched from previous use, and the sensor is v-e-r-y dirty/dusty, as one can easily see it through the viewfinder. The accessories, especially battery that came in the box were also used items. So the question is: what happened to the camera with the same serial number as on the box and vice-versa and how did an USED camera get into another box, which it did not belong to?Now, Amazon did replace the original (used) camera immediately and the replacement arrived (shipped from Orlando) in pristine condition with matching serial numbers. They also offered a $100 store-card, part of which I spent on a B+W MRC filter (a $50 item). Shockingly, the filter that I received was also used/damaged. The tamper-proof seal of the box is broken and scratched.I hope Amazon accepts the fact and publish the review and clean up the mess.", "Date": "February 21, 2013"}, {"Title": "Good for still shots mid day.", "Author": "William D.

I have been one for 60 years.  My latest methods of capturing the illusive image have beed the Canon 30D & 60D Digitals.  Many years of shooting film have preceded these.  What a great advancement digital.  No film to run out of.  No processing to deal with. Cheap fun and great results.  Now the problems arises.  I get home from a photo expedition and download my achievements to my laptop and see dark spots all over my \"prints\".  What the ?  Turns out to be a common problem with digital cameras. What to do?  Google.  \"Clean the Sensor\" they say.  OK. Order a kit for $100+ and proceed to clean the sensor.  Right.  All I can manage to do is move dirt around or make it worst than it was.  Clearly this task is beyond my humble abilities.  I will send it to Canon and have it done \"professionally\". Right. The camera comes back and I anxiously head out for a day in the field.  Get home, download.......WHAT?  They have removed maybe 50% of the dirt and moved the remaining 50% to new locations. I now have two expensive camera bodies.  Five quite expensive lens and am unable to take a decent photograph. Come on man!  I have just ordered a new Canon SX50.  My hope is that the dirt cannot find it's way to the sensor if the lens is not removable.  Will it do what my array of previous equipment could do?  No.  I will especially miss my 10-22mm.  In the great expanse of what is our American Southwest, it was a wonderful lens. One that cannot be replaced with even the best point & shoot. So this review is not so much a downplay on the 60D.  It is a 5 Star, wonderful camera.  It really is a generic problem.  Just wish I could deal with it.  Will the SX50 fix the problem?  I honestly do not know.  I certainly hope so.

Whether this all worked or not is not the issue - the issue is that for a $1000 camera one expects a certain level of quality which alas is sadly lacking in this Canon product.  I'm extremely disappointed in this camera especially as my last Canon was a Powershot with which I was thrilled and still use.  Thrilled hardly describes my experience with the 60D which will now need to go in for fixing, and if unsuccessful will be traded in for a non-Canon camera as its not acceptable as is.To the question would I recommmend this to a friend?

I would like to make the following clear - This is a review for a specific camera unit that I have received and tried.  I have not tried another Canon 60D body.  So it is very possible that my unit was defective.  However, I have seen full resolution images posted on various regular review sites and those images are soft (to me) as well.  To those telling me that I don't know how to properly use a DSLR - while I am certainly not a technical expert at all the various DSLR technology out there - I do expect to get a good, sharp image quality from a $2,000 camera/lens combination SOOC (STRAIGHT OUT OF CAMERA).  I do post process my images, but it is unacceptable to me that I have to spend this amount of money and then spend my time Post Processing the most basic stuff like standard image sharpness. And again - just to make sure you have read my details - I have tried Nikon D700 with several lenses as well and the difference between the BASIC image quality (like sharpness and DOF) on Canon 60D unit and the Nikon D700 unit that I have received from Amazon is night and day (in Nikon's favor).-----------------------For now, this is a short, high-level review.  I will update it with more details when I will have time.I was extremely excited when I heard that Canon released 60D.  My current tool of choice (that I now had for 5 years) is Nikon 8800 Pro-consumer camera (not a DSLR).  I have always been a Nikon user and started with Nikon 35mm DSLRs (FM & FE) - still have those great cameras.My primary photography output are artistic photographs (fotografyart) - I am not a sports or a wedding photographer.  So my needs are very different from most other folks.  One of my most important needs is an articulated LCD.  The type on 60D is exactly the same as I have on my Nikon 8800 (except of course, the technology is newer by 5 years and the screen is larger). The fact that Canon 60D has 18MP was huge for me - because I produce large prints.I was extremely excited when I got the camera. I purchased only the body - because I was not sure what glass I wanted to use.  In preparation for the camera, I have rented 3 zoom lenses (2 mid-range and one L class) - I will provide the specifics on the lenses with another update.Bottom line after my testing - EXTREMELY DISAPPOINTED with the camera!  I can tell you it was not the lenses.  What is the ultimate measure for the camera - of course it is the output of the images.  I cannot believe how crappy the images are.  The depth of field is so shallow (even at f32 - lots of discussion on diffraction starting around f11) - soft, soft, soft images.  Looking at those mushy images made me feel like I stepped into molases.  Canon has done an extremely terrible job by playing the megapixel game - who cares about it when the image is pretty much useless?I was comparing my output to my Nikon 8800 (an 8MP 2/3 image sensor).  The images and optical quality of my Nikon 8800 blow this camera out of the water.  After cranking sharpness on 60D all the way up, the images were still pretty much unusable.  I am not talking about looking at images on the web at 72DPI.  I am talking about looking at images at full resolution.  I know that people will say that I am comparing apples (8MP 2/3) to oranges (18MP APS-C), but again, the result is ultimately what you print.  I have not printed the images, but I did compare them to my images from Nikon.  I have printed photographs from my Nikon 8800 up to 36\"x24\" with crystal clear sharpness and no pixelation.  There is absolutely no way I would be able to do this with Canon 60D. Needless to say, I have returned Canon back to Amazon (great service, by the way - I would buy ONLY directly from Amazon).I have read many reviews before I ordered Canon 60D camera, as well as on Amazon.  Everybody has different needs and are looking for different things in the camera.  Based on my ouput requirement, this camera is not for me.  After this experience I have tried Nikon D700 (yes, I know it is FX) - like night and day.  I really think Canon has lost the edge with their image quality.  Again, I will provide more info later.  By the way, if you think I am making this up (I thought I was hallucinating at first), there are multiple discussions in on-line forums, because 7D apparently is having the exact same issue.", "Date": "November 17, 2010"}, {"Title": "This camera has a promblem storing memory", "Author": "Ricky White", "ReviewID": "R3P96UYCRAUI15", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I recorded off this camera and try to playback some of the image, but they would randomly erase, even when i switch the SD card", "Date": "August 20, 2013"}, {"Title": "Best for the buck", "Author": "Mr. Hodges", "ReviewID": "R1NAXQA1P969SX", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I was wanting to get into a camera that was built on the CF (Compact Flash) card instead of the SD card.

If you bought this 60D together with the 18-135mm kit lense, check your video mode and make sure you like it. Rotate the dial to video and hold your lense close to your ear, you will hear some kind of static noise coming out from the lense. Just on video mode only. The noise is being recored into the video and you will hear it while playing the video on your LCD TV. At first I thought I just got a bad unit so I returned the first unit and exchange for the second one, however, i still got the same type of noise on the second one. So, the conclusion is, Canon has a bad design, not bad units!!I actually bought both 60D and the Nikon D7000. The D7000 is just so pretty in every aspects. The feeling, the features, the sound, the quality, etc. It really makes the 60D looks ugly. You won't realize your wife is ugly before you met your sexy gf. Besides of the noise from the video mode from the 60D, everything else are just noisy. The lense is noisy and even the shutter sound like you accidentally slap on your own face while chasing down that irritating mosquito. The dial is rough in 60D and the D7000 is just nice and smooth. D7000 is just driving a Lexus on the freeway and the 60D is just a Jeep rolling down the hill of the valley. I think the noise from the lense + the shutter + the dial will probably more than enough to piss that guy sitting next to me in the concert!! He'll ask me...\"..do you mind??\"Anyway, both of them have good picture quality. D7000 has a lot more features. Haven't checked the other Canon lenses yet if they are making the same type of noise on video mode since I'm new. Will buy more lenses later.

But what they don't tell you is that the 60d is not compatible with Adobe Camera Raw CS4.  So if you do a good bit of your work flow in Camera Raw and don't have and cant afford CS5 you are screwed.  The Raw conversion program that comes with the camera is crap compared to Adobe Camera RAW.  If this is not going to bother you then I'm sure the camera will be great.I've taken a few low light shots with it and it works like a champ, but the photo shop issue is making me consider returning this camera.", "Date": "November 23, 2010"}, {"Title": "hosam", "Author": "hosam", "ReviewID": "R1PI00NRPVH47P", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "A camera that had requested was not up to now will not be held for the camera etc.thank you bay", "Date": "October 2, 2013"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": "$1,199.00", "Features": "18.0-megapixel CMOS sensor and DIGIC 4 Imaging Processor; ISO 100-6400 (expandable to 12800)\nIncludes 18-135mm f/3.5-5.6 IS UD standard zoom lens\nImproved EOS HD Video mode with manual exposure control; Vari-angle 3.0-inch Clear View LCD monitor\n5.3 fps continuous shooting; enhanced iFCL 63-zone, Dual-layer metering system\nCompatibility with SD/SDHC/SDXC memory cards (not included)", "Name": "Canon EOS 60D 18 MP CMOS Digital SLR Camera with 3.0-Inch LCD and 18-135mm f/3.5-5.6 IS UD Standard Zoom Lens", "ImgURL": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/5163UrUy7qL._SY300_.jpg", "ProductID": "B0040JHVC2"}}
