{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Comfortable yet awkward - updated", "Author": "V. Vanderbent \"always curious\"", "ReviewID": "R9B3IOZECBXL", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "The pictures come out really well and almost professional looking. The camera responds well, feels really comfortable in the hand, with the controls easily accessible and responsive. I was looking for an inexpensive camera like the Nikon P100 but without too many picture taking compromises and without AA batteries. So the X90 fits the bill, yet, the missing lens thread, manual pop-up flash and the childish scene options interface make it a bit awkward overall. I am tempted to keep it though because it is pretty fast in startup, while less so in flash charging, light weight and capable of tremendous zoom. It looks great here on Amazon but rather amateurish once I opened the box. Of course, I shouldn't expect that much from a camera in this price range, and perhaps I should just appreciate the terrific picture quality this baby is capable of - so thanks Pentax, a job well done albeit it a bit lacking in some regards, Wish I really could have that Fuji E900 in an upgraded version, but the Pentax X90 will do for now.UPDATEDAfter taking a number of shots with the camera over the past few weeks I can say that it performs remarkably well. Sure, it's not a professional camera but the clarity is astounding at this price point. The image stabilization is world class IMHO. Both at macro and tele, the camera performs excellently. There were a few situations in which it underperformed. A friend's Samsung P&S; was able to get better backlit portrait shots (the background came out much better - but that same Samsung did a terrible job with any other portrait shot so Pentax left it far in the dust overall), and I had to adjust the flash to -2.0 to reduce the strength. The default settings of the camera have the flash set for super bright and white balance to wash out most colors. This is adjustable once I became familiar with the menu options. What I really, really like about it is that it remembers all your custom settings. I have one at Program, Scene, and Manual. Each time I want to take three different shots to get a variety of results in difficult lighting conditions, all I have to do is turn the dial to another mode and it automatically returns to my previous setting. When I couldn't get a good outdoor portrait shot of my wife, I turned to Manual mode, adjusting the aperture such that I got good exposure with the flash and in the background. The options are virtually endless! The camera says it's made in Indonesia if that is important to you. Excellent job Pentax!PROSNumerous customization options for the beginner and advance amateurSuperb image stabilizationRelatively small sizeExcellent fit and grip for average size handsExcellent image quality for the priceLi-Ion battery for large number of shotsCONSAwkward menu options, takes many clicks to get what you want (but that's too be expected considering how many options there are)Awkward lens cap (comes off easily)Build quality average, when you shake the camera you can feel the lens moving about a littleCharging unit comes with separate cord. The plug should have been built in for easier carrying (like Panasonic in same price class).No lens thread. This is actually a major disadvantage because a polarizing filter could make lots of outdoor pictures with this camera much better than they already are. In this economy, Pentax should have taken the trouble to put a thread in, even if it were plastic, IMHO.UPDATED JANUARY 12, 2011Since Amazon has it back in stock, let me expand a bit on my experience with it. After several months of extensive use, I no longer find the lens cap issue to be a big problem. Even though I put the camera right into a shoulder bag with other items or in a backpack or briefcase, the lens has yet to get scratched by anything. The cap comes off quite easily, but that's actually an advantage too, I flip it off with a finger of the same hand that's holding it. The viewfinder is excellent and gives you all the info you need. I make much more use of it then I thought in the beginning.Image quality in wide angle mode is pretty amazing overall. The only problem I find is with the panoramic function. It could be just me but I have the hardest time lining up the overlapping parts. The camera guides me through the process so it should be a piece of cake but the results are always off somehow.Now that I live close to the beach I take more wildlife and surfing pictures. Chromatic aberration is noticeable especially at the longest zoom setting in higher contrast situations. I love the long zoom, rarely do I take pictures in between the wide angle and farthest zoom setting.VIDEOI have yet to get any useful video out of the camera. It's always overexposed and jittery.

I have taken well over a thousand photos and am thoroughly impressed with the camera overall. The super macro is outstanding. I have taken so many close ups of very small things....(Ex. Ladybug eggs, small dragonflies, water droplets on greenery)that numerous people have asked me what camera am I using. I have also taken some really cool digital zoom photos as well. I am an amateur photographer and have used Fuji, Hp, Pentax SLR 35mm. I find that every photographer and their camera will not take perfect pictures 100 percent of the time but if you read your manual and enjoy taking photos you will not only find awesome ways to use this camera but you will not want to let go of this camera.Some Pros:Amazing super macro, digital zoom, anti shake, many shooting options, ease of use, fun pre-installed picture frames, night time with flash, good size screen, viewfinder, battery charges a quick hour and a half. A cinch to connect to PC.Some Cons; lightweight, not enough rubber grip, I would have liked a larger grip area, lens cap(but similar camera lens caps generally come the same),battery life about 200 or so pictures. Picture playback option a bit awkward (have to hold power button and play button together? Just play button would have been fine.Conclusion.... At the new much lower price (Price was higher when I bought it) I would tell you to jump with both feet! Awesome camera for this price point Period.

I took a bunch of shots out on the water on a very blue, sunny day and was extremely pleased at how well they came out.  The zoom is fantastic.  My favorite feature by far.  The only feature I'm not fond of is the flash and the fact that you have to manually turn it on before you can use it.  After using a point and shoot where the flash was 100% automatic, it is difficult to remember to turn the flash on before you take the shot.

Some of my photographer friends helped me learn some terminology and made recommendations, but in the end, I had to make my own decision.The Pentax X-90 has the features you'd find on hybrid cameras heavily advertised on television, but costs much less.  It's not terribly heavy, offers tons of options, and is easy to use.  If you buy the special memory card, you can also transfer your media from the camera to your computer wirelessly.Image stabilization is awesome on this camera.  My hands always shake a little, making it difficult to get clear images, especially in low light.  Don't get me wrong, for some photos,  you still need a tripod, but I was surprised how crisp most of my photos are.  I love the electronic viewfinder, too.  The LCD screen is pretty good in the sun, but nothing surpasses a viewfinder on a sunny day.Getting started is easy, too, because there are settings for many situations, like sports, portraits, and landscapes.  You can even set the camera to automatic if you want.  The placement of the buttons and the icons is quite intuitive.  I was changing settings every which way really quickly, something I'm not able to do with my point-and-shoot.Now that I have this camera, I may become a hobbyist.  This camera is fun to use!

I take hundreds of pictures a week - mostly of children and events they participate in, as well as crafting and such to put on my blog (a good mix of indoor and outdoor conditions). My old point and shoot finally died, so I figured this would be a great time to move a step up. Paying two and a half times more than I paid for my point and shoot, I figured having clear, beautiful pictures would be a given. It wasn't. I was very disappointed in the quality of the photos this camera produced - soft edges, grainy, and very poor color. In fact, I had two big outdoor events to cover, and it was snowy. Most of those pictures were washed out, and snowy areas were so bright white that they only showed up as glare, and not clearly defined snow. Inside was just as bad, even set on the portrait mode, faces had areas of glare so bad that there was an absence of color on cheeks and foreheads. I have a wonderful SLR - very old Nikon camera, and used to be a reporter, covering hundreds of events for our local paper, so I do know how to use the different features on a camera. I went completely through the manual and tried all the different setting adjustments, but couldn't notice any difference to the pictures it took, regardless of the adjustments I made. I hope this was just a lemon, but I doubt it. The camera seemed to operate just fine. I returned it and have ordered a different model to try.

Evans", "ReviewID": "R3R2PV4I8M4GLL", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "After doing much research and wanting to upgrade from my Panasonic TZ5 (10x Optical), I decided to try the Pentax for the greater zoom range...boy what a disappointment!  Having owned several Digital Point and Shoots, this has to be the worst I have tried. I would normally try the camera before reading the manual, then read the manual to see what I may be missing. With this one though, I promptly read the entire manual while the battery was charging.I was hoping to be able to get decent photos using both preset settings and my own, unfortunately after taking over 1000 photos - only a handful came out as \"keepers\". For the most part even up close birds came out blurred regardless of using the preset or my own settings. No matter what I tried I could not get this thing to focus correctly.Another big draw back was the resolution of the LED screen, it would flash for a second to show a clear image, then go back to fuzz - it was hit or miss when you pressed the shutter button and most were misses. The screen never stayed focused on your subject even though the camera's little green boxes tried to say you were in focus, you couldn't tell using the LED or the Viewfinder as both stayed fuzzy at all times.The few shots I did get that came out not blurry - the colors are washed out compared to my TZ5. As for using the zoom - if you plan on zooming in on inanimate objects such as buildings - it worked ok. If you plan on zooming in anything that may sway a bit, or breath - forget it - all photos are fuzzed or extremely soft around the edges. I get much clearer shots at the same distance away using only my 10x optical on the TZ5.Surprisingly enough the best set of images I got, I took while holding my camera out the truck window and not looking at the LED screen or viewfinder at all.I took this camera with me on a fishing trip with some friends we had not seen in a while - after about 30 minutes of being frustrated and not getting any images worth keeping, this camera got put away and I pulled out my old trusty TZ5. My friends were amazed at the photos it took, while they just shook their heads at the Pentax photos.If you are into photographing bugs, flowers, and anything else up real close (Macros) this camera maybe what you want, as I did note the best images were those using Macro and Super Macro settings... one plus amongst the all other minuses.I have packaged this one up, and have ordered the Panasonic DMC TZ35.Summary:Pros -Awesome MacrosCons- slow to focus (if you can get it to focus)LED stays fuzzy after only a short flash of a clear image on the screen (couldn't tell whether you are really focused or not - had to try and rely on the camera's green boxes and beep- which wasn't reliable either)Zoom causes much blur and softness to anything that may move in the slightestLens cap falls off very easilyI should have listened to the one other reviewer here that also sent theirs back.
