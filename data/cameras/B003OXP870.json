{"Reviews": [{"Title": "It's okay but not very reliable", "Author": "VC Geezer", "ReviewID": "R1ZNKAIKC0QS1X", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "I purchased this a few days ago as a low-cost business card sized pocket camera and it fills the bill. The nice menu system and built-in help are a big plus. It uses the same menu sustem as most of the other Olympus cameras. The only real negative I have with this camera is that the images are a bit fuzzy, especially if you look at them at full size and especially around the edges, but for under $100 you can't expect to have super optics. If you don't like that, get the Olympus SP-800UZ with superior optics but it will cost nearly 3X as much and will not fit in your pocket.Update: 12/16/2011I just encountered a problem with this camera where the LCD display has partially failed. It now has two dead areas in it (black), one which is over part of the menu making it hard to read. This was not due to rough handling, either. I think I'm going to toss it.  I have downgraded this camera from a 4 to 3 star since I feel that this camera should have lasted a lot longer than 9-10 months.", "Date": "March 8, 2011"}, {"Title": "Not a great camera", "Author": "Liz Loma", "ReviewID": "RPX9QN14Z3MDI", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "This camera gets 2 stars because it is capable of taking decent photos. However, within 3 weeks of owning and using the camera, some of the pixels on the LCD screen started to die. It doesn't affect the photos themselves, but there is now a nickel sized black spot on the LCD screen, which makes it hard to see the subject for which you want to take a picture. Also, the flash is in a terrible spot. My almost 5 year old can use our Nikon camera with no problems, but his finger always covers the flash on this camera. MY finger covers the flash about a third of the time. I have to make a conscious effort to keep my hand/fingers lower than the flash, or I get a weirdly lit picture. Choosing which mode to take a picture in is also annoying. You have to go through the LCD screen choices, so trying to quickly get the right setting to take a picture of something that won't be there long is not very easy. I think I'll stick with Nikon or Canon from now on since they're well known for having great cameras and being used by professionals. Had my last Nikon for 5 years and only had problems with it after having said 5 year old drop it many times.UPDATE: Just over a year after purchasing this camera (two months out of warranty) we were on vacation and I plugged it into my laptop with the USB cord to download pictures and the camera just died. It wouldn't turn on, wouldn't charge, wouldn't connect to the computer. Nothing. Totally hosed. Very disappointing!", "Date": "October 12, 2010"}, {"Title": "Great Pics. Simple to use.

It is really easy to use and change modes. It is lightweight and a perfect camera for most scenarios.I use it for vacations, for Ebay, for work, etc.It is hardy, battery life is very, very long. I do not have one negative thing to say.It also takes very decent video clips!", "Date": "November 16, 2011"}, {"Title": "Spend  extra for a better camera -Don't believe the sellers description about how great the quality is!", "Author": "Honest Jeff", "ReviewID": "R1E47UHJ0VUEQF", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "The camera is very nice with the screen options and the size is very nice. The picture quality is not very nice though.The lens is very small and the picture edges are not clear. Sort of like an old cheap film camera. I have three other digitalcameras in the household which all have way, way, way better quality including video - but I won't mention the manufacturers because I am not promoting any specific model. This camera has very poor video quality. ( It could even be refurbished or damaged -How would I know?)Even though the sellers description of the camera makes it sound like your getting more fore your money. Personally, I would like to sendit back for a refund or exchange, but don't want to waste the time! From now on I will shop at a local chain store ( You get the Ads in the local news paper on Sunday morning) which has a return or exchange policy. Then if I'm not satisfied I can return it even the same day if I'm not satisfied!.Hope this was helpfulHonest Jeff", "Date": "July 24, 2011"}, {"Title": "Gift well received", "Author": "Douglas E.

It's light, has a great reputation brand-wise--but was disappointed when I started using it. The videos are great; captures sounds fantastically--but pictures are blurry and adjusting settings to match with lighting so all is not too bright or too dark is difficult. I haven't been using it much since I don't have time to fiddle around with the buttons to find a decent setting.Charging is easy; just plug camera in the cord and then charge with the wall charger that comes in the box. However, one little thing that I've discovered is that when you upload the pictures onto a computer, the quality of it is alot better than when viewing on screen. But, for me, that doesn't make up for how hard it is to set the features correctly so that pictures aren't too red or dull (this is my first camera ever--all these functions are too much for me to handle). Overall, this is an okay camera, but I do wish Santa would've picked a different camera to put under the tree last Christmas.", "Date": "May 14, 2011"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": null, "Features": null, "Name": null, "ImgURL": null, "ProductID": "B003OXP870"}}
