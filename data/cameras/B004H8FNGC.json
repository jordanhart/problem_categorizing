Updated rating from 3 stars to 4 starsI'm an underwater and rugged camera junkie so when I heard about this new camera I had very high expectations. I have owned 2 other Panasonic TS1 waterproof cameras and loved those (other than my last one leaked and destroyed the camera. Thank goodness for Squaretrade)I'm not a Sony 'fanboy' and never have been but have had a few good experiences in the past with quality of build and ease of use with their products so I thought i would part ways with Panasonic and try out the TX10. On paper... this camera seemed like it was the PERFECT underwater/outdoor camera. I loved the fact that you could slip it in your pocket and take it anywhere due to its size and it looks right at home even in a fancy restaurant. I spent a week snorkeling, hiking, and adventuring in Kauai so that served as my first chance to do an in depth review for what this camera was made for: the outdoors... and I wasn't too impressed with real-world usage. The photos and videos were great for such a small point and shoot but the practicality was lacking on multiple fronts to make this the \"PERFECT\" outdoor camera. However, there are a lot of things I truly appreciate about this little camera. In classic Pro/Con style, here are my overall thoughts and feelings on the Sony TX10.Pros:-Small and compact. Sexy. Take it anywhere. Looks right at home on the beach or in a fancy restaurant.-Touch screen is \"cool\". I would love this screen on non-waterproof casual camera... BUT... its also a con, see below-Cool, useless features like smile detection (takes the picture automatically when you smile) and 3D... haven't used 3D. Like I said, Fun, but useless.-Slide cover to protect lens when closed... BUT again, also a con. See below-Screen display resolution is awesome-Takes 1080i videos at 60 frames per second vs 30 frames per second that most point and shoots utilize. This provides \"lifelike\" motion. I love it and it looks great on my 55\" TV-Great wide angle lens 25mm-Picture and Photo quality were great... however video seemed to struggle at times to focus correctly.-I really like the sweep panorama mode. Very cool pictures and they seem well done and rather seamless. You can take \"High Res\" panoramas that are up to 43 Megapixels! (UPDATE: This has become-The waterproofing seemed pretty solid. I never found any drops of water in the housing or fog in the lens.Cons:-Due to the fact that the video is 1080i (interlacing), videos tend to have lines when played back in media players such as VLC on Mac and PC.(UPDATE: It is the Media Player's fault - I stuck the SD card in my Panasonic Blu-Ray player that can play AVCHD off of SD Cards and the 1080 60i videos taken by the camera look amazing.)-This was a big one. The startup to photo time is so SLOW (5-7 seconds) and taking a video is 5 seconds on top of that. By time you press record to take movies it takes at least 5-7 seconds to start taking the movie. So annoying. This is incredibly slow compared to the Panasonic TS1s I owned. (UPDATE: Still annoying.)-This is speculation here but The small and sleek form factor seems like if I dropped it it would get scuffed up really bad or might break. Doesn't seem rugged at all. (UPDATE: The black model of this camera will show nicks pretty easily... seems like it only has a very thin back coatings on it.)-The screen was easily scratched by keys or other things in pocket (screen protector!)-The touch screen is accurate about 80% of the time. Its finicky and sometimes inaccurate. Some things need to be tapped 2-3 times to register. It cannot be used while underwater if you want to change settings. Huge CON. Tactile buttons are key if you are going to be using a camera underwater or in the snow with gloves on.-The shutter button is way too sensitive for me. if you accidentally even graze it it will take you out of viewing mode... The full shutter release is most camera's sensitivity for a half-press to focus.-I don't know if it was the unit I had or not but the white background noise in those videos is pretty bad. I tried it in multiple settings, completely dry and it was always there. You can't really tell on the playback on the camera itself but once played in any media player, it's overwhelming. If i get an exchange unit, I will update this to see whether or not it was a bad mic. (UPDATE: It was a bad mic. I got a new unit and the audio is fine on it)-The slide cover is kind of inconvenient to get down. The front is so smooth and the edges so thin, its sometimes a little clumsy to get it down, also, some dirt got caught between the slide and the front of the camera and it made some fine scratches when opening and closing the camera.)-I'm worried that sand or dirt are going to get lodged in the hinges of the slide cover and jam it or make it grind. I've heard its usually not a problem, but stil... (UPDATE: dirt and sand got in the hinges and you could hear it grind while it was in there. After I got back from my trip to Southern Utah a quick freshwater rinse in the sink seemed to bring it back to normal)-The slide cover holds water after the camera is dry...-Battery life is not very good at all and I don't like that you have to plug it in to charge it rather than having its separate charger. I like to have 2 batteries and charge one while I take the other to use. (UPDATE: I bought the SONY battery charger for this and the aftermarket generic battery from eForcity here on Amazon. The aftermarket battery actually has a better life than the Sony battery. Sony battery: 630mah, aftermarket: 900mah. I would recommend it)So there you have it. I love the form factor, but for a rugged outdoor camera I would prefer a more solid build like the Panasonic TS3. Great form factor for everyday around the town use. The biggest concerns I have that will probably lead to me returning the camera are the touch screen and non-rugged build. The videos and pictures are amazing so when it comes down to it, that is what matters most. If you want a waterproof camera to protect from a spill or just a fun day at the pool then this might be the one for you. If you are going to use this camera on the snow, on the beach, snorkeling, hiking, climbing etc... just be careful with it or I would probably look more into a more rugged camera like the Panasonic TS3 or Olympus TG Tough Series. They all take great pictures and videos in my opinion. Would I recommend this camera? Yes.", "Date": "May 31, 2011"}, {"Title": "Really good camera, but not perfect.", "Author": "CordlessTaco \"S\"", "ReviewID": "RYX2NJLMKDKLH", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I was in the market for a new digital camera since the old one I had broke because I left it in the hot sun in my car all day. The main reasons I chose this Sony Cyber shot TX10 is because first It appears to be more durable(for weather extremes, water, and a low level drop).  Secondly, it was always annoying to me that when I went to sporting events or really any type of event, I had to choose between either taking a video or a still picture, and then had to stop and take a few seconds to change modes if I needed to hurry and do the opposite. With this camera, you can do both at the same time. there are two separate buttons on top(one is the video record button, and the other the still picture shutter button). So as your taking video, you can press the shutter button and take still images without interrupting your video recording. How cool is that?  Now, while I'm on the subject of Video, there is a little annoying downside. You have to decide ahead of time if you want to record in the highest definition AVCHD for playback on your HDTV, or MP4 for playback and editing on your computer and uploading to youtube. Now if you do chose MP4, you can play that on your HDTV, but it's not as high of quality video as if you chose AVCHD.I do own a 3DTV, so being able to take some 3D still pictures for playback on my 3D was another selling point. I'll start with the panoramic 3D shots. These give a very cool 3D effect on your 3D TV. If you've ever seen those pictures that kind of move with you as you walk from one side of the picture to the other, it's kind of like that. As for the non-panoramic still 3D pictures, that mode is pretty pointless. I tried several different shots including sticking my finger right at the camera, and the best you get playing it back on your 3D TV is a very very slight background depth. So I'd recommend sticking with the panoramic 3D mode for all your 3D picture taking needs.In terms of picture quality, the pictures and HD videos are very clear and great for viewing on an HDTV or for printing out pictures. The Audio recording for the video is absolutely top notch. It's probably the highest quality audio I've ever heard that didn't come from a peripheral microphone.Battery life is so so, but not bad. If your going to do a lot of video recording I'd recommend buying a second battery. Straight video recording with no breaks will give you about an hour of use. Although, I've never personally done more than a few minutes per video I've taken. The instructions indicate that you can only do a maximum of a 29min shot of video, then you have to stop and start a different video record file. Using it just for still photography without a lot of screen playback will get you about 2 hours use.  I generally use a mix of both and after about an hour and 20 minutes of straight use I had about 1/4 left of my battery.As someone else mentioned in a review, in bright sunlight it is difficult to see the view screen and to choose modes and options. That was a little annoying, but not really that big of a deal to me. I could do my mode changes in the shade or squint for a few seconds and just point and shoot in the bright sun. The camera adjusts so well, I really didn't worry about a shot being blurry. The pictures in high sun light areas come out beautifully. The flash does a great job in totally dark areas as well.The touchscreen is not as responsive as an Ipad or Ipod touch, but then again you don't want it too sensitive and accidently touch the screen as our taking pictures or video, so it does it's job well enough.I don't plan on taking this camera underwater, but there are plenty of YouTube videos of people showing test videos of their experiences, and they all look pretty darn good. You do have to be careful if you do take it underwater, and the instructions do list precautions about making sure no sand or hair is on the battery compartment gasket, so that it doesn't leak. Also, you must soak the camera in plain fresh water for about 5 minutes after putting it in salt, or chlorinated water. As well as dry it well before opening any compartment.There is a \"?\" option that you can push on the touch screen that is like a digital version of the instruction booklet. It lets you do search for questions as well as if you don't know what a function is, press the \"?\" and it will tell you.Overall, I really like this camera. There are a lot of functions and quality in this little tiny camera that can easily fit in your pocket. Like I said, it's not perfect but no camera is.  The ability to take video and stills simultaneously without mode changing is so so nice. I give this camera my recommendation.", "Date": "May 6, 2011"}, {"Title": "NOT WATERPROOF AT ALL!!!!!", "Author": "Ricardo lirani bassanezi", "ReviewID": "R2RE5NG9T3AY2K", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "Well,I'm totally disapointed with Sony because of this camera.I have just used it for 2 weeks then it died. First time using the camera under water, after few minutes, it stopped working, the screem got crazy and it never turn on again. I have burned 300 bucks on nothing! I have followed all procedures, stayed in a place with less than 2 meters deep, only about 15 minutes after, the camera sttoped and never work anymore. I'm an old user of Olympus Stillus camera, and I love that, it still working for more than 4 years.After chating with Sony specialists they told me to send it to Laredo Repair Center in Texas,I'm in Brazil, so I expent U$40 to send the camera to the repair center and guess what, to fix the camera they charged me U$ 576!!!!! It's under warranty, I just used the camera as the specifications described in the manual and it get stuck, do not work anymore. That's the worst product I ever have with the worst support.My equipment still at Laredo Repair Center, I hope sony can solve this problem ASAP!!!!The support is awfull, customer suport and Laredo is even worst. I have wrotten a letter describing the problem, how it was used, everything in details and it looks like nobody read it. They just put the status at internet, to fix, it custs U$576!!!!! Call support to approve it. I have paid U$270 in the camera, its more than twice to get it fixed!! I called them and they told me many technical stuff and that simply the camera cannot be fixed. I have asked for a formal email about the problem and what cause it and they cannot send it!!!! Its awfull, please do not buy this unit, when you look at it, its beatyfull, looks like a good device, however, its totally disapointing, only if you need to burn 300 bucks, its better if you get a ligther and burn it, less headache you have.I have tryied to contact the Customer Center to open a complaim and they do not have a way to contact the Laredo Repair Center, how is this possible? I have called more than 6 times to convince an attendant that It's under warranty . They will try to contact Laredo repair Center however until now, I still waitingI will not recomend this camera neither for the worst enemy in the world.

I was nervous we might be one of those rare negative reviews where the water broke the camera immedietly but are happy to say we used it all over Hawaii, man-handled the poor thing, dropped on lava, used snorkeling multiple times a day, used by the volcano, at the beach, etc.  It held up perfectly and was so easy to use.  The pictures and video are AMAZING - crystal clear.  I was very impressed with the underwater pictures and video - very clear, as good as real life - only trick is that you can always tell exactly what you are shooting until you get used to it.  Also did a lot of panorama both underwater and out - agian - seamless, beautiful and clear.  I could make postcards with these pics!  I was also super impressed with the lowlight pictures, every camera I have owned, even the more expensive ones, have had trouble with lowlight or background light - not this camera, they are perfect.  Also took amazing sunset photos with the twighlight/portrait setting, just gorgeous.  Took amazing high def videos at the Luau of thte dancers and fire - incredible.  I am SO PLEASED, this is the best camera I have every owned.  I love sony cameras and this one was above and beyond, I have much more to try with the face/kid/recognition settings.  They sure pack alot into a little camera. It is lightweight, fits in the palm of my small hand and is very sturdy/durable.  We used the jellyfish ball/float that came free with it when we were in the water, worked great.  We always rinsed in fresh water at the end of each day and never opened anything on the camera until it was dry. I though battery life was fine, better than my old sony. I bought an extra and the external charger, so cheap, didn't really need them but was nice to have just in case.  The videos are great but the high def means they can't usually be emailed like I'm used to.  Oh - also really like the software that came with the camera, love how it organizes everything and you just click on the day you want.

I was looking for a waterproof camera for my trip to Caribbean when I read about Sony TX-10. I compared the reviews and specs of canon D10, panasonic TS1,2 and 3, Olympus, pentax and most other waterproofs out there. After comparing several professional reviews and pondering over the best overall package ie best image quality combined with other features, I bought this camera. I can say that it was an excellent choice. It lived up to its claims of being waterproof as well as rendered excellent image quality. The auto plus mode is awesome. Could not believe that a point and shoot takes such good low light photos. It is so slim and handy that it will fit into any pocket easily. In the Caribbean, I used it in the pool as well as for snorkeling trips.Cons:-The video does take around 5 sec to initiate, but that did not prove to be any major problem for me. The video quality in fact is superb.-The touch screen is less responsive when wet, but thats not to say that you cannot operate it all when it is wet. underwater however, touch screen feature does not work. So set your underwater mode before you begin your snorkeling.-Battery life is decent but nothing to showcase, when compared to some other point and shoots. However that's not a deal breaker for me.

Ajitsaria", "ReviewID": "RDTA7PPXW0UNR", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "After researching all sorts of cameras for the past 3 months, I finally splurged on this one over a month back -- even though there weren't many reviews on this then. I was replacing an excellent Sony DSC-V1 that I had bought in 2003 (which finally gave up the ghost). I just got back from Yosemite where I stress-tested this baby.The positives: It does best what it is supposed to do - take beautiful pictures. It is a true point and shoot and manages all complex heavy lifting behind the scenes. I took several pictures of the sunset reflecting on the Half-Dome and the camera caught all the subtle light changes ranging from white to dark gold over a period of an hour. Other pictures caught the subtlety of the colors of that lush valley. And I used the lowest available resolution most of the time. Not a single blurred image. The camera is extremely light. It is smaller but slightly thicker than my iPhone. It comes loaded with features, most of which I haven't used. I did use the panoramic mode and can report that it is great. I took it inside several waterfalls, confident because it is waterproof, and those pictures were more realistic than what a naked eye could see. (I haven't dropped this camera yet so can't comment on the shock-proof). The zoom is excellent. The non-protruding lens gives it a nice form factor. The battery life is not bad - I took a couple of hundred pictures while constantly turning it on and off - on a single charge. The menu options, although a million of them, is fairly easy to understand.The negatives: Because the lens is on the upper left side, the photographer's finger(s) will occasionally be in the picture. This is just bad design -- Sony should have moved the lens to the upper middle or center. And because the camera is so small, you have to hold it quite awkwardly to prevent the lens from getting covered with your fingers. This leads me to my second gripe: the camera is not very ergonomically designed - it is just difficult to hold when taking a picture. Beware if you have fat fingers. The screen is very touchy -- it will go into some mode-changing mode at the slightest touch. This happens at annoyingly regular intervals. Remember, the screen occupies almost 100% of the real estate in the back to it is easy to trigger accidental changes. Fortunately, the camera makes you confirm before it commits any changes. Ironically, the screen is not very responsive to the touch otherwise -- but as an iPhone user, I am spoiled. It can be quite annoying nevertheless. I constantly find myself using the (very) few actual buttons they have and wishing they had put more. Also, a nitpick: the wrist strap is extremely difficult to attach to the camera.Misc.: Get a second battery. I also bought an additional battery charger. The camera doesn't ship with ANY memory, so make sure to buy some. The screen is a finger-print magnet, use a screen protector. I fashioned one from an iPhone screen protector and it works great. You will also need a mini-HDMI to HDMI cable if your TV doesn't support mini-HDMI.Overall, I give it four stars primarily because of the quality of pictures it takes.", "Date": "June 17, 2011"}, {"Title": "Great Smart Pocket Size High Quality Camera", "Author": "R.

The 3-D mode was nothing special but all other photography came out great.  High speed photos were clear, you can even see the drops of water falling from the splashes.

However, after I used it for a couple of months, and, got used to its features, I decided that five stars was more appropriate.My first \"point and shoot\" is an ancient SONY DSC T33 (5.1 Mp) Sony Cybershot DSCT33 5.1MP Digital Camera with 3x Optical Zoom (Includes Docking Station) I bought about five years ago.  It is a little beat up, but, it has worked really well, and, continues to work really well.  I love it.  I wouldn't have bought a new camera except I misplaced it for a few months and needed a new one.This camera DSC-TX10, provides three times the resolution, and I am really happy with the higher resolution.  It's hard to take a bad picture because, with the high resolution, you can electronically crop most photos into award-winning pictures, and the remaining cropped image still has plenty of resolution.This is a camera you can stick in your pocket, and, take with you, all the time.  It is compact, lightweight, sturdy enough to take jolts, bumps and an occasional fall.  You can keep it in \"easy mode\" for almost instant \"point and shoots\", and, it will stay in easy mode until you exit into the more complicated functions.  I cherish the simplicity.  I have 22 years of education, and, many years of technical experience.  I am no \"technophobe\".

I didn't have time to play with it or read the manual before my trip. I launched straight into using it. Here are some of my favorite things:1. It didn't leak, and there are no bubbles on the lens when the door opens.2. It's very intuitive. The menus on the screen make sense if you just take your time. However, it's hard to change your menu settings underwater, so remember to shift to underwater setting BEFORE you get out in the water snorkeling.3. There's a built-in image stabilizer that made the video I shot as we drove down a bumpy beach road incredibly smooth. It virtually eliminates the shakiness I've seen in videos with every other camera I've owned. It's wonderful. I was on a boat that was jostling up and down as a cold front and huge waves moved in, trying to grab a few sunset shots. I assumed they would be blurry, given how much the boat was moving, but they were PERFECT.4. It's tiny, and it fits in your pocket.5. The 16mp image quality is BEAUTIFUL.6. The price was reasonable.The only minor downsides are the touch screen, if you're not used to that kind of thing or have big fingers, and the short battery life. If you shoot all day long, you'll run out of juice by nighttime. But I did what others suggested in their reviews and bought the Wasabi battery pack, and i just kept a battery charged at all times. That, too, was a great little bargain.My last waterproof camera was an Olympus Tough, but I far prefer this one.

Finally a camera that shoots like an SLR but fits in my pocket.  I'd read lots of reviews about this camera and wanted to put to rest some of them.First, the start-up time.  I've read some reviews where people were complaining about lengthy start up time.  That is not standard and they need to replace their camera.  I've used two of these (my friend had one and I bought one for myself), and both started immediately upon sliding the lens cover down.  Couldn't be happier.Second, processing time.  Reviews I'd read complained about how long it took the pictures to process.  This was written by people that didn't understand what their camera was doing.  If you take a normal picture, then it processes immediately.  If you take HQ Panoramic photos, then it's taking up to 15 photos and stitching them together, or HDR shots which re-process the image to correct the backlight.  Depending on how you're shooting, it may take a moment or so to process, but nothing lengthy.Third, the Defocused Background shooting.  Besides the iSweep panorama shooting style, this is my next favorite as it can take SLR style background defocused shots.  It's a little touchy, as it won't always defocus, but I think that's because I just haven't gotten the hang of it yet.  Some shots turn out fantastic whereas others tell me it couldn't defocus.Fourth, the touch screen focus.  I love the ability to touch the screen where I want it to focus and have the camera do the rest.  Don't understand why people were having problems with this, as it works great!Fifth, the battery life.  I read some reviews where people were stating they were having substantial problems with their batteries draining quickly.  I went out and bought a two pack of off-brand N type batteries and a quick charge wall adapter for about $15 dollar total and now have three batteries for my camera.  However, I haven't had any problems with the battery life and ended up just giving one of my batteries away to my friend who had the same camera, since I don't think I'll ever use it.Other negative reviews included the iSweep and underwater shooting.  iSweep works amazingly.  I've been taking fantastic panorama shots the first day I got my camera and plan to frame some of them.  *Frame-worthy photos the first day of shooting is always a good sign*  As for the underwater shooting, I can't wait to get in the water and start shooting.

I own a Canon Powershot G9, which is a great camera, along with its waterproof housing, but I was looking for a camera that was much more discreet and less bulky.-The image quality of photos (NOT taken underwater) compared to my G9 is comparable, but is not quite as excellent.  Don't get me wrong, the pictures are still crystal clear! I would say I would rank it a 9 out of 10 compared to the image quality of my G9.-My G9 with the underwater housing would rank 5-6 out of 10 on image quality compared to a 9 out of 10 with this camera, which I am very pleased with. The underwater pictures (taken in the ocean) turned out relatively well, but need optimum amounts of sunlight and pretty pristine ocean to get great photos.  I live in hawaii, so pristine ocean isn't very hard to come by, but some days the water is dirtier than others, and that just so happened to be the only day I have tried my camera out.  However, photos taken in the pool were very very clear, so I have high hopes for the next ocean attempt.-I love the sleek design.  To tell you the truth, it doesn't feel like this camera could take a beating.  But, I haven't put that feature to the test yet.-The large LCD is nice.There are some things I don't really care for.  They are more annoying than actual problems.-The touch screen is very fussy when you're in the water.  (It must have difficulty recognizing your touch amidst the pressure of the water?)-The slide down cover is the front can be a little slippery and clumsy to get down.  But, it's not so bad.  I'd rather my lens be protected with a cover than none at all.-The flash settings are a little annoying.  You can't just manually force the flash to be on like my canon.-This camera also takes slightly longer to flash and has a very slight slower reaction time than my G9.

We do a lot of outdoors activities - hiking, kayaking, etc., so needed something small, durable & waterproof, but I didn't want to give up picture quality.  This camera fills all those reqs to a T.  When it comes to cameras, I'm a point & shoot person.  I don't know about white balance, shutter speed, etc. - I just want to point & click, so my review won't be as technical as others.We used it primarily for photos, not video, and had no troubles with battery life.  Just plugged it in every night and it was good to go.  Never got below 2 bars of power remaining.  The first day we took it rafting & kept it in a dry bag most of the time, but it handled the water just fine when we took swims in the river.  Next test was snorkeling in the Caribbean.  Wound up with amazing pics & lots of wonderful sights captured.  We followed others' recommendations to get a camera float strap, which was a great idea Olympus STRAP FLOAT ORANGE because the camera will sink without it.  Followed the directions to soak the camera for 5 min. in tap water to rinse out the salt water and sand and made sure never to open it when it was remotely wet.  Spent lots of time on the beach and in the water with it and never had troubles with reliability.  Took it hiking & zip lining in the jungle & it handled the humidity and jostling in our pockets & jolts from the harness just fine.Picture quality was great in all settings.  Very pleased with the interior shots -- we took lots of pics at dinner & in low light and the results were great.  The panorama setting worked like a charm, too.

I wanted a waterproof camera which would produce high-quality photos in all settings (indoor, outdoor, and underwater.  My intention was to completely replace my 7.2MP Sony DSC-W7, which I LOVE.  I wanted to add the underwater feature without compromising on other features.  I did not want to spend more than about $400 for everything (camera, two 8GB memory cards (Class 10), two extra batteries with charger, and float strap.  This left me with about $340 max to spend on the camera itself.  I do NOT know a lot about photography.  Terms like \"ISO\" and \"white balance\" are foreign to me.  I like to use pre-programmed scene modes and auto features.  I enjoy digital scrapbooking and I frequently zoom and crop.  It takes a very high quality photo to crop out/enlarge a small figure without too much distortion.I began my search online and spent about 6 hours researching the cameras in my price range.  The cameras I focused on most were the Canon D10, Sony TX10, Panasonic TS3 (sometimes referred to as FT3), Olympus TG-810, Olympus Tough 8010, Fujifilm XP30, and Pentax WG-1.I eliminated most of these options rather quickly based on their reviews, overall ratings, and the quality of photos that I reviewed.  I narrowed my focus to the Canon D10, the Sony TX10, and the Panasonic TS3.I wanted to love the Canon D10, since it seems to be the overwhelming fan favorite, but I ultimately decided that it wasn't going to be a good fit for me.  The price of the D10 is similar to the Sony and the Panasonic, but it's a 2.5 year old model which doesn't have HD video.  The photo quality seemed about equivalent to the other two, so I decided to only focus on the two models with HD video.I would have been completely sold on the Sony, since I've used only Sony cameras most of my adult life and I've never been disappointed in one; however, there were some notable deficiencies which most reviewers found with this model (detailed below), so I was a bit hesitant to take the plunge.  The Sony was also priced near the top of my budget ($329), whereas the Panasonic was only $275 at Amazon.com.  The Panasonic reviews seemed to all be very positive, with the only significantly commonly-noted problem being lower quality indoor photos.  However, all of the indoor, outdoor, and underwater photos that I reviewed online looked very good.I decided to take a chance on the Panasonic TS3 and I really, really, wanted to fall in love with it.  I ordered it from Amazon and they delivered it the next day.  I wasn't blown away by this camera.  The outdoor photos were good.  The video was very good.  The underwater photos (taken in my large fish tank) were very good.  The indoor photos were POOR.  I decided to order the Sony TX10, hoping that I'd see better results.  I ordered it from Amazon at 9pm that night and it was delivered at 1:00pm the next day (gotta love Amazon!).  The photo quality of the Sony camera is outstanding.  I'll be keeping the Sony TX10!!!  For some people, however, the Panasonic might be the better choice.First, I'll provide my overall recommendations, then I'll add in all of the detail:BUY THE SONY TX10 IF:You value the quality of the photos/video above all else.You like touch screen devices.You don't plan to dive lower than 16 feet.You don't care if you can't adjust your settings (other than zoom) underwater.You want a VERY small camera.You always use a wrist strap.BUY THE PANASONIC TS3 IF:You can live with grainy indoor photos.You don't typically enlarge your photos to 100% (because they will be distorted).You want a camera with GPS.You plan to dive deeper than 16 feet.You want a larger (but not too big) camera.You're looking for a less expensive option.NOW FOR MY DETAILED COMMENTS ON BOTH MODELS:PRICE - The Sony is +/- $50 more expensive than the Panasonic.SIZE - The Sony is significantly smaller and lighter than the Panasonic.  I don't think one is better than the other, per se.  It's a matter of personal preference.  The Sony will fit in most pockets.  The Panasonic probably wouldn't.RUGGEDNESS - Both cameras are rated very well in this area.  I haven't \"tested\" them, but it seems like the Panasonic is built a bit tougher and would be less likely to get destroyed in a fall.  Rather than test this feature, I'm going to just trust the experts that either one will hold up well if dropped.", "Date": "August 20, 2011"}, {"Title": "Excellent camera for parents on the go", "Author": "jpatters66", "ReviewID": "R1XUXIAM3VOQCJ", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "We also on a Cybershot DSCT90.

It has not been underwater but has been soaked in rain while visiting Asia and Italy. This camera has been dropped multiple times but still takes very good pics once you figure what settings to use and it takes incredible high resolution panorama pics.Preferred settings are:1. Wife: Keep it in \"Superior Auto\" (yellow camera icon) with the flash set on \"OFF\" for everything but backlit photos and nightime/twilight pics. with \"Face Detection ON\" and 95+% of the time, the pictures come out GREAT.2.

I can't tell you how useful this can be.+Photos are bright and colors are vibrant.+Extremely durable. I got caught in a desert storm in United Arab Emirates and the sand did not mess up my camera like it messed up my companions' cameras.+You can edit photos on the camera itself. By edit, I mean you can \"paint\" and make small changes to pictures.+Panorama mode is easy and spectacular. All you do is \"sweep\" your camera across. The downside to this is that the panoramas are not high resolution.+Camera body is VERY light and portable. You can't even feel it's there.+Instruction manual and \"Help\" features are right in the camera! No need to shuffle through an instruction booklet!+Easy mode is truly EASY!Some minuses that IMO do not really take away from the camera so much:-Touch screen isn't perfect. The sensitivity is on the low side and isn't accurate enough.-Deleting and zooming into photos can be slow.I haven't tried the waterproof capability as yet, especially after reading some reviews about water leaking into the body.

However after our trip to Hawaii, the camera performed very well.  We were actually amazed at all the different modes the camera had, and the touchscreen worked well above water.Normally when you buy a cheap waterproof camera (we paid $160 over thanksgiving), you sacrifice picture quality.  This camera does great pictures both underwater and above water.  We also love the ability to take widescreen photos, and great HD video with excellent frame rates.Battery life was good too, it will last you a full day, with a lot of pictures and video taking.  You will need to charge it at the end of the day.Having the camera as a charger is both its strength and weakness.  It will force you to buy an additional charger if you want to charge a secondary battery while you are out for the day.  However, it is also convenient having it as a charger esp with the USB cord as the charger.  This will make it easy for you to top up the battery when you are driving in your car.It is a little annoying to have to slide the front cover up and down to turn the camera on and off.  Its good in the way that it will protect the lens, and you wont worry about anything scratching it.  But it does get caught on stuff, and sand can get trapped between it and the camera.What's important to do with this and ALL waterproof cameras is to ensure that the rubber seals don't have any debris building up on it.

According to the Sony USA website, the TX10 is NOT on the list of compatible cameras and the live chat rep (Analyst_Sean) repeated that info back to me.

I have a 32gb card and there is no real need for 4800 pictures.
