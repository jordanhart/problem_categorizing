{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Great camera", "Author": "J. Dowden", "ReviewID": "R1TP5YOOW6WY1C", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "The DSC-T100 is a very good camera and I would highly recommend it. I have had several generations of the Cybershot series (DSC-T1, DSC-T9 and now the DSC-T100) and they've all been great, high quality cameras.This camera takes beautiful pictures. The pictures are clear, little to no white bleeding, with superb colors and great contrast. The lens is bigger than previous models so it works better in low light conditions and apparently this camera uses the noise reduction technology used in the new high end Sony cameras so the pictures should be less noisy when it's dark too.The movie quality is 640x480 at 30 frames per second with audio. And unlike the previous models you can zoom while recording movies (BIG plus!), whereas in the previous models you were locked at whatever zoom level you set before you began recording. Also, the movies are saved into MPG and not Quicktime so you're not locked into a video format.The camera is bigger than the previous top-end models, but not by much. I imagine they made the change to fit in the 5x optical zoom (over the previous 3x). And while they had the extra depth they threw in a 3 inch LCD (instead of 2.5) and a larger battery (to drive the larger LCD no doubt). I personally preferred the feel of the DSC-T9, but I accept the trading of features for a bit more size.The downsides to the camera are few and minor, and if I could I would have given this product a 4.5/5, but they don't let you do that. But, here are the problems I have with this camera.1. Reduced Buttons: From the previous models they removed buttons and replaced them with software driven menus. While I do not mind software menus, I do mind not having a choice between using the software menus and using physical buttons. They really should have included a button for delete and I really want a switch to pick between movie mode and picture mode. It takes a few extra seconds to switch from the previous models and I don't like that. Companies seem to think that it makes something easier to use if they make it software driven, but really it makes it harder and slower to use.2. Options Not Very Accessible: The software menus impose too many limitations. I should be able to cycle through all flash options with the flash button in auto mode, but I have to go into program auto mode to do it, and I have to use the software menus to do it. This camera has the ability to set a brighter flash or a dimmer flash, but it takes so long to change that I won't ever be able to use it. The same type of problem applies to the red eye reduction (although, I don't think it's necessary because it doesn't seem to have red eye problems since the flash is further away from the lens).3. The camera is still missing options that the DSC-T1 had. When I bought my DSC-T9 I remembered being so angry that they changed and removed options, and still they're missing. For example, you can cycle through different display levels (normal, normal with histogram, bright, etc.). On the DSC-T1 there was an option to turn off the backlight, which increased the battery time dramatically. But, you can't do this on the newer DSC-T9 or even the newest DSC-T100 models.4. It's a Sony so you pay a lot more for it. The camera is a reasonable price, but to make it useful you need to buy a Memory Stick Pro Duo, which costs a considerable amount more than SD cards (even though they are the same technology). You also may want the docking station, which is far overpriced, and all of the various other peripherals are more expensive then this should be also.Don't let the negatives discourage you though. This is a good product a Sony deserves praise for making it. I just wish they'd consult with me before they marketed it. :)", "Date": "April 23, 2007"}, {"Title": "Pricey but totally worth owning", "Author": "Gadgester \"No Time, No Money\"", "ReviewID": "R3I2FQYJAJW7R4", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I've had the T100 for just a few days (including a weekend of heavy shooting).  I love it.  Compared to similar offerings from Panasonic, Canon, Fuji, to name a few, it's expensive, but it has these following features that I find useful -- and they do work well in the real world:- Excellent picture quality: you buy a digital camera to shoot great-looking pictures, right? The T100 takes excellent pictures indoors and outdoors; like other Sony digicams, it's especially good at taking scenery photos- Face detection: automatically sets focus and exposure optimally for light-skinned faces in the picture; seems to work well in well-lit scenes- Optical image stabilization (\"SteadyShot\"): helps you steady slow-shutter shots; saves you about 1 f-stop; only Canon and Panasonic besides Sony use this kind of sophisiticated, non-digital technology- 5x optical zoom: the highest among ultra-slim digital cameras; zoom range is 35mm-175mm equivalent in a 35mm film camera- Zoom optically while shooting video: I'd been wanting this since the first day (over eight years ago) I got my first digital camera (a Fuji); yes, you can zoom the lens smoothly and *optically* (as opposed to digitally) while shooting in movie mode- 3\" super-bright LCD: the regular brightness level is pretty usable outdoors, but if you're shooting in bright sunlight, you can crank up the LCD brightness even further (at the expense of shortened battery life, of course)- Decent battery life: rated at 340 shots per charge by the Japanese CIPA standard; this translates into pretty good real-world battery life- Some manual controls available: EV compensation, etc.- Gorgeous design: and yes, I got this red version  :)So is this worth almost $400 for an 8-megapixel camera?  For me, the 5x zoom and optical image stabilization are must-have features (I'm nuts about shooting low-light photos without using the flash, unless I'm shooting with my Nikon D70 digital-SLR with sophisticated lighting setup that reproduces a natural-light look to the scene).Canon's and Panasonic's and Fujifilm's shoot excellent-quality pictures, too, but only the T100 has the right mix of image quality (and a great movie mode with zoom), standout styling and ease-of-use that make it a total best buy for me.Your comments and questions are welcome.", "Date": "June 25, 2007"}, {"Title": "Great Little Camera", "Author": "Bhavya K. Desai", "ReviewID": "R2MK6N915FKR6E", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "First of all I would like to say that I was very reluctant to buy a SONY camera. After doing a lot of research for my needs I ended up with Canon 800IS and Sony's new toy T100. Ofcourse canon has the best overall ratings for ever but I wanted a stylish looking camera for my needs. Sony T100 is the best looking camera I have seen. It's features are awesome compared to it's small size. You can take it everywhere. Big bright screen on the back clearly visible in bright sunlight. It takes good indoor pictures too. I tried to play with its settings for while and thought that camera was not good. But then the best feature of the camera made it a winner for me. The auto mode takes great pictures and no need to set anything. Sometimes changing auto ISO helped to reduce the graniness but to be very honest if you are not going to blow the image to larger sizes (which would be 99% of the time atleast for me) it won't make difference. Just Point and Shoot. You get a perfect image for viewing on computers. No complaints apart from optional docking station which costs about $80. 5x optical zoom is boon to me as 3x was merely zoom. Also zomming while taking movies makes this a small camcoder with 640x480 30fps shooting.It doesn't have touch screen like T50 and so it's responsiveness is better. I would like it bit faster though. Also camera takes pictures at very fast rate and the first picture you take is less than 2 secs.I would highly recommend this camera to anyone who can afford it.", "Date": "April 9, 2007"}, {"Title": "Attractive and easy to use. I wish the pictures were better.", "Author": "Yutai Albert Liao", "ReviewID": "R1AVYKWFAGN7EY", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "Pros:The camera looks and feels great in the hand. The solid metal casing, and the very satisfactory snap of the front sliding mechanism is very pleasing.I get frequent compliments and looks of envy when i pull this camera out, which to me, is a desired feature for any personal electronics i carry on my person everyday.The user interface design on sony cameras are generally very intuiative and well thought out. The 3\" screen is gorgeous and the buttons are very tactile and easy to reach and use.Cons:The camera captures OK pictures, but nothing to get excited about. It gets extremely noisy in indoor shots. by comparison, the Fuji F10 i bought perhaps 3 years ago easily out shone this camera in picture quality. In terms of a high ISO sensitivy camera (which this camera does boast, with sensitivity up to 3200iso and image stablization), i think i would whole heartedly recommend the much uglier and bigger Fuji F'series.Unlike the Sony T7 which I also own, I found this camera to be a lot slower in autofocusing when the flash is needed. In any indoor shot, i almost can never capture the shot i had want. I would pull out the camera, point it at my subject, and she/he might pose for me, and the camera would just flash the red focus light on them, for god knows how long, and the camera just won't snap any pictures. by the time the camera finally does take a picture, the moment is lost (up to 10-20 second) and the composition of the picture i had hoped for is no longer there. the upside i guess, is that i don't get too many \"posed\" photos from this camera cause people trying to pose usually assume they don't have to freeze in a fake smile for that long. by the time the camera flashes, they are generally surprised :PConclusion:Cute attractive camera might just be right for you. But i'd really recommand getting a few test shots in before you commit this much money to it.I am not dissatisfied enough with this camera to return it, but i probably won't buy it again if i had to do it over.", "Date": "May 16, 2007"}, {"Title": "Great all purpose camera", "Author": "E. P. Evans", "ReviewID": "R1PPIJMKI3ZU0T", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "The DSC-T100 is a great all round point and shoot with all the features expected of a camera in this class. The 5x optical zoom is nice given the non protruding lens, and allows for a very quick start up time in around a second.  Additionally the face detection is very good, once it locks on to subject/s it visually moves with them to keep the focus area of the frame always in the right place. It can be used with full auto settings or it gives access to manual controls, however I found auto to be very good in almost all situations. The pictures taken are very good quality although in low light the high iso does blur a little. The continuous shoot mode allows for almost 3 shots a second with out flash which is leaps ahead of the Casio I traded in for this.  The menu structure of the Sony is very intuitive and feels like a proper interface rather a bunch of options in a long list.All in all a very good, easy to use, high featured compact camera.

I have prepared a list of pros and cons for your camera-buying needs.PROS (There's a lot of them.):-The camera is sleek and stylish; it fits in your pocket and is great on-the-go.-The screen is HUGE!  3 inches!  Granted, it's not as big as the T200 touch-screen, but at least you don't get the screen all greasy with your fingers.-The picture is crystal-clear.  I've taken many pictures of my cat with it, and I could see every hair and every spot.  I could even see the small drops of water on her nose (now that's clear)!-Good automatic mode if you don't have time to dabble with the settings.-Many many many different picture settings.  There's one for outdoors, one for at night, one for high speed, and many more.-The macro mode is amazing!  When you're taking pictures close-up, the results are fantastic.  This camera even comes with super macro mode, which means you can shoot something with astounding clarity from less than one inch away.-If you're shooting a rapid action sequence, the burst mode is great.  It shoots continuously as the shutter button is held.-The start-up time is very fast.  When my cat starts to yawn, I have enough time to open the camera and take a picture before her yawn ends.-5x zoom is really all you need for everyday picture-taking.  It's super accurate as well and when you zoom, it flows instead of pausing after every zoom level.-The camera has a high-definition output and it takes pictures in high definition.  It also has a 16:9 picture mode so you can view pictures on a 16:9 television.-VIDEO! VIDEO! VIDEO!  The video quality is so good that this camera actually replaced my regular video camera.  Astoundingly clear video.  I've made several vacation home movies thanks to this amazing device.-If your pictures always come out blurry because your hands shake, this camera has SteadyShot.-The display comes with a power save mode (the led becomes darker) which saves you battery life.-The picture review response time is very fast, you don't have to wait long at all to see your picture.-FACE DETECTION!  Makes faces really clear.  I tried this out on a page of an old yearbook, and the camera detected the faces on the page!-Red-eye reduction is there, but that's a standard feature nowadays.CONS (It was very hard to find any.):-The button to view pictures is located at the top of the camera next to the power button, so if you have big fingers, you might accidentally press \"off\" when you want to review a picture.-Under fluorescent lighting, the pictures don't give off very natural colors, but they are still suitable for every-day purposes.-This camera doesn't have a viewfinder but only has a screen.  So for people that are used to looking through a viewfinder, it's quite a change.  You cannot turn the screen off, you can just dim it.-The SteadyShot feature doesn't work in auto mode.-You can't use flash on super macro mode.-The face detection is only for eight people, so if you take a lot of group photos with a large group, some faces might be blurry.I recommend this camera to anybody.  It's a great little device for the price.  It's worth every penny.", "Date": "October 6, 2007"}, {"Title": "Unbelievable pictures", "Author": "Stephen Fairley \"Law Firm Marketing Expert, B...", "ReviewID": "R1AHXH2M6IRAQE", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I just bought this camera (my 3rd digital) to take with me to Alaska for 2 weeks. Unbelievable! The pictures came out way better than I expected. Here's specifically what I liked most:1. rapid fire pictures--you know how when you are driving down the road at 70 mph and see a beautiful view in the distance and want to capture it? Well, this camera's multi-picture capabilities are outstanding. I took dozens of pictures out the front and side windows of the car traveling 70-100mph (I wasn't driving) and over 90% of them came out perfect with no blurring! My friends joked about how I would \"go paparazzi\" on the trip.2. User interface. After 2 weeks using this camera I know more about how to precisely set the exact setting I want (extremely adjustable) than I ever figured out with my last digital, a Canon, in over 2 yrs of using it. The interface is very user friendly. If you can use an iPod, you can figure this camera out.3. Full motion video. The video is fantastic. even full screen on my 21\" computer monitor the videos are clear and sharp. You can zoom in 5x when filming for close ups and distant settings with sound. Wow! My other camera pixelated a lot. This one has none of that unless you move the camera around too fast and then the images blur a little.4. Size is smaller than my wallet. This allowed me to feel comfortable just sticking it in my pocket and taking it everywhere. Its just slightly bigger than my Motorola Razr cell phone. When you take the camera everywhere you take a lot more pictures (over 1600 pics in 2 weeks on vacation--get a 4 meg memory card. Amazon has them for $50-$60, well worth it). The zoom is awesome and does not come out of the camera like most do. All the zoom is internal, even the 5x optical.I give this camera 7 stars out of 5!

I love the large LCD screen. The controls are easy to use.. the 'recall last picture button' on top by the power button is so convienient because everyone wants to see the pictures.  I'm still learning the little features of the camera, but you can point and shoot right out of the box.  I love that the camera has a 5x optical zoom and the lens stays inside the camera - amazing - the slide door protecting the lens after use is also nice and a feature of all the sony T series.  The movie mode is awesome - you can take as long a movie as you want - until you fill up your card or run out of battery - plus the sound quality on the recordings is great for such a small camera. I've found the battery holds it's charge very well.. bought a spare anyways.. using a 2G card so can take tons of pics.  It's definately not a SLR - but man.. takes great pics.. even mirco zoom pics.. I own a digital SLR for my photography habit - but this camera takes almost the same quality pictures - 8mp!  Crazy - do we need that many pixels?? (my digital SLR is only 6mp!!). I have better zoom and wide angles on the SLR, but I use this one to take everywhere - the digital SLR is too big to carry around all the time :) The camera makes cute sounds turning on/off (I haven't added music yet but you can!). Nice black and white and sepia modes.  You can play/edit the picture after you take it on the LCD screen.  So easy to use. Cute and sofisticated. Compact, but easy to hold.

Shin", "ReviewID": "R1YDEZ74PXR02L", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "1.  Just to let people know where I'm coming from:  *  I know a decent amount about photography and digital photography.  *  I respect and love Sony cameras: I've owned the F828, W1, V3 and R1, all of which took / take excellent  images.2.  I wanted a true subcompact camera, one that I could literally slip in my pocket, did a fair amount of research  and since I loved all of my other Sony cameras, I assumed that the T100 would be another great Sony camera.3.  So what are the problems I had with this camera?  *  This has been noted by many folks in the various forums--> indoor flash photos are... subpar.  Even with  tweaking the various settings, it's still subpar in my book.  Furthermore, another person made this very  good point--> this camera is a true point and shoot--> and thus one should expect excellent flash  photos without tweaking this and that.  The crazy thing is, even with all of the tweaking--> terrible  indoor flash shots.  *  Others have noted that the outdoor shots are fine--> I would disagree with this as well.  The my overall  impression (compared to my other Sony Cameras) is that the T100 outdoor shots are: a)  Less sharp  b)  Colors are... not as good (duller etc...)  c)  Overly contrasty (?) -- poor dynamic range.4.  Thus, as someone who is not biased at all against Sony cameras (quite the opposite), I found the T100 a  huge dissapointment.  The image quality and performance was so poor, I just couldn't believe that Sony  would put out such a product.", "Date": "May 5, 2007"}, {"Title": "Another great Sony camera!", "Author": "A. Galdi", "ReviewID": "R2HHEXJ29EBJYX", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This is the 4th Sony camera I've had and each time they keep getting better (which is why I've bought 4). This newest one, I got the red, is the best looking camera I've seen (and everyone agrees). However, I have a few qualms with it from my first uses. 1st they got rid of the review button on the left hand side of the t-pad and instead copied all the other camera makers and added a view button on top. While this works OK, I really miss being able to quickly go back to the last picture I took push the delete button and then take another, it's not a HUGE deal, but it just takes more time. 2nd is that the screen quality is not nearly as good as other Sony's I've had in the past. While it's GIANT which is nice, the pixels are fairly large and I feel that this lack of resolution makes the pictures look worse than they do when they get on the computer. The new face detection feature is pretty neat, though I haven't really been able to tell what difference it makes. Also I was a little upset by the high ISO setting, i tried using it at a club and not only was it so dark that the picture was useless, but it was also SOO grainy and blurry that nothing could be identified. I'll have to experiment with it more, but so far it was a bit of a let down. The steady shot works pretty well, I've only had a slight blur on one photo (which was expected as by hand got bumped) and all the others have been perfect which is quite welcome after my last camera without Steadyshot that blurred frequently. Another BIG DISAPPOINTMENT for me was that they got rid of the INFOLithium battery, I don't know if this is because of the issues they've been having, or just because this one lasted longer or what, but it's annoying to not have it say how many minutes I have left as I've gotten used to it for the past 3 cameras from them. Still it's not THAT big of a deal, just kind of annoying that they got rid of a feature. The 5x zoom is very good, and welcome over the measly 3x that the older versions had. The size and weight are really good (although it could be a bit slimmer as it's still almost an inch thick). Still it's smaller than my wallet and about as thick as my cell phone, so I can't really complain. All in all it's been a great purchase so far and I'm quite pleased, and will still be sticking with Sony in the future as this camera is so much better than my friends' Casios and Canons.", "Date": "April 20, 2007"}, {"Title": "A couple of fatal flaws", "Author": "Bob G.", "ReviewID": "RAEDPUMKN1SIY", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "I am submitting my review because there are two aspects of this camera that other reviewers either don't mention or gloss over and which I consider to be fatal flaws that a buyer will have to live with and always make excuses for.  One is the fact that it has a slow lens; the other is that there is no custom white balance.  I bought the Sony T100 camera for my wife because she liked the large screen, which allows her to show pictures to friends without everyone squinting at a small screen.  She has been using it now for about four months and we have taken over 4,000 pictures.  With regard to color balance, there are several presets for different lighting conditions.  Outdoor shots generally look very good, except that gray sidewalks are invariably tinted blue.  Indoor shots with average incandescent lighting are consistently tinted orange over the entire frame.  When coupled with the fact that the T100 has a slow lens (3/4 f-stop slower than, e.g., my Canon A640 point-and-shoot)these indoor shots are always noisy and grainy.  I am an ambient light person that dislikes flash and considering that so many pictures are taken in indoor settings such as living rooms and restaurants, the end result is always an orange grainy picture.  Our daughter-in-law just bought the new Sony T200 and we observed the very same results.  I compared their pictures with my Canon and the differences were startling, e.g, walls were white and clear as they should be - not dark and grainy orange.  Another thing that I dislike about this camera, and any Sony product for that matter, is their proprietary hardware.  There are no third-party batteries available for this camera, because as I understand, they put a microchip in the battery that will only allow their battery to be used.  Also, there is no provision for an external charger to be connected directly to the camera if your battery fails.  For my other digital cameras, I usually have a ready supply of two or three extra ready charged non-OEM battery sets.  The camera does take otherwise good pictures, but my point is that with a different camera, e.g., one that has a custom white balance feature and a faster lens, you can have it all.", "Date": "November 8, 2007"}, {"Title": "Unreal performance in a small package", "Author": "Bob \"Bob in Big Bear Ca\"", "ReviewID": "R2DGEJLLNCMTL1", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "My wife has an older Sony DSC-V3 and I had an older cybershot that I needed to replaced simply because of its age. So after reading several reviews I bought a Canon XXXX that was feature rich and a little less in cost but produced grainy noisy pictures. I returned the camera for a refund and later found that C-Net agreed with my observations concerning this particular camera. Reading further I found that the Sony DSC-T100 camera was the winner of C-Nets Editors Choice Award for compact digital cameras. So I bought one within a day or two of reading reviews from camera magazines and other sources.Now owning it for a little over a month I agree with C-Net's review to the letter.The camera fits nicely in a shirt pocket and with the sliding lens cover closed the lens is very well protected, and makes for a carry everywhere camera.The camera has a fairly simple to use menu system that gives you all of the standard features you would expect in a camera in this price range.The high ISO settings are remarkable, low light shooting is as good as any fast 35mm lens I've used. Color saturation and image clarity is as good or better than my wife's Sony DSC-V3.Plus the camera really does shoot 2.1 frames per second up to 100 and maybe a little over 100 frames per second (with the right memory stick).The high resolution movies are great and the audio in the movies is outstanding. Also movies improved with an image stabilization system that actually works. Plus the zoom is usable when taking movies up to the 5X optical range where the stabilization really comes in handy, along with the large 3\" LCD, which is great in all light, so it doesn't come with a view finder, but honstly who uses a view findr anymore on digital cameras.I really am very picky about photo quality or in this case image quality, and this camera with 8.1 mega-pixels and a Carl Zeiss 5X optical zoom Lens, makes images look very vivid and life like. If you use the vivid mode colors really get punchy, but that can make for some interesting shots too.The digital zoom or smart zoom is great, it still keeps the images very clear and is as usable as any digital zoom I've ever used.Then there's the Macro, there are two settings in macro. One is a great very usable macro that is good up to about 2 inches, then there's the close up macro that will allow you to shoot as close as 3/8th's of an inch from your subject. These images can be stunning and even though my last camera shot at about 1 inch from the subject, the colors tended to become dark, but since this camera has a great aperture the extreme close ups are beautiful.For such a small package this camera delivers more than you would believe.", "Date": "September 4, 2007"}, {"Title": "Very Pleased with my Purchase!", "Author": "C.

The tripod mount is also new and a mystery why the earlier ones did not have it.  The down side is that they took a really easy set of controls and screwed with them. The worst example is replacing a simple slide switch (Video-still-review-) with a special menu that requires multiple button pushes to make a change that should be one button easy.

Outdoors, it did a commendable job, handling most shots well. It also had a good movie recording mode and allowed zooming, while recording. It felt like I had a mini handicam with me, at all times, which was nice.The problems occured indoors and/or low light shots. The camera's flash isn't very strong. Skin tones especially, tended to look water color painted, if not close enough(within say 7ft or so). Also, the camera(in Auto mode) would raise the ISO, sometimes quite high, to compensate for it's weak flash, resulting in photos that were noisy. This was the problem. The indoor/low light shots were just too unpredictable. Yea, you could get around this by using Program mode and picking a specific ISO, and flash intensity(nice feature), for the situation, but that's not what a Point and Shoot camera should be. You should be able to throw it in auto mode and get consistently good results on most of your shots, which wasn't happening for me. Also, using Program mode, face detection was no longer available, if you are into that.All in all, I was disappointed with this camera, as a P&S; camera. It just required too much baby sitting, indoors and in lower light.

It's a wonderful camera. I'm not a professional photographer by any means. I found myself tired of lugging around a larger camera everytime we went on vacation (and found I didn't really use one much when we weren't on vacation). By not using my camera very often, of course, I forgot most of it's features. My pictures generally reflected that. I really wanted a camera I could have with me all the time and use more often.This Sony Cybershot fit the bill exactly!!! I ordered a small camera holder than I thread onto my belt. I carry my camera with me every day now. I've gotten so many pictures since I've been carrying it. It's so easy to just  open and start taking pics. It's ready instantly and takes TERRIFIC pictures. On top of that, I'm actually able to use features on the camera since I'm using it more often. I'm also taking video with it and finding it's very simple and takes great video.I suppose time will tell how well built it is by carrying it around with me every day. It feels very solid. Being a smaller camera, I'm having to learn where to place (or more appropriately NOT PLACE my hands) when taking pics. I've gotten my finger in the pic a time or two by not paying attention. But that's just a matter of getting used to it. I'm really looking forward while traveling not having to lug around a camera and all the necessary equipment with it. The battery has lasted wonderfully. It really does hold it's charge well (as advertised). I went ahead and bit the bullet and put a 4 gig stick in it to make sure and have plenty of room. It's amazing!!! I've taken many pics and lot's of video and still have a HUGE amount of space left on the stick. Wow!!! This is wonderful!!! I truly feel I made the right choice with this. I've taken pics in restaurants, rest stops on the interstate, the grave site of my dad, video at the beach, etc. This camera really does the trick.

Absolutely horrible! Most of the outdoor ones were OK. I kept thinking that I must just not have things on the right settings. I kept trying different settings and read the manual over and over.

Wong", "ReviewID": "R2KMEHVSB79AJD", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I will start by saying that this camera looks great. My mom bought it in a red and is good at deceiving people into thinking that it is a good camera. The 3\" LCD, all metal frame and sliding lens cover help with this too. But frankly, I cannot stand this camera because it won't do what I want it to do, and that is to just take some decent pictures.I would like to say that this is from my own experience, and that it's possible that I just got a lemon, but seeing as how there are definitely some other negative reviews regarding the camera's picture quality, I write this as a fair warning to those planning on buying this.To start, one of the first things I noticed was the awkwardness of the menu system. There's a menu button, and then there's a home button, both of which open some sort of menu. My mom let me borrow this for a half year trip to China because the old Sony P10 broke on me, and I was a bit shocked at the difficulty I had in trying to find where I had to go to change settings or even shooting modes. Add to that the fact that there is a noticeable latency when navigating the menu, ie. a lag time between pressing buttons and having the actual menu respond to it. It's not a full second or anything crippling, but it's slow enough to be annoying.What IS crippling, however, is the fact that my camera takes grainy pictures basically 100% of the time. Even well-lit outdoor photos end up looking very soft with poorly defined lines; and that's as best as it gets. When you move indoor or into a low light environment you will have an amazingly hard time taking a normal picture. If you want to drop the ISO to increase light exposure, the camera takes forever to capture the image. Even at ISO200, I notice that the camera may sit on the \"capturing...\" screen for a second or more. This causes over-exposure and the image becomes very blurry. If you increase the ISO past 800, you will get so much noise that you will just never get straight lines. As for the anti-blur stabilizer function...I'm not sure it actually works for me. While I don't claim to have surgeons' hands, I'm also not super shaky. Whether I run the camera on auto mode or play with the camera settings, I find it very hard to get a decent shot outdoors and near impossible to get what I would consider a \"good\" shot indoors.Here is the bottomline: The camera combines soft lines with blurriness to capture pictures that I am ashamed of. I feel that I need to apologize every single time I send any pictures to my friends. The amazing thing is that the Sony P10 which is at least 5 years old and could take pictures up to 3.2 megapixels in resolution consistently shot sharper images than this one (though it goes up to 8 megapixels...guess it doesn't mean anything in the end). I was actually satisfied with many many of the pictures I had taken with the old camera, but cannot stop complaining about this one. Sure the P10 was ugly and had a tiny screen, but I was sad to see it go and even more disheartened that my temporary replacement was this piece of garbage.Would love to hear from people who actually have good results with this camera though.

Even recommended to a friend to purchase one for herself. Small, nice battery life, great photos. Loved it. Would give it a 5 star for the first 2 years.Then in June 2009, the camera started to vibrate when turned on and the lens wouldn't focus properly. Went to Sony website, and they charge $141 plus tax to repair this. While digging on there, I found that they recognized this manufacturing issue on the DSC-T20 and are replacing T20s with the problem, but no other models. That doesn't help me. I now have a vibrating camera that won't focus and no way of fixing it that won't cost almost as much as purchasing a whole new one.

My reasons for leaving the Nikon and Lumix SLRs home were two-fold: Bulk/weight and a desire to remain inconspicuous in a place where the pickpockets and sneak thieves are quite proficient, while having a camera with me at all times.I had the T100 with me in a safari shirt pocket, my principal interest being the interiors and organs and windows of the great cathedrals. Also, in a bit uf whimsy, decided to take a macro shot of all the wonderful meals we had.Cathedral interiors often involved using ISO 1,600 or 3,200 -- noisy, of course, but there's a lot of software to deal with that if it's bothersome (I don't really mind the effect) -- and some of the results were amazing. The little camera \"saw\" details and colors that were not perceptible to the human eye.Got hundreds of shots per battery charge -- never using flash -- and did not fill 2 4-gig cards in 2 weeks of shooting 1,000-plus exposures.Occasionally, with difficult subjects, like the outdoor bronze statuary at the Rodin Museum, I used the 3-exposure bracketing mode -- +1, -1 and spot on. The spot-on exposure almost always worked, but layering the three was useful for extending the range when desired.For the most part used auto WB, auto exposure, with no regrets.I kept reminding myself these were personal snapshots, and that the world did not need any more high-res images of Notre Dame ;-)The T100 was almost as fine a companion as my wife ;-)", "Date": "November 12, 2007"}, {"Title": "Does a great video also", "Author": "A.

Excellent colors under reasonably sufficient light either outdoors or in.CONS:1. Slower recovering time between shots.2. Slower start-up time, you'd easily miss your catch-the-moment shot.3. Lens protector sliding down takes two hands to operate.4. Zoom in/zoom out control not as handy to operate.5. It is not compatible with Windows Vista.6. When it's used in Windows XP, its software CD-ROM is not as smart and convenient.7. The camera's control menu is not easy to handle.8. There is no 1600x1200 image size. This size is an optimum size for 4x6 prints.9. No Date Stamp function. Sony decided to remove this popular function a couple years ago on T9.10. Heavier and thicker than the T200.11. Sony is more expensive as usual. It cost me $420 plus shipping.Conclusion: A Canon of equivalence would be a better alternative, if 5x zooming is not what you must have.", "Date": "February 5, 2008"}, {"Title": "love the camera", "Author": "C.

I purchased this as an upgrade from my Cybershot DSC-P9, which was a fairly good camera but had poor video resolution.  I wanted better resolution for taking pictures and video of my young children.The DSC-T100 is a victim of its own features.  It has lots of fancy logic for locating faces and getting just the right focus - but all of this takes time.  Quite often several seconds.  This amounts to lots of frustration pressing the shutter release button repeatedly and having nothing happen because the camera hasn't found its perfect shot yet.  By the time it does the moment is gone.  I have so many pictures of my kids walking out of frame because the camera was not quick and responsive enough to capture the moment.  This has led to so much frustration and so many lost moments.  Another source of delays is that that flash does not charge until you take the picture.  This means more pictures lost.Do not buy this camera if you intend to take pictures of small children, or anything else that moves.The USB cable is also a bad design with a rather delicate plug for inserting into the bottom of the camera.  I have had to be extremely careful when the camera is in USB mode to make sure the leads on that plug don't get damaged.The only positive points about this camera are the slim design and the large display.

I wish I could say it was a great buy. Unfortunately, that is not the case.Today marks the third time since April, 2008 (which is when I originally purchased the camera) that I am having to send the camera back to Sony for repairs. I've had problems with the display not working properly, flickering, not showing colors, or simply not working at all; the facial recognition has not worked since day one; and the battery has not held a decent charge since day one either. To top it all off, every time I send the camera in for repairs, I have to pay for the shipping -- if that's not a slap in the face, then I don't know what is.Now, for the period of time in between repairs that the camera has worked, it's had its good points and its bad points (more of the latter than the former).The good:The zoom on this camera is great, particularly the ability to zoom while filming (which from what I've heard isn't available on all cameras in this price range). Also, the continuous shutter works well and is really fast (there is no way to turn the flash on, however, which is a disappointment).The bad:Everything else. The pictures are simply terrible. I've adjusted the settings countless times, I've even set it on automatic to let the camera decide which settings are best; however, without fail, every time I plug the camera into the television to view the pictures, they look absolutely terrible. I've played old VHS tapes that have better quality than what this camera puts out. The same goes for the video quality.My sister purchased a Canon camera that has the same features as this Sony (minus the ability to zoom while taking a video) plus more freedom to edit the photos in the camera, but her camera cost one hundred dollars less than this one, AND it hasn't given her any problems whatsoever. All in all, this purchase was a major disappointment. I truly expected more out of Sony, and I also expected that a corporation as large and as rich as Sony would at least have the decency to pay for the shipping when a customer is sending in their faulty product for repairs. This is most certainly the last time I ever purchase a Sony product.", "Date": "December 21, 2008"}, {"Title": "Poor photo quality, other design issues...", "Author": "Phillip Roncoroni \"goodcowfilms.com\"", "ReviewID": "R30AZ2JRWB1CRT", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "I bought this to upgrade from a 5 megapixel CyberShot, which, over the course of three years had started to take degraded photos from dust getting inside the case and in the lens barrel. I took it apart once last year to clean it out, and it helped marginally, but then after taking it apart again prior to buying the DSC-T100, I managed to not reassemble it correctly, therefore breaking it.The DSC-T100 has an 8 megapixel sensor and apparently \"super steady shot.\" Neither of these things seem to matter though, because the camera took crap photos. What good is an 8 megapixel photo when, even shrunk down, it looks blurry and hazy? In addition, why didn't the \"super steady shot\" kick in to fix this? Even in standard daylight, albeit indoors, some photos would turn out blurry. This was unacceptable. Even my old Sony 3 megapixel CyberShot (prior to the 5 and then this model) took crisper pictures than this.Another big problem I had with this camera was its interface design. On my previous two CyberShots, there was a function wheel that you could slide between modes very quickly with. Okay, I'm in auto picture mode, and now I want to take a video. Let's slide the wheel.Here? Okay, let's hit the menu button, which brings up a stuipid PSP style interface, hit down twice to move to movie mode, and then click OK! Yeah, that's really a step forward in interface design.These two things essentially killed the camera for me, and I returned it to Amazon.On the plus side, I LOVE the movie modes on the Sony cameras, which is why this was my third CyberShot. 30fps, 640x480 standard MPEG looks great, and with the DSC-T100 they added the ability to zoom.Oh yeah, the camera is also prohibitively small. Now, I wouldn't say I have huge hands or anything, but holding the camera, I noticed that my hand would cover the lens a bit at times forcing me to reposition it. So the lens is placed awkwardly here.Stay away from the DSC-T100.My quest for a new Sony camera continues, because I already have a bunch of Memory Stick Pro media, and because I love the movie modes on these cameras.

The performance is very bad for these features.I've sent it back to SOny, then as far as I can see, my camera is in repair mode for a long time. I am so  remorseful that I could not buy any sony products. I hoped that Sony could change my camera, but they didn't . I don't know how long it will take their response.
