{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Good camera but with alot of setup", "Author": "Chad & Mandy Sterling", "ReviewID": "R20Y75RSLI8BIB", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "This is a really good camera and i am very happy with it but it does take a long time to get setup correctly and this gets difficult when you have to climb a ladder to access the menu on the cable. The daytime picture is great quality and night picture is good but not very sharp at any distance at all, its kind of cloudy but compared to my other 600tvl cameras but it is far better to see everything within the screen and the night vision distance is great. Overall this is a very good camera and i would definitly recommend but it is a little pricey and requires alot of time to setup perfect.", "Date": "April 3, 2013"}, {"Title": "Poor image quality", "Author": "AmazonConsumer10000", "ReviewID": "R2LL5GLUOJC9F4", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "Very poor image quality, poor color balance.  Night vision mode with the IR LEDs turned on the image has a double shift.  I can't get the unit to focus clearly in night mode.  The only reason I don't make this a 1 star is because in bright sun light the image is clear.650tvl resolution is 540tvl at best.  The OSD programming functions on this unit are useless.  The BLC & HLC features don't work for anything.  So very disappointed.  Don't waste your time or money on this product.I would recommend the Evertech EV-CDM268SN 700tvl model at a 1/3 of the price of this unit, with a MUCH MUCH better performance.", "Date": "March 6, 2013"}, {"Title": "Very nice.", "Author": "Buyer", "ReviewID": "R3HU5Z4WCYKWNX", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This was exactly what we were looking for.
