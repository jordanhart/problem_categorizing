One of them looks way to fake like it's a toy and I didn't get the right USB cable in the box. Instructions are NOT self explanatory. DO NOT BUY THIS. Buy something else with better reviews. it's better to buy something that's a bit more money and be satisfy with it.", "Date": "April 9, 2013"}, {"Title": "to big", "Author": "my3boys", "ReviewID": "R1FENVERRX5KXA", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "this is to big and obvious of what it is, totally not what was expected, I was really dissapointed and will never order anything like this again", "Date": "March 30, 2012"}, {"Title": "mr stern", "Author": "mitchell", "ReviewID": "R9PEBKTN06N7Y", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "the product was just as seen and worked perfectly the only thing it was missing the disk.
