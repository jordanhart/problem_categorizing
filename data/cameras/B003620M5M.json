It works great in our small business and I am hooking it up to an SVAT CV501 DVR System.  I am happy with the purchase and I recommend it.  Not to mention Shoptronics sent the item very fast and it was delivered in excellent condition.", "Date": "April 9, 2010"}, {"Title": "Great Camera", "Author": "John", "ReviewID": "R134GGPQ405CRT", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "The installation is easy and it works extremely well.  The default setup with the main system is good enough to start seeing things immediately.  I did change them, which is very easy using the mouse AND remote, to suit my specific needs.  The only thing I would suggest is for them to offer a \"paint-primed\" housing to let us change the color to disguise it more in certain situations.", "Date": "November 25, 2011"}, {"Title": "great camera", "Author": "william carico", "ReviewID": "R3R23CAYBYEP4", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "great camera for anyone!! works great real clear picture!! very nice camera at a very good price and really easy to setup", "Date": "December 21, 2013"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": "Unavailable", "Features": "Do-it-yourself video surveillance camera that can be set up in minutes; Easy to install with standard RCA video connection\nHi-res CCD camera with 420 TV lines of resolution; 12 infrared LEDs provide night vision up to 15 feet away\nAutomatic night vision control activates the IR LEDs when it gets dark; Wall, ceiling or table top mountable with extremely flexible bracket\nProfessional weatherproof/rust proof housing with sunshade; Weather resistant for all cold/wet/hot/dry seasons\n60 feet of cable included for greater camera placement flexibility; Connects easily to any surveillance system, TV, VCR, computer or DVR for viewing/recording", "Name": "SVAT VU301-C High Resolution Weatherproof Indoor/Outdoor Night Vision Color Surveillance CCD Security Camera", "ImgURL": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/315M8vwkuYL._SY300_.jpg", "ProductID": "B003620M5M"}}
