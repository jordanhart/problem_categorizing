I bought it through a different vendor than Amazon for $7, which even at that low of a price, it was a complete waste of money.  It will not take a picture unless the lighting is just right.  Even in a well lit room, it doesn't take pictures.  There isn't screen to see the picture after you take it, just a little counter of how many pictures are left.  Save up for a better camera.", "Date": "December 28, 2011"}, {"Title": "more toy less camera", "Author": "Danyell Rejcek", "ReviewID": "R3W260RZGWMVUT", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "great for a younger kid a first camera type of thing but beyond that you will be disappointed.... think about it first", "Date": "January 22, 2014"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": "$4.99", "Features": "PalmCliX camera is bundled with CD-ROM with the Ulead Photo Express 4.0 software.\nVGA: 640 x 480 Pixels\nCamera Size: 2 3/16\" x 2 11/16\" x O.5\"\nIncludes USB cable and 1 AAA battery.\nJust point and click!", "Name": "Palm Clix Complete Pocket Digital Camera/Webcam", "ImgURL": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/518ZgOdbktL._SX300_.jpg", "ProductID": "B005PZ1BR6"}}
