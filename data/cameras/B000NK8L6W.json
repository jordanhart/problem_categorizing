{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Trying to make a decision between Canon A series, S series, SD series?", "Author": "AmazonDiva \"Keep Calm and Carry On.\"", "ReviewID": "R3CV6NS6DJW3S4", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I have owned several Canon A series, Canon SD series, the Canon S series and also the S2/S3 IS. So here's the skinny as an amateur user.If you don't want to read the long review, here's the summary. Buy the SD1000 if you are looking for the tiniest camera that you can take everywhere. It takes good shots indoors given its tiny size and fabulous shots outdoors.If smallness is not your top priority then you should consider some other Canon cameras which may work better for you (including others from the SD Series).A series - The A series is best for you if you're looking for a low cost camera that gives you a wide range of features, many manual controls and great image quality. Although, the size is bigger than SD series making it a jacket-pocket camera, the advantage is in the styling. It gives you a  convenient grip on the side which helps hold the camera steady and results in less \"blurry\" pictures. The mode selector dial on top helps you zip through selections. The convenience of AA batteries which are available in every corner of the world, no missing out on pictures as your battery was discharged, might be a selling point for those who travel a lot.{Update 11/10/07: Canon launched many new A series cameras in August 2007 with Image Stabilization and improved zoom. The 7.1 MP A570 IS with 4X zoom is cheaper than this SD1000. You may want to consider it seriously if you don't care so much about the slightly large the size and increased weight.}The S3 to S5 IS series cameras have a great image sensor, the wonderful image stabilization, a great zoom, and super macro function that can produce never before pictures. The flip out screen helps take shots from angles you've never considered before. The videos mode of the S series is  also better with stereo sound and a sharp picture. The cameras in this series are also just a little more expensive and pretty bulky. If taking great pictures is all you care about and do not mind carrying a big camera, the S series will be a great choice. It's the first step towards a real professional camera.And finally (drumroll) - the SD series. Small. Cute.The SD 1000 slips into your shirt front pocket without making it sag. If you're wondering about the style, the square \"retro\" design is boxy but I like it better as it is very compact. It also does not slip out from my fingers as easily as the curved edge ones.Since the cameras in SD series are so small some features like different shooting modes are accessible only through the menu which makes changing between them more cumbersome. Sometimes I've just preferred to stay on Auto rather than missing the shot while I navigated to the right mode. SD series cameras also have less manual or user defined controls like flash power reduction which I miss. The flash incidentally, can get very strong in lower light or indoor situations and often bleaches out color from people's faces. If you turn off the flash then you have to use a tripod or have the camera on a flat surface to prevent shaky pictures. I also find that the smallness and lightness of SD series makes my hand shake more than when I'm holding the A series camera with the side grip. I get more fuzzy pics with the SD series than my A series (comparing the models without Image Stabilization) and it's annoying to see the camera-shake warning each time on the screen I am trying to take a shot. I also get a little more red eye with this series probably because the flash is so close to the lens. On the SD 1000 however, there is a red eye correction feature so you can remove red eye right on the camera. The other improvement over the previous SD series is the automatic face detection which helps reduce the flash glare on faces so pictures come out better.Having used many Canons, although I prefer some other models for their pictures, guess which camera travels with me most often. My SD1000. Just because it's small and fits into my tiny party purse or jeans pocket. Canon recently launched some SD series cameras with Image Stabilization like SD850 IS which is slightly more expensive and a bit bigger and heavier than the SD1000. I'd probably never take it along with me on daily basis and would miss some great photo ops...Many of my friends bought the SD1000 camera after seeing the size of my camera vs. its range of features (and the reasonable price!)And what about some other Canon features? (If you're a regular Canon user skip reading this section, as you already know all this good stuff.):- It has an intelligent focusing system with DIGIC III (up from DIGIC II earlier) auto red eye correction and face detection (see above).- Goes up to ISO 1600 which improves it's low light performance. Although beware of camera shake if you turn off flash in low light. In my opinion, Canon has always out-performed all other consumer cameras in outdoor pics. For indoor low-light pics you'll have to turn on the flash or end up with grainy images. However, compared to other brands in the same class the SD1000 still takes pretty sharp pictures.- SD card slot - cheap to buy 2GB cards.-Photo-stitch - For stitching together panoramic views. I have shot countless seascapes, 'bridge'scapes, and landscapes from all my Canons using this function and stitching together 6-10 shots in one. It's easy.-Macro mode - Great for close ups of babies or product shots- The SCN mode (special scenes)- Fireworks, Beach, Snow, kids and pets, Underwater, Foliage, Aquarium and Indoor is great. Now even amateurs can use Canon experience to get the best shot quickly before they miss the photo opportunity while trying to set manual controls.-\"My colors\" option - Allows you to choose a color you want to highlight in a picture or even darken and lighten skin tones. Color Accent allows you to capture only a particular color in a shot while the rest of the picture is black and white. I did a black and white Christmas group portrait with only the Santa hats, ornaments and poinsettias in red color. Or with Color Swap you can swap out one color with the other, like change your car or (or hair color!)- red to blue. The possibilities are endless, even my kid loves to use the color accent feature as it's really easy.-Special effects (B/W, Sepia, Vivid, Nuetral etc.) I've used sepia a lot when taking portraits giving them an 'old world' feel. Vivid has been helpful in special situations like a red kite against a blue sky to bring out the colors. You can do all this in Photoshop later but how many of us actually get the time to do this, once a pic is taken it's over with for me!-You can also take videos in 3 different resolutions with this camera and edit them right on the camera.-You can create a slide show of all the images you took on the camera itself with fancy transition effects of your choice, it adds to the fun when you hook it up to a TV to view your pics.-The zoom button shows one or many images at a time in the replay mode and you can zoom into each individual image to see parts of it closely. You can also add sound bites to your shots to remember a location.- While replaying, the images auto-rotate to landscape or portrait mode to align with how you're holding the camera. It's a nice feature. The screen has been made more durable than it was earlier with an anti-reflective coating.All in all, if you want a small and sexy yet very feature rich camera go for the SD1000, you'll find yourself using it more often than your previous cameras.", "Date": "May 15, 2007"}, {"Title": "Super SD1000", "Author": "Jarrod \"Slider\"", "ReviewID": "R3AAJ950F5QE2C", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I did all sorts of research on the SD600.  I had made up my mind that the SD600 was the camera for me.  The SD1000 is the newer kid on the block and therefore did not have many reviews.  And that is why I am here today.  The SD1000 is the newest version of the SD600 with a few additions.  Those few additions make this camera AWESOME.  I love the ISO choices.  I was zooming on my local Calif. freeways at around 80mph and decided to take a few shots of passing signs out my passenger window.  At the high speed the ISO caught such great detail that I could clearly read the sign later at home.  That means that despite the small size the camera filtered out the shake of my hand, the shake from the road, and compensated for the fast movement. The color options are very much the same as other Canon Powershot models.  MACRO is so much fun to play with on this camera.  The button layout is easy to figure out.  Lighting options like White balance are a button push away.  With the Face Detection option on you are sure to get a great photo of the family.  I have been playing with it none stop for over a week.  Get at least a gig for memory.  The only downside that I have found, and it is a minor one, is that when the battery warning comes on it means that you have 1-2 more pics and then it shuts off.  I ordered another battery ahead of time and it was worth it.  The batteries charge in about 30-40mins. This is a great camera.  If you are thinking about the SD600 step up and get the SD1000.  You will not be disappointed with it.", "Date": "April 5, 2007"}, {"Title": "Great point & shoot - small, fast, great pictures,", "Author": "tinkerte.ch", "ReviewID": "R1QQKLJZS9O502", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Great camera, just chosen as editor's choice by PC mag as well.[...]I have it for about 3 weeks now, couple of family parties later I am really happy with this little one. Fits even in tight jeans pockets, and is quick to take pictures. Face recognition works really well, not flawless, but really amazing. I took about 300 shots so far and they are mostly great quality, some indoor pictures without the flash are a bit blurry, if you don't hold it steady.My 4 year old niece was running around with it and took nice shots just on her own with the automatic setting, pretty amazing. Flash can be a bit strong when to close indoors. It takes fast pictures and is very easy to understand. I still have to read the manual, though. ;-)I added a fast 2GB card and even the video quality is pretty good, althought just avi format, not mpg. Sound is great. It even has a speaker when you play the video for review. Outside pictures are outstanding quality. I had some outside self-timer family pictures enlarged at the store to 20-30cm, and the picture quality is awesome. Highly recommended when you want a camera you can carry with you at ALL times!", "Date": "April 12, 2007"}, {"Title": "Wanted to like it, but ended up returning it", "Author": "Jesper", "ReviewID": "R2T6ZDOWJVOBNB", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "I really wanted to like this camera.  I've been a fan and user of Canon's Digital Elph cameras since I got my first one (S110).  Since then I've upgraded a couple of times, first to an S500 then to an SD450 and I was looking forward to the SD1000; more megapixels, higher ISO, the old retro look, and the new DIGIC III.  At first, having received the camera, I was very pleased.  The look and feel of the camera is great, the form factor is great, but reviewing some of the first actual shots out of the camera was very disappointing.  They were all very grainy.  None had the sharpness of the pictures from my old Digital Elph cameras, even the ones shot at ISO80.  I proceeded taking more pictures trying all kind of different settings, not wanting to accept that Canon possibly had taken a step backwards with this newest version of the Elph camera, but at the end of the day, I had to admit it.  This camera was not living up to my expectations, and I decided to return.  It is possible, and I hope, that I got a bad lens or camera, but I am not so sure as I have seen other reviews on the Internet that describes my experience with the SD1000 model.", "Date": "April 23, 2007"}, {"Title": "VERY HAPPY!", "Author": "Music Is Alive!", "ReviewID": "R2JUB89EWZTDUS", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Canon all the way! I've had an s230, sd300, sd400, sd630. I really did not like the feel of the SD630 very much after living with it for a while. I also didn't like the button placements..was not comfortable with it. It DID take great pics and video. BUT, I moved to the SD1000 (black), have had it one week and love it!Of all the Canon point-and-shoot digitals, this is my favorite. It is tiny and so pocketable. A pleasure to use. The switches and buttons are where they should be and feel good. The screen is 2.5 so people who want 3.0 need to go to the SD750 which is basically the SD630's replacement with the Digic III processor. Same form factor.If you liked the SD200, SD300, SD400, SD450 or SD600, you will love this!My only reservation is how great ARE the pics from this little camera. I'm sure they are excellent but the jury is out on how good they are compared to earlier Canons. I like vivid pics so I may have to set the camera to vivid.Got a good deal at Amazon.", "Date": "March 25, 2007"}, {"Title": "No IS? No matter! Pictures still come out sharp.", "Author": "U Lala", "ReviewID": "RSIYZ2RTL1Q4T", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I usually don't take the time to review any items, but I'm just so impressed by quality of this camera. When compared to other ultra-compact cameras from Canon or other brands, this one should be the obvious choice.I started off with a Canon PowerShot S100 back in the days, then \"upgraded\" to a Sony P51 (the one with the dreaded black LCD problem), the P200, and Casio Exilim Z60 (which takes great daylight photos but notoriously bad low-light shots). (I also have a Sony Ericsson K800i 3.2MP camera phone.) Recently I bought a Panasonic Lumix DMC-FX12 which boasted Panasonic's \"reknowned\" MEGA Optical Image Stabilization (O.I.S.) technology, but I returned it because its low-light images still came out blurry anyway (even with flash!). OIS is useless if the autofocus just plain sucks. Then I got myself an SD850 IS, but then I returned that because I could not justify the price tag. I took a gamble and went for the SD1000 because it is almost the same exact camera, just thinner and without OIS. It's also $130 cheaper. My brother got himself the SD750K, which I have played with extensively. I think I prefer the models without OIS because they usually come .2 inches thinner. This camera is only 0.8 inches thick, compared to the 1 inch thickness on any model w/ OIS.First and foremost, you must realize that almost every camera will take at least a decent picture in perfect lighting (daylight), so the true test of a camera's image quality lies in its night and low-light shots. That said, the image quality of photos taken from the SD1000 is consistently beautiful, in good or bad lighting. Good color balance & auto white balance, strong low-light performance, and a very smart flash that doesn't cause too much glare. You can enable \"Slow Synchro\" if you're old fashioned and want to slow down the shutter speed to expose more of the background in night shots, but I personally don't use it. Many cameras today will blast the flash too strongly; others too weakly.I shoot most of my pictures at ISO 200 or under, so image noise is very low (almost non-existent at ISO 80). I really would not recommend shooting anything at ISO 1600 because they are really terrible. Even when resized to 640x480 they are bad. Even ISO 800 is pushing it. Other than that, images come out sharp and detailed even when zoomed in to native resolution, though low-light pictures will always be of reduced quality.Once in a while you will get a blurry picture from this camera, but it's almost always because of user error. Either it's because I have shaky hands, or I didn't have choose good settings for the situation.It is a super tiny camera (0.8 inches thick) with a nice boxy feeling. It feels much nicer and intuitive than those so-called \"ergonomic\" curvy cameras. It has the best mode switcher in any camera--a simple loose slider that switches from camera, video camera, and playback. Very nifty! Durability-wise, it feels solid.The button layout is great, though I feel it's missing a button. It would be nice to have a dedicated button to change EV compensation (Yes, you can use the programmable button to do this but I have it programmed to record video instantly).There is no Optical Image Stabilization on this baby, but then again that feature is overrated and overhyped anyway. It's really only useful in low-light situations--and even then, only if you do not want to use the flash. Most people will use flash in most low-light situations anyway, so why do you even need image stabilization?You can change ISO manually (with a simple press of the UP key) and even shutter speed (15 seconds is the slowest you can get). The only thing you can't set manually is the f-stop/aperture setting. Very few (if any) ultracompact cameras will let you adjust these.The optical viewfinder is tiny and annoying to use, but hey at least it HAS a viewfinder. Using the viewfinder has three main benefits: (1) it's much more battery-efficient, (2) it stabilizes the camera by holding it against your face, and (3) it is usable in bright areas where the LCD might be washed out. Many ultracompact digicams today are completely reliant on the LCD screen, like the PowerShot SD750. One more thing: note that while the SD750 has a 3\" screen, it still has the same pixel resolution (230,000 pixels) as the SD1000.And last of all, compatibility with Windows XP is excellent. I have it set up so that plugging in the USB cable to the camera (it's always plugged into the computer) will automatically create a dated folder, copy all of the files in the camera into that folder, and delete them off the camera. I don't even have to do anything except click OK. I don't bother with card readers.UPDATE - 2008-06-09After owning this camera for almost over a year, learning a LOT more about photography, and being about 50 shots shy of 10,000 shots, I am lowering this camera down to 4/5 stars.So here are some of the annoyances I've had to deal with:I take back what I said about IS: it is a very important function when you need to take pictures at slower shutter speeds. I am deathly afraid to take any shot slower than 1/20s because it will almost always be blurry (unless I have a tripod).Limited flash range - if you're too close, the picture will get lots of glare, if you're too far, everything will just look dark. The sweetspot range is quite small. Also, the flash is too close to the lens, which means tons of red-eye, despite \"red eye\" flash mode.Dynamic range capabilities are quite weak (due to high megapixels on a tiny 1/2.5\" sensor): highlight and shadow clipping galore. For example, when you take a picture of a bright lit object in a dark room, the object will appear very white and glary, while the rest of the room will look darker than it should. This camera should've had 5 MP at MOST.Camera body is made of cheap plastic. While I was using a tripod, the bottom of the camera became dislodged, disabling the LCD. It was still able to take pictures and record. However, Canon's RMA process is very fast and professional, and I got my camera back within about 4 days free of charge.That said, Canon seems to make VERY sharp lenses compared to other manufacturers, but there is a little bit of barrel distortion on this particular one. It's not a big deal if you take a step back for your shot. However, I would have liked a wide angle lens. Also, the DIGIC III processor probably the biggest redeeming factor to this camera - it is fast and efficient.PS: There is a \"firmware\" hack (Google: CHDK) for many Canon cameras, including the SD1000, that allows you to do manual controls and custom scripts. It's not really a firmware hack because it does not change the actual camera firmware, and it can be switched off at any time.", "Date": "August 8, 2007"}, {"Title": "Good for daylight shooting.", "Author": "Luis E. D. Gimenez", "ReviewID": "R39A52042KFYZ5", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I recently purchased the SD 1000 to replace a Nikon Coolpix E5600. The SD 1000 has a very appealing design (depending upon your taste of course but in any case, it doesn't look cheap) and as you can see from pictures posted on this site, it is small and very pocketable. The SD series is all about small form factor and lack of full manual controls (as offered on some of the A series cameras) but good point and shoot capabilities. In this regard, the SD 1000 delivers what the rest of the SD series promises. Fast and accurate focusing, face detection that really works (and I mean good face exposure and not just detection), very fast response with almost unnoticeable shutter lag; surprisingly fast burst mode (even with a slow SD card), accurate color and many other features mentioned by other reviewers. As I said, I wasn't expecting full manual controls as the small size was more important for me (I already own a Digital Rebel). You do get control over the ISO settings and the white balance. The first is particularly important which takes me to the aspect that I don't like about this camera. Being a 7.1 megapixel camera, I expected some noise, but not as much as I got with the Auto ISO setting and no flash (available light) indoors. Believe me when I say that indoor pictures with these settings are VERY noisy. You can avoid this by lowering the ISO setting to 200 or less. But then, the lens is so slow that camera shake becomes an issue, making it almost impossible to take a good picture with available light under low lighting conditions. ISO settings higher than 200 are pretty much worthless because of the high noise levels (even higher than my horrible Coolpix). This is a shame as this camera is very good under good lighting conditions. I guess I will just have to use the flash indoors or carry my D-SLR. I don't recommend this camera as your sole travel companion (you never know when you're going to be in a situation where flash can't be used) or if you expect to shoot a lot indoors with no flash. I still like overall performance and small form factor so I give it four stars.", "Date": "June 29, 2007"}, {"Title": "Love this camera", "Author": "egghead23", "ReviewID": "R33EQ6DIB6NIYG", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I wouldn't consider myself an avid photographer.

After using it for a few weeks, I noticed how the portability factor really becomes an issue - cant take it on a date, cant place it anywhere but around the neck (the summer heat makes it worse)... silly to even bring along on a hike.  That being said, I decided to invest on a smaller and more compact camera for all the small everyday moments that I had missed out on with the SLR.You cant go wrong with the Canon SD1000.Not wanting to spluge on another camera, the SD1000 is the perfect combination of form, functions, and value.  If you're here, you probably already read about its aperture capabilities, ISO (1600!!), and the specs for the photographer in you.  So Im going to skip all that and go down to the \"goodies\".One thing that immediately wowed me is the motion sensor equipped within the camera.  Much like the unrelated iPhone, the SD1000 is able to orient pictures base on the camera's position (vertical/ horizontal).  As a bonus, horizontal alignment brings up the time, and vertical brings up the date.  You can even change the background color - how cool is that!Another thing not found on cameras of this price is the color swapping technology.  Now I can pretend I have a new paint job on the car!  But seriously, being able to concentrate on a single color can really make some shots inspiring and artsy.  Canon even allows you to automatically save the original and the tempered one right after the shot is taken.I simply cant wait to tinker around with the SD1000 thats sitting right next to me, so here ends my review.You have to try out this camera (Canon's done it again!)---Great software package too!", "Date": "August 4, 2007"}, {"Title": "Thought I would buy a Sony but decided on Canon", "Author": "Wayne LaFeen", "ReviewID": "R3LDZZ3G4HK244", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "When I started my research to buy a digital camera, I quickly narrowed the models to be considered down to two from Sony and one from Canon.Unlike most consumers, one of the things that was madatory for me when choosing a digital camera was an optical viewfinder.  I also liked the idea of a digital camera that would operate on AA batteries.  My megapixel requirement was not very high; 6 megapixels or more was all that I needed.I checked many resources and reviews of the three cameras online and found that all three were highly rated and well regarded by consumers and experts alike.  I was leaning toward a Sony if for no other reason than that I own several Sony products and I am very happy with them all.  Once I went to a store to actually see the cameras, I quickly disregarded one of the Sony models because I just did not like the fact that the zoom toggle was on the back of the camera.  The other Sony and the Canon have the zoom toggle around the shutter button which I much prefer.  The other reason I decided against the Sonys is because they both had very flimsy covers over their A/V and A/C jacks.  The plastic covers were so flimsy I was afraid they would soon break even with careful handling.  I found no such concerns anywhere on the Canon model.In the end, I made my choice based on build quality.  This Canon camera is well constructed and works great.  It does not operate on AA batteries but that's OK by me.  It is the smallest of the three cameras I was considering and that was of some concern for me as I would prefer a slightly larger overall camera.

After researching dozens of cameras I settle on the SD1000 with it's  mix of features, low price and good reviews. I took it and my Minolta on vacation and took over 200 pictures in the first few days. About halfway through my trip I took out the Canon and took a picture then went to turn it off. The camera refused to retract the lend and made a little grinding noise. The screen displayed the message 'lens error, restart camera'. After trying every combination of buttons to see if there was some trick to get the camera to work again I gave up. I was lucky to have a backup camera on my trip otherwise I would have been left in the cold as this error as it turns out, means the camera must be sent in for service. A gold star goes to Amazon for promptly sending out a replacement and accepting the return on their dime. Canon on the other hand wanted me to pay to ship it back to them and wait until they fixed it.In terms of the quality of the camera, it seems very good and takes pretty good pictures although I have to say that when I view the 7 mega-pixel images at 100%, they all look slightly grainy, wheres my old Minolta 5 mega-pixel pictures look razor sharp at 100%. The controls are easy to use and the large screen is very helpful. The only feature I wish they had added to this camera is some sort of image stabilization. The pictures taken by this camera in auto mode or manual mode both seem prone to have a very slight blur to them. All in all I'm satisfied with the camera but will have to see if my replacement model suffers the same fate as the original one.", "Date": "July 18, 2007"}, {"Title": "Less than 2 months old and getting an error", "Author": "MG", "ReviewID": "R2UT9RMTRWFTIE", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "Up until yesterday this camera would have gotten 5 stars.

I actually had decided to go with A570 - but it rejected 2 sets of hi-quality rechargable batteries and screen display was low resolution and hard to see.  Screen wasn't much better than my trusty A85 that I own now - just a bigger.  Overall, I found the A570, and SD850 to take the best quality pics - I went with SD850 that printed superior pics even tho it's more expensive than SD1000.  Pics printed from SD1000 were nearly identical in quality to my A85 that I've had for 3 years.  I want an upgrade in picture quality, not the same quality.  Don't get me wrong -  if you've never had a digital, then you'll like the SD1000 pics and they are very nice.  I'm just looking for a little better. The great things about the SD1000 are it's great layout of play/camera button, on/off switch etc. -much better than SD850 - and I also love the size and feel of this camera.  I like the \"boxiness\" better than the SD850 or SD970 by far.  The LCD screen is outstanding too - but so is screen on SD850.  BTW, if you wear polarized sunglasses, SD1000 screen still is viewable - it must not have the anti-glare coating that SD870 has which makes it useless if you wear polarized sunglasses.While picture quality was more important to me this time, SD1000 still prints great pics with minimal effort - I'm a P&S; person using \"auto\" almost all the time.

The Canon rep I just spoke to on the phone said the camera parts should arrive within another 2 weeks (5 weeks after receipt of camera), and that cameras would be repaired in order of receipt.  Then, she matter-of-factly stated that some cameras in the repair shop have been in there \"for two to three months\" and they still hadn't gotten to them, yet somehow her logic still compelled her to say that they would start repairing mine after the parts were received after 2 weeks.  When I asked if there was anyone I could complain to, she sarcastically replied \"I'm listening,\" before transferring me to her supervisor.Her supervisor basically reiterated the company line, saying \"parts are ordered overseas from Japan,\" \"it takes some time for them to arrive from a foreign country,\" and that the repair confirmation e-mail and repair policy, which stipulates 7-10 business days for repair and return, does have the following caveat: \"Actual times may vary. Seasonal volume or repairs requiring special parts may add more time,\" which is the catch-all for circumstances like this in which, as the supervisor put it, camera servicing may take \"more than 30 days to order parts and complete the repair.\"  He provided no possible remediation at all, just served as another complaint buffer, and offered to continue referring me to further supervisors, which presumably would have just reiterated the company's repair caveat: \"Actual [repair] times may vary.\"If you dare, buy the camera -- it was a great camera for 2 weeks until it broke -- but cross your fingers that it doesn't ever need to be repaired.

I also like the fact Canon packages the cameras with an equally small, international charger (requires adapter overseas).  They also tend to be in the quicker category of cameras.But they are lacking in a few features.  The similarly priced Olympus FE-240 has a 5x optical zoom, and the VERY similar Sony DSC-W55 is priced less.

I will only point out some different pro's and con's.I am using Canon PowerShot cameras for years. They mostly have imoroved. What I like about the new SD1000 (up from my SD700 IS) is the 2:3 aspect ratio assitance - in short: You all know that digital cameras take picture a little wider than 4 inches, and when you print your photos, it always gets cut down from both sides. It's hard to figure out while shooting where exactly to point the camera. So with the help of the SD1000, it marks those spots grey, so you know exactly how your photo will look like after printing. Beautiful.Another good thing, is that settings and menus are much better designed. You could see more selections on screen. Hard to explain, but if you used Canon in the past, you'll immediately see what I mean. I also love Canon for the ease-of-use. Everything is so simple!But the bad things are much more. The zoom lever is dificult to control. They used to make the pointer much bigger, now it's so tiny and annoying. The battery/Card door is so flimsy. Why don't they use the excellent design from their own SD700, which was spring assisted? Besides that, still no zooming while shooting video. And still recording only on uncompressed AVI format, which will give you about 1/2 hour of video on a 2 gb card! MPEG ot other compressed format should be an option, like most other manufacturers are offering. Also, a big problem which was mentiond so many times and Canon doesn't seem to listen, is the absence of a BATTERY METER. You have no idea the strength of your battery, until minutes before it dies.

BTW I have found great 2GB SD cards work in this camera for less than $18.--Canon PowerShot SD1000 OperationOperating the SD1000 in Auto mode is straightforward and simple, albeit with limited access to some of the camera's controls. Manual mode offers more options and is relatively intuitive and, with the user guide in hand, easy to master. Most controls are no more than a button push away via the 4-way controller (ISO, Flash, Single/Continuous Shooting and Self-Timer, and Macro/Normal/Infinity), a Function Menu (Shooting Mode, Exposure Compensation, White Balance, My Colors, Metering, JPEG compression, and Resolution) or the full system menu, with set-up options and settings that generally do not have to be changed very often. There are a few exceptions, however, including the need to activate Face Detection or AiAF, red-eye reduction and slow synchro flash settings and Grid Overlay via the system menu. Although there are no dedicated control buttons per se, the Print/Share button can be programmed for one of a number of controls for direct access.Canon SD1000 Modes and MenusAuto Record Mode: In this mode, the camera automatically selects the settings for image capture, although compression and image size options are available in the Function menu. Limited options are also available for ISO, Flash, Self-Timer and Macro.Manual Mode: Since the camera lacks manual aperture and shutter speed controls, the SD1000's \"Manual\" mode provides access to various settings and features like Exposure Compensation, White Balance, ISO and other options via the Function menu and 4-way controller.Scene Mode: A variety of scene modes are available in the Function menu, including Digital Macro, Portrait, Night Snapshot, Kids & Pets, Indoor, Foliage, Snow, Beach, Fireworks, Aquarium, and Underwater.Movie Mode: Accessed via the mode switch, this mode records movies with sound. Movie options include Standard (640 x 480 or 320 x 240; both resolutions can be recorded at either 30 frames per second or 15fps), with a 4GB size maximum, although the camera will stop recording after 1 hour of continuous shooting regardless of whether or not the SD card has been filled. Fast Frame Rate, which is limited to a 1 minute clip, is designed to photograph action such as a sporting event. The Compact mode records a clip of up to 3 minutes and is small enough to be e-mailed. Color Accent and Color Swap modes, which allow you to shoot in black and white maintaining one color as an accent or you can change (swap) one color for another. Recording pixels and frame rate (640 x 480 or 320 x 240 at 30fps or 15fps) are selectable and movies can be recorded up to 4GB, although recording will stop after 1 hour of continuous shooting even if the 4GB maximum as not been reached. In Time Lapse mode, the camera can be set to capture an image every 1 or 2 seconds for up to 2 hours. When played back, the final \"movie\" will be compressed to 4 or 8 minutes, depending on the interval set (2 second intervals will net a 4 minute movie after two hours; 1 second intervals will net an 8 minute movie after two hours). Although sound recording is not available in this mode, you can create interesting clips such as tracking the progress of a house being built, a dinner being prepared (and consumed) or plants blooming. Note: Standard and Color Accent/Color Swap modes require a high speed and high capacity SD card to reach maximum recording time.Playback Mode: Also accessed via the mode switch, playback allows you to review images for content and quality, arrange them into categories, mark them for printing and deletion. Movies can also be viewed an edited in this mode. .Record Menu System: This menu is displayed when the Menu button is pressed.

When on, the digital zoom engages after the optical zoom has reached the maximum telephoto focal length. The digital zoom can also be set to a fixed 1.5x or 1.9x zoom. The digital zoom can also be utilized for the Standard movie mode.Slow Synchro: Sets the flash synchro option on and off. When on, shutter stays open longer (slower shutter speed) to record more ambient light so the areas not reached by the flash are more visible and better exposed.Red-Eye: Sets the flash red-eye reduction on and off.Self-Timer: Sets the Self-Timer delay from 0-10 seconds, or 15, 20, or 30 seconds. Sets the number of consecutive shots taken from 1-10; the default setting is 3 shots.Auto ISO Shift: Turns the Auto ISO Shift on and off. When on, depress the shutter button halfway and press the Print/Share Button to automatically boost the ISO to an appropriate setting up to ISO 800.

The images did have vibrant color, but every single one of them was fuzzy and soft, outside or inside, with or without flash.  Maybe it's the lense?

I bought this to replace our old Canon A40 2MP camera.  Still picture quality is comparable between the two cameras, but the SD1000 is much more compact and works a lot faster.  Picture quality is not top of the line, but very good for an ultra-compact in this budget price range.  The video mode is excellent and can rival a similarly priced miniDV camcorder.  Unlike older Canon models (SD600/700/800/900), this camera can work with SDHC media which lets you store a lot of video.  The proprietary battery is no big deal as a generic replacement can be had for less than $15 at Amazon.The only two negatives I have about this camera is the lack of image stabilization, and the inability to adjust zoom while filming a video.  The lack of these features is clearly explained in the product description at Amazon, and at Canon's own website and is no secret.  If those features were available, this camera can easily replace the photo and video camera for everyday use.  Ability to insert the SD card to the computer and instantly copy video clips as AVI files is a huge advantage over miniDV.

I had been pursuing photography as a fun hobby for many years, and quite enjoyed it.  Only thing was, although my photographs were good (trust me they were :-D ), they were probably like MOST amateur/hobbyist photographer's pics in that they weren't good enough to ever make a museum or \"get shown.\"  So I was spending a lot of money on \"better lenses\" and \"better bodies\" to get larger file sizes that were essentially sitting on my hard drives, never printing many except to put on my walls - which are finite, and show on my webpage - which doesn't get many hits, especially for that sort of thing.  My breaking point was seeing some professional galleries online one day.  The guy was using very expensive gear, and taking some rather breathtaking shots in some rather breathtaking locations.  I realized that 1) I don't have the disposable income to get that sort of equipment, and 2) even if I did, I don't have the time to travel to places like that, and 3) since I'm not traveling much, if I am going to take a picture of something I probably already HAVE a picture of it anyway at this point, and finally 4) even if I did buy the pricey equipment, I just don't have quite the talent of these guys to worry about whether my prints will get \"shown;\" they won't, I'd be spending money to fill up my hard drive with pictures that are only 95% as good as the struggling professionals anyway.Another big issue I had dealt with with regards to the DSLR was bulk.  I wasn't even taking it with me.  My Fianc\u00e9 had gotten this exact same camera and it was always on her.  Her pictures when posted to the web were not any worse than mine.  So I jumped on board, because \"the camera you take with you is infinitely better than the camera you leave behind.\"Now I take quick and easy photos that I can share with family & friends.  I let the camera do the heavy lifting on the photos, and if one comes out under or overexposed, I just take another one.  The quality of the pictures is decent.  They are not too soft, but they could be sharper.  Then again, it's a sub-$200 camera and I jumped down from a $1000+ setup that I wished was sharper too.  I save a lot of time just importing as JPEG instead of RAW (this camera doesn't support RAW by the way), and not 'tweaking' much.The images themselves come out pretty good 85% of the time.  The colors are accurate, the sharpness is adequate, and the exposure is good, if slightly over (more on that in a sec).  And since it's so pocketable, you're going to have it with you, which makes the \"decent\" photos you're going to take with it infinitely better than the \"awesome\" photos you didn't take with the camera that was too big to come along.CAMERA FUNCTIONS:The camera has a multitude of settings to fiddle with.  They have lots of presets, from full-auto to modes tuned for \"kids & pets,\" Night shots, macro closeups (flowers, etc), fireworks, and more.  And for me - a control junkie - they also have a \"manual\" mode which is more like \"Exposure priority\" than full-manual.  You have control over Base ISO (more on that in a minute), white balance (which features an option to set the white balance too), and even exposure compensation.  I tend to think that the camera slightly overexposes pics by default, so I set mine to compensate for that here.One of my most-liked features is the ISO-shift that is available in Manual mode.  Since picture quality suffers as ISO goes up, I try to keep the ISO below 200 whenever possible.  With ISO-shift enabled, if I frame a picture and the camera determines that with the ISO I have set the camera shutter speed will be too slow & possibly create blur, it warns me by blinking a blue LED on one of the back buttons near my thumb.  Pressing this button toggles the camera to a higher ISO for that shot only.  However, if you decide that the ISO it selects is too high for your tastes and you'd rather try a steady hand to prevent motion blur, another press toggles your preselected ISO back into action.The size of the camera is a real boon.  Considering its lack of heft versus the quality of the pics it produces, I'd say it's a winner.  YES, you can find a camera that takes better pictures.  You could even find a camera that's smaller.  But you can't find one that's better at both than this little guy, and for the price it produces very acceptable pictures that are crisp enough to share online easily, or even make family album prints (think 4x6, 5x7, even 8x10).Sometimes I miss the quality of my DSLR.  But then I grab my little camera and take a picture and remember that in the time it took me to take that picture, I'd still be removing dust caps and setting the parameters on the big guy, and I smile.  I love my little pocket camera and I think most people that venture this direction will agree.P.S:  I also tried a slightly more expensive model, the SD870.  The pictures weren't any crisper nor the colors more vibrant.  For the very few features it offered over the SD1000 model, I'd say it's just too much money.  Daily, you won't notice a difference and in fact I found the SD870 more a pain to work the controls than the SD1000.  And in comparison between the models, I could rarely get the Image Stabilization - which the SD1000 lacks - to make any noticeable impact on my pictures.  Your mileage may vary, but in my experience the SD1000 takes pics just as good for less cost and less hassle.", "Date": "April 6, 2008"}, {"Title": "My experience with the Canon Powershot SD1000", "Author": "Rockster", "ReviewID": "R1VN51IU0YFE8Q", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I bought this little camera for a trip I had coming up to France because it was small and would be easy to carry around.

The basic operating controls are simpler than the older camera, as there are fewer of them. The Print share button is now programmible in the shooting mode, and should be set to Exposure Compensation. This gives the photographer very good manual control of the camera without having to delve into the Main or Set Menu, if not in the classical sense.The body is quite small, about 1/4 inch thinner than the SD110, but still quite solid in feel. The rubber cap allowing access to the USB and AV connections has been replaced by a hinged, close fitting matching plastic door. The build quality is equal to or better than the older camera, but Canon should have kept the turned metallic surrounding lens treatment of the SD110, and perhaps reversed the black treatment of the black model.Battery and memory access is equally good in both cameras. Battery life is very good in the SD1000, but warning of the need to be charged is short. In fact, it's non existant. You get warned, you might get one more shot (or not). Buy an extra battery, keep it charged, and keep it with you. Overall, the camera is worth the effort.If you've been using almost any small digital more than about 2 years old, with an optical viewfinder (or even a larger camera, like my D70 or my daughter's Digital Rebel), you will love the LCD screen on the SD1000. The optical viewfinder on the new Elph, by my reconing, shows about 2/3 to 3/4 of what the camera actually picks up, at all zoom settings. I think that optical viewfinders belong on any camera that represents itself as a serious camera, and the accuracy should be closer to 90% at distances of over 3 feet.All in all, if you also own a DSLR, this is a very nice little \"daily driver\".It's a small, solid and (if you carry a charged extra battery) very reliable companion. If this will be your only digital camera, start at the top and look at the Canon G7, and work your way down in price through the A700 series to the A500 series.

Chromatic aberration (purple fringing) is minimal and there is excellent sharpness. It's fast too!The reason for the lens being stuck was that it was full of grit - basically sand and what looked like body glitter!  Realize this: whenever the lens extends, it creates a vacuum effect and sucks in whatever is around the camera; the camera is not perfectly sealed.  If you keep the camera in a dirty environment, or (as is tempting with a camera this size) just drop it into your lint-filled pocket or purse without any protection, that stuff will eventually get inside the lens, and eventually jam it up.The internal gears that drive the lens are sturdy and were none the worse for wear.

Camera menu is easy to navigate, buttons are well placed.  Battery lasts around 200-300 shots before it dies, which is pretty decent, I highly recommend a backup battery though.On camera flash is quite good for its size, nice skin tone, lots of fun in-camera post process function, can even stitch panoramatic photos in camera!It's got video recording function, but it's got flaws, the zoom and auto-focus will lock when you start recording, which kinda sucks :( But the video recording quality(and sound) is as good as a cheap DV!I love this little toy, it's the best money can buy.", "Date": "January 28, 2008"}, {"Title": "Fantastic Camera", "Author": "Seriously Casual", "ReviewID": "RMJXFS0O4PPMI", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This is definitely the slickest ultra-compact out there.

The shutter seemed slow indoors in not-particularly-low light, but I'd only had it for a couple days so maybe could have played with the settings if I'd known how.Would have kept the SD1000, but our battery did not seem to be functioning right -- we only got a few hours out of a fully charged battery (and it's not like we were leaving it on), sometimes had trouble turning the camera on when it was just charged, and constantly got messages to recharge soon after charging.

I understand that this ia a point and shoot camera, and as such i don't expect a professional level of output from it, but I figured the 7.1MP would help make up for it somewhat. Unfortunately, it does not seem to have mattered. I used to have an old 3.1MP Canon digital camera that took better pictures than this. I don't know enough about this camera and its construction to know what accounts for this, but I guess it must have something to do with the size of the lens and the size of the camera being so small.I just know the following: this camera produces very noisy pictures if you are shooting indoors or in low light, even with the flash on. The lower the light the higher the noise on this camera. I understand that happens with every camera, but with this it is really unforgiving and really pronounced. I'm not talking about shooting pictures in a closet; I'm talking about shooting pictures indoors with all the lights on and the flash on.If you want to learn more about what camera noise is, go to Google or another search engine and type in \"camera noise.\" Anyway, the noise level is very high and very noticeable with this camera. I returned it and bought a 6.0MP Nikon Coolpix L11 for almost half the price and I think it takes much better pictures with much less noise. Plus the flash on the L11 is about twice as good.What are the pros? The size and the design are awesome, just awesome. If you want something small, light, and stylish then this if for you. The size is so awesome that I almost kept it. If size is a must for whatever reason then by all means go with this. Unfortunately with the noise level being so great in the pictures I had to return it, however. I would rather have good pictures than a camera that looks good.

This review is from a non-techy perspective on the Canon PowerShot.  Please do read some of the other reviews for that from electronics experts.  I needed to get a camera that was...1. Really GOOD (Took Great Photos)2. Super Easy to Use3. Easily Portable.The Canon PowerShot SD1000 7.1MP meets all three of those criteria like a CHAMP.I carry it with me just about everywhere because I can it is such a PERFECT portable size.  So I have a small camera with me at the restaurant when I am with my cousins.  And I have a small camera with me when we visit Disneyland.  And the picture quality is excellent.  Again, I am not aiming for professional quality photographs.  But I did want excellent quality photographs.  My Canon totally delivers that.Where were you this past year where you were kicking yourself because you either didn't have a portable camera or where the quality of you camera (like the one on most digital phones) was poor?  Well, buy this camera, and end that happening again in the future.Because this is your portable digital camera, you will want to also purchase a protective case for it to avoid scratches and nicks.  Something like Kroo Camera Case for Canon Powershot Camera Digital Camera + Bonus Bundled with Universal LCD Screen Protector Kit + Cloth (Many Color Available) (Slim NylonPink) for the color options, Protective Case For CANON PowerShot Digital Cameras ***Includes Convenient Shoulder Strap & Mini Tripod*** which has both the case and cool mini-tripod for about the same price, or one of the spiffy leather cases like Canon PSC-55 Deluxe Leather Compact Case SD Series Digital Cameras.The one product \"drawback\" is that the Memory Card holds really only about 15 pix.  Which is fine for one evening out with your family.  However, when you are traveling for vacation or on a weekend wine country jaunt, you want the freedom to take LOTS of pix without having to run to your laptop and download them to clear some memory.  While you are ordering your Canon here, just add a more robust memory card (I bought two because I just NEVER wanted it to be an issue and they are super cheap.)

Also, I work as a photographer for a local newspaper and we constantly use high-end Canon SLRs and G series compact canons. Let me tell you that the quality of this little guy (the first Elph I've had) is impressive. Actually, I would say this is on top with the \"G\" and SLR series picture quality, if you know how to make a few adjustments.I've had the powershot SD1000 for 6 months, I've taken it to a few trips, parties, work events, and I carry it in my pocket every day. The features it has (like face detection, digital macro, time-lapse video, color accent, etc.), for the price, are fantastic. However, the best thing this camera offers, IMHO, is a quick operation. It takes VERY FAST pictures, and if you set the color to vivid, with a proper white balance, the images you get will surprise you. I recently had a trip to Cancun and took the camera with me. When I came back I wrote an article about my trip for the Sunday Magazine at my newspaper, and they used my pictures, as they looked very professional.If you're a casual photographer, you can't beat this price,  get it now.There's ONE thing, however, I still hope canon introduces in the future: a more practical video mode format.I'm not saying the video quality is bad. Actually it is the best I've seen in ultra-compacts. The thing is, that after having owned a Pentax Optio s5z for a year (before this one), which used good quality divx compression (much smaller files), I found myself taking many videos without worrying about remaining space in the memory card. The \"video thing\" started growing a lot on me. However, canon uses almost no compression in the AVI files and so, for each 1GB of memory, you can only record 8 minutes of video (2GB = only 16 minutes!).About the image stabilization: I don't miss it. If your hands are not very shaky and you use the proper ISO, you can overcome this. However, if you're using 1600 ISO, you will see \"grains\" unless you keep the picture to \"web sharing\" size. It's normal with compact cameras.My next camera will be (if it's still on sale) the SD750, because I recently found it has a 3 inch LCD, and I don't really use the viewfinder in SD1000 (a personal choice).Bottom line: for vacations, every day use, social snapshots, pets, the occasional \"artistic\" inspiration, fantastic response and pro-quality images at a very affordable price, you can't go wrong with this camera.", "Date": "May 20, 2008"}, {"Title": "Never been happier with a digital camera.", "Author": "Travis Richey \"Siv-Art Productions\"", "ReviewID": "R4XQI5JLF0BWM", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I got the SD1000 from amazon last June, and have never been more thrilled by a digital camera.  I've owned digitals since 1997, with a Canon, then an HP (I know, I know), and Casio, and now I've come back to the beginning.  I am a relatively poor actor living in LA, and so I was extremely picky about what I wanted in replacing my HP after it was stolen.  I really wanted initially to buy a sony cybershot, but it was a bit expensive, and I really have a problem with Sony's proprietary memory format.  The Canon SD1000 met all of my expectations and more.It's small, and easily fits in a pocket.  It's fast, has a good optical zoom, SD memory card use (I use a 2GB card) and rechargeable LiIon battery.It takes remarkable video for such a small device.  I'm part of a youtube documentary called Musecast, and have used the camera to film whole episodes on the go.  (search for \"musecast youtube gathering\" on youtube to see an example)It also has an amazing macro capability!  Sure it's been a few years since I've owned a new DC, but I've never had that before, and it's amazing!!  Plus, with almost no knowledge of how to do it properly, I've managed to take some awesome shots in very-low-light conditions.  I uploaded a sample of me in front of the LA skyline to show.It also has time-lapse video, which I've had a lot of fun with, and several fun filters like individual color enhancement.It also features a nice accelerometer which knows which way the camera is oriented and turns the image on the display so it's always right side up!I have absolutely no complaints about this camera.  I'm really trying right now to think of something, because I never trust reviews myself that are all positive like this...  I was initially concerned about the design, which I thought was pretty ugly and retro, but it's quite nice in practice, once you get it in your hands.  Oh!  ok.  if I had to complain about something, I'd say that the red-eye reduction is surprisingly poor.  Almost every picture I take with the flash (with the settings on automatic) requires me to fix the red-eye in iPhoto.  However, the camera itself has a red-eye removal tool!!I see that the price is way lower than it was a year ago.

The SD1000 was just the right size and that was the main reason I bought it.  To my great surprise I quickly fell in love with this little camera and my wife doesn't get that much chance to use it.  It's not a substitute for my DSLR, but it takes great pictures for its size and sure is handy to pack along.  I bought the matching Canon camera case and hang it on my belt whenever I think I might want to have a camera along -- it is small and unobtrusive and the magnetic catch on the cover makes it easy to pull out the camera and snap a one-handed shot at a moments notice (makes me feel like an old-West gunslinger!)  Another nice surprise is the video capability, which I wasn't even thinking about when I bought this.  I setup the programmable button to enable video recording and I find that I use that a lot.  It takes surprisingly good videos, and it's so simple and inconspicuous that I don't have to make a big production of it. (You can capture a lot of video on a 2GB card!)  Actually, even when I get out my DSLR and assorted lenses for \"serious\" photograpy, I almost always take the little guy along too.  It allows me to mix still pictures and videos, and when I've got a long lens on the DSLR, I can pop out the 1000 for a quick reasonably-wide-angle shot without worrying about changing lenses.  There are probably \"better\" general-purpose cameras, but I've had this little gem for over a year now and am still delighted with its tiny size and big capability.A postscript -- I'm currently in Vail and have been packing this camera along to take pictures while snowshoeing and skiing.  Not only is it really convenient, but the rest of my party has been amazed at the quality of the photos.  The detail, contrast, and color is great and rarely is there any reason for subsequent photoshop enhancement -- even in snow scenes.  The pictures I've been getting actually hold their own with the very expensive (and very heavy) professional style Canon DSLR used by one of the other folks on this trip, but I have mine with me all the time, whereas his mostly sits back at the lodge.

It's small enough that I keep it in my bag all the time, and it's an incredibly great camera to have with you for those random beautiful scenes that life occasionally throws at us. It takes incredible outdoor photos and decent indoor/poor lighting photos. As with all the Canon digitals I've used, the color is great and continues to impress me, even photos taken in totally dark rooms with the flash looked surprisingly nice. I usually skip the flash, simply because of the way flashes make people look- oily and bright- but this camera usually does just fine without it.I am very happy with the speed I can take photos- so many cameras in the sub-$200 range have a long lag. I'm not sure if it's the sensor or if the camera is waiting to write to flash, but this is a cheaper camera that is very fortunately free of that frustrating issue.Showing it to my mom, she got all excited and wanted a digicam of her own. My aunt bought her one for Christmas, a chunky point-and-shoot HP model that cost the same as what I paid for the SD1000.

The flash is not working for that mode!Third, the movie mode uses a raw format, and a 10-seconds clip gets 20Mb in size. This is ridiculous! Some other cameras like Samsung or Kodak have more efficient MPEG-4 format implemented for movies.Fourth, on the picture, the camera looks like made of metal. However, it's half metal, half white plastic, and the door for the battery/memory card is a very flimsy plastic thing. You should open and close it twice every two days on average when you recharge battery, and cross fingers it will not break.You cannot add date/time stamp on any picture size you take. Only in \"Postcard\" mode.Battery indicator shows up right before the battery dies.Other than that, the camera is great.", "Date": "November 4, 2007"}, {"Title": "Great Little Camera!", "Author": "Dana \"Nyteez.com\"", "ReviewID": "R3AK81Z9MYK773", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "After reading some of the reviews here I expected \"average indoor\" pictures.

Dattilo", "ReviewID": "R37Z6QDI0N15ZL", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "We had an early Nikon Coolpix camera and were looking for a new camera.  Specifically, we wanted a camera that was small enough to take around with us, took quick photos and had good quality.  The SD 1000 delivered on all of those and more.  Unlike our friends with SLRs, we can take our SD 1000 literally anywhere without feeling like it's too big to carry around or good out for a good photo shot.  The thing just fits right in your pocket and is very durable.  The thing we love about it is how quickly you can get a point and shoot.  From reaching into your pocket until taking a photo is just a few seconds.  And shot to shot time is very fast (we turn off the auto preview after each shot).  The photo quality is all you can ask for for a camera in this range.  Like most, it has a little trouble in dark conditions and the Flash produces red-eye most of the time.  Make sure you get an extra battery (we got 2 on eBay for $10) and a large, fast memory card (ours is 2GD at 120X and stores about 1000 images).  Overall, I can think there's a better value on the market than the SD 1000.  If you want a camera you can take anywhere that is fast and takes good pics, this is the one for you.

The SD1000 powers up FAST and is ready to take pictures in a split second so no more missed shots. I'm very happy with the image quality and overall features and value (especially good now that the price has dropped since I purchased mine about a month ago), all of which are covered well here by other reviewers so I'll only point out a few things I wish I had known before I made my purchase.It only comes with a 32Mb SD card so I recommend purchasing a 1 or 2 Gb card. I also recommend purchasing a second battery as a backup. My only significant complaint about this camera is that it doesn't provide a way for you to know what the battery level is. It only gives you a warning at the very end and you can maybe get around 6 more shots at that point. You can't just pop in AAAs to keep shooting so the backup battery is very important. After using this camera on my trip to Turkey, I sometimes think I should have invested in a Canon SD that had higher optical zoom. And I don't know if other models have a wider angle, but that would have been helpful to capture some of the tall monuments while still standing close to them. Some of the narrow streets or other obstacles prevented me from getting further away to get the shot I wanted. I didn't expect to use the video feature as much as I did, but I really enjoyed being able to capture dancers, musicians etc but I do wish I had purchased a Canon with image stabilization.

However, venture above ISO 200 and your pictures will become grainy and lose detail.  This is a consequence of pixel-packed sensors (many modern cameras with 14+ MP sensors are far worse!).  The lens provides a useful range, but 35mm on the wide end isn't terrific.  Canon makes PowerShots today with 28mm and even 24mm settings.  The aperture is a generous-for-the-size 2.8-4.9 variable across the zoom range.FeaturesI love the interface.  It's simple with no clutter and everything is where you want it.  The dedicated ISO button is a boon.  The LCD is bright and sharp with a good viewing angle.  One nice hidden feature is the ability to shoot up to fifteen second exposures.  I've produced some very nice night shots with this setting (although a tripod is needed).Closing StatementsI used the SD1000 as a daylight companion to my EOS 30D DSLR and it delivered at low ISOs.  I've recently sold it and traded up to the new PowerShot S90 which delivers superb, almost DSLR-like high ISO results.  That said, the SD1000 churned out consistent, beautiful images and never gave me any headaches.

Cameras with only a screen can be very difficult to use in bright sunlight, or so we thought at the time.  Nowadays, the screens are brighter and the technology has improved so that that is not so much of an issue as it used to be.  I find myself never looking through the viewfinder at all with this camera, because it is really tiny and because the screen is easy to see in pretty much any light.  The Kodak took incredible pictures for a little p&s; - bright colors, tack-sharp, and well exposed, often looking better than the ones I took with my Nikon D50.  The SD1000 got great reviews so we expected the same kind of performance.THE GOOD- small, extremely portable, easy to fit in your shirt pocket or even the front pocket of your jeans.  It's great for when you don't want to carry anything around but want to have a camera handy just in case.- Good quality video, including sound.  It's fun to take short videos, even at night, as long as you aren't expecting vidcam quality.  This is not something I was looking for when we bought it, but I'vebeen pleasantly surprised and started using the video function all the time.THE BAD- FOCUS!  We are so tired of having unsharp or blurry pictures come out of this camera, I've had to restrain my wife from throwing it off a cliff.  I don't know if it is an optical problem or a processing engine, but there are rarely sharp edges to any of the images from this camera.  The closer the subject, the worse it gets, although 10 feet shouldn't be too much to ask for a camera to focus on, should it?  I've seen similar examples of focus problems on othe SD cameras from flickr users.- Flash too bright.  On closeups the flash washes out all color.  The camera doesn't seem to adjust the flash intensity when the subject is close, and there's no way to do it manually.- Fragile lens.  This is actually the second SD1000 we've owned.  The first one lasted 2 months, because I got bumped in a crowd and the camera fell out of my hand while the lens was extended.  It landed softly on a pile of jackets, but when I picked it up the lens was bent 20 degrees and wouldn't retract.  Maybe it was a freak accident landing at the wrong angle, but it seems like it broke too easily.  My wife went and bought a second camera immediately so she could take it on a trip, and this one has lasted6 months so far with no problems, but has never been dropped either.- battery life - probably not any worse than the average p&s; that's packed with features, but it won't last through a full day of tourist snapshots.  Since it uses a special battery and not AAA's or some standard size, once the battery dies you're out of luck until you get back home and charge it up.Overall, this camera has been handy and the video feature has been fun.  But the lack of sharpness just leads to disapponting results when other similarly priced cameras take perfectly sharp images.  For that reason (and the fact that I have heard the same thing from other users), this will be the last SD series Canon I ever buy, despite how handy this thing is to carry around.", "Date": "November 2, 2008"}, {"Title": "Love it", "Author": "Hillary Cwiak", "ReviewID": "RXJ68PSRWVP0Y", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I've had my camera for a while now.

ONE exceptionally small device, fitting in my shirt pocket, is now both my primary camera and reliable video!!I use my Canon XT Rebel for more controlled shots and for 'artistic' input, as MANUAL CONTROLS on the SD 1000 are very limited. In MANUAL MODE you can set the ISO, but not f-stop nor shutter speed. But for a reliable and QUICK/RESPONSIVE 'point and shoot' pocket camera/video, the SD 1000 meets and exceeds all expectations I had for an 'under $200' price tag [I got it around $168 with FREE DELIVERY thru Amazon].", "Date": "June 16, 2008"}, {"Title": "User Friendly", "Author": "Victoria E.

My dad has a Sony cybershot and I thought this one wouldn't be as good because it was about $150 less. I was wrong! The video on this camera has sound, and zoom. The Sony has sound- no zoom. At first I thought this one didn't have sound and then it came to me... I had it on mute! A lot of people complained about no sound. I guess we were wrong. I take pictures on 12x zoom and they are very clear! I am amazed! The pictures are better then any I've ever seen from a digital and when people see my camera they are so surprised because it is tiny and slim. Pics are perfect, everything is. All shooting modes are great. Image stabilizer is not needed because they are always clear. Perfect camera! Don't spend twice as much on one that is ok, get one that is perfect! Buy this camera!

A shutterbug can enjoy this camera whether they're a long-time photographer, or someone who truly just points-and-shoots.However, this is a point-and-shoot camera, not a high-end DSLR.

Know that Canon compact camera shots do have a certain slight softness to them, but the reality is you just cannot have it all. I much prefer the portability.

When I wanted to buy a compact digital camera to offset the Digital SLR I own, the SD1000 seemed to be the logical choice.I can say that this has been one of the best purchases I have ever made. For a compact camera, this is simply stunning. Its not without some warts, but these are easily overlooked for the price.So... to the good:Picture quality is stunning, simply stunning. The new chip used produces great shot after great shot, the recycle time is great and and the new software in the camera makes framing a group shot dead simple.Low light performance is better than the SD450, but still not perfect. That said, this is a compact digital (and a sub-$200 7 megapixel at that) and the built-in flash does a nice job at filling in where needed.3x Optical Zoom is good enough for what it does, the digital zoom is next to useless however. Battery life is amazing for the size of the battery, but here is a niggle that I cannot begin to understand. Just like the SD450, the SD1000 does not have a battery meter. You get warned that the battery is getting low (by a Red symbol on the LCD) about 5-10 shots before the battery actually runs out. It would seem to be pretty simple to put a battery meter in the camera, so why not do it?Included software works well enough and its welcome to see that software for the Mac is included, although iPhoto finds the camera instantly and manipulates it perfectly.All in all, if you are looking for a high-quality compact digital camera that is dead simple to use, produces consistently great photos and fits in a shirt pocket, you cannot go wrong with the SD1000.", "Date": "March 8, 2008"}, {"Title": "Great pocket camera", "Author": "C.

The viewfinder is very handy in bright sunlight.  A review for this camera said that it is a camera that a professional photographer would take for quick pictures in the field.I took this on an 8 day cruise to Mexico, recently and took a few hundred shots (many with flash) and some videos.  This only downside is that it doesn't have auto stabilization and the optical zoom is 3x (12x with digital zoom)but the other features make this a great camera that is fun and easy to use.  It is so easy to change settings that I found myself taking multiple shots of the same scene/subject with the different settings to see which turned out best.

I still haven't resolved the software's failure to detect the camera.  A minor issue I think that Canon customer service will cure.Do not hesitate to purchase this.

Anytime there was alot of white or light color in the picture, the Canon almost blurred the light part of the picture.

And the optical view finder comes in handy when the reflection on the large LCD is too strong.

Small, Lightweight, Pocket Size  No excuse to not take it with you.  Excellent for travel.  Never miss a photo.2. Excellent Picture Quality  High resolution; can crop image and maintain detail.3. Real Image Viewfinder  Great for action shots e.g. panning kids sledding on a snow covered hill.  Viewfinder is great for photographing in bright sunlight when the LCD is difficult to see.  Camera is always more stable, less blur, when using viewfinder vs. LCD screen.Must Have Accessories:  Buy a 2 or 4 GB SD card.  Get a small, Samsonite zippered case ($ 8) to protect the camera while traveling with camera in your trouser or jacket pocket.Features You Have to Learn to Use:Auto setting for everyday photosNight setting for flash photos of people in low light buildings. If not set to Night, the background is dark/black = high contrast. Setting to Night lightens the background scenery = better contrastCM manual settings:  Set color to Positive Film for rich, saturated colors  Reduce exposure for sunsetsPortrait setting = soft effect for portraitsPhotostitch = essential for pictures of landscapes, wide buildings, etc.How to Zoom Beyond 3X Optical Zoom:  Don't use Digital Zoom.  Turn it off on the menu unless you want crappy, low resolution photos.  Instead, take very sharp, highest resolution photos.  For outdoor photos in bright light, use CM manual setting with ISO set to 80, and SuperFine, Large files.  This will produce the sharpest, highest resolution photo.  The jpg file is larger and sharper than you'll ever need.  Use software to \"zoom\" 2 or 3x by enlarging and cropping the photo.  It's like having a camera with a 6X optical zoom lens.Limitations:1. The major limitation is low light photography.  The camera sensor cannot collect enough light to take excellent pictures in low lighting such as in a cathedral.  The high ISO settings produce poor quality, very grainy pictures.  If you carry a tripod or monopod, you could overcome this limitation.  But who does that with a pocket camera?2) Flash is for relatively short distances, but it's good enough for family photos.3) The wrist strap has hard plastic sections.  The hard plastic can press against the LCD screen while the camera is in your pocket and permanently damage the screen.4) There is NO pocket-sized (credit card sized) documentation listing all the menu options, at least the frequently used settings.Conclusion:  Overall, it's an extremely powerful, low priced, extremely versatile camera packaged into a tiny, lightweight case.  It takes great photos.  You can't go wrong with this camera.  A slightly better camera with Image Stabilization for better, hand held, low-light photos is the new Powershot SD1100.  Image stabilization is a must have if you want to take photos in cathedrals, museums, etc.  I bought the SD1100 for my wife.", "Date": "August 3, 2008"}, {"Title": "Canon would not stand behind their product", "Author": "S.

I might try the case that's specifically for the SD1000, just because it would be that much more compact. To be honest, it bulges out little more than my ancient cell phone so it's not a problem carrying it around every time I go out with friends.I also purchased the Kingston, 4 GB SD Secure Digital Flash Memory Card SD/HC (Retail Package) because I work for a certain technology retailer and I got it for about $5 more than the 2 gig version with employee discount. 4 gigabytes is more than enough memory. Formatted, it holds just over 30 minutes of very impressive quality video (seems to hold more if you record shorter videos instead of one 30 minute video) and just over 2000 pictures at 3072 x 2304 resolution.Overall, more than pleased with this purchase.

The picture quality is decent, it is very simple to use and at the same time it's feature rich. The camera is very compact and sturdy, so it's perfect for casual active use.The built-in color effects are great and allow user to get black and white or \"older\" looking shots, or even select a single color to display and then the rest of the shot would be b&w.;The camera has pretty good battery life.The only con I can think of is the menu.

You can set the camera to flash no matter what, but a \"fill flah\" allows for a partial flash so faces aren't in the dark and you can still see the background (if lighting is behind the subject).If you used to use a older camera and you use a USB card reader, you may have to upgrade since these memory cards are the newer HD style.", "Date": "September 5, 2007"}, {"Title": "Delighted", "Author": "N.

Not because I didn't want to go to L.A. (the stories can't all be true, right?)---rather, I wanted to be able to take a lot of pictures while I was there, and I didn't have a suitable camera.I do have some cameras, but they were either too big and bulky, made it too difficult to get the images onto my computer, or took poor pictures. Obviously, during an extended trip, I needed something highly portable that had an easy and fast way to download the images and that took great pictures.My problem was resolved with the Canon PowerShot SD1000 digital camera. Since I have been using it almost daily here in Los Angeles, I have found it to be one of the best cameras I have ever used.First, the camera has a convenient and functional shape that is easily portable. Basically the camera is like the shape of a small deck of cards. The lense extends when in use, but otherwise sits protected within the camera case. Some of the other cameras I saw had strange curves or awkward protrusions that would only cause trouble when on travel.Second, loading pictures onto my computer is trivial---I just attach the cable from the camera to my laptop and with one button press all of the new images are transferred over.Third, the camera takes great pictures. In fact, all of the pictures taken of Los Angeles in the various blog postings on this website were taken with this camera. For example, here are some pictures I took on a recent trip to the Getty Museum.And note --- I have no photography experience, so these pictures were me just pointing and clicking. For the experienced photographer, there are many, many features in this camera to allow almost complete customization of the picture taking process. With me, for now, just pointing and clicking works well.For some of the technical specifications, it has a 7.1 megapixel CCD that captures enough detail for photo-quality 15x20\" prints. You can use the view-finder or the 2.5\" LCD to compose your shots. It also has something like 17 shooting modes, face detection, high ISO settings, 8 special scene modes, red-eye correction, 3x optical zoom, and a number of other features.After adding a 4GB SD card, I've been completely happy with this camera.(review by Kendall Giles)", "Date": "March 1, 2009"}, {"Title": "A Perfect Companion to a DSLR on Trips", "Author": "Lydia T.", "ReviewID": "R2XTE8JKQS70T", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I bought this camera a year ago, thought I'd return it once I got my DSLR in a few days.

Larger MP beyond 7.1 won't make any differences unless you want to blow up the image to a wall size, and the Image Stabilized feature doesn't sell for me: you either take pictures with your hands holding the camera or with a tripod.I like this camera because of:--its aesthetic approach to the design: clean, angular, minimalist and classic--its metal body: solid, smooth and pleasing to the touch--its capacity of getting pictures in low light without flash (I always like to turn off the flash to get better images, like things in museums,  in shop windows, or in dimly lit streets, or in drizzles when you don't want to damage your DSLR lenses.)--its friendliness: always ready at any moment, easy to change ISO or exposure options (sometimes I simply point it to the sky, half press the shutter button and aim at the desired image for an instant underexposed picture without changing anything), and functions well in moving vehicles (I have taken tons of pictures through windows on moving buses and trains, you can't imagine what kind of happy surprises you'll get--like a blurry bush foreground with a still sharp object in the distance; if you maneuver the camera angle a bit you'll avoid window reflection entirely.  A DSLR won't allow you such speed, when you get it ready, the image will be gone in less than a second.)--its value has increased, to my surprise; the price of this camera is almost doubled now since I bought it; there must be some reasons for it, usually electronic stuff decreases in market value over the time.  To me it really doesn't matter, I'll keep it and won't exchange it for any of the newer models, simply, its overall size, features and design combination hasn't been surpassed yet.", "Date": "February 21, 2009"}, {"Title": "Absolutely everything I wanted", "Author": "I Want to Be Bob Dylan \"Emily\"", "ReviewID": "R2SA7HYA1UIDHS", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I'm not a professional photographer, but just your average college student.  I love to travel, and I love taking lots of pictures at concerts, parties, etc.  I had an hp camera from forever ago as my last digital, and the quality of this camera comparatively is absolutely incredible.  I have the black one (easier to keep finger prints off of), and I love the size.  The optical zoom is very nice, and the digital zoom after that is at least passable.  The display is large, and I love that the battery is rechargeable.  (It can take up to an hour and a half, I believe, before it's fully charged, so be ready for that.)  The video is so high quality I decided I didn't need a camcorder.  Also, the video has no time limit.I don't go looking for \"cool\" features on my camera, but every once in a while, I am surprised by some that I find... I haven't quite found a program to put the pictures together yet, but it has a panoramic function, which I think is just so cool, and the video functions are great, too, including the time laps, which is really fun to play around with.Basically,there are so many options with this camera that it will always spark your creativity!", "Date": "February 9, 2009"}, {"Title": "Overall, this is a great little camera...", "Author": "Junebug75", "ReviewID": "RRV6AR1GL5JSF", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I have thoroughly enjoyed my little elf and have taken some fabulous shots with it, but now that I want to take more professional type pictures, this camera just doesn't cut it.It's a wonderful little camera for general snapshots and it offers many pre-programmed modes such as kids & pets, fireworks, digital macro, snow, beach, underwater, aquarium, etc, which make it easy to use for beginners. Overall, it's been great camera to start out with, but as I learn more about photography I realize I need to upgrade for my personal needs. Here's my pros & cons:Pros:Compact size.  It fits easily into a pocket, small handbag, or the atrocious fanny-pack that some people wear.The digital macro setting is fabulous! I have not been disappointed with a single picture I have taken with this setting.The menu button displays all of the various settings you can choose from so it's easy to quickly swap between settings.It takes great pictures in outdoor settings (during the day).It takes great pictures indoors IF there is ample natural light in the room.Cons:Indoor pictures taken in low light are less than desirable.I have had a major problem with red-eye (indoors) when the flash is used. There is a red-eye reduction setting built into the camera, and you can also correct red-eye right on the camera after the picture is taken, but for many of my red-eye problems, neither of these options seemed to help a bit.The camera shake warning is useful when using the camera hand-held, but I'm not sure how accurate it is. The warning appears nearly every time I zoom in on a subject and I've even gotten the warning when my camera was on a tripod. It gets annoying after a while.I have taken some really great pictures with this camera, but a lot of times in order to get 10 great pictures I have to take about a hundred or so shots. A major problem here is that the LCD screen (in review mode) shows the picture to be satisfactory when I take it, but when it's in larger view on my PC I realize that it's blurry or grainy.And don't even think about looking at the LCD screen when you're outdoors on a sunny day. You can't see it.I realize that many of my disappointments with this camera could be personal error in using its functions properly as I was learning. Overall, I have been pleased with this camera as a learning tool. I would recommend it to anyone whose desire is to have a compact camera that enables them to take snapshots at any given moment or is looking for a reasonably priced point & shoot camera in order to learn the ropes before moving on to a DSLR.", "Date": "February 5, 2009"}, {"Title": "Average Camera", "Author": "Carmen Guillen-casal", "ReviewID": "RNR18O5RCKCE5", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "I have been an avid Canon user for some years now, and was hoping to find a small, budget Canon camera that I could carry around and take casual pictures with. Luckily, I haven't had any problems with the lens jamming - but I'm somewhat disappointed by the picture quality. It seems no matter what light, the pictures are grainier than what I was hoping the camera would deliver. Not surprisingly, this issue is exacerbated by low lighting.As far as size, the camera fits perfectly into any pocket, and is fairly lightweight. I love the LCD response to turning the camera - though I find that I have to give the camera a light tap sometimes to remind it to flip an image in a given direction.I don't regret purchasing the camera entirely, I just really wish the picture quality was a bit better.", "Date": "January 28, 2009"}, {"Title": "good camera for basic needs, party pics", "Author": "Rami Bitar \"party goer\"", "ReviewID": "R1ZSAC5REH0DC0", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I bought this camera on the recommendation that canon is a strong brand for digital cameras, and from reading several strong user reviews.  I also primarily take photos for social purposes when out partying, so I would preface by saying don't buy this camera if you're trying to impress your professional photographer buddies.Most point-and-shoot cameras these days market the number of megapixels, but there is more to image quality than the digital resolution.  Specifically, I find that most compact and ultra-compact cameras have good image quality during the day and try to differentiate on low light performance.  For night photos, I found that images tend to be grainy and have have poor balance of image brightness and contrast.  Red eye at night is also a problem although some software packages can auto correct this.  Most digital cameras at this price have the same issue, by the way.This camera is easy to use, but I found the  menu system to be overly complex with multiple navigation modes and unintuitive menu choices. All cameras I've used suffer from this complexity, so nothing new here.I also appreciate having movie mode as an option but you might be better off with a flip HD recorder if you plan to frequently capture video.Overall, I would agree with other reviewers that this camera is easy to use, at a good price point, and will meet the needs of your average user and party-goer.  So don't hesitate buying this one if you're not sure what to get.On a side note, you might also want to consider the Lumex brand cameras that have a default wide-angle lens really creates more compelling group shots.Hope this helps and happy shopping.", "Date": "January 27, 2009"}, {"Title": "Great little Happy Snaps Camera", "Author": "Diana Crockett \"Crazy Collager\"", "ReviewID": "R139FME1URBBEJ", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Well I know this is not the most recent model of Canon PowerShot but I sure love it...and if I were going to replace this camera I would purchase the newest one!

The camera body has a square bottom and a very well balanced center of gravity. That means you can take self-timer pictures by balancing the camera on a rock, car hood, or fence post. That is in case you forgot or didn't want to carry a tripod.Many other cameras (Casio and Sony come to mind) have a rounded or irregular bottom or a tendency to topple in one direction, which means you have to carry a small tripod in your other pocket at all times if you're planning to take self-pictures using the timer.

Ive owned a lot of digital cameras. everything from minolta SLR to Kodak to Canon. Canon is by far superior to most other camera companies on the market and up to par with a few others.the great thing about this camera is that it is very compact. It can fit in any purse or just be carried and it doesnt feel like a burden or bulky in any form.it has so many functions for every type of situation and the manual mode is great too. it really is a fully functional camera and has pretty much every feature you could ever need in an ultra compact. the face detection is really nice as well.I did notice that sometimes the flash seems really overbearing on pictures when looking on the LCD but as soon as you upload your images it turns out the flash wasnt as harsh as it had looked in the first place.I love this camera and bring it everywhere with me. I even got my boyfriend wanting one for when he goes on trips.Ive spent sometimes $300 at a time on a digital camera but have never had one as good as this and at such a cheap price of $159.99 although i noticed the silver price went up and now the black is $159.99 last i checked but its worth the $160 for a great camera!!I suggest getting a case for all cameras, but the one that canon made specifically for this camera sucks. so I wouldnt recommend that case. the problem is you cant fit the strap through the hole provided on the case and additionally the flap that is magnetic doesnt close when you have the camera in the case.", "Date": "May 31, 2008"}, {"Title": "Canon SD 1000", "Author": "Paul L.

Both are 7.1 MP, similar sizes and when I first got the cameras I actually preferred the Kodak even though it was the less expensive.  The one thing I didn't care for with the Canon was that when you zoom in on something it doesn't always come in clear on the screen, but the pictures are very sharp and clear when taken.  The Kodak is extremely easy to use, the reason I had bought it for my parents.  However, after having the Canon for a few months now I am SO happy I kept it!  Not only is the size of the camera fantastic, easy enough to slip into a pocket to take anywhere, but the photos we are getting are outstanding!  I recently attended an outdoor wedding and took some great shots one handed, zooming in with only one hand as well.  Everyone was impressed with the photos and couldn't believe how nice the camera zoomed in and yet the pictures were clear and sharp.  We've taken many indoor pictures as well and find the red eye isn't bad at all, nothing like an Olympus I used to use that had a red eye reduction feature but didn't seem to do much even when used.  The Canon Sure Shot has many features that I'm sure we will never use but it is nice to have the capability there if we choose to do so.  It has more settings to use for your photos than any camera I've ever used, including one for taking shots of aquariums that I used and I couldn't believe how it brought the fish and plants into an almost 3d look on the picture. We'll be going on vacation in only a couple weeks to Las Vegas and Utah's Zion National Park and Bryce Canyon and I'm excited to have this camera to use there as I think we will get some outstanding pictures.  Incidentally, my 11 year old daughter uses the camera quite a lot and has taken pictures you would never believe an 11 year old had taken they were so good.

This was for the most part when I was taking photos outside in the sun, but I also got good results indoors with no flash.  Cut to my first efforts with the Elph and everything is SUPER GRAINY, *especially* any pictures taken in black and white (one of my favorite ways of taking pictures).Even photos taken with the flash sometimes suffer from excessive graininess, and that's pretty frustrating coming from having owned a previous camera that captured things in such beautiful, clear detail.

I thus retract it with this one.Bought this camera for my daughter based on the reviews here at Amazon.  This is a great little camera!!  I hardly ever take out my bulky 3.2 MP Olympus when this thing is around. Takes great pictures and is very user friendly.  As a typical guy, I was able to figure out most things without even reading the manual.

So, this search for a \"better\", more \"expensive\" model, has lead me to researching many sites and models. Not one to actually read a manual for cameras that are intuitive, I barely glanced at this one when we first got it about a year ago. But boy, the things it can do! Now that I see features being offered in cameras in the $250-$350 range, that this Elph has, it's making me wonder if i really do need to spend more for something I already have.The other models i'm currently looking at are (in no particular order):Canon PowerShot G9 12.1MP Digital Camera with 6x Optical Image Stabilized Zoom $439.77Panasonic Lumix DMC-FZ18S 8.1MP Digital Camera with 18x Wide Angle MEGA Optical Image Stabilized Zoom (Silver)$299.98Canon PowerShot A590IS 8MP Digital Camera with 4x Optical Image Stabilized Zoom around $150Canon PowerShot Pro Series S5 IS 8.0MP Digital Camera with 12x Optical Image Stabilized Zoom $314I'd like something that isn't going to be super bulky/heavy that it's a pain to carry, decent auto/manual offerings, and high enough resolution to blow up images to poster size, 16\" x 20\" or so. Even though this camera has so far taken amazing shots, I thought it was on a very high quality setting. So when i saw pixels on magnification, i thought I need a better one. Turns out it was only on the lowest of the medium settings!! Glad i saw the manual now.There is the typical lag time waiting between shots, but I have yet to try it's Continuous Shots feature, which works on a lower level setting.

But, let me add my two cents.While the digital zoom may be a farce to many, let me tell you that the \"Digital Macro\" setting is not!  You can get amazingly and eerily close to little flowers and such with stunning clarity.  I mean like professional results type pictures.I encourage anyone to experiment with this setting no matter which elph camera you get.  You'll be totally impressed at a whole other tiny world right in front of you.TIPS:1) Keep the ISO setting at 80 or 100 when in digital macro mode.  This forces the camera to choose to keep the f-stop low (f2.8-f4.5)and the lens wide open for MAXIMUM resolution,clarity, and depth-of-field.2) Keep the metering on \"Center Weighted\" [ ].  Spot Metering, [o],doesn't work as well for this venue.3) I also like the the \"Vivid\" setting in \"My Colors\" to make my little subjects' photos \"pop\".  Naturally, keep the camera on \"Superfine\" and Large (3072x2304).4) You can get the camera's lens closer than you think and still get the camera to auto-focus........I mean like 1-2 inches close!5)Push the Menu button and set the AiAF to \"off\".  Set the Auto ISO Shift to \"off also because you don't want the camera automatically choosing a higher ISO and causing you to lose resolution.  Set the AF-assist beam to \"off\" because, in \"Digital Macro\", you're so close to your subject the beam is useless and causes fuzzy focusing.6) You can get better results with a tripod stablizing the camera.7) Set the shutter timer to \"2 sec\" with your camera on a tripod and then step back and let camera do the work.  This is only good with a tripod.  If you're hand holding just be steady and gently push the shutter.8) After you're done shooting.  Connect the camera to the TV with the supplied cable.  Put the camera on \"slide show\" and sit back and watch you wife's jaw drop open when she sees your work.Hope this helps inspire you to use \"Digital Macro\"! Don't worry if you don't understand a thing I'm saying.  Sit down with the camera's manual, print this review, and work it through.  You can do this!  It's worth the effort and you'll have a whole new sub-hobby.  You'll be infatuated....especially if your wife has a lot of flowers for subject to shoot.

Why all the bad reviews?", "Author": "Jace E. Mouse", "ReviewID": "R11H5QJAVL4Y6", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This was an upgrade to an earlier Elph model which - after years of abuse and neglect - finally stopped working.  I also have a digital SLR and would consider myself to be an advanced amateur photographer.Image Quality is very good.  Based on other reviews, I almost didn't buy this camera.  The reviews sounded like this would be a step backward, but that certainly hasn't been my experience.  The quality is every bit as good as other camera's I've used - better when you consider the megapixel count.  The quality is not as good as my DSLR, but that camera and lens cost over $2000!  If my DSLR is a 10, I'd say this is at least an eight.  Tips for better results:- I adjusted the ISO setting.  The camera comes pre-set to automatically adjust ISO.  As a result, it will allow you to take grainy high ISO pictures at times when the camera really ought to tell you to turn on lights or use a flash instead.  I set my camera so that I usually shoot on ISO 80, and never above ISO 200.  This will dramatically cut-down on the \"noise\" seen in the photos.  I only go above 200 when it's dark in the room, the subjects are moving around, and I can't turn on the lights or use a flash.  In reality, that's a pretty uncommon scenario.- I view the photos at the size they're meant to be seen - where they take of the full screen, or smaller.  I wonder how many of the disappointed reviewers are simply looking at the images fully \"blown up\" and are therefore disappointed.  The photography pros call this \"pixel peeping.\"- I turn off \"digital zoom.\"  This is just a marketing gimmick.  You get closer to the subject  by cropping off megapixels and (to make it worse) then blowing-up the image to fit the original size, so it significantly impacts image quality.Features to love:- The start-up time is fantastic.  No more missed shots.- Movie mode.  This camera offers a larger size and better frame rate than most on the market.  It's great for those times when we don't want to lug the video camera around.- The \"vivid\" color setting is nice way to add some visual \"punch\" to my photos, without taking the time to edit them in Photoshop.", "Date": "March 13, 2008"}, {"Title": "SD1000 Canon Powershot Digital Camera", "Author": "jrp", "ReviewID": "R11IEL2WRPV4QX", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "WE have been using this Camera for about a year now and it was a very good buy it works great And even I can take a good picture .", "Date": "March 10, 2008"}, {"Title": "Canon SD1000 Digital Camera", "Author": "jed", "ReviewID": "R1DTDN58P7FZ0", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I bought this camera for my Grandson and he is enjoying it along with all the features.", "Date": "March 10, 2008"}, {"Title": "wow!

I could have fixed it but it would have cost some money to get it in there and the chances that I was about to save it was unlikely! It was so small and just hanging on there.  After the spring was gone it would never shut completely AND the real problem was occasionally it wouldn't open all the way and the shutter would be in the way of the picture... But atleast half the time it would open eventually and would take wonderful beautiful crisp pictures.  Some people say that their pictures in low light indoors are bad but I haven't really ever had that problem. I took many pictures in low light (they were mostly in black and white) but they all turned out wonderful.I also love that the flash isn't too harsh. It's more natural than most other brands. It also reached everything from upclose (5 feet say) to like 5 feet further back (10 feet) with practically the same amount of light I did also occasionally have the rare problem of it's focus being a little off. But it still created beautiful pictures because I love abstract art and often that might have been what I was going for. (I loved that I could change the focus as well so that I could create that blurred effect). If there was superb lighting then no matter what I'd get a good picture. And there was a chance that action shots were clear! (they were always clear if i used the flash)I loved this camera so much. But I'm pretty sure, with such quality pictures there is no way a point and shoot camera will ever be that easy... You have to work a little but with this camera barely any.

Our first Canon, the venerable Powershot G1, lasted us many, many years.  It was relegated to backup status in late 2006 when we purchased a Digital Rebel XTi.Canon Digital Rebel XTi 10.1MP Digital SLR Camera (Black Body Only)  Eventually, though, it gave out, and we needed a replacement.  We wanted something that was small and ultra-portable for times when we just didn't want the bulk of the XTi.Enter the SD1000.  The size and weight allow it to be carried in practially any pocket.  Within the size, though, is a wealth of features.  Overall we have been very impressed.I won't enter a lengthy discussion about all of its features or shortcomings, because I feel that they have been adequately addressed in other reviews.  I also won't enter a lengthy discussion of shortcomings it has over DSLR or other higher-class cameras, because those cameras are a completely different class and bring with them different capabilities.  I will comment on a few of the features that stand out (for better or for worse):- LCD display.  It is bright and readable, and the menu system is very like the system used in every Canon camera.  Some reviews have commented that they find it cumbersome, but we were right at home with it.  It would be nice if it had a tilt-and-pan LCD, but I woulnd't expect it for something so tiny.- Face detection.  This is very slick, and works very well.  For many of the modes, the camera will find and track faces in the photo to use for metering and focusing.  A nice feature that most DSLRs don't even have.- Video capture.  This is a feature that was poor to adequate on the G1 (it was great for the age in which it was developed), but on this little camera, it is fantastic.  The frame rate is such that the movies are very high quality, and they can be shot at many resolutions to control the file size.  Given how well it does, there are many situations for which we would not even use our digital camcorder any more.  Very impressed.Overall, we really like the camera, and for the price point are still impressed with the quality and features.", "Date": "February 24, 2008"}, {"Title": "This is a keeper", "Author": "Michael McKee \"mystic cowboy\"", "ReviewID": "R2CFORDEG56MJB", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I am addicted to picture taking and  was looking for a camera that I could always have with me. I bought and returned a Nikon Coolpix S200 before finding this one. I'm glad I did. This is a keeper. It's light, quick to start, has adequate picture taking modes, takes okay movies and allows me to make voice memos.My first time out with it I had left the ISO to the factory standard of auto and the camera made some strange exposure choices. On a bright and sunny day it set the ISO at 350 and the shutter speed at 1/1200 of a second. I was shooting a dry docked boat and didn't need to stop any action. I took a bit over 100 images during that outing and three others came out with similar strange combinations of ISO, focal length and shutter speed. Those were noticeably grainy.After setting the ISO to 100, the camera has taken consistently crisp and clear photos. Canon offers an ISO of 1000 for this camera but that's so grainy that I'd only use it in an emergency. 200 has a little bit of grain and any ISO higher than that degrades quickly. However, for this price range I doubt there is anything better.The macro mode works well. The menus are mostly set up in a logical manner and quick to access. I'm old enough to still want an optical viewfinder, which this has but few other cameras in this category offer. The scene modes seem adequate for my needs. Colors are the tiniest bit over saturated but I imagine that most people who buy this camera appreciate the vivid color.The digital image stabilization doesn't compare to the optical stabilization on my DSLR but seems to help a little bit. I photographed some displays at an indoor garden show with available light at ISO 200 and got some reasonably sharp images, clear enough for reference at any rate.I don't bother with in-camera viewing, color modes or editing and don't print directly from the camera so can't comment on those features. Memory cards are cheap so I just take lots of images and work with them on my computer.The included photo stitch software is extremely ugly and clunky to use but does do a nice job of creating panoramas. They blend seamlessly.  An added bonus is that it can save the composites to Quicktime VR movies, which is a nice option.

In this day of the devalued dollar, the going price is still almost as small as the dimensions of the SD1000.  If it's your first camera, or your first in 4-5 years, give this one, along with the slightly higher-priced but more user-friendly, larger-screened SD750, a good look.  But if you already have an SD600, no need to make a switch yet.  DigiImageProcessor3 offers an additional bell or whistle or two but not necessarily higher resolution photos. (Take a look at the resolutions rendered by various cameras at a site like Steve's Digicams.)  Also, with each improvement there are trade-offs (Cnet's specs even give the advantage to the SD600 in the category of continuous shooting speed).The auto facial-heightening feature of the SD1000 is, on the whole, an impressive addition, but not foolproof.  If that's a primary consideration, the consumer may as well go to the new Sony DSC200, programmed to shoot only when the lens sees a smiling face. (Next, look for both Canon and Sony to come out with bright pink and orange models with built-in audio speakers delivering jokes to insure the subject's mouth forms an upward crescent sufficiently curved to trigger the auto smile-sensoring shutter.)Once a musician has a good instrument, he's foolish to think that next year's model will make him a better player.  If you're satisfied with your present camera, Canon or otherwise, devote your time to learning the camera and how to take better pictures with it.  It's merely an instrument: it doesn't play itself.  The photographer takes the pictures, not the camera.  The same is as true of the SD1000 as of earlier Canon models.  The best reason, eventually, to make a switch will be the realization that nothing less than an SLR model like the Canon Rebel series will accomplish the creative compositions and striking representations you now wish to create with a camera.", "Date": "November 26, 2007"}, {"Title": "AWESOME!!", "Author": "A.

I stuck with Canon because 1) I already know how the cameras work and 2) I didn't want to fuss with installing additional drivers or software.  It isn't the best camera out there, but considering the hundred-something dollar price tag, you do get a pretty good bang for your buck.  In my experience, it hasn't disappointed and I certainly consider it to be worth the money.This camera fits nicely in pretty much any pocket, and the large screen makes framing your shots easy. (In fact, the screen is considerably larger than either of my fancier cameras.)My only complaint is with the flash settings--there is no \"on\" setting, just \"off\" and \"auto.\"  Thus, getting good shots when there is a lot of back lighting is difficult.Otherwise, it's a great compact camera for everyday use.  It takes clean, crisp photos in most situations.  The 3X optical zoom works nicely; the 12X digital zoom isn't spectacular, but if I'm going for detail I would probably be using one of my better cameras anyway.I haven't played with the video feature much, other than to try it out and make sure it works, but my impression is that it is pretty clear as well.  The volume seems to be generally lower than my S2, but otherwise no complaints thus far.Other posts have gone into great detail regarding the features and capabilities of the camera in comparison to other models.  I'm far from an expert in photography, so I will leave those parts up to them.  If you're particularly picky about specific features, this might not be the best camera for you.

I kept turning it on and off, same result each time. So I went to the internet to research this, and found other people had the same problem with this camera! After reading a lot of comments on many websites, I decided the best advice was to smack it with my hands to try and get the gears to realign. I did that and it worked! Although it made a little more of a grinding sound as the lens came out. It took a few days of having to smack it every once in awhile before it finally quit giving me trouble. It still works, but sometimes my photos are a little more blurry, so then I have to shut it off and turn it back on. I would no longer give this camera five stars. There was nothing that happened to it before it started acting up, which is what happened to a lot of other people.

The Canon SD1000 sold for as little as $150 before it was discontinued, but now \"new old stock\" SD1000 cameras sell for $500 and used ones in excellent condition sell for $300 and up.  Why?The SD1000 is about the size of a pack of cards.  That means it is easy to carry with you.  Mine has been in a padded case clipped to my belt for about 25 days a month for the past two years.  And, it is a simple camera.  I \"lock\" mine to ISO 100, and have dialed in my favorite settings for color, sharpness, contrast, and ISO.  That enables me to simply pull the camera from its case and start taking photos. By pre-focusing, the SD1000 provides instant shutter release, which enables taking sharp handheld photos at very slow shutter speeds.The 8 x 10 enlargements I've made from photos taken outdoors in good light are equal in quality to photos I've taken with professional level cameras and lenses.  Enlarged prints from SD1000 look very much like prints from a very good Canon film camera from the 1970 to 1995 era, and SD1000 photos do not have the artificial \"digitized\" look of prints made by many digital cameras.As with any camera with a tiny flash, getting good results indoors requires getting in close, three to five feet from the primary subject.  Having good room lights and being near a window helps.  But, a tiny flash will never produce great photos.Digital cameras, no matter how well made, are VERY delicate.  They need to be kept dry, away from humidity and moisture, and in moderate temperatures of around 50 degrees to 80 degrees.  Folks put their cameras in the glove box of their car (where temperatures soar to over 100 degrees on a sunny day) and wonder why the camera no longer works.  I \"baby\" my SD1000.  I won't put it in a jean's pocket where the lens drive mechanism might be damaged.  I keep it in a well padded case and keep it in \"review\" mode so that the lens barrel does not accidentally attempt to open while the camera is in the case.As of June 2012, my SD1000 is still going strong.

The line started with a film camera, though the company's SD line of digital compacts still carries the Digital Elph moniker. Despite its four-digit number, Canon positions the PowerShot SD1000 as a replacement for last year's SD600, which also puts it below the new SD750 in the company's line. Resolution has been bumped up to 7.1 megapixels from the SD600's 6MP, but despite an almost identical controls layout (though different cosmetic design), Canon made a few changes on the inside.The most noticeable internal change is the switch to the new Digic III processor. Canon says it enables longer battery life, faster startup, autofocus, and shutter response (we call this shutter lag). Plus, the processor adds enough number-crunching power to add face detection, red-eye reduction (in playback mode), and lets the SD1000 reach further heights of sensitivity--in this case ISO 1600. To Canon's credit, we did see some performance improvements over the SD600 (see our performance paragraph below for more).While cosmetic differences abound, the SD600 and SD1000 actually have very similar control layouts. Canon places all buttons on the right half of the body. A slider lets you switch between still image capture, video recording, and playback. Other than three dedicated buttons, for Menu, Display, and Direct Printing, the only other control is the circular four-way rocker with a Function/Set button in the middle. We found the four-way rocker somewhat difficult to use. Since it's recessed and the rocker's ring isn't all that wide, on a number of occasions we hit the Function/Set button when we meant to hit the rocker.The SD1000's new cosmetic look harkens back to the original Elph with the big black circle around its lens, but drew mixed reactions from the people to whom we showed our sample. Some were turned off by the overall boxy shape, though just as many admired the tiny, simple shape. Likewise, about half felt the look was too retro, while the other half admired the throwback design. If you don't like the black-on-silver design, Canon also offers a silver-on-silver version.To date, Canon hasn't seen fit to include manual exposure controls in any of the cameras in the Digital Elph line, and the SD1000 continues this trend. On one level, it makes sense, since the target audience for these compacts is snapshooters who often don't know an f-stop from a shutter speed. While we can't hold this against Canon (its competitors do the same thing), with more and more pros and advanced shooters looking for pocketable back-up cameras, it might be time to broaden the scope of these models. Fourteen scene modes help you tackle specific situations, such as portraits, fireworks, and snowy scenes. Some of these appear in the main function menu, but Canon makes you press the menu button again to see them all. In addition to scene modes, there's also a full auto mode, as well as a mode marked manual, which lets you choose certain options, such as exposure compensation, white balance, and metering mode (evaluative, center weighted, or spot).Covering an equivalent range of 35mm to 105mm, with a maximum aperture range of f/2.8 to f/4.9, this camera's 3X optical zoom lens is on par with the competition. However, we saw very little colored fringing in our test images, which leads us to believe it probably has higher quality glass than some compacts. The 2.5-inch LCD screen has a special coating intended to prevent glare, scratches, and fingerprints. We saw very little glare, but plenty of fingerprints. Thankfully, these were easily wiped away, though you'll probably want to carry a small microfiber cloth with you if smudges bother you. We were pleased to see that Canon still includes an optical viewfinder. Even if it is tiny and tunnel-like, it'll still come in handy in those situations when you've got your back to the wall, or you don't want the light from the LCD to bother others.Performance was relatively speedy in our tests. The PowerShot SD1000 took 0.98 second to start up and capture its first JPEG. Subsequent JPEGs took 1.48 seconds between shots with the flash turned off and 2.44 seconds with the flash enabled. Shutter lag measured 0.45 second in our high-contrast test, which mimics bright shooting conditions, and 0.9 second in our low-contrast test, which mimics dim shooting conditions. Continuous shooting wasn't quite as fast as its 6MP predecessor. We measured approximately 1.7 frames per second regardless of image size. Canon's face detection system quickly and accurately detected most of the faces we tried. It seems to rely largely on eyes, as it got slightly confused when one of our lovely models closed hers.Image quality from the PowerShot SD1000 was excellent in our tests, with accurate colors and plenty of sharpness. The camera's automatic white balance yielded slightly yellowish images with our test lab's Tungsten lights, though the Tungsten white balance preset compensated, producing very neutral colors. Canon keeps noise well under control from ISO 80 through ISO 200, though the company's noise reduction algorithms seem to pull out a minute amount of sharpness at ISO 200. At ISO 400 noise becomes more apparent, manifesting as a light covering of mostly bluish, off-color speckles. ISO 800 brings significantly more noise, though images may be usable for smaller prints (4x6 inch). However, a large amount of sharpness, along with a hefty amount of shadow detail is lost at this setting. ISO 1600 looks like shooting in a snow storm. At this top setting, sharpness becomes a distant fantasy and shadow detail rescinds into another inaccessible dimension. We suggest staying below ISO 800 whenever possible and don't suggest using ISO 1600 at all. Of course, that still puts this camera on par, or better, compared with its competition in terms of ISO noise.Despite our minor gripes, the PowerShot SD1000 is a top-notch compact camera for its price range. Most users will be pleased with its excellent image quality and the useful, if not extensive, feature set. The most significant feature you won't find here is optical image stabilization, though at this price, you'd be hard pressed to find it elsewhere while maintaining a decent level of image quality at the same time.", "Date": "July 21, 2007"}, {"Title": "Beautiful photos", "Author": "Bargain shopper \"momw4kids\"", "ReviewID": "R15A2GQ8EN0DE6", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This camera has great performance for it's size.

Mattson", "ReviewID": "R1UPAWYMR71RTX", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I bought this camera about a year ago. I live in the US in a very scenic area. I've used this camera for photographing people, wildlife, and scenery. Yesterday, I was out getting some area shots for a scrapbook I'm working on and as an aside played with some of the features I hadn't used much before.Some wildlife showed up that I was able to get some great shots of, a great blue heron, a doe and her fawn, then the doe running when her baby went out of sight. I have so many pictures of the heron that I don't really need all of them which will make it difficult to decide how many and which ones to print.I tend to use it mostly in auto mode but have begun to experiment. Yesterday I experimented with the mode which takes one photo right after another. It worked great and enabled me to photograph a man learning to hang glide as the parachute looking glider went from flat on the ground to airborn and the man going over the bluff to the field below.My camera said there were 400 pictures on it yesterday when I downloaded the photos to my computer. Most of those were from yesterday. I had charged up the battery the other day and it died on me yesterday so I had to quit taking pictures. That's the first time I've had that happen. Before I've always charged it up when I figured it needed it. Unfortunately I didn't have a back up battery. I have 3 coming that I ordered today.One thing I really like about this camera is that it takes SD memory which is widely available, available in a range of memory, and can often be found on sale at various stores. My other digital camera has memory that is brand specific.This is my third digital camera. The first came free when we bought a printer. The second one was much nicer but this Canon camera is much more compact. I carry it around in my purse so I can take a photo at a moment's notice.Within the last couple of weeks I've taken probably close to 1,000 photos. A lot of them are indeed junk shots but those are easily deleted. The camera gives options to select which photos you want to delete.The only problem I've had with the camera is that it suddenly wouldn't download from the camera any more. I double and triple checked that everything was set up correctly. Fortunately we have a newer printer that I can load the SD card into and it sends the photos to the computer for me. I can also print right from the printer and bypass the computer entirely.There are a lot of features the camera offers that I've not played with yet but the one I used a lot yesterday was the kids and pets mode. This mode is great for anything that moves. This is one of the modes that offers the continuous option which I used yesterday for photographing the wildlife and the paraglider student.I'm a wanna be photographer with no formal training but have been blessed on many occasions such as yesterday to get some great shots even though I don't know as much as want to about shutter speeds, f/stops, and such.", "Date": "July 7, 2008"}, {"Title": "Love it", "Author": "Amazon Shopper", "ReviewID": "R35N7NU1WP8RUP", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Have had it for about a month.

Unfortunately I am beyond the return date for the camera so I'm stuck with my choice for quite some time. This is my very first Canon camera (prior digi cams were a Kodak and Sony), and I based my purchase on all of the positive Amazon reviews and the generally positive reviews I found on the Internet for Canon cameras. I even tested the camera for several weeks, but ... I have discovered it's not so great. The small size is wonderful and it can definitely fit in your pocket, purse, etc. very easily. The positives are in all the reviews. The negatives are not. Such as ... red-eye is in every single picture of people and pets; it is a real problem despite the red-eye reduction feature. Second, and the most important, the camera just doesn't take photos that are saturated with color - supposedly this is a good thing as the colors are accurately represented but, to my eye, the pictures are very dull, and the eventual prints are darker than I'd like. I like saturated, rich colors (even if they are a bit unnatural) and this camera is too `natural' for me. I've tried to adjust the settings - of which there are quite a few - but the dull color is something that is bothering me. Third, there is a side latch on the camera - where the USB cord is inserted that is flimsy and difficult to open each time; I ended up having to cut off the cover to the USB cord for easier access. Fourth, the low battery indicator comes on right before the battery is going out, so you're not given much notice about battery life. I read the manuals and I'm trying to like it, but the picture quality just isn't for me.", "Date": "February 24, 2008"}, {"Title": "Good value", "Author": "Tin Pigeon", "ReviewID": "R3ZFGZRTV2AGY", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Point-n-shoot cameras are not to be confused with SLRs and ought not be directly compared to them.  I've had several Canon's of both types.  This particular model is nifty.  Great quality shots, very small form factor.  Only drawback for me was the circular navigation button.  Each part of the button was flush with the back of the camera, and devoid of any tactile sensitivity.  It was difficult for me to use the button without actually looking at it.  Not a big deal for most, probably.If you're willing to do a basic study of photography and learn about exposure, lighting, aperture, ISO, and f-stop, you'll get great use of this camera.  While the feature set is admittedly slimmer than an SLR (see previous comment on such comparisons,) there are definitely enough settings you can manipulate easily and produce some great looking photographs.One thing that I've noticed is that this teeny tiny lens can somehow find a good middle ground when attempting to balance a high-contrast subject, such dimly lit tree against a brightly lit sky.  Such composition seems a trade off in most cases with the SLR (at least I haven't gotten the hang of it yet,) but the point-n-shoot seems to capture the best of both worlds on such shots.Definitely best used in daylight, or at slow speeds with a steady hand or tripod.  I'm not particularly fond of the quality of images produced using the flash, unless it's the slow-sync setting.The video clip setting is another nice feature.  They're AVI (read:  memory hog,) but great quality and fun to capture short 1 minute episodes.

I read the reviews about this camera and I thought I will get another great Canon product. But after using it for several months now, I have to say, I am very, very disappointed with this camera. This camera is a great example that smaller is not necessarily better. Yes, this camera is small and handy, it is sturdy (I dropped it onto concrete floor, not a scratch) and it has great features. HOWEVER, the quality of the pictures is bad. The flash (because of the small size of the camera) is not strong enough, so your pictures are very dark. The pictures come out only have focused, especially the outer edges of the photos are always out of focus. The overall quality is just not what I expected. I had the Powershot 500 (Ixus 500) and it was a great camera with fantastic pictures. I will go out now and buy a new camera because this one is just not worth the money. I will shoot for the G9 or something like it. Is bigger but much better quality pictures.My advise, don't go by the Megapixel, more is not always better.

This well crafted Canon certainly looks like it will last, but I've sold it at a loss after a month's evaluation - cannot bring myself to return such a quality product, yet, it's just not for me.Here is the gist: pictures look fuzzy upon close inspection. This is especially evident in scenes with foliage. I cannot get the clean texture nor the 3-dimensional look as from my Canon Powershot S2IS. Initially I thought the problem was with over-aggressive JPEG compression, a lens sharpness issue, or even slight camera shake, but after comparing file sizes and various settings I think that it is mostly an imager noise issue. Even at ISO 80, the minimum ISO possible, under the brightest of scenes, objects lose their \"true look\" and don't look like \"objects\" anymore. Perhaps Canon used a poor sensor, perhaps this is the limit of CCD imagers.The controls are also very \"one-dimensional.\" Again, coming from my S2IS, which has controls on every surface operable with both hands, it's much faster to get the shot you want. In the SD1000, all controls except zoom are on the back, and its various features (hackable using CDHK - Google for the wiki) require quick fingers since they're buried in the menus. It's like talking with someone without using any contractions.I bought this as a companion to my S2IS, having tried another Panasonic Lumix. The Lumix FX10 is especially heavy handed with JPEG compression, and its notoriously noisy sensor likewise ruined its otherwise excellent feature set for me.This is a personal opinion  piece by someone spoiled by a bulky, big-lens Powershot S2IS, so you might still find great things to like about this tiny jewel - its minute charger, precision color display, metal body, quick response (impress friends with continous flash photography @ over 1 fps), all screaming top of the line Canon design and Made in Japan precision.

For example, what is the life on the battery once it is charged?  How many pictures,etc. can be taken on one battery charge?  Is it necessary to have a battery backup?  Additional batteries are expensive.  This cost is out of line with product.  Otherwise, the camera is exactly what I wanted for my personal use.", "Date": "July 18, 2007"}, {"Title": "canon- cannot trust but I gave them one more chance", "Author": "oljey \"oj\"", "ReviewID": "R1Z14LH4G6MB4A", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "I had a canon A75 for 3 years and all of a sudden one day, the monitor became violet and it stopped taking pictures. The screen has black and violet lines and there was no coming back. If you google this problem, you will see that it happened to many people. Even I was perfectly satisfied with my camera I had to say good bye to it just because sth was wrong with it. I never dropped my camera, I took perfect care of it, so it is sth that canon has to do. I bought my A75 for 230 dollars when they were first in the market.Now, I bought this Elph camera. Looks good, so small. Sometimes I think it will fall from my hands, I feel like I need to tie it around my hand.It takes pretty high quality pictures but the pictures are not great. Even it is high quality picture, it is a poor picture, cannot reflect the real image.This is my opinion, some people might think different. But, if you are looking for sth that you just wonna carry in your purse and take pcitures, buy this one.Otherwise this is not a professional product. 3x zoom is good, too.by the way, canon, are you kidding us? What is 32 mb memory for?:))))We have to buy the 2 gb card. I mean if you produce sth like this and selling it for 160 bucks and you already put the sd card in. why not make it, 1 gb or 2 gb?anyways.I really feel like, this camera will also go bad in couple of years but still it was a good deal and I bought it.", "Date": "March 17, 2008"}, {"Title": "Great", "Author": "Sam Raja", "ReviewID": "RKYFCBRCJUNBJ", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "I am really happy with the product.
