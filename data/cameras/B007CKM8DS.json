He can take pictures from Montana and email  them to me in North Carolina via WlFi. He doesn't have to wait to hook the camera up to the computer!  The 18x optical zoom comes in handy at my children's soccer games.  I can't say enough good things about this camera!", "Date": "March 21, 2013"}, {"Title": "First 2 models were lousy; 3rd is great", "Author": "Teetoncey", "ReviewID": "ROX0YO16XQXDF", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "One lesson: make sure you get a New-in-Box model.  The first 2 I got were from a local, uh, discount store, and were probably, well, not New-in-Box....  The one that works is great.  Easy to learn, easy to use, great pix, 18x zoom, all kinds of neat features.  Cute, small, fair battery life (you can buy back-up battery and charger for <$7).  Best camera I've ever had (so far).", "Date": "December 16, 2012"}, {"Title": "Great camera!", "Author": "Sara Begue", "ReviewID": "R4K7GOHZK69ND", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I am very pleased with the camera.

The camera case is too small and has vivatar on the front although I purchased a Samsung. I could live with the incorrect logo if the camera would fit in the case. the package containing the lens cleaner, camera stand, sd card case etc.. was full of moldy soggy items because the cleaner fluid had leaked.
