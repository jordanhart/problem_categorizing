It runs everything! Plus I have it running LED's to jaz up my personal control center! And i still have extras to play with! I don't recommend hooking up your motum to it though, I still dont know what went wrong... But I fried my motum when I hooked it up $$$! I wired it up correctly, but I dont know how 1.2mA extra would hurt it, but it did??? But my security cameras seem to love it! My night vision LED's seem to be brighter now! I see the red eye's looking at me at night time clearly now!", "Date": "November 9, 2012"}, {"Title": "protect your camera night vision", "Author": "divino ll tan", "ReviewID": "R2N5FIKDNP5M1S", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Very usefull for CCTV camera protect your camera night vision and fan automatically start .i will recommend this product t", "Date": "May 23, 2013"}, {"Title": "12v dc", "Author": "sc", "ReviewID": "RW1NOH6PN7UZK", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "great service.
