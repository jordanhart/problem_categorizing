{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Excellent camera - be sure to customize the menus", "Author": "Slept Thru It", "ReviewID": "R2EBWWYG1F3S7J", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "(Minor updates below added in June 2012). I bought the NEX-5N in mid-October 2011 just before a trip to Europe.  The bottom line: it takes superb photos without flash, especially in truly adverse lighting conditions (wine caves 1,000 years old, for example).  As others have written, the camera with the 18-55 zoom takes extremely high quality photos - there's no quality penalty to get the benefit of the small size and light weight vs. a top DSLR.  So I think it could be used happily by both people trading up and people trading down.  But the camera does have quirks, some serious.  Many other reviews cover the overall high points of the camera, so I'll focus on a few review elements I think need reinforcement.The NEX-5N has a full auto mode, but I hope most buyers will take the trouble to learn the camera's full capabilities, because the camera can produce some amazing photos once liberated from auto mode.  However I have to say that the learning curve is steep, not just because the camera has a lot of capability, but also because the user interface is a real pain in the neck until you adapt to it.  The lack of dedicated controls, a consequence of the small size, creates a lot of complexity in daily use.Here's a specific example to illustrate some of the potential frustrations.  The camera can take an auto-HDR (high dynamic range) photo.  It will instantly merge three shots that it auto-brackets (in steps you specify) to yield a picture that would take several minutes to produce if you had to merge three shots yourself using editing software. Great ability, but here are the steps if you haven't customized the menus: 1. turn off raw if you were using it, which requires at least 3 menu presses. 2. press menu again and select the \"brightness/color\" controls.  3. scroll to and select DRO/Auto HDR.  4.  scroll to and select HDR.  5. if desired, press \"option\" and then change the HDR exposure differential for bracketing (ranges from 1 EV to 6 EV). 6. Press OK twice.  In total, you have to go through 6-9 key presses to get the camera ready to take an HDR photo.  Then to go back to normal shooting, you have to go through all the steps over again.  Your subject has to be no livelier than a sloth to allow this to work out.You can avoid many of those steps by customizing the menu buttons.  This requires first understanding what the camera can do and how you will use it, which will realistically take a few days of experimentation.  Then you have to futz with programming the menus for a while until you have the customization set the way you want it.  Then you have to get used to the new customized menus.  In other words, there's a steep initial investment to get usable access to all the power the camera possesses.  Most DSLRs have serious learning curves as well, so to me this isn't a reason to avoid the NEX-5N.  But it is something to be prepared for.  I found that I was taking low-light photos that I couldn't have taken with any DSLR I'm familiar with, so I ended up being quite happy with the camera, but I did some cursing at it before I got to that point.The best features:1. Extraordinarily good native low-light capability, plus several modes that enhance that underlying natural capability of the camera and lens: examples include hand-held twilight mode, anti-blur mode, auto-HDR, and dynamic range optimization.  All four are different.  It really benefited my photos once I figured out how those modes differ and when to use them.  My shooting may not have been typical -- I was spending hours a day in ancient wine cellars, gothic cathedrals, and the like, but even for snapping a low-light shot in a restaurant with friends (no flash), the camera was great.2. The size and weight are unbeatable.  I bought a Kata Grip-10 DL camera bag, which on paper was supposed to be a skosh too small for the camera, but it worked out perfectly.  I could wear the Kata bag on my belt, zipped closed with camera inside, flash attached, a spare battery, spare SD card, and the \"raincoat\" that shipped with the Kata bag, all fairly inconspicuously.3.  The tilt screen makes a real difference.The features the jury is still out on:1.  The detachable flash was on my list as a problem until I actually used the camera.  The last two weeks I left the flash attached all the time and that worked fine, although I found I almost never used the flash.  When I did use it, it overexposed the main subject almost every time, so I dialed back the flash output slightly.  Once I get the optional viewfinder, I think I'll be able to put the flash aside and not miss it much.2.  Movies.  I am not a big movie shooter so this was not a critical item for me.  I hoped I would receive a camera after the \"clicking noise\" was fixed in manufacturing, but no, mine does click during video recording.  Sony is kidding themselves if they really think the clicking noise only occurs when people are moving the camera in an unnatural way.  It's almost constant.  But I will send it in and from all I've read it will be fixed quickly, and the newer units supposedly won't have the problem.  So I'm not agonizing about that.  UPDATE: I originally wrote that I couldn't get large movies shot in AVCHD mode to transfer to a computer using Windows 7, and when an SD card that contained a mix of AVCHD movies and stills got close to full, the stills wouldn't transfer either.  I didn't lose any pics or video but I worried.  Updating -- since my original post, this problem seems to have gone away.  It's possible that there was a hardware problem with my built-in card reader, which got swapped out during a computer repair and now transfers seem to work ok.  Since I didn't see others reporting the same problem, I assume the hangup was at my end.3.  The LCD screen on its default setting (\"auto\") is hard to see in bright sunlight, BUT there is a setting you can scrabble your way to with many clicks that will brighten it significantly.  This setting makes the LCD usable even in bright sunlight, but it also messes up the color rendition of the LCD, adding an orange hue and oversaturating the other colors.  It also seems to drain the battery at a vigorous clip.  So there are two approaches you can use: turn on the super-brightness setting just for the key times you need it and then remember to turn it off again, or buy the apparently wonderful EVF viewfinder (for more than three bills!) and use the LCD much less overall.  I haven't tried the viewfinder yet but I'd like to.  It eradicates a lot of the price advantage of the NEX-5N vs a DSLR, however.The features that are not so good:1.  Focus can be slow in low light. That's largely due to the lack of phase-detection focusing, which isn't easily addressed in this type of camera.  The focus-assist light eventually gets it right almost every time, but it might take a second or even two.2.  If you set the camera to Auto-ISO, you can't control the highest ISO the camera will use.  It will range up to ISO 3200.  It's great that the camera takes pretty clean shots at ISO 3200, but that's no excuse for omitting a way for the photographer to limit the top ISO to a much lower number if he or she needs lower noise.  Even many inexpensive cameras offer that option.3.  Menus are complex and cumbersome and require lots of clicks to change settings, as previously described.  In addition, by default the camera is set up to provide \"advice\" every time you click a menu key, overlaying your menu choice with a paragraph of information you didn't request.  This is helpful for about three minutes and is then a big pain until you figure out how to turn it off.4.  The shutter makes the same sound as a DSLR and can't be changed, so there's no shooting stealthily.  Since there's no mirror to make a slapping noise, I'm not sure why the shutter is as loud as it is.  I wish Sony would change this if possible.5.  The touch-sensitive screen is, in my opinion, a failed opportunity.  It's way too easy to touch something by mistake and change a setting inadvertently.  On a small pocket snapshot camera, touchscreens may be useful.  And in theory the touchscreen could be good on the NEX-5N too, I suppose, but I found it messed me up, so I turned off the touch capability.  You may be more dexterous than I am so this may not bother you.6.  The only thing I missed by deactivating the touchscreen was the \"touch to focus here\" capability.  That was good when I meant to use it,  but also terrible when I didn't mean to use it.  Linked to that issue: focus tracking.  Sony advertises that the NEX-5N will track a moving subject once you touch the spot on the LCD screen you want it to track.  But it doesn't work.  It just makes the focus jittery and unpredictable.  The focus will not reliably track anything.  Sony should have improved that before going live with it.  The concept is great.6.  The movie mode button is badly positioned within a hair's breadth of where your right thumb, or sometimes part of your right index finger, can rest on the camera.  I recorded at least ten unwanted movies a day just brushing the movie button without meaning to.  The biggest problem this created was that when I went to press the shutter to take a still photo, nothing happened.  Only then did I realize the camera had been recording my useless mutterings for the last three minutes.  So I lost a few still shots from having to stop the movie recording and get back to stills.7.  Minor points: the default settings for DRO and HDR are too weak to make a difference, so at first those look like failed offerings.  But they just need to be tweaked to a stronger setting and they work fine.8.  Update: My son owns a Canon T3i so we've compared pictures taken with the two cameras, although not in any truly rigorous way.  The Sony NEX-5N build quality is higher than the T3i (less plastic), the rotating barrel feels more solid, and mostly importantly, the resolution of the Sony seems better.  If you read online lens reviews, the Sony 18-55 kit lens seems higher quality than the kits lenses that come with even DSLRs costing a lot more.Summary:  While the list of negatives I've enumerated seems long, on balance I think the strengths of the NEX-5N substantially outweigh the weaknesses.  In the world of ILC cameras, the NEX-5N seems to be in a league of its own when it comes to pure image quality.  To a serious photo enthusiast or professional, image quality is where everything starts and ends.  The NEX-5N takes exceptionally high quality photos, especially in low light.  The NEX-7 has additional strengths including even higher image quality in good light, but apparently doesn't quite match the NEX-5N's low noise in low light according to other reviews, and it costs a lot more.  I'm happy with the NEX-5N.", "Date": "November 9, 2011"}, {"Title": "High quality of photos, light, excellent low light performance", "Author": "Ali Julia", "ReviewID": "R3FN42SUEPJ1PA", "Overall":

I was looking for a camera which would produce results similar to my DSLR and allow me to change lenses yet be lighter than my current Canon DSLR camera.I like:(1) The camera is really light compared to my DSLR. Several times I panicked \"where is my camera\" while it was hanging around my neck. It was so light that I did not feel its weight.The body of the camera is 4 1/8 inches wide x 1 inch wide in the narrow part. It is small but not so small that is inconvenient to hold or operate. Overall the camera feels good in your hand, the mechanical parts (hinges and other controls) feel well made and pretty sturdy.(2) I am pleased with the quality of the photos I took.(3) Features that I loved, two features I never had in other cameras I owned:* Sweeping panorama - I absolutely loved it! It worked fantastically even hand held taking photos of night time skyline. (I am attaching a photo showing this feature)* Anti blur - in addition to having Optical Steady Shot this camera has an option for hand-held night shots. It takes 6 photos in quick succession and combines them to generate one shot reducing blur due to unsteady hands.Note: these settings produce JPEG format even when the setting is set to RAW(4) NEX-5N comes with a separate battery recharger, which is handy since the camera drains the battery rather fast it is nice to have a spare battery charging while the camera is being used. I purchased a 3-d party (Wasabi) battery pack (two NP-FW50 batteries, one Wasabi AC charger, one car charger converter for Wasabi AC charger, European converter) which works well with my NEX-5N. The entire pack costs less than one extra SONY battery: Wasabi Power Battery and Charger Kit for Sony NP-FW50, Alpha SLT-A33, SLT-A35, SLT-A55V, NEX-3, NEX-5, NEX-5N, NEX-7, NEX-C3(5) NEX-5N has a touch screen interface, I found it most useful to select the area where I wanted the camera to focus. The auto focus often selected the point of interest in the middle of the frame, when I was trying to compose a photo using 1/3 rule.(6) I was able to use the tripod quick release I use for my SLR without any special adapters. The quick release plate is a wider than NEX-5N body. It extends both in the front and the back of the camera. You cannot balance the camera on it (it tips forward), however once it is on the tripod it is very secure. I am attaching a photo which demonstrates the fit of the quick release.(7) SONY will have an OLED high resolution view finder for NEX series shortly. This will improve the ability to see the LCD screen when using the camera in the sun. Note: the mount on the OLED electronic viewfinder is only compatible with NEX-5N and is not compatible with NEX-C3.Update: I now own the OLED view finder. Love it. For more details you can see my review of it: http://www.amazon.com/review/RXNWAESUUHR49/ref=cm_srch_res_rtr_alt_8I don't like:(1) Edited 10/23/2011:  When I originally purchased the camera Photoshop CS5 did not recognize the RAW format produced by NEX-5N. However today I downloaded the latest CS5 update and now it recognized ARW files generated by NEX-5N.(Many thanks to clskip who alerted me to the availability of this update!)(2) The camera drains the battery, I plan to buy at least one possibly two spare batteries. On the day when I shot a lot of sweeping panoramas and anti motion blur photos (these options require multiple shots to generate one photo) I drained the battery completely. Need to buy several extra batteries (see #4 above for cost effective recommendation).(3) Default settings could be better. I changed almost every setting.The changes I found most helpful:* Changed LCD display to Big Font Size Display (located under top menu called \"Camera\")Why: this mode removes unessential icons surrounding the screen.Large font is easy to read, the controls became much more clear* Turned off pop up help (located under \"Setup\" and called \"Help Guide Display\")Why: The pop-up help gets in the way of every operation, you cannot see the screen as it totally obscureswhat you are looking at, when you get rid of pop-up then the screen you were looking at also goes away.* Turned off object tracking (located under \"Camera\" top menu)Why: When you are trying to compose a photo where the focus is NOT in the center, you can use the touch screento indicate where the focus should be. However, if the object tracking is turned on the focus begins movingand shifting even though the thing you are trying to focus on is not moving. The camera prefersitems in the center of the photo, rather then a composition using 1/3 rule.* Turned off face registration and smile shutter (located under \"Set Up\")Why: these options got in the way of a good photo composition(4) Movie record button is in awkward position. I hit it by mistake numerous times. I only realize I did it again because camera stops responding to my other commands.Overall, I am pleased with the camera and it satisfied my requirement for a light camera that produces results similar to a DSLR. Note that I am mostly interested in still photos, and have not used the movie option so far.Ali Julia review", "Date": "October 20, 2011"}, {"Title": "Great Camera, Check Video for Quality (Shot all

I love the camera, I just wish there were a few extra options such as a1. Headphone jack to preview audio (don't think thats asking too much)2. A better option for stereo and omni directional audio (either bySony or a universal accessory shoe would help)3. A slightly better flash or a built in flash like other cameras.All in all, I use this for video primarily and I love it.", "Date": "November 29, 2011"}, {"Title": "Good as a high-quality Point-and-Shoot, not suitable for the advanced photographer", "Author": "Nav J", "ReviewID": "R10KD9NE99WWS7", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "I'm reviewing this as a high-end prosumer camera, a grab-and-go camera to complement or even replace my SLR in most situations, which is what most cameras in this range are targeted at. I recently had the opportunity to compare the NEX-5N side by side with a Nikon P7100. I had very high hopes for this camera, especially given the great reviews and its large sensor. Yet, the quick summary is overall, the Nikon wins.  Why?I won't mention all the details that the other reviewers have covered very well. Rather, again, I'll focus on its use as an camera for an advanced amateur - someone who knows the kind of shot they want to take, and wants to take it quickly, without needing to use an SLR.Pro NEX-5N- SLR-size sensor means great image quality, even at high ISO. However, in practice it isn't much better than the G12 or Nikon P7100 as it ought to be given that it has ~3x the surface area. (I tested this with RAW settings on all cameras).- I like the zoom on the lens. Feels natural to a SLR user. I wish more cameras offered this!- Some nice features buried in the menus :)- Large, bright lens, even if it's slow.Neutral- The focusing ring on the lens is a great idea - but poorly implemented. Manual focus is actually not very useful on this camera. It takes quite a while (lots of rotation) and if you're in a hurry, you're likely to miss the shot. Then again, you're not likely to be focusing manually if you're trying to get a quick shot.Con NEX-5N- Not pocketable with the 18-55 lens.- The UI is terrible. It takes forever to change settings if you're doing anything other than pointing and shooting. It's really hard to do simple things like change the metering mode. And everything is in 1 of 3 menus, which means LOTS of scrolling to find the setting you need to change. You can't even directly switch between P, A, S, M - first hit Menu, then hit Mode, then Move the dial until you find the mode you want, then hit OK. Gets very frustrating after a while. I cannot overstate this - if you expect to change settings while using the camera, you will find the UI *incredibly* annoying. If you know your way around an SLR, a Canon G12, Lumix LX-3/5 or Nikon P7100, you will likely get better shots from them because you can actually set the shot up quickly rather than lose the shot while messing with the UI. However, if you just point and click and don't deal with the UI much, this won't bother you. Customizing the buttons and menus does help, but it's still annoying that so few parameters are directly accessible.- Subject tracking is terrible and just doesn't work - focus randomly jumps around the screen if you try to turn on focus tracking. Very annoying, since this could have been a killer feature.- The kit lens has a minimum aperture of f/3.5 - so this loses a lot of the benefit of the larger sensor, since you cant shoot with it wide open (f/2 or f/2.8) - so while I'm shooting with f/2.8 on the P7100, I have to stop it down one notch on the 5N. The resulting low-light IQ is very very close to a good quality smaller sensor like the P7100 or Canon G12. So, while it's nice having the larger sensor especially if you're not planning on shooting wide open, don't expect it to significantly improve low-light performance.- Auto White balance seems to end up with a yellowish tinge in almost all cases.- Tends to underexpose by 1/3 EV or so.Given the comparison, I decided to keep the P7100 and ~$200 :). This is not a prosumer camera - it's a point-and-shoot with better image quality at the expense of a more unweildy form factor - at near-SLR prices. If you want a point-and-shoot camera with near-SLR quality but don't want to mess with the controls, I could see this being a great choice. If you're an advanced photographer, you're likely to find it frustrating and prefer the G12, P7100 or LX-5.", "Date": "December 4, 2011"}, {"Title": "Amazing camera for low light situations", "Author": "ronparr", "ReviewID": "R3QZUKMKD24KGH", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I've been delaying upgrading my digital SLR while I waited for the mirrorless interchangeable lens camera market to develop.  I'm glad I waited.  The 5n has image quality as good or better than the best APS-C digital SLRs on the market and has additional features without the bulk of an SLR.I'm absolutely delighted by the performance of this camera in low light situations.  This camera has crossed an important threshold in low light performance:  ISO 3200, and even 6400 or 12800, are quite usable and not the noisy (or smeary) mess that previous cameras produced at this level of gain.  What this means in practical terms is that you can use the kit lens to take pictures at reasonable shutter speeds in indoor lighting conditions.  This changes the way you think about photography and changes they way people react to the camera.  You can now take candid shots at parties or family gatherings without the shock of the flash going off and the resulting change in subject behavior and harsh lighting effects from the flash.A few notable things and tips:1.  The kit lens isn't bad.  The first generation NEX cameras came with the same lens, but didn't produce as good results.  It appears that two things have changed since the first generation.  1)  Sony has tightened the QC on their lenses and 2) new NEX cameras add lens chromatic aberration and lens distortion correction (be sure to turn it on in the settings), which can improve results with this lens significantly.  The results are still a little softer than what one would get with a good fixed focal length lens, but are in line with what is typical for a zoom lens of this type.2.  If you're shooting in available light, you may get shutter speeds around 1/60, which is sufficient to avoid camera shake in most cases.  However, it may not be sufficient to freeze subject motion.  This may be surprising to you if you are used to shooting at 1/60 with a flash, but keep in mind that it is the flash that is stopping subject motion, not necessarily the 1/60 shutter speed.  If you want to shoot moving subjects indoors (e.g. people playing Wii or Kinect at a party) without flash, you should switch out of iAuto and use a mode such as P which lets you manually boost the ISO above 3,200 to something like 6,400 or 12,800.  This will give you faster shutter speeds.3.  Take the time to learn about some of the special modes that this camera has.  Handheld twilight and Auto-HDR (to name just two) are pretty amazing features that can be quite useful in certain situations.4.  It may seem strange at first that Sony has included a very small external flash.  (If the flash is so small, why not just permanently attach it to the body?)  The flash is very compact and attaches securely the camera, so it is the kind of thing that you can just leave on permanently.  On the other hand, the high ISO performance of this camera is so good that you might wind up using the flash rarely, if at all.5.  If you have a 3D TV, I suggest trying a 3D panorama.  It's really impressive.  You can view your 3D panorama by connecting a mini HDMI cable from the camera to your 3D TV.  If you have a playstation 3, I suggest the free download \"PlayMemories\" from the playstation store.  This will let you pan and zoom in 3D panoramas using the sticks on your controller.There are a few quibbles:1.  There aren't many buttons on the camera, which forces you to go through menus to change things.  This can slow you down if you're a more advanced shooter who likes to adjust settings.  Even if you customize the buttons, which helps, it can still be a hassle to do some simple things such as switching to manual focus.  The UI is probably the biggest negative for this camera.2.  The shutter is surprisingly loud for a mirrorless camera.  (Yes, it's a mechanical shutter and not a fake shutter sound.)3.  Auto white balance tends to be excessively warm in incandescent light.  I suggest you avoid iAuto mode in these situations and use another mode, such as P, which lets you set the white balance to incandescent.4.  It would be nice to have more control over how some of the automatic functions work.  For example, some cameras will let you specify a maximum ISO for auto ISO.", "Date": "December 27, 2011"}, {"Title": "Similar Looking, but Huge Change", "Author": "Jiunjr Feng \"Robert\"", "ReviewID": "RHJDUGBBELJED", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This is my first SONY camera and the 2nd mirrorless camera to replace DMC-GF2.NEX5N is the final choice after compared with pervious NEX5, incoming NEX7, DMC-GF3, and PEN3 mirrorless cameras because of below reasons.ADVANTAGES (GOOD):1. Faster focus and 0.02 sec release time log (Yes, NEX5 is not so good for fast action shooting, but NEX5N improved.)2. APS-C is better than M4/3 for low light performance.  It has less high ISO noise comparing with DMC-GF2. (After own DMC-GF2 for few months, I would like to say goodbye to M4/3 and move back to APS-C)3. Touch Screen for focus. (I bought DMC-GF2 and skipped NEX5 due to it, but NEX5N improved it now) Notes: currently, it doesn't work as well as DMC-GF2 for this function, but SONY should be able to improve it per future firmware update.4. 10 Pictures / SEC (You know how amazing it is)5. 210g (when no lens) That's what mirrorless for.6. 430 pictures per one charge.  Improved a lot from NEX5, so it looks like whole PCB redesigned with better schemetics and layout.)7. ISO up to 25600 (Even better than NEX7, but it's barely to set ISO more than 3200, so doesn't care of it)8. AF auto adjustment, E mount shouldn't need using it, buto it's good for mounting with other lens than SONY E lens. :)9. Build in filter funtions. It's fun.10. 60P with 24 support. It's p, not i!11. EV +- 3 (Improved from NEX5 +-2)12. APS-C = 1.5x (FF), and NEX5N keeps both photo shooting and video recording to be the same as 1.5x (NEX5 auto changes from 1.5x to 1.8x when movie mode)13. 49 Segment metering from CMOS image sensor (Same as NEX7)14. 10 x Digital room (Don't like the digital room, so don't care)15. Video recording enchanced functions such as removing environment noise such as wind noise, RE-focus, and adjustable aperture, ISO, and EV during video recording movie. (I was hoping to take picture when video recording, but NO. it doesn't provide this function.)DISADVANTAGES (BAD):1. EVF...... It's way expensive2. LENs...... Where are they? Even less than M4/3 lens3. Video \"Clicking\" Noise...... Sent back to SONY for the improvementCONCLUSION:Over all, it's the best mirrorless camera from the price point of view to compare all functions with other pocket size mirrorless cameras.  It looks the same as NEX5, but everything changed.  It comes with new image sensor and processor for huge improvements.  If you aren't a big fan for view finder, not plan to print super size picture, and don't want to spend 2x money on the similar camrea (NEX7).  Give NEX5N a try, and you will enjoy it as me.Update 2011/10/10 --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------It's not easy to deal with SONY calling center, which must localled outside USA. Finally, they arranged the video issue improvement with wrong delivery and status tracking mistake.  The good news is \"It works\", and I didn't hear any noise when I walk around to record video with naturally shaking the camera.  However, it still have the \"Clicking\" noise when you make crazy shaking, but it reduce the chance like 80% even it shaked crazy.  Any way, who is gonna recording vidoe per under crazy shaking mode.Another worse thing is, LCD had some sticky glue on top of it after NEX5 came back from SONY.  So, I am highly recommanded to have body cap to protect the cemera sensor, and put on screen protector for the LCD before send back to SONY. (I did that, so only need to change a new screen protector)Per awesome photo shooting and video recording without pervious \"clicking\" noise.  5 Stars for sure!", "Date": "September 10, 2011"}, {"Title": "Awesome low light performance and great HD video quality in a small package", "Author": "amxman", "ReviewID": "R3OJIB07EAYPIQ", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "First of all, this is a great camera for the price. Especially for those considering an upgrade to EVIL or 4/3 type. The Nex 5N technically belongs to neither category \"out of the box\". It is marketed as an APS-C format mirror-less interchangeable lens camera.Here is why1. The electronic viewfinder FDAEV1S is a $350 accessory from Sony. This accessory has received rave reviews but the total price creep (in addition to a few prime lenses which you might go for ) makes the Sony NEX 7N a much more attractive proposition.2. The Nex 5N boasts a full sized 23.6 x 15.8mm APS-C sensor which is approx more than 10%  bigger than the Canon APS-C sensor and significantly (65%) bigger than the four thirds format sensor. Every sq mm of that sensor is going to give you incredible low light performance. When it comes to sensors, size matters! Apparently this is the same sensor as Nikon D7000! The combination of 23.6 x 15.8mm with a 16 million pixel count beats even the Nex 7N on low light performance (maybe due to higher pixel count on the Nex 7N for same sensor size ) and even some DSLRs. Check out the detailed review on dpreview dot com and sensor performance metrics on dxomark dot com.Kit Lens SEL-1855 18-55mmIMHO, go for the kit. The lens is easily worth the extra $100 on the kit. Sony SEL-1855 F3.5-5.6 18-55mm zoom lens has decent performance for still and is super quiet for video. During video capture, the lens auto focuses quite fast even in low light. Due to the crop factor, the actual zoom is approx 27mm to ~70 mm. I did not observe and clicking sounds in my videos. Some have reported that problem.Interchangeable lens choicesThe camera performance is so good, it just warrants some prime lenses to complement the excellent sensor. To a serious IQ seeker, that will make perfect sense.The lens on most prosumer cameras (offering PASM modes) open up to at least f2.7. I am sure that many purchasing a $700 camera would want faster lens in their arsenal, at least f2.8. There is a limited but adequate choice of good prime lenses.1. Sigma 30mm f2.8 ex DN for E mount @ $199 - Approx 45 mm closer to the popular 50mm focal length.2. Sony SEL50F18 50mm f/1.8 @ $299 - Approx 75 mm. Its sharp, has excellent IQ and its fast. Great for portraits. Lens has built in image stabilization. This is a really good lens, I am glad I got it.3. Sigma 19mm f2.8 ex DN for E mount @ $199 as a wide 27mm lens. Its hard to say if its significantly sharper than the kit lens at 18 mm, some reviews say its sharper at the corners. All i know and care is that it is faster (f2.8) and smaller!There are others as well, the Sony SEL16F28 pancake (cost / performance issues), Sony SEL24F18Z 24mm f/1.8 Wide-Angle Prime Lens. Its a Carl Zeiss but its $1100.The LA-EA2 adapter for alpha mount lenses enables DSLR style phase detect auto focus. Phase detect auto focus is fast. Its really fast. But it restricts the alpha mount lenses to f3.5 in the AF mode. That's a bummer.Must have accessories1. As per many reviews that I read, if you must buy a prime, buy the Sigma 30mm f2.8 ex DN. It makes the camera pocket-able and is a great walk around lens.  I ordered mine, am yet to receive and test it.2. If you go for a second prime, try the SEL50F18. Its perfect for portraits and some outdoor shots. It has built in OSS.2. Get a tripod. Any tripod. More than the lenses itself, a tripod will make a significant impact on the IQ, especially for landscape and low light shots.3. Get a B+W polarizer for outdoor shots.4. Buy an Additional battery.Sony does provide an attachable flash. If you learn how to use this camera well, you might never need to use a flash. Ever. Or if you do use a flash, use just as a close range fill flash, not really to light up the subject.The prosGreat out of the box jpeg results in the iA mode. Big sensor, awesome low light performance, articulated LCD screen, touch screen display, touch to focus, light weight. Excellent built in HDR and DRO options. Customizable buttons and menu.One of the best options is to set the focus on DMF. Once the lens is focused at half shutter press, turn the lens ring to sharpen the object in focus, and the screen enlarges the object image to make it easier. This also works in flexible focus where the touch to focus feature is used to focus on an off center object. This feature also works with the Sigma prime lenses. There is also a peaking level which makes focus adjustment extremely easy. I have set the peaking light to white. It provides a quick and easy reference in most cases for focus adjustment.The Cons :1. No in-body image stabilization.2.The camera is light weight but the lenses are big. Presumably due to it's large sensor size. Its not easy to pocket even for a jacket. Unless you get the Sigma primes, be prepared to have it hanging around your neck.2.Those considering this as a back up might be put off by the absence of quick access dedicated buttons and a mode dial. The menu needs a bit of customization and getting used to. IMHO, the commonly accessed settings are an extra button or menu press away even after the customization. The more you know about photography, the more you find yourself wasting precious money shot moments getting thru an additional layer in the menu. No wonder they decided to redesign the 7N interface.3.The shutter is annoyingly loud. Bye bye quiet sneaky shots, the shutter is sure to attract attention. And no, its not a fake shutter sound that can be turned off.4.From the economics of the camera price / features / accessory cost, IMHO, this provides limited upgrade options. Additional investment in lenses will only pay off only if you go for the Sony \"next\" Nex. The additional accessories drives up the costs. The 7N might take a minor beating in the low light department but is an awesome upgrade. It focuses faster, has a built in EV, and has additional dial controls that can only by appreciated once you realize that you are 1 dial and 1 button short on the 5N. Most of all, the shutter click sounds quieter than on the 5N which is a loud click clack.TipsLearn to use the PASM modes well. Take que from the iA mode and then try the settings in the P mode. The right set of Aperture, shutter speed, exposure comp and WB  can lead to a gain of a stop and therefore permit a lower ISO setting. Try to stay at 800 or below. ISO 3200 is still useful but has visible noise. At ISO 1600, the noise depends on the conditions and other settings.For better low light focusing, turn off the auto focus assist light. You will be surprised with the results.Set the focus and metering to center, that somehow translates into a gain of one stop and permits a lower ISO setting for the same shot.Try HDR and DRO settings for better results. HDR requires multiple shots, DRO works it magic within a single shot. Maybe set DRO to level 3 and leave it there.Software :The AVCHD video can be viewed natively on Windows. No converter required!DXO optics Standard is on sale for $99 @ DXO site. This is the only one software worth getting for this camera. The DXO software has the 5N camera and kit lens profile. The default adjustments based on the camera and lens profile for lens distortion and denoising are quite impressive for Nex 5N. this applies even for jpeg files. I dont shoot RAW and I still saw impressive results. For e.g. try a brick wall or fence shot and run it thru the software or for people shots, notice the skin tone smoothing from the denoising process.If you are a PC user, just download the Windows Live Photo Gallery which provides basic adjustments and has a very useful auto adjust option. Its a free useful software from Microsoft.

Harley", "ReviewID": "R39HWBUNQGN991", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This camera is nothing short of breathtaking.  I compared shots taken with this to a Nikon D5100, Canon XSi, and Canon T2i (all with kit lenses, to be fair) and Canon G10.  This little Sony held its own as far as image quality.  Although on par with the DSLRs, it completely trounced the G10 (although I understand the G11 or G12 would be a better comparison, I can only compare what I have/had).  The biggest advantage for the DSLRs were the slightly faster kit lenses.  The 5N isn't the fastest camera in the world.  In fact, if you primarily shoot action shots or sports, I would advise steering way clear of this camera, at least until they offer faster lenses.  I would like to test faster lenses but the fastest lens available with this system without an adapter (the 50mm 1.8) is on back order.  I can't wait to give it a try.  I took the 5N to a track meet and tried to initially go full auto so I could enjoy the meet instead of worrying about camera settings.  Despite it being a bright sunny day, I still lost several action shots to motion blur, including the high hurdles and baton hand offs, I had to switch to manual to adjust the shutter speed to get acceptable results.  If you take action photos in full auto mode, you will get motion blur.  Action photos aside, using the 18-55mm kit lens, photos taken with the 5N have great clarity and sharpness.  Colors are nicely saturated and vibrant.  The best part is that you can crop them way down and they remain crystal clear.  There is little to no noise, even in low light situations where this camera especially excels.  This camera has taken totally clear shots in low light situations where other cameras have produced very noisy results unless the flash was used.  I would like to test faster lenses but the fastest lens available with this system without an adapter (the 50mm 1.8) is on back order.  I can't wait to give it a try.  An attachable flash is included but I'm not crazy about it.  Despite its small size it is quite overpowering and most of the photos taken with it are overexposed or look like you're shining a million candlepower spot light in the subjects face.  However, with enough distance or in really dim shooting conditions, the flash can produce nice pictures.  There is a more versatile optional flash you can buy for $150.Video is absolutely phenomenal on this thing.  No kidding, it completely blows away my three-year-old AVCHD hard drive video camera.  My wife and I both agree, the life-like video seems like broadcast quality.  stunningly sharp, beautiful colors and the tiny on board mic actually sounds pretty good.  It is not terrible like most built-in mics.  I'm not shooting documentaries or anything, so for my needs (family events, vacations, etc) it is more than sufficient.  This is truly the first camera that I feel 100% comfortable using for both video and photos regardless of the importance of the event.  At my daughter's graduation last year, I hauled a dedicated AVCHD camcorder along with a Canon DSLR because I wanted to ensure the best video quality possible.  This full 1080P video has eliminated the need to ever do that again.  On a side note, I have not encountered the dreaded clicking sound reported by many other users.  That was the first thing I checked immediately after unboxing.Although it has its merits, I'm not a huge fan of the touchscreen menu system.  Things can get a little confusing when you want a quick setting change.  However, it does allow programming shortcuts to the most often used features, so much like my original love/hate relationship with Microsoft Office's ribbon, it just takes a little getting used to but I'm sure it will be great once I master navigating it.  I still prefer more dials as opposed to all touchscreen.  The best part about the menu is it can help beginners achieve pro-like results (like adjusting depth of field for creative background blur) As for battery life, so far, I've had no problems getting a full day worth of shots on one charge. That's around a hundred or so photos and less than 30 minutes of video.  I don't really shoot more than that on a regular basis.  Battery life should satisfy most casual shooters (everyday people, not pro photographers).All in all, I'm very happy with this camera.  I wanted DSLR quality in a smaller size.  Although the lenses add considerable size to the diminutive body of the 5n, it is still much easier to carry around all day than a full-sized DSLR camera and comparable lenses.  In fact, a bag containing the 5N body, 50MM lens, 18-55 lens and zoom lens would be roughly half the size of a comparable DSLR rig.  Beautiful photos, small size, and excellent video.  The only negatives are the overpowering kit flash, moderate learning curve of touch-screen and high-price of factory lenses.", "Date": "April 22, 2012"}, {"Title": "Great compact alternative to SLRs!", "Author": "Charlie Hill", "ReviewID": "R3JAOXP1GJHT0F", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "This is a great solution for people who are unwilling to lug full DSLRs around but want superior image quality. I have never been willing to deal with the size and weight of DSLRs and until now settled for point-and-shoot photography (most recently with a Panasonic ZS7 12x travel zoom), which in my opinion still has its virtues. Now, however, using the smallest ($20) Sony kit bag, I have a very compact set-up that delivers vastly superior image quality to a compact P&S;, especially in low light. In the bag are the camera attached to the kit 18-55mm lens, plus the Sony 55-200mm and 16mm lenses, a couple of filters, and a spare battery. To support close-up macro photography (flowers, insects) I ordered the 49mm Hoya +10 close-up lens, not yet delivered. The camera with kit lens are together small enough to (barely) fit in a large jacket pocket for more discreet use.My shooting priorities are indoor shots of kids, family gatherings, pets, etc.; school plays, musical performances, etc.; nature shots (macro, landscape); kids' sports; and travel/tourism. The jury's out on the macro until my Hoya +10 arrives - the backup plan is to buy a legacy macro lens with adapter, which from all reports will work great at the expense of yet another lens to carry around. My Nex-5n combination does everything else on this list well except for kids' sports, where the 55-200 auto-focus is too slow to be useful (fallback solution is manual focusing).The Nex-5n shines brightest with most low-light /indoor photos and video. The image quality and shallow depth of field are a delight. I find in practice auto-focus works most of the time - e.g., in a room lit with a couple of floor lamps). When AF fails for lack of light/contrast, the manual focus with focus peaking is an excellent fallback, and really a joy to use.Like all decent cameras, it is generally very good for outdoor use in daylight, with some significant caveats...1. The zoom options are not ideal. I settled for the 55-200 lens, which requires the lens to be switched at 55mm focal length. For example, when shooting in a karate dojo, some of the nearer shots required the 18-55mm lens, and others the 55-200mm lens. The alternative from Sony is the very expensive 18-200mm superzoom, which is just as slow and its quality is somewhat debatable for the price.2. Auto-focus is not suitable for sports/fast action, as mentioned above, because of slow auto-focus. Manual focus with peaking offers a fallback but I haven't experimented enough with that to see how practical that is in practice with fast-moving subjects.3. Macro photography of small things (e.g., insects) needs either a close-up lens, or a legacy lens with adapter (and thus manual focus only). The Sony 30mm macro lens is too wide for smaller close-ups like insects, details of flowers.4. Video is excellent but the camera overheats after 20-30 minutes - it can't just be left running for a whole musical performance, for example. Results for a school music performance (dark auditorium, well-lit stage) are excellent. There is also the well-documented issue with the clicking sound. There is no 720p option, which I think is a miss. The 1080i AVCHD mode produces video that is seemingly wrongly encoded for the Mac tools that I use, resulting in horrible interlacing effects. The 1080p mode works fine, as does the MPEG4 mode.In operation, the camera is excellent - it's very usable despite the small body and (in some cases) large lenses. The kit 18-55 lens is the nicest to use in terms of ergonomics and integration with the camera. The 16mm pancake is borderline useful in my opinion. The touch screen is great for pointing to select the focus point, and general menu navigation. Customizing the menus helps bring key settings in reach. The panoramic shooting mode works quite well. HDR mode is somewhat useful. The hand-held twilight scene mode provides an interesting option for reducing noise in dark settings. The hinged LCD is very nice unless shooting vertically, in which case useless. The high-res LCD makes a great display with nice clear text overlays, although I have found myself wanting the electronic viewfinder in some bright sunlight conditions. Touch is generally quite helpful, but not perfect - doesn't recognize touch 100% of the time, and there are some minor annoying menu areas where touch is not supported. Start-up speed is fine. The JPEG output is good. I don't bother with RAW.A few nits, many of which Sony could fix with a firmware update:- There is no 4x3 picture format.- The photo metadata as seen in Aperture is not great - it really should provide more info on the specialized settings that the camera uses.- For some reason, lens distortion autocorrect is off by default - I turned it on. As discussed- The interesting Direct Manual Focus feature isn't practical per the DPReview review.- Auto ISO is limited to a max of 3200, and should be configurable to a higher ceiling value.- AWB gets incandescent light completely wrong.", "Date": "December 7, 2011"}, {"Title": "Good camera but lacks design perspective.", "Author": "S. Kanthi", "ReviewID": "RJ0IX89KT96H0", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I bought this camera + 18-55mm + 55-210mm lens in Sept 2011 before embarking on a month long vacation to India. This camera was able to produce to extremely good shots after i pushed the dial to Manual mode. I am an enthusiast photographer with a large equipment kit ! My bag carries a Nikon D90 & Canon SX20 IS. I was looking to replace the bulky D90 with the NEX-5N. But i ended up dumping the NEX-5N kit on eBay. Let me try to cover the reasons for that ..** CONS **[1] Neck Strap - The neck strap that comes with NEX-5N camera is a complete misfit to the entire design. Almost three or four times, the camera body slipped out of the strap connected to the hook and i caught it. May be it is a one-off incident but can't risk the value of entire camera.[2] Touch Screen - For the sake of product differentiation sony must have added this feature. The touch screen is completely useless and a big irritant when its turned ON. The object tracking feature is grossly inaccurate in focusing and gets activated when your fingers touch the screen. My advise turn OFF the touchscreen feature.[3] User Interface - While using Canon SX20 i got accustomed to using dials on the camera to adjust shutter speed, aperture and ISO. But with NEX-5N you can't do it! There is an option to set the right click button on the wheel for ISO adjustment, but it works only on Aperture or Shutter priority modes. Navigating the user interface every time to set ISO option is very painful and annoying. This can turn out to be a big discomfort when shooting in crowded places. I was trying to take a shot of Kanchipuram Temple(an iconic monument in Tamil Nadu)on an auspicious day. With so much people flocking the temple, I had a hard time standing rooted to the spot and getting a photo. Overall the user interface took me 3 steps backward from DSLR to Point & Shoot entry level cameras. Sony seems to have fixed the problem in NEX 7 with Tri-Navi control.[4] Flash - I am not sure why Sony decided to add an external mounted flash. It was no use to me, rather caused some discomfort while switching lens.[5] Auto HDR/DRO Optimization - This feature cannot be turned ON if you are shooting in RAW+JPEG mode. It's possible to be turned ON only in JPEG(fine/standard) mode. This is a simple SW feature, where Sony should allow the customer to use Auto-HDR mode and save images in JPEG only format discarding the RAW shots processing. Currently as a end user, i have to enable the Auto-HDR mode and navigate all the way to setup the photo options to JPEG only. Likewise there are so many other advertised options which don't work right out of the box. We have to tweak until we can shoot a picture.[6] Balance - The physical balance on the camera feels good when using the 18-55mm kit lens. But when i add the 55-210mm lens the weight profile drifts more towards the lens rather than the camera body. Mounting the NEX camera on tripod is a challenge and all the more a screwed up weight profile makes it even more difficult.Now ** PROS **[1] Extremely high quality images in Aperture & Shutter priority modes. The metering capacity is on par with any other DSLR in market.[2] Finally accepts SD cards and not sticking to the Sony Mem stick micro format.[3] Accepts a micro USB to USB cable to connect to PC/MAC. But the bundled SW is no good for RAW processing. Lightroom 3 is a good alternative and works perfectly with NEX-5N.[4] Sony customer service was good. I had two problems - Clicking noise and dust getting collected on the sensor. I sent the unit to them and got it back in a week or so. The overall experience was good.[5] Extremely good low light performance compared to Panasonic GF-2 & Olympus Pen.This camera is an ideal starting point for users who are concerned about cost and moving from point & shoot to DSLR arena. After getting a good grip on the camera usage you might explore additional lenses which is like any other DSLR system -> You are buying and investing into the NEX product line. Sony seems to have sorted out most of the issues in NEX 7, so you should probably compare the two before deciding on buying it.This camera also serves as a good standby smaller camera for Pro-DSLR users.

The image quality is INSANE, and the video is INCREDIBLE. The UI is great, the size, weight and build quality are top-notch.The orientation sensor is louder in this one than the NEX-5 (my roommate has that one). But I shake my other (Canon) cameras and they make noise too. There's a lot of operational noise in them too if I use the onboard mike. Try zooming! Am going on a trip, so I'll send it back to Sony for \"the adjustment\" after I get back. But this \"click\" meme has gone viral and people are totally blowing it out of proportion. You can get the external mike on Amazon for about $90 bucks if you want to totally obviate it. Chances are if you are making a handheld video of your newborn, your steps, wind noise, and breath in quiet scenes will be louder than any operational noise from the camera. If you're seriously expecting cinema quality sound out of the onboard mike on a $700 point-n-shoot, dream on. I haven't made a single video where the sensor noise bugs me.Go ahead, watch the videos on YouTube. It's not that loud. About like the sound of clothing rustling. These point-n-shoots have automatic gain, which means in quiet scenes they turn the volume up to to the microphone, in loud environments they turn it down. The only way you can make the click annoying is if you're videoing in silence and move the camera around a lot (which produces unwatchable video.) Wouldn't you just silence the soundtrack in your Video Editor in those scenes if you're making the sequel to Avatar? If there's talking going on, and sounds you want to capture the gain goes down and you don't notice operational noise.Jeez gadgets have become the new religion of the 21st Century, and there are apparently folks who think Sony is the devil.For contrast, consider Apple Fanboys who totally forgave the antenna bridging issue on iPhone 4. (And I have an iPhone 4, am left-handed, so I put it in a case.) Sony answered the complaint very fast. Don't let the ideologues let you miss out on a groundbreaking image capture device.Plus, Adobe just released Camera Raw 6.5 which reads the NEX-5N! The raw images are AMAZING!Additional: So now I've taken it on a once in a lifetime 3 week trip of the Greek Isles. I never hesitated to bring it with me, it's so light!! This was my main concern because I'm very lazy. I took tons of photos and many beautiful videos. After I got back, I sent it in to Sony for \"the adjustment\" and now it makes less noise than my roommate's 5. Seriously I think this is a great balance of weight/size vs image quality. The weight is all in the lens, which is fantastic. I brought the flash, but never needed it, if you can see well, so can it. Many fun pics of dinner on the boat with no flash artifacts. My cohorts on the trip had tiny point n' shoots, but I came back with postcard quality images and video.

James", "ReviewID": "R3EQC1ARFKA2QG", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "eUPDATE #2: ---12-28-11---Well I have had a little time with the camera since unwrapping it Christmas Eve and have a few thoughts. First to address some of the other reviewers saying it isn't that much better than a point and shoot with a sensor 1/3 the size. For taking snapshots on auto with flash maybe not so much. Any other scenario I have tried, yes much, much better. It is like any thing, to make an analogy, if you putt around in a Corvette you would say it isn't much better than a Impala, and rides worse to boot. The upside of this camera blows any point and shoot away. The IQ you can get is great just look on flicker. It has way more dynamic range, crazy low light as good as a Nikon d7000 (which is well over $1000)Nikon D7000 16.2MP DX-Format CMOS Digital SLR with 18-105mm f/3.5-5.6 AF-S DX VR ED Nikkor Lens and isn't any bigger than a superzoom!I know it isn't any bigger than a superzoom as I am coming from the Sony dsch9 a fine superzoom in its day.Sony Cybershot DSC-H9 8MP Digital Camera with 15x Optical Image Stabilization Zoom It has full manual control and takes fine photos in daylight or with a flash. However in low light-- no flash meant a noisy mess of a picture for the most part. If you are tired of the blowed out look in you photos like I was this Sony could be your answer.I have been amazed at the low light abilities of this camera. If you just leave it on auto as I did for awhile on Christmas Eve it will jack up the iso right off. I was leary of what the 3200 and even 6400 iso pics it was taking would look like. No worries, they looked better than the superzooms did at 1600 and even 800 iso. You can leave the flash off for most things, it is truly what I was hoping for in the low light quality.So, so far I have said it will blow away any point and shoot in low light stills. Lets move to video for a moment. First about the video button placement, I have average size hands, not big fingers but I can palm a basket ball (barely) and reach over two octaves on a piano if that helps your visualizing. I have had no problems with the video button as many others seem to. I keep my thumb right around that little grippy pad just over the controls ready to hit one of the custom keys most of the time. I find myself having to consciously reach up to hit the movie button. I have to look to hit the playback button in addition to reaching sometimes, although the movie button comes easy with out having to look. I think it has to do with how I grip the camera I hold the lens barrel with my left and have a lighter grip with my right, with my index finger wrapping around to the shutter. I have used the 16mm \"pancake\" and it is a little different that might be some of the trouble for other people if they shoot with it. I do think it was designed with gripping the lens in mind, not really one handed.Enough about the button, I was looking to replace a Sony hi8 video camera with this in addition to the superzoom, so video was a strong consideration for me. The video is stellar. This camera has features that much more expensive cameras don't, even dedicated video cameras (1080p 60 per second and full manual control). It starts with that big apsc sensor. Most video cameras have a smaller sized sensors similar to the point and shoots. This bigger sensor gives it a big advantage in low light it really takes clear vibrant footage. It is good enough that professionals were using it and putting it up against full frame cameras such as the Cannon 5D MKII ($2175 here on Amazon!)Canon EOS 5D Mark II 21.1MP Full Frame CMOS Digital SLR Camera (Body Only)That it holds its own against much more expensive gear is nuts, they (the pros) were griping about the audio and the tax mandated 29 min limit on length, but really how could you it is a still camera first. I hadn't used my video camera to take a recording longer than 29 min in years, so it was a sacrifice I was willing to make in the name of less stuff to cart around Disney or where ever else I might go. Some people have reported overheating issues after a few minutes of video, I have not had any problems but I have not taken a video longer than 7-8 minutes in one stretch yet. It doesn't seem to be stabilized as well as my video camera is, or even the superzoom for stills for that matter, the oss system is in the lenses and I don't think it is quite as good as in body stabilization.Now on to another point that a point and shoot cant touch. Depth of Field. This is when your subject is crisp and that beautiful rose bush behind them is blurry with just some great color coming through and wow the picture just jumps at you. This is something you can not get with a smaller sensor, it is just the physics of the light. It will carry over to the video also so you will get a much more cinematic feel. Coming from a superzoom I could get a little bit but not much. With this you can put on almost any lens ever made (with adapters) and get crazy dof if you want it. The more I use it the more I like it, it was an adjustment when you are so used to every thing being in razor sharp focus from the point and shoots.This brings me to another point. This camera is a totally different beast than a point and shoot and if that is all you have ever used you will have some adjustments to make as I have. Having that great dof control means that focusing will be much more critical. Point and shoots have a small sensor so the dof is huge, everything is almost in focus by default. This makes the newer point and shoots very quick to focus. This camera on the other hand has more work to do by the nature of it and in low light it can be slower than you might think. It is still faster than any point and shoot I have used. Some might start talking about Phase detection auto focus which is what the big dslr's use but I won't say too much as I am comparing it against point and shoots. This camera uses contrast detection autofocus which is what point and shoots use. It was a choice they made when they designed the camera, Phase Detection is faster but means a bigger camera for the guts of it. Now while the focusing may be somewhat slow by dslr standards the shutter lag is the best in the world bar none right now. You hit the button and bamm you have the picture, this is a small thing but it makes it much nicer to use in my experience, it helps you to get the shot more often. If you compare it to a dslr it has no \"mirror slap\" no mirror to slap! If you have used a superzoom as I have it is also an adjustment giving up that zoom! Mine would do 15x and I used it all the time. The kit lens with this Sony does about 3x. I have learned to adjust and you do get a much bigger view as it covers much more of a room than any point and shoot. I think it has been a fairly even trade and the wider view pays on every shot whereas the zoom was really only needed once and awhile.A couple other thoughts after using it for a bit. To harp on what others have said the menu's have regressed from the ones in the h9. I have been disappointed in the unnecessarily complicated menu's. The h9 had full manual, I don't know why they seemed to think it needed more sub menu's to control the same functions. I don't know why they think the anti motion blur should have its own spot on the mode dial but the very similar hand held twilight should be another menu down in the scene menu. It is obvious they have some different folks designing things now. Too bad, sometimes less is more even given all they put in it.Another thing that kind of gripes me is the 10 shots a second that they have gotten a lot of press for. I thought I had a bad card (Amazon class 10) at first. I bought one of the fastest around-- (SanDisk Extreme Pro 16  GB SDHC Flash Memory Card SDSDXP1-016G) and still wasn't getting more than 6-7.This is what I did and I got 10-11 for a sec before it slowed. You can't shoot raw, and fine jpg will get you only the 6-7. I shut off all in camera lens correction etc and set it to standard quality. This got the 10-11 a sec.It doesn't make much sense to me. You would think raw would be the fastest for the camera no compression or anything else to do. So you have to shoot jpg, and shut off the in camera corrections. That sucks, its hard to correct a jpg!Now to sum up my thoughts on this camera. I believe if you just want to whip out a camera and snap a few quick shots without much thought than maybe think twice about getting this camera. It will do that and quite well but I think the Nikon J1 or V1 would be better -- if you know that is all the work you will do and won't miss the upside this camera provides. When I got the h9 superzoom a few years ago I was in awe of all the tweaking you could do with full manual controls and boy did I. I ran up against what that camera could and couldn't do quickly and understood that and lived with it. I have a little girl now and wanted more IQ and less harsh flash. This camera I believe is the best bang for the buck in years IQ wise and you can get stunning photos in a package you will take with you, unlike the big dslr's. I wanted a dslr -a77 comes to mind- but the price is high and I knew that I wouldn't take it with me after the new wore off. To get those great photo's takes work and this camera with its crammed menu's will take as much work as running a big dslr, just in a sleeker package. You can putt around town and just take quick snaps on auto, and they will look great thanks to the much less use of the flash. Or you can put your foot in the gas and really see what this camera will do. I think if you want the upside as I do and are aware that it takes work, (any camera does to get the great pics) you will see that it is a world beyond a point and shoot!UPDATE: I received my Nex 5n back from Laredo TX. I have added a star based on the condition upon return. I took it out of the shipping box and it appears to be glue free thankfully. It is the same camera I sent in --- the serial number is the same, and I also marked the inside of the battery compartment. I took another short test video and the clicking seems to be completely gone:) Thanks to Sony Laredo and good work! Time to wrap it up and put it under the tree (very hard to resist playing with it more). Original review remains below.I have been trying to talk myself into springing for the NEX 7. The floods and consequent delays made me pull the trigger on the 5N. I called Sony and was told on the phone several times that the \"clicking\" had been fixed and that none of the cameras now shipping had the clicking problem.I guess they will say anything to sell. I received my 5n this week and was able to charge it up last night. I took a short test vid this morning and promptly boxed it up to send in. It clicks at the slightest movement. I mean you don't have to be doing any thing at all and it clicks. I didn't hear it when it was recording, but on playback it is very prevalent. It is even more so on the pc or tv. I am giving it 3 stars on its reputation alone as I didn't even snap a single picture. I will update this review if I receive a noise free camera back. I am concerned about having the factory sealed body cracked open and what long term effects that will have. I am not encouraged with other reviewers stating they had glue on the body when it is returned.I really want them to make it right as I believe this is the best bang for the buck by FAR.

First, the look and feel is pretty identical. I do like the placement of the playback button. I also really like the new touchscreen, it makes things so much more efficient versus NEX 5 and the dial. The dial is still there but you can do a lot with the touch of a finger now. One thing to note is that you can only use Sony batteries with this camera. I had a third party battery I used with the NEX-5 and when I tried to use it with the 5N I got a message telling me that I can only use genuine Sony batteries... bummer. Otherwise, the camera is faster than the previous model has a slightly higher pixels count. Amazing performance in low light.", "Date": "September 7, 2011"}, {"Title": "dpreview gives this a Gold rating", "Author": "Sean Lancaster", "ReviewID": "RNEY425QMOCDA", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "dpreview just gave this camera a Gold rating this week. Very few cameras earn this distinction. This camera should pretty easily be getting 5 stars consistently; however, this first batch of cameras had a clicking sound for people shooting handheld videos with some off-balance camera movements. That being said, Sony is offering a quick fix that seems to be doing the trick (I just sent mine in with free overnight shipping both ways). And the dpreview rating was given despite the video clicking sound that some people experienced. I wouldn't think twice about buying this camera again right now if I hadn't already bought one.I bought this camera because of the 16.1MP CMOS sensor, which is getting rave reviews across the board. This is a better sensor than many DSLRs on the market. I also really wanted the ISO range of 100-25600 (I have some images up to 3200 ISO that are still sharp with barely noticeable noise). I have had the camera almost a month now and I have only used the flash 1 time just to see how it worked. I don't anticipate using the flash much at all as I can get really good photos in low light. And, all of the settings I use can work in video mode as well. And, JPEG photos are spectacular. I planned on shooting raw, but the jpgs are great. I had a Nikon D70 and some nice lenses that I sold and the NEX-5N is helping me to not miss my bigger DSLR. And, this 5N is head and shoulders above any MFT camera.This camera is not pocketable, but I do have the 16mm lens and it can be pocketed in a jacket pretty easily, but not my jeans. Then again, I tried a Lumix LX5 prior to this Sony and I could not pocket it either and this also applies to micro four-thirds cameras (MFT). But this camera is very easy for me to carry around with a wrist strap and barely feel like I am holding it. It's easy to cup my fingers on the grip and be ready for any shot. I also like being able to tap on the touch screen to tell the camera where I want the focus. The touch screen can pop up and tilt up or down, which is nice when trying to be stealth or trying to shoot over a crowd. In any regard, I don't give a lot of perfect ratings but this camera is about as perfect as a camera can get at this price point (or even under $1000).EDIT: I recently purchased an adapter for Canon FD lenses. These are legacy lenses that are manual focus only. I love using manual focus on the NEX-5N. With focus peaking and the touch screen I can focus in low light sometimes more quickly than autofocus. I enjoy using manual focus and doing so opens up a world of affordable and high quality lenses.", "Date": "October 6, 2011"}, {"Title": "Best digital camera I have owned", "Author": "Quoad Toad", "ReviewID": "R3GLAJ6PMXK74F", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I am very impressed with the Sony NEX-5N.  The pictures are superb even out of the box and I think the extra weight over a smaller point and shoot is well worth it.  I'm just a casual consumer when it comes to cameras, definitely not a professional photographer.I've owned many small digital cameras, but always felt slightly disappointed with them.  I wanted to move up to a DSLR, but didn't want to carry around a heavy, bulky camera.  I was hesitant about the NEX-5N, since the lens makes it larger than my other cameras, but I wanted I wanted better pictures, so I gave it a try.I am very happy with the results.  It is heavy and somewhat top heavy (considering the lens), but it's much more manageable than a regular DSLR.The pictures are simply spectacular.  I dislike flash photography and even pictures taken in dark situations turn out nicely.  The camera often picks a higher ISO than I would like, but after I set up short cuts, I could more easily switch between ISOs.  (Note:  I wish I could give the camera a range of acceptable ISOs instead of just picking one ISO.)  Pictures taken at high ISOs are acceptable.  I prefer to use a low ISO though if I can get away with it.Overall, I am simply amazed at the detail of the pictures.  The camera seems to pick up everything without distortion.  I don't miss having lots of zoom (like in my point and shoot) since I can crop the NEX-5N pictures to the same effect as having lots of zoom in a point and shoot.The camera is also very quick when it comes to snapping shots.  I have a lot of fun taking picture after picture.  The camera takes almost no time processing each picture.The NEX-5N also comes loaded with a lot of fun features.  Just the other day, I discovered that it has a \"smile mode\" where the camera will take a picture when it sees someone smiling.  I'm not sure how practical settings such as \"smile\" mode are, but they are fun to use, especially since the mode actually works.  I'm still learning about all the settings and having a good time with it.I highly recommend the Sony NEX-5N.  It's not pocketable, but you don't need to carry it around in a huge sack either.

I'd been in the market for an enthusiast point-and-shoot, and was leaning towards the Canon S100. He pulled a NEX-5n out of his bag and completely changed my mind. He was using an adaptor with a Leica lens, and I immediately thought of my old Canon FD lenses, my Canon bellows, etc., and realized I could put all that glass back to work. With an inexpensiveFotodiox Lens Mount Adapter, Canon FD, New FD, FL Lens to Sony Alpha Nex E-mount Camera Adapter, fit Sony NEX 3, Nex 5, NEX-VG10, Fits Original FD lens and New FD lenses, I've got a great range of primes, plus the Sony kit zoom.I do a lot of close-up and macro photography for my business and my old digital camera was intolerably slow, with unattractive barrel distortion in the macro shots. The old Canon glass or a Schneider Componon enlarger lens on the bellows give me perfect macro shots.The 18-55 lens is sharp, but has the distortions you'd expect with an inexpensive zoom. They're easy to correct in Lightroom or AfterShot Pro, however. The lens is incredibly light, as is the body, but magnesium instead of plastic makes for a sturdy-feeling unit. It's a bit bulky for a grab-and-go, too big for a pocket, but the picture quality and system capabilities far outweigh that.Two things I like best about the NEX-5n's operation are the touch screen and the customizable buttons. I did not expect to like the touch screen, but it's an excellent feature. I could quibble with the location of some of the items, whether they're under \"Camera\" or \"Setup,\" but overall, it's easy to get to the features you want. Even better, you can assign almost any function you want to two of the buttons, and one of them lets you scroll through five additional choices. So you customize the camera to work the way you use it most.If you touch the screen in some modes, the camera will follow-focus on whatever you pointed at.I have not used the smile detector, face tracker, or the scene modes, but all those features are there for convenience shooting.The other excellent feature of the screen is that it flips up horizontally, for looking down, waist-level or tripod shooting; it also folds to a down-facing position, so you can look up at the screen when you're shooting over heads in a crowd.The quality of the photos from RAW or fine JPEG is stunning, the equal of many full-size DSLRs. With or without onboard noise reduction, you can use the higher ISO settings with excellent results. Night shots or high f-number shots are surprisingly good.I haven't shot much video yet, but what I've done so far is quite good.I would probably trade off a slightly larger body for anti-shake in the camera instead of the lens. It would make my old primes more useful. But I can save my pennies for some of the fine E-mount lenses being offered.So far I have not missed having a flash/accessory shoe.The viewfinder is an expensive accessory. It's probably necessary for sports or action photography, but I haven't found a need yet.I got the Sony HVLF20S Flash for Sony Nex Series, which fits into a small, hidden socket on top of the NEX body. It is kind of fiddly to attach, but is secure once mounted. The flash is absurdly powerful; In tele mode, it gives you adequate light 25-30 feet away. Along with the minimalist NEX body, the flash gives the camera that I'm-from-the-future look and feel.Overall, this is a great enthusiast camera with a handy zoom range and reasonable apertures.

There isn't much I can say about this camera that hasn't already been said in other reviews both here and on professional sites and blogs.  That said, if you are interested in stepping up from a point & shoot but don't want to make the personal investment of learning the ins and outs of a DSLR (and don't want to lug a huge camera around), you can hardly go wrong with this shooter.  It's easy to use and takes beautiful photos, even on the automatic setting.  Full manual control is available if you're up to the task, or are just that persnickety.  A big selling point of the Alpha Nex series is the interchangeable e-mount lenses, but if you have no interest in such things do know that the included 18-55mm lens is suitable for most shots.I only have 2 complaints with regards to this camera.  The first being that at higher ISO levels in low light there is a fair deal of noise.  That is pretty common for digital cameras, but still a little disappointing considering the price of this camera.  My second complaint is that my unit has a dead pixel smack dab in the middle of the rear LCD panel.  It took me a few days to notice it, but now that I have, I cannot unnotice it.  It is rather distracting.  Dead pixels in LCD panels are a fact of life, and 1 dead pixel on a screen is well within acceptable QA limits, and would not be considered a defect.  Neither of these issues are enough for me to dock a star.  This is, hands down, the best camera I've ever owned.  Highly recommended.UPDATE: I forgot to mention in my original review that my unit does NOT have the widely reported \"clicking\" issue when shooting video.

I take pictures for my own enjoyment and I do delve into artistic photography at amateur level. Therefore, if you are looking for deep techno babble, this review probably will not help you. But, if you want my hands on experience using this product, please read on.I've owned this for the past 8 months. I also own Sony alpha DSLR A300K, with a higher end Carl-Zeiss lens. I hike a lot, and my alpha was heavy, burdensome, but, took great pictures. So, this will be my comparison. The pros highlights-Form factor- weighs a fraction of the full DSLR. Very convenient for traveling.-16 mp. Plenty for posters of my landscapes and then some.-Photo quality- I've not found any faults so far. I've taken pictures of people, macros of flowers/insects, landscapes. It takes brilliant pictures. My custom Carl-Zeiss is sharper, but, I did not expect the same output from the stock lens on this camera. You can plunk down $700 and buy the higher end replacement zoom for this. I develop my photos using Lighroom 4, and with just a few tweaks, photos stand out. I don't really miss my DSLR. I'm even considering selling it.-Low light performance is way superior than my older camera. I've not even used the detachable flash. Noise outstandingly low.-there are some cool extra features, such as capturing only reds or yellows etc (you can do this easily post-production, but, nice to have on the camera), autoHDR, anti-motion blur.- I did have the clicking noise fixed by Sony. I love the Hd movies this camera can take. outstanding quality and very convenient for hiking/trekking. Just remember to pack extra SD cards. If you don't care about full HD, then take movies in mp4 format. Easy to transfer across platforms. AVCHD is a bit tricky to use, but, if full HD is what you are after, then worth the extra hassle.There are several very nicely detailed reviews of the camera, and I would totally agree with the positives. About the negatives, I agree that the Ui is complicated, but, can be customized. I've yet to accidentally take videos (the button being right next to shutter release, a problem described by many).Overall, may be a little on the expensive side, but, worth every dime for my needs.

I used the camera for about 4 weeks now and played around and tested it so many ways with all settings and combinations from the perspective of a simple camera user taking advantage of the SLR capabilities. Also please note that my review is based on the picture and video quality reviewed on a 1080P Projector.Pros:1. Very light when compared with regular SLR's2. Excellent pictures taken in auto mode and people across the globe figured that I bought a new camera when I uploaded to Picasa. You can imagine the difference if people can figure out without me telling them about the camera. I got great feedback on the pictures taken in a auto mode as a point and shoot camera.3. It has a decent battery life and lasted the whole 8 Hr trip with about 300 pics approx. and 30 minutes. video.4. Video and photos are excellent and the Video is at Blu-ray quality and is verrrrrry impressive. If you record in Blu-ray format it takes approx one gig for 30 minutes. It consumes approx 10% of the battery for 30 minutes of video5. Add on cute flash6. Speed is awesome, camera takes continuous snaps with no hesitation.7. Good features to get best picture qualityCons:1. BIGGEST PROBLEM: There is a overheating problem with the unit when you record video, I tested this thoroughly before writing it, I recorded 30 minutes with a thermos symbol in the middle of the screens but still completed 30 minutes recording, but the unit seemed to get hot enough so you can feel the heat to the stem of the lens body. After 30 minutes I recorded again and the camera shuts down under 10 minutes. I repeated these steps like 10 times to ensure I do the burning test before I return it. Also I did notice that when you move the lcd up from the body to give it a air vent it minimized the overheating issue but didn't solve the problem. There are several postings on the web about this issue but there is no solution with firmware or Sony addressing it. I haven't called the Sony service yet.2. Stock lens that comes with the camera (18 to 55) does not have good zoom, maybe 4x compared with pocket cameras, again this point is based on the point and shoot users perspective but you can get 18 to 220 lens if you really need zoom.3. Flash gets in the way when you adjust zoom mainly focus adjustment is ok.4. I wish the video is in MPEG or AVI format to get a DVD quality, which is better than MP4 format.5. Too many settings in different places and it takes really a good hands on practice sessions to get to know the camera.6. Doesn't come with a pouch or bag.7. Features or functions navigation via rotary or other buttons is not great. Sony should have created a custom mode where you can save all your settings.Bottom line, it is a great camera but may not be a camcorder replacement even thought it takes greeeeeat videos.

I bought this camera for a mountain-climbing trek several months ago.  I needed a high quality camera that would be as light and small as possible, as we were hiking for a week at about 16k feet, and I knew that every additional ounce would matter.  Also, I occasionally produce wall-size prints from my shots, so it was important that the camera have a large sensor and high image quality. For the image quality, size and price, I doubt you can beat this camera.  In fact, I would say the image quality is overkill for the sporadic family photographer.I've bought a number of the accessories and particularly prefer the 16mm lens with occasional fisheye converter.

It actually has documentation in the camera - a help button you can select and popups that explain every setting you select. You can use the touchscreen or the physical dial/buttons for just about anything, your choice. I find I generally prefer the physical controls which let me use the thumb of my right hand as I am gripping the camera, but the touch screen option comes in handy more often than I thought it would. Also the ability to touch a spot on the screen and have it focus on that is very nice. I had a Canon G12 10 MP Digital Camera with 5x Optical Image Stabilized Zoom and 2.8 Inch Vari-Angle LCD for a month before this one and I do not miss it (Canon's G series has tons of dedicated physical controls which are handy for learning photography via experimentation).Comparison to Canon G12:I was unsure of this purchase at first because comparison images from this camera and the Canon G12 on sites like dpreview.com didn't indicate a clear winner, despite the Sony's 8.5x larger sensor and bigger lens. However, within 5 minutes of turning on the Sony I was pretty well convinced. Having taken this thing to Bora Bora for a week I am absolutely certain it was the right choice, even in spite of the price difference. This camera is fast, it doesn't take much work to get great images out of it, and if you want to take control it has all the settings you'd expect and lots of impressive features to use. The HDR and panorama modes are insane, as are its video capabilities. Video recording has its own physical button, so you can start recording video instantly without changing modes/settings or even looking at the screen first.One potential negative to note is that Sony has gone the Sony way with this camera - proprietary and/or esoteric accessories. The attachment port for the flash is not a standard hot shoe. They call it \"Smart Accessory Terminal 2\". They'd have to change the shape of the camera to fit a standard one on here. Also the lenses are E-mount type. Again, I think this is b/c they are smaller than standard lenses, but it does limit selection.

I don't know how to take a blurry background shots with a point of shoot.  With this camera, it is at ease even with the 18-55mm kit lens.  Just by touching the screen, you can choose where you want to focus on.  For example, I have two kitties one standing closer to me and once further from me.  Just by touching on which ever one I want to focus on, the camera does it automatically.  I don't need to know how to change the settings or do anything special.  It is also as easy to see both kitties clearly if that's the shot you are looking for.  Just have to slide your fingers to focus/defocus.  In addition, the object tracking is just as easy.  Just aim at my kitty and click on a button, the camera then tracks his movement.  You can see the square focus following the kitty around.  I think it is very intuitive, and you really don't have to spend much time learning to use the camera.My other problem with my old camera is taking photo against bright sunlight.  With this camera, in auto mode, the face is not too dark, and the background is not too over exposed.  I can see both the background and the face.  It has a nice balance. I didn't have to deal with adjusting the strength of the flash.It is a big plus for people who wants a step up from point and shoot, yet want a semi-portable camera that's not too heavy.

The military has Nikon D3Xs that I can use at work... but for most jobs that I do it's a bit of overkill.  ANd, the fact that carrying a D3X around all day will wear me out due to the size prompted me to buy this Sony.I've shot with this for about a year and a half and have beat the hell out of it.  Very durable and the quality of photos is fantastic.  You can see my photos online by searching my photo ID number \"ZC343\".  About 98% of the images you will see with that ID are shot with the Sony NEX 5.I have several lenses for it including the 16mm, 18-55mm, 18-200mm and a fisheye.  I just got the new 55-210mmm and have only used it once.  They all work well with the camera and my favorite is the 18-200.  That lens is expensive, but worth every penny.  Just be careful and don't drop the lens like I did.  I cracked the casing of the lens and now have a bit of dust inside.  The camera, which was attached at the time suffered no damage, thankfully.I highly recommend this camera and will probably buy the NEX 7 within the next 6 months.", "Date": "December 22, 2011"}, {"Title": "Awesome", "Author": "Rick", "ReviewID": "R3DO5UOWWAAP3I", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This camera is awesome.

I had this camera in my hand or slung around my neck constantly.Upsides.This camera proved very easy to use, easy to quickly pull out and take an impromptu shot (camera starts quickly and adjusts settings quickly when on point-and-shoot mode).  It takes high quality pictures (I got this camera for the sole purpose of improving upon the quality of my point and shoot - this more than does the trick).  Has a moderately low profile: the lens is bulky, but the body is slim.  Some professional reviews have dinged it for its small body and the resulting difficulty of holding the camera one-handed.  This may be true for some people, but I have found it very easy to use one-handed.Downsides.The major difficulty is accidentely taking video.  The video starts with a one button push, and is located near frequently used buttons.  My wife and I found it difficult to (a) avoid the video button, and (b) stopping the video once it starts.  This was a minor annoyance - I have not found anything else to not like about this camera.", "Date": "January 1, 2013"}, {"Title": "Great camera, but not prefect", "Author": "TonyZ", "ReviewID": "R1OZKG7YZY05N0", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Pros:1. Exceptional color renditionYou will be amazed by how stunning the color rendition in produced images is. It is rich and impressive. With Sony Image Data Convertor, you can make even deeper saturation to make your images more attractive.2. Sharp imagesOf course sharpness heavily depends on what lenses you are using. For most non-Zeiss E-mount lenses, it is pretty sharp. But not razor sharp though, unless you use the E-Mount Carl Zeiss one, or third-party lenses using adapters.3. Rich creative image effectsI think this could one of the sweetest functions that NEX has. Without too much effort, you will be able to take many artistic style images which looks pretty cool.4. Light weightIt makes your life easier when you are traveling. You can even put it in your pocket if you use the 16mmF2.8 'pancake' lens.Cons:1. Serious chromatic aberration in some situationsAs far as I know, the purple fringing happens in lenses of 50mmF1.8, 18-55mmF3.5-5.6, 55-210mm and 16mmF2.0. Not sure about the Carl Zeiss one though. After you shoot images in high-light\\high contrast scenarios, don't enlarge your images to see the high contrast edges. The ghostly purple fringes would make you feel disappointed.2. Cumbersome operationsThis is not a real SLR for sure, so you'd better not expect fast & simple operations to set ISO\\Aperture\\Shutter speed. Usually you would have to go up to 3 levels of menu items to set something up.3. Slow focusNot like real SLRs, it is using Contrast focusing method (I hope I'm using the correct terminology here). It requires longer time to find the correct focus. So just forget instant captures with this camera.4. No viewfinderIt could be really hard to plan a good composition in bright light situations.--In a word, Sony NEX-5N is for ones who take photography for fun only, and who are not pixel-level perfectionist. It is the right choice for semi-professionals.

My largest problem is with the LCD washing out in daylight.  There is an electronic viewfinder available, but it is very expensive.But as I said the photos are great - better than I had expected, so I'm happy.

And when I get good focus, I do love it.  The in-focus pictures are gorgeous.  The camera has a very convenient form factor, a good and growing selection of lenses, and a wonderful image sensor that rivals most full size DSLRs.  It is also the best video camera I've ever owned.However, the camera just does not focus reliably in medium-to-low indoor lighting conditions.  As a father of three, my kids are most often my photographic subjects, and that means I'm usually shooting in these less than ideal conditions.  Most recently I took pictures of my daughter's birthday party, which was in a restaurant, and the camera missed focus over half of the time.  This is just not acceptable.I have searched the web for solutions to this problem because, again, I love this camera when it works, and I want the problem to be my fault.  I have found several suggestions for improving the focus, and some of them have resulted in minor improvements, but the bottom line is that autofocus in low light is simply a limitation of the type of focusing system used by this camera.  It is the same system used by camcorders, known as \"contrast-detect autofocus,\" or CDAF.  This is different from \"phase-detect autofocus,\" PDAF, which is used in DSLRs.  With my former Canon DSLR (60D), the autofocus would literally work in a completely dark room (using the assist beam from the flash).  However, the 60D, as with most DSLRs, does not focus during videos, which is why I changed systems.According to some research I've done, micro four third cameras from Panasonic and Olympus have a better CDAF system than the NEX.  However, my understanding is that *all* CDAF systems suffer from this difficulty in focusing in low light situations.  For this reason, I'm selling my NEX and I plan to purchase a Sony SLT camera, which has full-time PDAF, even during movies, thanks to a unique mirror design.So, if you're planning to shoot mainly outdoors, I think this camera is a great choice.
