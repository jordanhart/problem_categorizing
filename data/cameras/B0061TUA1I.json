I researched and read the description and thought this unit would meet my needs.  The instructions that come with the unit covers what is in the box, the controls, and how to work the unit.  It said NOTHING about how to connect it. I probably could have figured it out but when I saw that everything needed to be plugged in, I loss interest.  The description stated \"simple security solution with no wires.\"  Silly me, I expected no wires.  Okay, I didn't put much thought into how these units would be powered but when it said \"no wires\", I was thinking batteries not an electrical cord.If you are fortunate to have an outlet near where you want to put a camera, this may be the unit for you.  All of of my outlets are near the ground.", "Date": "July 22, 2012"}, {"Title": "CLOVER", "Author": "Debbie", "ReviewID": "RLMYZNXFQQQR6", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "GREAT OBSERVATION SYSTEM, WOULD BE BETTER IF YOU COULD GO THROUGH THE VIDEOS AND BE ABLE TO STREAM THEM  WITH A BETTER CONTROLLER.
