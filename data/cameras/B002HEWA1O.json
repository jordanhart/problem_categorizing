Latif \"SML\"", "ReviewID": "R11YBYBB1JU6KP", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "I bought this camera about a momth ago on newegg for under $80, and for the price it's not bad.  It's small, stylish, has a large lcd and in general takes good photos.  It uses AA batteries which in general I dislike because they tend to have a worse lifespan compared to proprietary camera batteries but I was impressed with the lifespan of two cheap NIMH rechargeables.  I could easily take 150 photos with flash before thinking about recharging.  The biggest problem I had with the camera was picture quality.  Outdoors in sunlight it takes ok photos but in low lights pictures can turn out blurry even with the flash turned on.  In addition there really isn't a macro mode.  I tried to use it to take photos of food dishes during a recent trip to a restaurant but the photos didn't turn out well.  I think that if you're not willing to spring the extra $20-$40 for a Canon (which I've had excellent success with) then this is a decent alternative.", "Date": "October 19, 2009"}, {"Title": "Great Basic Digital Camera", "Author": "Hummingbirder \"Don't ask for a man's soul whe...", "ReviewID": "R379J8CGZ1N6JX", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "This is by no stretch of the imagination a professional quality camera, and not really for the camera enthusiast.  But for those of us who just want something to capture the moment, it's pretty dandy.  I bought it to replace my older Fuji Finepix, which is a 6 MP and costs 3 times as much.  I do like Fuji products.  I think the quality is very good for the price point.Though I bought it primarily for a point and shoot, I do like the extra features:  the timer, manual settings, and video recording option.  The playback sound on the video isn't good on the camera, but on the television or downloaded to my MP3 player, it's fine.  The picture quality is very good, except sometimes in low light or with a lot of shadow.  In those situations, the dark areas of the photos come out very dark, and the lighter color objects are very bright.  The result is the photo has more contrast than the object being captured.  To overcome this, I leave the shutter exposure very long and put the camera on a stable surface OR add lighting before taking the photo.I advise taking the time to read the user's manual, and keep it handy at first.  But it doesn't take long to learn how to get the most from this camera.  This is a nice workhorse camera, suitable as a first camera, or something easy to learn for someone who hasn't used digital cameras before.  And it's not a wallet-buster.

Ault", "ReviewID": "R2AT51VB42NU0P", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I'm a relative newcomer to digital photography.  After many years as a casual photo enthusiast using 35mm SLRs long ago, I had a long dry spell of inactivity; earlier this year, I picked up a used Nikon D60 to see if going digital might rekindle my interest via the reduced hassles and cost of shooting in that mode.  It was fun, and I had good results, but found myself envying the portability, versatility and ease of use (and startlingly good image quality) of my partner's Fujifilm Finepix Z10fd.  So I decided to grab one of the small units for myself.  The Finepix A220 boasted 12.2Mp resolution, and our experience with the other Fuji led me to expect that this had a good chance of being a decent unit.  While I agree with the reports from others that shutter response is often a bit slow, I've encountered this problem with autofocus cameras of all types; only my old manual-focus mechanical-shutter cameras were 100% reliable about immediately taking the shot when the shutter button was pressed.  If that issue is handled better with high-end units, then obviously that's one of the defining qualities of the upscale models.  Another minor disappointment is in the handling of the zoom feature; the optical zoom has just 5 stepped settings, and does not permit zooming to a point between any of them.  Once again, this is probably an item that the higher-priced models handle better.  Using the macro mode, the image resolution and sharpness of the A220 is good enough to allow clearly reading the text on a page of the phone book which was shot from the range at which it filled the frame, and color rendition seems very good indoors; outside, some washout seems to happen in very bright settings, as is often true with film as well.  The bottom line, to me, is that this tiny AA-battery-powered box takes pictures with resolution equal to what I used to get from 35mm film, it can take the equivalent of many rolls of film worth of images without needing anything more than an occasional fresh set of cheap batteries, it can focus down far enough to image remarkably small subjects, and its cost of operation is essentially negligible.  Many of these attributes are true for the majority of digital cameras, but in my opinion, this is one of the best bang-for-the-buck units I've seen.  I'll probably use this a lot more than the Nikon, to be quite honest.", "Date": "December 30, 2009"}, {"Title": "Very disappointing", "Author": "Stevo", "ReviewID": "R1IZ2FX7JGFH4Y", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I purchased this for my wife for xmas so that we could take it to the Dominican Republic for vacation. Well the scenery was fantastic but this camera destroyed that. We had it set on scene recognition thinking it would take the best photos under whatever conditions existed (night,day,landscape etc..) The pictures came out blurry, grainy or a combo of both a lot of time. Even in the \"good\" photos which required perfect lighting, the detail you would have expected from a 12mp cam was way worse than a 3mp cam I've owned in the past. The directions are poor at best. It's not a booklet but a foldable paper leaflet that rips easily & that lacks detail/specific info. Under the picture quality settings, they don't even explain what the settings mean, just that they exist. You are expected to know I guess and I'm not new to digital cams in the least. The cover that closes in the batteries and the SD card slips open constantly as you are handling it which is really annoying and we had to tape it just to secure it! Forget taking pictures in low lighting. The majority were absolutely terrible. Spots & graininess. My first Fuji and after it's returned, my last.", "Date": "January 11, 2010"}, {"Title": "MAGIC CAMERA!", "Author": "N.

It's provides you with the freedom of knowing that you will always have battery life. So, to those of you who do not like the buying of batteries on the go, no worries, you can use re-chargeable batteries with it.It takes absolutely BEAUTIFUL photos. I want to take one of everything I see! It's nice and it's slim and a variety of scenes to choose from when taking pictures. It even has a BABY MODE, which is suitable for babies skin and such. And I have a lil' one so that's great.The sound quality of the videos are great.Uploading photos to my computer was easy.I love it so much I purchased a Case Logic Medium Case for it's maximum protection.Good luck and believe me, I'm a picky person. I spent A MONTH researching for the best camera for $100. This one is better than I expected. As you should know, the descriptions of products don't always tell you EVERYTHING. Therefore, there are always good and/or bad suprises. I am extremely pleased.UPDATE: I no longer own this camera, after a year of use, the zoom lens got stuck when turning it on. It was good while it lasted. I upgraded to the Samsung Dual Camera. Awesome! Should check it out!", "Date": "March 5, 2010"}, {"Title": "excellent buy", "Author": "M. Takahashi", "ReviewID": "R3FK9A09M0827I", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I have had this product in use for a couple of weeks.The camera is an excellent value for the money.  It has all the functions a casual photo taker would want and maybe some features you would hardly ever use.  I haven't tried the movie feature and I am unsure if the format is suitable for e-mails or for transfer to CD or DVD, but those are features I wouldn't ordinarily use.I have one complaint and that is that the data transfer cable with a miniature USB on one end, and a standard USB on the other does not slip easily into the camera's USB slot.  I have to kind of carefully align it then forcefully push it in.  Then it seems not to seat all the way to the base of the USB cable plug but only about a few millimeters.  Haven't had any problems with the actual data transfers to my computer but it makes me nervous because the only other way you would have to transfer data would be to load directly from the memory card, and I don't have that kind of port on my computer.The quality overall is pretty good and even though the product is made in China rather than Japan, I am hoping it performs as well over the years as my old Fuji FinePix S5000.", "Date": "December 28, 2009"}, {"Title": "Exactly what my husband needed", "Author": "Bectile \"bectile\"", "ReviewID": "R3QITO33FD3ZSD", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "He wanted a very simple digital camera with a large LCD screen and this camera is perfect!
