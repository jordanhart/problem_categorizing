Thought it was just a cheap one.  Boy am I happy with it.  It has so many features that the book is 180 pages long.  All the light condition compensations realy work well.  I go inside and turn off the flash.  You do not need it, camera compensates.  I used 35mm single lens cameras since 1952, and lost my Pentax just before I got the R507.  Do not want a 35mm now.  Get extra battery and the 1 gig SD chip.  Gives 8,400 pixs on lowest res.  Suggest you buy any R, (not M) series.  New R817 has 5X optical zoom, 40X total.", "Date": "December 13, 2005"}, {"Title": "Fun, Inexpensive, Great Warranty Coverage, and Fits in the Palm of Your Hand", "Author": "Roger Williams", "ReviewID": "R3S6ZOMD3Y8Z9J", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This is my first digital camera. I've always had good experiences with HP products, and this camera is yet another one to add to my list. I love that it has both optical AND digital zoom features. Secondly, it's quite handy and tiny that you can fit it in an average pants, coat or even shirt pocket. Finally, the warranty is simply amazing. This past new year's eve, during the fireworks and festivities downtown, I slipped the device into my pocket along with the car keys. The car keys punctured the quick-view window, BUT HP kindly replaced it with a brand new camera! Yes, the warranties don't last long, but it certainly offers great coverage in the meantime. If you are a first-time or amateur digital photographer, you will have tons of fun with this camera. It's really fun to use and at a reasonable price.", "Date": "January 13, 2006"}, {"Title": "HP Cameras don't last very long", "Author": "T.

This camera was an upgrade from one that broke down a month after the warranty was up, and that one was an upgrade from one that broke 2 months after the warranty was up. I'm not getting another! None of the 3 HP cameras I had could be repaired. The only option I was offered was to upgrade. For the upgrade I sent my old camera back and paid slighly less that I would if I bought a new one. They sent me a \"new\" camera. It was a refurbished camera, not new. None of the damage on any of my 3 cameras was through carelessness or misuse. The first 2 cameras gave me error messages and shut off. I was told this was an internal problem that could not be fixed. On the third camera the screen went blank. It can't be fixed. I'm going to do a lot of research before buying my next camera, but one thing I'm sure of - it won't be an HP!", "Date": "July 10, 2008"}, {"Title": "Excellent", "Author": "Campor", "ReviewID": "RBNRJPKK9Q964", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Camera arrived well packaged and with all necessary accessories,, works greatand has all the functions I appreciate in a small, compact digital camera.The price was good  tooLouis", "Date": "October 3, 2012"}, {"Title": "good while it lasted", "Author": "Brain", "ReviewID": "R1YLYTDOUPRHZ8", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "bought this camera for a class and it gave me many problems, but when it worked it worked well.
