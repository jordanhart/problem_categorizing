{"Reviews": [{"Title": "SX40 HS is superior", "Author": "Robert Goodrich", "ReviewID": "R159VEKUCWO26Y", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "Last years SX40 Hs has superior performance with its somewhat shorter 35x zoom but with better overall optics. AtCanon's website the SX50 is $399 and the SX40 is $429. Give the SX50 another year and Canon will have it rightbut for now I just went with the SX40 and love it. Be sure to get a mono or tripod to take full advantage of theawesome zoom lens. I also went with Canon's lens hood for $25 and Case Logic # 304 case - snug but like it thatway.", "Date": "January 10, 2014"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": "$399.00", "Features": null, "Name": "Canon Digital Camera PowerShot SX50HS 12.1MP x50 Optical Zoom PSSX50HS (Japan Imported) (Japan Imported)", "ImgURL": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41B5HvryRlL._SX300_.jpg", "ProductID": "B009D8DHOG"}}
