Mitchell", "ReviewID": "R9SUMZOXQ939T", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I bought this camera a few days ago(in blue). I thought it would be a great deal, when I was looking at it in the store the reviewed pictures looked amazing! so I figured that since I have always had Kodak cameras then this one was the right one for me(I just wanted a simple point and shoot camera) when I got home and started using the camera I noticed the pictures to be a bit grainy. I uploaded them onto my computer and every picture was blurry even though they looked great on the LCD screen. I thought it was because I had it on the wrong setting so I practiced taking the same picture(of my sleeping dog) on every different setting and they all came out the same. the only good thing about this camera is that the battery is a Lithium Ion battery so you don't have to worry about the batteries dying like with AA's. In the end, I returned it less than 48 hours after taking it home.", "Date": "October 23, 2007"}, {"Title": "Slow....", "Author": "Sig VanDamme", "ReviewID": "RBX3ZQT0BJD5D", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "I bought this, used it for two days, and returned it....The flash was very slow; I would press the button to take a picture and it there would be a very noticeable pause before the camera took the picture.Also, it does not come with a traditional charger; only a USB charger (not very useful when there is no computer around).Those are the only two issues I had with the camera - other than that is was very nice.I ended up buying a cannon - my first non-kodak digital camera.  I worked for Kodak and live in Rochester and it pained me to buy another brand but for the money, the cannon was superior.", "Date": "November 15, 2007"}, {"Title": "Bought for my girlfriend for Xmas", "Author": null, "ReviewID": "R1RQ99XKSOLXFH", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I am very pleased with this camera.  I bought it for my girlfriend for Xmas.  Purple is her favorite color so that made the choice easier.  I was considering several other cameras though.  The Kodak has easy menus.  I liked the delete and review buttons because she is a little tech. challenged.  Also, whenever you change modes, it tells you in words on the screen what that mode is used for, so she's never confused.  Very comparable picture quality and zoom to other cameras in this range.  She commented on the ease of use as well.  We both liked that it automatically turns vertical pictures horizontally after you take them.", "Date": "December 26, 2007"}, {"Title": "Nice little camera", "Author": "Bernardo V. Sumadchat \"just fine\"", "ReviewID": "R3LI9W75VITWN3", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "I bought this camera as a valentines gift for my wife as she has been asking for a digital camera for a while.  I wanted to get her a digital camera that was simple enough to use takes good pictures and something that was handy and not bulky at the right price.  I went to the stores and tried to do my research at the store and online I read what other people said about this camera and how they rated it.  I compared this brand with other more expensive brands and realized that this camera at times had better features than other more expensive brands, like having a speaker which is useful for playing back videos.  We have been using this camera for about a month now and so far we have been very satisfied, now it might not take as good a picture as other higher end digital slr camera  with much bigger lenses  but compared to other cameras in it's class it is a great deal.  One of the features I liked with this camera is it has a rechargeable battery , you can plug it on your computer and you save money instead of buying batteries.  On a full charge you could probably take about 200 pictures which I think is good because I have a digital slr which is just so power hungry that I usually take about 4 extra batteries whenever we have a family affair just to make sure I don't run out of batteries.  Now let me make it clear that this is a good camera that is decent enough for regular affairs and regular holidays but if it's  a special event like weddings I suggest that you get a better more expensive digital slr, but for vacations , outings it is ok , it's handy you could just put it in your pocket and use it anywhere.  I rate this camera a 3.5 star,  my  wife on the other hand loves it and has become quite an amateur photographer. This is a great 2nd camera and for the money you can't go wrong.", "Date": "March 14, 2008"}, {"Title": "Great Product", "Author": "V.

This item is a gift, and will not be given to the individual until the end of June.

One thing that you should know:  the software for the computer will not work for the computer if it is really old.  Our computer was built in like, the 1700s, and we had to go to kodak.com and get a lower version of software.  But other than that, this camera would work for anybody, and it's SO CUTE!  I'm in love with it.  It comes with a wriststrap, so you won't ever drop it if you use the wriststrap.  It also comes with the rechargeable battery and a USB charger.  The USB charger is kind of not useful, becuase you can't charge the camera if there isn't a computer around. (At least our ancient computer can charge it.) But there is an available traditional charger, but you have to buy it separately.  That's kind of a bummer.I also bought the Kroo camera case with it, and I'm very pleased because we weren't sure if it would fit the camera, but it did, so you can be assured that it will fit this camera.  I bought the Centon 1GB SD memory card too, and it is definitely the right size for the camera, and it holds over 300 pictures and over 120 minutes of video.  Soooooooo... your rest be assured, you can be happy with this camera, and you will be happy with the accessories you buy with it.  :-)  (Hi Mom!!!)", "Date": "May 29, 2008"}, {"Title": "Sister's birthday gift", "Author": "F.
