Beware, GVI is no longer in business.  I've used Samsung SHR dvrs and this one lacks some of the graphics.  For example, it lacks the graphical visual aid to search for events.  It has a event log but no graph-bar.The DVR has an embedded program for a pc interface.  I have google chrome and IE 9 on my computers.  I was unable to get it to run with either.  I'm not a techie so I hired a pc support company to help.  The technician was not able to get it to run with either of these, although, he did finally get it to work with IE 8.  Just a heads up.My DVR did not come with a full manual.  As of this posting you can still download it from the internet.", "Date": "August 7, 2012"}, {"Title": "Samsung GVI AR-6160", "Author": "Budro", "ReviewID": "R3V6XOXJYH91SV", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "IP Cam Viewer app (Free) will work for remote viewing on an android phone.
