It weighs a flippin' TON fully filled out but back in the day I'd never be able to afford this camera. Remember when your old film SLR felt too heavy to carry around? That's nothing compared to the tank-like F4. My Canon G12 seems puny in comparison and my Nikon D5100's like a Crackerjack toy as well, and they're both very good cameras. Right now this is a novelty but takes exceptional shots once you get used to it.", "Date": "June 3, 2013"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": null, "Features": null, "Name": null, "ImgURL": null, "ProductID": "B000LDBYNI"}}
