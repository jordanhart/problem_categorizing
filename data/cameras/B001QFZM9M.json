{"Reviews": [{"Title": "A GREAT little camera!", "Author": "M. Edwards \"fpmdsc\"", "ReviewID": "R24555B4DLZIC7", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Okay - so I wrote an unfavorable review a few weeks ago about this camera because I received one (from [...] through Amazon Marketplace) that was DOA.  [...] is very difficult to deal with, so I would not recommend ordering anything from them in case there is a problem with your item.  That said...I LOVE THIS CAMERA!  For such a low price it takes unbelievably great shots.  Even my wife (who is a professional photographer and who has a high-end Canon Digital-SLR camera) was amazed at what this little point-and-shoot can do.  It adjusts for light unbelievably well.  Its face recognition feature assures that faces will be in focus (no matter where they are in the shot).  I even waved this camera up and down and took a shot to see how it would turn out - and it was clear as if I had been holding the camera steady.  For me the best part is the automatic setting because I can just aim and push the button to get incredible photos.  But there are plenty of options to change and adjust if one is so inclined.  So, the bottom line from someone who is not a camera buff but who just wanted an easy-to-use small camera to pop in my pocket for casual picture-taking: BUY THIS CAMERA!  You will not be disappointed!!!  (And you can't beat Amazon's price or their customer service.  So buy it from Amazon.com!!! And, no, I don't work for them!)", "Date": "May 7, 2009"}, {"Title": "Absolutely Perfect", "Author": "TSA", "ReviewID": "R2OK49PL7E1KRV", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I was in the market for a 10mp point & shoot camera, and was going back and forth because the Canon & Sony's are always top rated.  Panasonic is a great brand, but maybe not the FIRST name you think of.  I did a little researching and narrowed it down to a 10mp Sony or a 10mp Panasonic.  I felt (when compared side by side) all I was paying more for in the case of the Sony, was the name.  I bought the Panasonic, and it's NO JOKE.  It's compact, light, has almost NO shutter lag, and is very user friendly.  So far it's been used for stationary pics, pics of my two (quick & active) dogs, and it's performed beyond what I expected.  I have not used the zoom, so I can't comment on that.  I will say, that every other feature is as good, or better than the big names out there- and I've previously owned a Canon and Sony digital camera.", "Date": "July 5, 2009"}, {"Title": "Highly recommended!", "Author": "M. Cotterman", "ReviewID": "R126OGKKM5835T", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I bought this camera for my boyfriend for Christmas and gave it to him shortly after he proposed. Needless to say we've used it quite a bit and I am buying another for my mother's birthday present.It's quite user-friendly so I would highly recommend it for technophobes (such as my parents) but takes great pictures for someone in my age group who only wants a point-and-shoot that they can take anywhere.", "Date": "March 3, 2010"}, {"Title": "Good value", "Author": "Scott Sowerby", "ReviewID": "RJ4R1IZFUQBJC", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I've been using this camera for a week and am happy with the purchase so far.", "Date": "July 7, 2010"}, {"Title": "Value for money. I'm happy with it.", "Author": "Rasika", "ReviewID": "R1KNKESQPGMCBU", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "This a very good portable camera for day time photography. Built in flash is not that powerful. Photos are in natural colors. Sharpness and contrast are really good too.I'm a happy buyer...if you are looking for portable camera this is a good choice with good battery life.", "Date": "September 24, 2009"}, {"Title": "At least it is inexpensive", "Author": "egale", "ReviewID": "R1YTD8UB8H8565", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "This camera feels reasonably well made although not as well as the Canon line. But, as compared to the Canon SD780, its about $100 less. Picture wise, it is not as good as the SD780 although that is not saying much. The camera has basically two modes automatic and \"manual\". One nice feature is that you can set up the camera not to use an ISO higher than a certain number. The camera lacks a viewfinder so on a day when the sun is bright and the screen is washed out, you will be out of luck.The pictures though are very very noisy even at the lowest ISOs. The camera has ISO 1600 but anything over ISO 400 is not really useable. ISO 1600 is very poor. Images are not sharp either alot of which is because of the high noise.This is an easy to use basic snapshot camera. I wouldn't use it for anything that was really important. Unfortunately, the ultra compact cameras with tiny sensors and high megapixels do not do well. I would pick this over some other offerings only because of price.", "Date": "July 7, 2009"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": "Unavailable", "Features": "10.1-megapixel resolution captures enough detail for poster-size prints\n4x MEGA optical image-stabilized zoom; F2.8 Leica DC Vario-Elmarit lens\nIntelligent Auto (iA) mode\n2.7-inch LCD screen\nCapture images to SD/SDHC memory cards (not included)", "Name": "Panasonic Lumix DMC-FS7 10MP Digital Camera with 4x MEGA Optical Image Stabilized Zoom and 2.7 inch LCD (Silver)", "ImgURL": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41hwWvRPmtL._SX300_.jpg", "ProductID": "B001QFZM9M"}}
