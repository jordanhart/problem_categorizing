{"Reviews": [{"Title": "A Very Competitive Underwater (and Land Use) Camera", "Author": "Martin A Hogan \"Marty From SF\"", "ReviewID": "RJUDLQSK3WVZ4", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This Sealife camera and housing is sturdily built and easy to operate.  Just take some time to read all the directions!In the housing, the camera has two simple buttons on top; one for on/off and one to switch from photo mode to video mode. The Sealife 12 Megapixel 5X Optical Zoom and 3-Inch LCD screen Underwater/Land Camera is the brains of this operation, with an easy setup that allows you to set it to Underwater or Land. If Underwater, then choose Camera+Flash (for use with strobe) or Camera only. Then select Snorkeling or Diving. If Snorkeling, then select <25 feet or Diving select > 25 feet. You can also adjust the Diving strobe for External Flash Auto or Manual mode. There are also detail settings for green or blue water and at < or > 25 feet. These are your automatic white balance settings. The camera also has a unique `spy mode' where you can set the camera on a small tripod or steady surface and set the timer interval in order to capture that elusive sea creature. There is a function to record a subject onto an existing background image, combing shots of two people into a single image and a setting for a Panorama Mode! The latter uses a program called Arcsoft Panorama Maker 4.0 to allow you to stitch a panoramic photo together!The shutter button is meant to be pressed halfway until a green square appears, assuring you that the picture is in focus. Full shutter pressing takes the picture. The camera really is set up just like any other `point and shoot' camera, but within the housing it has five large easy buttons (Play, Menu, Flash, Focus, Delete) that handle all the underwater functions you need. It is easy enough to do it without focusing too much on the buttons - after a while you can easily work them on night dives. There is a function for color lens as well including nine settings (usually set to Standard, but the Sepia tone is handy as well as all the standard colors. I had fun setting it to sepia while night diving with nurse sharks).", "Date": "June 28, 2011"}, {"Title": "Good point and shoot for underwater", "Author": "El Tombo \"NNPS9107\"", "ReviewID":

older version).  The earlier camera worked fine for about a year and a half and 2 trips to Hawaii before it started flaking out.  But I was never comfortable with it in the water.  I always babied it and never took it deeper than 5ft or so, even though I like to go much deeper than that.This camera I feel comfortable taking it as deep as I can go, and I'm sure scuba folks would be OK to use this to the rated depth.  Also this one floats if you drop it, so one less thing to worry over.As far as picture and video quality go, as I check head-to-head with my older pix and videos, I think the older camera probably beats this one slightly, though as you'd probably expect neither is ready for National Geographic.  Both have trouble in low light, though if you're snorkeling on top on a sunny day, that might not be too big a deal.I'm adding a short video clip from Hawaii snorkeling.  Also I'll put a few more pics on the gallery.EDIT--> Just took a look at the uploaded video.  Just wanted to say the \"waviness\" in the video is some kind of amazon processing artifact, not in the original.  Also, they seem to have bumped down the resolution quite a bit.  Not really a good demonstration of actual video.Pros:-Smallest and cheapest \"with case\" underwater camera you're likely to find anywhere.-Camera floats.Cons:-Picture and video quality is probably just one notch above your cell phone.Bottom line, here's the underwater options as I see it:1) Buy this camera for around $300-400.  I'd go with this if you need some depth or plan to go underwater a LOT.  Especially salt water.2) Buy something like the Panasonic DMC-TS3 for $200-300.  I'd buy this for occasional pool shots and bad weather photography.  Maybe a few snorkeling trips in calm water.  But expect to buy another in a few years.3) Go for a real upgrade and get something like the Canon G12 with a Canon-built housing (WP-DC34) for around $600 (wow).Frankly, if the G12 option had been this cheap 9 months ago, I probably would have gone there.  The G12 is a fine camera for outside the water too. Though the G12 with case would be much more bulky than the other 2 options for \"casual\" shooting.", "Date": "December 3, 2011"}, {"Title": "Scuba fun", "Author": "browntiger", "ReviewID": "R27LAHJKGXHANN", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I love this camera.

The way the way the O-Rings are set in the camera, it's truly just a matter of time.  You'd think a camera designed specifically to work underwater would have a better and more reliable sealing device.By comparison, we have had IkeLite cases for our Canon cameras for years (200+ dives) and have not had a single problem.  So it might be user error, but the margin for error is a LOT smaller with the Sea Life.Again, if the housings protected better, I'd have great things to say.

I didn't want to buy underwater film cameras for snorkeling around the islands.  I wanted good, digital photos on one camera.  I bought the Sealife camera and noticed that the only mechanism providing protection from water is a small and ineffective O-ring wedged in the middle of a plastic case.  This is basically an overpriced cheap digital camera sold in a cheap \"waterproof\" case.  On my first snorkeling expedition it took awful photos.  The case obscured the lens, and the color was monochrome.  On my second snorkeling, the camera's O-ring did not maintain a seal and water seeped in the case and ruined the camera.  If it wasn't for the memory card I bought separately for the camera, I would have no photos.  With the card I got 20 below average quality underwater photos.
