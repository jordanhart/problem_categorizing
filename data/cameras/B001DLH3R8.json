Gauthier \"Kimberly Gauthier, The ...", "ReviewID": "RSAC3CBJMM23L", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I ordered this DVD after watching two Nikon DVDs (my boyfriend's camera).  The Nikon DVDs were so helpful and I could barely make it through, because I wanted to go out and take pics.  I popped this DVD on the second it arrived and sat in shock at how boring it was.  I learned more about my Sony Alpha from the Nikon DVDs than from this one; and not because it doesn't teach you, it's just so boring.It would have been nice if it could at least be used as a reference to use whenever I have a good question, but I've gotten more from Scott Kelby's books (which don't reference Alphas).  Basically, I was extremely disappointed and found this to be a huge waste of money and time.Don't bother purchasing.", "Date": "April 13, 2010"}, {"Title": "Great DVD!", "Author": "Ricardo Elizondo", "ReviewID": "R12J64PVTRO9AL", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This was a great DVD and allowed me to start taking pictures and understanding my camera right away!", "Date": "August 12, 2009"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": null, "Features": null, "Name": null, "ImgURL": null, "ProductID": "B001DLH3R8"}}
