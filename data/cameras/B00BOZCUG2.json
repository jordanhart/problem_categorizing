{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Surprisingly Good For The Price", "Author": "Kenneth Depree", "ReviewID": "R2H5IVT3SIYE0D", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "July 13, 2013, UpdateI have taken more photos since writing the initial review and am even more impressed with this little camera now than I was then.  I am amazed how clear and sharp the photos are right out of the camera.I can't do as much with this camera as I can with my Canon 60d DSLR. The latter has much better zoom capability, is much better for action shots, etc., but it costs many times more than this one so you would expect it to do more.  However, for the typical family shots and street photography, this camera is a much closer second place to the 60d than I realized when I wrote the first review.And the fact that you can carry it in your pocket, always ready for use, is a huge plus.  I now find myself using this camera for family activities much more than I do the 60d.********************************************************************************************My present primary camera is a DSLR Canon 60d.  However, with its lenses, it is much too large and heavy to carry wherever I go when I am out and about.  I wanted a small camera I could carry in my pocket, one that took very good photos and did not break the bank. The Coolpix S3500 fills that need very nicely.Compared to my Canon 60d. which cost many times more what I paid for the S3500, it is a 2 or a 3.  But considering what you get for your money, the S3500 is a strong 5.The photos are clear and sharp, the colors (I have it set in \"standard\") are very natural appearing, and it handles \"noise\" up to ISO 1600 about as well as any camera.At ISO 100 & 200 there is negligible noise and an increasing amount thereafter.  But even at 1600 the noise removal software I use cleans up the photo as easily as it does my Canon 60d.  Quite surprising for a camera of this price.This camera has just about anything anyone could want for casual photography.  And it takes good photos.One thing I especially like is that it uses standard SD cards.  I'm using an 8GB card so that I will have space if I want to shoot some video.  The greater capacity of the card, the more photos and video clips it will hold.Also, both surprising and welcome, is the 7X optical zoom.  Typically cameras of this type, even more expensive ones, have an optical zoom of only 4X or 5X.(Note: This camera, like virtually all others, has both optical zoom capability and an option of digital zoom.  My advice is to make use of the optical zoom of 7X and turn off the digital zoom since all that does is to crop the photo to make the subject look larger.  With the optical zoom you can  actuallyincrease the size of whatever you are shooting.)A Quick Start guide comes with the camera.  Don't be fooled by the thickness of the book, there are only a few pages in English.h  The rest of the book is repeating the same basic information in 3 other languages.2 DVD's come with camera.  One, and the most important to me, was the user manual.  It too includes 4 languages, but you can download and save the language portion that you want. It is well done and I recommend using it when you set up the camera rather than the very basic quick start guide.  Don't install everything on your computer, just the portion in the language of your choice.The second DVD gives you tools for processing, printing, and uploading to Facebook your photos.  I didn't install it because I have other software that I use.Also in the box are a hand strap, battery, and charging device, there is no SD card, but the camera does have 25MB of internal memory that will allow you to take a few photos while you get an SD card, and no case.  You charge the battery when it is in the camera using the cable.If you are looking for a small, relatively inexpensive camera for family photos and other casual shooting, this camera deserves very serious consideration.  I'm glad I chose it even though I thought I would never own any brand except Canon.", "Date": "July 2, 2013"}, {"Title": "Exceeds expectations", "Author": "Christine Belli", "ReviewID": "R1AAE1TMTSKG7T", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "The camera exceeded my expectations.

For it's size, it seems to do just about everything except wash windows.  Very impressed.  The set up was easy and for me a pretty low learning curve was involved to get the camera in working order...Do like how easy it is to set the exposure and also to be able to turn off the flash.  Zoom and wide angle settings are excellent, and I really do like the ability to take Macro shots.  So far my captures have sharp detail.The only draw back I can see at this point is someone with large hands (a big guy perhaps) might find the function buttons difficult to manipulate since they are on the small side.

They sent a photo showing a tiny scuff mark on the back of the camera and said due to that, it wasn't covered. It makes no sense and has nothing to do with the motor to the lens going out. I never dropped or damaged the camera, but guess what the cost is to repair? Exactly the same as a new camera. DO NOT BUY THIS CAMERA. I thought NIkon was a reputable brand, but this smacks of fraud.

She is constantly taking pictures and loves posting pictures for friends and family online and always wants her pictures to be perfect.  This camera takes absolutely amazing pictures!  They are so clear and crisp, it seems as if you're looking at the real person or object, not just a photograph.  I also love the fact that you can edit photos right on the camera itself.  Also, the panoramic ability is a lot of fun and works perfectly.  It is such an easy camera to use that she was able to take it out of the box, charge it up, and start taking pictures immediately without having to even read any instructions!!

It still works fine, but it doesn't shoot video and it still uses batteries; batteries that need to be replaced every time I pick it up. UGH ! I needed a camera which shoots video as I need to tape sessions for my instructor, so I decided on this little purple gem. I'm glad I did. One of the best things about it is that it has a rechargeable battery which doesn't need replacing !Both the photos and the videos come out lovely. (I'll put up a photo of my dog in the customer photo section, if they still allow that) The photos are clear, lifelike and lit well. The camera comes with a good instruction book and a USB cable and you have the choice to download their photo software if you wish. It's a nice overall package for a very low price and if you're working with a budget, this would be a wise choice. I bought the Transcend 32 GB Class 10 SDHC Flash Memory Card to go with it as I need Fast, Fast, Fast and I want enough power to see me through any video session I tape. If you're going to shoot video over 20-30 minutes, you'll want more GBs.This Nikon COOLPIX supersedes my needs and I absolutely love it. I look forward to many years of creativity and love from this camera. Thanks, Nikon for making an affordable yet precise tool for our enjoyment. It makes all the difference in the world.

I probably upgrade about once every 1-2 years. I chose this one because it was under a hundred bucks which was a great price. I also liked the upgrade from my 16 megapixel to this 20 megapixel. However, this is the SLOWEST camera I've ever used! It takes 10-15 seconds between pictures to be able to take another one, which almost defeats the purpose of taking a picture. After taking another reviewer's advice, who suggested using a name brand or higher quality memory card might fix the problem with the slowness, it DID help with that issue a little bit. It at least made the wait time between photos a little less frustrating.After using this camera at Thanksgiving this evening, between all the trouble I had taking the photos to begin with and after getting home and seeing the photos on my computer, I just had to come back here to downgrade my original 3 star rating to a 1 star. We took photos outside around sunset, while there was still plenty of light. Between me and several other people using the camera, every person had issues with it not only being slow, but all the photos kept coming out blurry. Flash on, flash off, it didn't matter (I've never had a camera that took blurry photos with the flash on!). I tried several different settings- auto mode, indoor mode, night mode, sunset mode- the quality of the photos stayed about the same. I just could NOT get them to stop turning out blurry, and everyone was so frustrated we just gave up on taking photos altogether. After putting the photos on my computer, the quality of the photos was surprisingly horrible. They were very blurry, grainy, and either too flashy or too dark. The photos I cropped to bring the subjects of the photos in closer looked like the quality of photos my phone takes! On top of that, the 1 or 2 photos that managed to come out decent enough not to delete had white spots all over the photo- like water spots, or \"ghost spots.\" Very disappointing :(.This was my first try at owning a Nikon, and I can say with certainty I will never be owning one again. I will be reselling this one and I have ordered a Canon to replace it, which I should have done to begin with.

Second, the camera does blur on low light, speed shots.  Third, the book doesn't tell you the type of sdhc memory card to buy.  I opted for a 32 Gb Sony mini sdhc with an adapter, it is class 10 (important) uhs-1 (ultra high speed- important) that has a write speed of 40 Mb/sec and read of 50 Mb/sec., believe me there are lots of cards out there that are lot slower and you could be waiting for recovery time to take the next picture or waiting forever to upload what you have taken (you'll get a little over 5K 20.1 M/p pictures with 32 Gb, and little more than 2 hrs HD video), so make sure you get a fast SDHC card!!  Then you won't be blaming the speed on the camera!!  I've take a couple pictues with the internal memory (only get about 4 with 25 Mb internal memory) so don't expect much,  think of the internal memory as buffer.  With the SDHC C10 UHS-1 card installed, the shooting was much better and way faster.

What it does have is an 'Auto' mode, a 'Scene Selection' mode with a no. of various 'scenes' such as night, portrait, landscape etc., a 'Special Effects' mode for selecting options like vivid color, high key, sepia, black and white etc. and lastly a 'Smart Portrait' mode where it automatically detects a smile on a face in focus and activates the shutter by itself.

In flash mode, if you set a different color balance other than sunlight, it does not auto compensate and gives a bluish tint if using the flash in other light conditions. The 7x zoom is the prime reason I bought it for, but haven't yet had a chance to fully test it out. More later.12/25/2012I have used the camera for slightly over a month. Pl see the pics I uploaded. The following are my observations:a. Time lag between start-up and first shot is slightly high, compared to my Canon SD790 model. It seems to take some time to focus.b. Again, focus issue - sometimes in the middle of a series of shots, it just seems to get lost. The shutter will need to be kept pressed for a few seconds and released, before it responds and focusses again.c. Not having a manual mode and always having to work with preset settings is quite annoying. Again, my slightly 'dumber' Canon SD790 or the older SD660 had a sort of manual mode that gives more flexibility.d. Picture quality is good, though not noticeably better because of the 20.1MP.e. I have noticed that low-light pictures invariably have shake and blur, even pictures taken on twilight conditions have movement blurs. There seems to be image stabilization (I can see the icon) but have not been able to find a way to switch it on or off. Took some pictures under night condition and was not too impressed with the result. Again, the Canons performed better.f. I used this to take a series of macro shots of comic books that I was listing on eBay. Under daylight conditions, these shots were great (with a tendency to blur), but under artificial light conditions (tungsten/fluorescent) the AWB color correction was off, as was the focus. Loads of blur. Increasing the ISO from 100 to 200 and then to 400 lead to significant increase in noise.g. I honestly don't like the preset scenes and would prefer a simpler way of just taking pictures with auto focus. There is a tendency of over compensating, with excess light (over exposures) and color balance.All in all its a good camera but not an absolutely great one. I feel its a great camera for people who want fully automatic settings, but since I prefer having fiddle room, that's not too good for me.Perhaps I am not doing something right. If so, would appreciate any advise via comments.More later", "Date": "November 16, 2013"}, {"Title": "Love this camera", "Author": "judyc", "ReviewID": "RD3NG23BF21O8", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Great camera - just what I wanted.

She's been using our iPhones as a camera for years so we figured a small digital camera (with no apps or phone capabilities) might be a good gift.This is a *nice* camera. First and foremost, it's tiny. The last time I had a digital camera, it was large, bulky, and heavy. This camera is about the size of a deck of playoing cards (but thinner) and much lighter. And when the camera is powered off, the lens retracts back into the camera and is covered, so it can be slid into a pocket without the worry about scratching the lens.It's super easy to use- just power it up, aim, and click. There's a built in flash, optical zoom, plus many on-board feature, including tons of fun filters.My daughter has mastered the camera and all after its capabilities after about twenty minutes of playing with it. The photos she printed out were crisp and clear.After years of using the iPhone as my go-to camera, I forgot how nice it is to have a camera that zooms optically, takes clear photos every time, and has a decent flash. I'm tempted to get one of these for myself since I tend to take a lot of photos and having to take at least five every time with the iPhone to get a clear photo is a huge time waster.

The fabulous On-line user manual ([...] answered most of my questions before I even received this beauty.  (the on-line search capability is fantastic.) Win8 recognizes the camera and installs the driver without rebooting. Explorer then displays the S3500 under the local computer; (click) DCIM (click again) and the subdirectories on the SD card are visible.  Right clicking on S3500 displays the battery status and offers other options including my favorite import pictures into my specified directory. One of the features which convinced me to buy the Nikon S3500 is that it charges while attached to the computer.  The package includes a wall mounted battery charger.  The charger is plugged into the wall. Then the enclosed cable is attached to the charger and the camera. Most of the time, I will not need any charging beyond computer time.

The zoom is ok except that the macro doesn't work as well as they'd have you believe with a 7x zoom. But, over all, it's a great camera and would be wonderful to take on vacation or for some more artistic shots and not worry too much about what happens if you drop it.

Other than taking a few pictures during Halloween I had not used the camera until November.  All the pictures came out blurry and I zoomed in on an object, heard 2 load popping sounds....and when I looked down, the camera had busted!  The camera had literally come apart at the top seam next to the button you push to take pictures.  The zoom mechanism busted my camera that I had just gotten back from repair!!!!  So, I send it to Nikon again.  I send in a letter explaining exactly what happened and they decide that it has impact damage and that's not covered under warranty.  No scratches on the camera, no visible signs of dropping it.  But the fact that it's busted apparently means I dropped it.  The whole camera costs $100 and they want $107 to fix it.Do your self a favor, don't mess with Nikon or their customer service, or their cameras!

A multiple-shot self-timer  had helped captured PRECIOUS moments where otherwise a one-shot timer wouldn't. I tried this Nikon coolpix and I love the quality photos but when you're in the middle of Biltmore estate in an 18-degree weather,  running back and forth to your tripod to set the timer with each shot is not an option I'd like to take, I ended up taking very few shots because I was freezing to death and ultimately decided I must let go of this very nice camera because it's also about memories and multiple-shots.

It is perfect for someone who wants an easy to use pocket optical zoom camera with \"features\" for \"fun\" situations.  Learn how to use it and you will be pleased.-----------------------------------------------------------------------Why 4 stars?  Here is the story.1. For snapshots shared online and 4 x 6 and 5 x 7 prints, the images are very good.2. Macro images taken with a zoom lens \"optically optimized for normal shooting distances, they [the lenses] produce somewhat below-optimum image quality at close-up distances - particularly edge softness due to curvature of field.\" (Search on this phrase for an interesting article on the subject.)3. When significantly magnified, images appears to be a \"soft focus\" or a little less than crystal clear.  This is due to \"noise\" caused by the 20 million pixels on a small sensor about the size of your pinky fingernail. The pixels are too small to collect enough light to totally overcome the inherent electron noise in the sensor chip.  This pixel count \"overkill\" requires the camera software to \"smooth\" the image, resulting in an image that is less than crystal clear under magnification.  Example: a small sensor with 10 megapixels will result in a clearer picture than the same sized sensor with 20 megapixels. (See the website with the article \"The difference in megapixels: Does it matter and how many are enough?\"How Many Megapixels Do You Really Need?\")4. Learning when and how to use the few automatic focus options before taking important pictures is essential.  This camera (like any other camera) focuses sharply once the photographer understands how and when to use the various options.5. The camera needs an SD card with a speed rating of 6 or higher to shorten the time it takes for the camera to move the image file to the SD card.  Ditto for movies, which are quite good.  This will speed up the \"shot-to-shot\" time that has been noted as an issue.  I use a card with a speed rating of 10.6. Making the image file size one step smaller than the factory settings also speeds up the image transfer, without any noticeable loss of image clarity or fidelity.---------------------------------------------------------------------My Nikon S3500 Quality Problem and Warranty Repair ExperienceAfter reading all the mostly positive reviews and having other Nikon cameras, I bought this camera as a travel camera instead of my more expensive Canon Elph 310 HS cameras.  (Travel as in \"If a pickpocket takes my camera or if I lose it or drop it in the river, it's not that expensive, so what ever.\")I was surprised that the first photos weren't as sharp as the reviews led me to expect.  When I took it on a class field trip, our host took our group's picture.  I was on the far left, blurry and out of focus.To provide identification of the camera owner, I always take a a macro picture of my business card before we left on the trip.  It was very out of focus on the left.I contacted Nikon service, who requested a picture.  After trying a full camera reset, with the same results, she said send it to Nikon Warranty Service (which is done by Precision Camera in Enfield Connecticut, a contractor, not Nikon).  It took one week from the day USPS says Precision Camera received the camera to the day it appeared on the Precision Camera website as \"Received\". I had called after the USPS said they delivered it to them.  It took three days before someone apologetically returned my call and said they were working on it.I received the repaired camera several days later. The far left side of a Macro picture was much less blurry.  The right and left edges for non-macro pictures settings were now slightly \"soft\" focus, according to the Nikon customer service rep on the Nikon website.  (I discovered that the camera's \"view the image\" function works well with the zoom control so small areas of the image can be magnified just as one would do on a computer.)I strongly recommend that you test all the functions and review the image quality of this or any camera that you buy within one week of receipt.  If there are problems, you can quickly return it to Amazon (a superb company to do business with) for a refund or a replacement.  Otherwise, the warranty service is your only option.----------------------------------------------------------------------Here is how I took focus test pictures:1.  Using an 8 1/2 by 11 inch piece of graph paper (1/4 inch boxes), and placing a small 6\" ruler on the paper, using natural sunlight through the window, I took several Macro test shots, ensuring that the image was completely on the graph paper.2.  For normal and zoom pictures, I took pictures of the front of a house with bricks.  I took pictures of the brick exterior wall (like giant graph paper).I viewed the pictures on my computer using magnification to look at the lines and edges to determine their clarity.", "Date": "May 3, 2014"}, {"Title": "davismax riped me off", "Author": "ben", "ReviewID": "R31D86DCOYH9AW", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "davismax is nothing but a rip off!!!!!! bought a camera almost 2 weeks ago. have a problem with it and they send nothing but bullcrap!!! they stole my money as far as i can see!!! they do nothing but lie.", "Date": "April 4, 2014"}, {"Title": "It is really worth it's value", "Author": "Kaushik Biswas", "ReviewID": "R38GLNA3OYMJZF", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "With this price tag, this is really worth.

This is the camera I love to carry in a pocket or purse, and thanks to its gorgeous color and design, it's a welcome fashion accessory in addition to being extremely useful!I purchased this camera after dropping my older Coolpix camera while on vacation, and selected it because it is somewhat similar to my camera which was one of the first Coolpix cameras, without being too new and different. I like the way this Coolpix still has the familiar wheel of button controls where I can set the flash, close-up lens, date, time and so forth. I'm gradually learning my way around the newer features, many of which I'm still not fully up to speed with, such as utilizing special effects. I'm starting to enjoy how easy it is to switch from taking still shots to recording video, since it's no longer a matter of making menu selections, but rather simply involves hitting the record video button. The quality of videos and photos is the same excellent Nikon quality I've come to know and love.While some people may be put off by a delay in readiness when getting ready to take photos, I find for most purposes this camera is ready for action when needed. I love the way this S3500 includes stabilization, so when I used the zoom and took pictures of Mount Shasta out of the airplane window on a recent flight, my pictures were surprisingly sharp and clear.I haven't yet made much use of the touch screen on this S3500, as it's not one of the features I desired... but at some point I might get used to it. Truthfully, I have yet to try most of the fancy bells and whistles on this little point and shoot camera! It was so easy to start using right out of the box that I never did play the DVD movie it came with. I expect at some point I may get around to doing that, but I think it says a lot for good product design that this little camera is so easy to get up and running without instructions they're something you can do when you have time and inspiration for such things.Highly recommended!", "Date": "December 3, 2013"}, {"Title": "This good for first time users.

I used it for about a week and it sustained a bump.  It was enough to chip the finish, but I was really shocked that it took no more than that to finish it off.  To my amazement, it would never turn on, again.  I could have lied about how the chip in the finish happened, but I was truthful and told them that it had sustained an impact, but I didn't think it should have been enough to break the camera.  Their response was that the warranty was voided and an estimate that was about $10. more than I paid for the camera.  A brand new camera and they couldn't compromise the least little bit.
