{"Reviews": [{"Title": "NO SOFTWARE!  BLANK CD!  No download!", "Author": "Brian \"Big Red\"", "ReviewID": "R39PE5YI81PZUC", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "Well, I received the camera, all looked well.  Good packaging, cam looked to be in great quality.  HOWEVER....The cd they included has nothing on it.  In fact my computer prompted me to the default burning screen when I popped it in.  They seemed to have forgotten something.  Unfortunately, all that the manufacturer and seller has on their website for the product is a dead firmware update link.  No place to download the IP finding software.Before you go saying...  check your router man!  I already have.  I downloaded ip scanners and scanned all the normal ip ranges.... 192.168.1., 192.168.0., 10.0.0., etc....Nothing.  Could not locate the ip of this camera.  I'm stuck.  Hey seller!  Give me a valid download link on your crappy website.  I understand your in china but we need some love over here in the states.  Update your site with a valid download for your ip scanning software so when you include a blank cd we can go behind your shotty work and fix it ourselves.I have to rate with 1 star for quality of build until you update your site.  If I don't see it updated in the next couple of days, I'm asking for a refund.Anyone know if this cam comes with a default static ip......?  Anyone?", "Date": "April 24, 2012"}, {"Title": "okay video, heavy case,bad firmware, no support", "Author": "jamezg", "ReviewID": "R1WOCZKSJDK09Y", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "The video is good. Nice auto brightness. Hardly any dot crawl.The case and shield is solid. It has a external antenna connector.When in 640X480 video, the case is seen on the edges of the video. Not well thought out design.you can get a snapshot from it. Could not get it to stream video.Could not get it to work with my security program (motion).Tried to get it to save using FTP. gave up on that too.Data rate over WIFI was too slow to stream video.You need to run the locater software to find and setup camera.It will not associate to an AP or DHCP until run.The CD that came with it was badly scratched but the locater program ran but i could not read anything else from it.It operated on 5VDC not 12VDC. There is no audio. The cable is about 1 foot long and has a push button and Ethernet connector on the end. this needs to be weather sealed somehow.The manufactures website (Kare) is mostly broken links. Could not even find any support.Returned it.", "Date": "August 14, 2012"}, {"Title": "Good Camera", "Author": "FBS Staff", "ReviewID": "R2BPUQGYLC1T01", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Well worth the price, Good picture quality, VERY sensitive to movement / shadows (Of the Sun), Installation instuction good have been better, However buying a second one.", "Date": "March 20, 2012"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": null, "Features": null, "Name": null, "ImgURL": null, "ProductID": "B0069K1G30"}}
