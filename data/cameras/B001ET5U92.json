{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Designed for serious shooting, but fun to use!  Lots of customizations.", "Author": "Alan G.", "ReviewID": "R1BAG9VGP2N9NG", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Several months before the D90 came out, I bought a D60 to hold me over until the D90 was released.  Well, I've enjoyed using both cameras, but this one is a huge step up and more suited to an advanced enthusiast, like me. It's a real pleasure to use.ERGONOMICS - The D90 is solid, tight, and well-balanced with the 18-105 VR lens. It's always ready and it shoots very fast.  I love all the direct access buttons; they're easy to press, with good tactile feedback. And since you're not going into the menus as much, you can work faster. It's heavier than the D60, but that's OK. It's still very manageable to carry around and it fits my average-sized hand better too.  The shutter sounds different than the D60 (if that matters to you). It sounds more like a professional camera; more like a fast \"whoosh\" than a \"click-click\".  And there are so many internal customizations that you can set it up exactly as you want.LENS - Biggest surprise was the 18-105 VR lens which I expected would be ho-hum, but turned out to be pretty sharp and clear. Better results than the 18-55 VR.  We've really come a long way from the days (30 years ago) when you were cautioned to ALWAYS to buy a prime lens, NEVER the kit lens because of it's poor image quality. With computer-aided design and new technology, that's not true anymore.IMAGE QUALITY - I shoot RAW for maximum detail and the ability to adjust settings afterward if necessary - like exposure or white balance. Image quality is very good to excellent depending on your RAW converter. To my eye, best results are obtained with View NX/Capture NX, but Adobe ACR/Lightroom still do a very good job (2010 UPDATE; After using Lightroom the past year, raw conversions are beautiful and far quicker to achieve than Capture NX). When shooting JPGs using the Standard Picture Mode, images are sharp and colors are true, without over-saturation. You can always use different Picture Modes and customize any of them to get closer to the in-camera results you want. For example, you can boost saturation and contrast and save the setting as your default if that's what you like.LIGHT METER - Metering is fine and seems to be quite accurate in most cases. I use matrix metering mostly.  As with any camera, you have to get to know the meter. If I had to be VERY critical, I'd say when it's pushed, it's more likely to preserve shadows than highlights, usually when Active DLighting is on. To me that's a good thing. Another website mentioned a slightly \"over-enthusiatic\" meter in its review. The good news is: if you really feel exposure results are not to your liking (whether over or under exposed), the meter is fine-tuneable, so go ahead and customize it as you see fit.  I would just  work with the meter first -get to know the camera and adapt yourself to it before you start making any adjustments. That said, I've used the D90 in a very wide range of lighting conditions and I can truly say that while exposures may vary occasionally, they've always made perfect sense for the situation. I've never been shocked or puzzled by the output.LIVE VIEW - is great for the occasional high or low shot. I didn't think would need it, but when I had the D60, I found myself in many situations where I really could have used it. Unlike a point-and-shoot, focus is slower in this mode and shooting seems somewhat clunky. I wouldn't use Live View if I were in a rush or trying to get an important shot. It's just a nice little extra.MOVIE MODE - this is a nice novelty and may be handy in a rare moment, but I'm generally not a video camera person. I'm surprised to read that some people have made movies and commercials with the D90. I keep promising myself to use this feature more, but I don't have a tripod and I'm just too jittery and uncreative to get good cinema-like results. Moreover, from the little I've tried it, I'm not impressed - there's no autofocus during filming and the movie comes out over exposed and far from HD quality.  The user manual is not very helpful either.  But I didn't purchase the camera for this feature, so I'm not disappointed.ISO - I really like the new wide range of ISO settings, especially when coupled with the Auto-ISO setting.  Mine is customized to keep the camera at ISO 200, but kick in at 1/30. In this example, anytime lighting decreases enough for the shutter speed to drop below 1/30, the D90 will automatically compensate by raising the ISO high enough (up to an ISO limit you set) to help keep your shutter speed  at 1/30. Once the ISO maxes-out at your limit, the camera has no choice but to start bringing down the shutter speed.  Noise at high ISOs isn't an issue. In fact, you have to zoom in pretty close for it to be even slightly noticeable. I use Auto-ISO mostly all the time. Its an amazing feature! I only turn this feature off when I want to stick to a particular ISO at all times (if its on a monopod or I've stabilized the camera in some way).ACTIVE D-LIGHTING - helps camera to preserve shadow and highlight detail. More important to use when shooting JPG because the exposure has to be right at the time of shooting, when the camera creates the JPG. RAW shooters can always adjust exposure in post processing. Even though I shoot RAW, I usually leave it on Auto so I can double check the exposure details on the LCD screen. It's available in various strengths from Low to Extra High.  Again, another great customization.CONS-At this price, Nikon should include a robust image editing software, or at least a decent discount on Capture NX2, which works great, but costs extra.-Kit lens is thick in diameter (67mm). Also, the front glass of the lens seems somewhat exposed, as if it's not recessed that much (it's just enough for a lens cap). I worry that it'll get scratched easily. Good thing Nikon included the lens hood.AUTOFOCUS TIP - I customized the D90 to autofocus using the AF-L button instead of the shutter release. Now I can focus with one press of my thumb on the AF-L button and shoot with my index finger on the shutter release. This allows me to focus first, let go, then take the shot. Since the subject is already in focus, I can take multiple shots, recompose or go vertical. I'm not forced to continually re-focus for every shot or move the AF point around in the viewfinder. This minimizes AF mishaps on unintentional subjects. And since the VR system remains off until you half-press the shutter (it activates only when you're ready to take the shot, not while you're focusing) you save on battery life as well.Also, with the D90 set to AF-C mode (continuous autofocus) you can keep a moving subject in focus by holding down the AF-L with your thumb and shooting with your index finger. If the subject becomes still, simply let go of the AF-L button; focusing stops and is locked where you left it. Then shoot when ready. Now your D90 can act as if it's in Single or Continuous AF mode without you having to change settings all the time. This gives you more immediate control over the behavior of the AF system  Try it and you won't go back!SUMMARY - Overall I'm extremely happy with the D90! It's designed for serious shooting, but it's still fun to use; noticeably heavier than the D60, but still not a burden. You do need to be committed to carrying around a solid DSLR in the first place. Once you get used to that, you'll come to appreciate that it's more substantial because it'll be less shaky during shots. Nikon really packed it with a ton of features and customizations. Now I finally have everything I want in a DSLR, without it being overblown and overpriced. I'm actually surprising myself with some really spectacular shots.If you have your basic photography skills down, you can make any DSLR sing, however,  I believe THIS camera, because of its superb sensor and spot-on feature set, can actually help you improve your technique and get better results. You'll take more chances and push  yourself farther because now you have the tools (ie. features) to help capture more difficult, more creative shots. And you didn't have to spend $3,000 to get there!8-MONTH UPDATE: Still love this camera which hasn't lost any of its original excitement. Very reliable - never frustrating.  I'm not craving an upgrade - not contemplating a switch to Canon either - I'm perfectly content. Haven't discovered any hidden quirks. In fact, the longer I use it, the more I realize how well engineered it is.  The only extras I bought so far were a light monopod and a 50mm 1.8 lens.", "Date": "October 20, 2008"}, {"Title": "You can tell the D90 was designed by photographers and not just engineers! Wonderful user interface and image quality!", "Author": "E. Kim", "ReviewID": "RQJ3HB8ACSRRG", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I am far from a professional photographer, but I take it as seriously as possible while still referring to it as a hobby. I take mostly pictures of people at events and many of my baby son without flash in low light situations.I had been using a Nikon D40x for 1 year and very early reached my limitation with that camera. The Nikon D40x has very nice image quality, but the camera's interface is not suited for a more serious shooter who wants quick single button or dial access to such shooting parameters such as white balance, shooting mode, metering mode, etc. I also felt very limited by the D40x not having an in-body focus motor that would allow me to use non AF-I/AF-S lenses (which are lenses without the focus motor built-in).The Nikon D40x limitations were severe enough that I was about to consider purchasing a Canon 40D until the Nikon D90 appeared just in time.PROS:1. Fantastic set of separate buttons on the camera to control parameters like ISO, white balance, metering, autofocus, image quality, shooting mode, etc.2. Two command dials3. High resolution 920K pixel LCD screen (like the one on the Nikon D300)4. 12.3 megapixel CMOS sensor5. Low noise high ISO capability (for low light shooting) I can shoot ISO 1600 with good image quality with this camera, while on my D40x I could only shoot with ISO 400 and obtain acceptable IQ.  I will even use ISO 3200 frequently with very usable results!6. Separate top-viewing LCD screen in addition to the rear high res screen, to show shooting parameters constantly7. In-body focus motor which allows the use of Nikon's non AF-I/S lenses, including wonderful and CHEAP prime lenses such as the Nikkor 50mm 1.8 (~$100 lens!)8. Continuous shooting of 4.5 frames per second9. Small size, although larger than the D40/D40x/D60, it is still substantially smaller in the hand than the D300/D310. 720p 24fps MPEG video shooting capability with incredible ability to use depth of field that I cannot achieve with my Sony High-Def camcorder.11. Eleven auto-focus points (not as nice as the 51 points on the D300, but substantially better than my D40x with its 3 points)12. GPS option13. HDMI output14. Enormous number of options to customize camera and shooting settings to fit your style of shooting15. Fantastic image quality right out-of-box if you don't want to do any post processing16. Terrific build quality17. Top notch camera ergonomics (but this will be a very personal opinion that differs for each shooter)CONS:1. \"Rolling shutter\" phenomenon while recording video: The D90 CMOS sensor has the same problem that other CMOS video recorders have when recording video. If you move the camera, especially horizontally, you get a \"jelly\" or \"rubberbanding\" effect where the image wobbles significantly. It is nice to have the video features, which looks very sharp at 720p, but it is NOT a substitute for a video camera. If you use a tripod, and do not do quick zooms/pans, the video quality is excellent. Without a tripod, however, you may get nauseous watching a wobbly video. The sound is also in monoaural.2. 1/200 flash synch: Not a problem for me, but it might be for you.3. No weather sealing: This is found on the Nikon D300/D3 and even on similarly priced models from other camera companies4. The buffer will fill up after about 8 continuous RAW + JPG (FINE) shots.  This number differs depending on the shooting parameters that you will choose.  If you shoot primarily JPG, the buffer seems to allow a very large number of continuous shots, but I have not quantified this for JPG only.TIPS:1. Get the FREE Nikon ViewNX software from Nikon's site as your 1st step in your workflow. This will let you examine your RAW images that you can process for either Nikon CaptureNX2 to do further RAW processing or just export to JPG or TIFF for a JPG/TIFF editor such as PhotoShop.2. Recommend buying the Nikon CaptureNX2. It is a RAW converter (if you shoot in RAW) that will read the camera settings properly for export to JPG or TIFF. Capture NX2, however, is not as slick as the Adobe products and Capture NX2 requires a fairly powerful computer, otherwise it can run pretty slowly on a PC > 3 years old.3. If you use JPEGs out-of-camera, consider increasing the sharpness above the default 3 or 4.  Nikon uses a very conservative sharpening default setting.  Nikon has also decided to change the default JPEG images to match the higher end D3/D700/D300 cameras which produce more neutral images. Consequently, the D90 images that are less punchy than the D40/D40x/D60/D80, so you may also want to turn up the in-camera saturation and contrast.The Nikon D90 has all of the interface features that serious and even professional photographers need with wonderful image quality.", "Date": "September 28, 2008"}, {"Title": "Wow! is all I can say....", "Author": "Earl E. A. Dopter", "ReviewID": "R3ASYXNXP18OYM", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "There are plenty of reviews out there, and I don't want to be redundant. So here are some helpful points that I had a hard time ferreting out when doing my research before pulling the trigger on this purchase, given that I was upgrading from a D60 and that I am, like many who are reading reviews on this product, not a professional:1. I owned the D40, then the D60. So this is my third Nikon. I had trouble deciphering how my lenses, purchased for the D40/D60, would behave when used in this new model. The answer is that the D90 handles all of them perfectly. This includes lenses that have the HSM built in (the Hyper Sonic Motor is packaged in the lens, because the D40/D60 range doesn't have a built in auto-focus motor) as well as those with no internal motor. The D90 has an internal focus motor, so all lenses built for Nikon cameras will auto-focus, including the Nikon 50mm f1.8 lens that I had to manually focus in the D60.2. The D90 is heavier, but certainly not uncomfortable to hold or carry. Weight will not be a discouraging factor in purchasing this camera.3. The D90 takes different batteries, so any spares you have for the earlier models will not work on it. Battery life is truly outstanding. I am not even going to buy a spare battery.4. The user interface is completely different from the D40/D60. I found it intuitive however. The functionality is just superb, much easier and more flexible. This is a pro level camera with the ease of use of a high end amateur camera.5. Live view is a great enhancement. Really.Overall, there is nothing I can say negative about the D90. It's everything I was hoping it would be, and it's so worth the money to upgrade. I'm selling the D60 for half what I paid - and doing it gladly - because the D90 is worth more than it's being sold for. I absolutely highly recommend it.I also thought I would offer some lens advice, because I had trouble finding a reviewer that just cut to the chase and said \"look, just do this.\" So, look, just do this: I do NOT recommend the kit lenses that you can obtain bundled with the D90. Get the body only, and buy yourself that Nikon 50mm f1.8 (Nikon 50mm f/1.8D AF Nikkor Lens for Nikon Digital SLR Cameras). It's a no-brainer at the price point, and the images I have already achieved have been just excellent. For the rest of your lenses, I highly recommend Sigma. I own the 18-200 (Sigma 18-200mm f/3.5-6.3 DC Lens for Nikon Digital SLR Cameras), the 10-20 (Sigma 10-20mm f/4-5.6 EX DC HSM Lens for Nikon Digital SLR Cameras), and the 150-500 (Sigma 150-500mm f/5-6.3 AF APO DG OS HSM Telephoto Zoom Lens for Nikon Digital SLR Cameras). I cannot say enough positive things about the quality of the lenses or the images. Pack the 50mm and the 18-200 superlens for normal occasions. If you can stand the extra weight, you absolutely cannot go wrong with the 10-20 for landscapes, it just pulls in everything and the quality is shocking. The 150-500 is enormous, you are not going to want to carry that thing around, but when you need it, you really need it. I captured images of my son playing in a soccer game that blew me away; could not have gotten the shots without the big lens. Get the lenses in the order I have specified if you cannot afford them all.I have just learned all this over the past 2 years. I am no expert but I have discovered the joy of capturing great images that you just cannot get from a point-and-shoot. I think once you see the quality you can achieve with a better camera, you will be thrilled with the decision to spend the money and the energy. And Nikon has truly produced the best camera at this price point in the world. It's a pro camera with an amateur price and it's very easy to use. Words really don't do it justice; you need to experience it to understand.Any questions, please send me a comment. Happy to help!Update - 16 Jul 2009:I have now taken well over 4,000 images with the D90 and can confirm that it's still all I had hoped it would be. Every time I think of something I wish I could adjust, I find that the D90 has the adjustment capability in the menu somewhere. The active D-lighting is spectacular. The noiseless photos in low-light conditions have blown me away. I don't see myself upgrading from this camera for a very long time. My technique for most situations has become as follows: snap a few images using the Auto settings. Then switch to full manual and start playing with the depth of field by adjusting ISO, aperture, and shutter speed to fit the situation. Half the time, the Auto photos are so good that I can't do much to top them in manual mode!Update - 20 Jan 2010:Over 10,000 photos taken with my D90. No new lenses purchased since last update. I have yet to find a situation the D90 cannot handle deftly. Over Christmas, I took a family photo of my wife's entire extended family, over 40 people involved. It was indoors, at night, with only weak overhead lights and the lights from the Christmas tree behind the group. I used an ISO of 3500, my small Nikon 50mm lens at 1.8 aperture, and my remote control (so I could be in the photo too!) Under these low light conditions, with no flash, I was able to capture 50 images in a very short time, and miraculously got several with everyone smiling and no one blinking, and out of these one was perfect! The group included several young kids who hate standing still, to name one challenge! The output was startling; in the natural light, its almost ethereal. I'm the new family hero. The reality is that this single photo is irreplaceable and worth more than the camera and lens. It could not have been accomplished with a lesser camera/lens combination, including the previous Nikons I have owned. I would venture to say that no other camera in the price range could touch what I did with the D90 in this situation. Over and over, the camera proves its worth to me. In the end, what is one fabulous photograph of your child, your vacation, or your life's important events worth?Update - 27 April 2010:I noticed that I forgot to mention another very useful addition to the D90 - the remote control. This device allows you to remotely trigger the shutter and I find I use it for group shots much more often than the timer, especially because I can trigger multiple shots without returning to the camera. It's very inexpensive and small (I keep it in the little pouch that it comes with, threaded into the strap, so it's always there when I need it.) Here is the item: Nikon ML-L3 Wireless Remote Control for Nikon D40, D40x, D60, D80 & D90 Digital SLR Cameras. Highly recommended!Update - 13 May 2010:My D90 was stolen two weeks ago. What a bummer. Anyhow, I decided to upgrade to the D700, but not because there's anything wrong with the D90. I loved it. The D700 has the FX size sensor, whereas the D90 has the DX size sensor, which is smaller. The real benefit of the FX sensor is better sensitivity, meaning higher shutter speeds at a given aperture. Of course, the D700 is more sophisticated in nearly every way, but it's also heavier and more complex to operate. It's also over $2,000 for the body only. I sprang for it. But even so, after considering carefully all the current offerings, my conclusion is that for the money, there is still no better camera than the D90.Update - 15 Feb 2011:I highly recommend Thom Hogan's \"Complete Guide\" series for the Nikon D90 (and for any other Nikons). I bought the one for the D700 and it's just incredibly useful, way more easy to understand and more thorough than the Nikon documentation. It's really essential reading; you get the why, not just the how, and practical advice on settings you should use for different situations. Thom really helped me understand why it's worth shooting in RAW (I now onluy shoot in RAW), and what tradeoffs are worth making and when (ISO vs shutter speed vs aperture). You can only get them off his website so google it. bythom dot com is the address BTW. (I don't know the guy and am not getting a kickback, I swear!!!!)Also, I'm really enjoying having a good quality wide angle zoom, anyone who hasn't obtained one yet for their setup, I think you ought to look into it closely. I find myself using it more and more.", "Date": "November 29, 2008"}, {"Title": "A great camera, but not perfect", "Author": "Traveler", "ReviewID": "R3PL3QNVG6N1W", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "ProsThe same ISO capability of the D300.Intuitive layout that Nikon is famous forFast - focus, frames per second, and card accessFirst DSLR to have video, but . . .ConsVideo has poor audio quality and no AFKit lens is not worth what Nikon says it's worthRecommendation: Casual users who aren't concerned about how tough the kit lens is should buy now.  Semi-pros who want a good lens might want to wait and just get the body (available about a month after the kit release)Before making the leap to the D90 I researched this and other cameras for several weeks.  I actually wanted the more expensive D300 because of the magnesium body and weatherproofing, but ultimately decided that the $600 difference was too big for just that one issue.The D90 has the same sensor (or greatly similar depending on the source) as the D300 which means it shares the same great ISO capabilities.  1600 looks fine and you can definitely get usable small prints from even 3200.  There are some reviewers on other sites claiming that the D90 has better noise reduction than the D300.  Combine that with the the new Nikon VR lenses and you can shoot in low light at ridiculously slow shutter speeds.  I've always hated using a flash and this camera is going to allow me to avoid using it in situations I never dreamed were possible.  I took a shot in a dimly lit room at night and this camera picked up details I couldn't see with my own eyes!The control layout is superb.  The single button choices make complete sense - ISO, image quality, white balance and previous shot are right there on the left side of the LCD.I did not buy this camera for its video function.  However, Nikon did not deliver the goods here.  You can buy a several year old Canon P&S; S2 or S3 that shoots video (VHS/regular quality, not HD) at 30fps with stereo sound AND autofocus.  If they could put that kind of functionality on a $200 camera it should be possible on a $1000 one as well.  It just seems that if you're going to add a function like this it should have been done well or not done at all.  If you're buying this camera because of its video capability then I would urge you to wait until Nikon or another DSLR maker does it right.  Or just buy a separate HD video camera at a fraction of the cost of the D90.I realize a lot of folks like the kit lens, but it is not the same quality as Nikon's other zooms in this price range.  I read that Nikon says this kit lens, the 18-105mm VR, would sell for $400.  Thus the \"$100 savings by buying the kit.\"  I bought the Nikon 70-300mm VR at the same time for about $485 and the build quality is far better with a metal mount and rubber gasket to keep out the elements.  The kit lens has a plastic mount with no rubber gasket and it just feels cheap in comparison.  If you're just looking for a basic everyday lens as an average user this might not matter, but if you're an aspiring amateur/semi-pro this is really not acceptable.Overall this is a great camera and it is, minus the lack of weather proofing (which I can't expect at this price range anyway), exactly what I was looking for.  It does have its flaws, however. Thus the 4 star rating instead of 5.", "Date": "September 18, 2008"}, {"Title": "A big leap in features, but lags a bit in basic imaging", "Author": "Prash Chopra \"Prash\"", "ReviewID":

The feature list is fantastic, plus the fact that it has the sensor of similar quality as the professional grade D300 model, and of course how can you forget the HD video capabilities? The sensor is highly rated for amazing dynamic range and color depth (the blues and greens are dreamingly rich, see my images in the customer images section). Please watch the video for a comparison with Rebel XSi that I owned before this one.[+++++]:- Great sensor, amazing colors out of the camera- Auto D-lighting to restore shadowed regions- Feels great in hand, very comfortable to hold... lighter than a Canon 40d/50d.- The optical viewfinder is bright and big, with great coverage- AF tracking points are easy to spot and switch to- Great 320K dots LCD- Video feature is great.. you can make some really slick short movies after some practice. It is a bit difficult to master both autofocus and zoom and exposure control in video mode, but I guarantee you a huge share of fun with it.. especially with DOF tests:-)[-----]- My copy of the camera came with one big bright hot pixel that was ON even at low ISOs like 200 and at fast shutter speeds. I was just about to learn to ignore it by using the software to map it out, and 2 more developed within a week of normal usage. Not good for a $1K camera right out of the box. I searched online and found many many others with the same issue. Further, you will have to pay at least one way shipping to a Nikon service center to have them mapped out, and yet they say it may develop more with time. I dont understand why a brand new camera has this issue. And its not just my copy, you can search \"Nikon D90 + hot pixels\" and you will find many many recent posts on this topic.- The live view is just a gimmick. It doesnt stand in front of the implementation in a cheaper Canon XSI even. It lacks exposure simulation (the mode which brightens or darkens the LCD view based upon live shot setting changes like ISO/aperture/exposure time etc.). Further, it only goes as high as 6.7X while the XSi and 40D/50D go upto 10X zoom. To add to that, D90 seems to extrapolate the live view image at high zooms from a lower resolution image... showing bad interpolation artifacts like blocks at 6.7X zoom. You have to see it to believe it. Try a Rebel XSi and a D90 live view, and you will know what I mean. Also, there is no exposure scale overlay on the live view image to guide the user whether the shot is under/over exposed. You will have to switch to optical view finder to confirm the shot exposure level. All this renders the live view practically useless for anything but framing a snapshot or a video. In fact it should have been called an LCD view finder and not the live view, which it is not. D90 also only has one auto focus mode in live view which is contrast based, and too slow. Even 40d has a fast phase detect mode. Also, the D90 LCD refreshes only 15 frames per sec while a 40d/50d refreshes at 30 fps - better for sports. If you wear glasses and are hoping this live view will help you take pictures without having to goto the top LCD or the optical view finder, you will be shocked. Having owned an XSi and tried a Canon 50d, I can say with confidence that Nikon really has to improve their live view, or at least stop calling it that. I have let the Nikon customer support know of the interpolation issue at least, and they say it may come as a model update later, probably not an easy firmware update. But their answer was not clear. It took many emails just to explain the problem.- The zoom (+/-) buttons are for the left hand. They may have been like this for most of the Nikons, but coming from Canon, it was a big discomfort to me to first switch the camera weight to the right hand, then move my left hand to use the buttons to the left of the LCD, then switch the hands back. This can be a pain if you have a heavy lens (like 70-300mm VR) and don't have a tripod.- The pixel depth is only 12-bit as compared to 14-bit in a Rebel XSi or a Canon 40d. This is not that obvious, and it is actually surprising that D90 produces great colors for a shorter pixel depth.- The video mode can possibly age your sensor quicker than it should. Because of prolonged exposures (upto 5 minutes in HD mode), the sensor may develop more hot pixels over time than usual. It is also hard to lock exposure while in video.. else there are jerks when the auto-exposure-compensation mode jumps in as the scene brightness changes.In conclusion,- if you can live with a sensor that may come with hot pixels, or may develop more sooner than expected,- if you don't mind using both hands to manage controls while also holding a heavy lens,- if you don't use live view at all and will only use the optical view finder, and- if you have about $1200 to spare (as of Jan 12 2009), and a few hundred more down the line for expensive Nikkor zooms,then this is a great camera for you. You will be more than satisfied with the colors that come flying out of it. Otherwise, allow me to recommend Canon 40d or 50d with pretty much all of the basic imaging done the right way.The live view and the hot pixel issues are a big reason why I gave this camera only 3 stars. Especially so because it is a still camera first.. and if they ship out defective units (with hot pixels) in a brand new box, and ask you to use a software to take 30 minutes just to wait for them to me mapped out, I think they fail to provide the basic purpose of this camera. Plus the live view isnt useful at all except only for shot framing.Edit to add: Here is a website that will let you compare the sensor quality between different models for your information. I am not sure how reliable they are, but they seem genuine.. still I advise you to interpret that data at your own discretion: [...]%7C0/(appareil2)/267%7C0/(appareil3)/262%7C0/(onglet)/0/(brand)/Canon/(brand2)/Canon/(brand3)/Nikon .Edit#2: I have since returned this camera and have ordered a Canon 50d. I want to take good still pictures first, and the video mode and the ineffective live view and the LCD werent helping me too much in doing that. Regardless, it may fit your requirements, in which case please enjoy all the features it comes with, and dont forget to share your first video:-) Here are mine:[...]Edit#3 (1/19/09): After having owned a 50d, I would add one more star to this review, only the system doesnt allow it now. The reason being, I feel D90 handled noise much better... at least better than the 50d. Also, the 50d gave lens mount error right out of the box too... this is with firmware v1.0.3, the latest available.Edit#4: 1/21/09. I confirmed that D90 had better noise performance in day-to-day use as compared to Canon 50d. Again, no lab tests, no controlled environment.. but just regular in-house pictures.. and I can see more chroma-noise with Canon 50d pictures. Also, no matter what I tried with the Canon pictures style editor, it was near to impossible to get the 'punchy' colors that nikon produces. In all fairness, Canon's picture style editor is a great idea, and it does help a lot too (see my blog here: [...] ). But the limitations are with how we can only select and change 100 discrete/individual colors, and there is no easy way to just plain rotate the color cone for all the possible colors. I decided to return the Canon 50d for these reasons.. plus the fact that it started giving me lens mount errors right out of the box. Come what may, I have re-ordered the D90 kit (I know.. but at least I tried both and found out what I like). I know I will miss the tack sharp live view and the hot-pixel-less sensor from Canon, but I have come to realise that what counts is the ultimate aesthetics of picture-taking, and Nikon D90 gave me that. I caught myself frequently comparing D90's output pictures with the 50d's. And no matter what I did, I always spent more time staring at and panning and zooming in the Nikon results. In a way, they 'called' me.I plan to deal with the hot pixels with Adobe Lightroom which automagically maps them out from raw images. Or I will write scripts to map them in batches from both RAW and JPEGs in Capture NX2 (yes.. I found out that Capture NX2 allows you to remap hot pixels even in JPEGS.. so you dont necessarily have to shoot RAWs to avoid the hot pixels. as is the common misconception!).So if you have read this review so far, please know this: I chose aesthetic pleasure over technical (or specification) superiority.. a personal choice. And if I could change the star rating of this camera, I would now make it 4-1/2. The half points will still be gone for hot-pixels and inferior live view with no exposure simulation.There. I lived through two great cameras, and embraced one. Its your turn now. Good luck.. and whichever one you choose, make sure you like the end result.. and not just the camera's specifications or mega pixel count:-)", "Date": "January 12, 2009"}, {"Title": "Review Written for Beginner Photographers", "Author": "jpullos", "ReviewID": "R1H8RQUHXWCFTB", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I am a photography teacher in NYC and online. (See my Amazon profile for my website.) I teach beginner and intermediate photography students every week. I've also been a professional photographer for the last five years with images published in The New York Times, GQ, New York Magazine, Women's Wear Daily, The New York Observer, The Village Voice and Time Out New York.(This review is for beginner photographers.)If you're a beginner, you're most likely asking yourself: Nikon or Canon? Really, I feel confident in saying that you can't go wrong with either. I've used both brand's cameras extensively and find that they both offer amazing image quality with well-built, solid cameras that, if taken care of, will last decades. There are two differences between the cameras, though, that can be taken into consideration.The user-interface: If cameras were computers, Nikons would be PCs and Canons would be MACs. PCs are built for people not afraid of technology whereas Macs are built for people who want things super-easy. Nikons excel at customization options which means you'll see so many more options with the Advanced features of a Nikon than you will with a Canon. Canons, on the other hand, excel at ease-of-use for beginners. Canons offer less advanced options and can be easier to learn on. This can be frustrating down the line, though, once you've learned a lot about photography. At that point you may want all of the options that Nikon offers and be frustrated with your Canon. If you're someone who really likes to delve deep into your hobbies or if you're intent on becoming a professional photographer, I'd say a Nikon would be your best bet. If you're someone who wants to learn the basics of photography and only imagine yourself being a hobbyist, Canon would be a better option for you.Where Nikon excels: Flash photography. I often find myself in situations where I'm shooting event photography (weddings, movie premiers, benefits and galas) where I need to use a lot of flash. For this kind of photography, I'll always prefer to be shooting with a Nikon. Nikon's flash metering (how the camera magically decides how much light to fire out of the flash) is much more consistent than Canon's. You can take a Canon and shoot the same scene three times in a row with flash and all three images will be at different brightness levels. You can do the same thing with a Nikon and all three images will be wonderfully the same. If you're somebody who plans on shooting a lot with flash (indoor photography, event photography, etc.) you'll want to consider going with Nikon.Where Canon excels: Richness of colors. I've been in numerous situations where I've been on the red carpet taking the exact same picture as the photographer next to me. I'll have a Canon and the person next to me will have a Nikon. This has provided quite a few opportunities to compare the images side-by-side. What I've found is that the colors on the Canon's images look richer and make the image pop more. If I'm doing fine art photography (anything I'd like to someday hang in a gallery), I'll always want to be shooting with a Canon for this reason.If you're set on Nikon, there are three cameras you should be considering and it all comes down to what your budget is:D7000 $1,400 without lensD5100 $750 without lensD3100 $600 only available with lens(current prices as of 2/19/11)Since you're on the D90 Amazon page, though, I'm going to guess that you're considering the D90 which Amazon is currently selling for $900 (without lens). If you're considering buying the D90 because you didn't realize that Nikon has replaced the D90 with two new camera models (the D5100 and D7000), then you may want to go straight for one of those two models, depending on your budget. If you were already aware that Nikon has newer models and are still considering the D90 then here's how the D90 stacks up to the D5100 and the D7000. (The D90 is such a great camera that, even though Nikon has newer, replacement models, they still sell the D90!)D90 vs. D7000:Where the D7000 excels:-Higher resolution: The D7000 is a 16 MegaPixel camera whereas the D90 is only a 12 MegaPixel camera. This effects how big you can print your images and have them remain high quality prints. 16 MegaPixels will print as big as 24 inches by 16 inches whereas 12 MegaPixels will print as big as 21 inches by 14 inches. A higher resolution also means you can crop an image and have the remaining image still remain high quality.-Longer battery life. The D7000's battery will last 20% longer than the D90's.-Two memory card slots. This is really a cool feature. The D7000 has two memory card slots which means you'll be less likely to find yourself standing in front of a gorgeous scene with no more memory left.-More focus points. When using auto-focus, the D7000 will have an easier time focusing on what you want it to focus on.-Faster continuous shooting. If you're often shooting sports or any fast moving subject, continuous shooting allows you to capture multiple images in a single second. The D90 shoots at 4.5 frames per second whereas the D7000 shoots at six frames per second.-Higher ISO options. The D7000 offers two more stops of ISO than the D90 does. If you don't know what ISO means (or what a stop is) just know that this allows you to more easily shoot images in low-light situations.-Weather sealed. This means you can shoot with the D7000 in the rain.-Faster shutter speed. The fastest shutter speed on the D90 is 1/4000th of a second; on the D7000: 1/8000th of a second. To be honest, I can't think of any practical reason why this would benefit you unless you're planning on shooting some really bright scenes like directly into the sun.-Higher quality video and continuous focus while you're shooting video (for all your video buffs out there)-An external mic jack. (If you're planning on shooting video with an external mic, you'll want the D7000 over the D90.)Where the D90 excels:-It's a more affordable camera. By saving money on the D90, you'll have more money in your budget for an awesome lens or two!D90 vs. D5100:Where the D5100 excels:-The D5100 is more affordable. More money for lens(es)!-Higher resolution: The D5100 is a 16 MegaPixel camera whereas the D90 is only a 12 MegaPixel camera. This effects how big you can print your images and have them remain high quality prints. 16 MegaPixels will print as big as 24 inches by 16 inches whereas 12 MegaPixels will print as big as 21 inches by 14 inches. A higher resolution also means you can crop an image and have the remaining image still remain high quality.-Smaller and lighter: The D5100 is 10% smaller and 20% lighter than the D90. This is something to consider if you plan on carrying your camera around with you a lot.-A flip out screen (handy if you want to put your camera anywhere but at your eye level and be able to see what your camera is about to capture before you shoot it.)-Higher ISO options. The D5100 offers two more stops of ISO than the D90 does. If you don't know what ISO means (or what a stop is) just know that this allows you to more easily shoot images in low-light situations.-Higher quality video and continuous focus while you're shooting video (for all your video buffs out there)-An external mic jack. (If you're planning on shooting video with an external mic, you'll want the D5100 over the D90.)-HDR feature. This is only applicable if HDR is of interest to you. If you don't know what HDR is, I wouldn't worry about it, especially since there are tons of great HDR software programs you can buy, for very little money, if you want to explore it later.Where the D90 excels:-Longer battery life. The D90's battery will last 30% longer than the D5100's.To sum this all up, if you can afford the D7000 body, get the D7000 body. If you can't afford the D7000 body, the D5100 is the way to go since it costs less than the D90 and comes with many advantages. (If you can't afford the D5100, get the D3100. You'll see my review of that camera on the D3100 Amazon page.)If I can clarify any of this, please email me!-JP Pullos, photography teacher, NYC and online (see my Amazon profile for my website)", "Date": "October 18, 2011"}, {"Title": "D90 a Big Step Up From the D40", "Author": "Shutterbug", "ReviewID": "R35VF9W4T3A8MH", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I just upgraded to the D90 from the D40 because I was tired of futzing with the white balance of the D40, and I wanted more low-light sensitivity (better ISO), as well as the flexibility of using faster lenses, many of which are not AF-S.I have been very impressed with the D90.  I'm comparing it to the D40. It takes significantly better pictures because of its larger dynamic range and better colors (ADR) and better white balance. The things that I think are important are ranked from most to least important.1. Active D-lighting (ADR).  This has gotten me photos with large dynamic ranges of light (highly shaded subjects with a bright background) that I would have otherwise botched.  Also, we rent a house where they did a quick paint job in white, but there are splotches of beige and light green underneath.  We've never successfully taken photos of this with the D40 or our point-and-clicks.  The D90 pulls these out (without flash) to the point where it's easier to see them in the photo than by eye, and it nails the colors!  I also suspect that the ADR is helping tame the noise at high ISO levels (see #3 below).2. White Balance.  The white balance is a big improvement over the D40, which botched AWB lots of times.  If you look closely, it's not perfect, but close enough for all but the perfectionists, and the beauty is it works in Auto.  That means that you can focus on taking pictures and not on fiddling with your settings so much.  There's also a lot of flexibility to set your AWB defaults with a lot of precision.3. Low light photography.  I take a lot of shots indoors without flash.  Until very recently, there weren't any f/1.4 prime lenses that were AF-S (needed on D40).  The D90 helps in 2 ways: a) takes AF-D lenses and b) has better high ISO performance.  I did controlled tests using my 55-200mm VR lens at 55mm (f/4) and looked at ISO sharpness and color on the D40 and D90.  I did it in manual mode, following the exact procedure of Ken Rockwell (tripod, VR off, remote trigger).  I find that the D90 is between 1 and 2 stops better ISO than the D40. D90/ISO 6400 is too dirty, but D90/3200 is pretty usable.  With the D40 at ISO 800, the sharpness is slightly better than the D90 at 3200 (but worse than D90/1600), but there's a lot more out-of-control, day-old pizza look in dark sections with the D40 at 800 than the D90 at 3200 (I'm guessing that ADR is helping here).  The D90's color starts to fade at little at ISO 1600, and drops more at 3200, then quite a bit at 6400.4. The 11-point AF has helped get things in focus compared with the D40's 3 spots. AF also feels faster. Autofocusing is a big improvement.5. I also really like that it's quicker changing ISO, WB and QUAL because of dedicated buttons.  I've also set AF as my top choice under My Menu, making it 1 button away as well (hit the Fn button).  This was another Rockwell suggestion.6. The screen is amazing, as others have said.  Also, you can navigate a zoomed image on the screen really fast.7. I'm also looking forward to using my SB600 flash remotely in commander mode (you can't do that on the D40).8. On the down-side, I've just discovered that some old Nikon manual-focus lenses from the 1960s will not mount on the D90, but they will on the D40.  I don't think this should affect too many people.Another observation: I'm not that familiar with the D300 and D700, but the D90 feels pretty solid compared to the D40.  I thought that weight would help stabilize hand-held shots, but I also find that it's shutter is stronger than the D40, and that vibration tends to cancel out its heavier weight in terms of holding the camera still.For someone who doesn't like to adjust the manual settings very much, the main benefits of the D90 over the D40 are the ADR and WB.  These upgrades will probably appear in the D40 replacement in ~6 months.  I might wait for that.  For others who use their manual settings regularly, this is quite a camera.", "Date": "December 1, 2008"}, {"Title": "Excellent Camera - Good Lens", "Author": "Brian Murphy", "ReviewID": "RJHOET5JQP42W", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "~The first part of this review is on the body only. The lens review will be at the bottom.~For those of you trying to decide between the D80 and D90, I share your dilemma. I spent a lot of time deliberating between the two before making my decision. The D80 offers an amazing realm of features for the money, but the D90 has features you'll wish you had. The D90 offers a 3\" LCD to the D80's 2.5\", an active anti-dust cleaning system for the sensor, LiveView which is a real boon in tricky angle situations but due to it's slow autofocus speed, use the viewfinder for most other situations, and of course 12.3MP to the D80's 10.2MP. The ISO range is also expanded from 200-3200, to the D80's 100-1600 with better signal-to-noise ratio. The D90 also offers a Lo-1 and Hi-1 expanded ISO of 100 and 6400 respectively. The D90 has excellent image editing and shooting mode options. The Color settings are Standard, Neutral and Vivid, all with adjustable parameters. It also offers a Monochrome setting also with adjustable settings. (NOTE: Tweak the contrast in-camera on Monochrome, and you can (almost) achieve the look of B&W; film). The shooting mode dial offers Manual, Aperture Priority, Shutter Priority, and Program Auto, along with some specialized modes. They all offer excellent options for exposure, but if you're used to a manual 35mm camera, go with full Manual mode. The only automatic functions I use are Autofocus and Auto White Balance, and I get better results adjusting exposure myself. Bottom Line: Those experienced with SLR's and willing to spend a little extra should definitely go with this camera. The return on the investment will be worth the cash.LENS REVIEWThe AF-S NIKKOR 18-105mm 3.5-5.6G VR ED wide-angle zoom lens included with the D90 kit is a good lens. Despite it's plastic mount and relatively small maximum aperture, it's a good first lens. However, I've had the camera for only two days and have already probed the limits of the lens in low light. The VR function is it's saving grace. I was able to get a handheld shot indoors at night in relatively low lighting with a 1/50 shutter speed at f/3.5 at about ISO 400, although very slightly underexposed. In normal daylight situations out in the world, this lens performed very well. The AF is smooth and quiet, with very little hiccups. The depth of field, despite the max. aperture of 3.5, is very nice, as is the bokeh. As a kit lens, it's a step above the competition. However, when you decide to upgrade the lens I'd go with two: The 18-200mm VR Wide Angle Zoom as your walkaround lens and the AF 50mm Nikkor 1.4D for low light indoor/night portraits.~This is an addition to the review above~I'd recommend shooting color shots on the Standard or Neutral settings. The Vivid setting can make colors look too artificial and in some cases bleed together. You'll be better off playing with color corrections in Photoshop to achieve higher saturation and contrast.", "Date": "November 10, 2008"}, {"Title": "Which camera do I choose????", "Author": "Trevor Jones", "ReviewID": "RUGOQSNLN4AUM", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I've been using a point and shoot camera for about 5 years now - I'm by no means a photographer, just an average dad trying to take some pictures. My son recently turned one and I've been finding it more and more difficult to capture those precious moments. I press the button on my point and shoot....delay...missed the shot. Also whenever I take photos indoor I've found they are always blurry or noisy, just not very good. So I elected to get a Digital SLR camera - wow they are expensive! I did very extensive research before making the most important decision. Which one do I get??? I decided to narrow my search to Canon and Nikon, the two top brands. I was considering the Canon Xsi, Canon 40D, and Nikon D90.  I quickly decided the Xsi was not for me. On paper it looks great. It has a ton of great reviews and I'm sure it takes amazing pictures. The price was the cheapest of all the cameras I was considering. After visiting Best Buy and actually trying the cameras out the xsi felt like a toy compared to its big brother the 40D. Also the kit lens was very disappointing as far as zoom capabilities.  I did like the 40D a lot. The body seems really solid and well build (even more so than the D90). I loved the 6fps rapid shooting (although I can't imagine I would every really need to shot quite that fast). The kit lens seems like a huge improvement over the wimpy one on the xsi. The camera seemed good to me but after picturing my wife using it, it seemed just a tad to \"big and heavy\". Some people might disagree.  The D90 had a few features that really appealed to me. One of the main things I really liked about the D90 was the beautiful 3\" VGA screen for reviewing. This screen was a big reason why I went with this camera over the Canon models. It's the same size but has 4 times the resolution. Why would you care about this? It's just really nice when you take a shoot you can immediately tell if you got it or not. With the canons I found you had to either zoom in or download to the computer before you could really tell if the photo came out well. The D90 also just had a lot of other tricks up its sleeve that I thought were nice. There is a HDMI output to hook this baby up to your fancy HDTV. The camera also has built in software that creates an animated slideshow of your pictures for viewing on the TV. Again, doesn't really effect image quality but it's a cool feature. There's also some neat post processing you can do right on the camera including red eye removal, black and white filter, or tilt the picture if you accidentally took it at a slight angle. Of course there is the movie mode also (lack of auto focus makes this feature a little disappointing actually). One final selling point for the D90 over the 40D was the kit lens. For me the kit lens is very important because I don't really plan on purchasing a bunch of different lenses and swapping them out all the time. I just want a decent \"all purpose\" lens. The 40D's 28-135mm kit lens just felt a little to \"zoomed-in\" for me. After playing with it I wanted to be able to zoom out more but was unable to. The D90's 18-105 feels like a pretty good range for me (keep in mind that these cameras have a 1.5 multiplier built in).  The best advice I can give is to go try the cameras out before you order one. Just go with the one you feel most comfortable with, trust your gut. I've been very happy with my D90 but I'm sure all of the cameras I was considering would have been a huge step up from a point and shot.UPDATE 12/3/12Still really happy with this camera.

Overall I'm extremely satisfied with the purchase. As others have mentioned, it's not perfect, but it's probably the best available right now in this price range.This is my first dSLR and I was impressed with how quickly I was able to jump in and start using it. You can get excellent images right out of the box using the Auto or scene modes. I took it to the USC football game last weekend and was able to get great shots using in Action mode. The images were very sharp, noise free, and because of the 12.3MP resolution, I was able to crop them while still having plenty to work with.The movie mode is very cool, but the limitations (no autofocus, 5 minute limit for HD) are a bit annoying. It's definitely not a replacement for an HD camcorder, but it's good enough for general purpose.The lens is nice because it's light and compact, but the 18-200mm lens would be a lot more useful. I'll probably end up either buying that or the 70-300mm lens so I can get close-up shots.I'd highly recommend this camera to anyone looking for a dSLR in this price range. Even if it's your first dSLR, you'll be able to get great shots with it out of the box, and as many users have pointed out, image quality is nearly on par with the more expensive D300.

This review is for this body / lens combo.

Basically it has to do with the lens mounting contacts being sticky and not fitting into the body right. Well there are a lot of great reviews as well so I figured the chances of getting a camera and lens with this problem were low. I also figured that if it happened it would happen every now and then, and not be a big deal.Well I was wrong. On a 2 hour photo shoot yesterday it happened more than 20 times. It would happen in the middle of shooting, the camera would just refuse to take pictures. Sometimes it would fix itself when I would adjust the lens, other times I would have to turn the camera off and on and off and on. Sometimes it would error and wouldn't even turn off without removing the battery completely.This isn't just a minor error either. The camera won't let you take pictures when the f-- error is showing.Playing around with the camera for a few hours today yields even worse results. Almost every single time the camera is turned on it is in a state of aperture error. Formatting the memory card, like some sources tell you to do, doesn't help.

The results are sometimes less than satisfactory. When using flash, the subject is well lit but the background would be dim. (you could solve this placing multiple flashes in the GYM like the professionals) when not using flash, you get hand shakes and motion blur. I shot my daughter's TKD blackbelt test yesterday, the D90 blew me away. Here is what it does, on Sport mode with Flash, it selected ISO 1100, F4 and 1/60. subject is well lit, the back kick is frozen to show the form, the foreground and background of the GYM were well lit. The white balance is perfect. I could not have done a matter job myself in manual mode! At the same sport mode, D50 chose ISO 500, F5.6 and 1/60.

I have read the manual a couple of times and still do not understand all the linked menu setting changes (you change something on one submenu and you might cancel out something else that you didn't want to)  This could also be a positive, but I am not sure I would recommend this camera to a first time DSLR owner.

I take mostly pictures of people at events and many of my baby son without flash in low light situations.I had been using a Nikon D40x for 1 year and very early reached my limitation with that camera. The Nikon D40x has very nice image quality, but the camera's interface is not suited for a more serious shooter who wants quick single button or dial access to such shooting parameters such as white balance, shooting mode, metering mode, etc. I also felt very limited by the D40x not having an in-body focus motor that would allow me to use non AF-I/AF-S lenses (which are lenses without the focus motor built-in).The Nikon D40x limitations were severe enough that I was about to consider purchasing a Canon 40D until the Nikon D90 appeared just in time.PROS:1. Fantastic set of separate buttons on the camera to control parameters like ISO, white balance, metering, autofocus, image quality, shooting mode, etc.2. Two command dials3. High resolution 920K pixel LCD screen (like the one on the Nikon D300)4. 12.3 megapixel CMOS sensor5. Low noise high ISO capability (for low light shooting) I can shoot ISO 1600 with good image quality with this camera, while on my D40x I could only shoot with ISO 400 and obtain acceptable IQ.  I will even use ISO 3200 frequently with very usable results!6. Separate top-viewing LCD screen in addition to the rear high res screen, to show shooting parameters constantly7. In-body focus motor which allows the use of Nikon's non AF-I/S lenses, including wonderful and CHEAP prime lenses such as the Nikkor 50mm 1.8 (~$100 lens!)8. Continuous shooting of 4.5 frames per second9. Small size, although larger than the D40/D40x/D60, it is still substantially smaller in the hand than the D300/D310. 720p 24fps MPEG video shooting capability with incredible ability to use depth of field that I cannot achieve with my Sony High-Def camcorder.11.

Terrific build quality17. Top notch camera ergonomics (but this will be a very personal opinion that differs for each shooter)CONS:1. \"Rolling shutter\" phenomenon while recording video: The D90 CMOS sensor has the same problem that other CMOS video recorders have when recording video. If you move the camera, especially horizontally, you get a \"jelly\" or \"rubberbanding\" effect where the image wobbles significantly. It is nice to have the video features, which looks very sharp at 720p, but it is NOT a substitute for a video camera. If you use a tripod, and do not do quick zooms/pans, the video quality is excellent. Without a tripod, however, you may get nauseous watching a wobbly video. The sound is also in monoaural.2. 1/200 flash synch: Not a problem for me, but it might be for you.3. No weather sealing: This is found on the Nikon D300/D3 and even on similarly priced models from other camera companies4. The buffer will fill up after about 8 continuous RAW + JPG (FINE) shots.  This number differs depending on the shooting parameters that you will choose.  If you shoot primarily JPG, the buffer seems to allow a very large number of continuous shots, but I have not quantified this for JPG only.TIPS:1. Get the FREE Nikon ViewNX software from Nikon's site as your 1st step in your workflow. This will let you examine your RAW images that you can process for either Nikon CaptureNX2 to do further RAW processing or just export to JPG or TIFF for a JPG/TIFF editor such as PhotoShop.2. Recommend buying the Nikon CaptureNX2. It is a RAW converter (if you shoot in RAW) that will read the camera settings properly for export to JPG or TIFF. Capture NX2, however, is not as slick as the Adobe products and Capture NX2 requires a fairly powerful computer, otherwise it can run pretty slowly on a PC > 3 years old.3. If you use JPEGs out-of-camera, consider increasing the sharpness above the default 3 or 4.  Nikon uses a very conservative sharpening default setting.  Nikon has also decided to change the default JPEG images to match the higher end D3/D700/D300 cameras which produce more neutral images. Consequently, the D90 images that are less punchy than the D40/D40x/D60/D80, so you may also want to turn up the in-camera saturation and contrast.The Nikon D90 has all of the interface features that serious and even professional photographers need with wonderful image quality.", "Date": "September 20, 2008"}, {"Title": "Hands on review", "Author": "Hiram Grant \"just call me Sam\"", "ReviewID": "R28JMSO2L3CFOX", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I start by stating that we are still waiting for those that can do the most critical of reviews concerning image quality (IQ), etc.  Therefore, this will be a general reference of the features based on experience, the competition, and my own 2 cents.For those of you familiar with the D80, this camera is very similar.  The 3\" LCD is the first obvious difference.  Besides being larger, it's much sharper, allowing more critical examination of photos, and, combined with live-view, a much greater ability to use for critical focusing.  The only, very slight drawback, is the larger size seems to have required the toggle on the back to be slightly redesigned, and I feel it is a bit more uncomfortable (on my thumb joint) to toggle with the camera raised to my eye than on most Nikons.A closer look of the externals show a bit of difference in the plugs.  The place for a remote control cord now is also an input for an optional GPS device.  Cool, but Nikon hasn't released pricing for this piece yet, nor do we really know how well it will work, nor any of its complete functions.  The camera now can output HD, which is a big boost if that feature is used.Going into the inside mechanics to things we can't see, the frames per second (fps) has been increased from 3 on the D80 to 4.5 on this camera.  That's a tremendous advantage to budget oriented sports photographers.  Going hand-in-hand with that feature is that the shutter has been upgraded to a 100,000 cycles.  We like to think that shooting extra frames are \"free\", but shooting at high speeds puts a big burden on the camera's durability.  We like to joke about 100,000 being a lot, but at 4.5 fps, that's about 6.25 hours until you camera's toast!Also inside inside is a cleaning system to keep dirt and dusk off the imaging surface.OK, so now let's go to the image quality.  From the samples I've both shot and seen, they look good.  But we really need to wait for critical reviews to be absolutely certain.  From the D80, we've upgraded from 10 to 12 megapixels, which is nice, but the better part is we've gone to a CMOS sensor.  This should have two results: 1) lower power consumption; and, 2) better low-light performance.  The former is a certainty, CMOS sensors are way more power efficient than CCDs.  The latter is based on experience.  CMOS sensors tend to have nicer performance in low light shooting when we have to crank up the artificial \"film\" speeds to things like 1600 ISO.  However, adding more pixels seem to make the situation worse.  Based on previous experiences, and with the advances made in technology, the D90 should produce both sharper images and better low-light noise control than the D80.From just \"looking\" at the images I've shot, they look great in all kinds of conditions, although nothing I've shot would be considered \"demanding\".  Sharpness is great, colors look real.From a spec point, the only thing that might be a bit disappointing is that the images are 12-bit and not 14-bit (like the D300).  For those of you who shoot only JPEG (.jpg) images, that's no concern.  For those who shoot RAW (.nef on Nikons), then 14-bit means that more data is recorded in the process of turning the image (taken by an analog sensor) into a digital file (called A/D conversion).  If we go back to work with these files, there is more data available.  This has some, limited, practical practice today.  The biggest difference will be somewhere down the line when computer monitors allow more info to be displayed, and when printers allow more to be printed, etc.  Twenty years from now you'll probably be able to make much better prints from today's images.Now let's touch on video.  I think it's a great thing that video is included, because, at worst, you don't have to use it!  What little I've done with the camera looks good (but I've only played it on the LCD), and the sound playback, although mono, was MUCH better than I expected.  But let's not try to compare this with the best camcorders on the market.  First, the HD clips are limited to 5 minutes.  That simply won't work for many events, and even though you don't see many continuous 5 minute clips in \"serious\" productions, most of what you see are edited down from longer clips.  The 24fps is a trendy thing today on BluRay players, because that's what feature length movies are shot in traditionally.  However, 30fps is more typical video, which helps stops action better.  Autofocusing is not available with video, which might be a hindrance for some people.My biggest disappointment was that Nikon didn't include \"voice memo\" capability, available on all Coolpix cameras.  Since you have a microphone for the video, this feature allows you to attach voice memos of about 20 seconds to a photograph.  This is a great way to connect a name to a face or place.  Boo, Nikon, for not including this simple feature!OK, so how does it compare to the competition?  We first must look at their biggest competitor, Canon.  Price wise, the D90 is between the Rebel XSi and the soon to be released 50D.  For budget minded photos, the XSi (which sells for about $300 less body to body), offers, again, a 12 megapixel CMOS sensor, which is also 14-bit.  You'll give up the video completely, and drop to 3.5fps.  The 50D is 15 megapixel (14-bit), 6.3fps, built into a metal and more weatherproof body.  Once again, you'll give up the video, and $400.  I do, however, think the built quality difference here might be a critical difference if buying this to make money.Sony has some nice cameras, too.  The Alpha 350 is $200 less, and is a 14 megapixel CCD sensor.  It'll probably be a great fit for outdoor photographers, but will not be as good a choice for low light use.  The heavier built Alpha 700 (12 megapixel CMOS) can be purchased for about $200 more than the D90.The D90 should do just great.

I look at this as a good thing because I was starting to get a little bored with my D40 and had reached its limits.

That wasn't the case with my old D40.  I have been to many professional shoots and shot with pros who use anything from a D200, D300, or D3 (much more expensive and bigger cameras) and it more than keeps up with them and my pictures are just as good if not better than theirs.  My favorite lens is the 85mm f/1.8 prime lens which I could not have used (with autofocus) had I still had a D40, D40x, D60, D3000, or D5000.  This alone should push you to the D90 if you're on the fence. There is no comparison between the D90 and those other cameras.If you're an advanced amateur or pro debating between this and the D300, there ARE a few annoying things about the D90 so full disclosure:The camera doesn't have a sync port so if you shoot with studio lights, you'd have to buy an AS-15 sync cord adapter for $20.  I still wish it had one so I could use the sync cord AND a radio trigger for weird lighting setups.Also the flash sync speed is only 1/200 as compared to the 1/250 of the D300.  Again, this matters mostly if you use a lot of flash or studio lights and want to get rid of the most ambient light as you can.The native ISO speed on the camera is 200 instead of 100.  This isn't an issue most of the time, but if you're out in bright light, it limits how wide your lens can open and also requires more power out of your fill flash.  I've only found this limitation once while shooting in really bright beach shoots since in a studio setting, ISO 200 is very clean and 100 isn't really needed.*edit*It is now Feb 14, 2009 and I still love my D90.  I have been to many shoots, seen many people with bigger cameras but my D90 still hangs tough with the best of them.  I've also noticed many people who bought a D5000 or a D3000 to save a little money and now they want to buy a 50mm lens and see that because their camera doesn't have an AF motor, their savings went out the window when they were forced to buy newer AF-S lens.  I'm glad I don't have that problem with the D90.  I also don't know how I lived without flash commander mode.*edit again*June of 2010 and the D90 is still going solid and we've had many adventures, family events, model shoots and no buyer's remorse :)", "Date": "November 23, 2008"}, {"Title": "Don't discount the lens mount error", "Author": "Amazon Enthusiast", "ReviewID": "R3NI8QM9FPIGP7", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "The D90 was my first step into DSLR and I chose Nikon because of 20+ years of good past experience with a rock-solid (and very basic!) N2000 and later the digital Coolpix 950. I bought my D90 in June 2009 and for several thousand images it fell in the category \"you shouldn't ever feel this close to an inanimate object\".  I like the way it feels in my hand and its weight isn't a problem for me, although I've seen a few negative comments about that. I'm happy with the bright display. The batteries have lasted well. The controls are where they should be for a Nikon. It was solid: you can easily freeze the hummingbird in the air and the water droplets falling from a dolphin at its apex.  It had the kind of responsiveness that you'll recall if you've worked with plain old SLRs (and minus the \"lag\" of the older non-SLR Coolpix!).It'd be safe to say I love almost everything about the camera...*except* that I've recently run into the F-- lens mount error. I'd read Amazon reviews before buying the camera, but blew off what people had writtenYou can read more about the problem (and 18-135 lens kit) here:[...]and in the results of a Google search of \"d90 lens error\" or similar.I've removed the lens, cleaned the contacts, etc. but quite often now I'll be squeezing a shot and nothing...sometimes jiggling the lens or remounting fixes the problem. Even slight pressure on the side of the zoom can correct the problem.All I can really say about the problem is that if you don't have it, you'll probably love the D90. If you *do* have it, it's really a deal breaker. In any situation with a moving/changing subject, you almost never have a second chance once you've nudged the lens a bit and tried to clear it. And having that confidence in your equipment that it will work reliably when you need it is unspeakably important.Without the lens mount/electrical contact error, I'd give the camera the highest rating. As is, I now have to figure out what the Nikon terms are on servicing the camera, determine where to send it, etc. All I really want now is to have this camera back working correctly because I think it's a beautiful piece of technology when working.", "Date": "November 8, 2009"}, {"Title": "The ultimate semi-pro or prosumer camera!", "Author": "C.

I paired this D90 with the Nikon 18-200 mm lens and the Santechi LCD battery grip, as well as a Delkin silicone body skin and a B+W UV multi-coated filter as well as a Nikon SB-600 speedlight flash.  Every part of the camera and lens is now fully protected. ( A slight bit of trimming on the Delkin skin was necessary, along the bottom of the skin, so I could put the LCD battery grip on.  Delkin states you can't put a battery grip on with their skin. But if you trim a bit of the skin then it fits perfectly!  So no worries there. Get the Delkin skin. It is well worth it!)  As a complete unit, it functions beautifully.  Speaking about just the camera here, it is ridiculously easy to use, very intuitive, a well thought out design, well balanced, with enough heft, yet light enough for all that it offers.  The pictures rendered, and the bright, 3\" LCD screen on the back of the camera makes it wonderful to use.  The menus are thoughtfully laid out.  As for the video mode, it works just fine with the Nikon 18-200 mm lens.  Best used in video mode for fixed distance videoing. I vidoed my future son-in-law fishing waist deep in a local river.  The video came out excellent.  Remember, this is a camera first.  Not a video cam.  But having the video option is nice, as you have everything within one camera body.  This camera is certainly worthy as a semi-pro entry; maybe even as a back-up camera to a Nikon D3 or D3X for a professional photographer.  I think the D40 or the newer D5000 would be a better choice for light users who want a few more features than a simple point-and-shoot camera, but who have no intention of really delving into photography and learning all the terminology and techniques involved in lighting, exposure compensation, picture composition, etc.  But, if you are serious about photography and want room to grow, or you are a photo enthusiast, semi-pro  or pro, you would be hard pressed to find a camera with a better price/functionality point.  I purchased my D90 through Amazon via J&R; Music, as they had the best price and had the D90 in stock. I received the camera a day after the order was placed.  In less than 2 weeks I had taken nearly 1700 shots.  I have taken early dawn, early twilight, late night, portrait, nature, time exposures, double exposures, and sports photos in that time.  It is nearly impossible to take a bad picture with this camera. It is easy and a pleasure to set up.  Once you take the necessary time to learn the camera and all that it can do, you will understand what a joy it is to own this camera.  I highly recommend visiting the KenRockwell.com site to become well-educated on photography in general as well as getting a crash course with a simple, no-nonsense approach regarding the workings of the D90 -- well beyond all the sometimes useless and verbose language the Nikon manual for the D90 employs.Bottom Line:  The Nikon D90 is nearly impossible to beat right now for the price/function point.  TIP:  Invest in high quality lens/lenses as it/they will do more for you than the camera, as far as giving you quality pictures. Great pictures are more about proper lighting and exposure than the camera or the lens. Those things merely make it easier for getting that great shot.  The photographer is responsible for the composition of the shot.

So here are some helpful points that I had a hard time ferreting out when doing my research before pulling the trigger on this purchase, given that I was upgrading from a D60 and that I am, like many who are reading reviews on this product, not a professional:1. I owned the D40, then the D60. So this is my third Nikon. I had trouble deciphering how my lenses, purchased for the D40/D60, would behave when used in this new model. The answer is that the D90 handles all of them perfectly. This includes lenses that have the HSM built in (the Hyper Sonic Motor is packaged in the lens, because the D40/D60 range doesn't have a built in auto-focus motor) as well as those with no internal motor. The D90 has an internal focus motor, so all lenses built for Nikon cameras will auto-focus, including the Nikon 50mm f1.8 lens that I had to manually focus in the D60.2. The D90 is heavier, but certainly not uncomfortable to hold or carry. Weight will not be a discouraging factor in purchasing this camera.3. The D90 takes different batteries, so any spares you have for the earlier models will not work on it. Battery life is truly outstanding. I am not even going to buy a spare battery.4. The user interface is completely different from the D40/D60. I found it intuitive however. The functionality is just superb, much easier and more flexible. This is a pro level camera with the ease of use of a high end amateur camera.5. Live view is a great enhancement. Really.Overall, there is nothing I can say negative about the D90. It's everything I was hoping it would be, and it's so worth the money to upgrade. I'm selling the D60 for half what I paid - and doing it gladly - because the D90 is worth more than it's being sold for. I absolutely highly recommend it.I also thought I would offer some lens advice, because I had trouble finding a reviewer that just cut to the chase and said \"look, just do this.\" So, look, just do this: I do NOT recommend the kit lenses that you can obtain bundled with the D90. Get the body only (Nikon D90 DX 12.3MP Digital SLR Camera (Body Only)), and buy yourself that Nikon 50mm f1.8 (Nikon 50mm f/1.8D AF Nikkor Lens for Nikon Digital SLR Cameras). It's a no-brainer at the price point, and the images I have already achieved have been just excellent. For the rest of your lenses, I highly recommend Sigma. I own the 18-200 (Sigma 18-200mm f/3.5-6.3 DC Lens for Nikon Digital SLR Cameras), the 10-20 (Sigma 10-20mm f/4-5.6 EX DC HSM Lens for Nikon Digital SLR Cameras), and the 150-500 (Sigma 150-500mm f/5-6.3 AF APO DG OS HSM Telephoto Zoom Lens for Nikon Digital SLR Cameras). I cannot say enough positive things about the quality of the lenses or the images. Pack the 50mm and the 18-200 superlens for normal occasions. If you can stand the extra weight, you absolutely cannot go wrong with the 10-20 for landscapes, it just pulls in everything and the quality is shocking. The 150-500 is enormous, you are not going to want to carry that thing around, but when you need it, you really need it. I captured images of my son playing in a soccer game that blew me away; could not have gotten the shots without the big lens. Get the lenses in the order I have specified if you cannot afford them all.I have just learned all this over the past 2 years. I am no expert but I have discovered the joy of capturing great images that you just cannot get from a point-and-shoot. I think once you see the quality you can achieve with a better camera, you will be thrilled with the decision to spend the money and the energy. And Nikon has truly produced the best camera at this price point in the world. It's a pro camera with an amateur price and it's very easy to use. Words really don't do it justice; you need to experience it to understand.Any questions, please send me a comment.

I ordered the D90 as soon as it was available, and I cannot say enough good things about it!  The pictures are incredibly sharp, clear, and Nikon colorful.  I have gone as high as ISO 2000 with no recognizable noise (unless zoomed in).  Even at ISO 3200, it was comparable to my D40 at ISO >800.  I loved my D40 and still think it is a great camera for someone who is just starting out, or for use as a 2nd lightweight camera, or who wants something a little nicer than a point and shoot but still really simple.  However, once you are ready for more, this is the camera to buy.  I have already used the video recorder several times, and while it isn't going to replace your video camera altogether it is wonderful to have.  It is great for the quick video shots, such as at little league baseball -- I don't want to film an entire ball game, but it's nice to have video of my son when he is batting.  (The sound of the crack of the bat just can't be captured on a still!)  So I have been getting great stills at games as well as fun batting videos and end of game celebrations.  Also, I have used it at school programs, at the moment when my son is reeling in a fish, at special moments at the zoo and park, etc.  Some people may think it's just a gimmick for a serious shooter, and I probably won't use it when I am out seriously shooting.  But it's great to have for the user who also has a family and wants to use it to capture memories in their everyday lives.  And that's why I think it's brilliant.  I can't think of any other purchase that I have made in recent years that has as much versatility and opportunity for use as this camera.  Plus, as previously mentioned, I am absolutely thrilled with the photographs that it is producing, and that's what really matters at the end of the day.

However, if you want to be happy with the D90 it's better to think of it as a best in class APS sized sensor DLSR which happens to have a movie mode.(To explain that, most DSLR's have a sensor smaller than 35mm as sensors get more expensive the bigger they go.  Nikons and Canons have one roughly the size of the 1990's era APS film cameras, hence the term.  Several newer and more expensive DSLR's have sensors that are equal to 35mm.)The D90 has substantially better high ISO noise performance than it's predecessors, all the way to ISO 3200.  From some test photos I've seen the D90 even outdoes the D300.  It is fast, responsive, has the new generation LCD that is clear and easy to read.  In general is in every way an improvement over the D200 I used previously except for the inability to meter with manual lenses.  That is an issue for me, but probably not for most people.This shouldn't be confused with full frame sensor cameras like the D3, D3X, and D700.  I have the D700 and the difference in performance is like a Corvette to a Mazda, the D700 also costs a few times as much.The movie mode, which got most of the excitement, is both amazing and disappointing.  Amazing because if you own a lot of lenses suddenly you can do things that used to take a serious pro movie camera; such as truly wide angles, narrow depths of field, and very low light shooting.It's disappointing because it's nothing more than capturing the live preview.  There's no settings to speak of, no external microphone pickup, and as many people have pointed out any motion causes the image to \"wiggle\" on the screen.  This essentially makes it useless for handheld movies, which I bet a lot of people were planning on using it for.I also found a lot of gradient changes (shifting noticeably in steps from light to dark) if you pan around in areas with a lot of contrast, like looking from inside a house to outside the window, even on a cloudy day.  You can program the AE-L button to freeze the exposure, and that does help a lot.Despite my misgivings the movie mode has a lot of potential, just it has to be treated like a \"pro\" movie camera; mounted on a tripod and having shots planned out carefully.As a camera, like I said it's the best APS class Nikon so far, I only wish it could meter with manual lenses.", "Date": "January 24, 2009"}, {"Title": "D300/D90 are fantastic  .... from a long time Canon shooter", "Author": "J.

The new body did not have the same front focusing issue, but after reading a lot of reviews AFTER purchasing, it seems a lot of D90's came out of the factory improperly calibrated, and even Nikon's customer service was telling people, it's faster to exchange it than send it to use for calibration.All that said, the working D90 is great.

One option I also learned about after the fact explained the SOOC (straight out of the camera) softness.

The D90's default sharpness setting is set low (in custom settings), resulting in an apparent softness SOOC.  The setting is designed for working in post-processing the image for sharpness, etc.  However if you don't post-process every image, it does leave you with an overall soft feeling of your images.

I am not a beginner, but let me tell you if I was, this is the camera to get.  It has a lot of buttons but that is no problem, if you don't know what something is in the menu's just hit the question mark button and a descriptive explanation lights up the D90's beautiful improved high res screen.  The screen is why I bought the D90 instead of the D40 or D60, it lets me eyeball my exposure accuratley that way I can make the necessary adjustments to my EX comp, WB, and ISO.  This camera is often compared to the D300, I can tell you this, if you are thinking of buying one or the other, there are only 3 differences between these 2 camera's.  1. If you are a casual shooter who does not need 1/8000 shutter speed then get the D90 with its 1/4000 SS, this is more than adequate for most sports and action shooting. The D300 excels when it comes to faster moving objects, like racecars. 2. The D300 has 51 Autofocus points while the D90 has 11.  You will only need the extra AF points if you are doing really high speed Action, although the AF on the D300 is really sweet, it has lighting speed AF, but like most things in life, people will pay for this feature and never use it, thats where you will save you hard earned cash buying the D90.  3. SIZE, the D90 is a lot smaller and weighs less, due to the fact that the D300 has and Aluminum frame, and better weather sealing, I will say that the D90 is no slouch in the construction department though it feels very well built.  So if you are really pondering which one to get, I say for most purposes the D90 is a year newer, has video, the same picture quality and low light capability (except for the AF of the D300, which focuses a bit faster in lowlight) You can save 500 bucks, and get better Lenses,  I shoot Nikons pro glass with my D90 and love it, I have the 70-200 VR 2.8, and the 24-70 2.8 and let me tell you there is no comparison.

Or if you cannot afford those lenses, then get the D90 body and the 16-85 VR Nikon lens, you won't be disappointed.", "Date": "December 10, 2008"}, {"Title": "Fantastic still camera; lousy video camera", "Author": "Pete \"Pete\"", "ReviewID": "R2P7NGMFTQPL5P", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I upgraded from a D80, which I really liked also.  The D90, for still pictures, is a great improvement, and takes excellent pictures.  The light metering is much improved, and the Active D-lighting really does work well.  There are lots of features but also program modes, so you can get as complicated or simple as you desire when setting up for shots.  Also, high ISO works much better than the D80 ever did.  For still pictures, it's a 5-star camera.Video on the D90, and Live-view for still pictures, is lousy.  Auto-focus does not work at all in video mode, and after taking only a few hours of video, my sensor developed hot pixels that were not there when I first got the camera (I thoroughly tested it as my D80 had some hot-pixel issues).  Most importantly, the hot pixels were obvious even at ISO 400 at 1/30\"!  I took the camera back and got another with which I have not shot any more video, and so far so good - a couple thousand shots later and I love the camera.Live-view is also not very useful.  In Live-view the camera changes to software auto-focus which works terribly in actual-use situations.  It hunts and hunts and usually I have to switch back to regular view and break my neck looking through the viewfinder (since I was using Live-view for awkward shots).  Now I use Live-view seldom if at all and just make due.Video and Live-view get 2 stars, but they are not the real point of the camera anyway, so overall it's a 4 to 4 and a half.

I've always have high regards for Nikon cameras but thought they were more expensive than I care to spend (and when compared to Olympus or Canon prices).When my 2-year-old Canon XTi started malfunctioning(totally useless for flash/low-light photography) and with the high out-of-warranty repair costs to get it fixed, I started looking for another dSLR.  My choices were Olympus E620, Canon T1i and Nikon D5000 in one class group and Canon 50D and Nikon D90 in another class group.I really really like the Olympus E620 (as I did with my old OM-10 which I still have today) - everything about it shines except for its average IQ above ISO 800.  Low-light/High ISO IQ is very important to me and is the top deciding factor when I was doing the comparisons, all else being equal.My experiences with my 2 Canon's can be compared to my cooking - 59% success, 40% misses and 1% brilliant hits that amazes even myself :)  Basically, I had to work harder to get a brilliant shot with my Canon's.  This is partly user errors and partly camera's average focusing/metering precision.So, it came down to D5000 and D90.  The D5000 doesn't autofocus with older Nikkor lenses and there were a couple of recalls on certain production batches.I bought my Nikon D90(plus the 18-105mm kit lens) from amazon.com a few weeks ago and it was my very first Nikon.  I was excited and apprehensive at the same time.  I know that if I like it enough, I'll start spending/buying other Nikon lenses and my Canon's camera bodies and lenses would start collecting dust.After 1 week and 200 shots, WOW!  This camera is like my wife's cooking - 98% brilliant hits and 2% misses.  Everything(almost) about it is beyond reproach.  I tried to find fault with it but every test I threw at it, it passed with distinction.  The IQ, focusing/metering precision and speed, design and engineering are the best I have had seen in this class.  ISO 200-3200 are very useable.  ISO6400(the max) is also useable in a pinch but I would invest in a faster lens (which I did in a Nikkor 50mm f/1.8) to stay within ISO3200.Low-light shots without flash are sharp and color perfect.  Daytime shots are punchy and crisp.  Flash fills are just right - no bluish tint.  There are more focusing/metering adjustments than I know when/how to use.  This camera leaves me breathless :)One of the best features is the \"My Menu\".  With the hundreds of adjustments and options, I had to trim them down and I narrowed down my most frequently used functions to these 4:1) Picture Controls (various levels of sharpness/saturation with default ADL on)2) WB settings3) ISO settings4) Autofocus-Area (Point, Dynamic, Auto-area, 3D-tracking)and I programmed them into \"My Menu\" for quick, easy access.

After reading all the \"professional\" reviews and the consumer reviews, I was starting to drive myself crazy! Canon? Nikon? High end? Low end? It got to the point where I realized I over-researched and my poor brain was fried. So I just decided to pull the trigger on the D90.Now, to be honest I had to return the first one because the flash broke almost immediately (it wouldn't stay closed) and I was getting the infamous lens error message. So I started to second guess my decision. I returned it to Amazon (which took forever, probably because it was over the holidays) and I didn't have my camera for Christmas, which was disappointing. But Amazon eventually got their act together and sent me a brand new camera after I returned the first one. And guess what? I got the lens error message during my first shoot! Amazingly frustrating to say the least. But I reset the camera and haven't had an issue since.I've shot around 2000 photos at this point and am thrilled to death with this camera.

So much fun!", "Date": "January 25, 2010"}, {"Title": "Great Camera", "Author": "Rick Jensen", "ReviewID": "R2DZ0UHQSWNM32", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This is my first DSLR, and I couldn't be happier. I read endlessly about different cameras before I decided on the D90. In the end it came down to the D90, and Canon's 50D, mostly due to their price points. Both are truely awesome and feature packed camera's. I loved the feel of the 50D, as I have pretty large hands. The 50D is about a half inch wider than the D90, and a slightly larger grip. The D90's grip is great as well, just a little smaller. Because of this, I purchased a battery grip along with the camera (Zeikos ZE-NBG90), and it feels great. (If you're wondering why I'm only talking about Nikon and Canon, it's because both companies have an extensive range of products for all skill levels, so plenty of room for me to upgrade bodies and lenses in the future. They are also both extensively used by professional photographers, so there must be something good about them.)A few things made me ultimately buy the Nikon D90.....First, the included kit lens. Nikon includes a 18-105mm VR lens, and Canon includes a 28-135mm IS lens. Both have Vibration Reduction/Image Stabilization, and both cost about the same if you bought them separately. On a crop frame camera (aps-c size), which both of these are, The 18-105mm is more usefull and versatile as an all purpose lens. I felt that it would serve better indoors, in smaller spaces, than the Canon lens would. For other beginers out there, on a crop frame camera you have to use a multiplier to figure out what the actual range is of a lense. For Nikon, it's 1.5, and for Canon, it's 1.6. So my Nikon 18-105 lens functions like a 27-157 on my D90 crop frame (18x1.5 , 105x1.5)The included lens on the Canon 50D is 28-135mm which, on the 50D, would function like a 45-216mm lens. This would be a great range for outdoor use, but I felt it didn't get wide enough for indoor use. This lens mounted on a full frame camera would be more appropriate (no multiplier). In Canon's defense, there are two other 50D kits available, one with a 17-85mm lens, and another with an 18-200mm lens. In my opinion, both lenses are inferior in quality to the 28-135, and they both are more expensive. The 17-85 kit was about $200 more, and the 18-200 kit was about $400 more. This made the 50D to expensive for me, especially when you could step up to the Canon 7D for $1500(body only) and $1900(with 28-135mm).Second are the number of buttons, and button placement. Everyone is different, and has different ideas about how cameras should be set up. For me, I like the idea of having more buttons on the outside, as the Nikon does when compared to Canon. If I have to go into a menu to get at a certain function, chances are, I'll forget I have that function. Being a beginner, I wanted as much in my face as possible to help me learn. This also makes for very fast adjustments for beginers and advanced photographers alike. As for button placement, the Nikon just felt more natural. Again, everyone is different.Lastly, I considered both Nikon's and Canon's full line of cameras. I do plan on upgrading in the future, so I looked at the upper end cameras as well. Whatever lenses I buy for my D90, I want them to work on whatever body I might upgrade to in the future (lenses are expensive!!!) I think I just liked Nikon's take on photography tools a little better. From styling to functionality, Nikon just seemed more... me. I may regret this, as Canon also makes outstanding products, and it seems like they have a lot more lenses, although I havn't actually counted. For now, I'm looking forward to a long relationship with Nikon, expecting that their more pricey camera bodies function as naturally and comfortably as the D90 does.I absolutely love the Nikon D90, and am very happy I bought it. I feel it's a great camera for beginers, and it'll grow with me as a photographer. I was able to create amazing images right out of the box. It's very easy to use. I sat on the couch with it that first night and just played with menus and settings, and learned my way around the camera very fast. I'd recomend the D90 to anyone, beginners and advanced amatures alike.I used cameralabs.com extensively before I decided on anything. Outstanding website with a lot of writen and video reviews on a great many cameras and lenses. Thanks Gordon!!A few tips if you buy the D90...*an 8g memory card will give you about 350 RAW+JPEG shots, or 1000+ JPEG shots*the D90 shoots video... barely.

Returned and got a brand new replacement, after 10 days and 500+ shots, finally received the \"F- -\" error again. The fix to the \"F- -\" error is to remove and remount the lens and hopefully it will not happen too often. Hopefully will not get the \"Err\" message, this is worse, if it does happen, I will have to send it to Nikon for service and wait 2-3 weeks to get it back.I'm \"REALLY\" picky when it comes to choosing a camera, it \"HAS\" to produce satisfactory images to my eyes. For the $1000 range, it's either this Nikon D90 or the Canon 50D. After seeing a bunch of comparison images between the two cameras and their pros and cons, I found that the Nikon is a bit sharper, more accurate colors, less noise with higher ISO (even though Canon claimed to have an edge in reducing noise). I apologize to all Canon 50D die hard fans, that's my honest opinion, unless I need glasses.One more thing, after spending a $1000+ on a DSLR and expecting good quality images and wanting to protect the camera lens, I recommend investing in a good multi-coated UV protection filter. The one I bought is the UV Filter for Nikon D80 D90 Kit Lens - Tiffen 67mm Digital HT Ultra Clear Multi-Coated UV Protection Filter. Low cost non coated filters tend to create too much glare.----------------------11/9/2009 UPDATESo far, the new replacement camera is not having anymore problems with the \"F- -\" error and NO \"err\" message yet.After 1000+ shots, for a kit lens, the sharpness is really good and the Vibration Reduction feature is very useful, an excellent walk around lens. Would've been nice if it was like the lens that came with the D80, 18-135mm, but with VR.

Polito", "ReviewID": "R1TTMPPUNDYYD5", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Review Update (June 30, 2009)You have read the reviews. This pro-sumer camera is just that damn good.I even bought one for my girlfriend.I have been relentlessly using this camera ever since I bought it back in September 2008 when it first came out in the market. So let me just focus on how you could realize and maximize the Nikon D90 experience.If you are in a tight budget and a beginner/intermediate in DSLR, the D90 with 18~105mm kit lens bundle is a good place to start. I have used and brought this fine piece of equipment almost everywhere I travel and I never encountered any of the lens mounting nor memory card errors mentioned by a few in the review. If your have extra $$$ to spare, I would recommend that you get the D90 body only and get the Nikon 18~200mm f3.5~5.6 VR as your ultimate walk around (general photography) camera set-up. If you already own your set of lenses you should just skip the bundle and just purchase the body since you probably established your lens and set-up preferences.For portraits and low light photography, I absolutely recommend the Nikon 35mm f1.8 DX on the D90. Absolutely \"DX DSLR photography heaven\" in my book. The bokeh is creamy and the focal length gives you a lot of footwork freedom compared to the 50mm and 85mm primes in close environments. But don't let me discourage you to get the 50mm f1.4 and 85mm f1.4 lenses. Those are great lenses with bokeh to melt for. I just find the 35mm as the best focal length for my style.For those who want a real pro-level general photography set-up with the D90, get the 17~55mm f2.8 DX and 70~200mm f2.8 VR plus the 35mm f1.8 prime lens. This would be a reasonable (cost effective) alternative to the holy trinity of Nikon lenses: 14~24mm f2.8, 24~70mm f2.8 and 70~200mm f2.8 VR.The size, weight and grip of the D90 is about right for an average person. The outside construction is made of good quality plastic and rubber which has been proven to be tough enough to withstand moderate impacts and deal with the elements of most environments.The menus and controls are so easy to use. You can actually start using the camera and survive by just browsing the screen and by reading the quick start manual without reading the full manual booklet.I absolutely recommend that the Picture Control settings on the menu be configured from Standard to VIVID to maximize color and contrast. Trust me on this one, this makes a huge difference in the tone of the pictures off the bat.Shooting in low-light, even with the kit lens alone, is pretty good because of the wide ISO range of the D90 and plus the fact that the kit lens has Vibration Reduction. Several reviews downplay the 18~105mm kit lens because they overlook the fact that it is probably one of lowest priced wide-standard-telephoto focal range VR lens in the Nikon line.Also, be aware that the exposure compensation controls are easily accessible by the shutter button. This is the answer to the several over exposure concerns, which was brought up by a few in the review, when the D90 is used out in bright sunlight. Get a circular polarizer if you prefer an easy alternative.The HD video feature entirely depends on how good you can handle manual zoom/focus controls at the same time. I found that using a prime lens makes it easier since you only have to worry about manual focusing with some fancy footwork. Personally, the video thing came in handy on some occasions but this should really not be the selling point of this equipment. The internal microphone can not process loud low frequency (bass) sound and ends up drowning the audio recording itself.Lasty, I recommend the MB-D80 battery grip for added comfort & total balance. Get any of the Nikon external flash system to the D90 set-upand you can literally shoot under any lighting condition. I have the SB-900 which is so big and chunky it could light up an entire ballroom with a cloud of soft light. Those who own any DSLR camera, regardless of brand, should only use the internal pop-up flash as the last alternative source of light.Hope this review helped you decide.(below is my September 2008 Review)Just do yourself a big favor and just get this camera... happy days will soon come... Excellent control and user interface layout... low light photography with the kit lens alone is a knock-out!... 4.5 frames/sec. got you covered for action shots... the HD video feature is a plus... but you'll be turned off by the mediocre audio quality...

I am a picture taking fool but a novice when it comes to all the options on this wonderful camera, and thus I will be describing the camera in simple terms. Some of the big pluses thus far is the ability to capture a picture as soon as you hit the shutter release button. The flash reaches out MUCH further than did my previous camera, making low-light pictures much brighter without washing them out. The thing I love the most is that the D90 will sharply focus in low or no light. When in a dark environment, simply press the shutter release button halfway down to focus. If the camera senses that you need a flash, the flash automatically pops up. When this happens, a small light comes on in front of the camera for a second or so, allowing the autofocus to see the intended target. This is something my previous camera would not do, and thus I lost countless pictures in low-light situations.....but never again. The snap-on protective cover over the monitor is a big plus as well. I know the D300 does many things the D90 won't do but the D90 just feels better in my hands. The difference in picture quality between the D80 and the D90 is VERY noticable, especially if you do much cropping on your pictures. I considered buying a D80 when the D90's came out, knowing that they usually drop in price when a new model comes out. I am glad I forked over the extra $$$ for a D90.

I was not disappointed.  Though I have been a Canon user most of my days, it was not difficult to make the switch even given the brief time I had give myself to get familiar with the new camera.  In many ways I found it to be more intuitive and user-friendly than the Canon.  I returned only days ago from safari and on first viewing the pictures look great -- sharp, vibrant, great contrast -- even the phots taken late in the day and into the evening.  As for the video, I am generally very pleased with the results.  The only problem is that the lack of continuous AF in video mode meant that animals were walking in and out of focus, and I find that manually focusing while in live view is touchy at best.  But that's a quibble.  One issue that I encountered is that on at least 3 occasions during normal use, the camera would freeze up, with a flashing \"ERR\" message and [CHA] in the brackets.

The D300 was built like a tank, and shot close to 9 frames per second with the external battery pack.  Although I was able to deal with the complexity of the D300, my wife wouldn't touch the thing - it was just too intimidating.Our son graduated about 6 months ago and went off to college, and I decided the D300 was overkill for my shooting needs.  So I sold it for $1200, bought a D90 body to go with my existing lenses, pocketed the extra $300, and never looked back.  The D90 doesn't have the D300's frame rate, or a few other esoteric features that I never used, but other than that the D90 is truly a superior camera.  In particular,- The D90 is much lighter weight and more compact,- It has a \"Full Auto\" mode that my wife is comfortable with,- 720p video (though I haven't used it much), and- Better ergonomics and ease of use.This is the least expensive DSLR in Nikon's lineup that autofocuses with the lenses lacking internal motors for focusing, like my Tokina 11-16 wide zoom.

There are several good books for learning to use the D90, I recommend David Busch's \"Nikon D90 Guide to Digital SLR Photography.\"  Also, Ken Rockwell's web site has some great advice on which settings are worth fiddling with, and which should be left untouched.I know a lot of serious photographers tend to sneer at the APS-C sensor size (which Nikon refers to as DX), opting for the higher-end FX models with larger sensors.  While their particular needs may dictate the need for such equipment, I am convinced that for typical DSLR users, DX is actually better.  In particular, the lens that is mounted on my D90 over 90% of the time is the amazing Nikon 18-200 zoom with vibration reduction.  This lens is the only one I need to take when I am hiking, walking the Vegas strip, or documenting a family gathering.  You simply can't get a lens like this for a FX-sensor camera - nobody makes such a thing.  It would be an equivalent 27-300 with the bigger sensor, and be ridiculously large and heavy.  With an FX-sensor camera, you would need to haul around at least two lenses to cover this zoom range, and mess with changing them out, exposing the sensor to dust, etc.I was a little worried about the durability of the D90, as it doesn't have the internal magnesium skeleton that my D300 had.  I took the D90 on a long trip to Maui and Kauai a couple months back, with a lot of hiking, throwing the camera in the glove box, and other rather rude treatment.  It never showed any wear or performance issues.  The worst was a boat trip around the north side of Kauai, with a lot of saltwater mist and spray getting on the body and lens.  A quick wipedown back at the hotel, and I couldn't even tell it had been on the boat.  Cold weather use during the Colorado winter hasn't caused any problems either.  After 6 months of severe service, the D90 operates flawlessly, providing consistently excellent images.", "Date": "December 1, 2009"}, {"Title": "An excellent addition to the Nikon line", "Author": "Amazon Customer \"Cook, musician and teacher\"", "ReviewID": "R33ZCNX4OAUNCR", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "First, a disclaimer. I have used Nikon cameras and lenses exclusively for the last 40 years. My father, a professional/technical photographer, used them from WWII until his death in the 1980s. That being said, I have no connection with Nikon except as a customer and have never received compensation of any kind from Nikon. I'm not a Nikon fanboi...er...fangeezer although I have a closet full of Nikkors that pretty much lock me into that brand.This is a dynamite camera! I base that conclusion on several thousand pictures taken with the D90. I'm not going to take readers' time reciting all the features and specs that have been more than amply discussed in other reviews and in the online photographic literature. Instead, I will review a few practical considerations that often are omitted by others.1. The camera feels good in the hand. It is heavy enough to be stable yet not so heavy that it becomes a burden in a long day of shooting. The grip works well for large hands like mine as well as the small hands of my nieces and nephews. And the 3\" LCD on the back is gorgeous. These tend to be sniffed at by experienced SLR users but I've learned to love it.2. The camera is easy to use--for a DSLR. Like any serious camera, it requires study and practice to master the controls so that one can access the desired functions quickly. This is NOT a P&S; and probably is not the best choice for the technologically inept although there is an auto function for beginners that will produce perfectly fine snapshots. More importantly, as the learner progresses, or for the experienced photographer, there are a very large number of readily accessible settings that have been described at length by others. The bottom line is that some excellent human engineering has gone into making the D90 just about as functionally efficient as any DSLR in the market.3. The build quality is excellent. To be sure, it has a plastic body over a magnesium chassis but the materials are solid and the fit and finish are very nicely done. Nothing, with the possible exception of the door for access to the SDHC card, is lightweight, fragile, or flimsy. Durability and reliability should not be issues unless one is going to take thousands of pictures under adverse weather or rough handling conditions. I have noticed a number of experienced professionals using the D90, usually as secondary but sometimes as primary.4. The D90 is far more capable than most of the owners who will use it--including me! An individual who really needs more image/camera control than the D90 provides is very likely a pro who will choose a much more expensive model, anyway. In other words, don't worry about outgrowing the camera; you won't.5. I don't do video so I offer no personal opinions here except to note that within another year or so HD video will probably be available on virtually all DSLRs. I understand that the video capabilities of the D90 are kludgy in some respects, particularly with regard to the lack of autofocus, but I'll leave that for others to discuss.6. This is the question I'm asked most often: \"I have a (D60, D70, Digital Rebel, EOS-whatsit, or you-fill-in). Should I trade it for the D90?\"If pride of possession is important, and you can't afford a pro model, then yes.If you are a technogeek who loves to tinker with camera controls, decide whether the new ones on the D90 are a lot more exciting than on your existing camera. If the twiddle factor is high, then yes.If you are unsatisfied with the quality of your pictures then ask yourself the hard question: Is the problem with me or with the camera? As Ken Rockwell has said ad infinitum, the photographer makes the great image, not the camera. If you have the skills and truly are inhibited by the limitations of your current camera, then yes. If the bottom line is cockpit trouble, then no, grow into what you have before you move on.At any given price point, Nikon DSLRs have only one serious competitor, Canon. All the others are basically also-rans. That is just a personal opinion so please don't write nasty comments about how dare I say that. Are Nikons better than Canons or vice versa? Frankly, I don't think there is enough difference in quality to worry about for two seconds. When I hear or read passionate advocacy for one brand over the other, I tend to suspect testosterone deficiency. Try both; choose the one you like better. Just keep in mind that as you accumulate glass it is going to become more and more expensive to change from one to the other.If you select the D90, I think you'll be thrilled with it.

Turner", "ReviewID": "RXTPP8PNMX0W6", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "For some time now I have gotten by with a compact camera with a small sensor that would take fine pictures if you had all day to wait for the thing to start up, listen to the motor whine as the lens zooms in and out to frame the shot, and wait for two more intervals for the camera to focus, expose and record the picture before being ready for the next picture. All that is gone. The D90 is fast. It lets you fire the camera up, frame, focus, and shoot as quickly and often times more quickly than the old film-type SLR's. It is so fast to expose I can easily catch things in mid-air which was something I could do only by sheer luck with the smaller camera. If you are a former film-SLR photographer as I am, the fundamentals of exposure for movement and depth of field are easily implemented with intuitive and convenient controls and menus. My other camera is a Canon G3 and I was concerned that I might suffer confusion between the two cameras but the Nikon is quick to learn and I now prefer it. While the D90 with an 18-105mm lens is relatively large and heavy, it fits nicely in the hands and feels like a real instrument. The 18-105 lens hits the sweet spot for focal lengths, going from wide angle to moderate telephoto and while I had thought that I might need to get a 55-200mm lens I'm not sure I will need it unless a very special need for a longer lens comes along. The viewfinder is excellent and I am glad to be back to using one but the high resolution LCD backpanel is a joy to behold and wonderful for reviewing shots and in live mode for videos. I have had the camera for a month and have gone picture-crazy with it including our Christmas vacation. Pictures are uniformly sharp and beautifully exposed with the usual foibles in tricky or low light situations that are difficult for any camera. Performance with the built-in flash and with an external SB-600 is as close to flawless as one could expect and better than any other camera I have used. Finally, the ease of switching over and capturing great video is outstanding. The 30 frames per second capture rate produces smooth, well exposed video. I have seen criticism that the automatic focus does not work in video mode which is true. You focus initially and start the video and the focus stays there but you can use the zoom. I have not found the focus issue to be a big problem because the videos I take do not typically go from distant to close focus but it is an option to use the manual focus ring which does work in video mode. All in all, what can I say? Photography is fun again.If I had a gripe, it would be that some cameras like the Canon open a new folder in memory for pictures taken on different days and the Nikon does not. This is very handy to organize pictures if the camera is used over a period of days before downloading the shots to a computer. One other niggle is that the camera does not shut down automatically if it is not used for a period of time. Battery life is qood, by the way, but not so good if you forget to turn it off.  Otherwise, I love the camera and while it is not cheap, it is actually a good buy for the features. In default mode this camera takes pictures that average 3.1 MB in size so lots of hard disk space and a capable computer are recommended.", "Date": "December 31, 2008"}, {"Title": "It's the iPhone of Nikon cameras", "Author": "Seth Johnson \"friend to Tasmanian Tigers\"", "ReviewID": "R3IYEDZ7ILGFEQ", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I'll admit up-front that I have only spent one day shooting with the D90 and have upgraded from a Nikon D70. The D70 was a great ~$1000 camera which I bought immediately upon its release. My photography improved dramatically with that camera and I had little motivation to invest in a new camera body.That complacency lasted until I heard about the D90. I wanted to explore HD video recording using my collection of Nikon lenses. I also wanted to increase my ISO to 3200 for night photography. Also, my D70 was having difficulty recognizing memory cards, so it was time for a replacement.The best way I can describe my upgrade experience is that using the D90 after three years with my D70 was like switching from a monochrome nokia phone to an iPhone. This camera is packed with useful features. The high-resolution screen on the back allows for impressive zooms that can verify in the field beyond doubt if you got the detail you wanted in your picture. It's got in-camera organization of your images however you want. You can store them to different folders on the memory card, sort them by date, and even have the camera record every image in RAW and JPEG.Most everything is pretty much in place between the two cameras. Adapting to the D90 is fairly intuitive, but there are several display fields that I have to look up in the manual because I don't know what they're referring to. The interface is so intuitive, it also contributes to the iPhone analogy I made earlier. This is a well-thought-out device. You can see the years of product research that have been invested to making the user experience rich within the D90. Doesn't make sense why they chose Ashton Kutcher to be their spokesmodel.If you're considering this camera, I'd assume you're already well enough versed in the world of photography that the following recommendations are of little value. I provide them for someone who might be considering a significant upgrade in their camera kit from a point-and-shoot.Here are some other products that go with the D90 like milk & cookies:Nikon SB-600 Speedlight Flash for Nikon Digital SLR Cameras (most people don't need the SB800- this one is excellent)Nikon 50mm f/1.8D AF Nikkor Lens for Nikon Digital SLR CamerasNikon Zoom-Nikkor - Telephoto zoom lens - 70 mm - 210 mm - f/4.5-5.6 Ai-S - Nikon F", "Date": "December 20, 2008"}, {"Title": "Waited for a whole year before I bought this but was devastated with the frequent errors and freezes", "Author": "Sharath Kumar Jeppu \"creative_cookie\"", "ReviewID": "RVAEWP39NTSVH", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "The Camera would have received a 5 star rating for everything else but one thing that ruins everything for me is the error that it comes up with very frequently and completely hangs.It's been 3 weeks with the camera with infrequent use and it has already  frozen 5 times so far which required me to remove the battery to rest the same.

For the first 4 months we were very happy with this camera.  The screen was much bigger than the D50, the camera was much \"faster\" than the D50, and the pictures were much clearer/sharper.  It also just felt better in my hands.  The video was a cool feature to have, but to be honest, we really have not utilized that.  The trouble started when we went on a family vacation to Disney World.  During that trip, we used the kit lens almost exclusively.  Traveling with a 4-year old and an infant, it just was not practical to be switching lenses.  We found that we got an error message more often than not when trying to take pictures on this trip.  Sometimes it would help if I shut the camera off, popped out the battery, popped it back in, and then turned the camera back on.  And sometimes it would not help.  Family vacation to Disney was not a great time for the camera to malfunction.  When we returned home, we did some online searching and found that this was not an uncommon problem - probably related to the kit lens and maybe the humidity/changing temperatures.  We contacted Nikon, and then mailed the camera and lens back at their request.  We paid over $40 shipping.  We just received the camera back yesterday. Nikon covered the repair under warranty.  We had the camera back in about 3 weeks.Update - After having the camera back for couple of weeks, we are getting the F-- error message again with the kit lens AND a brand new error message - FEE with a 50 mm lens.  Very frustrating. Called Nikon this morning.  They said send it back AGAIN.  This time they will not try to repair it (since that did not work), they will send a new camera.  They said either a D90 or a D5000.  I did a quick internet search and it looks like the D5000 is a lower grade model???  This makes no sense.  I am hoping that the tech who helped me had no idea what he was talking about.  It sure seemed that way.  At least Nikon offered to pay shipping this time. The tech at Nikon did not seem to be the least bit surprised by our situation.  He actually was able to TELL ME what the error messages were before we even described the problems.

Unfortunately after having the same exact problems with two brand-new D90s within 4 short months, I opted to buy a Cannon this go-around. I originally \"shopped around\" and did my research for approximately 12 months before getting the D90. I read reviews, asked friends who also had digital SLR cameras their likes/dislikes, etc. Overwhelmingly the evidence pointed to the Nikon D90. I had a decent camera already, and for the price of the D90 I wanted to make sure that I was getting the \"perfect\" camera because I knew it would be a camera that I would have for a very long time.I purchased the camera in October 2009. LOVED IT IMMEDIATELY. However, after about 4-5 weeks of average use, I started getting error codes. I read the manual three different times trying to figure out what to do.First the top display would read & blink \"err\" - which is stated as a camera malfunction.Second and third times display said F - - which menas no lens attached. (There was one of course)The only way to remove the error messags and to get the camera working again is to remove and replace the battery. Even this didn't always work.So, I returned the camera to BestBuy (I had purchased the Black Tie warranty) and they replaced my camera with a BRAND NEW d90.Fortunately the camera worked wonderfully throughout the Christmas holidays and I was ecstatic that I did not have any error codes. However, when we had an extrememly rare \"snow day\" in January and I wanted to get some pictures with my kids, the camera just completely froze up. I had read about some issues with the SD card, so I switched out the high quality SD card and with a regular SD card that came out of my husband's little point-and-shoot camera. This seemd to work temporarily, but ultimately I kept getting the same error codes & messages that I got from the first camera.Needless to say, I was extremely disappointed.

The Nikon D90 is my second camera. It has replaced the D200 and D2X as the second camera.  I considered the D300, comparing the D300 to the D90.  I chose the D90 for several reason.  The internal processor of the D90 and D300 is just about the same, 99% of the people would not know the difference.  The D300 may be faster and have more metal, but I was going for a lighter ( weight) camera that I can carry all day.  The D90 has become just that.

It has been completely reliable. The pictures are excellent quality -- that's a camera statement, not one about my skills.At this point, I have one lens for the D90 -- Nikon's 18-200 mm DX VR zoom.

Suffice it to say, the numbers don't lie!The D90 has a LOT of functionality. Adding function to a product increases complexity and can make it harder to use. Good product designers get around this by picking defaults such that the function doesn't require user attention unless s/he so wishes. The D90 is excellent in this regard. You can start shooting nice pictures with it in auto mode or the programmed modes fairly quickly.

I didn't notice it on the LCD screen because i hadn't zoomed in enough to see it on my photos in camera.  But once I viewed my NEF files from the camera on my computer, I noticed a white spot in the exact same location on every photo I took.  So I contacted Amazon for a return.  Amazon's service was amazing!  They had shipped me the replacement D90 the next day, and the camera arrived the day after that!So I take the second D90 with me to work, charge the battery, put a lens on, and I went to a dark room and took about 10-15 underexposed shots.  I zoomed in on the LCD screen and scanned across the first image, viewing the whole thing, and I found a single red dot on the image.  I moved to the next image, while still zoomed in, and every image had that red pixel in the exact same spot.  (This red pixel on the second D90 was in a different location than the white blur on the first D90 that I returned.  I presume the white blur was some other defect.)I was pretty mad at this point, but I took a breath and did some searching online because this didn't seem to make sense with my previous experience with Nikon.***It turns out that these red, blue, or green \"hot pixels\" or \"dead pixels\" are a common occurrence in DSLR sensors, and are in fact inevitable.  You WILL eventually have some at one point or another, even if you don't notice them.  It is so common that Sony even programs their DSLR's to automatically re-map the camera's sensor once a month (this tells the camera to turn off those pixels so they don't bother you).  Apparently Nikon doesn't use an in-camera fix like that because when you save the NEF RAW file down to jpg, the dead pixel's red dot is automatically removed at that point.So, I just wanted to let other buyers know that if you notice one of these \"dead pixels\" in your image, DO NOT FREAK OUT like I did.  I almost returned the second D90 for no reason.  These dead pixels are unavoidable, no matter which camera you buy.  Please search online to learn more about them and how others deal with them.With this in mind, I still give the D90 5 stars because it is just a natural occurrence.PS - another thing, if you shoot in NEF RAW format, and use Lightroom or Photoshop for editting (and you don't use any of nikon's software), then the \"Picture Control\" settings in camera will not be useful.  The information for those settings are not read by software other than Nikon's software, but the LCD preview will reflect those settings.  What this means is your preview on the back of the camera in the field will not match the camera's actual output that you see in LR or PS.

The D90 is essentially a maturing of the old D70/D70s line with 12 MP sensor vice 6 MP, and a 3\" LCD screen vice 2\" for the D70s.  The D90 has improved auto focus over the D70/D70s.  The live view is not what I anticipated in that prior to taking a still image the mirror has to be released to the down position before being retracted a second time and then exposing the sensor.  This obviously introduces delays and in some cases undesirable vibrations.  Missing on the D90, but present on the D200, is the two step mirror up option for taking photos where the mirror is first retracted, virbations are allowed to dampen, and a second command releases the electronic shutter to capture the image.  This is important for longer exposures and situations where a high magnification lens (e.g. 800-1200mm)is used on a tripod.  Also missing from the D90 is a user defined time-lapse video capture mode, similar to what the Nikon P6000 provides.  It would be a big benefit to include a 1, 2, 5, 10, 30 second user selectable inter-frame delay option for taking time lapse videos of flowers blossoming and other instances where time needs to be compressed.

Upon first grasp of the D90, it feels instantly solid and purpose-built; all the buttons are perfectly placed. I hate it when cameras get in the way of my shot; the D90, when set up to your personal tastes, will let you quickly adjust anything that needs tweaking so you can get your perfect picture.Noise, sharpness, color/contrast, and dynamic range are all perfectly controlled. ISO 1600 often reveals very minor to slightly noticeable noise, easily corrected in Photoshop. Even with the 18-200 VR lens, a lens known for sometimes being a bit fuzzy, you'll get your shot, provided you focus and adjust correctly. Dynamic range is improved thanks to the greatly improved D-Lighting, making skies bluer and highlights a bit more detailed. I don't really use RAW for my pictures (bit slow and cumbersome), and the only reason I ever WOULD use it would be to recover some detail in shadows and highlights; I can forget RAW. Get the image composed right, and D-Lighting will erase any need for that.Movie mode? It's cool.

We want a camera that does what we ask, and when we have that perfect shot composed and ready, it takes it well.", "Date": "March 25, 2009"}, {"Title": "My First Digital SLR", "Author": "dhsphoto \"chess rules!\"", "ReviewID": "R1CMMOE7VMNRQL", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I chose the d90 as my main wedding camera along with the nikon 18X135mm lens.  I am reasonably new to wedding photography and videography and would be considered an amateur by professionals in the photography business.  I have successfully photographed several family weddings including one of my own, and just completed my first real (meaning paid)  wedding for a local family I've known for several years  with the d90.  I chose it since it can be used totally on automatic everything, and has high definition movie capability.  I have only been able to get up to a 4 minute movie which is okay for lots of wedding situations.  I used the movie feature about a dozen times and took a total of 362 images a couple of weeks ago at this wedding.  I use my smaller Olympus SP510 Ultra Zoom on a tripod filming the entire wedding and hold the d90 to get close ups.  I later get family of the bride and groom with the d90 on a tripod.  I found the d90 to be simple to use on auto, but the lens never moved and the instructions say not to adjust the lens when it is in auto move.  So, I adjusted everything to manual during much of the wedding, and was able to take some very sharply focused pics.  The flash was good, but I will get additional lighting prior to the next wedding!  About 25% of the 362 had flaws, but they were my errors, not the camera's.  The 'crop' function on most software will get rid of some errors.  I am simply amazed by the resolution on the pics this 12.3 MP creates.  They are truly beautiful!  The camera is easy to use; I did spend about 2 weeks taking practice shots and videos around the house and studied the manual closely prior to this wedding.  I have a long way to go to learn all of it's capabilities, but one can use it right out of the box successfully and easily.  I use a grip with it so I have two lithium batteries on board plus two more charged and ready if needed.  The camera battery door had to be removed and I could not find adequate information in the manual on how to complete this task, so I had to google it and quickly found instructions online.  The battery door is stored inside the Opteka grip I purchased with the camera in a unique place inside the camera and attached to the grip.  The camera and grip  were bulky at first, but were easy to get used to (I am an average male in size, about 190lbs in my late 50's).  It has 'wheels' or dials that you rotate to activate certain functions along with a big 3.5 inch screen, a dust reduction system and anti shake feature, several scene modes and a relatively easy menu feature. It accepted a 16gb card not on Nikon's list of suggested cards with no problem, and formatting requires the touch of two green labeled buttons on top of the camera.  Download time was great with USB cables supplied by manufacturer.  Again, the two main features I like about it are the incredible clarity and resolution of the photos even at close range and the HD movie capability!  My clients were very happy with the results.  Like the literature from Nikon says, it is:  'A great camera to grow with!'", "Date": "March 14, 2009"}, {"Title": "Amazing Camera", "Author": "Lee \"leebythesea\"", "ReviewID": "R3SUJDSNVGRM5L", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I have been an avid photographer since the early 1980s.  In that time I have seen a spread of photographic technology that ranges from silly (1980s Kodak Disk Camera anyone?) to sublime.  The D90 stands almost completely on the latter description.  I use this body with 3 lenses usually - a wide-angle zoom, a telephoto zoom, and a 50mm primary.  Image quality is truly limited only to the photographer's skill, available imagery, and lens quality.  As an advanced 'prosumer' I generally shoot in either Program mode, Aperature Priority mode, or full Manual mode.  The controls are intuitive and fast, allowing for fine-tune adjustments without significant delay.  The built-in Creative Lighting System flash master is ingenious - I have used the wireless remote flash option (CLS flash sold separately) for a number of shoots to get wonderful results that the paltry built-in flash could never achieve.Indeed, the flash is one of my few complaints on this camera:  It is poorly controlled with the iTTL system - it either shoots too sharply or its power is so low that night shots are sketchy.  Definately get a 'real' flash - it is worth the money!  The second complaint I had was the rear LCD monitor - under the 30-day warranty it quit working, showing only b&w; lines across the screen.  It is disappointing that anything would break in the first 30-days like that, but I guess that's what new warranties are for.  Before it malfunctioned it worked beautifully though - excellent image rendition and the colors were magnificent.  The third area is the gimmicky video mode.  I have used lower-quality digital cameras with much better video modes, but then again I really have no intention to use the D90 as a video cam so who cares anyway!  The last quality area I was disappointed in is the video output to HD-TV.  The images were mediocre at best when shown on TV - to the extent that I thought I shot the entire display out-of-focus and over-exposed!  Alas, printed on paper the images were as-expected so I think the translation to TV was the issue.But for everything that matters on a D-SLR, this camera records phenomenal images - including very large prints, flawlessly reproduces color, works well in low-light conditions, is simple enough for a novice to use (just put into 'Auto' and shoot away), and sophisticated enough for an experienced photographer to truly enjoy....btw, I forgot to comment on the Live View: I have found that this is a useful tool for those times where you want to capture a great image but just can't get it by squinting through the traditional viewfinder. I sometimes catch a shot of bridge architecture or a sunset while driving when I can't safely stop (not that photography at 70mph is safe either...) by using the Live View. First, I set the focus to manual and focus to infinity (autofocus is not happy in LV at car speeds for some strange reason). :) Then I just point and shoot a handful to review later!Update 2/27/09...  I received my warranty replacement a few days ago and everything works like a charm.  Color consistency between the two cameras is perfect - even when changing the various White Balance settings and comparing the results.  I expect that this camera will be a strong tool for quite some time to come - so assume that no further updates is a good thing!  :)Update 10/18/2010... I have been using this camera for over 18 months and for literally tens of thousands of images.  I have not found a single situation where this camera performs poorly beyond those listed above.  It has been used on windy beaches with no sand to be found inside the lens/body junction.  One quirk I'm actually pleasantly surprised about is that the Auto mode actually takes better day-to-day shots than I do in Program mode.  The camera's computer catches minor lighting issues my eye misses through the viewfinder when I'm just out shooting.  The manual and program modes are still invaluable for more tricky shooting (very low-light, artistic rendering, extreme lighting variations such as found at sunset, depth-of-field manipulation, long telephoto usage, etc).Would I buy this product again?  Absolutely.Would I pay new, full price for this product again?

The body construction, SD card(D90) instead Compact flash (D300) 11 point for Auto focus instead 50 ...The price difference allows me to buy an extra battery, memory cards a good caring case, filters, different accessories and in the near future the GPS unit (I'm waiting the releasing from NIKON)The only difference that bothers me a little is that the D90 grip is a little small for me in comparison from the D300  but besides that everything is fine. For this issue you can buy the Nikon MB-D80 Multi-Power Battery Pack, but don't think this will increase the the shoots per second you can take as in the D300, only increases the battery duration and allows you to use AA batteries, also gives you a vertical position shutter button.Very easy to use and understand ALL the functions and buttons, not complicated menus.I bought the Nikon 18-200mm f/3.5-5.6 G ED-IF AF-S VR DX  (the same that comes with the D300 KIT) instead the one that comes with the with because I wanted a more powerful lens and also I read as this lens  is better quality and believe me IT IS AMAZINGIf your are not pro and only want a VERY GOOD DSLR professional style  this is a good and wonderful option, believe meYou'll no regret", "Date": "January 9, 2009"}, {"Title": "AWESOME pictures from an AWESOME camera!", "Author": "JTA", "ReviewID": "R3VCKUSH7UMG6D", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I was waffling between the far cheaper D60 or even the Canon Rebel XSi or the Nikon D90.  I finally decided on the D90 mainly due to the large veiwing screen and the size and feel of the camera.  All of the professional photographers that we have used to take family photos have had Nikon, so I was already leaning towards the D60 or the D90.The Nikon D60 has a 2.5\" LCD display with 230,000 pixel resolution and a 170 degree viewing angle, which means your friends can gather around behind you and everyone will see the same image quality wherever they're standing.The Nikon D90 has a high resolution 3-inch LCD screen. The 920,000-pixel display has a 170-degree viewing angle and appears to be as nice as the new screens found on the D3 and D300. It makes checking focus and using Live view mode that much more pleasant.  Live view is very cool because you can see what you are taking a picture of on the screen or you can use the view finder if it is sunny outside.This is also the first digital SLR to have HD movie mode.  You do have to focus in order to record a movie but this is not replacing a video camera, this is just another video recording source in case you need it while you are shooting great photos.I am so pleased with this camera.  I know it was more than the Canon but the camera FEELS like it should be more than the Canon.  The Nikon D90 feels like a higher end professional Digital SLR camera.  The pictures I have taken so far have been worth every penny.  This was a GREAT purchase and Nikon's support is fantastic.  You can call 24x7 and ask any question.

What I like the most about this camera is the ease of use.  It is by far the easiest camera in the Nikon line yet.  The large LCD screen allows me to see exactly what I am doing at all times.  For me, over 40 years old, I have a hard time seeing the small top mounted LCD so I love this large one in back.  The navigation is so well done and you can navigate all your important settings with a few simple clicks.  As for the actual photos....it's a Nikon - so they are great!  My only word of caution is to beware of the high ISO capability of this camera.  At 3200 ISO I personally do not like the quality of my indoor low light photos of people.  The colors are very harsh.  So I set it to a max of 1600 when I'm shooting people and I get much better looking images.  Other than that it is a great camera.  In all honesty the D40 takes just as good of pictures, but the D90 is more fun to use.  So if you love your gadgets get this camera you won't be sorry.  If money is a primary concern, then go with the D40; it's a great low cost camera -for $550 with two kitted lenses you can't go wrong.

Obviously the 300 is a slightly more professional camera with a better frame, faster shutter, better autofocus, etc., but the D90 is so close to it and comes with a slightly better sensor and is $500 cheaper.  Also, it has video.  Now, before you stop reading because I mentioned that, let me make this statement.  Video had nothing whatsoever to do with my decision.  I had no interest in using a DSLR for video.  But now that I've played with it, I think it is incredible.  Now, it won't replace my camcorder but it will allow me to capture brief (<5 min) videos of things my child does that I would otherwise have to capture by switching physical cameras.  The video quality if frankly amazing.  The sound could be a little better, but is more than adequate.  Now, on to the photography portion.  The image quality between my D40x and the D90  is certainly noticeable.  Pictures are clearer and more vibrant.  All of the features that I used to have to access through the menu system (bracketing, image quality, burst mode, exposure, etc) are all available quickly using buttons and wheels on the camera.  This is making a world of difference.  The kit lens isn't the best by any stretch of the imagination but I have to be honest - it is better than I was expecting.

My impression is this is the ideal mid range DSLR camera. It is has most of the features you need, has great ergonomic and handling. But the most important of all is the excellent image quality especially in ISO 800 and above.Body and HandlingUnlike its main competitor Canon 40D, Nikon D90 is not built from magnesium alloy, but it is still very solid and sturdy. There is no rubber grip like Nikon D300 or Canon 40D either. But texturized plastic is not bad either.I feel the size of the camera is ideal for DSLR, it is not big, but not small. It fits in my hand like glove (I have average male hand). It is not heavy but substantial enough and well-balanced when you shoot low shutter speed without tripod or when you mount it with a heavy/long lens.Nikon D90 has two dials, one to set aperture, the other to set shutter speed or any other setting. Unlike Canon or other cameras handling, Nikon camera requires you to press and hold the button and at the same time dial the setting that you like. This might be annoying if you are not used to it. It is made so to avoid user changing setting accidentally.It also has four way controllers which function to change auto focus points or choosing options in the menu. D90 also has dedicated live view button to activated live view for either still photography or for movie recording. There is a dedicated info button to activate various important setting for the camera. By pressing the info button twice, you can view and change setting of some useful setting such as picture control, noise reduction setting,  active d-lighting, assign function and AE-L/AF-L buttons.The function button can be assigned to many useful setting such as particular metering mode, ISO speed, central focus point, RAW+JPG and some others. The AE-L/AF-L buttons can be assigned to be AF-ON, AE lock only, AF lock only, and some others.D90's viewfinder is not the best because (95% coverage). But it is big enough for me to manual focus accurately in many situations.Least but not all, It has very good top LCD screen that shows a great deal of information: ISO, aperture, shutter speed, metering, picture quality, auto focus mode, battery, continuous shooting, white balance and also the current auto focus point position.The only complaint about handling and control is there is no dedicated button for ISO. The position of ISO button is too low in the bottom of the camera, thus making changing ISO is painful and slow.ISO and Auto ISOImage quality in high ISO is very good, but it is best to shoot at ISO 800 and below. The great image quality in high ISO is due to Nikon sensor and software that control the chroma/color noise out of the image. The noise in Nikon looks more natural compared to camera of other brand.What I like most is the Auto ISO limiter. You can effectively limit the ISO and minimum shutter speed. The Auto ISO works very well and accurate most of the time. My favorite way to use this is to set the camera to Auto ISO, and then use Aperture mode and let the camera adjust the rest for me.LCD ScreenIt is 3' LCD Screen with 920k res which is standard for mid range camera in the late 2008 and 2009 camera. It is very detailed and relatively good in bright light condition.MenuLike other Nikon cameras, I feel Nikon menu is pretty confusing because they throw all over items regardless if the item is popular item or not. Therefore, it might take you some time to find some of your favorite menu items. To be fair, Nikon has my menu tab, where you can choose and put the menu item in this tab. Overall, I feel menu could be improved. Canon cameras menu for example, is easier, more logical and simple to navigate.Auto Focus system & Continuous shooting speedNikon D90 has 11 AF points. Not the best compared to older brother D300, 51 AF points, but it has 3D tracking that is pretty accurate. The AF speed also depends on what kind of Nikon lens you use. Old Nikon lenses usually slower in AF, same as customer grade AF-S lens like 35mm AF-S f/1.8G lens.D90 has continuous shooting speed above the entry level camera (4.5 fps) but it is still not very ideal for sports photography or bird photography (6 fps or better).Creative Lighting System & Lens CompatibilityUnlike lower class Nikon cameras such as Nikon D3000 and Nikon D5000 or older models, Nikon D90 have built-in wireless commander/trigger for Nikon flash units. The CLS system is not perfect because it won't work in certain position and situation, for example in bright daylight, in a great distance, or if the line of sight to the flashes are blocked. But, CLS is fun to use and save you money. Nikon D90 also has built-in AF motor so it is compatible with older Nikon AF-D lenses which we often found in fixed focal length lenses / primes.Video ModeNikon D90 is the first DSLR that has video mode. It record 720p quality video. Although it is not as practical as camcorder, because you need to manual focus and it is hard to stabilized the camera, It is great in low light situation and you can create truly creative video with very shallow depth of view with this camera (using appropiate lenses).CompetitorsIn 2009, the competitors of Nikon D90 includes Canon 40D. Their price is almost similar, but the function is a bit different. 40D has tougher magnesium alloy body and faster continuous shooting speed, so 40D is best for sports. But in other aspects, Nikon D90 beats Canon 40D. Read: Nikon D90 vs Canon 40D.The new Sony A550 also threaten the Nikon D90 position. Sony A550 claims to improve their image quality in high ISO and have up to 5-7 fps continuous speed (AE/AF lock situation).ConclusionSold slightly below $900 body only now, the Nikon D90 is the best digital SLR camera in mid-range category. Like Nikon D70 and D80, I bet this camera will remain very popular for the next few years.  It is great for backup camera for your full frame camera as well. If I have to choose to keep only one DSLR camera for play and work, I will choose to keep  this camera.Subjective Rating - Relative to crop sensor DLSR cameras  * Image Quality: 5/5  * Features: 5/5  * Performance: 4/5  * Body and Handling: 4/5  * Value for money: 5/5Visit my website for sample images and more reviews (click my name for the link).", "Date": "September 10, 2009"}, {"Title": "Expensive, but worth the wait.", "Author": "Erik H.", "ReviewID": "R1ERBK70STQ7JT", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Updated 2/16/10: More than 11,000 shots later!  At ISO's above 800, a few dead pixels are evident against dark backgrounds, but this is something I'm fine living with.  Overall I'm very pleased with the camera and always look forward to using it.  Although possible, capturing good video is difficult and the quality is mediocre  for shooting moving objects.  However, it's GREAT to have in a pinch to capture the unexpected.  And I like it's compatible with older d-type lenses without the AF motor.  I shoot portraits/candids with Nikon's previous generation 85mm f/1.8 and love the results, which would be difficult to achieve without AF.----------------------------------------------------------Addendum 11/4/08: I'm in the process of exchanging my original D90 for a replacement.  I noticed a dead pixel, which I'm reading is common, but I feel that for $1000, the sensor should perform at least as well as my 3-yr old Canon 8MP S80, which has yet to reveal any issues whatsoever... and that's after being dropped and brutalized by our toddler.  Only time will tell if the replacement D90 performs any better.----------------------------------------------------------To be honest, the D90 is a bit expensive compared its competition, and had I started from scratch I might have opted for the Canon 450D or perhaps the 40D, both of which have slightly better image quality (the 450D being much cheaper).  But as I determined 18 years ago when I purchased my fist 35mm SLR after high-school, I found that Nikons just seem engineered for those who desire function over form.  In this regard you could compare Nikon and Canon to the PC and Mac.  Canon's seem a bit too plastic and lightweight, with default image settings built to \"wow\" the customer right out of the box.  That's great, but I sense Nikon has a bit more respect for their customers who want to do more than simply point-n-shoot, especially with a D-SLR.In addition to fit/finish/features, there's an important technical issue I considered.  The crop factor is 1.6 on all amateur Canons DSLRs whereas it's 1.5 on all DX Nikons.  At 1.5, my favorite wide zoom lens, the Nikkor 16-85 DX, equates to 24-127mm.  Very wide with decent telephoto.  Canon's closest lens is the 17-85mm zoom, which at first seems practically identical, but it has an equivalent wide-angle focal length of 27mm.  Those missing 3mm are VERY noticeable (which is why you pay dearly for incremental millimeters of wide angle improvement on either platform).  The D90 was a no-brainer (not mention I already had two good lenses and a flash unit).", "Date": "October 16, 2008"}, {"Title": "Soon to be a great Legacy camera, making it a great value toaday!", "Author": "VINCENT CHEN \"Vincedog3\"", "ReviewID": "R2YXNI0G9KWOQZ", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Hello to all. I'll try not to duplicate what everyone covered excellently already.This cameras days I suspect are numbered making a terrific buy today.  With the D5100 and the D7000, around both outstanding camera values. Even saw a 2 lens D5100 bundle at SAMs Club for only $899.00!  I think the is a better buy today.Ok, then why did I go with the D90 then instead of the cameras mentioned above?  The Legacy in the title says it. my older Nikon lenses have the requirement of the body autofocus lens drive. Meaning the lens itself does not have a motor in it at all. My prime f1.8 50mm for instance, and my 70-300mm. I don't want to buy newer glass.  So with the D90, I can have my cake and eat it too.I wanted to get in on the CMOS imager here, my D200 and D40 which I love in direct sun and plentiful indoor light is a chromatic noise festival in lower light! It kept driving me nuts.  Using noise reduction programs and losing detail.  The D90 just doesn't have that problem. I agree with another reviewer here about usable images to 1600 ISO no problem at all. My D200 is way noisier at this range, my D40 a little better than my D200.Another big benefit is battery life. Outstanding battery life. After a full day of shooting, the battery was only a quarter used. I am wondering if the battery grip I ordered is really needed since the battery performance so outstanding.  My D200 in contrast with battery grip would almost consumed both batteries! CMOS is so much more efficient than CCD.  My D40 is better than my D200, but still really lags behind the D90 in battery life.  It doesn't sound like a big deal, but having juice for that one shot, it is confidence inspiring knowing you'll get shot no problem.I am also a white balance and color nut.  Most cameras have so so performance in this area around specific light like incandescent or fluorescent lighting. The D90 isn't perfect, but it pulls ahead of my D200 and D40 in accuracy. My long time favorite was my Olympus E10. Pitiful in just about anything vs. today, it just gets the color and white balnce so right. If I can take my sweet time, I still love using this old classic. The D90 is close, but I find a bit of tuning here and there with the comprehensively easy white balance setup along with bracketing, and I am a happy camper.It is in the everyday life this camera will supplant my other cameras. The polycarbonate body fits my hand and is well balanced.  The controls so logical, I am at home really being already a Nikon fan since my first D70s. My brother uses that camera now and loves it.The D90 reminds me so much what I love about photography. Being there for the moment. Set it to auto, or program and compose and compose for that perfect image. Or go at it full manual. The command and sub command dials like my D70 make it just so easy. Shutter and aperture at your finger tips right now. Would have liked to have instant ISO control like my D200, but that Is no big deal.  This camera is small enough almost like my D70 and D40, and light, unlike my D200, I can carry it all day with or without the battery grip with confidence.Outdoor shots in my woody environs or taking pictures of the balloons that fly by my place help me realize the relaxed and beautiful place I live and the D90 makes it so fun to share.  everything about the D90 even the quirky movie mode is fine with me. I even had some fun with the rolling shutter malady and made my scary lousy short feature in HD. Making lemonade out of lemons I say.I do believe the D90 is a long term keeper for me. All the right metrics are here.1. Ease of use due to control layout and intuitive menus.2. Lens motor drive in body for your favorite non motor nikkor lenses.3. Low light performance is the best I have had ever with usable images to 1600 or more ISO.3. Light polycarbonate body is mostly all I need in day to day shooting. My Hee Man D200 soldiers on for more inclement conditions4.battery life is outstanding. A full day shooting no problem with the D90 with a single stock battery.5. Overall image quality and balance is great. I find myself more involved in composition than worrying about the D90 unlike my other Nikons. My Olympus E10 though a relic today, still gives me that confidence as long as I am not in a hurry.So overall the D90 delivers much, while sold at low prices today. If you have a need for a Nikon body that can do it all with built in lens drive for your non motor nikkor glass, the D90 will please no end and will meet or exceed your expectations. It did for me.Thank you your time. P.s. I realize that my review, more commentary is lacking the comprehensiveness of others. I just don' t want to cover again what already has been done so well. Though I did want to share because there are users that may have a similar situation and find the D7000 too dear, and the D5100 not an option.

Matheny", "ReviewID": "RER8JEQY1XJH", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Before getting this Nikon D90, we had only used the smaller point-and-shoot cameras and had never owned an SLR.  Anyway, last summer we went on an Alaskan cruise and decided it was time to get something that would be a bit more responsive and take better pictures.  After quite a bit of research, we got this camera body with the Nikkor 18-200mm lens.We have been completely blown away by the results!Aside from portability, this camera is better in every way than our smaller pocket digital camera.  It focuses almost instantly, focuses in far worse lighting conditions, takes amazing pictures, and is very fast from shot to shot.  When it comes to ease of use; the learning curve isn't that steep either - but it does take some time if you want to get the maximum benefit.  One problem I've always had with the screen on point-and-shoot digital cameras is that watching anything on that little screen isn't the same as watching it in person; so I would often forgo taking pictures so I could enjoy the experience.  This Nikon is more like watching through zoomable binoculars so it is far more enjoyable to take pictures.At one point in our cruise, we saw a pod of killer whales and I had been taking some great shots for about 20 minutes when another passenger with a point-and-shoot digital said \"I finally got a tail out of the water!\".  Since the cruise we have also been getting great pictures from our kids' events (like sports games and band concerts) that we could never get before.  This camera was well worth the investment.Unfortunately, only a month or so after getting the camera, it started giving an F-- error and wouldn't focus or take pictures unless the camera was turned off, the lens was removed and replaced, and the camera was turned back on.  This happened pretty much every time we picked it up (which is a lot with 3 kids) and even got to the point where it would happen at random times while we were already using it.I finally called Nikon, expecting the worst, and they were very helpful.  I mailed the camera to them and got it back completely fixed about 2 weeks later.  The only cost to me was the postage to their repair facility (they paid the return postage).  Nikon deserves 5 stars for their great customer service!Overall, I highly recommend this camera; and I think pretty much anyone could use and would benefit from having this SLR over a traditional point-and-shoot.  I will admit that the smaller camera is still handy for keeping in my pocket when we're out doing stuff; but we use this Nikon D90 whenever possible.", "Date": "April 7, 2010"}, {"Title": "After 15,000 pics, still humming along", "Author": "Alan Charness", "ReviewID": "R2K2BEH5BHP9OU", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Picked up the camera when it first came out, and over 15,000 shutter releases later (according to my EXIF photo data), I couldn't be happier with this purchase.Ergonomics: First, the camera has enough weight to it and curves to your hand to just feel solid when you are holding it. After playing around with settings, buttons, wheels, and walking through the manual to read up on everything, I slowly became competent at getting my camera into the right setting for the shot with one hand.Pictures: The low light performance at ISO 3200 is incredible, and combined with the 4.5FPS mode, I've nailed some awesome pics at evening football games from the stands. The pre-set color settings, and built in editing (mostly crop & straighten) definitely speeds up my post-production. The Autofocus took a while to master (center, zone, 3D), but works well now that I have the hang of it. My friends and colleagues are blown away by my shots, but that's more a result of getting some direction on composition from friends and doing lots of culling of the bad ones.Video: Manually refocusing a video mid-shot is a pain. The contrast/brightness/white balance adjustments mid-video can get a bit odd as well. It is a bit rough, but can still produce some nice results if you have a unipod, and not a ton of motion with your subjects. For the most part, video has just been a toy, as I haven't attempted anything serious with it. My $180 Canon SD780IS does better job overall with video, but I can't put a f/1.8 on that, and play around with the focus to get a neat hollywood effect.Lenses/Extras: The lens selection for Nikons is nice (have since picked up a 50mm f/1.8, and a 55-200mm VR to go along with the kit 18-105mm, but envy the Canon 55-250mm IS lens at its similar price point to the nikon 55-200mm VR), and the auto-focus performance on the kit 18-105mm lens is pretty fast. The SB-400 was a nice addition (lets me bounce light for indoor shots and get some good results), but using my f/1.8 without a flash has been a better low light solution, even though the color requires more retouching. In retrospect I would have gotten the D90 with the Nikkor 18-200mm VR instead as changing glass is a nuisance.", "Date": "January 11, 2010"}, {"Title": "amazing...", "Author": "D.

Also because I have heard nothing but good things about Nikon.  Overall I really like this camera.  I would rate it 4 1/2 stars, but since we can't use half stars I will round up to 5.A couple things I want to mention that I am really impressed with:-Matrix metering is really good.  This camera really gets exposure right.-Flash exposure is really good too.  Pop up flash or hot shoe flash.  I am using the SB-600.  I am really impressed.  My Minolta DSLR wasn't so good with flash exposure.-Almost every function you need has a button.  You don't always have to go through menus to change what you want.  Although there are a few things that I wish had their own button.My small complaints about it are:-No custom modes, only the scene modes.  This one is a bigger problem than I anticipated since I do my serious shooting in my studio with tungsten lights, aperture priority, iso 200, bracketing.  It was much easier with a camera with custom modes to be able to turn all these things on or off at once.-Auto bracketing only brackets 3 shots.-No auto focus with movie mode.  I didn't buy this camera for movie mode, but if they are going to put it in, it should have auto focus like any other camera or camcorder.-Slow focus during live view.I was aware of these things when I bought the camera, none of these were serious enough for me not to get the camera because of them.

For an average enthusiast the D90 offers very similar quality as the D300 plus the ability to shoot live video in HD.  Sure you won't have the ability to shoot up to 6 fps and the better build (albeit heavier) body of the D300, but for $600 cheaper I couldn't justify the D300 over the D90.The biggest noticeable difference for me was the huge LCD screen and how clear and crisp the pictures look.  Previously, on the D70s I had to zoom in to check my pictures after each shot but the new LCD screen is magnificent!  I think I read somewhere the resolution on the LCD is equivalent to hd, but i'm not positive.Picture quality is great.  I did not run any technical tests as I would I have no idea how to do them or interpret the results but based on my unscientific \"eyeball\" tests, the quality is great.  I took indoor portrait shots with the ISO cranked up to 3200 and they still came out good.  This is important to me as I take a lot of indoor shots.  I also like the ability to create custom picture quality settings so I can easily/quickly access them to create the effect I want (i.e. vivid, etc).In camera editing.  Sure its gimmicky, but its kinda neat as you could quickly convert your pictures to black and white, straighten the picture, or create a \"fisheye\" effect.Video is a nice feature to have.  I don't ever see the need to take a picture in the \"live view\" function, but having the option to take hd video is nice.  Like most people have mentioned, it takes a while to focus while in live view and it won't autofocus while you are recording.  Also make sure to use a VR lens as I tried to shoot without one and the difference is noticeable.  Another thing to note about video: if you plan on connecting this camera to the TV to watch videos, make sure you realize that the input into the camera is a \"mini hdmi\" input, not the traditional hdmi input.  This shouldn't be a problem as you can find an adapter for under $10, but something to be aware of.The only other minor con I can think of is that this camera uses SD cards compared to the D70s which used CF cards so it was a pain having to get rid of all my old CF cards and buying new SDHC cards.Overall, this is a great camera and a great value as you get a lot of the things from the D300 at a much lower cost as well as the ability to shoot HD video.  The picture quality is great and the additional settings/menus make this a great camera.", "Date": "September 16, 2008"}, {"Title": "My Favorite Nikon Camera Thus Far", "Author": "Timothy Kearney", "ReviewID": "R2Z2ASB3VJ0FEN", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Three years ago I decided to go from film to digital. I was a die hard film user who swore I'd never make the switch and even when I purchased my first digital SLR, I went back and forth between film and digital. The sound of film passing through the camera, not knowing the results and being pleasantly surprised with a set of prints or slides, and the quality of the results of film, especially slide film, all appealed to me. The money saved, these ease of organizing and projecting, as well as knowing for certain that I got the shot I wanted (the joy and surprising results of film was a pleasure only when the results were good, and I shelled out more than I care to admit for lousy results) made me quickly love digital and after using my first DSLR for a while, it soon had the same feel and enjoyment for me.My first DLR was a Nikon D70. I've been a Nikon user (both film and digital) for ten years and have loved the results, especially with people shots. Since I had the Nikon lenses and understand the basics of Nikon technology, it was natural for me to decide to move up to the Nikon D90. Two advantages I like about the D90 are the full frame format as well as the video capabilities which differ from earlier models. While the technology for the video has improved in newer Nikon models, it's still more than adequate, especially for vacations or capturing action in nature photography. I live near the Atlantic coast and I love making day trips to photograph lighthouses, boats, the ocean, etc. I love the ability to get great still shots along with the ease of video. The stills as well as the video makes for interesting presentations. Another advantage of the D90 is better ability to capture images in low light scenes, useful from everything to night scenes to capturing a shot of birthday cake with candles.  Another imporatnt improvement over earlier models is the camera's self cleaning ability. While I often cleaned my D70 while in use and had it cleaned professionally on a regular basis, I still spent what seemed like hours trying to clean up shots in Photoshop due to dust and small particles. With the D90, such clean up work in Photoshop is rare.The program modes of the D90 are similar to other Nikon models: portrait, close up, scenic, night, action. More often than not I use aperture priority and shutter speed priority and on occasion manual mode but if I am just taking candids or do not have the opportunity to us  the light meter,  the program modes work fine. Another option of the D90 is the ability to do some editing with the camera. I like the ability to see a shot on a computer screen and edit using Photoshop, but I have tried it in camera and am pleased with the results, which is helpful if shots need to be printed right away.I waited a year before writing this review. I wanted to use the camera in a variety of situations. I use my camera for pleasure capturing family events, favorite paces, nature and scenic shots and occasional indoor set ups. I also use the camera professionally (capturing events in my work situation). I find the camera easy to use in just about every situation. For me, the ease of use combined with the quality of the results makes this a perfect camera for me and I recommend it to serious amateurs. I also know a news photographer who uses it as a backup with excellent results and I've noticed some wedding photographers using the same camera, usually as a back up. One recommendation I do have is that if you do purchase this camera, you may also want to but a guide such as \"Magic Lantern.\" The book that comes along with the camera is not well written and can be a bit confusing, especially if this is your first DSLR.", "Date": "October 31, 2010"}, {"Title": "Great Camera but a minor flaw", "Author": "Brent Morales \"Brent\"", "ReviewID": "R2GZ8P6THGRMIY", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I purchased this camera in April 2009.

I bought another D90 before the D7000 was available simply because I don't think the 7000 is significantly better than the D90 except for the addition of a few more pixels in the same size sensor.  That does not yield better photo quality than the D90 at 12.2 mp.  Admittedly the 7000 has a higher framing speed but I don't think it's significantly higher to warrant the extra cost.  In essence, my opinion is that both are excellent cameras and why not save a few hundred while you can.

Image quality and dynamic range are superb.However, a reviewer below comments that it could be worth waiting for the D90's replacement, which is due out sometime this fall (or maybe later).  There is a strong case for not waiting and picking up the D90 now.  First, the price may not actually go down that much after the launch of the successor.  Like the D40, the D90 is a milestone camera that will likely continue to be in demand even after its official product life is over.  The D40, which itself has been discontinued for many months, is currently sold by various sellers on Amazon for a couple of hundred MORE than the last official MSRP.  This is simply a function of supply and demand, and the same may be expected for the D90 over time because of how highly it is regarded.  Second, while a new model usually has desirable new features - and there is no reason to think the D90 replacement will not have improvements over the D90, especially with respect to video capability - it may be worth waiting for the launch hype to subside, take in a few in-depth reviews, and wait for any initial firmware updates.In a nutshell, the D90 is a great camera, regardless of what will come after it.

Beginning at age 11, in 1965 and originally taught by my grandfather, photography has played an important part of my entire life.My digital photography began with scans I made back in 1987 using a 'Thunderscanner' that converted my printer into a scanner.More recently, I began photographing using digital cameras beginning in 1997.This Nikon D90 is my 3rd Nikon DSLR. It was preceded by my Nikon D70 and later a used, Nikon D200.Overall, I feel that the D90 outfit, which includes the 18-105 and to which I added the 70-300 nikkor lens is my personal, 'perfect' camera outfit!These two lenses have Nikon's VR (optical image stabilization) which does a phenomenal job, stabilizing your images shot handheld. And the lens's qualities are very good, too. I find the optimum sharpness to be around f/8-f/9 for both of them. There is some chromatic aberration on each at the shortest focal lengths but this is easily removed in software such as the Aperture 3 which is what I use.The 18-105mm lens is the one I leave on the camera a take about 95 percent of my shots with.I use the 70-300mm for longer reach when I need it, especially for small subjects such as birds and other wildlife that are at a distance.I had an old well padded LowePro bag that is about 14\"x14\"x5\" and the camera with both lenses and all of my other personal items (keys, wallet, iPhone, etc.) all easily fit into it and slung over my shoulder so that I can 'draw' my camera and shoot within a few seconds of seeing something worth photographing.With everything in the LowePro bag, including my personal gear, it weighs less than 8 pounds! Not bad at all when you consider I'm set to shoot from the equivalent range of 27mm all the way up through to 450mm.  That is the same view you see with 9x binoculars! Not bad at all!The speed that I can turn on and shoot the D90 is so short that it feels like a film camera! There is almost no delay so I am able to grab shots, effortlessly.I leave it setup with the following camera settings preset ... RAW plus JPEG, Autofocus on, VR on (this is amazing image stabilization in both of my lenses!), Aperture priority (with the lens typically set to f/9 for sharpest image quality) and the amazing Auto-ISO set with a minimum shutter speed of 125 and a max ISO of 3,200.My images are gorgeous ... sharply focused, with no motion blur from handholding the camera and well exposed (note that using RAW files in Aperture 3 makes it possible for me to both fine tune each exposure AND remove the slight chromatic aberration that appears when the lens is shot at it's widest 18 mm setting).Nothing is 'perfect' so, I'd admit that the D90 isn't as well built as my D200 was and because it was the first DSLR that had video capability, the video quality isn't the best.Still, when I consider the cost of the better built D300s (twice as much as the D90!) and that I bought this for serious still photography and not video, this outfit ranks all A's  in my book!My decades of experience has also taught me that Nikon gear holds up much better in the long run AND that is the reason it holds a much higher resale value, too!If you want a DSLR camera with the best LCD (nobody has a better one so far!), a glass pentaprism viewfinder that lets you 'see' what you are shooting, even in low light and the Nikon brand name that means it will hold it's resale value, it is hard to go wrong with the D90 kit!BTW I've ordered the optional battery holder/side hand grip for it.

It has the same sensor as the D300, and capable of taking similar quality photos.  The D90 is also lighter and cheaper, yet offers a lot of features I was looking for (function buttons, two control wheels, 11 focus sensors vs the 3 on the D40, etc.).I got the D90 the day before I left for a trip to Europe, so had little time to play with the camera (other than making sure it was working ok), and time to read the manual on the flight.  That said, there wasn't much of a learning curve to get excellent photos out of the D90.  This camera handles beautifully, with all the important functions falling easily to hand.  I especially like the function button (I have it set to switch the viewfinder grid lines on-off).  I also like the depth of view preview button.

It's speedy, it's accurate, it has brilliant high iso performance for low-light shooting, excellent dynamic range for fixing up pictures that may be under or over-exposed, excellent auto-focus, and just feels good in your hands.

DO NOT BUY THIS CAMERA IF VIDEO IS A FEATURE HIGH ON YOUR LIST, GET A DEDICATED VIDEO CAMERA INSTEAD(I recommend the Canon HF100).  Some DSLRs are capable of taking \"HD\" video now; The Nikon D90, Nikon D300s, the Canon 5d Mark II, Canon T1i, and the Canon 7D, but guess what?  They all suck.  Why?  They cannot automatically focus while taking video.  What does that mean for you?  That means you will never be able to film sports or any moving subjects.  You will never be able to move the camera out of range without insane levels of care to keep your subject exactly in the distance from were your pre-focused it.  You will have rolling shutter aka \"jelly video\" if you pan the camera too quickly.  Yes, you can manually focus while filming to get a professional film look, but that requires a lot of skill and patience.  You will never be able to just point the camera and capture your sons football game, or daughters dance lessons.  You will have to pre-focus every shot, and keep the camera on a tri-pod or buy expensive steady-cam equipment.

So I bought the camera and brought it to work, and a coworker's husband is a professional photographer and he said that the Nikon D90 was his backup camera and he can't tell the difference.  So that makes two pros who unequivocally say it stands alone in its class.So I'm not a pro, and what I can say is that it was very easy to learn, the video quality is also actually quite good, I've been taking pictures that look great, and the battery lasts forever.  Also, any of my friends who know I have a camera drool when they find out I have the Nikon D90.The short answer is this - either trust me that I've had two pros tell me what I've told you, or find a professional photographer and ask them about the Nikon D90.  I'm positive that they will tell you that there's nothing comparable unless you want to spend 5 times as much.Sometimes you just want the expert to point and say - that one, that's the right choice - your only choice.

Budget being an issue here in that I could not go much over $1200 for the kit, which would include the sales tax so that left out anything above the D90.My research revealed a lot of good about the D90, things like better viewfinder, able to auto focus more lenses as it has the in body focus motor, built in flash commander and a better ergonomic layout amongst other things - and has many of the features also found on the D300 as well and I'd also checked out the D5000 too but in the end, liked the D90 better with it's more direct access to the more common features via the 2 command dials and less menu diving for the basics, the better penta prism viewfinder was a boon since I oftentimes find myself shooting in low light, dusk/night while out and about using what available lighting there is and the camera's superb high ISO performance, something cameras like the D80 with it's older CCD based sensors just don't do as well as with cameras that have the newer CMOS sensors.All that said, here are my thoughts on this camera, based on just over 8GB of images or just over 400 shots taken in 2 months time.Metering, the camera even when the E/V is set to 0.0, it still sometimes slightly underexposes things when in either center weighted or spot metering, and it's especially true when using Matrix metering (really good for certain situations where spot or center weighted won't do) so I usually use either spot or center weighted, even though I shoot RAW. Overall a lot of that is what you meter on that will affect how it meters and by that I mean, meter of the bright area of the image and use that to set your exposure or you risk blowing out the highlights if you meter on something dark. One negative is that this camera can be prone to blowing highlights if you are not careful when metering in the first place.Auto focus, from what little I've used it, it seems to work fine but some claim it tends to back focus some (some even claim it front focuses some too), which means that if you focus on the eyes, the focus may NOT be right on them, but just behind or in front of them. I have not used it enough to notice if my particular copy does either as I shoot mostly in full manual mode. Now, to ensure it WILL auto focus, you have to put the camera's switch in AF mode and the switch on the lens to AF to ensure it works, also, you won't see it focus until you half press the shutter to activate it and it is fairly quick to focus in most situations.Ergonomics, I find this camera quite intuitive to use as it has plenty of quick access buttons for dedicated things like the menu, the image playback and buttons with dual functions such as the WB/help/image lock button, the ISO button just below it that also zooms in on images taken and QUAL(ity) button to set the image from RAW to RAW+Jpg or Jpg and their 3 levels from fine to low that are on the left of the LCD screen, the joystick is a pleasure to use and adjusts it's function depending on what you are doing, the LV (live view) button to turn that on and off and a sensor lock switch below the joystick and below that is the info button. On either side of the viewfinder are 2 buttons, one is the delete and the other is the AE-L/AF-L lock button and on top around the top LCD display are buttons to access things like the remote sensor, the burst modes etc, the metering, E/V and Auto Focus settings and lesser used buttons on the front such as flash (flips up the flash), exposure bracketing and the DOF preview along with the lens lock button when un-mounting the lens.This camera has 2 command dials, making it much easier to set shutter and/or aperture or they can control other functions such as when you press down the metering button on top, the back command dial rotates through the metering options, the WB button will allow you to set the WB to either Pre or one of it's other settings (pre allows you to set the WB yourself by taking a photo of something white or gray and it stores it to reference from for WB) are just 1 example. If you press the ISO button and rotate the back command dial, you can adjust your ISO. It may take a little bit to bet used to where everything is but it will fall naturally to your fingers and thumb. I found it quite intuitive to use and now, most things come naturally to me.Grip, the camera's size and thus it's grip to me is just right but I'd recommend you get into a brick and mortar store to fell them out as even within a particular brand, the camera bodies will vary and so will the grip to see if they fit your hand or not. I've heard some people with smaller hands find the D90's grip quite nice, others, not so much (and weight is a factor too) I like that it's a good, solid grip, one that is comfortable to hold - and again, it it all depends on what you are after and what feels comfortable to you.Size/weight, I find that since this camera is 1.6Lbs sans battery and lens, it's not the lightest out there but certainly not the heaviest. I find it about right and can lug it around for at least a couple of hours on foot with relative ease. Size wise, the camera is 5.2x4.1x3.0 inches and with the 18-105mm kit lens mounted, it's more like 2Lbs or close to it as the lens is just over 14 Oz in weight and its size makes for a well balanced kit for everyday shooting.Overall, I find the kit lens itself very sharp, the downfall is when at full wide or at full zoom with the aperture wide open, some vignetting in the corners occur, but it's easily reduced in post processing but otherwise, it remains quite sharp through most of its range and with VR, one can gain up to 2 f stops zoomed in and allows you to shoot hand held and keep the shutter at, at least 1/60s to obtain crisp, sharp images even in low light, something that is not always possible with out it and it's very effective for such an inexpensive lens.Overall I can get some really great quality images shooting at dusk or at night with this combo even though the widest aperture is f3.5 at the wide end and that's possible as I can shoot up to 1600 ISO with relatively little noise, it begins to become noticeable when you hit 3200 and up (6400 is a modified setting where the pixel count drops to keep the noise in check) and is simply called Hi, 100 ISO is the same thing, simply called low. Shutter speeds are plenty, ranging from 30 minute exposures to 1/4000s and you also have bulb mode for long exposures where you press the shutter to open, press again to close it.Live view is a new feature to the DSLR and some manufacturers have implemented it better than others and Nikon could've done better but what I've found is if you want to use it, you have to think ahead and pre-focus, pre-set your exposure before going into it to compose and shoot and I find it helps when shooting up high or low which is really it's intended purpose - and for video shooting but it's crippled greatly in that mode however. I have not used the video mode on the camera as it's not of interest to me. I bought this camera simply to take still photos, nothing  more.Overall, I find the camera quite useful, versatile, intuitive and a joy to use and the resulting image quality is really good and that I take my camera with me practically everywhere says a lot about its usefulness and the 18-105 kit lens's range is very useful for street photography and there are very few times I wished I had a wider lens or a longer zoom so it works for 90% of what one may want to shoot in the way of general photography.Overall, a very good camera for the bit more advanced shooter. One thing to caution is that it may overwhelm some of the less initiated out there as it has so much to offer that a D5000 might be a better choice for some but for the rest, the D90 may well suit you well for most types of photography, just don't expect to get a lot of keepers if shooting pro sports or anything demanding like that for it's burst speed is a mere 4.5FPS while a D700 I think does 8fps and has a much better auto focus system (51 area focus points Vs the 11 on the D90) but overall, the D90 is one powerful - and capable camera for the price.", "Date": "April 10, 2010"}, {"Title": "Best Value Nikon by far", "Author": "dazzler11", "ReviewID": "R27V2OAV5ELB14", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This camera is amazing.

My ability to \"pocket\" my camera is gone but it's a feature I'm willing to give up! It's feature packed, of course and it didn't completely ruin my wallet (the lenses may have but that's beside the point.)How does it feel? Weighty but that's coming from someone who normally holds smaller Point and Shoot cameras. Still, after testing it out for over 30 days it feels wonderful. It fits my semi-large hands perfectly and yes! I am able to handle its weight around my neck for hours. Sure, it can get a little heavy when using sizable glass like the Tokina 12-24mm wide-angle. But it's a wide-angle, they're expected to be heavy.Using a dslr has its learning curve. Which I understood before purchasing it. I read through various books and even a couple that specifically discusses the D90. So for me, it was a breeze to use. Not that it mattered, like P&S; cameras it does have an \"auto\" mode so first time users can start snapping away the second the battery is ready to go. Navigating through the menu system can get bothersome but after a couple days you might find yourself flipping through it without thinking about it. This is where reading the manual will come in handy!Functionality. It's a powerful camera, something I did not see coming until I took my first photo. At the time I used a Nikon 50mm 1.8D lens so it focused quickly and sharp, color me impressed. Battery life is as I expected, maybe a little longer than expected actually! At max I could get a days worth of shots if I ignore using the flash. And stayed off the lcd screen as much as possible. Otherwise two batteries seems about right. The built in flash works for most applications. The only times it really failed is when I use my larger lens, like my Nikon 16-85mm. Using it with the built in flash will cast a shadow of the lens below. Luckily I did know about this beforehand and invested in the SB-600. I do plenty of fill flash photography so it was a big help.Like I said I'm new to the world of dslr photography but I do feel I made the right pick. It's no PRO camera but I wouldn't call it a beginner's dslr either. It's definitely your mid-range type which comes packed with features that are usually found in the more expensive D3 and D700 cameras.

My wife also wanted a camera that would also be easy to use: turn the dial to Auto/No Flash, zoom, focus, shoot.  I wanted a camera I could customize in about every way possible.  We considered the D700, but ruled it out because of size and weight, not to mention price.  Then we looked at the D300 and ruled it out for similar reasons.  While looking at the D300, however, we ran into the D90, a very lucky break indeed.  As far as we could tell (and we're amateurs), the D90 blew away the D300 in very low light shooting.  The results of the D90 are simply amazing no matter what the lighting.  The camera is large enough to be comfortable in my hands and light enough my wife doesn't mind carrying it around.  It's a surprisingly easy camera to figure out, especially with the help of a few Web sites and Nikon's lengthy D90 manual.  The biggest surprise to me is that photos shot using Auto/No Flash are almost always better than photos shot with tweaked settings.  We're shooting RAW, and straight out of Adobe PS3/4, the photos are ready to print.  I'm sure we'll grow into this powerful camera and learn what wonders tweaking can accomplish, but it's great to be able to lean on the D90's intuition while we're in the process of developing our own.  We did a LOT of research, comparing, and shopping to find the right camera, and the D90 is the perfect fit for us.  I usually have second thoughts after a major purchase, but with the D90, my only regret is that I didn't find it earlier.I picked up Nikon's 24-85mm AF-S for peanuts on eBay, and it beats the kit lens hands down.  I also picked up the Nikon AF-S 18-200mm VR that other reviewers have recommended; it's matches up superbly with the D90.  My recommendation is to buy the body only and then match it up with a lens that best suits your needs.  Amazon's price for the D90 is very competitive, plus Amazon makes  exchanges easy if a problem turns up (true of other dealers? not so much).  Same for whatever lens you buy--Amazon's prices are very competitive.  Use eBay to pick up high quality Nikon clear filers to protect your lenses.  eBay is also a cheap source for a backup battery. The battery that comes with the D90 recharges quickly and lasts a surprisingly long time on a full charge.  Still, there's no reason not to have a charged backup.I must admit my wife and I went into the search for the right photos-of-granddaughter camera with misgivings.  What we were after seemed to require a very expensive pro camera.  Happily, we found the D90, an extraordinary camera that's both user friendly and capable far beyond our amateur needs.

I also brought the SB-900 flash to go with the camera and the two combine work superbly. The thermal overload protection on SB-900 is annoying but that's for a different review. Back to the D-90...I currently have not nor do I in the near future plan to use this camera for video so I cannot comment on the video ability of this camera. I'm having too much fun with stills. There are a lot of value added features on this camera. The features I've used the most so far are Commander Mode, Automatic Bracketing and in some post production processes including the D-lighting, filter effects, color balance and image overlay on a some what regular basis. But you don't want to over do it. These processes eat up your battery. The best feature and a great tool for me is the ability to use the camera in the Commander Mode and control several flash units directly from the camera. I've used it with both SB-800 and SB-900 flash units and it works flawlessly. I also like the feel of the camera in my hands. I fits comfortably in my rather large hands and I can reach all the controls without twisting my fingers in knots. I am just using the Live View screen to view the camera setting. It certainly makes it easier to read than look at the readout on top of the camera especially in dim lighting.############## UPDATE ####################It's been eight weeks and I still find this an amazing camera.In addition to the feature listed above I also like best are the 3 inch high resolution screen where you can use \"Live View\" in lieu of sighting the shot through the view finder and the use of the \"Info Button\" to view the camera setting on the larger 3 inch screen. I also love the 11 point autofocus system that can follow the subject as it moves around keeping the subject in focus at all times. As a bonus it also has face recognition for which I find occasional use. But first, the 3 inch LCD screen has great resolution and is well suited to view the shot before or after it has been taken regardless of the environment. You can also call up histograms and other information about the photo you just took. The screen is also great for viewing the camera setting especially in situations where it is difficult to see on the traditional small monochrome LCD located on the top right hand corner of the camera. The camera information is transferred to the larger screen with the push of a single button, the \"Info Button,\" making it much easy for these old eyes to view. The 11 point AF system in Dynamic mode is great for action pictures or in situations where you want the subject to be in focus at all times.

Lacking the funds to buy it when it was released, I substituted a year of obsessive research, comparing the D90 to Nikon's pro series, lesser Nikon DSLRs and Canon.Previously I used a Nikon D1H professionally for a small newspaper and am pleased to see so many of Nikon's initial pro camera features  included in the D90.  It helps that the D90 is many generations up the scale from the D1H and does almost everything that camera could do- but many times better. And the D90 battery just goes and goes and goes and goes where the D1H couldn't handle more than a few dozen shots before I had to go looking for a plug-in.  Even now that I have the D90, I compulsively switch off the camera after each shot, except I get through about 500 shots before the battery evens registers ANY decrease from full charge.  So much for ordering the optional double battery pack!The color and low light benefits of Nikon's image sensor pretty much blow Canon out of the water, though I can't deny already having a small collection of Nikon glass and accessories makes a difference too.Considering this camera is for personal use and I had to pay for it myself, the more expensive pro cameras were always on my wish list but never on my buy list.  Choosing the D90 over Nikon's very similar and cheaper D5000 with its flip-out LCD seemed absurd at first until I realized that with a D5000 I would have to buy new lenses (and lose the cost benefit) and the D90 has somewhat better speed, customization and programmability options. I really like flip-out LCDs (my video camera has one) but lacking this feature for the moment required to compose and take a still picture isn't much of a loss.  For still pictures, I am more comfortable with the traditional SLR view-finder and the standard LCD back panel anyway.  Having fewer mechanical parts to break is good too.I was able to order my D90 just in time for a family trip to Disney World. I was astounded by the camera's image quality, its speed, ability to capture fantastic images in near dark environments and the amazing intuitive design.

I know most people will be like ok if he uses a d90 he must no be a professional it's not a professional body but that's crap. Your picture's are what matter's and my client's could care less if I use a D3 or a point and shoot as long as there image's look great. And this body allows me to capture fantastic image's with great quality in any light. I have used a lot of camera's Nikon d40x, nikon d60, nikon d80, nikon d300, canon 30d, canon 40d, canon 7d, canon eos 1d, canon 1d mark 3, canon 5d mark 2 and I can seriously say I like the d90 the best the only two problems with this camera are that the video sucks and canon cameras with video are much better and that the auto focus even though it is fast is short of a pro auto focus system like the d300 and canon 1d or canon 1d mark 3. This is not really a problem for most people and most shooting situation's except sport's. I shoot sport's all the time for publication's and to sell and I can say that even with a pro lens like an 80-200 2.8 or a 300mm 2.8 or f 4 it can be hard to keep up with the action. Not to say I dont get great sport shot's with it I do but there is a really night and da difference when you use this compared to a pro auto focus system. If it was not for the autofocus I would never need to use another camera. I don't mind the grain of higher iso's like 3200 and even at high 1 or 6400 it dosent bother me to much and if I am shooting black and white I love iso 6400 because it remind's me of shooting tmax 3200 if anyone remembers the days of film but I think it looks great I love the gritty feel. So all I can say is unless you are buying this for a video feature or to shoot sport's full time on a professional level buy this camera it doesn't matter if your completely new to camera's or photography or a professional this camera will suit the needs of just about everyone. Dont even consider the d300 or the d300s unless you shoot sport's all the time. If you want a camera better than the d 90 go to the d700 or the d3 I wouldnt bother with the d300 it's the d90 with weather seals a heavy metal body but again the auto focus is good for sport's that's it's only advantage because guess what the metal body dosent impress me why I try and take care of my camera's but I have dropped, hit, knocked over, shot in the rain shot on the beach in sand and wind, shot in sub zero temperature's for exteneded period's of time I mean most of a day with no problem's, in the middle of snow storms all of that with my d80 or d90 and they both no only preformed great before during and after those situations there both still in great condition. I dont need a heavy metal body to tote around none want's to carry around more weight than they have to and the weather seals do help you dont need them if your carefully. If it rains cover your camera with your shirt or a bag if it gets wet wipe it off when your done let it dry out by a heater and it will be fine just dont get it completely soaked. Dont let people fool you you dont need alot of the crap camera company's or most company's try to sell you to make more money off of you. Buy this body invest in good lenses that is where your money is well spent and worry about taking pictures not you camera shoot in the snow and the rain and hell if your camera breaks you can get it fixed or buy a new d90 and still have paid less for 2 cameras than you would to get a d300.", "Date": "January 20, 2010"}, {"Title": "Great Buy For the Price", "Author": "David Delisio", "ReviewID": "R25RJ48UIBYFU4", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "First off I want to say that I have used this camera for a year now. I am a semi pro, which means I earn a little on the side with photography. I also upgraded from a D50 to this camera. I originally wanted to upgrade to the D300 but for the price and what I use it for I decided to go with the D90. Almost the same sensor and I really didn't need the tank build of the 300. The weather proofing would have been nice though.So far I have been very pleased with my choice. The low light capability up to 3200 iso is fantastic. 6400 is pushing it though. It focuses quickly in lowlight. The body fits comfortably in my hand without it feeling too small like the D40/60/5000. It may feel a bit small if you have large hands though. The battery life compared to my D50 is fantastic. The battery, however, is a bit slower to get out if I need to change quickly. You actually have to pull it out instead of it sliding out practically on it's own. The display in the back is awesome. It may actually be too bright though. I have done alot of Fight promo shots on black backrounds where it's hard to use the histogram to see if your lighting is right. On the display they looked good. Once downloaded I had to boost the exposure by as much as 1 stop. I really can't review the jpg setting as I always shoot in RAW. As far as RAW goes, I read a post on here where someone complained that all his software didn't support the new raw format. No need to buy new software, just download a small file from the Nikon website that allows compatibility with most software. The adobe site has it also. I LOVE the \"My Menu\" feature.As far as the video goes. If you are buying this camera for videoing, don't. It's a nice little gimmick and can be convienient to use in some instances, but it's not a video camera. If you want to video, buy a video camera.I have had a few problems with this camera. The most annoying is when it just stops working because it thinks no lens is attached. I have really only had this problem with my Tamron lenses and can't remember it happening with the Nikons. It was easily fixed by unseating then reseating the lens. I have also lost autofocus with the Tamrons and it was fixed in the same way. When you are actually working with a client this can be both embarassing and annoying. This is the biggest reason I gave this camera only 4 stars.Bottom line is this is a fantastic camera for both beginners and advanced photographers.

I started developing an interest for this when my brother showed me his D300. That is a very intimidating camera. Interest grew when we had a photoshoot and the pictures came out amazing - our skin looked flawless - I swear it made the bags under my eyes go away and very refreshed looking.Motivation to get a DSLR...I have a newborn. I liked the look/color of the pictures that DSLRs took. The files seemed to be better as well, and more options to blow the pictures up or use on websites/digital photo albums looked a lot nicer/smoother/polished. I was slightly discouraged since at the store, all the Nikons had -E- on them, and was told by the sales rep that it meant error...after reading the instruction book, it just meant that it didn't have a memory card in it. DUR!Why D90? I bounced back and forth between Canon vs. Nikon. Then it morphed into which model to get...I looked at the D40, D90 and D300. I factored in price (yes, these cameras are expensive...compared to the $400 models I've bought in the past, but the value of having these memories captured in a higher quality is priceless). After scouring the web reviews and suggestions and comments (D40 seemed to win a lot), I opted for the D90 b/c it has the guts of the D300, and a nicer shell/display option than the D40.FeedbackBODY: It's overwhelming with all the buttons/options/configurations, but I am slowly working on learning each of these. It is heavier than what I'm used to.LENS: We purchased the kit which came with the f3.5 18-105mm. It's nice. It's clear, i wish it was a 18-200mm but it'll do for now. I can see us upgrading the lens as our baby gets older and does more group things like soccer.Must Have: A large SD card - we are using an 8GB and it doesn't seem like a large enough card.Don't Do: We took this on the beach - big mistake. I got sad between the screen protector and the screen - nicked the screen, and I have sand in weird nooks of the camera. We have a service plan which includes cleanings - so we will be using this.SNAGS: I don't know if I have a moody model or if this is a consistent problem. When I have it on \"Auto\" mode, the flash sometimes will not come on (when it's dark) so I have to take a picture in a well lit space and then try again. Sometimes I have to do this a few times for the picture to take. I will bring my camera in for service and figure it out.Quality: Pictures are amazing. It captures color/texture/looks/feel like nothing I could imagine a camera could do. Even the most mundane thing like my son drooling seem like a work of art. The best has been capturing a very colorful sunset. It showed the gradation colors of red to orange to yellow, the shadows, the texture of the sand. It's breathtaking.Would I recommend buying this: Yes/No.Yes if you want quality pictures and don't mind the price tag.Probably not if you're just point and click like I am. I don't regret buying this, but I think a more basic model would have served my needs until I was more knowledgable with DSLR. It seems like a huge splurge for a 1st time DSLR person. Or getting a less expensive body and shelling out for the lens that I really want.Do I regret getting this - I regret not buying a DSLR sooner. My son's birth pictures would have been better.The BIGGEST SURPRISE: We've been stopped by people on the street who tell us we have a nice camera or they have lens envy. I never would have guessed.

I currently have a Nikon D200, D70s, D40x and a whole bunch of Nikon Glass and Flashes, all of which are completely interchangeable with this new camera! I must say that I feel that Nikon has created a giant killer (the competition, especially for Canon). When you pick the unit up you will experience a well thought out and engineered product (you should always go to a brick and mortar store to try out a camera first for proper fit in hands, feel, aesthetics, etc.). Some people have complained that the D90 is too small for their hands. I am a really big guy who has big hands and though the unit is small in my hands, it is still comfortable to use and does not feel like a plastic throw-a-way like the Canons. I have added the MB-D80 Hand Grip to the D90 for additional surface area and better controls (plus additional battery capacity) and the unit feels just as good as my larger D200 which also has the MB-D200 Hand Grip for similar reasons.Regarding the D90's exceptional features, you will not go wrong here. The camera can serve both as a new bee unit for someone starting out or for a pro/enthusiast like myself with extremely fast shutter speeds, good 11 point focus area, and the real killer is the 720P HD Video capture capability...pure cream!

This camera is a little on the pricey side for a first DSLR, but you wont regret it a bit.  The images it produces are fantastic.  I really enjoy low light photography, and I have been able to grab some really nice shots have pretty high ISO's even without a tripod (it's not easy, but the camera goes a long way to make it work if you can just hold steady.)  The feature set is a bit overwhelming at first, but the great thing about the camera is that if you are coming from a point-n-shoot world, out of the box this camera has enough automation to make it possible to start taking good photos right away.  I picked up enough from the quick start manual to be able to put the lens on and go.  Everything is at your fingertips.  The controls are laid out great and the menus are easy to navigate.  This is my first Nikon and all the reviews I have read are true, Nikon puts together as much ease of use as they can into a very robust camera.The kit lens is what you would expect it to be.  It handles most basic shooting needs.  Again, this is my first DSLR, so it is perfect for general photography.  I have been able to get some really nice close up shots and it can pull in good to get some great action shots of my son playing soccer.  I have found, though, that I am going to need to start saving for a couple of additional specialty lens's to really do to telephoto and macro shots right, but if you are on a budget and/or need to grab just one lens to run with, the kit lens does a good enough job.The camera isn't too heavy and feels good in your hand.The liveview is pretty much worthless.  Not really the camera's fault, just the nature of what has to happen for liveview to work.  The focus lock is terribly slow, and the shutter lag is horrible.  That being said, it is a DSLR, and if you are looking to get into that arena, just having the liveview is a nice \"bonus\" on the occasion that you might need to get a shot on a tripod that is set up higher or lower than your eye level.  I give Nikon credit for including it.The icing on the cake is the ability to shoot HD video.  A still and separate video camera really are needed to take shots of any serious nature.  The right tool for the right job holds true.  BUT, it is nice to be able to flip it over to liveview and start recording.  When I am out taking stills, that's what I am doing, so the video camera stays home.  If something happens that just screams for motion, it does the job very sufficiently.  Again, don't toss your video equipment, and don't buy the camera based off of this feature.  It's a great camera on it's own, the video capabilities are just extra fun on the side.You can't go wrong with this rig.

The kit lenses are a great place to start and give you a wide range of uses. I picked up a few prime lenses(fixed focal length) and I was really amazed with the quality of pictures this camera produced.Video Quality: I have only used the video feature a few times and the quality I noticed from my limited use was good.Ease of Use: This camera had a small learning curve, after taking several hundred pictures I was able to really get the hang of how to use this camera. I was able to find several tricks to make my images better. I am far from a professional photographer, but I have had several years of experience with SLR cameras.

I also have a D70 I picked up used on ebay and I call it my trunk camera, always with me.  It now has almost 18000 clicks on it and both are going strong (had 1500 on it when I bought it 2 years ago).

As a matter of fact, I talked to Nikon customer service while in the store.  Nikon was VERY helpful.  They told me to disconnect my lens and put it back on. VOILA!!! My camera worked again.  I came to learn, through reading the manual, that this camera I had bought has a VR switch with the lens.  The manual says you MUST turn the VR switch on/off while the camera power is ON.  If you do not do this, you will have the problems mentioned throughout the negative reviews.

D90 may not have all the features which the others have in this comparison - Its video capture may not be as great as the Canon but the image quality is definitely better - Beyond a point pixels does not matter - 12.3 MP is still a very good image resolution - The built is not that great - may be  thats why the price appears to be catchy. If you are new to handling DSLRs, then pick this one. As far as the lenses are concerned, Nikkor is a pioneer in this category and there is lot of option to choose from. Canon 60D is costlier than D90. D7000 is costlier than 60D and 7D seems to be the most expensive one. If you are a Nikkon follower, you can grab this piece without any doubt. D7000 seems to be the best camera which has almost all the features which unfornutaley comes at a very price that did not fit my budget. For the lenses, to start with please grab a few from your friends and then test these which ones are suitable for your style of photography - If you wish to take pics only at parties, then 18-55mm should be sufficeint or else you can try for 18-105mm or a combination of 18-55 VR and 70-300mm telephoto.", "Date": "December 31, 2010"}, {"Title": "Love my D90--especially for truer color than the D80", "Author": "Perspicacious One \"J.T.\"", "ReviewID": "R3DHZL1PVBXWMU", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "The D90 has been reviewed many times on Amazon, and some of those reviews are highly detailed and lengthy and go into lots of the technical specifications.

While the high ISO quality is better than that of the D80 by a perceptible but not great margin, for me the most noticeable difference was truer color, particularly in mixed/difficult lighting conditions. It may be that in the intervening time, I've learned more of the nuances of tweaking white balance settings, but I truly do not think that that accounts for all of the difference. Even at times when I don't have time to fiddle and futz with using a custom setting, I just seem to get truer colors with the D90.

Class-leading low-light performance still after nearly two years. All the big camera manufacturers have their high-end showcases, Nikon included, but stick a good lens on this mid-range dSLR including the stock VR which is a great piece of engineering too and you'll get great pictures with a little practice and no fuss.I moved up to this when my D40 finally surrendered to constant abuse (the screen was squished on a trip to a wedding), and having picked up a few lenses already I was basically committed to Nikon. Not a bad thing really - SLR market competition is so fierce that at comparable price points you'll get a superlative machine whichever of the two big makers you choose, and if you are cheap like me you'll consider third-party lenses which tend to be identical between body brands anyway.I also considered the cheaper, lighter D5000 whose guts are almost identical, but having picked up both in a store to play with the first thing I noticed apart from the weight difference is that the viewfinder on the D90 is far, far better than the D5000's (pentaprism vs. pentamirror). The D5000 is less solidly built and looks rather toy-like and awkward with its swivel screen, which is also smaller and lower-resolution than the D90's but I'd count that as minor. Those and the D90's focus motor, not to be underestimated if you are planning to buy more lenses especially older second hand ones, are the only significant differences between the two as far as I can tell. If you have the same dilemma all I can suggest is you pick em both up too and see what feels right. The ~4oz lower weight of the D5000 might do it for you in the other direction.One little niggle which has come up in other reviews too (I recall reading this on dpreview for instance) is that the metering does seem to have a tendency to overexpose and blow out highlights. Once I'd noticed it damaging a few shots I started notching exposure compensation down a little by default - the sensor has ample sensitivity at the dark end for this not to do much harm the other way usually. In low light conditions I ramp it up again.My only real caveat right now in recommending this camera would be that Nikon are almost certain to introduce a replacement sometime this year based on their past release cadence, so it may pay to wait and see and enjoy whatever camera you have meantime; not necessarily to buy the new one but perhaps to await a price drop. Mid-range has always been Nikon's sweet spot and this camera will serve you well for years.

Not so any longer, the blues and greens produced by the D-90 are the best that I have ever seen with any camera and the subject pictures require very little if any final editing in terms of color appeal!

A fantastic leap from the point-and-shoot side of the fence! I had the camera for about 4 years, but really only started getting serious about photography a little over a year ago. After shooting with the D40 body and mastering it (the camera, not photography) over the course of a year, I was starting to hit imitations of the camera hardware and it was starting to look like it was time for an upgrade. I really prefer and like the Nikon camera bodies, so I knew I would be upgrading to a new Nikon. I studied all the bodies and reviews for months to find out what would be the best upgrade for me. It came down to the D90 and the D300.The two seemed to have pretty similar specs minus the video on the D90, although the D300 was touted as more of a \"professional\" camera. One of the biggest features I wanted was the command and sub-command dials for aperture and shutter speed adjustments.The video on the D90 leaves a little to be desired. Especially compared to the new D300s that came out a couple months after purchasing the D90. Video is not all that important to me, so it is just a bonus to be able to shoot little video clips with the same camera I already have with me.I find the build quality of the D90 to be much higher than some of the newer bodies coming out like the D3000. The body feels great in the hand and is a good weight. I like a larger camera body and this is just that. I found the D40 a little annoying to hold due to its small size. I had a battery grip on the D40 simply to make it more comfortable to hold with a longer lens.The image quality on the D90 is great. A very nice improvement from the D40, although the raw files were a lot harder to work with on my old laptop. The D40 raw files were no problem, but the D90 at twice the size made the computer chug. I have since upgraded to a new MacBook Pro, so it is no longer an issue.As far as lenses go with this new body, I bought the Nikon 35mm f/1.8. This lens is AMAZING! Super sharp and fast. And for only $200, you have to have this lens in your bag. I also rented the Nikon 18-200mm from [...] and I WILL be buying that lens at some point. It was so versatile and handled a full day shoot walking around town without having to stop and swap lenses.Overall, If you are in the market for a Nikon body upgrade from one of the lower tier bodies I would say this is definitely a camera to look at. If video is more important to you, you may want to look into the D300s instead. For me, stills are where I want to be, and this camera body does not disappoint!", "Date": "August 6, 2009"}, {"Title": "This D90 is like a member of our family", "Author": "A.

When I went to some photog's that I know, every one told me to get a Nikon (well, except for one Canon nut). I was told that a D40 would be a great beginners camera, but some of the things that I want to do, it would start to fail me once I got some good experience. The D80/D90 was what I wanted to get, unless I wanted to get the D300. I've been using and learning for a few months now, and I'm nothing short of impressed. I love this camera.First off, opening the box and taking the first few pictures is a breeze. And without looking at the manual, I was taking decent pictures. After reading through the manual, I started learning and the actual camera was pretty easy to pick up and learn on. Then I discovered all the editing functions on the camera. Sepia, B&W;, etc. These were nice little features to throw into this camera, and its great. (Not that I have used them, but perhaps one day). Well, I got a couple 16 GB SDHC cards a few weeks ago to go on a vacation to Kennedy Space Center. With the JPEG-high and RAW pictures, about an hour of video (off and on), I shot an amazing number of pictures, and the camera never let me down.

I currently have a Nikon D200, D70s, D40x and a whole bunch of Nikon Glass and Flashes, all of which are completely interchangeable with this new camera!  I must say that I feel that Nikon has created a giant killer (the competition, especially for Canon). When you pick the unit up you will experience a well thought out and engineered product (you should always go to a brick and mortar store to try out a camera first for proper fit in hands, feel, aesthetics, etc.).  Some people have complained that the D90 is too small for their hands.  I am a really big guy who has big hands and though the unit is small in my hands, it is still comfortable to use and does not feel like a plastic throw-a-way like the Canons.  I have added the MB-D80 Hand Grip to the D90 for additional surface area and better controls (plus additional battery capacity) and the unit feels just as good as my larger D200 which also has the MB-D200 Hand Grip for similar reasons.Regarding the D90's exceptional features, you will not go wrong here.  The camera can serve both as a new bee unit for someone starting out or for a pro/enthusiast like myself with extremely fast shutter speeds, good 11 point focus area, and the real killer is the 720P HD Video capture capability...pure cream!  I am sure glad I did not spend the extra money on the D300 as the reviews of the D90 are just as good as if not better than the D300...all for a camera costing a good $900.00 less!All-in-all, a very good investment here for anyone wanting a very excellent, fast, and fun DSLR!", "Date": "January 6, 2009"}, {"Title": "Same issues with \"F--\" error and poor autofocus", "Author": "Kevin M.

I wanted an entry level camera at the same time will give me that room for me improve as i grow my photography skills. I narrowed my choice between Canon 50D and Nikon D90. Knowing that both are almost match with the 50D better on the spec sheet i went to a local camera shop and decide which one feels better in my hands. Being a Canon shooter it was hard for me to even look and try the Nikon but when i got my hands on the D90 everything changed. It felt better, not too big nor small, not too heavy or light and plasticy feel and it just feels better in my hands than the bulkier 50D. I really liked the control layout better, and the quick info button that i eventually remapped to my quick menu which enables me to change AF modes quickly and easily. The pictures are just amazing and i could switch between different picture controls i've set for people (nice skin tones) and to things (saturated, popping colors). The 4.3 fps or so speed is just perfect to capture my 1year old son and the 18-105 kit lens was just perfect zoom range for my needs. Again not too heavy. I also have 70-300VR lens for some telephoto shots. I've had my D90 now for almost 3 months and the new D5000 and Canon T1i that have come out and if i would have to redo it again i'd still go with the D90.

I hesitate, because it is all relative and the assumption has to made either you know what you are doing when you pick this thing as you photographic weapon of choice or your cerebral cortex is wired like Deep Blue - \"...challenge/smallenge, I read books on biochemistry on my lunch break and I am an accountant\".Do not buy this camera unless you are ready to take for real photographs or you like fancy expensive paper weights.  There is no sense in buying this behemoth or reading 200+ reviews if you just want to snap quick pictures.  Buy yourself a fancy point and shoot like the Nikon Coolpix S8000 (No, I am not a Nikon employee, but I am brand loyal like NASCAR fans...Canon sucks*!) and keep it moving.  This camera is a hassle to lug around, take out, hang around your neck, keep wandering hands off of, insure you aren't banging it against walls/rocks/heads/etc...unless of course you like taking pictures and understand you don't perform heart surgery with a butter knife, Mag-Lite and degree from ITT Tech.My assumption going forward in this review is you know as much about photography as I did when I bought this thing; if you know more you probably don't need to read my ramblings.Before you can reasonably use the camera you will need to buy a memory card.  I spent $90 on a 16GB card.  The guy at the camera shop says the one I bought is faster and better suited for photography.  Of course I might have been the sucker he needed to make his nut for the day, but I have had no problem with the card so far and since I bought this camera in September I have taken over 10,000 photos and repeated uploaded and deleted.  But you MUST have a memory card because the camera does not come with one.Out of the box, I bought with the kit, this thing should have come with a soundtrack (a la Disney's Lion King) and bright lights (briefcase in Pulp Fiction).  The first thing I did was charge the battery.  Then I started to read the novel known as a Users Guide on how to just take a picture; the thing is the \"War and Peace\" of manuals.  Once the battery charged I formatted the memory card, went through the numerous pre-camera shooting settings (it was like preflight before a shuttle launch it took so long) and attached what has become my trusty-dusty 18 - 105 mm.After maybe 2,000/3,000 photos I started to get an error message.  You would think for the amount of coin you shell out for this device there would be no issues.  Because I only had one lens and consequently did not take it off at all, the contacts between the camera and the lens never \"settled\" (kind of like the good old days as a kid when you would have to smack the TV to get the picture to clear up).  So after calling the help desk, in CA, not India, I was told I would have to keep removing and reattaching the lens.  I did as prescribed and the problem went away.  Please note I was so scared I went ahead and dropped the $150 (I think) on the extended service plan - coincidence, hmmmmm.  I have not had the problem since; but you do have to keep your contacts on the camera and the lens clean.The software to transfer the pictures is pretty easy to use (I am in IT, so if the most technical thing in your life is toaster, you may need some help).The more you use the camera and buy stuff for it (I have bought 2 more lens (70 - 300mm 4.5 & 50mm 1.8)- 2 more in the works, a battery pack, an extra battery, a SB-900 flash, a tripod (just go ahead an buy one you will need it) and a backpack) the more you will learn about its great powers.  I have had it for almost a year, over 10,000 photos deep and I am still learning.  I do not regret this purchase at all!  Join in the church of NIKON, the Kool Aid is fine, no really, I drink it all the time.I recommend this camera to everyone who asks who meet my similar criteria...you are a hobbyist, but will take payment for photos; you have a good eye - learn on a cheaper camera if your \"eye\" has cataracts; and you understand this hobby - much like Fame - costs.* I have no bases with which to judge Canon.  Some of my closes friends have a Canon (they only mildly suck).  Canon sucks simply because it is not NIKON.  If I owned a Canon, perish the thought, NIKON would suck.

I was starting from scratch was upgrading to an SLR for the speed, indoor/low light shooting options, and an improved external flash.I was torn between the Canon XSI, T1i, the Nikon D200 and the D90. I wanted the body to be less than $1000.The D200 is the grandpa camera to the D90 and passes on many features: the Pentaprism viewfinder, Multi-CAM1000 AF system, wireless flash operation, EN-EL3e battery, basic menu system and awsome Nikon build quality. Most of these features are enhanced for the D90, especially the CMOS censor (instead of CCD), color depth, movie mode, battery life, higher res screen, controls, high ISO performance and censor dust removal (to name a few). I was considering the D200 because of the weather seals, magnesium alloy body and the price on a recent BBY sale, $600 w/free shipping.Rebel XSI is a great value right now with live view good overall performance. The T1i has a higher res screen, digic 4 processing, movie mode and a few other features. Both have almost all the features that someone entering the DSLR field will be looking for. I would say the smart auto/preset modes really make these cameras easy to take good pictures.I really wanted 2 things in my new SLR, built in wireless flash commander for creative lighting of portraits with minimal extra equipment (like extra strobes, portable lights, etc), and the overall \"feel\" of the camera. If you handle the D90 and any Rebel, you will find there is an obvious feel difference. It is mostly weight, but also the feel of the plastic used is very different. Those interested in manual controls will like the D90/40D/50D/D200. There is nothing I can say \"bad\" about the Rebel series because the lighter weight will mean less fatigue if carrying the camera for an extended period of time. If this is important go to dpreview.com and compare the cameras you are interested in side-by-side and see the weight difference. After carrying the  D90 around, I can say it is something you have to want to carry.Those familiar with these cameras will be quick to point out that the better comparison would be the Canon 40D/50D. However, I found the D90 for $700 body only and hence are unfairly comparing the \"entry\" level Rebel series to the Nikon D90. Price was important for my decision, so I went with the most camera for the buck, and I found that to be the D90.Compared to the 40D/50D the superior weather seals on the Canons and megapixel advantage on the 50D make it quite a good deal. If you have the money for the 40D/50D, then there is no blatant reason to get the D90 over the 40/50D besides needing an $200+ accessory for wireless flash, or the purchase of the 580EX flash. If the 40D had this built in, I probably would have that camera.More of my friends have a Canon than Nikon, so if lens sharing is a factor, then go with what your friends/family have. Also, if on a budget, be sure to save for quality lenses, flashes, and filters. An important point to remember is that your eye for composition will be the #1 instrument at your disposal.Many of the features showing up on modern DSLR cameras can be performed in photoshop or other software, like distortion correction, active D-lighting, color balancing, and adding a flash after the picture was taken. In camera abilities are simply a choice and for some, a preference.

The 18-105 kit lens - I had heard from several people that the kit lens are useless and you should throw them. but i can tell now that this ket lens is no pushover. If you go to Nikon's website, it's one of the regular lenses they sell, so why should the quality be doubted. anyway, we can put to rest to that.3. White balance using grey card - I am not a tech geek, so was nervous about being able to use the \"PRE\" setting. but it's so easy to use and makes a huge impact on the photographs i took..!4. Autofocus motor - I bought a cheaper non autofocus 50 mm prime lens (if I am ot mistaken, these are cheaper than if u need to have the autofocus motor in the lens) and can use the camera'a autofocus motor to use AF...saves some money i guess.One thing which may be improved - Photography lessons talk about rule of third. for that you need to visualize 2 vertcial and horizintal lines going through the viewfinder. D90 has three lines going through it's viewfinder. Why can't they keep only 2 lines which makes it easier for novice like us to use the rule of third easily...maybe they have some other use of 3 lines..", "Date": "March 7, 2012"}, {"Title": "Nikon's Autofocus and the DX family of lenses have blown me away!", "Author": "Jason C.

After a year, I bought the E500, then an E-3, then added an E-520 as a back-up body.  Last week, I ordered the D90 after I decided that Olympus appears not to be dedicated to the serious photographer.I love this camera! After receiving my new Tamron 18-270mm lens (look for my review) yesterday, I called up a buddy that has been using the D90 for a year and we went out shooting. He flattened my learning curve quite a bit by pointing out features he knew I'd be using.My favorites:The exposure bracketing button is well placed and makes it simple and fast to move into a bracketing mode as I often do when a scene lends itself to HDR processing.The +/- exposure button is also quick and easy. And speaking of exposure...the metering modes are also easy to change and all do their job remarkably well.The ease of moving the focal point around the viewfinder is a super feature that is quite valuable to me as I am a devotee of the \"rule of thirds.\"The dual adjustment wheels is a feature I am use to with the E-3 and I'm glad I didn't have to give that up.As today is the first day I had the camera in the field, I have much more to learn about its capabilities, but as for right now, I quite pleased with the D90 and the super price I got from Upbeat Electronics. I'll be posting some images on my website [...] soon.One last thing...I gave myself a budget of $1500 to switch to a new camera system. I thought long and hard about the D300s or even the D7000. But, I finally came to the conclusion that I would be better served with a more economical camera body which would leave me more dollars for some good glass. As I mentioned earlier, I purchased the Tamron 18-270mm zoom. With the current rebate on this lens, I got it for well under $500!

That leaves you with about $125 to put towards another lens.I bought a 55-200 VR as well... although not as nice as some of the 70-300 lenses, I have had no regrets from my purchase.Some other recommendations would be the discontinued 24-85 f/3.5-4.5 AF-S G for an all in one lens or the more expensive 16-85 AF-S G if you need a wider lens.  They can be found used for around $450 if you look in the right places and produce better images than the kit lens.", "Date": "November 1, 2010"}, {"Title": "Great mid range camera", "Author": "RTM", "ReviewID": "R3DVNT56CCXMQ4", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I've been using this camera for about 2 months now and I've been extremely happy with it so far.  I traded up from a Sony DSLR-A230 and I've never once considered looking back.  I'm not a professional photographer and I'm not loaded (lowly government employee) and I have no buyer's remorse in spending this amount of money on a camera.  None whatsoever.  Understandably it's going to be better than the Sony because it's a mid-range rather than an entry level, but it's astonishingly better.Camera body: Very solid and feels great in your hand.  I don't have huge or small hands, and it feels just about right for me.  Buttons are laid out properly and all within fingers reach without stretching.  Aperture and shutter speed dials spin with just the right amount of resistance.  Buttons have a firm press and an obvious detent for when they're activated.  LCD display on top is great; it's customizable to what exactly you want it to display.Lens: I own the kit 18-105 lens (bought the body on sale and then the kit lens on eBay for $200 refurb... saved a little cash) and a 50mm F1.8 lens.  VR works fairly well and will allow you to (give or take) shoot about 3 stops slower than you could normally hand hold.  I can hand hold around 1/15 without too much blur.  You can definitely hear it kicking in and DEFINITELY see it in the viewfinder.  Kind of looks like you're drunk (the motions are slightly delayed and slowed).  Picture quality with the kit lens is also fairly good but with a moderate amount of linear distortion at the extremes, most notably around 18mm.  It's still somewhat correctable with post-processing, but it's worth noting.  Around 24mm is where I've noticed the least distortion.  Since it's an AF-S lens (meaning the focusing is done by a motor within the lens rather than the screw drive), autofocus is VERY quick.  Much better than my 50mm lens that uses the screw drive.Rear LCD screen: Great great great.  Extremely high resolution, to the tune of almost 4 times the pixels of the D80.  More pixels means more accurate post-shot analysis.  To relate, those of you who have upgraded from an iPhone 3G/3GS to the new iPhone 4, that's pretty close to the same difference in clarity on the screen.  It's simply amazing.User interface: Very well laid out.  Customizable menus as well as recently used items, quite handy.  Nice little \"help\" button when scrolling through menus that you hold down and it explains what the item you've selected changes, great for beginners or new Nikon users.  The GUI is setup the same as a D300S rather than the lower range cameras, so it's starting to err on the upper end of things rather than lower.Picture quality: Very good.  It's highly dependent upon the lens you put on it and the focusing quality, though.  The additional megapixels have a way of really highlighting any blurriness.. so I suppose it's a blessing and a curse.  12.3 is nothing compared to the ridiculous 18 you get on a Canon T2i though; it's getting to be ridiculous.  The great thing about the D90 and the rest of the mid range and higher Nikons is that the lens selection is enormous.  The ability to use regular AF (non AF-S) lenses is a huge advantage over the lower range models and something to really consider.  As noted above, exposures at the extremes with the kit lens will have a fair amount of distortion.Altogether a great camera.  It'll leave you plenty of room to grow if you're just starting out, unlike some other options out there.  It's still advanced enough to be used by \"power users\" though, but it's not a pro camera.", "Date": "October 7, 2010"}, {"Title": "I love this camera.", "Author": "craz3z \"craz3z\"", "ReviewID": "RR3QCT5O7LZ72", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I started out learning about photography on a Nikon D40, and was ready for an upgrade so I chose the Nikon D90.

However, I wanted a more capable camera and bought a D90. The first thing I noticed was that in the PhotoShop raw image processing dialog, I almost always used the color temp and exposure settings selected by the D90 on auto. This was quite a change from the D40x where I usually needed to correct basic settings. Another plus was that I could shoot with 800-1600 ASA without serious grain. (I use in-camera noise reduction for high ASA.) This means that I can take most indoor shots without flash especially with VR (vibration reducing) lenses. I also have a Nikon 85mm micro lens and am able to shoot most pictures without a tripod given the possible use of high ASA and VR. In general the D90 does the right thing and I feel comfortable leaving many of the settings on auto. I normally shoot in \"P\" mode where I can twist a dial to change aperture/shutter speed together and I manually control ASA. Most exposures are done in raw and I use a 16 bit/channel PhotoShop process to prepare and print, typically, to 13\"x19\" paper. I find that the D90 and DX Nikon lenses are more than adequate for this sized printing.

I bought many optics for them as well as many accessories (ext tubes etc.). I wanted a dslr that I could use many, if not all, of the accessories I already had. The D90 fills the bill. The camera came with the 18-105 lens. All my photos are sharp and clear. If any are blurry it's my fault not the camera's or the lens fault. I ordered a 8 gig transcend sd card with the camera and have not had any issues with it. Later I saw a Lexar 4 gig sd card on sale and it has worked well also. I haven't tried the high speed sd cards yet. Maybe later. These work and work well so why spend more money?  After reading many of the reviews, I must admit, I was a little fearful that I would have problems. So far nothing. No error messages, no nothing. It works and keeps on working. In cold weather and not so cold ( I live in so cal and have shot in the snow in the mountains and in the 80's in my back yard, yes and it's not summer yet). The camera has a learning curve. It has many options and it takes a while to learn how to use them. It can be used as a point and shot camera but only if you set it up that way. Learn to use it and use it correctly and it can be a valuable tool. I'm still learning. As far as the lens goes I have no complaints. It's sharp (for my purposes)and as far as the plastic lens mount is concerned, no worries. I'm not a pro. I use my camera maybe 5 or 6 times a week. 95% of the time I leave the lens on. The range of the lens is the one used for most of my pictures (family, vacation etc). I have a 600mm mirror, a 105mm nikor that I use sometimes. These lenses are the ones for my 35mm Nikons. They work on the D90 in manual mode. So I'm not changing the lens every 5 minutes. I don't think the plastic lens mount will be a factor.  This camera isn't cheap. I works well and I'm happy with it.

Kato \"MK\"", "ReviewID": "RM9HJBVF8XW56", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "The photos I took in 2005 of my first son's graduation from college were a bit blurry.  I used a Panasonic Lumix DMC-FZ20 camera with an f2.8 36-432mm (35mm equivalent) lens, but that camera has a maximum ISO setting of 400.  The FZ20's photo information indicated that the shutter speeds for the blurry photos were slow -- 1/8 and 1/15 -- too slow for the 400mm zoom lens setting and moving subjects.  My second son was going to graduate from that same college and the ceremony was going to be an evening ceremony and at the same poorly lighted location (I believe that, after paying for four years of college, parents should be entitled to having the graduation ceremony in a well-lighted location and close enough access to take photos of their children during the ceremony without fast, heavy telephoto lenses, but, apparently, my belief is not shared by those in positions to do something about it).  So I concluded that I needed a camera with a bigger image sensor that had better low-light, high-ISO performance.  The full-size sensor digital SLRs were too expensive for me, so I checked on the cameras with smaller sensors.  After reviewing camera reviews of various SLRs on low-light, high-ISO performance, I concluded that my choices were limited to Canon or Nikon digital SLRs with the APS-C sensors.  I have Canon PowerShot compact digital cameras that I really like, so I was leaning towards a Canon Rebel SLR.  However, when I went to stores and actually handled the cameras, the grips of the bigger Canon SLRs (which were, unfortunately, too heavy and too expensive for me) and of the Nikon SLRs just seemed to be more comfortable to me than the smaller Rebel models (although I liked the lighter weight of the Rebel models compared to the bigger SLRs).Another difference that I noticed was that the Canon SLRs required the pop-up flash to be activated to provide low-light focus assistance, whereas the Nikon SLRs had a focus-assist light on the body of the camera itself.  Because I usually have an external flash in the flash shoe in low-light situations, but I was not sure which flash I would eventually be using (I was thinking of using one of my older flashes that would not have the connection to the cameras for all of the flash features), I thought that the focus-assist light on the body of the camera was preferable.  When the Nikon D90 was announced, it seemed to have the features that I wanted, such as a good prism viewfinder and LCD panel, and be close to the size and price I could seriously consider.  Because my compact digital cameras could all take short video clips (I have used those cameras for short videos of my sons playing Nintendo Wii drums, my grandchildren playing, Christmas decoration lights, fireworks, and the Old Faithful Geyser erupting, but I am basically a still photographer, not a videographer), I thought that an SLR that could also take videos would be handy to have.  But, of course, the goal was to get the best low-light, high-ISO performance for the money, so I waited for some reviews to come out.  I had been regularly checking the reviews at the Digital Camera Resource Page and the posted examples of photos at high-ISO settings.  After I read in September 2008 the Digital Camera Resource Page review of the Nikon D90, I pretty much made up my mind that the Nikon D90 was the digital SLR I was going to get.  I also decided to get the 18-105mm kit lens, because the reviews seemed to indicate that it was fairly good across its range and the lens's focal-length range came closer to the coverage of my Canon PowerShot cameras than did the smaller 18-55mm kit lens.  However, with Christmas expenses coming up, I had to wait to order one, so I just put the Nikon D90 with the kit lens in my Amazon.com cart and monitored the price.Because I needed time to familiarize myself with the D90 before my son's graduation scheduled for May 2009, I ordered the D90 with the 18-105mm kit lens (with free Super Saver Shipping) in January 2009.  There are a lot of settings that could be made, so I reviewed the detailed suggestions made by Ken Rockwell and set what I thought would be correct for my photography.  In March 2009, I purchased a Tamron AF 70-200mm f2.8 Di LD IF Macro Lens for use during the graduation ceremony scheduled in May 2009.  During the graduation ceremony, with my D90 set at ISOs of 3200 and 4000 and at shutter speeds of about 1/500 and with the Tamron lens at f2.8 and at the equivalent of 300mm on my D90, I was able to get the photos I wanted.  I later switched to the 18-105mm lens and put on a Nikon SB-600 flash (I ultimately decided to get a new flash to go with the D90 rather than try to use one of my old flashes) to take the post-ceremony photos (at ISO 200) of my son with family and friends.Since then, the Nikon D90 with the 18-105mm lens and the SB-600 flash has become my main equipment for bigger office and family events (I still carry and use my Canon PowerShots for many photos, because the D90 is not my everyday carry camera).  I have the Nikon active D-lighting on to record things in shadows, but I have noticed that some photos have the highlights blown.  I have used the Camera Raw option to open JPEGs in Adobe Photoshop Elements 6 to reduce exposure and to recover some detail in the highlights.  To reduce the overexposure of highlights, I set the compensation reduction to -.3, figuring that I can always lighten and brighten what is recorded, if needed, but I would not be able to do anything about blown highlights if the highlight detail is not there.  Most of my photos have been taken indoors with the flash and I have set the Auto ISO setting with top of ISO 3200, which has produced some unexpected photos (of what was in the background of what I focused on).  Because the D90 is my first digital SLR, I have been enjoying the speed of a digital SLR when I am trying to photograph fleeting expressions of my grandchildren and other things that require fast repeat shots -- my PowerShots are slow in comparison, so one problem has been that when I use my PowerShots instead of my D90, I am sometimes pressing the shutter button on my PowerShots when the cameras are not yet ready to take another photo.  After taking over 3,800 photos so far, I have not had any problem with the D90.  It served the purpose for which I originally bought it and it has served me well since then in photographing office and family parties and other events.  People seem to be favorably impressed with the photos taken with the D90, so I am very happy with my decision to buy it.", "Date": "April 8, 2010"}, {"Title": "Nicest for the money", "Author": "Paul Christensen", "ReviewID": "R2879AI3IBLHW1", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I purchased the Nikon D90 body only because I already had many lenses from previous Nikon cameras.Having shot not an extreme amount of pictures,I would, by what I have seen from the exposures, rate it amongst the top of the line.

I see many poor photographs trying to be sold and they think owning and using a nice camera makes them good.  It is in the eye.  If you do not have the eye, develop it.  No amount of equipment will make you good.  It may help but that is the extent of it.  I would have liked to have known what dx means.  It means that it is not a true 35mm format camera.  This means that the old 35mm lens focal length have to be adjusted by multiplying by a factor of 1.5.  This by no means takes away from the quality of the camera but would have been nice to know.  To get a true 35mm format camera you have to buy the 300, 700, D3 or above.  This increase in focal length can actually work to ones advantage because a 200mm lens is now 300mm lens but a 28mm lens is now a 42mm lens so to get a true 28mm you have to purchase an 18mm (which is really a 27mm)lens.It is like owning a camera, a photo lab, a computer, cellphone (whoops no telephone here) all in one.

The screen is big, bright & colorful.  There are a ridiculous number of custom settings for almost every function, which means you can do a lot to configure the camera to the way you like to shoot.  There are a lot of buttons & two wheels--almost too many controls--but with a little practice you can access almost any function you're likely to need in the act of shooting without menu-diving.  I also do a lot of flash photography, and the highly-variable ISO control in conjunction with the ease of tweaking the white balance means a lot less time fixing color in Lightroom or photoshop.It also has Live View--but I'm not so crazy about that function.  The autofocus in LV is slow, and taking a shot is noisy one loud click when the mirror gets out of the way, then the shutter, then the mirror jumping out of the way again (I think...).  One other niggle: the multi-point autofocus doesn't work so well in low-contrast situations--ever since I changed it to the center point, I've never had a focus problem. I haven't shot any moving subjects yet, which is what it's designed for. I also haven't used the video function--newer cameras have much better implementation of this feature.

The kind of shooting I do suits the kit lens although I am able to use several of my older manual focus (Al)lenses. I do plan to get some faster single glass for portraits in low natural lightThis machine takes photos in places so dark that I can barely see the subject and using raw files allows for infinite adjustment of the pix.

The sensor developed hot pixels within the first 3 months. You need to send the camera to Nikon for remap or use software to remap. Some competitors are already doing that in-camera...- Supports from Nikon is lacking. Come on, still no firmware update?- Useless video (doesn't bother me at all)- Longing for more focus points- Not as good jpeg output as Canon.

It's smaller, lighter and CHEAPER. Consider purchasing a nice Nikon speedlight to compliment this camera after having saved $400 not getting the D300. In addition, a battery grip adds to the pro feel and look of this camera while making it take 3x more pictures on 1 charge so I'd also advise you to purchase one (check out the Opteka Battery Grip for the D89/D90 - it comes with 2 extra batteries and is cheaper than the Nikon brand, they work the same way!)The lens this camera comes with (18-105mm) is nice and you'll get good use out of it. Very good range, clean photos, just be careful not to bang it around too much the lens mount is plastic afterall.I'm not saying that the D300 isn't a sweet camera and if you can afford it, get it - you'll be happier in the end knowing you got something more expensive than your friend next door.

In a flash (no pun intended) you can change the light output of your flash units and keep right on shooting. If you are planning on using flash, this is a great camera. The built in flash acts as a commander so you do not have to add an additional flash to the hot shoe for control.

Nikon has done themselves proud with a camera that is now in a market that is full of tough competition. A while ago when the D80 first came out Nikon was way ahead of the pack because there wasn't much competition. Things have changed signifigantly and Nikon has kept pace with the demand. The camera has several preprogrammed \"scene\" modes like most digital cameras, such as \"Portrait\", \"Landscape\", \"Micro\", \"Sports\" and \"Night\" There isn't anything unusual about the modes of course, it's the quality of the image that you get from each of those modes that dazzles. The camera has a multitude of features including custom programming modes so you can adjust the camera to take a particular scene the way YOU want instead of the way the manufacturer wants.The camera is built very well, solid and it feels great in your hands. It's the kind of camera you can take with you to a football game and not worry about someone damaging it with a slight bump. It comes in body only or with several \"kit\" lenses. The most common being the 18-105mm Zoom lens with Vibration Reduction. The lens is of good quality although you could buy a better one by avoiding the kit lens.The camera is a bit overpriced. Not outrageously so but Nikon could have shaved a few dollars off.The bottom line is the D90 even with a slightly inflated price is an excellent camera that takes quality images even under the most demanding conditions. If you are inexperienced at photography but want a quality camera set the D90 to \"auto\" and point and shoot. The camera will do the work and the images will be consistantly perfect. Once you have built up some experience you can program the camera to set your mood.As for \"Cons\" I have just one. It has a movie mode with 24 FPS (frames per second). The movie mode is not very good if that's an important feature to you. When panning you get \"shutter lag\" which causes image attributes such as straight lines (the sides of a building for example) to get \"skewed.\" If you are using it for occasional movies and avoid action scenes you won't mind but football games are out. The D90 was the first DSLR to have movie mode so I suppose one can excuse Nikon as they were the first on the block to try it. Of course you don't buy a DSLR for movies so it's kind of a \"white elephant\" Take it as a nice feature to play with but your camera is for taking photographs not movies.I can't recommend this camera enough.

I am still learning the capabilities of this camera and am suprised every time I discover something new.The body is well built and has a great feel in the hand. The in-camera focus motor is quiet on my non G lenses. ISOs above 800 are very usable with low noise. Coming from the D50, the viewfinder is bright and bigger. Buttons are positioned well and reachable. LCD is ultra sharp and huge. The video is not quite there yet but I did not get this body for the video. I wanted the CMOS sensor EXPEED. However, done just right, no quick movements, tripod use and a steady zoom hand, you can make some nice clips. I did find Windows Media Player has problems with the Nikon Codec. It is jerky and stumbles on playback. Just use another player like Quicktime or VLC Player.Battery life is definately shorter on this body compared to the D50, but VR on the 18-105 adds to the battery drain.I am glad I skipped the D80. This is not a classic Nikon, \"add and X or S to it\", update. It is a full blown new release. I would reccomend this body to anyone looking for affordable Gen II color.For me the big selling point was the built in AF motor. I have older D lenses that will not AF on the D5000, D40, and D60 and I did not want to replace them with G lenses.Overall, solid body, built like a tank compared to the D50, very ergonomic and fast at most everything it does.

And for the obligatory shot of you and your family in front of the Taj Mahal, the green \"auto-everything\" mode is a virtual guarantee that even that prosthetic device salesman from Cleveland that you're entrusting with this irreplaceable photo will get it right.I bought it primarily for traveling, but as mentioned, it turns out to be my preference in lots of other situations too.

I use Photoshop for digital darkroom post-processing, so I tend to shy away from some of the options and functions that I can achieve afterwards(the D90 allows effects simulating many filters, color and monochrome effects, cropping, tweaking, etc.). The D90 was the right choice for me in wanting to continue to use my AF Nikon lenses, as lower end digital Nikons will work with those lenses, but not in auto-focus mode, and any digital Nikon further up the product line jumps in price considerably out of my present budget. I didn't want to purchase new lenses at this time, and so far am very pleased with the results I've been achieving. It's now a no-brainer to bracket a shot with no worries about how many frames I'm wasting to get the perfect shot. I used to be pleased with one or two perfect shots from a roll, knowing that 34 shots (at film/processing costs) go in the \"outtakes\" file, while now it's just as simple as erasing the unwanted photographs and continue shooting. If you shoot 40+ rolls of Velvia, for example, you quickly add up the cost to what it takes to move onto digital. I'm not abandoning film, but now I can shoot much more, and much more often to improve my skills, which is the whole idea, isn't it? ;)", "Date": "July 9, 2010"}, {"Title": "My one and last camera!", "Author": "Marx Lives", "ReviewID": "ROYQ4OIY14EBQ", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I am a serious amateur photographer. My last two cameras were already advanced compact cameras. The D90 is the first low-end professional SLR with exchangable lenses that I own. I bought the D90 along with a combination of Nikon lenses and a Nikon flash. But I want to concentrate in the camera: The D90 is smaller than the real professional ones but larger and heavier than any advanced compact. You get used to its weight tough, meaning, it is not unbearable. Take this from a 5'4\" woman.  Despite the additional weight, I like the camera's solid feeling. Although it delivers and it delivers well, buyers should know that it is a VERY complex little light-image computer in your hands. The menus are easy to work with and to remember; they are very logical. But there are plenty menus. I am still learning them as I learn more about digital photography in the classes I am taking. I use the Liveview but not as much as other people like to use it. The only thing I do miss is the flip off viewer of my compact cameras. I like to take pictures of my pets from the ground, and without a flip off viewer you cannot do this without laying on the groud yourself.I only buy lenses and flashes from Nikon because the camera works great with its own equipment. I have the 18-200 lens and I could not be happier with the results I get.If you are serious about moving to a bit higher level in your photography skills, this is a great camera and it could very well be the only camera you need. Cameras and lenses are expensive, so enthusiast photographers like me should pick carefully the items that actually need according to their skill level.

It's the best camera I've ever had, and I've had Nikons, Sonys, Kodaks, Polaroids, and even a no-name half-frame camera that produced excellent Kodachrome slides--twice as many per roll as a regular 35mm camera.Still, when the media compartment cover popped open in the camera bag, and I pulled out the camera using the camera strap, I snapped the cover in two.  Less than two weeks old, and Nikon's warranty didn't cover \"abuse and misuse,\" according to their tech support, and besides there were no \"user-serviceable parts\" so they didn't want to sell me a replacement.  They wanted me to send it to them for repair (at my cost).Well, I ordered an OEM replacement online for about $12 and have had it for a while, but thought the two strips of Magic Mending tape that hold the two broken pieces in place were a badge, so I haven't gotten around to unscrewing two tiny Phillips screws (after all, they're not user-serviceable).  Besides, with a 16 GB media card installed, I won't need to open the media compartment for a while even though I shoot mostly RAW+JPEG images that take up a lot of space.I do not understand how Nikon's solid camera, which can even control an off-the-camera slave flash WIRELESSLY, can be fitted with such fragile covers for the battery and media compartments.  Perhaps they should study the Sony DSC-R1 that I have, to see how sturdiness looks.The body I bought from Amazon, by the way, is warranted in the USA by Nikon (except for misuse and abuse) and was cheaper than other sources I looked at, even including the sales tax I have to pay as a resident of the state of Washington.

It's just like it's older brother, the D300, but in a different body. This review is targeted mainly to birders, but any photographer will enjoy this camera. I have been photographing birds with this platform for about half a year now. It was a huge step up from my older Nikon D70, but if you practice a little with this camera, the better results will start flowing in. It has a nice FPS speed for those flying birds, and is great for birders who need a mid-range camera that WILL GET THE JOB DONE under any light condition and at any time. Whats cool is that the user can control the sharpness, saturation, and hue of the image, saving some time from editing later. Also for birders, I reccomend the MB-D80 Battery Grip (yes, it's another hundred dollars, but it will ensure that you get more time taking photos and less time charging batteries). For those who don't know, a Battery Grip is an extension that fits into the battery compartment of the camera, holding two EN-EL3E batteries. It's also important to buy Nikon brand  battery grips, and batteries also. I've heard many complaints regarding the life of the 3rd party battery grips and batteries. My birding setup includes a D90 with Battery grip, an all important monopod (for the larger lenses), and a tamron 200-400mm tele. Many people also have older f-mount lenses that may not function as well on other nikon cameras. The Nikon D90 can function any f-mount lens, brand name or not, and can hit super fast auto focus speeds in most lighting, also good for moving birds. This is due to the D90's internal auto focus capabilities, giving AF to any lens.It is great with a 200-400mm, and 500mm lenses, which I recommend for bird photography. So, find a good price for the camera. I got mine off Amazon for $500 dollars off, and you can also.

Till I had a freelance graphics job that paid for this camera. I have played with some of the 5100s and 3100s and although they are fine cameras, they make it hard to change the basic settings for your camera (ISO especially.) This is one place the 90 shines - if you want to change a basic setting on the fly, you can do it without ever taking your eyes from the viewfinder. For me this means less interruptions and more agility.These are things that are very good when photographing moving scenes or different people scenes but not really needed for landscape photos. With landscapes you can set your hard to set settings once, and change everything else as needed. You really are paying for convenience and not image quality on the D90.Image quality (ISO based): at ISO 400 or less the image noise is wow level, 800 so so, anything more than 800 and it's &^%$: BUT I also despise noise and will trade loss of sharpness for lack of noise any day. The built in flash is good for emergency use but without handmade adjusters (to blur the light) it's way too close to the center line to give nice soft light pictures. I sometimes wrap a sheet of thin paper in a circle around the flash to soften it or even a piece of wax paper to increase the degree of diffuse. With a really heavy piece of material you can almost get a snoot effect.Batteries last a good long time, over 200 shots before I even noticed changes in the battery display, BUT I don't do 'auto-review' on the rear screen. The camera fits my hands pretty well, it's a little small for me but I have big clublike hands so you may not find it so small.I wish Nikon added an internal cover for changing the lenses (slide a lever it covers the lens hole, remove the lens, add another, pull the slide back) to reduce dust getting in, but this isn't top of the line so don't expect every gee whiz feature. I chose to get a body only and pick the lenses I wanted, but I had that experience with my film SLRs and didn't want to give it up. The package including 55-200 G VR lenses are probably best, add the 18-55 for crowd shots and go prime if you are in low light situations.Bottom line, if you know what you are doing, the D90 is a great camera, especially for portrait and fast moving subjects, just realize you are paying for those extra buttons, not better image,", "Date": "September 27, 2011"}, {"Title": "Fantastic camera!", "Author": "Maria", "ReviewID": "RZJJ5NOOCN5MC", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This is my first DSLR camera, but I love it!

Instead, I will tell you why I bought it and my impressions after 1 1/2 years of use.I bought this camera as my introduction into the world of DSLR photography. I had fancied myself a decent pic taker with a regular point & shoot for years, but wanted to actually start taking \"photographs\".Well, during thousands of photos and multiple cross- and intercontinental trips, this camera has become my constant companion. I've found the build quality to be excellent. The kit lens I purchased (18-105mm f/3.5) was one of the reasons I chose the D90 and it hasn't disappointed. The only limitation I've found with this has been in low light situations, as I take pictures of kids or at family parties, etc. Certainly not a knock on the camera, but I've invested in a faster lens (Nikkor 55mm f/1.8) so that I don't have to rely on the flash anymore. So if you do a lot of this type of photography, keep in mind you will probably want another lens at some point.In all areas this camera has exceeded my expectations. After well over a year of devouring all types of information about digital photography, the only limitations to my personal photos when I go out with this camera are my own knowledge and creativity.

I wouldnt recommend the 18-105mm lens though. Its no good except for the most well light situations. Its terrible for using indoors. I rarely use it nowadays since I got the 35f1.8 lens. I hindsight I would either have got the 18-200 or 55-300 as a telephoto lens and used the 35mm for normal use. If I had more money, the obvious choice is the 70-200.

My lenses have been secure and I have not received any error messages. With most cameras I realize that the body is important but in reality it is the lens that makes the camera. Nikon has some of the best lenses so I invested in the D90. I love it. I haven't had any issues with it other than it being a little heavy at times. I attribute the heaviness to the weight of the lenses as well. I take this camera everywhere I go and it hasn't let me down yet.Few things to note:- GREAT Battery Life!- Great basic body (saves money... so you can spend the rest of the money on lenses)- Can be used professionally or for fun- Easy to use", "Date": "June 28, 2011"}, {"Title": "Worth the money to upgrade", "Author": "M.

I just got my new D90 about 3 weeks ago and I'm loving it so far. The image quality is beautiful and I'm already in love. The autofocus is an incredible improvement over the D60's. I love the 11 autofocus points compared to the 3 I was used to as well as the various different options that I feel are more accurate in tracking a moving subject (like my small kids) than my D60 was. One feature I've really enjoyed that I didn't know I would even want is the grid lines (optional) on the D90's viewfinder. I can keep my horizons level and use the \"rule of 3rds\" much easier and I feel more confident when composing my shots.I love the low-light capability of my new D90. I have taken shots at ISO 3200 that are usable. Yes, they are a bit on the noisy side, but compared to what I'd get on my D60, this is a dream come true. The shots were taken from far away inside a gymnasium for a graduation ceremony. They won't be blown up to a large size or anything, but they will work for posting them on the internet and including them in the photo books I like to create. I've been really impressed with the shots I can get, even with my \"slow\" 18-200 lens, fully extended even, in low (or less-than-ideal) light. I didn't like to use ISO 1600 on my D60 as I thought it was too noisy, but I feel perfectly comfortable using ISO 1600 on my D90. It's even better with my faster 35mm 1.8 lens.There are so many things I love about this camera. I love the large, bright lcd screen, I love the higher burst rate (super handy when trying to capture the fleeting smiles of my kids), I love the designated buttons to make quick changes without having to dig into the menu, I love the top display (which I didn't think I'd like at first, compared to looking on the lcd display info on the back of my D60), I love the many, many, many customization options, I love the movie mode even though it doesn't have full time auto focus (I adjust the focus ring on the lens if I need to make a change, no biggie), I love that it has a bracketing feature, I love that it can use my SB-600 flash off-camera and can use the older lenses that don't need their own motor to be able to auto focus.The only thing that I haven't liked about my D90 is how off the pre-set white balances are. Out of the box it seems like every setting has a strong green tinge to it in addition to being consistently on the cool side. Fortunately, things are very customizable and I've tweeked most of them to where I feel they are most accurate. I shoot in RAW, so it's not really a big deal since I can adjust that easily in post, but it made for a lot of extra work, so I finally just went in an changed the settings myself. If I were taking jpegs though, it would really, really bother me. This is the only reason I give the D90 4 stars instead of 5. It's actually more like 4 1/2, but I don't have that option. It's taken a lot of trial and error, taking lots of pictures and getting them onto my computer to see which settings are most accurate. It's something where I've only recently become comfortable with the results and it's something that I feel should be accurate out of the box on this level of a camera.As for the learning curve, it took a little while to become comfortable with my new D90, but coming from a D60 I don't think the learning curve was as steep as if this were my first dslr altogether. After fixing the white balance setting issues, I'm LOVING my new D90 and would highly recommend it to anyone looking to step up their photography skills. I also highly recommend the book \"Mastering the Nikon D90\" by Darrell Young. It's a very valuable tool in learning about and getting the most from you D90.Happy shooting!", "Date": "June 13, 2011"}, {"Title": "Just the best!

I quickly outgrew the features and wanted to make an informed purchase. So, after doing months of research from various sites, speaking with professionals, reading articles, etc.I finally found the perfect DSLR for my purposes! I photograph everyday, an aspring pro with a degree in photography but stuck in a daily grind job I needed a camera that allowed me to photograph for fun and practice my passion.The D90 allows me to take great shots in all types of lighting conditions which was the biggest obstacle I had with the D40. The ISO goes to 3200 and can be pushed higher with minimal grain.The automatic focus is quick, so you don't lose that all important action shot and you can lock in on the subject and recompose your pic, love that. The feel of the D90 in your hand is wonderful, it's a bit heavier than the D40 but not too heavy that it becomes a burden to hold or lug around all day. The overall functions of the D90 are easy to control w/o having to take your eye away from the viewfinder! I typically shoot manual so I haven't experimented too much with the functions such as portrait or sports, etc. The one thing I found that I hadn't read was that you can create a slide show to music right in the camera. I really don't have much use for that but was able to create a show for a presentation at work w/in minutes, it was fun and people loved it! Also, I find myself using the in-camera editing tools more and more, I still edit in Photoshop but really only for \"trickery\". Nikon has come far in providing great color balance features, white balances, a straightening tool, etc. too many awesome featrues to list! I also purchased the kit lens 18-105 which is fantastic! Best kit lens as far as quality, clarity, and function I have ever owned! The video feature is also wonderful, I didn't think I'd have much use for it but I have found it much fun to use! With the ease of a button, you can begin a video and at any point click back into picture mode. So, overall the D90 being at the higher end of an ameteur spectrum is a respectable camera that produces professional results, and is a solid, quality product.

Well, I found it!!  The D90 doesn't seem to even let you take a bad picture.  I am purely an amateur, but know a good picture when I see one.

The Olympus sometimes just would not take a picture if the light was low no matter how many times you pushed the button, even on manual.  It was so frustrating.  This camera takes great shots even in low light.I also bought the Zeikos ZE-NBG90 Battery Power Grip for Nikon D80 & D90 to go with this camera so I would have plenty of battery life.

There are so many more nice features, and one of my favorites is the info screen on the top deck, boy is this a nice feature to have. You get to see all your setting as well and manipulate them while viewing what you're doing. The pictures look amazing. The pictures look very professional!

My goal was to have a camera that both my wife and I could use for everything.. family pictures, camping trips, wildlife, sports action shots, etc., and I knew that the only way to do all that stuff well was with a good camera and several good lenses.I almost went with the Lumix DMC-GF1, being attracted to its small body. However, I ended up deciding against it due to the relatively limited number of four-thirds lenses available (both from Panasonic and in the market at large), and the huge number of high-quality lenses available from Nikon (Nikkor) and other vendors like Tamron, Sigma, etc. I decided against the Canon line due to issues I've had with Canon on other (non-camera) devices.Anyway, out-of-the-box, with the 18-105mm kit lens, I was taking fantastic pictures effortlessly with the \"automatic\" settings. I also purchased the Nikon 70-300mm f/4.5-5.6G for some serious zoom capabilities. But what really impressed me was the very easy way of using Shutter and Aperture priority modes - before I knew it, I was taking high-shutter-speed, high-frame count photos of kids in the pool - the good shots all have the \"wow\" factor that I've missed with other cameras.I say that this camera is \"educational\" because using it is actually teaching me how to be a better photographer! Before I got the D90, I had a passing understanding of aperture, shutter speed, focal lengths, etc., but using the D90 has made me want to take FULL advantage of it, so I've paid even more attention to how it's doing what, and now understand why some lenses cost so much.I'm toying with buying a \"prime\", faster, lens, because I'd like to get some neat-looking \"bokeh\" pictures - and also a macro lens for taking some close-ups.So, in summary, if you're thinking of moving up from a lesser camera into the pro-sumer DSLR camera, the D90 is (imho) a fantastic choice.", "Date": "July 5, 2010"}, {"Title": "Nikon D90 Digital Camera", "Author": "John Anderson", "ReviewID": "R2F2O6LAFVQ5BP", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "As my second new Nikon, the D90 attests to Nikon's continued perfection in photography.

I still do not like Nikon's 1.5x multiplier with lens focal length, but I have gotten used to it. Unless you happen to be doing a lot of smaller room photography (which I do, as a Real Estate photographer) then this is a negligible gripe. Video and live-view are awesome additions over the D80, though for some reason I would like to see 1080p @ 30fps. I don't know why, but since it's a standard, I think it would have been easy enough for a 12.3 MP camera to include...Other than those two small gripes everything else about the D90 is flawless. 12.3 MP is enough for one of those Big-Macs you see on the side of the McDonald's semi trucks, and unless you crop like crazy in your graphics editor, you should rarely ever need more than 6 MP. The live-view is awesome, especially if you are trying to photograph over the tops of crowds at sporting events. (Something that was impossible to get right with a D80.) The huge screen is large enough to watch the entire Star-Wars saga on. Okay, I exaggerate, but it is very beautiful. Button placement is perfect, and coupled with the literally thousands if not millions of Nikon accessories out there, it is a no-brainier. While the D90 is a very large camera, it has everything to do anything. If you are looking at cameras, please stop and just get this one. You really won't regret it.On a side-note, I HIGHLY recommend getting a wireless remote for the D90.

Beddow", "ReviewID": "R1L0O8RGUT9HT5", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I got the Nikon D90 after considering the Canon T2i in some detail. The two major features that sold me on the Nikon was a superior exposure and color system, and a better kit lens. Since I have a long technical involvement in photography I don't mind customizing a lot of settings and changing settings before shots.  If that isn't your style, you might think twice about the complexity of the D90.The biggest drawback is the focussing system, for me.  I have tried the automatic and manual focussing both, and seem to trip over some detail of the system a little too often for my comfort.  If you have it on single point auto focus, you can be reasonably sure of what you are going to get for focus...reasonably.  But too often I have used this set up on, say, a single face in a group or on a flower stamen, for example, and found that the actual focal point in the image fell about 5-8% of the distance to the object behind the object under the focus highlight in the viewfinder.  Not terrible, but enough to spoil some carefully set-up shots.  Autofocus using 3d focussing does not work for me, and multipoint focussing always leaves me with the focus point highlight somewhere I don't expect it.  If I am very alert and fully aware of what is going on, I can catch this and correct it by half-pressing the shutter and manually moving the focus point where I want it using the click dial.  But it spoils the flow of attention on a shot.  In fairness, I suspect some tutoring by an experienced user might overcome these perceived difficulties, but the documentation and materials I have found online do not address this issue well enough for me so far.I don't think there is a perfect camera out there.  It took me over 20 days of shooting every day to finally feel I understood the options and their effects on my shooting style.  I only gave the Canon an hour in the camera shop and several hours of close reading on the web, and that isn't the basis of a fair comparison.But the pentaprism viewfinder does provide a larger, brighter in-camera image to compose with.  If you like to experiment, the range of control you have is great.  And since I am on a limited budget, the kit lens gives me a broader range of focal lengths to work with.I also like the battery life and the size/form factor of the camera.  It fits my hand better.My impression might be skewed by the fact that I got a Nikon s8000 at the same time, and despite the smaller image sensor on the s8000, it is giving the D90 a real run for its money in image quality and ease of use in quite a range of picture settings.  The D90 is superior in low light and fast response, which alone still makes it worth it all for me.  But I have shot the same outdoor scene with both cameras, and printed 13 x 19 prints and could not tell which was from which camera.  Indoor shots are usually easy to distinguish.The D90 feels rugged and well made, and I haven't had the info drop-out from the lens problem that seems to plague some users.Ideally I would like to have waited for the next version, which would have full HD, stereo mike external jack, and 50% or more increase in sensor resolution.  But I finally decided that the wonderful color and exposure intelligence built into the D90 was not going to get appreciably better in the next version, and increased sensor resolution has hit a physical limit where design tradeoffs have to be made, so I went ahead and took the plunge.I haven't regretted it. But I would be careful to whom I recommend it. If you are impatient or intimidated easily by technical complexity, this camera might end up on your shelf more often than not.As a side note, I was concerned at first about the weird video on this camera.  Read around on the web and you will find out what I mean.  But after taking a series of videos on the tripod, foregoing zoom and pan and concentrating on focal plane movement only, I am pretty happy with it as a DSLR adjunct to my full HD camcorder.", "Date": "April 13, 2010"}, {"Title": "I <3 this camera!", "Author": "Christian Alperson", "ReviewID": "R31ZBSD5LMYGPO", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I just got this camera for Christmas '09.

Instead, because the 50 mm is really 75 mm given the 1.5 Dx crop factor, which is way too telephoto for indoor shots in my house, I got the Nikon 35mm f/1.8G AF-S DX Lens for Nikon Digital SLR Cameras and have been very happy because it acts like a 50 mm prime and is an unbeatable combination of speed and price at f/1.8 and about two hundred dollars. I still think the kit lens is useful for the range, especially for outdoor shots when low light is not a problem. Back to the camera itself, it is like all DSLRs bulky and mildly obtrusive at events as compared to a compact or subcompact that fits in a shirt pocket, but that is the price for better pictures. A 16GB card will hold tons of RAW and up to 4300 jpgs. Video sucks because of the lack of auto focus, so it's okay for very short clips with little motion, not longer or larger scenes. Still, I think it's worth the price to have video for those moments when just a few seconds of video will capture the essence of what is happening, which would have otherwise been missed trying to switch to a camcorder (not that I would carry both at the same time).

I don't print pictures too often but do so occasionally.2. I wanted to get two lenses(with VR/IS option), one in the 70-100 mm range(daily use) and the other in the 100-450 mm range(wildlife/birds).3. Low noise images even at higher ISO(1600+).4. Built-in image sensor cleaning ability.5. Easily accessible dials and buttons with which I can change the settings quickly without going into the menu every now and then.6. Fast autofocus even in low light conditions. At the end of the day, manual focus can be a real pain for a good number of scenarios.7. Fast continuous shooting mode with the ability to shoot 4+FPS.8. All the above including the two lens within $1500.9. Live view was not a must have but a good to have feature.Because of the bad experience with Canon I was pretty much predetermined to go with Nikon. D300 was pretty much out of my budget range so D90 was the only option if not D5000. I went through numerous review's and all suggested that D90 is packed with about 80% of D300 features. The only thing I was worried about is the D90 HOT PIXEL's issue, but I was well aware that the issue was not limited to D90 only, several other DSLR's including Canon DSLR's have those issues.I finally ordered my D90(with kit lens) in Nov'09 and have used it for two major trips so far, the results were awesome. The lenses used were the kit lens 18-105mm VR and the 70-300mm VR.Pros -1. Low noise even at higher ISO(1600+)2. Excellent image quality with vibrant colors. I usually shoot at +1/+2 saturation.3. White balance is an excellent feature if exploited properly.4. Exposure is handled quite well if switched properly between Matrix, Center weighted and Spot metering.5. 3-inch LCD monitor, you would appreciate the results right after you have captured them.6. The viewfinder is bright and easy on the eyes. You can go shooting without the live view for hours.7. You gotta live with the fact that the kit lens ain't a prime lens but can produce some stunning results.8. Auto D lighting is a pretty cool feature.9. Overall a camera with exceptional customization provisions to take your creativity to the next level if you understand the basics.Cons-1. Live view really needs improvement. By the time it focuses the subject will be gone. If u turn live view on and give the camera to a novice to take your snap both the camera and novice will be in trouble. Canon 50D does a far better job.2. No autofocus while capturing video's is primitive. If there is a model with no video and a few dollars cheaper I would have chosen that.3. Even with a Sandisk class 10 SD card(30mbps transfer rate) I really couldn't get 4.5 FPS beyond a certain number of shots.Final Package bought-1. Nikon D90 with 18-105mm VR kit lens.2. Nikon 70-300mm VR.3. 2*Tiffen 67mm UV Protection Filter.4. SanDisk 16GB Extreme - SDHC Class 10 High Performance memory card.5. One extra EN-EL3E 2000mAh Li-ion Battery .6.

It does not come to replace my existing compact (Panasonic LX3) and u43 camera (Panasonic GH1) but rather to add/complete the capabilities those cameras are lacking.This is just an initial impression after a few weeks of advanced amature use. D90 - even with the kit lens - provides significantly better low light capabilities, flash photography (even with the simple SB-400 it wipes the floor with GH1/FL36 combo), kids (camera is much more responsive) and sports (same reason). Going beyond the kit lens, Nikon today has a very decent line of DX prosumer lenses which are usually cheaper compared to similar lens in u43 world. I can highly recommend 35mm/1.8 prime (200$) and 70-300 VR telephoto.Ergonomically D90 is better compared to GH1, with more controls available through dedicated buttons on the camera body. The controls lay out works well for me too.Build quality of D90 body is reasonable. My only complaint so far is related to the fact that D90 has already developed a bright red hot pixel visible at ISO 400 and above. Kit lens build and feel is indeed cheapo (many reviewes mention this) but image quality is surprisingly good for a consumer lens, and taking its price into consideration the price/performance ratio is great.D90 video capability is a joke compared to GH1. Focusing speed in live view (CDAF) is slower than 50$ compact.At the end of the day, pretty much in line with what I expected, D90 excells in specialized usages I mentioned above, but GH1 will continue to serve as general purpose/travel kit thanks to it portability, articulated display, video capabilities and reasonable stills quality.", "Date": "January 21, 2010"}, {"Title": "top choice", "Author": "Elizabeth Ritzman \"Betsyritz\"", "ReviewID": "RJLG3574BTU1S", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "intuitive, pro quality. easy choice for a pro or entry level.

I upgraded from a Nikon D70 to the new D90.  The D90 has a much larger and brighter LCD view screen that is great for viewing photos after you have taken the shot as well as for viewing in the \"Live\" mode such as when you are shooting video.  I love the fact that this camera shoots HD video as well as photos.  I found the quality of the video to be excellent.  It is also very easy to use.About the only negative I can think of is the fact that when you are shooting in video mode, the auto focus doesn't work if you zoom in or out.  If you zoom, you have to use  manual focus control, which is something of a pain.  However, I think I can overcome this by editing the video clips later in Photoshop Premiere or Corel Video Studio Pro.Altogether I am extremely pleased with this camera and it's performance.  The selling point, for me, was the fact that it included the ability to shoot HD video.  I am primarily a still photo photographer, but I found the ability to have HD video in the same camera I use for still photography to be the perfect solution for me.  (If you shoot video as your primary mode, this may not be your cup of tea, however.) Video clips are limited to 5 minute clips, I think, based on the cameras manual.  This is not a problem for me, however, since I shoot video in small clips anyway, and then edit the clips using video software.  That may not work if you are looking for videos in larger than 5 minute segments.Several video resolution options are available, depending on your reason for shooting video.  If you don't need HD video, lower resolutions may be selected on the cameras menu.  This model uses SD memory cards, which have come down significantly in price recently.  I purchased both an 8 Gig and a 16 Gig SD card, both of which give me plenty of memory for both still and video shooting.If you are looking for a quality camera to use primarily as a still photo camera, but want the ability to shoot video as well (with the 5 minute limitation), this would be an excellent choice.

So, I waited......and this camera was worth the wait! It's amazing! It's easy to use, feels solid and well-built in your hands. The controls are well-placed and intuitive. The picture quality is amazing, color is spot-on (hardly do I ever have to do post color correction). This is my first Digital SLR and I must say again, it was worth the wait.With two small children, my point-and-shoot just never quite captured the moment. I would always catch my son mid-blink or looking away just after I got his attention. No more! The shutter speed on this is excellent and the 4.5 fps high-speed continuos mode is great for children when you never know which moment they may look at the camera.If you've been waiting to enter the Digital SLR market, this is the perfect pro-sumer camera to get you started. Great auto controls for the beginner and advanced controls when you are ready to take full control.The HD movie mode is ok, but that's not why I bought this camera. That is just icing on the cake. The only downside is no autofocus. So, it's really only good for subjects that remain at the same distance and aren't moving too much. I have a 7-month old daughter who is not yet mobile, so it's great for videos of her. Although, I use my Canon SD870 point-and-shoot for most other movie needs.Don't bother with the D40, D40x or D60, spend the extra couple of hundred bucks and go with this one. This is essentially the D300 for less money. I opted to not go with the kit lens after reading reviews of the 18-105mm. Instead, I went with the 18-200mm VR lens which is the perfect single-lens solution. It's wide enough that you can barely tell the difference between it and the 16-85mm and the 200mm reach allows you to get supercloseups from a great distance. So, far it's my only lens.

I bought my first digital camera back in 1997: a Sony with a floppy drive storage.  Boy have we come a long way!  When I compare this camera to some of the full frame models like the Nikon D3 and the upper end Canon models, the D90 holds its own considering the other cameras cost over $6000 more! I know the D3 has twice the pixel count (24.5mp to 12.4mp) but the only time the human eye (at least mine) can see a difference is when the picture is blown up to poster size or major cropping takes place. The D3 also has a faster continuous shooting speed of 9 frames per second (fps) to 4.5 fps for the D90. While this gives a definite advantage to the D3 in shooting fast moving sports activities,  4.5 fps is still pretty fast.  The \"quality\" ISO setting is double the D90 but I find ISO 3200 on the D90 more than adequate and rarely use that. Finally the D3 is a full frame camera giving it an advantage when shooting with a wide angle lens.  Of course you could argue the D90 has an advantage in the telephoto end since it extends the focal length.Don't get me wrong, I am not bad-mouthing the D3:  it is a fine camera.  My point is the D90 has virtually all the features the D3 has except the ones I previously mentioned and you can take the $6000 you save and can spend that on top quality lenses.So, what do I like about the D90? Well my \"Top 10\" (in no particular order):  1) Beautiful large high resolution LCD display  2) Movie mode: great for spur of the moment video capture  3) D-lighting  4) Button layout and quick access to changing parameters (rarely go into menu when shooting)  5) Live view: I like to manually adjust white balance and you can see the effect in Live View mode as adjustments are made  6) In camera editing functions  7) Info button: when depressed shows virtually all settings in shooting mode and allows key changes to be made when pressed twice  8) Ability to use Nikkor lenses (especially the fast 50mm 1.8)  9) Price ++++  10) Last, but not least, the beautiful pictures!If you are wondering if I spent the $6000 I saved by choosing the D90 over the D3, the answer is no.  I did buy the Nikon 18mm-200mm VR lens ($650), the Nikon 50mm 1.8 lens ($125) (might just be the best Nikon lens ever made on a dollar for dollar basis) and the Sigma 70mm - 300mm zoom ($200).  I am about to purchase the Sigma 150mm 2.8 macro ($729).  If you check out the reviews here on Amazon for that lens, you will get an idea why I am buying it. I can hardly wait to start shooting in macro mode with that lens.  So my total expenditure on lenses will be less than $1800.Lastly, if you are thinking of buying this camera, I can strongly recommend it and also recommend you consider buying it through Amazon.

I simply took pictures non-stop for six months and began to learn how to adjust settings. While I use the non-automatic settings you can get great pictures using the automatic settings as well despite what the books and critics say. I like nature photography and the fast setting has given me some great shots of birds in flight and animals on the run (horses, coyotes, deer, rabbits, etc). I recommend getting a Nikkor 70-300mm lens for telephoto and a Nikkor Micro 105mm for close-up work. You can use the 70mm-300mm without a tripod because it comes with vibration control. Very nice, indeed. With the 18mm-55mm lens that comes in the kit this is all the lens you will need to cover a wide range of shooting. I have photo's in galleries from this camera.

It was a budget buster for me so I did very extensive research.I found no other camera in it's class that received so many rave reviews from people I respect and mostly trust.So... after agonizing for months about spending over a grand, I finally made the plunge.I've only had it for 2 months and although I'm still learning how to properly use it, I absolutely love it.The picture quality is stunning, even for someone like me who has never used a DSLR before.When I first got it and was looking over the manual I was a bit overwhelmed and intimidated. There's a lot to learn!However, the auto modes and scene settings are there and they are as easy to use as any point and shoot.I mean, you can start taking great pictures immediately and learn the technical side at your own pace. At least that's what I've been doing.I've found a web site called the \"Nikon D90 User's Guide\" by Ken Rockwell and that's been a huge help. He explains in simple terms how to go beyond the auto settings and learn how to take great photos.\"Keep it simple\" usually works best for me and many thanks to Ken for his well written guidance and valuable tips.One reason I chose the D 90 over other brands was that it was supposed to take low noise photos in low light situations.It has not disappointed me in that. It's easy to turn off the flash and if you have a steady hand (with the help of the vibration reduction lens) the results are excellent.Some people may find the D90 to be too heavy but I don't. Using the camera neck strap and supporting it with one hand, I've walked with it for hours.It feels solid and like it's made with quality, which makes a little extra weight worth it.If you love photography and want to step up to the next level, I think you'll be quite happy with the D90.", "Date": "May 17, 2009"}, {"Title": "excellent for customization and control", "Author": "D. Gorlova", "ReviewID": "RVVGUFU4C9P9R", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Well, I'm no camera expert, but you can get my opinion as an amateur photographer, feeling too limited by the point-and-shoot and looking for an equipment upgrade.And what an upgrade this is!  I am in love with this Nikon, for the most part it does everything I need quite well.  Colors are excellent, vibration reduction is great, and it is low-noise.  I was fairly unfamiliar with all the functions, but a read through the manual made everything very intuitive, and I am surprised how fast I caught on.  So I also enjoyed to find that it was easy to learn.One of my favorite aspects is the ability to do some photo editing on-camera:-  You can do a quick re-touch, which automatically adjusts levels for better contrast and color balance.-  apply filter effects: warm filter, skylight (I still don't know what that is), blue filter, red filter, green filter, even cross-screen (more customizable than the actual filter, but not as organic and worse in quality than actual filter, so it has its pros and cons against the actual).-  adjust color levels on a four-dimensional color grid.-  adjust D-Lighting.  This is a really really awesome feature to have, definitely a favorite!-  fish-eye effect, as well as a sort of reverse fish-eye to correct for distortion-  resize-  tilt-  RAW processing-  crop-  and probably more that i am forgetting-  monochromatic in BnW, Cyanotype, and Sepia.  The latter of the two being adjustable in saturation.  You can also customize it further in shooting mode - you can pick almost any color and saturation!I especially enjoy the absolute customization you have over the white balance.  You can select a preset, make your own presets in several ways, or adjust color temperature easily before every shot.  Actually you can customize almost anything on this camera, and I love having my control.  Most settings are really easy to change with the external buttons, without going into the menu.Live View is also a huge plus, but less helpful than I imagined.  Apparently using Live View for extended periods of time damages the camera's sensor, and the camera has a very difficult time focusing in LV mode.There is a limitation with the viewfinder; it only shows about 95% of the space (that exists in all Nikons in this range, as far as I'm aware, and I don't know if other brands are any different).The movie option is good to have, but even though it's HD, the quality isn't that great so it's just something that's nice to have as an option.The only thing I can try to complain about is the camera's sensitivity to temperature.  But this is an issue with all cameras, so there's nothing that can really be done.  The manual says not to use the camera in below-freezing temperatures, but I have done so and so far it still works (I got a protection plan so I'm not too worried about ruining it to get some dazzling snow shots!).  If it's in the cold for long periods of time, however, it begins displaying error messages.  It seems that it loses contact with the CPU of the lens and does not detect it.  (Actually, my other qualm is that sometimes it seems to lose this contact for no particular reason, which is annoying, but all I have to do is shift the lens slightly tighter onto the mount.  I don't know if this is a problem with all cameras, but it seems that mine in particular isn't perfectly crafted, that the lens doesn't lock on the mount tightly enough, or something). If it's really cold, sometimes it displays another error and freezes up, so I can't even turn it off.  So my recommendation is to keep the camera out of the cold as much as possible, and what has kind of worked for me is keeping it zipped up under my jacket between shots.  Of course, it's better to stay out of the cold altogether.One other qualm, actually.  I have noticed after transferring the photos that they are not the standard length/width ratio.  They are slightly more panoramic/narrow, with black strips on the top and bottom filling out the rest of what should be the photo.  I have no idea what this is all about, and I haven't noticed any settings for this, so although it might be my fault completely, I don't have evidence to believe that it is.Overall I am very pleased with my baby, I named her Delila, and we are going to live happily ever after.  Or rather, until I have progressed enough as a photographer to crave more sophisticated equipment.So that's my very lay-man opinion.  I recommend this camera to anyone who is looking for a hardcore upgrade from a point-and-shoot, and those who highly value having control and customization.  For most intents and purposes, this camera will get the shot for you...EDIT...the matrix metering and the D-Lighting work great; the camera has a great sensor and captures an very good range of shadows/highlights.", "Date": "January 9, 2009"}, {"Title": "Fantastic body a great beginner's lens", "Author": "C.

I've been learning about photography on and off for over a year, so it's nice to be able to finally put the principles in to use.  This camera body could literally not make it any easier to adjust the settings.  I love that it has 2 scroll wheels, which makes shooting in full manual a breeze (one wheel for the shutter and the other for aperture).  Bottom line, I love this camera.Now the reason I dropped this to a 4 star rating.  The main reason I opted up to the D90 rather than something like the Nikon D60 10.2MP Digital SLR Camera with 18-55mm f/3.5-5.6G AF-S DX VR Nikkor Zoom Lens was the LiveView and the support for older auto focus lenses.  But the fact that auto focus takes about 5 times longer while using LiveView (and I really don't think that's an exaggeration, think 0.5 seconds vs 3 seconds) means that I pretty much never use the LiveView.  And I'm not a professional photog so I'll really only ever need a handful of lenses so I don't really need the support for the really old lenses.Also, a quick note about the video mode.  The quality of the video can be amazing if you know what you're doing (a friend of mine in L.A. is actually planning on shooting some guerilla-style films on it since most people won't realize you're shooting video on a still camera), but be aware that the nature of the video capture means you can't really pan left and right too quick without some weird effects. [...]Finally, I will suggest to anyone buying this camera (or any first-time DSLR owner) that you pick up a Nikon 50mm f/1.8D AF Nikkor Lens for Nikon Digital SLR Cameras to go with it.  Don't get all penis-compensation and start buying huge zoom lenses (unless of course you actually do plan on shooting mostly landscapes and sporting events).  It's a super cheap lens and you will definitely appreciate the pictures that come out a lens with a decent aperture.Anyway, the long and the short of it is, this camera is fantastic, but I sometimes think a D60 at half the price may have been the way to go.", "Date": "January 7, 2009"}, {"Title": "Little things missing to make this one perfect", "Author": "rj", "ReviewID": "R3AGPNZ4BAFNGJ", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "The good things about the D90 have been pointed out by many, so I am not going to repeat everything.

The matrix metering tends to blow out highlights, and I really wonder why they set it that way, because the metering per se works well and is consistent.2. Flash sync speed of 1/200 is an outdated waste of photons. Seriously, didn't the D70 have 1/500?3. Focus fine tuning is definitely missing.4. More focus points would be nice.5. The autofocus assist is not really intimate. It is technically good, but too bright for most subject's tastes. Maybe it could be pushed more towards the far reds?6. Chromatic aberration correction works great - why not in RAW?7. No flash sync port (PC or audio).8. The sensor for the infrared shutter release is in a bad location, the shutter release mode should also not switch back to default automatically.8. Video, LV, GPS port and all the dummy modes are a waste of weight and button space. This camera would be better if designed like a photographer's camera.9. I believe if Nikon would build larger viewfinders for DX, fewer people would still carry full frame cameras. Please make it bigger! (I also miss split screen focussing screens from film SLRs. Can't they be included in DSLRs to allow precise manual focussing?)The D300s has some of the things I am missing, but it in my opinion it is too big and too heavy considering it basically offers you the same images.But in summary, you cannot really go wrong with the D90.Update: KatzEye makes split prism focussing screens for DSLRs.

You probably just like taking pictures, and your point and shoot camera is just not giving you the ability to take those magazine cover photos. Am I right? Do yourself a favor, Stop losing sleep over a blog your read the previous day before. You obviously are curious about the Nikon D90 if you have read this far. I am seriously going to tell you what to do now. I am making the decision for you! Don't get the D80 its to old. Go to a camera store, feel the D90 it, shoot with it, love it, and crave it. Buy the Nikon D90 Kit from Amazon. Yes I said kit and amazon. That includes the 18-105mm VR lens with lens hood(to make it official). You are asking yourself \"wait, I heard that the kit lens are not a good choice and that I should blah blah blah.\" The 18-105mm VR lens is a GREAT sharp kit lens! Don't go and buy some other lenses that you think is nice and functional (trust me you shall lose money). This is what's going to happen. You are going to get the lens and see \"what you need\". Yes, what you need. Do you need that extra zoom to see the top of a mountains? Do you need that portrait lens for Grandma? Do you need what ever kind of lens you can think of and then \"Grow\" into it. Grow. The Nikon D90 is a awesome DSLR beginner's camera. Has just enough Megapixels (Ha, maybe too much). You will not be disappointed. Don't be afraid that you don't know what you are doing. I'm sure you have a sense of what you are doing. That two months worth of research didn't expound your knowledge of a camera? Shoot with it. Your creativity will explode! I guarantee that this Nikon D90 has all the functionality you need as a beginner, novice, um someone who is sick of his/her point and shoot camera and wants that creative edge.From a concerned customer,Jacobp.s. Buy from Amazon. You save 200-300 dollars than you would going to a camera store (plus you don't have to put up with crappy customer service). And don't worry about it getting to you safely. It will.

Ray", "ReviewID": "R1KK1DV7YCUZXC", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I've owned a point and shoot camera for 2 years now, and I have always been jealous of the quality and versatility of DSLR cameras. I didn't want to chunk down $1K on a camera without knowing about them, so I did a lot of homework. Before purchasing the Nikon D90 w/ kit lens, I researched several web sites along with other photographers and artists alike. All sources pointed to the Nikon brand for it's high quality build, reputation and ease of transition from newbie beginner shots to the professional arena. I opted for this model in lieu of previous cheaper Nikon's so I can use older glass prime lenses with the D90, thus potentially saving me money in the future when it comes to buying different lenses. The kit lens is an excellent beginner lens, however after 500 or so pictures, I can see it's limitations, and will be looking for a 50mm f/1.4-f1.8 lens for better portrait pictures. I would not, however, go and buy a ton of expensive lenses before you use the kit lens and determine if it is enough for you or not. I searched several competitor web sites and stores and Amazon offers the best price for this kit. Other web sites are roughly $120-200 more for the same kit (October 2009). I knew that a camera of this caliber would be a challenge, so I bought a book on digital photography specifically around the D90 prior to purchase. I have the grasp of the basic functions, and regular day pictures, however night photography is a little trickier. I would highly recommend a tripod if you plan to shoot a lot in low light conditions. Even though the camera has VR, it does not fix all movement/exposure issues in low light conditions.MAIN PROS:- Great price- Ease of use (with basic features)- Interchangeable with older lenses for better future value- Live View- Great 12.3 megapixels for very sharp photos- In camera photo editing- Shoots in RAW & JPEGMAIN CONS:- Nikon software is TERRIBLE! I use a Mac running 10.6 snow leopard and the software crashes constantly. Nikon's web site has no solution for this, even after the software supposedly updates itself after install. Apple's Aperture, iPhoto and Adobe products have no problem recognizing the camera and quickly importing the photos.- Kit does not include a SD card, therefore preventing you from taking pictures right out of the box. Prepare to make a run to the store for a minimum of 4GB SD card (takes about 1K JPEG photos).", "Date": "October 21, 2009"}, {"Title": "It's a D300 for half price.", "Author": "Stuart D.

But being the tech-geek that I am, I was intrigued by the Nikon D90's movie mode. I was looking at possibly getting a HD digicam later this year for those occasional times I wanted to record video (family events, recording golf swings, etc.). But then the D90 was announced, so I waited until I could see it in person. I walked into my local camera shop, and played with the camera for about 20 minutes. I was hooked.The movie mode works as advertised. Yes, it has a 5 minute limit (in HD), but I have yet to find that to be an issue. I'm not claiming that the D90 replaces a dedicated video camera, but for 95% of my video needs, it fits the bill perfectly. But as cool as the movie-mode is on the D90, what really won me over was the better dynamic range of the D90. Don't get me wrong, my Olympus took some great photos, but the Nikon clearly handles bright/dark shots better (maybe due to Active D-lighting?). The camera feels terrific in my hands, has all the necessary features for a DSLR today (live view, dust-removal, VR (in the lenses anyway), etc.), and of course takes great photos. The color saturation is also wonderful (maybe the new CMOS sensor). And versus my previous Olympus setup, Nikon has a substantially larger collection of lenses to choose from.Back to movie mode, again it works as advertised. I filmed a few videos using the 720p setting and a 50mm f1.8 lens, and it turned out pretty cool. You'll have to purchase a separate mini-HDMI to HDMI cable to watch on your HDTV, but once you do, you can watch your videos in high-def. Pretty cool stuff. So, my final thoughts are to NOT buy this camera just because it has a video function. It works and its great, but the real reason to buy this camera is because of the fantastic image quality, ease of use, intuitive controls, and of course, the large array of Nikon gear available. I highly recommend this camera!", "Date": "September 22, 2008"}, {"Title": "Excellent camera and still comparable if not better than newer models", "Author": "Rick Goggil", "ReviewID": "RKY4MUECSXA3A", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I've owned this thing for 4 years or so now. Nikon has introduced a few models since then, but this thing is still just about perfect for the picture taking I do. Lots of lens choices, tons of features, ergonomics just fit my hands like I designed it for myself. I've looked at the newer stuff, and for the few things they've \"improved\" on, I still think this was and is the best fit for me. Only reason I could ever see moving it to second camera status is if I ever decide to go full frame. I'd love too, but tough to justify the price when this D90 does such a fine job even with the reduced sensor size.Here's some points to consider if looking at one of these to buy. Its a 12.3 megapixel camera. Smallish by recent new cameras, but more than enough to print very nice pictures 11x14 or larger in some cases. If you are using it for 4x6, you will have excellent results. The camera does shoot HD video, but it is limited to the 720, it will not shoot 1080. In my experience, autofocus during video shoots leaves something to be desired. The camera, with the kit lens, 18-105, has very decent low light capabilities. Of course, the kit lens is slow, so a faster lens would improve low light capabilities. On a nice bright day, without using flash, the camera pops off 4.5 or 5 frames a second. I have used this camera a lot at the drag strip and have captured lots of great wheelie action using the continuious shooting. My daughter was also a polevaulter, and this feature allowed me to catch lots of great action shots as she went up and over the bar. I used it a few times, indoors, for high school basketball, with the 18-105 lens, it was slow and not so great. With a faster lens, excellent results indoors shooting action shots. The camera itself has lots of choices to select the type and heat range of the lighting you're shooting in, so great results are possible with incandesent, florescent, halogen, sunlight, moonlight, you name it, the camera can shoot in it.There are quite a few in camera editing functions to correct, um, operator error. LOL. Camera shoots in both color and black and white. There are various settings which allow quit, low grade snapshots, fine picture quality, and up to RAW settings. RAW allows, actually demands, that you have computer capabilities to edit the photos. RAW prints cannot be processed at your local Wal-Mart. The detail possible and editing possible in RAW is unbelievable. Be forewarned tho, RAW eats up lots of storage on your SD cards. There is an option to shoot both fine and RAW at the same time, which allows easy printing of the fine, and the capability to edit and change appearances in the RAW format.This camera has an internal focusing motor for the autofocus lens'. Nikon 3000 series does not have this feature. What does this mean? Not all lenses will autofocus on a 3000, where practically all autofocus lenses will function on the D90. There is also an auto/manual switch on the camera body which allows you to manually focus any lens attached to the camera if you desire more control than the autofocus feature allows. Speaking of lenses, the mounting design Nikon is using has been around since the late 70s. This means that some really nicely made Nikon lenses that you may have laying around from the 80s or 90s have a really good chance of working great on the D90. In the first part of my review, where I give my personal likings of the camera, I mention its a reduced sensor camera. This sorta works to your benefit. The reduced sensor has a multiplying effect on the lens rating. This is approximately 1.5 times. So, a 100mm lens on a D90 is equivalent to a 150mm lens on a full framed camera. 400mm is equal to 600mm, and so on.The camera has a nice large screen on the back to select options in the cameras menu. You can also change to live view which allows the screen to function as the eye piece. The screen is stationary, it does not tilt, swivel, flip, etc. Using it in live view also slows down the reaction of the shutter a bit. On top of the camera is a small simple screen that shows many of your settings at a glance. Using the small screen and function buttons you can switch shot quality, ISO, check battery charge, number of shots taken and number remaining on card, F stop, flash, etc.The camera also has two dials in very well placed positions. A front dial right below the shutter release, and a rear dial behind the shutter release. These dials do quite a few things, such as changing ISO, flash, and using both front and rear dials, you can change F stops and shutter speeds without pushing any other buttons first. So, for those desiring manual operation instead of auto, everything is very easy to change while looking through the eyepiece.The camera has a pretty decent built in flash and the capability of adding external flash attachments.In this review, I've only touched on a fraction of this cameras capabilities.

Originally I wanted a nicer camera to shoot for the family, and I knew Nikon was a reliable brand, and the D40's were very well priced. (It's how they hook ya!!!)  A few photography courses later (and a couple photos published in international magazines!) I've been hooked on Nikon cameras. Last year I upgraded to the Nikon D90. I love taking pictures of animals and children and landscapes as this is how it all started for me. I wanted something that could keep up with my family and pets. A shutter with a high enough speed to catch that \"one\" moment.  Some of the eye-catching qualities this D90 has, is a 3\" color screen with a \"live view\". People who use some of their earlier models (such as the D40) are probably used to having to view through the lens to get their picture. Well, now you don't. In addition to that, you can also shoot video (more on that in a bit.) 12.3 megapixel DX format CMOS sensor, ISO 200-3200, image sensor cleaning, AF, and in-camera retouching.  The camera is easy enough to use for a newbie, as you can set it to \"Auto\" (One of seven shooting modes) and literally just point and shoot and go about your merry way. The camera uses an SD card for memory, though Nikon warns that it should be of a couple certain brands or the camera may not accept it (After formatting the card through the camera, I have not had a problem using 'cheapie' SD cards with it, however).  Being a Nikon DSLR, however, you can, of course, go through and set anything and everything up manually to your liking, for the more serious hobbyist or professional.  The camera comes with a good quality lens, (18-105mm) a certain upgrade from the stock lens with the D40. (Though the lenses are interchangeable) I enjoy it's \"sounds\" compared to the D40, if that makes any sense haha! It's heavier and larger than the D40, which I appreciate as well.  I am a firm believer that one shouldn't by hybrid products with the hopes or assumption that the product does both (or all) tasks as well as the individual product would be. (Ie, point and shoots should not be expected to be a good video camera, or vice versa) And many other digital cameras I have used have proven this over and over, however the D90 video camera is quite impressive. Videos are limited to 5 minutes in length and have to be done via the lcd screen. It shoots HD videos with great color and quality, however has no AF (Auto Focus)--the only negative I can really give. It's perfect for catching special, spontaneous moments, high enough quality to use to create your own short film,  and even easy enough for the responsible kid to use for school projects or just for fun.  All and all, the camera is great. Good, hardy build to it. I've trucked it around to our farm, taken photos in the rain, and it has survived all our kids and pets without fail.  If you are wanting a DSLR and you haven't ever used one before, this one is easy enough to set, point, and shoot, and still come out with professional looking, breath taking photos. If you are a hobbyist, looking for something that does more than auto-set, this one has all the manual settings one could hope for.  And if you're a pro?

This is why I gave it a 4 star.I am really happy with the camera, I had Canons and really like the Nikon better now.In my opinion this camera is much easier to use, you can access the most important menu items (so many to list here..) without getting into menus.The programmable auto iso function is the best thing ever. You set the default iso that the camera uses in normal conditions (e.g. 200) then you set the maximum iso that you want to use to limit noise (e.g. 800) and finally you tell the camera what's the slowest shutter that you are comfortable with (e.g. 1/125).Let's make an example, indoor low light with the 50/1.8 and you don't want to use the flash. Now if you are in A mode and set for example 1.8, the camera will look at the light with iso 200 and decide how slow of a shutter it needs, if it's faster than 1/125 it will shoot 1.8-200-1/500 or so.. If 1/125 is too fast it will shoot something like 1.8-400-1/125. Finally if the light is so low what even iso 800 is not enough it will slow down the shutter beyond your comfort zone shooting for example 1.8-800-1/30.I find this a wonderful feature that I have heard Canons don't have. I highly recommend setting the custom function button to this auto-iso function because you will be setting this every time you change lens or zoom in and out (your comfort zone changes with focal lengths..)Video mode is just for fun, make a few short clips, that's it. Use a HD camcorder for long footage. No autofocus, exposure jumps visibly, and other bugs..The software is also very nice, transfers and views all image types in a breeze and you can also adjust, copy and export NEF files.

It was this or the Canon XSi, which is a fine camera at a great price point. As far as image quality goes, there is not much between them. But I decided to splurge on the more expensive Nikon, and I'm glad I did. Here's why:-- It feels more sturdy and better constructed, and it feels better in my grip.-- The button layout is very useful. I am an intermediate shooter, and I like to adjust settings on manual. You can do it very quickly on the D90.-- The LCD screen is big and brilliant, with a protector.-- The viewfinder is bright and clear.-- I really like having the top LCD for settings more than relying on the screen on back to monitor settings.-- I bought a flash and I like using the onboard flash as a master.One downside is that raw images are in NEF, which the Adobe software suite doesn't handle. CaptureNX (not included) is a fine program, but it is slow on my computer and I am not sure it is better than the Adobe options. The bundled ViewNX will convert NEF but you won't get the same control over the output.My partner switches it to auto mode and has a fine time using it as a point and shoot.", "Date": "March 2, 2009"}, {"Title": "Simple Review", "Author": "Deonsdreaming", "ReviewID": "R2FRNIEVE7W3RX", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I'm not a professional photographer, I use my camera as a hobby. This is the first major upgrade in a digital camera for me in ten years. Yeah I know, I know. But I waited until the right camera, with the right amount of megapixels for the right price came out. I don't like buying gear every three or four years becuse I just want to have it.So why I choose this the Nikon D90 camera?I get a camera that is fast enough (very important for me) so I don't miss a shot.I want to be creative with my photgraphy, and wanted lots of features.When I need to do large poster prints, I can do that with the high 12.3MP count. (I had 3.5MP with a point and shoot before this!)It's the right size for my hands! Very important. I never see anyone address this issue when shopping for a camera. I have large hands and long fingers, a small camera is very difficult to work with and is not very comfortable. Do yourself a favor go to any store and put the camera in your hands before you buy it! Does it feel solid in your hand? Are your fingers cramped? Is it to heavy or to light?The Movie mode was the tie breaker that made the difference between Nikon D90 and the Canon 50D.The Nikon D90 is more camera than I know how to useright now, but as you will notice from other users who have bought non prosumer cameras in the past they grow out of them fast. I'll have this camera  until they come out with 36MP cameras (when ever that is).

The D90 has been a great and reliable camera for me.  I have shot thousands of picture and have yet to have any issues with its quality.  Like any DSLR, the pictures you get often depend mostly on the user and somewhat more on the glass than on the body itself.  When looking at the body, look at the features, functionality, and ergodynamics first.  All of those I love.  While I'm planning on upgrading to an FX frame in the near future, I intend to keep my D90 as a back up or lighter option when needed.The most important feature on the D90 compared to modern entery level DSLRs in the same price range, in my opinion, are the manual dials.  This allows the photography to make quick and easy adjustments when in a manual mode without pulling the view finder from your eye.  Newer similarly priced DSLRs have regulated all of these tools to the LCD menus.

An avid D60 user though i am, it seems the D90 has taken precedence in my judgement of handling. D90 has proven to me to be much faster and the handling is better than i had anticipated. I only wish it had the vivid settings as there is in the D60. No challenged so far as over one year of use with this superb equipment i have been able to manipulate the camera settings though absolutely expelling the use of auto mode, the camera operates as i want it to. in comparison to newer versions of nikon cameras i am concluding that the D90 is in my opinion the next best entry level camera to the full frame and professional level camera family. The D90 has no competition in the DX class no matter how much pixels are pumper into the others. So my next experience should be the Nikon of either D700 or cameras from the D3X and D3S as the others based on my reviews are for users who are enthusiastic about learning photograpy. The D90 is for me a great entry level camera.

I love the D300, if I had to replace it the D90 would have to be a serious contender given the huge price difference.

Came down to the D90, the D7000 or the Canon t2i.  The Canon had a good set of features but felt lightweight and plastic-y in person.  The D7000 is a beauty but, at $1,500, was more than I was willing to pay for an upgrade.  The D90 offered the best overall package at a decent price, $920. Auto mode is as easy as any other camera, video is OK, better than what I expected given some of the negative comments I have seen on here.  Video is a bonus in this camera anyway and is not a reason to buy.  The photo quality is terrific, great depth and clarity.  Seems like a camera you can keep for the long haul and not outgrow, lots to learn and play with. The D90 has heft and is kind of heavy but feels like a tank compared with some others.  Keeping my fingers crossed about the much talked about lens connection error message problems.Camera was ordered on 1/23/2011 and arrived from J & R Music and Computer on 1/25/2011.  No complaints there although you cannot track the package with J & R, which can be a little disconcerting with a first time experience.

With free shipping, how can you not buy here?6-8-2012 UPDATEThis is a serious camera and it takes great pictures.  I will be learning it's features forever, no doubt.  After a couple of months of shooting in all modes, I noticed that dead pixels appeared in higher ISO photos in the same spot on the images.  Tried numerous \"fixes\" I found on the internet, but none worked.  These dead pixels became increasingly annoying to me since this was a new camera.  So, I dropped the camera off at Precision Camera in Connecticut, an authorized Nikon dealer, for a pixel fix while still under warranty.  Camera came back about a week later from the Texas facility with the same pixel issue, as if it were never remapped or repaired.  This is not an issue at lower ISO speeds and they are easily fixed in Picassa or Photoshop; they are just annoying.  More should be expected from a product with the Nikon name, especially after being repaired. If I had it to do again, I would return the camera earlier and not bother with trying to repair it.

Of course if you want to do more manual settings, you can.I would recommend getting a flash like the Nikon SB-600 to help with indoor shots since the on-board flash (like all on-board flashes)can create strange shadows.

It's my first digital SLR. I was nervous about the purchase price but wanted a good camera. I felt I'd learned to maximize the capabilities of my Lumix DMC-TZ5 and wanted more functionality and manual control. My husband encouraged me, giving me the first few hundred to cover the cost. I decided to purchase the Nikon D90 after spending weeks looking at reviews, holding cameras, checking prices, shopping for accessories. It's been two months and I'm still very, very happy!The camera feels great in my hand. It's just a little heavier than the Canon T1i, the grip seems a little deeper. It seems sturdy, professional. I'm not big on reading all the directions right away so it's nice that many of the controls are intuitive or easy to figure out after playing around a little while. I've successfully added and changed lenses, figured out what size filter is needed (67mm for the kit lens!), and installed the UV filter. I've shot photos with and without the LCD. I've tried multiple automatic and played with manual controls. I'm ready to read the manual and figure out what all those initials along the mode dial mean! I have a lot to learn about photography and I'm very happy to have the D90 to learn on!It's possible I would also have been happy with a lower-end model DSLR like the Nikon D3000 or the Canon XSi, but every salesperson I spoke with (different days and different stores) suggested I'd be happier with the D90 because I wouldn't \"outgrow\" it after a few years. I think I'll be able to say that this camera is still \"the one\" for me five or seven years from now! As a youngster, I consistently photographed my dog and my family. I switched from a very basic 110 to a low-end 35mm. I later took advantage of a drug store refillable 35mm camera and had them make digital copies of everything. I was ecstatic that my husband had an awesome (at the time) high-end Nikon CoolPix with rotating lens (I think it was a 995). I used it constantly! We replaced it with one of the cutting edge (at the time - lol) compact digital cameras - a Casio Exlim. For years, I've been the only person from my family and my hubby's family that has photographed all birthdays, holidays, and special get-togethers. I'm constantly photographing my pets (white cats, tabby cat, blonde dog, tan dogs) and critters in the yard (some great bird, bee, caterpillar, squirrel, raccoon, lizards, oh my!).Trial and error seem to have made me a little better photographer. I didn't want to study photography in detail, though, until I had a really good camera. The Nikon D90 is a really good camera! It makes me want to master all the basics and learn advanced techniques so my interest can really blossom!If you can spend the money on this camera, I think you, too, will be very happy with your purchase!3/18/11: I still love my Nikon D90 camera!

I would even choose this body over one of the pricier bodies if I were a pro shooting in a studio.Lastly, I also recommend getting the vertical grip.

I always thought the Sony took acceptable, even great at times pictures. It did, but the pictures out of this camera with the kit lens blew me away. This is before I even opened the instruction manual. I set it to auto and started shooting pictures. To say my interest in photography has been reborn is the understatement of the century. As a 53 year old man with two daughters getting married this year, I rationalized the need (desire) to get a new \"better\" camera that would capture the upcomming once in a life time events of this year.I am not new to photography, running the dark room in college and having later gone through a Cannon A1. That was given that away to what was a worthy subject at the time. But through the years, I have developed color film in the bathroom (Unicolor?) and eventually lost interest in the complex chemistry required to handle the outcome of my work.After \"being retired\" from the computer field earlier than I wanted, I have found hobbies that fill in my desire to embrace new technology. Let me tell you. I don't know how the field of Digital Photography changed so much, but wow. The D90 just takes pictures that I never thought would come from my efforts.I am currently reading 3 different books on the D90 and DP in general. So much is the same, but sooooo much is different. The lag time my old Sony had from the decision to take a photo, press the shuuter and actually capture the image often left a blank frame! Not this D90. Bam Bam Bam as quick as I can compose and shoot, I get what I see. Exactly what I see.I was impressed with the Sony that sported a Zeiss lens, but the Nikkor included in the D90 kit is an order of magnitude sharper and truer than the old camera. I am not an expert in today's photography, I know my way around the old wet photo process and enlargers and all the other mess involved in getting a picture out. In high school and college I had some of my work published (B&W;), so I understand the concepts, but now I get to apply my computer background to my old photography \"archives\" and with the D90, its going to be a blast.I am glad I waited for the D90, and I know the Video functions are a little lacking, but its a start. My new Sharp Aquos 65\" HDTV is just waiting to see what the Nikon can feed it.After going back and forth between Best Buy's price guarantee and Circuit City's close out liquidation, I bought the kit and other accessories for a very good price. I was prepared to pay about $160 more than I did, but the Best Buy cash register kept discounting items to make up for and meet the CC price down the street.This camera is a fantastic piece technology, that will produce pictures you won't believe you took.

All these actions create a long shutter delay and significant vibration.Because the mirror is held in the up position and the shutter is open in Live View, it consumes a great amount of battery charge and produces a great amount of heat for the circuit.It appears that Live View is released before the design is ready.Another problem is that Nikon changed the raw file format.

You can take as much or as little control as you are comfortable with.  As a previous poster has mentioned, do not buy the kit, purchase the body only and add lenses separately. I borrowed a friends D90 with a kit lens to see if it was the camera for me, thank goodness he had another premium lens or I would have probably not bought the D90.  With the kit lens it gives the camera a feel of cheapness and the picture quality is OK.  I have added a Nikon prime 50mm f/1.8 and a Sigma 50-150mm f/2.8.  Both have great glass and great response time (I highly reccommend them both).  I also bought the kit lens 18-55mm 3.5($50.00 used from the friend I initially borrowed the D90 from), it has its uses.My day job is a quality engineer for a major aerospace company (space shuttle core component supplier), and I am very scrutinous of everything engineered.  My opinion of construction quality is very favorable.  I love the way the lenses snap into place with no slop.  At first I was a little skeptical of the plastic body as opposed to the metal body of the D3 (which I have used). My night job is shooting youth sporting events for hours on end and the weight savings is sooooo apprecitated.  I geuss what I am trying to get to is, do not evaluate this camera with a kit lens.  I also recommend purchasing at least two (2) 4G cards with as high a write speed as possible. Not because the camera can't keep up but because your computer probably won't.  This camera has a large buffer, so fire away.If you want a very well written opinon of this camera from a professional photographer, I recommend you visit Ken Rockwells web page [...]  I do not know the gentleman, but when I was researching for this purchase I consumed all the information I could get and I made my determination after reading his review.  I highly recommend his webpage for just practical information on all things photographic.In closing, I highly recommend the D90 camera body with quality lenses (so far Nikon (not kit) and Sigma, I like).  If you thrive on validation and flattery, I also recommend this camera, because you will get a lot of  attention much like Ashton Kucher on the Nikon commercial.  I never tire of hearing \"let me see, let me see\".  I would rate it third behind children and puppies as a chick magnet.", "Date": "December 17, 2009"}, {"Title": "Nikon D90 vs Canon PowerShot G5", "Author": "Leonardo Strac \"Leo\"", "ReviewID": "RR7D7TW4O7Q23", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "After 6 years with my faithful G5 I decided to buy a new camera. Primary reason was shooting under poor light. First, I wanted to buy Canon G10, but I was disappointed with the quality of 15MP sensor. Then I wanted to buy Canon T1i, but I came out with Nikon D90. There are several reasons for that: reasonable pixel count, very good build quality, very useful and quite good kit lens (18-105), good raw conversion software (Capture NX) and attractive price at a moment.So, what's the filling when you leave 6 year old compact and start shooting with top quality SLR?What I like about Nikon D90:- Good high ISO capability. This is relief: you can peacefully shoot up to ISO 3200, while the G5 was out by the ISO 200. Also, Auto ISO is great in low light.- Kit lens is great. I really missed wide angle before.- Metering is very good, especially with flash- D-Lighting is beautiful feature- Very responsive and fast camera- Display is gorgeous- Lens servo capabilities are excellent- Viewfinder is very good. I was afraid of that little window since I'm used to look on much larger display, but I have no problem using it (even with glasses).What I dislike about Nikon D90:- Autofocus dot in the viewfinder is not easy noticeable and you never really know do you have focus or not unless you turn on that beeping which is loud and irritating. My old G5 can change the volume and sound of autofocus beep, why D90 can't?- Quite heavy- Awkward balance when you use a neck strap- I didn't think that would be the problem, but I miss that manual focus window that shows distance.- Lens is slow. I know, it's kit lens, it's cheap, but I'm used to G5 F2.0-3.0. High ISO can compensate it, but not entirely.- Live view is really done badly. But is still very useful feature in some situations.What I still like about Canon G5:- Size. The whole camera is as big as the 18-105 lens.- Autofocus is actually quite fast in good light. (It's the shutter lag that is the problem.)- Fast lens. That F2.0-3.0 is really great thing. It's disappointing that Canon put slower lens on new G7-G10- Very little lens distortion.- When you shoot in jpeg, you can still save the picture in raw while you reviewing it. That's very useful trick that I miss on D90.What I still dislike about Canon G5:- Noise. G5 have more noise on ISO 200 than D90 on ISO 3200. ISO 400 on G5 is unusable.- Red eyes are regular problem.- Purple fringing is terrible.- Very slow operation.- Bad autofocus in low light.- Lens not wide enough (35-140)", "Date": "July 2, 2009"}, {"Title": "Worth every penny!!!

The camera, just a few months old, wouldn't take a picture and \"CHA\" was displayed as an error message.

The ability to change just about any setting, even metering modes and enabling the IR remote, without diving into menus is wonderful, and was sorely missing from the D60. It's much more enjoyable, and easy, to shoot and get good pictures when the setting you want is easily available.A few other good/bad points:-The flash doesn't pop up automatically, except in 'Auto' mode, and even then you can disable the flash with the flash button and command dial. The D60 seemed to always want to use the built-in flash unless it was in daylight.-You can turn auto-ISO off in every mode, including 'Auto'. My only complaint here is that while you can select auto-ISO with the ISO button and command dial in 'Auto' mode, you can't in P/S/A/M, unless you have auto-ISO turned on overall, which prevents you from setting the ISO yourself.-For some reason, you have to go into the menus, or use the Function button, to select the AF area mode. You can select between continuous AF, single-servo AF and AF-Auto with the AF button and command dial, but the sub-command dial does nothing. It would be nice to use the AF button/sub-command dial to select between the AF area modes, rather than having to use up the only programmable button for it. Not really a big deal, but there's no need for it to be that way.-The AF/MF switch on the body is great. I assume it's to turn the built-in motor on and off for screw-drive AF lenses, and it also disables autofocus with AF-S lenses. I like being able to just flip that switch to turn the AF off, rather than having to mess with the tiny switches on the lens and hope I don't turn VR off or something.-A menu option to disable video recording would be nice. The video mode is practically useless anyway, and that would keep me from worrying about hitting the OK button while moving the focus point in LV and accidentally recording a movie.No huge complaints, and the few I mentioned could easily be fixed with a simple firmware update. Otherwise, I can't think of anything that I'd change, even compared to the heavier, much more expensive D300s.", "Date": "December 4, 2009"}, {"Title": "Nikon always the best", "Author": "JAFA", "ReviewID": "R325XLBGPANQMR", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "After fully researching on DC reviews allaround best source of independent testing.Nikon D90 lived up to its review.

I used to be an avid amateur photographer once upon a time, and I wanted to get back in the game with a great camera.  A couple of folks in my wife's family have older versions of the Nikon D series, and they NEVER leave auto mode.  So I will admit that I was concerned that these newer high quality digital SLRs would be too confusing to ever leave auto mode as well.After doing a heck of a lot of homework, I decided upon the Nikon D90 and I'm please to say that it has opened up a world of creativity.The Nikon D90 is a terrific and intuitive camera to use - especially when you're not in auto mode.  The menus make it easy to move through the different features and you have easy access to spin wheels at your right forefinger and thumb that control different functions depending on what you see in your viewfinder or menu.  I have learned more about how to alter the depth of focus, the crispness of live action, and to use out of focus backgrounds to complement what is in the foreground - all by playing with the Nikon D90's aperture settings, shutter speeds and the like.  Knowing how to do these things really opens up a world of creative opportunities even for the amateur photographer like me.  These are the things that are impossible to do with a point and click camera - and cannot be done with an SLR in auto mode.I must add, however, that while Nikon made an incredible tool in the D90, their operating guide does leave a lot to be desired.  I highly recommend you pick up a guide.

I especially enjoyed the wide angle that it provides even though this camera is only 1.6x!I have added a sb-400 to this camera and my flash photos are much nicer than the built-in flash but i'm not saying that the built-in flash is bad at all. Actually, the built-in flash will probably work for most of photo enthusiasts as it creates respectable flash photos in it's own right.The coloring of the photos look much true to life than the Canon 40D i have. i have compared the same photos with the same exposure and to me and my wife the photos from the D90 just looked so much natural. I guess this is due to the 12.3mp sensor that it borrowed from the awesome D300.HD videos are in good quality. I have shown them on my Samsung 1080P TV and they looked very nice except that they are in Mono sound, this is the only downside of this feature, but hey this is the world's first DSLR that can shoot HD and i know that we can make pretty creative videos using other Nikkor lens but at this time i just don't have the funds to do so!In conclusion, this is a very reasonably price machine and it's quiet affordable for the everyday photo armatures and enthusiasts.", "Date": "December 15, 2008"}, {"Title": "Well worth the money", "Author": "Johanna M.

I have to go into iPhoto or Photoshop CS3 to boost saturation, reduce exposure, and increase sharpness.  Auto mode must seek slower shutter speeds for shots as there is constant subject movement blur even set at 320+ (yes, I know I can shoot in shutter priority mode, but I'm old and lazy).  My D70 actually performs with better picture quality (although it now has to go back to Nikon for a recall because it won't read its CF cards periodically).  The D90 went back to Nikon after 33 days as I received two errors: the blinking \"F--\" which means no CPU lens attached (although using the 18-105mm kit lens) and the auto focus cuts out periodically.  According to Nikon, there is a communications problem between the lens and body. I'm not satisfied with Nikon's digital quality.  I have three other film Nikons including a Nikonos; two Hasselblads; and a Linhof Kardan 4x5\" and never had a problem with any.  Thankfully, AAFES is replacing it even though past the 30 day grace period.Glad I didn't spring for a D300 or D3 ....Post Script:  Returned the D90 kit to Nikon for replacement.  Found out today Nikon intended for me to pay more for the replacement kit as there had been a price increase since the purchase.  It took a while for AAFES to choke Nikon into understanding they can't keep a person's camera and ask for a price increase.  Is Nikon the GM and Chrysler of the photographic community?Post Post Script:  New D90 kit arrived today.  Shutter opens very delayed from depressing release; stays open after the basic exposure: as in hangs up. Panning during an exposure at 1/500 sec results in VERY LONG, cute horizontal lines where the picture should be.  Nikon Tech Spt says send it back for repairs ... after less than 3 hours in my possession.  Two for two bad D90s out of a population of two.

I've sent the lens back twice already - after taking it to a Nikon certified camera store for them to check the lens (as suggested by Nikon tech support)...the store said there was definitely a problem with the lens.Even after returning the lens twice for repair, the focus problem keeps getting worse. Now all I can shoot with is the long lens and in manual focus. I was told after the second lens return that the camera body would need to be sent in next if it wasn't correct.

I have used digital point-and-shoots for years and have always tried to take great pictures. We've always gotten Canons and been very happy. I used to have a Canon PowerShot S2. That had 10x optical zoom and was a heftier camera. Using that (and using it till it wore out, actually) was what convinced me that my next step should be a dSLR. I researched it extensively, and wasn't sure which to get until I heard that Nikon's new D90 would have video capture, something I was loathe to give up with the point-and-shoot.At that point, it was simply a matter of getting over the price (I had been looking at the lower entry-levels). I was compelled by the arguments of Ken Rockwell  that the D40 was more than most people need. True enough, and you will need to judge your own purposes in your purchase. As my intention is to develop photography into a hobby and I would like to be able to use it to make a little money on the side, I didn't want to get a camera that I would outgrow in a couple months.I have been extremely happy with this camera. Now, much of my reaction I'm sure would be to any dSLR camera and discovering the many things I could do with it over a point-and-shoot. I love the speed - it focuses very quickly and then takes shots as fast as you can click the button. I know this is a general dSLR feature, but wow, I was blown away at how great that was. The camera itself is just plain sexy and a joy to use. The LCD is brilliantly clear and bright. The controls are logical and simple. The ergonomics are great (another reason I wanted the larger mid-level model over the D40; this is a lot easier to hold, if heaver).I could not be happier with my purchase.", "Date": "September 29, 2008"}, {"Title": "magnificent product - a big leap forward from my canon xt", "Author": "A.

After studying reports, handling different cameras at the local retailers, and talking to acquaintances about their cameras, I decided on the Nikon D90 with the 18-105 VR kit lens. I also purchased the 70-300 VR zoom lens in anticipation of the wildlife that is prevalent where I was going. It took me a couple of days to become familiar with the features and capabilities of the camera, which are very impressive. The controls and menus are intuitive and the 3\" Hi-res viewing monitor is a joy to work with. The results on the trip more than met my expectations. The vibration reduction feature of both lenses worked well and my hand-held shots were crisp. The one aspect of the purchase that is less than stellar is the Nikon software program supplied to organize and view the photos.", "Date": "September 27, 2009"}, {"Title": "This camera lives up to all its expectations", "Author": "D.

The learning curve of this camera is definitely not for a beginner, but the Auto modes do help quite a bit.  I've realized just how many different ways there are to royally mess up a photo!The kit lens (18-105mm) is suitable for most situations, but lacks the length to really zoom in on something far away.  Macro shots work nicely with this lens, as do portraits and landscapes.  Fireworks were no problem with a tripod, but shooting a wedding hand-held at dusk/twilight was too much for the slower f/3.5-5.6 lens, even with VR turned on.  Had to use a flash as it got darker.My next purchase will probably be a 50mm f/1.4 prime lens for faster shots and more crisp portraits, then the 105mm Micro-Nikkor for macro shots.", "Date": "July 15, 2009"}, {"Title": "Can't go wrong with Nikon!", "Author": "P.

It's also a great camera for a pro to use as a back up. The image quality with the 18-105 lens is brilliant and is as good if not better than it's big brother the D300.I gave this camera only 4/5 stars is because of three reasons. First, the weight. It's definitely one of the heaviest cameras in it's range. The Canons are so much lighter. Second, the battery lid is flimsy and looks like it hasn't been fixed properly. I don't know if this is the case in all their cameras or only mine. Third, it's quite expensive when compared to it's competitors. It would have been nice if this camera had been priced about 150 - 200 dollars lesser than it's current price. Do get it with the Lowepro Slingshot AW 100. It compliments the camera very well.

And I have never taken another roll back to them, VACATION PHOTOS AT THAT. So when Digital Slr's started coming out, you can bet I bought me one, a Pentax ist DL about 5 or so years ago, sold it to my brother, who gave it to my Sister and brother in-law, and I bought a Nikon D40 in its place, then a Canon Rebel XSI after a year or so. then within six months of that bought a Nikon D60, then decided I would much rather have the D90, and proceeded to trade the D60 and XSI in, kept the D40 (centimental reasons) and I now have a Nikon D40 and a Nikon D90.Now what made me choose a D90? simple The HUGE 41 Custom Menu was a plus for me, 2nd the rave reviews of the picture quality, 3rd would have to the Low Noise up and down the ISO range, even at 6400 is good. 4th I would have bought me a Pentax K7 because of its huge improvement in WB mode, and other ares, but after looking at pictures from the K7 vs. pictures from the D90 at ISO 3200, no explanation was needed as to which was the winner, the D90 of course!I have compared cameras from Canon 40D and 50D and the Pictures seen at High ISO, Pentax K7, Sony A700, and each time at the High ISO 1600 or higher the D90 seemed to always win. However, I think the closest Competition for the D90 would be the Sony A700 as it seemed pictures were good at High ISO 1600 or Higher, BUT ONLY AFTER Sony done a Bug fix on the Camera with the Latest Version Upgrade V4.

I enter this review with mixed feelings. I received my Nikon D90 around Jan 4th this year and was instantly amazed with its ability. Because of my previous experience with the D50, it did not take long to get accustom with the D90 and was quite surprised at the ease of familiarizing myself with the new camera. I did try to read up as much as possible because I feel that is the most importand thing to do in photography, knowing your camera inside and out. For the first two weeks, I would say it performed beautifully,as expected. However shortly there after I began noticing pictures that were grossly underexposed speradically through a shoot. I shoot sporting events indoor with various lighting. Here are my usual settings. ISO-1600 to 2000 with High ISO NR on,WB-K at various settings depending on lighting, burst and single exposure modes, AF area mode-Dynamic area,Center focus point-wide,Meter-Center weighted. I shoot approximately 200-400 photos over a period of about 3 hours with several breaks throughout the session. Photos in question are almost completely backed out but look as though they are very underexposed with just hints of the subject on the outer edges. These photos will be scattered about the shoot so it has been very difficult to pinpoint exactly what might be going on to cause this but I have been very surprised with that this is happening. The last session, I had about 25-30 of these misshots in a little over 400 photos. The Customer Service Dept. has been very gracious and helpful to try to resolve this problem and after talking to Nikon USA and Amazon Support, I have a new camera being shipped as a replacement. I am very pleased with this as I feel like it is a defect with the camera and did not feel like this problem should be showing up this soon. The D50 never has had any problem like this but it does not have the setting capability that the D90 has, so I will not try to compare their performances. I hope the problem is with this particular camera and not the model. I am a Nikon fan and will continue to be but this is a discouraging chapter in my history with Nikon products.

It is rarely today that I am so impressed. But this Nikon, as pleasing as some of the great cameras of the past, compels me to recommend it to you.The central attraction for me, a picture taker not a camera operator, is the ease with which I can make great shots having very few settings to deal with. Night shots are outstanding, and this an inbuilt option on the function selector makes such things very easy to do.! No fiddling or tweaking needed nor required. Consider what used have to be done to get such shots.Like another camera that I still use and love, Kodak Z710, I can opt for PASM shots if I want to experiment, and on the Nikon D90 DSLR the results instantly displayed on the large screen on back making corrections very easy.But for those of us not into fiddling with such settings, preselected set-ups for the most popular shots are built into the D90, all set out on a function dial on the top of the camera. These are, Auto, Flash-Off Auto, Portrait, Landscape, Close-Up, Sports and Night-Portrait as well as PASM.Which brings me to the supplied 18-105MM DX VR AF lens. Very nice for the price offered here, and it surprises with every shot, all of which are good! BTW.Even though the quick start booklet is very well done, newbies to DSLRs will get more out of the larger user manual. In particular that warns against fiddling - even accidentally BTW - with the focus ring on the lens when the lens focus selector is set to auto.Buy the remote control - it lets you operate the exposure button when your camera is on a stand and you are the other side of the room!Nikon ML-L3 Wireless Remote Control for Nikon D40, D40x, D60, D80 & D90 Digital SLR Camerasand a lens cleanerNikon 7072 Lens Pen Cleaning Systemas well as an SD memory card.Sandisk 4GB Secure Digital SD HC Memory Card (SDSDB-4096, BULK, No Reader)and at least one filter to protect your investmentTiffen 67mm UV Protection Filter", "Date": "December 11, 2009"}, {"Title": "So far, so good!", "Author": "Amanda \"Amanda\"", "ReviewID": "RNLOEV88PY4XM", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "This camera is amazing.

Souza", "ReviewID": "R2O8D79WX85ALM", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "The D90 is my first foray into the realm of D/SLR photography and it's largely been a joy thus far. I think the standard kit lens offered for this camera is a good choice for people like myself in that it provides some room for growth and discovery and some basic methods to go more hands on (zoom and manual focus ring), as is the whole point of venturing into SLR territory.  The camera itself isn't as daunting as it might first appear, since the central control scheme built around the main and sub command dial is an intuitive interface.I could be happy strictly with the JPEG output of this camera and how the Picture Controls allow you to set that output.  It can produce sharp, accurate pictures they way I like them while also providing for a full gamut of control over hue, saturation, sharpness, etc.  With the nice, large LCD and some basic tools built into the camera for post-processing (like crop and straighten), I've found myself willingly using these tools for on-the-spot post-processing more than I ever have with similar tools on point and shoot cameras. But, as I've started to dabble with the RAW format, it's hard to deny that the much deeper post-processing capabilities in a \"digital darkroom\" like Nikon's own Capture NX software aren't alluring.  It's a shame though that Nikon doesn't include the full Capture NX software for their DSLR customers and sells it separately at significant cost.  At the price the D90 goes for, I think Capture NX should be included as part of the package.A few other minor issues prevent the D90 from a perfect review for me.  The contacts between the kit lens and camera have been fickle for me, often requiring lens reseating to dismiss an annoying \"F--\" error message that prevents picture taking until resolved.  It's the first camera I've owned to corrupt a flash media card (and a nice high speed 4MB card, no less) - it only happened once thus far and there's no way to be sure that it was the camera and not just a bad card but the first is the worst, as they say.  Finally, in the time I've owned the D90 and having gained some familiarity with the features offered in the rest of the Nikon line of DSLR, there's certainly a few missing that I wish the D90 had.  Interval shooting, for example - that one is at the top of my list.But none of that changes the fact that the D90 has successfully converted me to the world of digital SLR photography, happy to be here.  It's small foibles and omissions aren't enough to distract from its inherent proficiency as a robust photographic tool and its overall build quality.

and an 80-200 one-touch Nikkor lens. No tripod or monopod were used. Watch for the venetian effect of the lamp post, I think is caused by the rolling shutter (which is the culprit in the jello effect of objects bending side to side when the camera shifts back and forth)The video can't display the image quality since they only allow 100MB or less.Pros:Good tweaking of white balanceSDHC cards getting cheaperSetting so ISO adjusts in-cameraRun and gun between video and still shootingCons:Camera compresses video too muchMono microphoneLow-quality audio recordingLack of microphone jackLack of manual control in D-MovieJello effect when panning; Venetian effect when shooting bright objectsOnly 5 minute maximum clips per recordingI wanted to try this camera to see whether it can record on-the-fly even though it has only a built-in microphone and no input jack. I wrote Nikon and talked with two reps before they unveiled the D90 about those concerns but they seem not to have a plan to upgrade any time soon. Yet other cameras like the Canon 5D and Lumix GH1 have mic jacks. It's clear that video needs sound, which is the most important thing; if your sound stinks, it can make video unwatchable.  So I now want to sell the D90 and try the Lumix GH1.", "Date": "May 23, 2009"}, {"Title": "I knew it was used, but I thought it came in perfect condition", "Author": "Daniel Malave \"Lambaiker\"", "ReviewID": "R2R4BXT1IWKF5O", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "Camera does not recognize SD card, compartment memory card is bad.

This sensor is bigger than the one in a camcorder so the movie function is more clear than a camcorder. It captures more light if you want to see the evidence for yourself go to the nikon usa website. They have comparisons there. The pictures have a clarity I never could get with my compact and if you shoot in raw you can use with capture nx2 which is the nikon software to do editing and fixing. I love nx2 as it gives that perfect look to my shots. The video function does not have autofocus and I believe it will come in the next generation but I couldn't wait.

Unfortunately the Video just does NOT work well.  Unless you are rock steady while hand holding the camera, you will get jumpy and distorted videos.  Even while using a very good tripod you will get mixed results.  Also the Video focus does not always stay locked on, so you can start in focus, and then lose it. Plus, if you are shooting Video in brite sun, it's often hard to tell if the focus has gotten locked because it's difficult to see the Video Focus lock indicator on the screen.  On the plus side, I really like the new INFO button that puts the data on the top screen of the camera on to the rear screen at twice size.  It's great if you need glasses to read the top screen. Also the rear screen is larger than the D80, which is very nice.The Camera has a mini HDMI output, but mine didn't come with a cable and they are tough to find right now.

Por mucho es la c\u00e1mara m\u00e1s recomendada para fot\u00f3grafos principiantes y aficionados, y en realidad que es una EXCELENTE c\u00e1mara! yo la amo! La calidad del sensor acompa\u00f1ado de la incre\u00edble \u00f3ptica hacen de esta c\u00e1mara algo realmente asombroso. Aunque los men\u00fas son largos tambi\u00e9n son muy intuitivos. Algunas funciones resultan faciles de usar y ofrecen resultados increibles... Puedes incluso crear men\u00fas personalizados! Luego de revisar el manual, la c\u00e1mara resulta realmente f\u00e1cil de manejar... el resto lo hace el buen ojo y el gusto por buenas escenas. Adem\u00e1s, por ser una de las c\u00e1maras m\u00e1s famosas y vendidas en su tipo, existen muchos cursos, foros y libros que gu\u00edan el trabajo con la Nikon D90. Tambi\u00e9n existe una buena gama de accesorios y juguetes para usar con tu Nikon D90.La construcci\u00f3n de la c\u00e1mara es c\u00f3moda y luce hermosa, tiene much\u00edsima presencia! El cuerpo con el lente que se incluye son algo m\u00e1s grandes y pesan un poco m\u00e1s que c\u00e1maras como la Canon EOS XS o la Nikon D3000, pero nada que no se pueda soportar.En cuanto a la calidad del video, considero que es muy buena... de cualquier manera, no la compr\u00e9 espec\u00edficamente para grabar video, pero seguro esta funcionalidad es algo que agradecer\u00e9 a pesar de no soportar Full HD.Esta es definitivamente una de las mejores compras que he hecho en mi vida!!! Si alguien desea dar un paso adelante en la fotograf\u00eda aficionada, no lo dude, esta c\u00e1mara es la respuesta... y realmente no es costosa.RECOMENDACIONES (si me lo permiten):Complem\u00e9ntala con algunos accesorios. El control remoto es genial y de seguro resultar\u00e1 \u00fatil en cualquier momento. Tambi\u00e9n h\u00e1gase a una memoria de buena capacidad (16 GB m\u00ednimo) y a una bater\u00eda adicional porque con esta c\u00e1mara ser\u00e1 inevitable querer disparar todo el tiempo. Proc\u00farese un buen morral/maleta/bolso para la c\u00e1mara y los lentes, porque a pesar de su construcci\u00f3n robusta es algo delicada y digna de proteger/cuidar. Tenga un buen kit de limpieza para la c\u00e1mara y los lentes, ah! y un filtro para proteger los lentes.

My initial review was posted under the D90 Nikon kit (18-105 mm lens) review site, but now it is appearing under the D90 body only review site. I exchanged the 18-105 mm lens and the \"F - -\" and \"ERR\" messages have almost dissapeared. They have occured only twice in almost a year. The camera is great and the price has gone down over time. My new rating is 4 stars. I still think that noise reduction is overplayed a bit.

After unpacking the camera and the lens, I found that both of my hands & shirt cuffs are having black dirt marks.  Later I discovered that the black dirt was come from the rubber shell of the camera & lens.  May be the chemical composition of that batch of rubber materials had problems, it seems that the rubber is aging.  I wondered why I spent such amount to buy a mid-range camera set, but the shell quality is so bad --- no quality control for such kind of precision equipment.  That means their quality assurance is questionable in Thailand.  I will not buy any Nikon products produced in Thailand in future.  Actually, I am a Nikon fans, I had several cameras & lens at home all of them are Nikon, as I trust their quality in the past (made in Japan). But this time a little bit disappointed.2.) Another thing, the 18-105mm kit lens mount is in plastic which is no good for long term use, and may not be durable. This is my first time to buy expensive camera lens in plastic mount.  But I am not sure how long it will last without problems.3.)

As a result, most of the software you have probably won't work. Not only do you need the newest versions of Photoshop or Photoshop Elements if you're using Adobe products (ok, Nikon might argue that's Adobe's problem, but then, they provide no support to Adobe) - but wait, even your own Nikon software may not work at all! Neither the older Nikon Capture 4 photo editing software nor the relatively new Capture NX can read files shot with your D90!  Nikon's technical support say there's nothing they can do about that and I should buy ($180) or upgrade ($100) to the newest version, Capture NX 2. In my case, all I'm using my Capture software for is to de-fisheye pictures taken with Nikon's 10.5mm lens, which worked well with my previous Nikon cameras.
