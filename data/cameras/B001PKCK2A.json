{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Fantastic upgrade to those 35mm film disposable underwater cameras!", "Author": "Kara", "ReviewID": "R2I6LKLS4PO4PR", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Just got this camera, and so far find it to be a fantastic value. I was drawn to this camera by it's price and megapixel size (of up to 8.1). This price I got it for is very competitive with similar cameras of lower 3-6 megapixel ranges (I snagged it for about ninety dollars).But please do keep an eye on the prices because I've seen the price on this change very frequently (in a matter of minutes) and vary about $15, since I started writing this review.Why else did I get it? I'm going on a trip to the Bahamas in August and don't want to take 35mm underwater disposable cameras with me. Airport X-ray machines can ruin the film if it's in your carry on (since most of those cameras use ISO 800 film) and that's the only luggage I plan on bringing. So I wanted to take a digital camera since I'll be snorkeling while I'm down there, as well as have it not get ruined if it fell off a kayak or it started to rain. I'm too terrified to try one of those underwater pouches for my primary camera (a Samsung S700) due to lack of reviews on the pouch-type it would require and fear that if it got ruined I'd be out my favorite camera so I've opted for this camera and so far I am SO glad I did! Vivitar seems to have fit a lot of nice features into this point & shoot camera.But if you're looking for a professional camera, let me stop you right now and tell you to look elsewhere as this probably won't be anywhere near your expectations. This is by no means considered a professional camera. However, if you're looking for a better option than a 35mm underwater disposable... then it CERTAINLY provides better results than a 35mm film underwater point and shoot camera. I say this with experience from using those 35mm film underwater disaster cameras but from also working in a photo lab where I've seen the vast majority of what those cameras produce at water parks and the Caribbean... and the Vivitar Vivicam 8400 camera is by far so much better.I tested it in my friends pool yesterday and it had no leaks around the gasket/closing mechanism and the pictures were surprisingly clear! I will add some sample photos to the product gallery as soon as I get some I'm willing to share with the public at-large. Overall, I give it a 4 out of 5 and that's because I'm nitpicking.Pro's:- Water resistant up to 30 feet!- Supports an external SD memory card in up to 8GBs in size! This was great for me as I already have plenty of this type of card from my other camera. And this type card is generally inexpensive compared to other size cards. Just to give you an idea of storage capacity I put a 4gb SD card in the camera and it said I could store 1596 pictures at the highest 8.1mp setting OR 1 hour 37 minutes and 15 seconds of video! Obviously, you can do a combination of each if you switch between the modes.- Uses AA size batteries. I've been using energizer rechargeables in this and got a decent amount of life from them from STEADY non-stop use. My suggestion would be to use the photo lithium or the rechargeables as I'm sure that just like all other digital cameras on the market, that they would probably suck the life out of the cheaper basic alkalines.- Reasonably large LCD screen on the camera at 2.4 inches.- Can record photos AND video.- Comes with an adjustable wrist strap so it's easy to secure to your wrist--however, should it come off your wrist the bright yellow color of this camera makes it easy to spot to retrieve unlike the blue model.- Sinks somewhat, so you won't have to deal with too much resistance to keep it staying underwater.- Has the screw hole on the camera's base for mounting to a tripod.- When powering off the camera it clearly displays \"Bye-Bye\" on the LCD screen.- Easy 1 touch \"Mode\" button to switch between capturing still photos or video.- Lightning bolt button easily lets you change from auto-flash, flash (for all photos), or no-flash.- Can take photos with Super Fine, Fine, or Normal settings.- Although the camera is 8.1MP, you have the choice of shooting photos in the following resolutions  (8M, 5M, 3M, 2M, 0.3M)-This can be great if you're limited on how much space is on your memory card.- You can adjust the white balance in Still Photo mode OR in Video mode. It defaults to \"AWB\" (auto white balance) but if you know how you're lighting will affect your photos you can change it between Auto, Day Light, Tungsten, Fluorescent, and Cloudy.- There are 3 Color Effect options to shoot photos in: Color, Sepia and Monochrome.- There's the option of changing the exposure setting from (-2.0 to +2.0): -2.0, -1.5, -1.0, -0.5, Auto, +0.5, +1.0, +1.5, +2.0- It offers a Self Timer of either 10 seconds or 20 seconds.- Date stamp is optional.- A \"Burst Snapshot\" feature allows you to set up the camera to take 3 continuous images as you move the camera.- Video's are recorded in *.AVI format which are compatible with most Windows type movie-maker programs (ex: Windows Movie Maker, Corel VideoStudio, and many others)- You can change the resolution of the video recording from 640x480 or 320x240. AND change how many frames per second it records (15fps or 30fps)- You can \"lock\" the pictures you've taken to prevent them from being accidentally deleted.- A Rotate option allows you to rotate photos taken at a 5M resolution or lower, on the camera.- English not your primary language? No problem. There are 7 language options to choose from on the submenu: English, French, German, Italian, Spanish, Portuguese and Chinese.- You can set the light frequency from 50Hz to 60Hz.- The beep/buzzer sound on the camera isn't annoying loud, but you can disable it if you'd like.- Comes with a USB/TV-out cable so that you can play back your photos on the TV or even take photos or video's while hooked up to the TV! Just use the USB cable provided, plug the small end into the camera and then the yellow jack to your yellow jack on your TV, and then turn on the camera! (I've never had this feature before and I think this is awesome!)Con's (and most of these are me nit-picking):- There is a very apparent shutter-lag. The image you THINK you took will freeze on the screen after hitting the shutter for a couple seconds but in actuality it captures your picture about 1-2 seconds later and the actual captured image will flash on the screen for about a 1/2 second.- It does not capture photos well at night or in dark areas.- The locking/closing mechanism on the camera for the area where the SD card and battery compartment is feels a little cheap to me. I think a better material could have been used than plastic clamp/lock. So I would advise closing and opening it with care. You have to push a small black arrow right first to release the long plastic lever, pull that lever all the way down, and then the hinge will release to open the compartment for the batteries, SD card slot, and USB connection.- Buttons on the camera seem a little stiff to press down on, this is probably due to the type of engineering required for this type of cameras purpose.- The Vivitar 8400 is a little larger and heavier than my Samsung S700.- There's no lens cap to protect it when not in use.- No separate \"delete\" button function. If you want to delete a picture on the camera during playback mode you have to hit the \"OK/Menu\" button and navigate to the delete option.- After taking a picture, there is very little delay and it disappears very shortly off the LCD screen so there's no time to check it. You have to use the playback mode.- No sound on Video recordings which I think is a bummer given that the lower grade model-though priced higher (seen here: Vivitar VIVICAM-6200W 6.0 MegaPixel Underwater Camera with 4x Digital Zoom 2.0\" LCD) had the sound in its video recording option.- No regular viewfinder like on standard cameras so that you don't use up battery power with the live-view LCD screen. And the screen can be somewhat difficult to see underwater.- When switching from auto-flash, flash (for all photos), or no-flash mode using the lightning bolt sometimes it \"hangs up\" and gets caught switching and the screen will go blank and a blue light beside the screen will flash.- The Rotate option does not allows you to rotate photos taken at the highest 8M resolution, on the camera.- The 61 page user manual is on the CD that comes with the PhoTags software. I realize this is a greener alternative but I would've liked to have had it already pre-printed.- The Photags Express software is not compatible on Macintosh computers.- Does not come with batteries.***UPDATED*** 09/07/2009I just wanted to update you all on my experience with this camera in the Bahamas... and quite frankly, I think it worked out great during all 6 days of snorkeling and swimming! And would still give it 4 stars! NO LEAKS--Even after opening it every night to access the hub in the camera so I could play the pictures and video back on the TV using the video cable that comes with the camera and re-closing it! I used Energizer Lithium AA batteries in it and did not have to change them at all the whole trip. I've added a few pictures from when I went snorkeling to the customer gallery... and one of the great reasons why I still think this was better than a 35mm underwater disposable... I took some great video as well!  (I'll add a compilation of video clips I shot to through a \"video review\" as soon as I figure out how to). However I did want to make some tips/notes for potential buyers or current users...TIPS & NOTES:DEFINITELY preset the white balance before entering the water or taking ANY pictures! It makes a big difference as to how your pictures and video will turn out. Do not trust the \"AWB\" aka \"Auto White Balance\" feature. I found that on sunny days that should be shot under the \"daylight\" white balance setting would appear blue-ish if you used the AWB setting.YES the screen can be difficult to see underwater, HOWEVER I was able to see the screen enough on a bright sunny day where the water was pretty clear and easily switch between video and picture mode. The cloudier the water is, the harder it was to see in general and of course distinguish what was on the screen--not to mention, when the water is cloudy, you can't expect pristine pictures--that's just silly to expect that.Do not attempt to take pictures of anything less than 3ft in front of you as you are guaranteed to get a blurry/out-of-focus picture. The fixed focus on this camera is just not designed for pictures that close. Take your picture 3ft away for a clear shot and then crop it later. The camera has digital zoom-not optical zoom so you're not going to gain any quality advantage to zooming when taking your picture vs. cropping it later. At least if you don't zoom in, if something moves you have a greater chance of still capturing it.How to play back VIDEO in the playback mode: Once you've found your video clip on the playback screen press the shutter button like you would if you were taking a picture. This will get the video to start playing back on the screen for you. You can hit the shutter button again to stop it.In VIDEO mode: Be sure to hold the camera steady and move it SLOWLY underwater when you're in video mode. Otherwise the video will probably make you feel sick when you play it back later as it will seem like it jumps all over the place.Make sure you rinse the camera well with salt-free tap water after bringing it in the ocean. The salt can crystallize in parts of the camera later making it difficult to close the camera's memory card/battery hatch without risking breaking the hinge. If you close your camera gently and visually inspect the closing latch on the side to make sure it is completely down and the \"#1\" arrow latch is to the left, so that everything is lined up where it's supposed to be... I don't see why you'd end up with leaks.The pinch clip on the wrist strap to tighten it around your wrist has shown some signs of rusting internally. However, it still works well at tightening.With all that said, if you're looking for a more thorough technical review, I'm sorry--just not an area of my expertise.

I took about 30 photos first time out and was able to achieve results good enough to post on my blog. The reason so many reviewers get blurry shots, and the trick to taking good photos with this camera is simple (though a little annoying). There is a very long shutter lag time from when you push the button to when it takes the actual shot. However, and this is the annoying part, there is NO lag time from when you push the shutter button and when the screen freezes the image. So when you push the button the screen freezes immediately although it has yet to take the picture and you must wait for the screen to go back to live motion to know that the picture has been taken. The first couple of pictures I took I would begin to lower the camera just after the screen froze and that would be when it would actually take the picture thus making it blurry shot from my quick hand movement. So when you use this camera and want good results, push the shutter button, the screen will freeze and THEN the shot will be taken and the screen will go back to live motion. Enjoy, it's a good one, just have to get used to the long shutter lag.", "Date": "August 1, 2009"}, {"Title": "Leaked water", "Author": "Ray Man", "ReviewID": "RFAH4EA1VKUIS", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "Given that the camera leaked water and died on my second day of snorkeling, I consider my 3-star rating to be extra generous.  I've returned the camera for repair/replacement under the terms of the warranty.The photos that I recovered from the 1st day were pretty good...certainly better/more convenient than using a disposable camera.  The video quality is also decent, though there is no sound recording, which is fine for most underwater videography.  Considering the camera's low (tempting) price, the photo & video quality were just about what I expected, if not a little better.  A negative is that it is somewhat difficult to use underwater: the view screen is hard to see, and the image of the photo you just took remains on the view screen for barely a second.  On land, I found some of the functions non-intuitive (such as reviewing and deleting images), and the camera sometimes \"froze,\" requiring me to turn it off and on again to reset.Overall, I find the ViviCam 8400 serves as a relatively inexpensive, moderate upgrade to disposable cameras.  If it hadn't leaked water and died on me, I might have even give it 4 stars given the low price.  I'll be interested to see if other reviewers experience issues with water leakage.UPDATE (March 2011):  My rating has steadily dropped.  It was a huge hassle to get a replacement camera from Vivitar.  First, they sent me an incredibly cheap NON-waterproof camera (total junk).  After much pestering, I finally received a replacement.  Looking past the fact that the camera leaked water, I'm surprised I was so kind in my original review of photo quality.  Don't be fooled by the 8 MP specs; photos look more like they are taken with an old-school 1 MP camera and are often blurry.  And that's on land!  I thought I might have bought a lemon originally, but the replacement has the same problems, often freezing up...very frustrating and annoying.  My new recommendation: if you want a toy for your kids, this might suffice.  But if you're hoping to take nice vacation photos, look elsewhere and be willing to spend a little more.  I'm looking into Intova products, which seem to combine quality at a good price.", "Date": "June 24, 2009"}, {"Title": "Important Information", "Author": "Jeremy Davis", "ReviewID": "R16BJL4H9VMGPJ", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Ok so I read alot of review and I bought this camera and there are basically 3 important things you need to know.-The First is that this is a camera that goes under water.  you have to take care of the seal.  I work on multi million dollar sub for a living and the one thing that is always true with anything that goes under water it's that it needs a greased seal.  No matter how good your O-Ring you need to keep it from being Dry. This camera has 2 major seals that  you have to take out and grease up.  I recommend Dow 111 Silicon gel  it's available for $16 and comes in a tube that will last for about 1-5 years of use. compared with the cost of a new camera thats dirt cheap.  Alternatively you can use Vaseline or most any marine grease.So you will want to open up the the data port on the side and remove the seal in there and set it aside.  You will want to remove the the door that held the seal to get at the other seal.  Simply push the hinge pin up and out of the door and set the pin and door aside.  This can be done with a jewlers screw driver or a metal coat hanger.  Now remove the 8 screws on the back of the camera and lift the back off of the camera.  Now just remove the seal you find in this cover.With the 2 seals out all you need to do is smear a thin film onto the seals and reassemble.  you want a wet look but no clumping.  You will want to repeat this with the small in the data door before ever dive, but the lager seal won't need clean and re-greased more them once every 6 months or so.With that don't you should be leak free as long as you own the camera.--Second you have to let it air our.  This one is simple but you won't think of it on you own.  When you put the camera away after a dive leave the camera open.---Third and this one is my only complaint.  This camera has a fixed focal length.  That means that you have to be about 4 feet away from what ever you want to take a picture of, or it will be out of focus.", "Date": "September 25, 2010"}, {"Title": "Couldn't be worse!", "Author": "LLPD \"LLPD\"", "ReviewID": "R1YG4BDUIS4CH4", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "Please note that this is the same as the yellow Vivitar 8400, and see that the one-star reviews dominate.  I saw the bad reviews, but I gambled and bought this horrible camera.  What a joke.  We never even got to use it, because after turning it on the screen would go grey after only a few minutes and it would freeze up - couldn't even turn it off.  This camera wasn't a lot of money, but we wound up on our tropical vacation with no underwater camera!  Please be smarter than me, and notice that the most common ratings for this camera are for only one star.

Then I noticed that the battery/SD card compartment door was not properly seated.  I have diagnosed the underlying problem as poor design with respect to the battery compartment door locking mechanism.  There is a single release button which stands proud of the surrounding surface.  If it is bumped or brushes up against your wrist it can easily release the locking lever on the battery compartment door.  The locking lever is spring-loaded to pop up into a position where it is easy to manipulate to complete opening the battery compartment door.  But it appears that, even with the locking lever only partially raised, the watertight seal will have been broken allowing water to enter the camera.A good solution might be to have two relase buttons rather than one and for both to be recessed so that they are not easy to release accidently.  The locking lever should also be redesigned so that it does not automatically pop up into a semi-opened condition.If you already have one of these cameras and have not flooded it, I suggest that you try electrical tape over the release button and the locking lever as a way to prevent accidental opening.  If Vivitar replaces mine (it goes in the mail tomorrow), that is what I am going to try.", "Date": "August 31, 2009"}, {"Title": "Leaks within 10 minutes of water entry", "Author": "Gary Droubay", "ReviewID": "R3U6BHM4ZI40ZY", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "Very unhappy with this camera.

The controls on the Vivitar are completely different from any other digital camera--and I've owned at least a dozen different digital cameras over the years.  The controls are baffling: multiple pushes of cryptically-labelled pushbuttons are required, and, over time, the pushbuttons start to stick in the \"in\" position.  Then what are you supposed to do?  Pull them out with tweezers?  While you're swimming?I would say look around here on Amazon and buy just about ANY other underwater camera that you can find.

I bought this camera to take on a trip to Hawaii where I planned on snorkeling.  The deciding factors were the price, depth rating, and video feature.  I read the Amazon reviews, and following the advice of some of the more knowledgeable reviewers I inspected and silicon lubed both O-rings to ensure a positive seal.  I used a lithium battery to ensure long battery life.  Finally, I carefully reviewed how to shut the battery door (it's best to download the full manual on line).  I went snorkeling three times, and the camera was in the water fully immersed for several hours at a time.  There were no leaks, the battery lasted all week, and both pictures and videos came out great.  Some minor contrast and lighting adjustments help them \"pop\".

I got it at a clearance price of around $50.  I've had it around a year and so far it's worked good.  Before you consider the quality of the photos to be junk understand how underwater photography works.  Things are a LOT different and light changes a lot under water.  In a swimming pool not as much but in open water (lakes, oceans, rivers) water is not as clear.  The first color you lose as you go deeper is red.  This affects your photos and is NOT the camera's fault.  The high end cameras use special filters and color correction programs to fix this issue.  Also the high end cameras have the strobe (flash) off to the side at a 45 degree angle which is the best for underwater (you ALWAYS use a flash underwater even on sunny days to help with colors and photo quality etc).  This camera has the flash right above the lens which is not ideal.  This is a good camera for a great price.  Like anything else, you get what you pay for.  If you want photos with quality good enough for National Geographic then this is not the camera for you.  Most of the water leaking issues can be prevented by inspecting, cleaning and lubricating the O-ring seal.  Even though it's only rated to 30 feet I've taken it routinely to around 45 ft with no problems.  Had I paid $600 then I would be very disapponted with the functions and photo quality but considering it's low cost, it's well worth it.  Disposible cameras are around $12 and then you have to pay developing fees.  So even if you only use this camera a few times you break even.  Considering water proof housings for non-waterproof cameras are between $150-$200 this is a great deal.  I would buy another one even if this one wears out at some point.", "Date": "May 29, 2012"}, {"Title": "Didn't work from the minute we got it out of the box...", "Author": "SwimMomWV", "ReviewID": "R2YIAUB4AYI8JX", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I got this camera for my daughter.

But if you are used to pointing and clicking, you'll get your picture.Also, it is slow to take pictures.  But I didn't find it interfering in taking pics.I would advise anyone on the fence about this camera to give it a try....I'm glad I did.

Every day we would start our day in the ocean, then hung out at the pool in the afternoon. It was great to take photo's above water but hanging by water. I had no worries about people dropping it in. We did Tubing, Hot Spring Bath, and when it rained I didn't worry either. All the photos came out awesome! Some photos were a little blurry from fog on the lenses. I would wipe it and it would be fine. The downfall to this camera is you need a steady hand. Yet if camera was wet it didn't really matter how steady your hand was. It has no zoom. The Flash takes forever to take a photo and by the time it took, the person or animal would have moved so it made a blurry photo.

But if you want to get some pictures with your kids and the family without worrying about your nice dryland camera and not deal with those cheap disposables that limit you on how many pictures you can take, and then you have to get developed before you know you have maybe 3-4 good pictures, then this camera might be for you.I purchased this camera for your my wife who is avid scrapbooker.  Even though she would purchase them on sale, she was constantly getting disposable underwater cameras, that she would then have to get developed.  This was the perfect alternative.Pros.  The best things about this camera are in its' name.  Its an 8 Megapixel underwater camera.  Supporting SDHC, so you can fit a great deal of pics on to one card.  It seems to be good on battery life******ASSUMING***** you use the right batteries. In any digital camera or device we use, we use the Energizer rechargables, and get great life.  And with their 15 minute recharger, you are rarely out of service for long.  Although in a pinch, it's nice that you can pick up any AA batteries to use.  But I'm sure it would eat through normal alkalines in a heartbeat.Cons.  There are a couple little caveats that you have to deal with.  This camera is SLOW to take pictures, so it is best for set up shots.  And sometimes that can cause a bit of distortion with your images.  But as long as you don't move until the image in the viewfinder flickers and is back to showing everything live, you will be fine.After reading another review, they were absolutely right about the White balance.  Don't use the Auto, if you set the white balance, your pictures will come out so much better, yes that makes it a bit less of a point and shoot, but in the end it's a small price to pay.Overall, it's a nice little camera for the price.  Especially for the weekend scrap booker or the family memory maker.  No you won't be doing a professional photo shoot with it, but you will probably pay for itself in a couple trips to the water.  If you count the cost of the disposable cameras and development versus the amount of good pictures you get.

I bought it used for $60, but I have heard that it is possible to get it cheaper nowadays if you shop around.Pro's:User-friendly and easy to learn.  Very waterproof if you are careful about the seals (i.e., make sure to lock battery case tightly, keep hair/dirt off o-rings, etc.)  Takes good pictures and waterproof seals were very reliable. Another GREAT pro: it's waterproof to 60ft, which is unusual in the market of cheaper waterproof cameras.  Most go to either 10 or 30 ft, but this is a better dive camera because of it's depth capabilities.Con's:It's heavy.  An antiquated \"brick\" style, it's bulky and there seem to be better, lighter cameras out there these days for a similar price.  (However, like an old cell phone from the 90's, it may be bulky but it sure was reliable!) Another con is that it does not have a very efficient \"automatic\" setting for UW shots.  You need to get into the water and manually program the white balance according to the amount of sunlight in the water before proceeding with your snorkel trip or dive. Finally, thing thing sucks battery life like a camel at a watering hole with a big straw.  You will need spare batteries for a 2-dive trip.Overall, I really liked this camera.  It's now an old model, but I found it to be a good camera for its era and very affordable for what you get.

Disney water rides!  now remember it is an underwater camera so its a bit bulky but not by much compared to some digital cams out there, I can still put it in my front jean pockets or side cargo pants pocket...  I also use energizer rechargables and shut it off after each shot until ready for the next one, and it will last you a bit, if not go for the super lithium energizer digital ones and you'll get your $10 bucks worth in pictures.  the more you open the back the more risk of getting water in it!

I have brought it on two canoe trips (one to Moosehead lake in Maine and the Androscoggin river in Maine, an ocean trip up in Winter Harbor, and have used it when it was pouring outside. Normally I try to baby my gear but with this camera (as it was not that pricey) I have been a little more rough on it. While canoeing down the river we dumped and everything went into the water. The camera did freeze initially that is why I am giving this a 3 star rating rather than any higher...but as soon as I got it home to see if I had lost any of my picture or whether they would come out at all, I was surprised to see that not only had they come out but they were pretty nice pictures (not as nice as my regular camera) but overall good.The only issues I have with this camera is that it does not float and sometimes the lens can fog/ water-fy the picture meaning that it creates a reflect/refraction in the picture...like if you were to drop a water droplet on a print out of a photo and it distorted-kind of.Overall I would say that is worth the 100 bucks if you are just doing small water trips and want a camera that you don't have to develop pics with or worry if it gets banged up.", "Date": "September 13, 2010"}, {"Title": "Better than a disposable waterproof camera", "Author": "RRmom", "ReviewID": "R22I4NPDNMQSOB", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "I wanted a cheap waterproof camera that I could take with us on vacation.  We were going to an indoor waterpark, so I needed a camera that had a flash (which I could not find in the disposable waterproof ones) and I didn't want to spend a lot of money-just in case it was stolen. I was hesitant to purchase this one after reading the reviews, but I found it at Wal Mart for $80 and decided to give it a try.  Let me start off by saying that the outdoor shots I took turned out pretty decent.  I got a few really good indoor shots, but most of them were somewhat blurry-I do have 2 active kids, so I don't think that helped.  In my opinion, I'd rather have blurry shots than no shots at all.I did take 1 or 2 pictures underwater, but they didn't turn out because my child wouldn't stay under long enough.  The camera did go underwater several times, but only for 30 seconds at a time, so I can't really report on how it does for extended periods of time under water-ie: snorkeling.It did not leak as some other reviews mentioned and it's still working.  I still have the original (disposable) batteries in it and they haven't run down yet-I took approximately 90 pictures in a 2 day period.It does have a 1 or 2 second delay once you hit the button, but you just have to learn that you can't move the camera until the live screen is back up.  This really is not a big deal-I don't think.  Also, don't expect to take rapid photos with this camera.The flash really is not that good, but it's obviously better than not having a flash.Don't expect to use this as an everyday camera-it's a good substitute when you're going to the pool or the waterpark and you want to get pictures without worrying about ruining your good camera or having it stolen.The quality of the pictures is definitely better than a disposable camera, but in no way are they professional quality.The camera is also fairly easy to use.", "Date": "July 26, 2010"}, {"Title": "Vivitar vivicam 8400", "Author": "Reid N.

It comes with a tiny getting started guide which tells you to get full instructions on their web site.  Can't do that from a boat, and unfortunately the buttons and operations are not at all intuitive.  Even worse however, is that the camera failed after 20 pictures.  Water did not leak in, but it stopped showing images on the screen, stopped taking pictures, and oddly, wouldn't turn off.  The screen glowed a dull blank glow with no image, menu items or instructions.  I had to pull the batteries to shut it off, and when I put them back in I got teh same dull glow.  New batteries did nothing.  I was able to download the pictures and a few were OK.

It's larger and heavier than a regular digital camera, but I guess that's to be expected.However, what I did not like is the long 'lag time' in taking photos. I'm talking about maybe 5 seconds here between pushing the button and the actual picture capture. For a camera designed for sports and nature action, that seems an unacceptably long time. This may be good if one is setting up for a still shot in a damp condition, but for use in a white-water rafting trip or canoeing, this is a 'deal breaker'.  I never could get the 'burst' feature to engage.The second drawback is that while it is advertised as a 'waterproof' camera, the packaging boasts 'water resistant'. NOT the same thing.Third: totally inadequate for night shots.  When using the flash, the recharge time is about the same as  the shutter speed -- about three to five seconds. During that time, the screen goes blank, and the flash ready light (a blue light on the left of the screen) flashes. The flash is only good for about two feet. Everything else is in darkness. There is no scene setting for night or low light photography.I would not recommend this to anyone seeking a camera for outdoor, water related action photography.

I resorted to taking as many photos as I could in hopes of getting a few good ones as I could not see what was in the frame.I had to turn the camera back on several times.It was a pain having to focus on keeping the camera on instead of enjoying what I was doing.The lag time was killing me. I had tested the system before going on the trip with a standard SD card. Once I saw the lag, I tested a SanDisk Extreme III card from my SLR which is quite a bit faster when used with a Digital SLR. In this camera, it made no difference. I missed several good shots due to the lag.Once I got home, I was supprised that I could not pull the photos directly from the memory card and I had to use the USB connector.Overall, this is an OK underwater camera for less than $90.
