{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Innovative camera with lots of features but lacks in key areas", "Author": "Polar Bear", "ReviewID": "R1BHFRE9300UEM", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "The new Casio TRYX has so much potential with some really cool features but unfortunately falls short in some key areas.PROSThis is a SUPER thin camera (.59 inches thick) that looks sleek and modern. And, because of the way the frame rotates, taking pictures from any angle is simple and easy. You can position the camera anywhere, whether it be hanging from a wall, on a table, or anywhere else you can think of. You can also use the body as a tripod and rotate it take perfect self portraits while actually seeing yourself in the LCD frame. It comes with a self-timer that can be activated with the touch screen LCD; one great feature of the self timer is that it can also be triggered with a built-in motion sensor. You can use your finger to designate an area in the frame of the LCD where it will monitor for motion. When motion is detected in that area the self timer is triggered, letting you take pictures of yourself or with a group of friends with ease.This camera has 12.1 megapixels, and the images it captures are stunning! There are dual core processors built in, so processing speed is insanely fast. And there are a multitude of features which allow for almost unlimited creative endeavors. For example, Slide Panorama lets you take 360 degree pictures easily. And the HDR-ART technology allows you to transform any photo with the press of a button. This allows you to combine continuous shots with different exposures and lighting to change the contrast and color saturation. The result are some incredible images which really pop off the screen.Another great feature is you can take full HD 1080 video at 30 frames per second. You can rotate the body to make it feel like a traditional camcorder and use either a left or right handed grip. Plus, you can record in slow motion, which is something I've really enjoyed doing.The TRYX comes pre-loaded with software that makes uploading pictures and video to facebook, YouTube, and other internet sites easily. You can preselect which images you want to upload in advance, and it automatically sends the files to each location upon connection to a computer.Figuring out how to operate gadgets like this is not an easy thing for me. I am what many consider to be technologically impaired. But the touch screens are so intuitive and simple to use that even I was able to easily figure it out and was up and running in no time.CONSThere are a few major downfalls with the camera that are potential deal breakers.  The lens is a fixed focal length, which means the zoom is digital only. As far as I can tell, it's a higher then average quality digital zoom that seems to maintain image quality up to 2x the original size. That being said, I really wish they would have included optical zoom as this allows you to get much closer to your subject with better quality pictures. Being able to zoom close into your subjects is something that I really miss.Also, there is no flash! Taking pictures in dim lighting or at night is, quite simply, not an option.Finally, the video camera only records in mono, so having stereo or surround sound is not an option.Overall, the TRYX is a nice camera with some cool features, but lacks in some key areas which may make you want to consider another option.", "Date": "March 31, 2011"}, {"Title": "Pretty good camera", "Author": "Mr. Wonderful", "ReviewID": "RIA7WYWAX3G92", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I actually really like this camera...I am not by any means a professional photographer or serious hobbyist but I do like to carry a camera for general picture taking and for that it has exceeded my expectations. The touch screen has perfect sensitivity in my opinion; not to sensitive and not feeling like you have to pierce the screen. The camera is built very well...even with the screen capable of moving in 4 different directions the camera feels very solid, it doesn't slip out of place and there aren't preset positions that it has to click into to keep from moving when out of the normal position. I particularly like the screens moving capability. If you unfold it to a parallel or just less than parallel line you can have both hands spread about 10 inches or so apart giving you a feeling of more stability. The zoom isn't so great but lets be honest...for the people who are buying a camera like this the photos they are taking are going to be generally close range during social situations, if you are the kind of person who needs a telephoto lens for your pictures none of the cameras on the market like this are for you. I really like the HDR capability it has...again if you are a pro who needs 10-15 stops for their HDR images than go buy a 10 thousand dollar camera capable of that...I believe this camera is capable of 6 stops, so a lot better than most other cameras in this range. If you want to get the image quality of a Digital SLR camera then go buy a Digital SLR camera don't buy this one and expect the same images you can only get with a several thousand dollar camera.  This camera is lightweight, well built, has cool features, has a lithium ion battery, very very skinny, sleek camera that is really great at doing what it was designed to do: allow the 99% of the people who use cameras and aren't professionals a highly portable really cool camera with some great features.", "Date": "April 13, 2011"}, {"Title": "Great point-and-shoot", "Author": "S. L. Trafton \"Sue Lynn\"", "ReviewID": "R1PDVIS77NK2M", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I love this camera. It is very small- about the size on an iPhone. It takes great pictures indoors and outdoors, day and night.  It has an LED flash, but it doesn't need to a flash to take pictures, even at night outside if there is even a little light. I like this a lot because I really hate how weird and unnatrual a flash looks with some point and shoot cameras.  The auto and premium auto modes are really good for easy, low-key photography. The touch screen is pretty easy to use. If there is any complaint, the battery life is not spectacular.  It would probably need to be recharged every couple of days on a vacation. Take note, it also does not have an optical zoom - digital only.  That being said, I think the camera does a wonderful job performing the jobs it was designed for and the photos come out great.", "Date": "May 12, 2011"}, {"Title": "Gary's Review of the Tryx", "Author": "Gary's Review", "ReviewID": "R27M37UHA4U09H", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I've had Casio's Tryx for about a month now, and love it! Others have written about the absence of flash and optical zoom, but I don't need either of these items. They would also add to the size, and destroy the small, sleek design.The wide angle lens and sharp 12 MGP stills, as well as the 1080p HD Video make it the perfect device to carry everywhere - which I do.The new octopus-style design is perfect for snapping images from every possible angle, and uploading to Flickr and YouTube is a snap. I also like the Monet-style Photo Art function.I'm pleased to give this gem a five star rating, and would highly recommend it to others.", "Date": "May 30, 2011"}, {"Title": "great", "Author": "Puying Zhou", "ReviewID": "RMEQFHIBX8B2F", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "my wife loves this camera very much, it is very easy to use and the picture is not bad. it can be amplified for any size because of its 12mp large cmos.", "Date": "December 4, 2011"}, {"Title": "Just for Fun", "Author": "Jun Sohn", "ReviewID": "R2K2BTJU3VUASY", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I purchased it from here in Amazon warehouse deals for about $160 very good used.And I say this camera is worth the money.It is the best phone camera... Yes.. it is not your camera for professional use... nor a compact camera with all around zoom... but it is just fun to bring in every occasion. Great camera for self portrait and with friends. Like the camera on your phone... but better...I've read people saying smartphone with apps will take better pictures... well...what do you expect? your smartphone is way more expensive. I'm not saying it takes worse pictures... in fact, it does take better quality pictures.Don't expect too much from this camera. If you are like me... like to hang out and take pictures with friends and have fun.. you will like it.If you want to be an artist, you need something else.there are 2 things that I don't like about the camera... battery life is short and you cannot replace the battery... no spare...and touch shutter just takes unwanted pictures all the time... I guess I better get use to it.overall, I like this camera... it is always with me.and FYI, Casio is one of the first company which made the compact digital camera.", "Date": "July 21, 2011"}, {"Title": "Tryx Cam", "Author": "BJB1", "ReviewID": "RNGYRAMRWL1YM", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "If you're looking for a really good (simple) 12 MP \"still\" camera, then this is the camera for you.

Missing some key features for me!", "Author": "Oslek \"Amazon all the way!\"", "ReviewID": "R1X7XAYTHV3HV0", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "I have been a fan of CASIO EXILIM cameras for a while now.  Since I purchased my first one, I have bought at least 3 different ones (as new models were launched).  I was so much looking forward to this new TRYX model!  I pre-ordered it from Amazon and received today.  I tried it and it feel sturdy, strong camera.  The pictures are very  good, but yet this is something I usually expect from Casio cameras. The camera overall is awsome, the idea is excellent and the concept innovative!  Great little piece of electronic.The negatives I found (and reason why I will not keep it): lack of optical zoom and lack of flash!  To me, these are basic, essential features that I can hardly live without.  I would love to keep this camera, but it would mean that I still have to keep my old one for situations when flash is needed and this one for those that don't.  Double the work for me!I am so sad because I so much wanted to like and keep this camera... But unfortunately, I think I need a camera with flash and better zoom.I guess I just have to wait and see what else Casio comes up with!", "Date": "April 7, 2011"}, {"Title": "Poor buy poor controls", "Author": "GEORGE E. NEWMAN \"gadgetpudit.com\"", "ReviewID": "R5BT9FAA5H93X", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "Pass on this camera.  It originally caught my attention because of a promissed HDR feature.  High dynamic resolution (HDR) allows a photographer to snap the same image several times at different exposures so in a high contrast situation, such as a darker room looking outside to a bright window, all of the photograph (once merged) will look much more as the human eye does.The HDR in this situation appears to be done with a software adjustment.  The results are terrible.  I have seen better results from an iPhone.  Furthermore, there is no tripod mount and its \"touch screen\" controls work about half the time and not even all that well at that.  I can not even say that the camera is convenient.  It is as if the manufacturer did not know that touch screen devices were already on the market.Aside from the slick package, there are no redeeming qualities for this camera.  I am not even impressed with its HD Video.  I would suggest as an alternative, any Canon or Nikon cameras at or near the same price range.  I am, personally, a Canon fan, but have seen some impressive results from the smaller Nikons as well.Sorry to be so harsh, but IF you want to look at this camera, see one IN PERSON and play with it before you make up your mind.  I am confident that you will find It a waste of money at any price.", "Date": "April 17, 2011"}, {"Title": "this is the last camera you'll ever need to buy", "Author": "john f furlong", "ReviewID": "R2N1IPSOJR5SNB", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "TRYX has tricks in it that will entertain you and your friends for sometime.Everyone thinks I'm an artist and all I did was touch the button.Casio TRYX Digital Camera with Full 1080p HD Video Capture and 3-Inch Touch Screen LCD (Black)", "Date": "November 13, 2011"}, {"Title": "good camera! worth!", "Author": "Ka Kit Mak", "ReviewID": "R14ME4U8IJLD94", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "It's awesome to use it to take pictures for yourself, especially for girl.My girlfriend love the camera.
