{"Reviews": [{"Title": "the best gets better - perfect balance of size, speed, photo quality, capabilities", "Author": "Paul Christensen \"gadget geek\"", "ReviewID": "R1WW8G6GZ0G3IP", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Last year, after extensive research, I bought a Canon A540 to replace my trusty Olympus D40-Zoom. My goals for camera selection where (a) compact size, (b) standard AA batteries, (c) full manual controls, (d) outstanding image quality, (e) speed, (f) optical viewfinder. The A540 fit the bill almost perfectly, with a handful of limitations that I noted in my review.This year, with Canon's release of the A570IS, I decided to upgrade, driven by the addition of optical image stabilization (IS). While the IS is impressive, I was surprised by other improvements that Canon has made. Image noise levels are significantly lower and more controlled for higher ISO captures. The Digic III processor seems to make more intelligent decisions about lighting and flash exposure, especially when its face recognition is engaged. Add a dramatically better quality LCD screen, slightly higher 7.1MP resolution, improved case, and support of high capacity SD cards, and I doubt I'll need to upgrade any time soon.Like the A540, the A570IS is for me a perfect balance of size, speed, and photo quality. The A570IS is the same physical size as the A540. It's small enough to fit in a coat pocket or small belt case yet uses 2 AA batteries.Like the A540, overall processing speed is very fast unless you're taking flash pictures (and then you should expect about 4-6 seconds between flashes depending on battery level and what flash strength the camera selected). Note that flash time is significantly better with high-capacity rechargeable NiMh batteries than with standard AAs. And, unlike some other cameras I have tried, the speed of the user interface (especially during playback) is very fast.Picture quality in general is excellent, even in low light situations. Noise at higher ISO is significantly more controlled than the A540, perhaps a benefit of the new 7.1MP CCD and the Digic III image processor. According to the documentation, noise reduction is applied at slow shutter speeds of 1.3 seconds or greater, and this can slightly slow down shot-to-shot time. There is no option to disable or adjust the noise processing, but in my experience the results are very good. When noise reduction is applied, there is a slight loss of detail compared to the A540, but the results are noticeably better on the A570IS with its built-in noise reduction than post-processing noise on pictures taken with the A540.In my own head-to-head comparisons between the A570IS and A540, the A570IS has better light metering and noticeably sharper detail on indoor shots without a flash (especially when image stabilization is engaged). The A570IS does favor slightly higher ISO in auto modes than the A540, giving generally better results without a flash. However, when taking close-up pictures with a flash, the A570IS doesn't seem to select anything lower then ISO 200, sometimes requiring a manual ISO override in Program mode.The A570IS offers a new ISO 1600 mode, but I'm not quite sold on it. Without a tripod, under low light conditions, ISO 1600 does offer the opportunity for blur-free photographs not possible with ISO 800. But the level of noise and artifacts from the noise processing don't give a very usable picture.The A570IS raises the bar with optical image stabilization, which only works when the camera is held horizontally. One of the biggest limitations of consumer digital cameras is the need to hold the camera steady to get a clear shot. At higher zooms and in night shots this problem can be compounded. I've taken a number of shots with and without IS, and it is useful but not a \"magic bullet\" for poor shots. Small details like far-away signs at night become clear when the IS is engaged. You can set the IS to run continuously during preview, only when the shutter is released (slightly lower battery drain), only on vertical movement (better for objects that are moving horizontally), or disabled (I have yet to find a reason to do so). And, unlike many cameras I've seen, the IS works in video capture mode.Like the A540, the A570IS offers full manual controls. With the A570IS, Canon adds two more modes (Kids & Pets and Indoor) to the mode selector wheel (instead of having to find them on the Special Scene menu). The A570IS also adds a new Aquarium scene mode, while removing the useless Color Swap and Color Accent modes. Canon has also removed the \"My Camera\" customization menu (for changing the startup picture and various sounds) which I never used on my A540.Although I never expected to use it, the movie mode is excellent. It's still not a replacement for a dedicated camcorder. But I have used it on a number of occasions to capture audio and video when a picture just won't do. Standard movie mode is 640x480 (VGA) quality at 30fps, but you can raise the capture to 60 fps at 320x240, or lower it to 15fps at 160x120. The A570 can now capture video up to 1 hour or 4GB whichever comes first. Video files are very large (around 1.9MB/second at 30fps) but they compress extremely well with QuickTime Pro's MPEG4 codec.With the A570IS, Canon also addressed some of my minor complaints about the A540. Most notably, the LCD screen is much higher quality and higher resolution. The case plastics seem more solid, the small rubber door covering the USB - A/V - power ports pivots open from the side not the top, and the handle area no longer has a chrome insert which had a tendency to fall off. The ring that covers the conversion lens adapter mount has a chrome trim, making the camera more attractive but at least on my A570IS it is more difficult to remove than the A540.Once again, I looked at the Canon A710IS which offers a 6x optical zoom, but has the same 7.1MP sensor, optical image stabilization and user interface with the older Digic II image processor. In the end, after trying both cameras in the store, I again settled on the A570IS. The A710IS is noticeably larger (about 0.25 inches wider and slightly taller), and the more complicated lens takes longer to startup and to zoom. Both cameras have a limited number of stops in their zoom range, but this is noticeable on the 6x of the A710IS where it is not noticeable in the 4x of the A570IS. For me, the larger size wasn't worth the extra zoom. And the benefits of Digic III are impressive.In summary, Canon A570IS Pros:- 7.1 megapixel sensor, 4x optical zoom- ISO 80 to 1600- optical image stabilization for higher ISO or zoom, even during video capture- optical viewfinder for shooting with the LCD off- full manual controls (shutter priority, appeture priority, full manual)- preset and custom white balance control- outstanding photo quality, even in relatively low light (good color balance, very low noise at higher ISOs, almost non-existent chromatic aberation)- Digic III processor offers face detection, makes more intelligent decisions on exposure, and flash levels- very good results from built-in noise reduction for slow shutter speeds of 1.3 seconds or greater- very fast startup and shot-to-shot speed (flash not withstanding)- excellent and speedy auto-focus even in low light (although the AF assist light can slow this down)- orientation sensor recognizes if you have rotated the camera to take a shot- flash adjusts angle based on wide-telephoto zoom- built-in red eye reduction during playback lets you select an area to remove red eye and save as new or overwrite the existing image- surprisingly usable movie mode- outstanding user interface: options are well laid out and easy to locate, very well thought-out record and playback options- extremely fast user interface and playback performance, even zooming in on photos- high resolution LCD screen- well built case, very comfortable grip- uses SD cards and supports high-capacity SDHC (takes advantage of high-speed SD)- uses 2 AA batteries (at least 2500 mAh NiMh rechargeable recommended)- very good battery life (approx 400 shots on 2 rechargeable NiMh AA, with the display on)- replaceable lithium battery protects settings when changing batteries- supports optional high-power flash, conversion lenses and underwater caseCons (to me, all very minor):- flash recharge time is acceptable but not great (4 - 6 seconds between shots using NiMh batteries)- preview display blanks while flash recharges- Auto ISO for indoor flash close-up pictures doesn't seem to select below ISO 200;  you can force ISO 100 in Program or manual modes- ISO 1600 is of questionable real-world use because of noise and artifacts from noise reduction- noise reduction cannot be adjusted or disabled- it is possible to insert the SD card upside down and you don't realize until you try to close the cover (would be easy to break the cover if you force this)- the markings for the battery orientation are difficult to read- no RAW image support, but you can select from 3 different compression ratios for image quality- bundled 16MB card is useless - buy a 2GB cardTIPS:1) make sure you do a low-level format before you use your SD card in this camera, even if you had formatted it for another Canon camera. It makes a significant difference in shot-to-shot speed2) always use high-capacity (2500 mAh or greater) NiMh rechargeable batteries - the flash recharge time is much improved (though still 4-6 seconds)3) for indoor flash close-up shots, may need to override ISO to 100 for better quality4) for outdoor shots in bright sun, setting exposure -2/3 gives better control of bright areas5) if you use the conversion lens adapter, don't plan on using the built-in flash which is partially obscured by the adapter. I haven't tried it, but would expect the external flash to not have this problem.", "Date": "March 29, 2007"}, {"Title": "The best digital camera I've owned.", "Author": "William Kasting", "ReviewID": "RC5TWLPDPIDNB", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I've had this camera for about a month now and have taken well over a hundred photos in different settings ranging from indoor birthday parties to outdoor hunting photos of dogs.Overall,  this is by far the best digital camera I've owned.  Previously I've used a Sony DSC-W5 and Nikon Coolpix L3  -- all were in the $200+ range.Shutter lag on this camera is minimal.  I've missed many pictures of my dogs in the past because they've run out of frame during the time from when I pushed the shutter button to when the camera actually took the shot.  I've not had that problem at all with this camera.  Using the kids/pets setting, it uses a fast enough shutter speed to stop the action as well.I also like the Shutter Priority priority mode as well.  It allows me to set whatever shutter speed I think is necessary for the shot, and the camera takes care of everything else.  It flashes a warning if I have the shutter set too fast for available light.Other useful features I've noticed making a difference is the \"face recognition\" technology and the \"Image Shake\" reduction.  There are lots of bells and whistles on cameras that I do not use,  but with these two I have had very few bad pictures.The flash has FAR better coverage than the Nikon.  I frequently had shadows at the edge even when the subject was fairly close.  While not as good as a separate hot shoe flash on a SLR,  this flash is the best I've had on a compact digital.Finally, I love the optical viewfinder!  I take many photos outdoors in bright sunlight that can be difficult to frame with any LCD screen.  The viewfinder is a lifesafer in those situations.  It is easy to compose a photo and so far they have turned out perfectly when using the camera this way.This camera has tons of features that I have not mentioned.  I just listed those most important to me and the way I take photos.  I would highly recommend this camera to potential buyers.", "Date": "July 19, 2007"}, {"Title": "Excellent camera", "Author": "JerryWithaJ", "ReviewID": "R3NYYULKJRQS2S", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "My current camera is an Olympus SP-320.  You can read my review on that product page, if you wish.I like the pictures I take, but I'm no pro and there is always someone whose pictures I admire more.  I have one friend who consistently takes great shots.  When a bunch of us attended a wedding last summer, there was a vibrancy to her shots that mine couldn't quite match.  Since she swore by her Canon Power Shot, I thought I'd give the A570IS a chance.  This weekend I had both the A570IS and the SP-320 with me on a weekend jaunt and took half of my pictures with each camera, swapping back and forth between the two.Both cameras use two AA batteries.  Both have optical viewfinders.  Both have more modes than the casual picture taker will ever need.In my hands, the picture quality is almost indistinguishable.  In some settings I prefer the Olympus; in others, the Canon, so the A570SI is going to be returned since I'm well within the return period.  However, if I had the option of returning the Olympus, too, I'd keep the Canon.  Here's why:* The Canon is slightly smaller.  The bulge on the Olympus makes it harder to find a suitable case.* The Canon's mode selector dial clicks firmly into place, unlike the Olympus's which is very loose.  The Olympus's dial often moves when the camera is removed from its case.  Not so, the Canon.* The Canon has 4x zoom compared to the Olympus's 3x.  Also, the digital zoom is better implemented in the Canon.  The Canon stops at full optical zoom.  If the zoom slider is released and reengaged, the digital zoom is applied.  This is true even in Auto mode.  The Olympus's digital zoom is not readily available in every mode.  When digital zoom is available or turned on, it lacks the Canon's pause at the end of optical zoom.pause.* The A570IS uses a standard mini-B USB connector rather than what appears to be a proprietary type for the Olympus.None of these--or even all of them together--are enough to make me keep the Canon and put the Olympus up on eBay or Half, but they'd be enough to get me to pick the Canon if I didn't already own the Olympus.", "Date": "April 15, 2007"}, {"Title": "Lens problem and the pros don't outweigh the cons for me", "Author": "RCH", "ReviewID": "RXLJKD0UGX6T4", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I purchased this camera as a travel camera to take on an upcoming trip.  My other camera is a Nikon D80.  I read lots of reviews for the Canon point & shoot cameras and decided to give this one a try because of the image stabilization.  This is my first Canon camera since my old 35mm Canon Snappy.  I've taken it out on a couple of shoots before our trip.Pros:*  Very small and light, easy to carry around.*  Takes regular AA batteries which is great if your rechargable  batteries run out of juice during a trip.  I do recommend buying high quality rechargables though.*  Produces very vivid colors which equal great photos.*  Has image stabilizer which is a very nice feature in a camera under $150!Cons:*  The time it takes to get ready between shots with the flash is waaaay too long.  By the time it is ready again, the moment has passed or the subjects have moved on or changed their expressions because of the long wait...\"oh hang on...just a minute...stay right there...\"  That doesn't work.*  Very close to impossible to see the screen in sunlight (even with a glare reducer/protective film).  No problem one might say, there is a viewfinder...see next con...*  The viewfinder is not true to what you actually take a picture of...useless if you are zooming for sure!*  No battery life indicator that I have found.I wouldn't buy this particular camera if I had it to do over again for my needs.  I also had a problem with it right out of the box (an apparent spec of dust is inside the lens which requires shipping it to Canon to be fixed...not a very good start for me with my Canon experience).  The customer service guy at Canon was very nice however.  It should take about 10 days to 2 weeks to get the camera back.  It was purchased to take on a trip this weekend so all of the pictures will have a dust spec shadow in them.  To me, the importance of the cons outweighs the importance of the pros.  Most cameras today do take great pictures.  The viewfinder is basically useless and the screen is too hard to see outdoors.  No matter how vivid and nice the pictures are capable of being, if you can't frame your picture and even make sure the subject is in the picture because you can't see the viewfinder in the light...what's the point?  If you are going to use this mostly in overcast or indoor shots, it would be great and that is where the image stablization comes in handy but then you have to wait for the flash.  If you have to use the flash much, patience is required because you can't take more than one fast.If I did it all over again, I wouldn't get this camera simply because it doesn't fit with my needs.  I'm sure others are very happy with it and that's great.  Hopefully after I get back from our trip and have it repaired, I'll learn to like it too.  I'm a huge online shopper but I would buy locally next time so that if there was a problem (like I have with the lens issue), I could return it directly to the store for an exchange.  I won't purchase another camera from an online store but I will give Canon another try one day.", "Date": "September 17, 2007"}, {"Title": "My First Digital Camera and It's Great!", "Author": "Mark Baker", "ReviewID": "RU2UXG1OCV9A2", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Having finally decided that digital cameras aren't just some passing fad (okay, so maybe it had more to do with other things being a higher priority), I recently bought my first digital camera.  There were several things I knew I wanted, and this camera fit the bill.  I'm really glad too, because I love it.I was looking for a camera that took AA batteries and had a viewfinder.  Most everything else was secondary.  This camera had both of those as well as 4x optical zoom, 7.1 mega pixels, and image stabilizer.  As soon as I knew about that feature, I had to have it.  I am notorious for taking slightly shaky pictures.  This feature automatically adjusts for some shakiness.  And it has done a great job.Basically, I just wanted to camera that I could use to snap pictures on vacations or while out with friends.  I didn't need anything fancy.  And this camera does a wonderful job of capturing those moments.  The pictures are mostly clear, and I'm willing to take the blame for the bad ones.  The camera could be a little smaller, but there seems to be a trade off - bigger camera if you want AA batteries.  It's super easy to download all or just the pictures you want onto your computer as well.Considering I probably won't upgrade my camera for quite a few years, I wanted to make a wise choice.

The only superior cameras I could find were all relatively large and heavy SLR's.  This PoserShot model has most of the features and perfornance of any of the best digital cameras, including an unexcelled image processor, an optional optical viewfinder, face detection, 4X optical zoom, and image stabilization.I have used the camera for about a month and taken hundreds of photos, mostly in the \"auto\" mode, although there is almost no limit to the available settings.  Unfortunately, many of these settings need a navigation of the menu system, which must be studied in advance of any serious shooting.  I have found that the \"auto\" mode is uncannily capable of producing images that require a minimum, if any, Photoshop editing. This is no doubt due to the latest Canon image processor which, among other capabilities, usually produces an \"auto levels\" image with great automatic white balance, and excellent colors. Perhaps the most stringest test I gave the camera was to take several hand held photos using 4X optical plus 4X digital zoom of the home plate action at a major league baseball game from a seat at the top level of the stands.  These 16X images were quite usable, even showing the baseball leaving the bat.While there are a number of competitive cameras in this size range, and even smaller, very few have an optional optical viewfinder that is essential under sunlit conditions.  I also own such a camera, but was totally frustrated in my attempts to use it under these conditions, as it has no optional optical viewfinder.You will not be disappointed if you buy this camera, and I don't have any connection with Canon!", "Date": "July 17, 2007"}, {"Title": "My second Canon Powershot - easy to use, great value", "Author": "A.

Also, they become obsolete very quickly. My first digicam was a Powershot A510 - a solid little camera - and I took several award-winning photos with it. I've used Sony and Panasonic digicams, and have looked at all the other common makes.  At this price point, I haven't seen anything that I like better than the 570IS for features and ease of use.  A real plus is that the Canon controls are well-designed and quite intuitive. I have one at work and one at home. It's a great travel camera, or for documenting field work on the job.  Not as tiny as some, so not the best \"party\" camera, but it will easily fit into my front pants pocket, or goes on my belt with the Canon soft case.

To start with, the screen is much bigger than my previous camera (Canon Powershot A530).  The pictures come out great.  I have tried most of the settings and they work.  (It is going to be a while to try snow because we do not have snow in this part of Texas very often) I live in Galveston Bay.It is also the same weight as my previous camera so it is very easy to carry and transport.

Since I am a teacher (unemployed now) I will not be able to change cameras this year.  However, I still do enjoy enormously the pictures I take with this camera.  I took a trip overseas this year and everyone commented on my camera and the quality of  pictures for such a small and not sophisticated camera.  It is still a winner!!!!After a few months with this camera, I still give it 5 stars. It takes great pictures inside and outside. I am teaching science at a Nature Center and the pictures of the reptiles came out fantastic.  The pictures we took outside of an alligator in the pond shows great details.  For example, I had not noticed there was a turtle taking a ride on top of the alligator's back, but it came out very well in the picture.Shots of my students doing activities are also very good.

Cash", "ReviewID": "R2KPTGXU5FN53Y", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This is a fantastic camera. But to avoid a number of \"problems\" reported in other reviews, consider the following :A) Memory Card : Memory cards are cheap enough these days that one should pony up for a 2 GB card. This will be good for 6 to 8 hundred shots in maximum resolution, minimum compression mode, and thousands of shots when shooting with lower resolution, higher compression. DO NOT get the standard performance card ( often labled 10x ). These have a maximum write speed of 1.5 mb / second, so a high resolution shot could take 4 to 5 seconds to offload to memory. Instead, purchase a medium performance card ( often labled 50x ) that has a write speed approaching 7.5 mb / second.  This should get your maximum resolution shots offloaded in a second or less. The ultra performance cards ( often labled 120x ) are overkill for this camera, but a good candidate for 10 to 12 megapixel cameras.B) Batteries : By all means get a set of 2500 or greater mah NiMH rechargables. Be advised that these batteries do not reach their full potential until they have been through 2 to 5 full charge/discharge cycles. I conditioned my batteries by fully charging them, then discharging them in an old style 2 cell pen light flashlight. By old style, I mean one of those old guys with the large incandescent bulb.Do not use an led flashlight ( too low of a current drain ) or those using a \"grain of wheat\" bulb ( these bulbs have a lifetime of only 5 hours or so ). If you want NiMH that do not self discharge while just sitting around, look to the Sanyo eneloop batteries. Be advised, however, that these have a maximum charge of 2000 mah.C) Charger : I can not recommend the chargers that charge these NiMH batteries in 15 minutes. To do so, they have to pump 10 amps into the little guys, causing excessive heating. This will lead to shorter battery life ...... how much I simply don't know. Get the simple overnight ( 6 to 8 hour ) charger with a set of 4 batteries. This will give you a set for your camera with a back up set when those get exhausted. I use an Energizer 4 cell charger ( $7.95 on sale ) which is 3\"x3\" and an inch thick. Can be packed anywhere.D) Battery Door : Yep .... the battery door can be a challenge when one first gets the camera. But when you know the process, it's a snap. Hold the camera upside down with the lens facing you. Slide the locking tab toward your body and at the same time slide the entire battery cover to the right. Tada ..... its open. And when you close the door, be sure to follow the same procedure in reverse. One MUST do this to insure the door is fully closed and locked.E) False Low Battery indication : There are really two low battery indicators on this camera. The first is the red \"low battery\" icon, and the second is the following message ..... \"change the batteries\". Use the \"change the batteries\" message to change out the batteries. I have found that one can minimize false red \"low battery\" icon displays by :fully conditioning the batteries ( see B above ), making sure the battery door is properly closed and locked ( see D above ), and wipeing the battery terminals with a dry cloth before inserting into the camera. This removes any oil contamination from your fingers.Part of the problem here is that NiMH batteries have a maximum battery charge of 1.2 volts per cell, compared to 1.5 volts per cell for conventional AA batteries. This problem is helped by the Sanyo eneloop batteries, which have a full charge voltage closer to the 1.5 volt per cell value.F) Prevent lens damage : ALWAYS store the camera with the mode switch in the Playback position. This way, if the power switch is inadvertantly pressed when the camera is stored ( storage bag, pocket, or purse ), the lens will not deploy. If stored with the mode switch in the shooting position, and the power button is depressed, the lens will try to deploy and may very well jamb against something in the storage bag, pocket, or purse.Hope these hints help you to fully enjoy an excellent camera.", "Date": "December 26, 2007"}, {"Title": "Chock full of features, won't disappoint - eats batteries", "Author": "Gearhead Mania", "ReviewID": "R2K255HXETYPI2", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I had been searching for a small/compact digital camera capable of aperture and shutter speed priority with the option of full manual control, but one that offered decent optical zoom capabilities and used AA batteries. Sounds like a tall order, but this Canon A570 IS delivered it and then some. The image stabilization works fantastic for indoor shots even down to 1/8th second shutter speeds. The macro quality is also remarkable. However, the LCD viewfinder resolution is sub-par. The optical viewfinder actually zooms when you zoom in versus a traditional optical viewfinder that remains static.The small size and light weight of the camera are major advantages, but it does not sacrifice any of the features. Armed with a 2GB Ultimate SD card, I can take 646 photographs in the max resolution or almost 30 minutes of video footage.I wish the quality of the photographs were better, and that the settings dial had more resistance to prevent accidental switching when removing/inserting the camera into the Canon PSC-65 case.A co-worker had a Canon SD630 that I got to use. She purchased it because of its small size and I guess she had money to burn. I was amazed at its small size, but was disappointed at the lack of features. While it offered 6 MP resolution, it did not have aperture or shutter priority nor did it allow full manual control. I was impressed with the menu interface though. Her camera got me looking at Canons and I eventually settled on the A570IS because of the bang for the buck, features, image stabilization, and the use of AA batteries. I cannot stress the importance of using AA batteries. Modern NiMH AA batteries can have capacities of 2.5 Ah or greater, available in large quantities for little money, and are easily replaceable. Built-in proprietary Li-Ion battery packs will die within 5 years due to the nature of the Ion chemistry and are quite expensive and difficult to replace depending on how it is integrated. As my web-savvy friends would say, \"NiMH AA batteries for the win!\"Short-term use update for 10-24-07:After using the camera for several months I have found a few quirks that would reduce my 4 star rating to about a 2-3 star rating.1). Battery life - almost non-existant. I am using 2.6 Ah NiMH AA's that will last less than 1 week with infrequent use of the camera. My FujiFilm FinePix S5100 uses 4-AA batteries and will easily get about 1 month of infrequent use without a recharge.2). Optical quality - the photos are huge but very grainy and blurred even in outdoor shots. The optics are sub-par and they are just selling the camera based on Megapixels alone.3). Audio recording quality - again, mediocre. It won't record low-frequency sounds that almost any cheap made in Asia micrphone can record, and tends to make everything sound like it is played out of a tin can.Bottom line: Don't let all the features fool you into thinking it is an outstanding camera. At best I would say it is mediocre, but not great.Update:By poor optical quality, I meant that while it is a 7.1 Megapixel camera, don't expect SLR quality photographs. My 4 Megapixel FujiFilm Finepix S5100 produces the same quality image as the A570 IS.Regarding battery life, I found out that the A570IS is VERY sensitive to the type of NiMH cells used in the camera. Do not use low capacity AA cells or else it will flash the low battery icon frequently even with fresh batteries. Energizer 2500 mAh NiMH cells seemed to do the trick as it could handle the high current demand. While a positive aspect of having 2 batteries is reduced weight, the negative aspect is that the cells have to handle a higher current demand. My FujiFilm S5100 runs fine on any type of AA NiMH battery and uses 4 of these cells.1 year later and my A570IS is still kicking strong, but just be aware of the battery issue.", "Date": "August 29, 2007"}, {"Title": "It's A Great eBay Camera", "Author": "HJW \"o8Heather8o\"", "ReviewID": "R22YBC6794NREI", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I am an eBay seller - & this camera is my *Work Horse*...  I got it to replace a $1K Sony Mavica FD95 SLR camera I'd used to get the job done for 6 years.  And this Canon rose to the challenge.  It not only takes stunningly beautiful pictures outdoors in nature (see my customer pictures) with crisp color & sharp focus - it also takes excellent, intricately focused, color true close-ups of sales merchandise in Program / Macro Mode.  The Image Stabilizer feature holds things down nicely so that I can really nail a shot.  The Mavica paid for itself in eBay sales & this camera is well on it's way to doing the same.  To post merchandise I take 100-200 pictures at any one time, every few days with this camera - & it's performance is outstanding.  It's easy to tell from the previews when I've taken a great picture.  I don't open up what look like super shots in Windows & get a bad surprise, as my Samsung S730 is prone to deliver.My first major complaint is, after I take a large handful of pictures where I have to repeatedly adjust the depth of the Zoom -- the camera tends to get confused, loses its ability to focus, & starts taking blurry pictures one after another.  This happens both indoors & outdoors.  Whenever I find its lost its grip on its focus - I turn it off, then turn it back on again, reset my settings, & all is well - until next time.  Restarting it in this way is the only thing that works.  That's frustrating, but it's easy to tell when it's gone off track, & it's a simple fix to get it back in line again.My second major complaint is most of it's outdoor videos run from poor to fair, at best.  My .AVI clips shot across the Lake look like rippling streams of colorful confetti...  Absolutely awful.  The movies lack a certain sharp definitive crispness, both indoors & out.  Breezy days sound like a hurricane.  Voice is muffled.  All of my videos are full of distracting clicks & clacks, because the camera case creaks & groans with every little movement & breeze - *and* - you cannot turn the Sound OFF.  It has better video than similarly priced Kodak cameras I checked out.  But my Samsung S730 wins out over this camera in Video Mode, hands down--so I use the Samsung for my \"cam corder\".  And the Canon for my eBay camera.I would really like to have seen at least SOME emphasis on in-camera picture & video processing - & less technology dedicated to paper photo printing.  I also wish Canon included more unique color settings in the My Colors Menu.  It's not a camera geared toward the creative mind.  I am a webmaster, & an eBay seller... & I'm not into printing piles of paper pictures to store away in boxes & books that take up space... at all.  My photo albums & \"brag books\" are stored on SD Cards.

All that to show that I'm not a complete noob to cameras and picture taking.The A570 IS is pretty much just like the A560. It is actually a little smaller than the A560. The only thing I don't like is the way you review pictures you just took, you have to switch a lever down to the Review instead of having a dedicated review button like the A560 has.The manual controls on the dial (M AV TV P) is nice if you are feeling creative but lazy enough not to grab your DSLR. Getting to the menus is a simple matter of hitting the Func Set button and scrolling through the list. Manual Focus is easily turned on and really fun to work with.The speed if this camera will greatly increase if you use a Rechargeable battery. Point and Shoots nowadays suck batteries in minutes... I highly recommend a Duracell or Energizer 2000mAh or 2650mAh battery. They will last forever and you'll get a decreased flash picture lag. Obviously, you'd get a DSLR if you were concerned about that. So, be aware that if you use normal AA batteries, they'll last you an hour tops or maybe 100 shots without flash before dying.The Image Stabilizer is a nice addition to a point and shoot. It makes it easier to shoot in low light conditions and not get that \"blur\" that is so common. I'm guessing this will hurt battery life so again, highly recommend 2650mAh rechargeable batteries.Only Complaints:These things are fragile so if you drop them you'll be getting another camera. If you take care of your cameras like I do - it will last years.The battery compartment is thin, flimsy, and difficult to shut properly. The trick is to push it down firmly before sliding it in to close. If you do that then the battery door is easy and simple to close.Overall this is a GREAT point and shoot camera. Anyone looking for a cheap camera that takes amazing pictures and doesn't break the pocket book - this is your camera.

In low light on Auto mode, the camera adds enormous amounts of noise in dark areas, and in some cases the pics were way too bright. I did get some pretty good pics by turning the flash off and playing with the manual controls, and it was clear that the image stabilization was helping. Still, that first night I considered sending the camera back for the much cheaper A530.The next day I took some outdoor shots and was totally blown away by the quality of them. Unbelievable clarity for a point-and-shoot, with very true-to-life, vivid colors.Now that I've spent a few days experimenting with the manual controls, I can say that I'm VERY pleased with the A570. If you're just hanging out with friends or family and want decent pics, go with something a little cheaper and smaller like the A530 -- you'll still get great pics in good lighting, and acceptable pics in low lighting. But if you are interested in photography and want more control (but aren't ready for to invest in a DSLR), this camera's a steal.Pros:* manual controls* beautiful photos in good lighting* image stabilizationCons:* unremarkable low-light shots on auto mode* not as small as some point-and-shoots* zoom control is not as easy to reach as most cameras* battery/memory card door is bizarrely designed, and I'm not confident that it will last the life of the camera* some convoluted picture mode choices, like not allowing users to control ISO settings when shooting on Auto -- you have to choose a different mode to get the noise down to an acceptable level in low light. It would seem easier just to make the Auto setting a little more configurable, and have fewer overall mode choices (this is how the HP was -- WAY easier).Nice little bonus: I recently started scuba diving, and the underwater housing for this camera is much cheaper than for many others I've seen.", "Date": "August 20, 2007"}, {"Title": "Red Eye Express", "Author": "digitaldan", "ReviewID": "R1NY8NUQ6RIOT7", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "I have owned the Canon A540 for a year and recently purchased an A570IS as an upgrade.

I bought the camera used, and immeadiately ran into the battery life issue, where after 6 pictures I got the dreaded low battery warning light. Completely unacceptable, so I hit the net looking for a solution, and I found one. The Battery door needs to be locked in order to operate the camera. On the battery door is the connection for the battery, and that's where the trouble starts. The connectors, of which there are two, don't make a solid connection with the battery which causes the problem. The solution is simple and elegant and completely solves the problem. The connectors need to be lifted and the way I did it was to cut two pieces of rubber bands to about the size of a grain of rice. I then used a fine pair of tweezers to place the rubber underneath the connectors. The pressure from the metal keeps them in place. Once done the low battery situation goes away completely.

We have had very few bad pictures and they were taken while kayaking in some rough waters.  The image stabilization does well for the minor shaking a person does while trying to hold steady.  When not using the flash, it is ready to take a picture very quickly.  It takes a picture fast, getting the autofocus done set almost immediately and is ready to go soon as it finishes taking the picture.  The recharge on the flash is average for a camera like this so it shouldn't surprise any one.  It is very easy to use, the buttons are laid out nice, and it's comfortable to hold.  The camera fits nicely in most pockets too.  I would recommend this camera to anyone who wants a small camera but wants to use personal settings that more entry level point and shoots don't offer.

It has a handy belt loop and you hardly know it there and contains enough room to drop a couple of spare batteries in the bottom.I considered the smaller sub compacts but decided on the compact because it uses AA batteries vs. propietary rechargable batteries. Also the controls are well laid out and fit nicely in your hand. After using the camera for several months I do not regret my decision. I found the controls to be intutive and the user manual well written. A feature I liked is that Canon included two manuals, a 32 page basic user guide for all us point and shoot types and a more detail advanced user guide to takes advantage of the more advanced manual settings if you are so inclined.I found little difference in leaving the camera on auto vs some of the other settings in the quality of the pictures which were all excellant. The pictures I took in a cave came out dark and I did switch to Night time mode and they were better. There are a number settings that basicly either adjust the f stop or exposure time while holding the other at a predetermined fixed value.I haven't had the camera long enough to appreciate the difference between all the settings. I believe the average person will do best by leaving it on auto except in very low light condition. I feature that Canon has on its cameras is a view finder, which has gone missing on other brands. Hence the reason I did not consider another Olympus.Without the view finder you have to frame the picture with the screen which has to be on during picture taking and draining battery power. Also it takes away from the moment because you have to position yourself in strong light condition to keeping the screen from washing out as well as hold it at arm's length.

Again, it is not as good as a conventional camcorder, but the results are very good.Adding the right accessories significantly increased the usefulness of this camera for my purposes.  I purchased a SanDisk Extreme III 2 Gb SD memory card.  Using this, the camera can record over 18 minutes of continuous 640x480x30fps video, or over 900 pictures at 7 megapixels using fine JPEG compression settings.I also purchase 2700mAh Powerex NiMH batteries.

When viewed at full resolution, most pictures show some degree of inconsistent coloration at the pixel level (unlike my Digital Rebel pictures).

The right side of the pictures at apertures of 5.6 and larger (wider open) seem blurry, out of focus, and distorted.  It's only about 10% if the image, but it's noticeable even on medium prints (5x7).  Small prints probably not noticeable.  If I stop down the aperture the blurriness goes away (f6.1 or smaller).Other than that I have no complaints.  It can focus great in lower light thanks to the decent AF-assist lamp.  Flash is decent.  It's very responsive to button pressesFlash cycling is very slow (about 8 seconds) but I knew that before I bought it and I'm ok with that, as it only has 2 AAs in it and I don't like using flash much anyway.As far as image quality is concerned, I don't see much in the way of improvement in this DIGIC III over the older DIGIC II processing.  There is definitely lower noise, but this no doubt due to more noise reduction.  For consumers who print images directly from their camera, this is great.  However I'd rather perform my noise reduction in post with NeatImage, so I prefer the DIGIC II processing.I use the 'MyColors' setting with Saturation at +1, Sharpening at 0, Contrast at +1.  This allows me to sharpen in post if I want to, however even without sharpening the images come out acceptable.The White Balance settings are nice.  It can be set manually which is awesome for a camera this cheap.Concerning image quality settings, I forgoe the Superfine and just use the Fine setting.  It looks just as good as the Superfine (to me) while allowing many more images to be stored.I don't know if it was just my camera or they are all like this, but the removable lens ring around the barrel seemed to be loose, and rattled a little.  I didn't notice this on my A710 IS, but perhaps the build quality is lower of this camera (in fact I know it is.  This is a dangerous direction Canon is taking with their more recent products).

That is likely the cause of the so called short battery life some users have reported.As for image shake - read the instruction book and you'll have no problems.  The camera needs some time to compensate so don't just push the button down in one motion. It needs to be first pushed halfway which triggers the stablization and image evaluation.  If the camera determines it can't take an image without blurring it will give you a icon indication to change parameters to avoid blurring.  Otherwise it will compensate.After having this camera for several months I'm still discovering new things it can do.  For the price it is an incredible buy.  Don't let the naysayers regarding battery life, image shake and so called problems with closing the battery door discourage you. The door just doesn't snap shut, it needs to first closed then move the locking tab.Read the instructions and you should have no problem.  However, I must admit it will take several hours of reading to fully understand what this camera can do.Jim", "Date": "January 17, 2008"}, {"Title": "Great basic camera with a lot of studying to do...", "Author": "Frank J.

Using Amazon and DPReview.com (now owned by Amazon) I narrowed my search down to the A570IS as the perfect camera for my teenage daughter. It has a very decent features set, an image stabilized lens, and is considered by reviewers a great value. What is amazing about this camera is the level of control you have--from totally automatic to full manual exposure and manual focus. At 7.1 MP, it takes great pictures but don't expect it to compare to a digital SLR of the same resolution--I compared a mountain landscape taken with the A570IS to my 6.3 MP digital SLR and the SLR clearly wins. This difference would not be noticeable at 4x6 or 5x7 prints but probably would at 8x10.My daughter has been delighted with the camera. At the same time, I bought my wife a Nikon Coolpix L point and shoot camera at about the same price point ($150 at Fred Meyer). It had the key feature of optical image stabilization so I was more tempted than I should of been. Unfortunately, I bought this camera more on the spur of the moment after a very short (for me) research effort. This camera was dreadful largely because you have no control over ISO--the Coolpix would increase the ISO under most indoor conditions and the resulting pictures were noisy beyond belief. I returned the Coolpix for a refund and ordered another A570IS from Amazon. My advice to anyone that reads this review is to make sure that you have some control over the camera's ISO setting because on these small-sensor shooters, noise can be a real problem over ISO 200. Typically, the Auto mode on small cameras will increase ISO to 400 and beyond so I recommend owners use the P or Program mode to shoot most of their pictures so they can keep the ISO at 80, 100, or 200.  Canon's DIGIC III processor does a pretty good job of managing the trade offs between increasing ISO and noise reduction.What's great about the A570IS:  Control: amost prosumer level of control:  Flash exposure compensation  Choice of metering  Fully manual capability  Battery life with properly charged NiMH batteries  Image stabilization really works--I did a series of test photos  Decent user interface  Histogram (use it!)  Viewfinder (has one)  Shot-to-shot delays decently low if not using flash  On time less than 1 second  Autofocus reasonably fast (has focus assist in dim light)What's not so great about A570IS:  Battery life if batteries not properly charged  Display looks a bit on the low-rez side  4X zoom could be a bit wider angle for my tastes  Noisy above ISO 200 but this is largely true for all small digicams  Weak batteries can increase shot-to-shot delay waiting for flash to recharge", "Date": "January 28, 2008"}, {"Title": "Excellent Camera, Great Value", "Author": "Dailo", "ReviewID": "RHRN4B0X1HJA6", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I purchased this camera for my sister. I considered the A560 as well but for only $22 more, the A570 adds Image Stabilization; the decision was a no-brainer. At $150, you get an excellent camera that produces great colors. Shutter lag is minimal and barely noticeably different than my D40. This camera is targeted to the family user who wants to shoot in green mode most of the time. Those users will also appreciate the video mode that creates video files as large as your memory card will allow. It is not limited to 2 or 3 min. video clips.ISO above 400 starts to produce noticeable noise as most cameras in this class do. I would have appreciated a higher resolution LCD but considering that this is primarily a \"green mode\" camera, precise adjustments after previewing your shots is an uncommon occurrence.Overall, this is an excellent camera.

This camera is a big improvement over what we could find for the money last year. Young boys have a hard time holding still long enough to take pictures and the image stabilization allows him to take great shots anyway. This is one of the few cameras that has imagine stablization in this price range, and it also has video with sound. Image stabilization is a must if you use zoom or you will have blurry pictures. My son loves taking his own videos and transferring them to his Sansa player. A lot of the competitors cameras are lacking one or both of those features. Pay close attention when shopping to whether or not there is sound with the video if you want to be able to video with the camera. I looked at reviews on cameras all the way into the $250 range and could not find one that was a better buy  for the money than the 570 IS. For an adult however wanting to take pictures of children in plays and such, I would suggest the Cannon S3. It has a more powerful zoom, a flip out screen that swivels, and a true view finder.Don't forget to buy a good High Speed memory card for faster transfers from camera to card.

I have to agree with earlier reviewers on some sites that the instruction manual needs to be made available in a larger size.  As it is, many of the features require you to interpret the icons on the menu and the rotating selector on top of the camera.  These icons are far, far to small.  Additionally selections are often not as intuitive as might be desirable.  For example, it's important for me to be able to include the day/date on each of my shots.  Camera in my left hand and manual in the right did little to make this a simple set up.  First you had to figure out how to put the camera into the Postcard mode.  Then there was another step to make.  Once I had done this, I'm still left not knowing that if I stray away from the Postcard mode and then come back to it... that the day/date will return also.Great camera for the price.

I was looking for a compact camera to take the place of my EOS 30D when I didn't want to carry the larger camera.  I wanted something small enough to fit in my pocket - this camera is a bit large for that, but it does fit comfortably in my jacket pocket.This camera shoots nice photos in the portrait and scenic modes.  Color and sharpness is good, though it doesn't 'stand out' amoung other compact cameras I've seen.  The LCD screen is a good size and makes for easy viewing of the photos.  Controls are easy to use and laid out well.As some others have noted, this is not a 'low light' camera.  It's performance in low light situations is only average.  In regular lighting situations, the camera performs well.  The macro focus function is easy to access during shooting and the camera does a nice job on closeups.  Access to the flash override is nice too when I don't want to use the flash, it's easy to shut off.I have not yet used the IS feature, but looking more closely at some of my shots, it might have been a good idea.  Some shots looked good on the LCD, but proved to be out of focus or shaky when viewed on a computer screen - I don't know if it was camera shake or focus problems, but the focus indicator did show the camera was in focus at the time the photo was taken.My biggest complaints are these:  battery life isn't all that great - even with nice high current rechargeables, this camera can't come close to my older Olympus C5050, which ran more than 3 times as long on 4 'AA' rechargeables.  The other issue is the lag time between shots - first of all, even when the focus is locked, there is a lag sometime from the time you press the shutter to the time it fires - not good when shooting a moving child.  Also, the downtime between shots is a bit longer than I would expect for a camera like this - even with brand new batteries.  I would like to see Canon find a way to improve this.I have used the video function, and for a little compact camera, it does a very nice job - 30fps.  The microphone is nothing special and you won't get great audio, but if you want that, carry a camcorder.  For a pocket camera and on the fly video it does nicely.Overall a good camera, but I'll be looking to Canon to improve a bit in some areas the next time I buy a compact.I would recommend this camera as one of the better compacts I've seen and used.", "Date": "February 15, 2008"}, {"Title": "This camera is awesome.

The features are immense for my novice photography perspective although, after reading the manual, I determined that it wouldn't be long before I figured it all out.  The presets are easy to access and the capacity of this camera to further conform to my needs is well beyond my current necessity.  The camera accepts a large range of add-ons, particularly in the lens/filter category, which I didn't read about regarding any of the other cameras I studied before my purchase.  The stabilization and face-finding features are quite impressive and I produced some great photos on my first day with the camera.  The resolution options get very large and, thus, use alot of memory but once I figured out all of the manual adjustments in the menu, I was well on my way to taking some of the best photos I have ever seen with such a small camera.

I read several online reviews, both professionally done and from amateur photographers. First off, this camera is highly rated by several places. Obviously there is something to be said for that. However, in my hands this camera was a complete disapointment. I don't know if I just got a bad one or what, but I tried several settings, under several conditions, even had other people take photos, yet this camera produced a blurry image everytime. I never could achieve a very crisp image. I read the entire manual, used all the tweaks and everything. Most of the time the face recognition focus feature of the DIGIC III never even identified the faces in the shot. Typically it would focus on anything BUT the subject! Some people told me that Canon cameras tend to give a softened more \"studio portrait\" image. I don't know about that, but my old digital camera (although it is lower megapixel) produced a crisper image. This might be a good thing if that is what you are looking for.This camera really left me baffled. It's pack with numerous features, too many almost. I mean do you really need that many functions in a point and shoot? I expected it to snap great photos right out of the box, but instead it took some tweaking to get decent photos. Either this camer is highly overrated, or I got a complete dud. In either case it either says something about people who are biased toward reviewing canon cameras ( I mean what manufacturers has 80%+ of their products get positive reviews?) or it says something about how fragile the mechanics in this camera are. I really wanted this to be the great camera everyone says it is, but it just wasn't for me.BEST ADVICE: Buy from a retailer with a good return policy. Theres no single digital camera meant for everyone despite what anyone else says regarding it's performance, usefulness and fit to your needs.

Relatively inexpensive (I got it for 140 bucks, shipped).2. Full manual control and manual focus.3. Pretty small.4. Not too many mega pixels. I don't want a camera with 10MP on a 1 cm sensor (the actual usable sensor size is much smaller than that anyway).5. It works with CHDK, a 'hacked firmware' developed by the community, which allows all kind of neat stuff, such as motion detection, live histogram, RAW, and so on.The quality of the image is pretty good for such a cheap and small camera. There is noise even at ISO 80 in full light. However, the camera will apply some noise reduction which takes care of the noise but removes some detail. By default, the camera will also sharpen the noise (well, actually the whole image), which looks bad. However, you can use the above mentioned CHDK firmware, and save the images as raw. Personally, I wouldn't go over ISO 80 with this camera, but I guess ISO 200 is OK too, to some extent.The battery life is great, you can take 200+ pictures with a set of NiMh batteries, so long as you do not use the flash.One thing I am not very happy about is the macro mode. If you take a picture of a normal size fly, the fly will be ~600 pixels long.The zoom range (35-140mm) is also not ideal, but it's a compact camera, so some compromises have to be made.Overall, I highly recommend it, it's probably the cheapest camera on the market that takes good quality pictures and has full manual controls.", "Date": "June 29, 2008"}, {"Title": "Get this Camera", "Author": "Michael A.

I consider myself an advanced amateur photographer, having used Canon's EOS system for years and owning a Nikon digital camera in addition to the Canon A570is. Here are my thoughts so far:1. The camera itself works very well. The controls are intuitive and there are lots and lots of creative choices, though I suspect the creative mode has more options than most people will use. The program mode is very nice, it's great to be able to set ISO as well as aperture and speed, and the manual focus is helpful. I took photos of my son's musical performance from the back of a large, dark auditorium with the ISO set at 800 and 1600, no flash, digital zoom, program mode, and the photos were fairly usable. Sure there was visible noise, but who can expect perfection with digital zoom at those high \"film speeds?\"2. Yes, the battery warning goes on. I don't like it, and that's probably why Canon is selling this camera for this price. However, for $130 I can ignore it. Actually, I just mute all the needless sounds and use the power saving functions to reduce battery use. I use rechargeable Energizers, so batteries aren't costing me a fortune, and they last for 150 pictures or so. That's fine. Just carry a set of spares in your pocket.3. The size and weight of the camera are very nice...it's not much bigger than my little Nikon Coolpix 5600, which still works great after four hard years, by the way.4. Now the software. Canon's website doesn't work right, so I had to go to [...] to download updates. Get the update to Zoombrowser. It's a useful one. Now here's the thing: When I first explored Zoombroser I loved it, since I'm a user of the simple stuff on Adobe Photoshop Elements. I was hoping Zoombrowser would do all the stuff I needed ...until I got to the \"Trim\" function, which is the \"crop\" function. If you want to crop to a certain size, you have to be in \"advanced.\" But the software is difficult for cropping to a certain size, like 5x7 or 8x10. If you like math you can see that the preset 3:2 and 2:3 ratios are for a 6x4 or 4x6 photo. But there's no exact preset ratio for 5x7s or 8x10s.Then, after a half hour of math to crop to the size you want, you go to print. Guess what! You can only print a full page print, not one with borders, not an 8x10, not a 5x7, not a 4x6...only a whopping, ink draining full page print. Come on Canon...you can do better than that. The rest of the editing functions are terrific, but the trim and print shortcomings make ZoomBrowser EX less useful. I like its organizing ability a lot, except...it only organized .jpegs (perhaps RAW and TIFF but I don't have a camera that produces those). Sooo, if I have Photoshopped photos saved as .pdf - which I do because I have been using photoshop - they don't show up in ZoomBrowser. Darn.5. The email function in ZoomBrowser EX is great. You can easily set the size of attachments and tell the size of your total attachment. I'll use that function a lot.6. In order to print photos the size I want on 8 x 11.5 paper, I have to save the photo, then open it again in the software that came with my little Nikon because it allows me to put precise borders on the prints. It would be great if the Canon software did that.7. In conclusion: It's a good little camera for the price. If you only use the very common but lossy .jpeg format that this camera uses (as do  all digital cameras as a minimum), then you're fine with the included  Zoombrowser software, unless you want precise cropping and printing. For me, I'll use the included Canon ZoomBrowser for most touching up except printing, and use Zoombrowser to see what camera settings I used and to organize my photos. The email sending function in Zoombrower works very well also.Postscript: After about three months, I still like the camera OK. I'd reduce my evaluation to three stars, however. I've noticed a few more shortcomings. The low resolution of the screen make it hard to tell if the scene is in focus, or to evaluate the quality of the photo you have taken. This makes the potentially very helpful manual focus mode not very helpful at all, since you can't tell if you are in focus due to the low resolution mentioned above. It's a great idea, but Canon blew it.If the Canon engineers read this stuff, I hope they will think about putt ing Nikon's Best Shot Selector mode in their cameras. It's a great tool that takes up to 10 continuous exposures of the subject, and then the software selects the most in-focus exposure. It is great when photographing flowers moving in the wind (which they nearly always do) or when it's hard to tell if the subject is in focus (like when the screen has low resolution). I can do a similar thing with the Canon by using the Continuous Shooting mode while in Micro, but you have to select the best photo yourself later. It's better than nothing.PackJac", "Date": "March 19, 2008"}, {"Title": "A fine camera", "Author": "J.

This is our second Canon (I have been using an S3 IS for little over a year now). We were looking for a small point-n-shoot and considered many options between Sony, Nikon, Canon, Panasonic and Olympus based upon user reviews, product features etc. I don't need to tell you how this camera outdid all others (other people have done a great job already, besides camera's ranking on Amazon speaks for itself). Best features and cheap price sealed the deal for us.We have been enjoying our S3 IS, as I said, for more than a year. We travelled a lot last year and have lots of sweet memories preserved in some awesome snaps (many of them breathtakingly beautiful). This year we wanted to go for something smaller for Indoor ocassions (parties, marriages, birthdays etc.) and spent close to 3 months visiting stores and online shopping sites. I am in technical trade and like to evaluate everything the same way before I buy it. For my wife, compactness and ease-of-use are top priority. From a technical standpoint, we are poles apart. She likes things to be simple, while for me a product needs to pack lot of features. So you can imagine how hard it is for us to decide on buying something. However, with Canon Powershot 570IS, it was a different story altogether. We both found what we were looking for. It packs lot of good features (manual controls for shutter/speed/exposure etc., viewfinder for ease of shooting in broad daylight, red-eye reduction, Face-priority AF, Program and Manual modes for complete shooting flexibility, decent battery consumption,  in-camera editing tools etc. etc. etc. ... and my favorite, Image Stabalization), yet it is easy to use and carry around.I read all the -ve reviews on Amazon about A570 IS, but, am sorry to say, I do not agree with even one of them. These seem to come from people who have very high expectations from a very low price (even at that this camera is a decent performer, believe me).We were fortunate to find a store where we could actually test and compare the quality of pictures taken from all the models that we had on our consideration list. In our budget and expectations, the other strong contenders included Sony Cybershot DSC W80 and Panasonic DMC-FX10. This camera beat them on 95% of the fronts.I hope others get to enjoy this camera as we have.

I also had battery problems to begin with.

I haven't dropped mine yet, but I doubt this camera would survive it very well.All in all, not bad for everyday pictures. There are features that allow one to tweak things, but the instructions do go into detail about them. If one can figure out all of the extras, I'm sure this is probably an awesome camera.Update; I recently purchased an introductory DVD for this camera that's really put its complete functionality in my hands. I would give the camera a 5 star rating, now that I've learned all about it.Updated, again; I loved this camera, but it died in less than 2 years. After putting in fully charged batteries, a short occurred (due to a design flaw in the battery door that Canon backed away from acknowledging some time ago,) which overheated the camera & cracked the mirror inside, causing a blurry line to cross all of my photos.

Owned it for 2 years and dropped it many times - so its robust!  Used it for some yummy macro work - always handy due to small size.  I used to lug a big 35mm film camera (still do at times) - and while this does not compare in image quality (sort of like comparing apples and oranges), it has something very distinctive and attractive all the same.  Colors are warm, tonal range is not bad, and highlights don't blow out so much the way many of these little point and shoot cameras seem to (losing detail in the bright spots).  I can shoot dozens of pix and select the best (get the biggest memory card you can find, or carry a spare).  It is wonderful for natural light -  flowers, and even people, but, as with digital Point and shoots in general, the shutter lag will cause you to \"lose the moment\" quite a lot - so you have to be prepared to shoot a lot of pix -  esp if you prefer candid.  Because you are not holding a giant gleaming lens in peoples faces, through which you must peer like a scientist, but instead glancing casually down at a small screen while you click away silently (yes you can turn off that fake shutter noise) - candid shots can be really great.But its digital, so sort of like a painting - rich colors, but don't expect the razor sharpness of a high end lens.  That said the macro is very pleasing on this, and the detail remarkable, and the ease of use invites picture taking, so  - you will end up well pleased I expect.  The one down side to Canon in general is the manner in which they pack 20 pounds of features into a 10 pound package - the controls are small and fiddly - and will take some time and practice to figure out how to find your manual set options.  Read the manual if you want to miss nothing - I rarely did and wished I had as some features did not become apparent until after months of use.Only thing I might wish for would be a rechargeable battery, a less slippery housing to prevent dropping, an internal system so it knows the date and time without being reset with every battery change, and a grippier design - almost too small.  A  faster lens/more glass - lets in more light - but this is minor, the lens is pretty great actually.

It really isn't too much of a problem anymore. But it takes the flash forever to charge up with only 2 AA cells running the show.- Flash exposures, particularly at macro settings, are better than older Powershots. Canon really got this right - in \"party mode\", and in macro (which I use a lot) the camera will get it right every time.- A bit more aggressive about increasing the \"film speed\" in auto mode. My old A70 always tried to expose everything at \"ASA\" 50, even in low light, and I was always manually setting it to \"ASA\" 200 or 400 and forgetting to set it back. You can leave the A570 on \"Auto\" more of the time, and not worry about accidentally getting a whole day's worth of grainy, washed-out pictures at \"ASA\" 200. There is an \"AHA HI\" setting.- The image stabilization seems to work just fine.Minuses:- Power management is a complete disaster. I will never buy a Canon Powershot again. You will not be able to shoot with it without several sets of spare batteries. I can get only about 30 to 50 exposures off a pair of 2300 MaH NiMh's, and only 10 or 20 off a pair of Alkalines. The low battery indicator comes on almost immediately after the first few exposures. Canon made a big mistake going from 4-AA to 2-AA power for its cameras. I only ended up with the A570is because Canon offered to trade in my defective A-70 for it at a low price.- Optics are a bit better than older Powershots, but that's not saying much. Some distortion and aberration at full aperture, and telephoto zooms look like crap. Stopped down at wide aperture, it's fine.- Still the same puny sub-pencil-eraser sized 1/2.5 sensor as earlier Powershots. \"High ASA\" exposures are still noisy.", "Date": "December 11, 2008"}, {"Title": "Nice camera with lots of features for the price - But 1 Big Problem", "Author": "mooltar \"mooltar\"", "ReviewID": "R2YPUWYYMZ8LRL", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "I purchased this camera back in April of this year with the intent of using it for things like taking pictures for eBay listings and some casual family pictures.The camera is full of features and I was able to finally figure several of the features after hours of research.

I suppose that was a promotional discount.I have enjoyed every moment of owning this camera.  The memory card provided with the camera holds only a couple of shots; the first chance you get, replace it with a larger-capacity card with a minimum of 1 gigabyte.You can easily turn the autofill flash off.  Hardly any flash is needed for outside photos anyway.  This makes the cycle time (time lag between one shot and the next) shorter, and the battery last longer.  Use the best batteries you can find; the lithium batteries (about $[...] a pair) are the best.  A 1GB card can hold hundreds of photos.Uploading the photos into your computer requires a card-reader (about $[...]), if your computer doesn't have a built-in card reader.  They do not need to be installed if your system is XP or more recent (and something similar for Macs, no doubt).  The photos live in a folder on the card called DCIM, or something like that.  You simply select the ones you want, and drag them across to your computer.  The included software will enable you to (1) resize the pictures, (2) crop them, (3) rotate them, and (4) print them.  With better software, all sorts of magic is possible.The camera EVEN TAKES VIDEOS.  I have taken tons of videos, and even the sound is good.  Here are some examples; the sound quality is simply because I'm using the tiny microphone on the camera, and not the microphones they're using; THOSE were to make a huge noise, which is apparently important for rock groups: [...]It comes across as a AVI file, which can be made into a DVD with the software microsoft bundles in with their operating systems.  I'm sure this capability is common in cameras, but I never expected to be able to make videos of this quality with just a still camera.  NOTE: you must set the resolution to high quality on the camera beforehand.  I can't remember how this is done; until I did this, I could only take low-quality videos, which invariably shut off after three minutes, and were of a small size.  (Actually, I think I remember setting it that way without thinking when I took my first video.  So it's quite possible that the default setting is to make high-quality videos.)  The total length of time a clip can be depends on the size of your memory card; I remember reading somewhere how many megabytes a minute used up, but I forget.  I think it was right in the user's guide.Another Note: The user's guide has references to basic information and advanced information.  These references are to the TWO GUIDES that come with the camera.  The books are referring to each other.

I haven't had a blurry image yet. The picture quality is far superior to the camera that was replaced and I especially like the ability to crop a photo and then have it appear full size without a grainy appearance. Importing to iPhoto is very fast and simple. This camera's video capability really surprised me with its ease and picture quality.

If this is such a problem with this camera, Canon should recommend and offer a hard case. Secondly, Canon should have a \"first offense\" repair so that your initial cost is reasonable and you can prepare yourself for future use, such as get a hard case which they should have but don't (I did get one on EBay).

Good camera, takes good pictures.  The only reason I don't give it five stars is that out of the box the clock battery was almost dead and it wouldn't keep the time in memory.

Why I like the Canon A- line and have bought about 6 of them in the last three years (A510, A530, A710) - 1)  AA batteries are available everywhere.  I use rechargables.  2)  SD cards are inexpensive.  If you get a camera with Memory Stick or XD, you will pay a lot more for memory.  I picked up 2 GB cards for $15 each.  3)  Good optical zoom of 4X.  Digital zooms are essentially useless.  4)  Good control layout and menus.  Good grip on the camera for single hand use and they still have viewfinders which are good in very bright light.  I would say I use the back display for about 80% of shots, but the viewfinder comes in handy.The included 16 MB memory card is way too small to be practical, so budget for at least a 2 GB SD card.

I chose this model instead of the newer model available based on price and features.  True, the newer model has 8.2 instead of 7.1 Megapixels, but honestly I don't think this makes much difference in picture quality.  The other new feature causes the camera to \"wait\" until the subject smiles.  To me this is more of a gimmick than anything else.  After using the camera for a few weeks I found that the one drawback is the battery usage.  The (2) AA batteries that came with the camera lasted two hours at best.  Using Duracell Alkaline batteries I found that the batteries run down very quickly.  I used up one set of batteries after taking a dozen shots in-doors with the flash.  I'm thinking of investing in a battery charger.  The camera is a little larger than the new \"slim-line\" styled cameras that are very popular.  To me this is not a disadvantage, since I use the one side of the camera as a handle and it keeps my fingers away from the shutter.  In bright sunlight, the display is difficult to see, but I was able to compose the shot through the viewfinder.  The image stabilizer is the best feature on the camera, allowing the user to take distance shots without a tripod.

The lens and other components combine to produce sharp, good quality pictures for any sensible use.  6. With common sense use of the pre-focus feature, shutter lag is negligible.

I strongly prefer a AA NiMH standardized power approach to a proprietary L-ion because I already have plenty of batteries and chargers to support the standard approach. The first set of batteries, it didn't like, but after recharging them with 2 different chargers, it got well over 100 pic's from the same set...go figure.The Image Stabilization works well...far fewer 'blurries' with this camera than previous ones.I like the movie mode so much I bought a 4gb, class 6 kingston high-speed SD/SDHC chip to use it as a camcorder substitute. George Lucas isn't worried, but it meets my minimal requirements at this time.It's a bit big for a pocket camera, but wear cargo pants/shorts and it works great. BTW, tape the transparent LCD protector on to protect the LCD when it's in your pocket.I'm no pro, but all those that write reviews rave about the picture quality and I have no reason to disagree.I also don't disagree with those that grouse a bit about slow recover time in flash mode...in this area it's a musket, not a semi-automatic, so make that shot count.This is my 3rd digicam and all in all it's a great value for handy, yet high quality photography.", "Date": "April 21, 2008"}, {"Title": "Excellent Buy!!!", "Author": "C.

The feature-set is great, including pluses such as face-detection and an abundant number of shooting modes.  An additional feature which I have never seen advertised is the camera's motion sensor, which rotates the image on playback.  If I take a vertical  photo, for example, I can hold the camera horizontally and see it smaller, or hold it vertically and see the picture full-screen.  This is almost more of a convenience than a feature, but it is touches like these that cause me to enjoy a camera.This camera is superb.  My only gripe, however, is with the camera's size.  For all I know, this is as small as a camera with 4x zoom can be, but I probably would have preferred a slightly more compact camera.  Additionally, the A570IS eats up batteries, but I cannot fault it for that, since it uses only 2 AA batteries, and using only 2 keeps the camera lightweight.

I also have owned Canon film cameras. This is the first time I have had a problem with a Canon camera.I noticed that the battery life was very short from the day I received the A570IS camera - early December, 2007. This problem only got worse to the point that whether the rechargeable batteries were NEW or not so new (but good batteries I have been using in my Canon S2IS) the red battery light would come on after a relatively small number of pictures had been taken (the LED screen would not be usable, but I could snap a picture using the viewer). If I left charged batteries in the camera and turned it off, by the next morning the low battery indicator would come on. I called Canon support and the techie suggested I clean the battery contacts - first with a pencil eraser and, if that didn't help, by using a small amount of alcohol on a q-tip. I ended up trying both of these techniques and they helped some, but I still have the same problem with the battery light coming on after taking a relatively few shots. When I took the \"low batteries\" out of the A570IS and tested them, they would show that they were almost fully charged.  Next I took 4 of these batteries that would not work in my Powershot A570IS because of \"low battery\" and put them in my Canon S2IS. The S2IS camera worked fine with these same batteries and did not show \"low battery\". Therefore, I knew it was not the batteries and that the problem was with the camera. I was all set to send it to Canon for repair, but the techie suggested I return it to the vendor. So, on Monday 1/21 I contacted Amazon to exchange the camera and by Thursday 1/24 I had the replacement camera. I have not had time to check out the battery life, but am hopeful based on my past experience with Canon. I found it surprisingly easy to work with both Canon and Amazon support to resolve my issues (fingers crossed).", "Date": "January 25, 2008"}, {"Title": "My first digital camera!", "Author": "Amazon Customer", "ReviewID": "R2SQ8PSZL9XSK9", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I'm not a photographer.

(On an environmental note, its nice that it comes packaged with a cardboard insert inside the box as opposed to styrafoam.) I like the fact that it runs on AA batteries.

In an attempt to move my jacket out of the way in boarding a kayak in fresh water (Rainbow River, Fl), one of the pockets of the gore-tex jacket accidentally hung out of the craft (unbeknowngs to me) when my partner sitting behind me said \"one of your pockets is in the water\". Yep, it had the Canon camera in it; it had been submerged inside the pocket for about a full minute (perhaps longer), but the pocket hadn't pooled with water, only was wet inside. Needless to say, it appeared to be a goner. The viewfinder had beads of water inside, and the screen inside showed condensation and water droplets. Also, the battery compartment had some water in it, but not pooled, but enough that I could pour out several drops from it. I removed the batteries, and over a period of about 60 hours, exposed the camera to sunlight on the dashboard and inside the glove compartment to dry out. It gradually dissapated the droplets inside the viewfinder, and the condensation from the inside screen disappeared. Only at that time did I attempt to turn it on. I couldn't believe it! The 4GB SD card was intact with the pics, and the motor successfully retracted the lens. A few trial pics confirmed that the camera is now back in working order.

One caveat that the instructions don't warn you about is the camera could turn on in camera mode while in your pocket or purse and the lens telescopes out to where it could be damaged. This happened to me because I had been carrying it with me wherever I went, it was so handy. But in my case, the lens must have come out in my pocket and somehow gotten jammed. It would no longer retract or turn on and an error message saying \"restart camera\" would appear. Since I could not get it to work and I had the camera for just over a month, I assumed that the warranty would cover it. I was wrong!!! The factory service said that I must have dropped it or somehow damaged the telescoping mechanism and that was not covered under the warranty, and they wanted to charge me $89 plus $8 for shipping. When I complained that I had not dropped or otherwise abused the camera, they reduced the charge by 50% to $44.50, plus $8 for shipping. That left me out $52.50 plus the $7.50 to send it in making a total out of pocket $60. This for a camera only a little over a month old and costing less than three times the amount to repair it. So be warned, if you decide to purchase this camera or any other similar Canon product, put the camera into the \"Review\" mode, not the \"Camera\" mode when not in use to prevent the telescoping mechanism from activating and damaging it.This flaw is not covered in the instructions. Canon should cover any damage due to the mechanism turning on where the camera is not dropped or otherwise abused, under their warranty, and they should authorize shipment to their repair facility prepaid by Canon, so that the customer is not out of pocket. I only had the camera a little over a month, and I liked it so well I bought one as a gift, this was before I found that the instructions were flawed and the warranty bogus. So be aware before you decide to buy. Based on my experience with Canon and their warranty, I would not buy another Canon product unless they modify their instructions and warranty coverage.", "Date": "November 28, 2007"}, {"Title": "Canon Powershot A570IS", "Author": "Befad", "ReviewID": "R14QFZYDWDIRQW", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This is my third Canon camera and I am very pleased with it.

I actually had decided to go with A570 - I boxed the others up to return and was happy.  However, by then, the 2 alkaline batteries that come with the camera had finally died and I replaced with the rechargable hi-quality batteries that were in my old, trusty Canon A85. The A570 rejected them and continually said \"change battery!\" So..I tried some other rechargables I had on hand - rejected those too!  I even tried some plain alkaline batteries - it did accept those, but they were brand new. I don't understand it - my old A85 would take any batteries shoved in it, and my mom's A530 takes anything too with no issues at all.  However, if after 3 tries, this camera only accepted brand new regular batteries, it just wasn't realistic to keep it. On the beach, heck - sand probably gets in the chamber of my A85 and it kept on truckin.  I've read a few other people complain about this on A570, but not many, so maybe I got a lemon or maybe it was just me.  In any case, I love the slightly bigger feel of this camera - it's actually easier for my husband to grip than the little compact cameras.  I also found this camera to have a great standard layout of the play/camera switch, on/off button etc.  And, it takes exceptional pictures for the price - really.  It's bigger than the SD series which can be a good thing for my husband's big hands.  But, the battery issue and the poor resolution screen just killed it for me.  I couldn't see the screen from any angle except dead on center - viewing from the sides was total washout - the SD series screens were not that way at all.  This screen washed out badly in bright sunlight outdoors and since I don't use viewfinder much, it just wouldn't work.  Also, I found there to be a noticable lag time between flash shots that the SD series doesn't appear to experience.", "Date": "November 30, 2007"}, {"Title": "Batteries Batteries and more Batteries", "Author": "S.

I used to have a Fujifilm, which I really like but was lost. I could take pics any time of day with the flash and never had to doctor it up with the software.It's been 3 months since I bought it and now the focus is doing weird things and I can't get it to focus on anything. Not sure why. Of couse, Cannon Customer Service won't do anything about since it was dropped 2 days after I got it and the battery compartment has a gap - still works but it's obvious that it was dropped.  I noticed this same gap on friends Powershots.  I don't know if it's a common issue or not.So now, 3 months after I got it, I'm out $239 and my ebay picture taking is ground to a halt and I need to find something else soon.

I have always heard good things about Canon but I for one, after owning this camera, am not impressed and am going back to Olympus.Pros:(1) It's small.(2) It's perfect for family type pictures (ie..birthday parties, soccer games, family gatherings)(3) I like the fact that it's basically \"point and shoot\" without having to worry about manually adjusting it every time.Cons:(1) red eye. I have never had a red-eye with my Olympus but this little Canon seems to have red-eye in every picture regardless of setting or lighting. I don't like having to go back later and fix all the red-eye errors it produces.(2) It's zoom lacks severely. We often go out for rides in the mountains and this camera is horrible for wildlife pictures at a distance. My Olympus maintains photograph quality and integrity even when you crop it. This Canon does NOT. It has a limited zoom and the quality becomes very grainy the more you zoom in. I am very unhappy with that feature.(3) Picture Quality. I have my Canon set on the highest quality. Granted I consider myself a novice but there is a noticeable difference in my Canon when compared with my Olympus. The pictures are not as sharp or clear with the Canon. Several of my friends and family have also noticed the difference. I am extremely disappointed in picture quality.(4) battery life: This camera sucks up batteries like crazy. For me it almost isn't worth owning it for the amount of money I have spent in batteries for it!Overall:It's a decent camera but it isn't for me. I expect more out of a camera and this one fell way short of the mark. Again, this camera is a great little \"family\" camera..fun for vacations, parties etc..but if you want to take really good quality pictures I would suggest either moving up the Canon line and spending more money and getting a better camera or move to a different brand.

FLIMSY HINGES,UNEXPLAINED (IN THE USER MANUAL) SIDEWAYS PLAY. The little slider to toggle between shoot /diplay feels decidedly \"loose\"....or a problem waiting to happen? Fiddling with various dim light settings I DID manage some fun shots in low light. More fiddling produced some interesting Macros....but much trial and error...the infra red beam seemed to \"miss\" 2/3 of the time. *NOW FOR THE EXCITING PART.I BOUGHT THIS BECAUSE MY OLD A310 suddenly went \"BLIND\". Camera shop told me to throw it away. \"You are lucky to have gotten 3 yrs. out of it...most last 2 yrs.\") etc. etc. GUESS WHAT?!...Although Canon refuses to call it a RECALL the A310 (along with 36 other models of CANON camera and camcorder)are under \"SERVICE ADVISORIES\". Means what? That even though out of warranty Canon will fix it free because of an identified defect with lens function. (Also those who have previously paid for repair of same problem may be eligible for reimbursement of costs) Calling them is the best method, because their web site is very coy and obscure until they tell you how to navigate to your needed \"service advisory\".SO I was going to return the A570 when and if the A310 is fixed, BUT...I am falling in like with it!EXCEPT FOR THAT PESKY LO-BATTERY INDICATOR....which is clearly faulty. But how many replacements would I have to test if the fault is in a batch of sensors CANON installed in all of them?Oh yeah.... CANON claims:  \"we do not make \"throw-away\" cameras, these are designed  for many many years of service....  of course, camera dealers are there to make $$\"As for their software for camera to PC transfer, I just tried something else first, as an experiment.I used the USB cable from my old A310 (taking no chances there) and followed same old method.

Thus, I was missing out on all of the memories. I wanted a camera that was easy to use and reliable but still had all of the bells and whistles if I decided to learn more. The Canon A570IS fits this bill admirably. The auto setting allows one to take splendid photos without worrying about red eye and image stabilization.  A big bonus is that the camera uses two AA batteries including rechargeables and SD cards which are easy to find. The camera comes with two manuals, basic and advanced. The basic manual is OK for getting started. However, the advanced manual is poorly written, especially for a novice like me. I definitely recommend this camera if you want something that is easy to use and takes excellent photos. It also has enough features for an intermediate user who wants to learn more about camera operation. If you purchase the camera go through a legit site like Amazon. I used Amazon as it had the best price with free shipping and no tax if you are willing to wait for 8-9 days. Places like Tiger and New Egg are also good places to order from. Avoid the New York retailers as they are rip offs.
