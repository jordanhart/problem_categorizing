Chang", "ReviewID": "R3OFWT2GR781UR", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "I was choosing a simple to use digital camera for my father. Kodak C633 came to my attention during the after Thanksgiving sale. It appears to be a slim down version of Kodak C643. They have almost identical characteristics. The only noticeable difference seems to be the internal memory size, 16 MB (C633) vs. 32 MB (C643).It is a properly constructed little camera. The 2.4-inch LCD display should be relatively comfortable to view for senior people. The mode dial is clearly marked with just a few selected modes that are useful to most situations. The overall design is clean and uncluttered.I took some pictures both indoor and outdoor. While the camera is really easy to shoot, some improvements are desirable. First thing I noticed after taking my first pictures with the camera is that solid colors in the images show a lot of noises. Its noise reduction is just not good enough even for a blue sky on a sunny day.When taking indoor pictures, you will need to watch the lighting condition. Its auto focus has trouble to focus on object in the low light situation. (It has no auto focus assistance light.) Some times it failed to focus when the object lacks enough contrast. There are cameras in the same price range fare better in those situations.If you can get a good bargain and can tolerate noises in the images, then you may find this camera a joy to use. But for me, I had to return it for something better.", "Date": "December 1, 2006"}, {"Title": "This thing eats batteries like crazy", "Author": "Patrick", "ReviewID": "R2YFYIKCWKTPS1", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "I've gone through so many packages of batteries using this thing. And I don't use it that much. This thing just dies in no time flat.The picture quality ranges from great to terrible. It depends on the lighting in the room. Bad lighting and the picture comes out all grainy and not worth keeping.Video quality is also soso.I guess it's a good camera if you're looking for something affordable that does average quality work.", "Date": "August 28, 2007"}, {"Title": "Good Idea, Bad Execution", "Author": "R.

I have never used it much but in the last year it intermittently refuses to turn on. It doesn't matter if I have fresh batteries in it or not. Sometimes it works and sometimes it doesn't. If I take the batteries out and put them back in that will sometimes get it to work. Regardless, Kodak knows about the problem as I am not alone with this issue but they are doing nothing about it. Frankly, I think Kodak has terrible low end and mid range products (I also have a Kodak AIO that I spent a fortune on that is hardly used and needs new printheads) and their customer service reps are in denial. I'm not sure why they call it \"support.\" Once upon a time when I was young Kodak had one of the best reps around but not anymore. I will never buy their products again. I suggest that you get a better camera from Sony or Cannon. They're better quality for your money.", "Date": "May 3, 2011"}, {"Title": "Kodak Easy Share C633 6.1 MP Digital Camera", "Author": "S.

I got it for a Christmas gift with the docking station only 2 years ago, and it's shot.  The first thing that I noticed with the camera is the shutter got stuck, 1/4 to 1/2 way open, not good.  Had to pry it open manually.  Next, the camera sucked batteries like there was no tomorrow, sort of like the big oil execs. sucked our money when gas was nearly $5.00 a gallon.  The 3rd, and final thing that happened to the camera is the screen went out.  How can you take pictures if you don't have any screen?  Junk, Junk, Junk, probably made in China with lead too....", "Date": "December 13, 2008"}, {"Title": "I hate this camera", "Author": "J. Trower", "ReviewID": "R2S1QJM7CFRGOY", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "This is the worst camera I ever used. I am so disappointed with it. The pictures are not that great. Never take a closeup with this camera, unless you like blurry pictures (even when you use the setting for close pictures) The lighting conditions have to be perfect to get a good picture off this camera - i.e. a bright sunny day.. otherwise expect to be disappointed.

Bee", "ReviewID": "R1RMRCAFT4T38I", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I LOVED my Easyshare C633!  The Auto focus was great and took better pics (on automatic focus mode) than friends' cameras which were more expensive.  The only huge problem I had with it was that the LCD screen is so fragile.  I returned my first (due to broken LCD screen) and had to trash the 2nd (for the same reason).  Other than that, I'd say it's a great beginner camera, very user-friendly and easy to operate.It sucks up batteries, though seems to work best with AA Energizer lithium.  Rechargeable Duracell batteries are always good to have, since you'll rotate through them a lot.By the way...I hope you never have to contact Kodak for help with any product, because the support people at Kodak are not very helpful and you have to jump through hoops to speak to an actual person on the phone.", "Date": "June 11, 2007"}, {"Title": "Great Lil Camera", "Author": "Carolyn R. Sturgill \"crsturgill\"", "ReviewID": "R25K8QF8ABL7CB", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I bought this a few weeks ago to upgrade from a 1.3/2 mp camera.  It was easy to use right out of the box.  The menu & dials are self explantory pretty much what you see on any point & shoot camera.  It's internal memory is only 16mb so you will need at least a 512mb or 1gb card to take alot of pictures.  But that's no problem since you can find them practically anywhere.  You can plug the camera in to your pc or take the card out and put in a reader.  Very easy.It takes great pictures, I have even taken a picture in the dark to see how it would turn out and it was if the room was lit up.  Great detail & no blur.  Now of course not all pictures are going to turn out & I'm not claiming they will, but in playing around with it I'm very satisfied with the picture quality.  Also, a nice 2.5 LCD screen + view finder.All digital cameras eat batteries, it's a known fact.  I have 1800 & 2500 NiMh batteries which will last longer than alkaline, however I also bought a crv3 lithium rechargeable with charger & have not had any problems with batteries since.  (Be careful installing this battery, the door does not want to close easily and could be broken if not careful, however battery fits & works fine once you get it in.) I'm giving it four stars due to the battery door, could have been made better to accomodate batteries without strain.Pictures are easily downloaded, software is easy to use.  But if you are looking to edit pictures extensivly then a better software would be recommended.Highly recommend this camera for beginners & novices alike.", "Date": "January 7, 2007"}, {"Title": "Good Camera!", "Author": "R.

At first few days using it it'll be really confusing and then you think you have it but it'll still be confusing and then your just mad at it for changing the looks of when taking picture (because of too much light) turning light to pink and dark or just turning dark and bad looks and confusing features. Well I was just about to buy a new camera when I thought that maybe just one last shot and trying to learn more about it, and i did and then it got really easy to use, well not that easy but alot easier and didnt think id have to go and buy a new one, it may have not been '100% easy and awsome' but it was still good and ok and that's all i needed (by the way when the sun changed it to pink, press menu then menu again or reveiw and review again or something to get out picture taking and back and it should go back to normal).", "Date": "July 2, 2007"}, {"Title": "Easyshare C633 OK???", "Author": "Jon A.

First of all, the software kept giving me errors and had to reboot/reload software 3 times before it would function. 2nd, The camera will not take clear pics unless it is perfectly still, which i've only found can occur when placed on a table (unbelievable!). 3rd, the batteries died after 25 pictures.

Mason \"krazykat\"", "ReviewID": "RWUNAJAJD41HY", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Got this for Christmas, LOVE IT!  While I may not be a camera expert, I love this little guy!  Super cute, super small, there are probably smaller out there, but this fits in my smallest purses easily and that's all I really need. Easy to figure out, I didn't even read the manual until later Christmas night.  I suppose if I thought of myself as a professional quality photographer, I would have something bigger, and more expensive with bells, whistles and a thing to go fetch the paper, but for a regular person just wanting to take snap shots of general things going on, I think this works well.The batteries did run out pretty quickly, but then again, I was taking pictures of everything, playing with all the buttons and features, and batteries included with electronics are notoriously short-lived.  I didn't bother with the software included; it doesn't have any really neat effects that I can't live without.  I also might buy a memory card to save more pictures of assorted junk that I think I might need a picture of.So, in conclusion, the camera is small, easy to figure out, and fun.  The downside would be the short-lived batteries, the boring software, and lack of storage space.  I'm just going to get some rechargeable batteries, a memory card, and maybe a photo-shop program.  Finally, if you're a professional photographer, you should know better and have better equipment, but for a starter/novice/average person, I think this camera's great.", "Date": "December 27, 2006"}, {"Title": "It is fine", "Author": "Patricia L.
