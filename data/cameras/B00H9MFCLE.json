Armstrong \"BA\"", "ReviewID": "R197J7UGRKN6QG", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Camera and lenses are great and as described... The accessories are sort of a mixed bag though.The filters and extra lenses seem good. The filters come in a rigid protective case and the extra lenses have bags and caps to keep them safe. They seem like decent quality, though I haven't used them much. The SD cards are class 10. The remote shutter control works and is compact.The big tripod is a bit unstable, though passable if using it with the shutter remote and it's not being used with a lot of movement around it. It comes with its own bag and is light and compact. The flash is cheap, but does have slave functions and would work best as a slave flash with a diffuser with a better flash on the camera itself. It does have a tripod mount too, so maybe that's a use for this wobbly tripod or the tiny table top thing.I would have paid a few bucks more for a half decent bag, this one is garbage. It's too small with no pockets or pouches and it is barely padded. The table top tripod is so tiny I'm not going to risk even trying it with this camera. I have no idea why this SD card wallet thing even exists, I guess to try to make up for a junk bag that has no pockets. I would rather dig through the bag looking for loose SD cards than use this thing...Haven't used the cleaning kit or the screen protector. The latter I probably won't use. Both seem generic but passable.Overall I think this is an OK value. The bag is worthless, so just order a new one with this purchase. Maybe just use this bag to store the mini tripod, the card wallet, and the screen protectors...", "Date": "June 8, 2014"}, {"Title": "great camera lots of unnecessary stuff", "Author": "Josh", "ReviewID": "R2O10S9BGNWY7W", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "i love the camera! takes great pictures, and the lenses focus rather fast. alot of what comes with it isnt needed or is junky. both tripods went in my trash. but it wasnt a bad price so it didnt bother me any", "Date": "June 4, 2014"}, {"Title": "perfect purchase", "Author": "Walter Liberman", "ReviewID": "R3MLDL3K9YYOXY", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "It's my first experience with this type of camera and turned very good, the combo is perfect.
