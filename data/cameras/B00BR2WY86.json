{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Great Camera", "Author": "L68stingray", "ReviewID": "R2ZMEB9LWGWPRD", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This is a step up for me, I owned a Nikon D60 which I purchased in 2008.  So far the camera has exceeded my expectations.  It is easy to get started taking great pictures.  I downloaded the user manual to my iPhone so if I need to find out about a feature I have it with me all the time and I don't have to carry around the manual.  I will put it to the test on a 15 day Caravan from Orange County, California  up to Oregon and then over to South Dakota before returning home.", "Date": "June 9, 2013"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": "$1,739.95", "Features": "KIT INCLUDES 12 PRODUCTS -- All BRAND NEW Items with all Manufacturer-supplied Accessories + Full USA Warranties:\n<1> Nikon D7100 Digital SLR Camera & 18-105mm VR DX AF-S Zoom Lens (Black) + <2> Nikon 70-300mm G VR AF-S Lens + <3> Nikon Digital SLR Camera Case +\n<4> Transcend 64GB SDXC 10 Card + <5> Spare EN-EL15 Battery + <6> Vivitar 67mm UV Glass Filter +\n<7> Additional Vivitar 67mm UV Glass Filter + <8> ML-L3 Shutter Remote Control + <9> HDMI to Mini-HDMI Cable +\n<10> PD 6pc Complete Cleaning Kit + <11> PD Memory Card Storage Wallet + <12> LCD Monitor Screen Protectors", "Name": "Nikon D7100 Digital SLR Camera & 18-105mm VR DX AF-S Zoom Lens (Black) with 70-300mm VR Lens + 64GB Card + Battery + Case + Remote + 2 Filters + Accessory Kit", "ImgURL": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51UTsHpm4HL._SY300_.jpg", "ProductID": "B00BR2WY86"}}
