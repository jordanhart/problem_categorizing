The only problem I had was the battery charger. It ended up being faulty. But the company \"Cameta Camera\" replaced it without hesitation. They send me a new charger with 1 day shipping. I am satisfied with everything the bundle came with. The remote pictured is actually different than the one I received. The remote I received was bigger than the one in the image. No complaints though because it actually looks cooler. The camera bad is very cheap feeling and looking but not bad for a beginner. I would recommend this for others. Great price for what you receive!", "Date": "September 1, 2013"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": "Unavailable", "Features": "KIT INCLUDES 12 PRODUCTS -- All Items Include Manufacturer-supplied Accessories + Full USA Warranties:\n<1> Nikon D3200 Digital SLR Camera & 18-55mm VR DX AF-S Zoom Lens (Black) -Factory Refurbished + <2> Transcend 32GB Class10 SD Card + <3> PD Digital SLR Camera Case +\n<4> PD 2.5x Tele & .45x Wide Lens + <5> Vivitar 52mm UV Glass Filter + <6> ML-L3 Shutter Remote Control +\n<7> Precision Design 58\" Tripod + <8> PD SDHC Memory Card Reader + <9> PD 6pc Complete Cleaning Kit +\n<10> PD Memory Card Storage Wallet + <11> LCD Monitor Screen Protectors + <12> Image Recovery Software", "Name": "Nikon D3200 Digital SLR Camera & 18-55mm VR DX AF-S Zoom Lens (Black) with 32GB Card + Case + Tripod + 2 Lens Set + Accessory Kit (Refurbished by Nikon USA)", "ImgURL": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51aDIBNLYSL._SY300_.jpg", "ProductID": "B00CAXQBEO"}}
