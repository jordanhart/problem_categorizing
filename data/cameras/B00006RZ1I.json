{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Cool camera for a cool price!", "Author": "buyer \"buyer\"", "ReviewID": "RANF1NBOLI3RY", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I just bought this camera from Circuit City for a 150 bucks during the friday after thanksgiving sale.. It is a great value.. It has 3x optical zoom (something you will find only in expensive cameras) as well as 2x digital zoom. As far as the picture quality it is great, with crisp colour images especially in the highest resolution..Pros:1. Great picture quality2. Very cheap (Relatively good brand)  I tried a camera called Argus before The difference is huge!!3. The LCD is very good.. I recommend a screen protector (you can buy one from those sold for PDAs and cut it to fit the LCD).4. It uses SD cards (better than CF cards)5. Nice case!6. Super Easy installation , Windows XP detected it without even using the installation CD.I gave it 4 stars because of the following drawbacks:1.  The lens cover is not automatic (You have to put it and take it off manually everytime you want to use the camera and it looks bad when it hangs of the camera (like the 50s style).2. It uses non-rechargable batteries, 4 batteries are included though.3. A little bit bulky (not like the more expensive sony and cannon).4. 8MB is OK however 16 MB would be better.. I have a 128MB SD card so that solved my problems...In short:This camera is good if you care about the functionality and don't care about the appearence. (It is not worth spending a [X] to get a better looking sony or cannon). If you have rechargable batteries and an SD card, I think you won't have a problem with this cam.", "Date": "November 29, 2002"}, {"Title": "Excellent Entry Level Camera", "Author": "Ken Smith", "ReviewID": "R1CDMM8WNZLCZ6", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I purchased this camera about 3 months ago from Circuit City on a store special for [money]. It was my first digital camera (though I have used friends digicams before and I own a camcorder) and I am very happy with it. I initially did not purchase the memory card and just shot pics with it and uploaded them to the computer before the batteries died (held about 30 800x600 high res pics) but I bought a 64MB memory stick after about a month and it was well worth the [money]. I use the 800x600 mode (high res, the camera supports both 1600x1200 and 800x600 in three resolutions; high, medium and low) and now get about 300 photos per memory card, far more than I need. The 3x optical zoom is an excellent feature as is the manual override for lighting, flash and white level. I have not used the video mode since I already own a camcorder, but for still images, this camera is great. It presents the internal photos to the computer as a removable disk drive (under Windows) which is also awesome ! I strongly recommend this camera for first timers or those who want a cheap digicam they can tote around to the beach, etc. Battery life is usually about 100 pictures (if you turn off the LCD) which is quite good. You can also view internal photos on the LCD and zoom then 2x and 4x which is quite handy. Picture quality is very good.", "Date": "December 27, 2002"}, {"Title": "Great Camera", "Author": null, "ReviewID": "R3NZBMF9VS91F1", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "For {the money}, this camera is definitly worth it.  I find it very easy to use and the pictures look great.  I have taken pictures indoors, outdoors, in dim lights, etc and they have all turned out great looking.  This camera does eat up batteries quickly, rechargable batteries are a must for this camera.  I have nothing bad to say about this camera.  I searched for a long time, asked alot of questions, and read alot of reviews on the net about this camera and I'm glad that I purchased it.  If you are looking for a good digital  camera and you budget is just under two hundred dollars I don't think you will be disappointed with this camera.", "Date": "March 12, 2003"}, {"Title": "Best Camera", "Author": "cagrimes", "ReviewID": "R1GUMZ653RZM03", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I bought this camera for an online course in computer graphics and this camera was the perfect tool. It has many functions and modes as well as a 15 sec video capture. The picture quality is nice and this camera is really easy to use. The only withdraw is that it guzzles batteries.

I haven't had any problems and I'm very pleased with the quality of pics this camera gives. I have had no problems with grainy pics, or taking pics indoors or out. It also has a great red eye reduction feature and I never have to do touch up to get the red out of eyes.I did purchase rechargable batteries because it does go through regular batteries quite fast. But since I've started using the rechargable batteries, I've had no complaints!I really believe it's how you use it and what you're using it for on how you'll feel about this digital.

It sounds great.  Unfortunately my tests at using it indoors produced poor results.  The pictures (on any detail setting) suggested that they were taken using a 256 colour mode or worse.  Images were grainy and transition between similar colours gave an unnacceptable pixelated effect.  This camera was supposed to be an upgrade for a Creative Labs PC-600 1.3 megapixel camera.  Comparing the pictures showed that I should have stuck with what I already had.", "Date": "February 26, 2003"}, {"Title": "LOOK FOR ANOTHER BRAND BATTERY EATER", "Author": null, "ReviewID": "R2GGYS5MEV0SF7", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "HAD IT FOR 1 YEAR AND DROPPED IT ON THE FLOOR, NEVER WORKED AGAIN.In addition the battery life is about 30 pictures and indoor pictures are not good at all", "Date": "March 10, 2004"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": null, "Features": null, "Name": null, "ImgURL": null, "ProductID": "B00006RZ1I"}}
