{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Excellent image quality, full controls and pocketable", "Author": "Michael Sandman", "ReviewID": "R1UJFMADX2W7HQ", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "If you're looking for a pocketable camera that has reasonably high quality images, lets you control aperture, speed and focus and shoot in RAW format, this is it.  I bought mine as an upgrade from a previous small but versatile camera, a Canon Powershot S70.The Powershot S95 was introduced in August 2010 as a slight upgrade to the S90, which was widely praised for its image quality and excellent interface but criticized for being hard to hold (\"like a bar of soap in the shower\") and for having a control dial that turned too easily.  The S95 fixes both problems and adds a couple of other features in a package that fits in the pocket of your jeans (if they're not super tight).  The case is metal, and although there are no finger grips on the body, it's not slippery at all.  It feels like it's covered with super-fine sandpaper (like 1000 or 1500 grit, for those you who know what that feels like).The second major complaint about the S-90 was that the function selection ring on the rear moved too easily. The ring on the S-95 has a slight click when you move it, and it doesn't move unless you want it to.There are a couple of other cameras of this type, including the Panasonic LX-3 and LX-5 and the Samsung TL500.  They all have let you control camera functions, and like the S95 they have 10 MP sensors that are almost twice as large as a typical pocket camera, so the pixels on the sensor are larger.  That lets them gather light more efficiently, which reduces digital \"noise\" when you shoot in dim light.  Image quality is noticeably better than photos from typical pocket cameras.  You can make an 8 x 10 or perhaps 11x14 enlargement, although a digital SLR will be significantly better for larger prints.  They also have f/2.0 lenses at their widest angle, although the aperture closes down as you zoom in.The Canon has two advantages over the Panasonic LX-3 & LX-5.  First, you really can put it in your pocket or in a belt case no bigger than the one you use for a mobile phone.  Second, the interface is a brilliant re-thinking of how a very small camera with a full set of controls should work.  There's not much room for buttons on the small surface, but you don't have to get into a multi-level menu on the LCD, and yet changing settings is fast and intuitive.For example, there's a ring around the lens that you can grip easily to control zoom, or, shutter speed, or aperture, change ISO, or manually focus.  You select what you want it to do by pressing a button on the top, and when you look at the LCD screen you can see what it's programmed for.  There's a selection wheel on the back for other functions, and when you move it, a clear set of choices appears on the screen. The selections are context-appropriate, so they change depending on whether you've set the camera for aperture control, \"Program\" control, etc.The two Panasonics have the same sensor as their Canon equivalents, but they offer a slightly wider lens (24mm vs. 28 for the S95).  The LX-3 has a much shorter telephoto - only 60 mm.  The LX-5, which was introduced a couple of weeks before the S95, has a 90mm telephoto, and you can buy an add-on optical viewfinder.  It also has a flash shoe in addition to the pop-up flash, although you can buy a dedicated add-on flash for the S-95 to supplement its pop-up flash  The LX-5 is about 25% more expensive than the Canon S95 (and 60% more with the optional viewfinder) and while it would fit in a coat pocket, you can't stuff it into a trouser pocket.If you want a truly pocketable camera that gives you good image quality and full control over your photography, the S95 is an excellent choice.", "Date": "September 9, 2010"}, {"Title": "Great camera and upgrade to superb S90", "Author": "Thomas McLean \"absit iniuria verbis.

What an improvement!", "Author": "Amazon Fan for Many Years", "ReviewID": "R7VPW73E93XPC", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I spent two or three months doing tons of research to replace my old Canon SD870. Finally a month ago I decided to buy the S90 despite the fact that it didn't have 720 HD video, it was a one-year old model, and many reviewers disliked the looseness of the control dial. My S90 arrived in the middle of August and over the course of many days I learned how to use all the functions and was very pleased with the results.And then on August 19 Canon announced the upcoming release of the Canon S95. I immediately returned my S90 and anxiously awaited the arrival of its successor. Earlier today it was delivered and I've been using it all day.I must say that I wanted to love the S90, but the smoothness of the body annoyed me. I figured I'd just have to get used to the slipperiness. But now that I have the S95 in my hands, I can't believe what a difference the matte finish makes regarding secure handling. There's no way you can appreciate the difference if you haven't handled both models yourself. Honestly, that feature alone is worth the slightly higher price.Control dial issues? No longer! Subtle click-stops have solved that problem.Finger missing the shutter button on the S90? Well, the geniuses at Canon took care of that, also. You won't mistake the shutter button on the S95 for any other button due to the distinct and secure feel.I'm in love with this camera. I won't go into details about picture quality because it's as good as its predecessor; there are examples all over the Internet. And of course the S95's 720 HD video is a big improvement over the standard video of the S90.Only one \"con\" I can think of: The new, smooth, elegant display on the back is no longer recessed therefore you'll have to be careful if you place the camera face up on a flat surface. In that position it appears the screen will come in direct contact with the table's surface.", "Date": "August 31, 2010"}, {"Title": "A lot more to be wanted", "Author": "GS \"I don't like sales tax\"", "ReviewID": "R2Q3CWOXGN4VD6", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "This is my 5th Canon (G2, S30, A530, XSi) and is supposedly Canon's best ever P&S.;  I bought this for its compactness, low light performance, and image quality.  In these regards I would say it is excellent!  But for its price I would expect something that is top of the line on most aspect which I found out not true.What I don't like and wish the Canon Guy take note (most serious come first):1. Most people complained about the flash design which is true and very very annoying.  I have gone through 2 trips and 3000 photos. I still get surprised whenever the flash turns active and push my left index finger out.  The camera has safeguard measure so that whenever it detects that the flash movement is blocked it will stop and issue a warning signal.  The only way to reset it is to switch the camera OFF and then ON again.  I have gone through this procedure around 10 times a day during my trips. Because of this I expect the first thing to fail for my S95 would be the flash. And I would not expect it to last as long as my G2 (9 years and still going strong). CANON GUY, PLEASE MAKE THE CAMERA A LITTLE TALLER AND PUT THE FLASH FIXED IN YOUR NEXT VERSION !!!2. The internal micro-processor is too slow and the firmware design cannot handle real time event.  In layman terms, S95 responded too slow in every aspect.  One example is after I finished a shot and then quickly turn the front wheel to change exposure compensation and prepare taking another shot, I found out the camera did not respond to my front wheel adjustment at all.  It had to wait until it finished rounding up the previous job (and it took a while to finish!) before it has time to register any change on the wheels and buttons.  So if you acted too soon it will totally disregard it.  The killing part is the processing usually take long. So beware user: don't think you can shoot like a professional fast and quick between photos, you have to pace yourself and make sure u don't press buttons and adjust wheels too fast. CANON FIRMWARE GUYS: PLEASE SET UP AN EVENT QUEUE AND USE INTERRUPT TRIGGER TO RECORD ALL USER'S INPUT, SO THAT THEY CAN BE PROCESSED LATER, MY PANASONIC ELECTRONIC RICE COOKER DO A BETTER JOB THAN S95 IN THIS REGARD!!!3. This one is the deal breaker.  It cannot auto focus during video recording!  This make the video feature seriously handicapped. Althought S95 has small lens and a deep depth of field, you still find the video constantly out of focus when your kids are running around you while u r shooting them. I thought I would have spent $400 and get something that can at least do good photos and video.  Well, it can only do half of it and I guess I have to wait for something better in the near future.  Just for reference my $100 Samsung can autofocus during video recording!!!4. WB and some other adjustments not allowed to work in most SCN modes, which make the SCN shooting modes seriously handicapped.5. My favorite Stitch Assist Mode (for taking panoramic-view picture) works only in landscape, not portrait mode.6. The rear dial is much improved over the S90 (not as loose) but still easy to turn by mistake.  I have many occasions of changing the ISO from AUTO to 3200 by mistake.  When I find out it is already too late and I got a dozen grainy photos!7. Battery last only 100-150 photos in practical use and so need at least 2 batteries for a day's photo.  If you are doing video, expect to bring half a dozen !!!8. The image stabilization (IS) is not very effective.  I closely examined the LCD screen images when IS is both engaged and not engaged.  The difference is very subtle and nothing compared with Rebel XSi (SLR) in which the image motion is obviously smooth out and slowed down.  The salesperson told me don't expect any serious IS capability from P&S;' I wonder if that's true.9. The lens is fast (F2.0) at wide end only.  But at zoom end it is very slow (F4.9).  My G2 has F2-F2.5 throughout the whole zoom range.  I can understand it's a limitation imposed by the size of the lens, not Canon's fault.  Coupled with an ineffective IS, I got a lot of blurry pictures at max zoom under cloudy sky outdoor.  I have very steady hands and I hold my breath when I press shutter, and my wife could do much worse. I wish Canon would put a better but little bigger lens in the next version. F2.0-3.5 would be a good compromize.In summary, you would think the S95 is wonderful when you play with it shortly at Best Buy.  The picture quality and LCD's display quality are superb too. But when you bought it home and put it to use in real life, you will find out a lot more to be wanted and that it's too far from being perfect at all.  Some shortcomings like the video focusing are in my opinion a design fault, others are inconvenience and annoyance.  The Canon Guys should have done much more than just a touch-up of S90.  I waited a long time and paid $400 for a camera like S95 and thought this would be the ultimate pocket P&S; that will last me a long long time. Well definitely it is not simply for reason like the half-cooked video recording capability.  FORTUNATELY OR UNFORTUNATELY, ALTHOUGH WITH ALL THOSE SHORTCOMINGS, IT IS STILL THE BEST POCKET P&S; ON MARKET, NO OTHER BETTER CHOICE YET.In my opinion Canon still makes the best digital P&S; and I might stay a Canon buyer in the future.  But my advise to Canon is to stop abusing loyalty of fans like me.  And make products that really live up to its name.  For those who already got a decent P&S;, I would recommend hold your purchase until S99, S100 or whatever which at least solve the flash and video fault.=====================================================================Update 8/1/2011After 10 months and 5800 shoots, the lens stuck midway while power on. Manufacturer replaced the optical module. This is my first Canon that needed service within 1st year of purchase.  A little disappointed and worried.", "Date": "October 20, 2010"}, {"Title": "a little realism", "Author": "~-->FM<--~", "ReviewID": "R2LGNJS6XL95OG", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Let me begin by saying that I think many of the \"negative\" reviews here are from people with unrealistic expectations.  I have had the s95 for a couple of months now (and I see it has come down in price) and think it is a great little camera.  Some people may think it is supposed to be a \"wonder camera\" that will turn you into an amazing photographer that produces professional quality DSLR images and will still fit in your pocket!  Well, it's not that.It is a camera that is just a little too big to fit comfortably into the pocket of my jeans, but that is alright because I would rather keep it in a case that I can clip to my belt or that my wife can easily throw into her purse.  It does fit very easily into a loose shirt pocket of a side pocket of some cargo pants.It is a camera that is capable of producing uncompressed RAW images (not too many choices in this size that can do that), and/or compressed JPEGs.  For most people the JPEGs are fine, for some the RAW is a major draw to the s95.  Even in JPEG mode the images are great.  I am coming from a several year old point and shoot and this thing is better by far. Some people argue that this or that camera/phone takes images of equal quality when shooting JPEGs...  this might be true (phone cameras have come a long way) but can your phone shoot in RAW?  No?  okay then quit your whining.Does the s95 make me a GREAT photographer? NO.  I am still as good (or bad) as ever, but the s95 does give me several tools to use that go a long way to help me become a better photographer.Movies:  good quality.  Far better than I expected and stereo sound.Part of the reason I got this camera is to take pictures of my daughter as she grows.  Right now she is 9 months old.  If you set it on \"kids/pets\" it is nice and fast but you give up creative control for the shot.  If you are using some of the great and plentiful manual features there is sufficient lag to be a little frustrating if you are trying to catch a fleeting smile.  Not anything that would make me want to return the camera, and certainly due to my abilities as a photographer... like choosing a faster ISO, or a wider aperture setting, or using the flash.Battery life is fine.  I actually thought it is quite good.  I guess I am not one of those people who has to check every shot and watch ever little movie over and over again while it is still in the camera.  I am more of a \"sort it all out later\" kind of a guy.  I give a quick check to see if I got a decent shot or not, and my wife will look at the pictures we took at the end of the day (the s95s display is awesome for this), but that's it.  The battery lasted a couple of days for us with fairly heavy use.  We did buy a second battery, and I am glad that we did but only because it is really convenient and pretty cheap (if you buy an off brand).  Certainly the battery life shouldn't be an issue for anyone.I gave serious consideration to the Panasonic/Lumix for this purchase but thought that if I was going to spend that much I should be getting into the micro 4/3rds realm.  That will probably be my next camera purchase once the tech evolves a bit more, and prices are a little lower.Bottom line for the Cannon s95:Great (semi)small point and shoot camera!Not a miracle worker, not a revelation, just a solid performer with a lot of manual controls not found on most other point and shoots.Value:  Pretty goodI don't feel cheated having paid $399, now with the price at $366 you can get a spare battery, a SD card and a case and still get out the door for under $400!  Not bad.Cheers", "Date": "November 13, 2010"}, {"Title": "Simply Amazing", "Author": "Surfseventy8", "ReviewID": "R24DIPOZRCZUFL", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "When I first saw the S90, I was quite intrigued by the amazing low light performance.  As a dSLR shooter, I've become quite used to shooting at ISO 800 and above with virtually no noise.  I hate the look of photos taken with tiny, on-camera flashes.  They are very unflattering so I try to shoot with natural light as much as possible.  I've had a few older, basic point and shoots and eventually moved up to the G9 but they all had the same issue: tons of noise on any photo shot above ISO 200.  With the larger sensor size faster f/2.0 lens and advanced in-camera noise reduction processing, this seems to do just fine at ISO 1250 and 1600.This camera definitely rocks.  The small size means that it's easy to keep in my pocket at all times.  My other camera is a Nikon D700 with a huge, heavy lens that I hate to take out just because of its size.  The S95 is giving my pro camera a run for its money.  The picture quality is great and the in-camera scenes give you so many options as well as full manual mode.  Shutter lag is virtually non-existent.  The LCD screen is bright and fairly accurate as far as colors.  My last Canon, the G9, had a purplish tint to the LCD and didn't display colors properly.  The S95's screen is polarized which makes it much easier to see in bright sunlight.  The downside to this is that if you wear polarized sunglasses, the screen goes black when turned horizontally.The ergonomics of this camera leave a little to be desired.  It's not easy to turn on or off with one hand and i'm always struggling with how to hold it while shooting.  I find that I press buttons accidentally.  I suppose that's to be expected on a camera that's this small.  I'm also less than impressed with the HD video.  The picture quality was great considering it's a p&s; but it is a little jumpy since it only records 24 fps.  Battery life is a little short, 1/2 a day of shooting (about 150 photos, a few >1 minute videos and some playback).  If you plan to take this camera on vacation, do yourself a huge favor and get a spare battery.", "Date": "September 8, 2010"}, {"Title": "Simply Superb", "Author": "RonAnnArbor", "ReviewID": "RZ4MOY1Z5AVQR", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I've become quite the compact camera expert of late, buying for myself as a backup to a dSLR, but also for colleagues and employees.Simply, the new Canon s95 is the best quality compact I have used. It's out of stock in a lot of places, but shop around -- even the Big Boxes seem to have them right now (don't pay the overinflated prices some marketplace vendors are asking).Having recently used the Panasonic Lumix LX5 for a week in Paris, I wish I had the s95 instead. The Lumix was returned the day I returned. It quite simply is not a compact camera, and stayed in the backpack more than any other compact camera would have.The S95 by contrast, has identical IQ, fits into a pants pocket, is small, and easy to use. The settings are quickly changed either through the menu, the mode dial, or the front ring. The small tweeks between the S90 and the S95 actually make a world of difference -- and it's a fine fine high IQ compact camera.Compared to a standard pocket camera, though, you might might find the zoom range quite limiting. It's better than the Lumix, but only just. It certainly is not capable of superzoom -- the optical zoom works to 3.8x -- but with digital zoom you can get to 15x. Those photos are unusable. The digital zoom is fine in a pinch for a \"must have\" shot, but they are all pixilated and blurry one you get into the digital zoom range. If you are looking for a superzoom, this camera is NOT IT.But with the 10 mp size of photos, you can easily crop down, and the IQ is so fine that it will still look clear and sharp at normal printing size up to 10 x 8 for super cropped shots.I've been very happy with the S95 and have used it all weekend for several hundred shots. I am consistently surprised at the excellent IQ in almost all shooting situations. (There does seem to be some flare when shooting into sunlit situations). I see no chromatic aberation, no vignetting, and simply clear shots. The IQ is fine across all scene modes. Some of the creative modes are fun. The bokeh in depth of field shots looks great.IF you are contemplating between the older s90 and the s95, there is no comparison -- you will NOT be happy with the s90 once you see what the s95 will do.Quite simply, this and the Lumix LX5 are the best compact cameras on the market as far as high-end IQ and features. Either camera will do a great job with low-light shots up to 3200 (note that noise is still quite visible with both cameras, heavy at any ISO above 800 but also noticable in anything over 400 ISO with either camera).Still, for the money, the features, and the sheer compactness, there is no other current camera that matches the S95. Highly recommended.Pros: Great low-light shots; up to 3200 ISO; great IQ across most shooting situations; very compact and small; easy to use dials and menus. Good ISO.Cons: Limited focal-range up to 3.8x only (up to focal distance 105). Anything shot in digital zoom is unusable. No grip on body.

I'm sure we'll all have additional comments once we've had some more time playing with it.* The body is slightly slimmer.  However, the body finish is much grippier than the S90.  A much welcomed improvement.* The front ring feels similar to the S90.  Not much changed there.* As we all already know, the swapped Ring Function and On/off button placement is a long asked for change.* The thumb placement removal from the back makes the entire back look much more pleasing but I'm not sure it will please everyone as some people actually like the extra thumb rest.  Personally I like this new look and with the grippy surface, it doesn't detract from handling.* The shutter button is a bit redesigned and feels better when using without looking.* The buttons on the back feels tighter with more precise finish.* The rear dial, which received the most complaints from users of the S90, has received a welcome improvement as it will no longer move from just you breathing on it. It's tight.* The flash movement seems better than the S90.  Less hazardous.  More rounded edges help reduce the pinch.* There are now stereo mics in the front below the lens.* Too bad the camera will not focus nor will it optically zoom when filming like the Panasonic LX5.* The 720P is only 24fps which is another disappointment as panning as well as fast moving subjects will be jerky.* There are also a whole host of additional functions such as HDR, Hybrid IS for close up as well as distance IS, focus tracking, tilt lens, face timer/smile shot/smile shot, simulated fisheye etc.  Not sure if I'll use all of these.* Finally and the most important point, the images don't look all that better than the S90 so if you don't mind the handling problems or slight video enhancements you may want to save a few bucks and just get the S90.Perhaps the S100 will be a better time to upgrade from the S90 for those who already own one.", "Date": "August 31, 2010"}, {"Title": "Manufacturing or design flaw????????", "Author": "Mark", "ReviewID": "R2PDMPY3LXEXHS", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I've had several small \"pocket\" size Canon cameras and have enjoyed them as something quick and convenient as an alternate to my DSLRs. I was very interested in the fact that the Canon s95 had the ability to produce \"raw\" files and shoot in low light with a relatively fast lens. The day I purchased the s95,  I was able to test it in some very low light conditions, shooting both stills and video with stereo sound. The results were very very impressive. The second day that I had the camera, I lucked out with a combination of dramatic weather and lighting to further test out the image quality. Once again I was very impressed. The third day, seeing a spontaneous photo opportunity, I pulled out the s95 and pushed the \"on\" button. I was immediately rewarded with a \"lens error restart\" message, making the camera unusable. Searching through the manual and the internet for solutions proved fruitless. I took the camera back to the nearby BestBuy, where they have a fourteen day return policy. Leaving the store with another new Canon s95 I was able to try a few more test shots, again getting great results. A couple days later I shot about six photos and a two or three short video clips. Later in the day, encountering another interesting photo situation, I pulled the camera out and had another \"lens error restart\" message. As the camera was non working and not user correctible, I returned this camera to BestBuy, turned down the offer of still another Canon s95 and opted for a refund. I was extremely frustrated by this as when the camera worked, I absolutely loved it's handling and image quality. Since I had two cameras quickly break down, with very little use, I have to suspect that Canon has a severe manufacturing or design flaw in this camera. When I Googled \"Canon s95 lens error restart\", i found out that a number of other people have had the exact same problem. Luckily for me, it happened within the 14 day return period.

The software is a bit buggy as it crashes, lags, and even macro button not doing what it is supposed to do. The menu system is also extremely convoluted as it is an overgrowth of the same old powershot menu since 10 years ago--the structure should have been completely revised rather than layered with hidden tag-ons.It also has flash control problems (pretty serious slow sync failures), pretty inept AF (hunts and misses a lot especially in low light), dead sensor pixels, subpar video quality, and the jpeg compression that generates a lot of artifacts (including low ISO's), something my older LX3 can easily trounce. The quality control as some mentioned here and elsewhere is also problematic, as there were dusts in the paints and scratch on the lens barrel trims on mine, not to mention hot/dead sensor pixels in both video and photo--hardly what you should expect for the money. Buyers should beware: despite the great name Canon has made for itself, they really have been taking advantage of this rather than building on it.That said, there's probably no smaller camera with this size sensor (1/1.7\"), not to mention it's also a Sony EXMOR backlit CMOS, which gave it such great low light capability (and probably also artifacts). However, any decent low end DSLR should easily beat its image quality, just out of physical property of the sensor size alone (this is still about 1/5 the size of a micro 4/3 chip, or about 1/9 the size of a APS-C as found in most DSLR or some newer EVIL cameras like the Sony NEX-5). It's not quite a DSLR replacement, but rather a pocket camera for sticklers who can't suffer loss of image quality along with weight and size. The perfomance to size ratio is unique to S95, even with all the aforementioned drawbacks.FULL REVIEW:Canon isn't my favorite brand these days because it appears to me that they've been lazying around for a while now just because they are Canon; i.e. they have loyal fans who are often blind to their faults, so they weren't even trying. To me S90/S95 was something of an exception, in that they sensed (or rather, forced to recognize) the desperate need for a low light, high image quality, yet still compact performer (which is surprisingly absent in today's saturated digital camera market), and responded with a semi-sincere effort. Like many others, Canon decided to employ a larger than average sensor for better light capture(average point and shoot sensor size is 1/2.5\", S95 is at 1/1.7\" which is almost 50% bigger area than average, and similar to LX3/LX5's 1/1.65\"; still way smaller than APS-C or micro 4/3s but the latter would require much larger bodies. For an excellent reference and visual comparison of these sizes, search \"image sensor format\" in Wikipedia). Additionally, they seemed to have borrowed the excellent and innovative backlit CMOS sensor from SONY for even better low light capability. While these features aren't unique to S95, what made it stand out is how Canon managed to squeeze that with a fast f/2.0 wide angle barrel lens into a body  that's barely larger than a standard point and shoot. (for size comparison, the upcoming and much larger G12 supposedly uses the same sensor found in S95).I purchased a s95 because my outgoing LX3 was still too bulky (almost the size of a micro 4/3 camera with much less image quality to justify it), but otherwise I liked it a lot. I felt that Panasonic is so progressive and on point with their consumer camera line that Canon's by comparison is looking tired and confused. In fact Canon S90 was their answer to Panasonic LX3's phenomenal success in some ways, but screwed up big time when they didn't include HD video and had some serious ergonomic issues. Even S95's video looks a little contrived and noisy, which is one of my gripes. The lack of ultra wide like 23mm is also a glaring omission (though it probably preserves better optical consistency since it's so thin).However, Canon's still has among the best colors (that other makes like panasonic just can't quite match yet, in general), and on S95 they threw in some nice exposure features like contrast enhancement that really worked in correcting tricky lighting situations by artificially extending the dynamic range. The auto pop up flash looks like the ones on Panny LX series, but it goes up by itself, controlled electronically via the menus rather than a mechanical toggle switch. I thought it was cool until it started pushing my fingers around, since it's located in a convenient place where one tend to hold the camera, and often so abruptly and forcibly it almost ejected the camera out of my hands.There are some quibbles I--being somewhat anal retentive--have about this camera's quality control, something that seems to have been a constant nag with Canon's Powershots. Details like the paint isn't perfect on mine, with bubbles and hair/dust trappings in both of the two S95 I received (which is in stark contrast to Panasonic's impeccable finishes across their lines--and I've owned two LX3 and other lower end Lumix's), scratches on the lens barrel's metallic trims, and the CMOS showing some dead/hot pixels in RAW files (not the LCD display but the image sensor) uncorrected and unmapped (Canon admitted it's faulty and sent a service ticket). I had hoped being \"Made in Japan\" and a higher end pocket-able would mean extra attention to build quality from Canon. Alas, that evidently just isn't the case.The AF performance is also remarkably poor, often missing the foreground subjects or faces even with bright light, or completely misfocuses in low light even with assist lamp. Despite that Canon's pocket cameras had suffered from this issue before, this is still surprising, not to mention frustrating, for a camera of this class (by contrast Panny LX series's AF certainly does noticeably better). Nevertheless, despite the less-than-tact-sharp lens and miserable jpg compression (that maybe circumnavigated by shooting RAW and post process in computer with software), the camera excels in high ISO performance, color saturation/accuracy, and exposure control.The above referenced \"miserable\" JPEG compression is probably worth special mentioning because it really saps excessive amount of quality away from the original image as seen from the RAW files. Canon only had two JPEG compression modes (fine and normal), and both are equally horrible. I think it behooves you to try processing the RAW files (which isn't that easy as many popular imaging softwares still don't recognize the RAW output from S95 as of October 2010) and you will see how much detail is lost. This loss is expected in JPEG files, but in the S95 it's especially remarkable. I feel that they should have had at least a better compression mode or algorithm as the \"fine\" setting produced results that didn't do the camera justice--it can do much better, and it shouldn't require laborious RAW post processing to achieve.The control rings are really a draw for me as I yearn for the traditional and straight forward camera controls. They do work, though not nearly as straight forward, since their functions often change depending on which level of menu or function you were at. You simply cannot take your eyes off the screen to figure out what is going on. It's still the same Canon interface that's been around since the first digital Elphs a decade ago, and frankly I'm thinking that should really be drastically updated or completely revised to fully take advantage of these two rings, which by themselves a great concept in the right direction. As for now, with the convoluted menu (there's main menu, and then there's a function menu, not to mention all the function keys with their own sub menu--like flash button--and in it more subset of control keys and wheel assignments: you get the idea) the control rings are really little more than (rather laggy and confusing) fast toggle key selectors, most of the time. That isn't bad, and with ample customization options it is arguably better than directional buttons, but it can really be so much more.Battery life felt short out of the box, but it definitely improved after only a few charging cycles, typical behavior of fresh lithiums. It still felt short to me, as I often couldn't complete a day of shooting without the battery running out. However, I haven't been fair, as in the most recent excursion, it again ran out of power on me before I liked; yet this time I paid attention to the number of shots taken: I squeezed 458 photos out of it, many with daylight flash fill (high power drain bright flashes), slow sync indoor flashes, probably 20% with RAW(RAW copies not counted), 30% with exposure bracketing (3 consecutive shots), and almost a dozen short HD videos (highest power drain). I think even if it's not amazing, that's still pretty good and respectable for a camera of this size. Numbers are more convincing than my subjective feelings in this case.I (and many others) thought it was a big flaw when it didn't have at least 720HD video on S90, when AVCHD is already making its way onto consumer cameras and many competitors already have very good 1080p (e.g. Sony's TX), ideally merging a dedicated HD camcorder and high quality photo camera. It's an improvement on the S95 that now it supports H.264 720p 24fps video in stereo, but for the price segment it was almost not enough. As a point and shoot S95 is probably an overkill (although the incredibly well engineered AUTO mode is nearly foolproof, or the very mission and purpose of AUTO modes); but if you want to play with creative manual controls, RAW capability, one of the best color processing, true pocketability, and don't mind the so-so HD video, it is truly one of the best pocket cameras on the market in absolute image quality and low light performance.Update: 10/22A few things that's worthy of a firmware upgrade, or at least users should probably demand for one:- Besides the convoluted menu controls which really slows things down at times--exposure bracketing as another example, would require you to exit all menus (the button to exit can be menu key or set key or a combination of keys, depending on where you are, often leave you fidgeting just trying to clear the screen), click the exposure compensation key, and then click the display key for bracketing, and then rotate the wheel for bracketing range; after shooting, repeat to cancel--not exactly the easiest or fastest for a pretty important function, even with those wheels. It really feels like the dated menu of other powershot cameras, or the kind that threatens you with missing the \"decisive moment\" if you are ever presented with one. The response of the flywheels or the menu button also isn't very direct. There's a significant lag between the wheel or button click action and software response. It's like \"rowing\" through a menu list rather than wheeling through them, which kind of defeats the wheels' potential. In other words, the software is a bit slow (or euphemistically, \"not fast enough\") for a high(er) end camera. The pretty menu transition effects (yes it's minor but it's there) also gets in the ways of speedy response and should have had an option to remove (as on some other powershot models).- Manual mode, in combination with live exposure preview, has become my favorite as the two wheels finally gets more dedicated functions as in classical camera setups, and allows this design innovation to truly shine--I can scarcely think of other similar sized cameras with better simultaneous shutter/aperture control. However, it crashed several times within the 3 weeks that I've owned it. The screen would just go black with the lens still extended, and I have to wake it up using the power button.- The slow sync flash is extremely inconsistent. Sometimes using fill flash in low light background situations get better results which is very strange (as the shutter should be so fast that backgrounds should be darkened). I haven't figured out what rhyme this slow sync goes by, but it often wouldn't brighten foreground subject enough, or at all (it would look as if the flash was off, and I was certain the subject was within the flash's range), and other times washes out the foreground subject with overexposure. I have tried first or second curtain sync, adjusting flash power (which kind of worked but not always predictably), neither really worked. It should be much less painful than this.- Ever since Digic 4, or probably even before that (but with DIGIC-IV processing being rather obvious), Canon's post processing tend to generate a smooth, glowing skin tone. I think this is one of those \"innovations\" several manufacturers (Fuji had one too, to the rave of Japanese/Asian beauty magazines) were able to pander to the public as a favorite feature of particularly (fashion conscious) females. It sometimes can miss, however, and make the skin tone look rather unnatural (or, without offense to those who like this feature, as if the subject's got dipped face down into a bucket of makeup). This is present on S95 as well. Even if it's not always as terrible, I sure hoped the post processing would lean towards verisimilitude where possible, particularly since it's a higher end model.- Preview exposures on screen which is a very useful Canon feature that helps tremendously when you are trying to manually set exposure controls (by contrast LX3 didn't have this). However, exposure preview (via darkening or brightening the screen) would simply go away with any of the flash modes switched on. It's okay and makes sense since it's hard to predict the outcome of the flash without firing a test burst. However, in slow sync mode, and especially manual mode, it would probably be a good idea to give an option for preview since the background would depend on exposure settings rather than flash exposure. I can't find options in the menu to change this behavior. You are left with the meter which is still okay, I suppose, but it's just another one of those UI inconsistencies that you have to think on your feet to work around (e.g. when you got used to exposure preview, you may think because you can see the results on screen that it'll appear on flash photos, which is often untrue particularly for slow syncs).- Wind noise filter in video mode doesn't seem to make any difference after some tests (and no I didn't always just blow straight into the mic to test it, but real life situations where it's often just a gentle breeze). As the mics are in the front, it's very easy to get wind noise in this camera. (11/7 addendum: tests reveal the wind filter is just a simple frequency equalizer, in that it reduces the mid-low bass frequencies typically present in wind noises; i.e. you still hear wind noise, but it has reduced bass frequencies.) That, and video compression can use some quality options, because while the results aren't horrible per se, they don't look as good as a 720p with autofocus should, even at 24fps. (also why can't they give us AF or zoom during video? I'm sure they CAN do that--CHDK was able to do it on basic Canon Elphs--and I wouldn't mind the AF/zoom noise as long as I can get the subjects in focus/frame.)- The audio pickup from the two microphones are less than underwhelming. Despite being \"stereo\", the sound it picks up is completely devoid of bass, making everything sound tinny. I have tested it on full frequency range speakers, so I'm pretty sure it's not the speakers but the way the sound was recorded. I don't know how Canon managed that, as it's pretty hard to imagine what happened. **11/7 addendum: tests reveal that it's the wind filter, which seems to be just a equalizer that attenuates the mid-low bass frequency range that is present in wind noises (but you can still hear the wind noise, just not as bass heavy). For fuller audio range response, the wind noise filter needs to be switched off.- a strange thing that I've discovered is that the macro button doesn't seem to do anything to the focusing range (in all modes; in AUTO it's supposed to auto detect a macro shot). In other words, I could focus down to the 5cm minimal distance with or without the macro mode on. It doesn't bother me, as it's more convenient than having to jump through hoops (of that dreaded menu) and take my eyes off the subject to get a macro shot. However, it can also be the probable cause of why AF hunts so much and misses so often. It also makes me wonder if the software is as finished as it should be. (the slow sync problem is also highly suspect)Another few s95 differences/improvements from S90 off the top of my head:the body is a nice matt/rough finish to help with grip (the same finish used to be on S90's top plate, now it's reversed with smooth finish on top of the S95 and rough around the body). it's like the Ricoh GR finish which I like.the lcd adds glass panel for duability and dust proofingthe zoom toggle and shutter button is now specially shaped to avoid confusionthe rear control dial now has a clicky feeling to prevent accidental adjustments (which was the most complained problem in S90)720HD H.264 video with stereo soundhybrid image stabilization (2 axis instead of 1)support of SDXC cards?some claim a new sensor? but i doubt it. It's the same larger than average Sony EXMOR backlit CMOS sensor employed in several other brands' high end consumer models, credited for the superb low light performance.The new HDR mode isn't really that useful, in that it really REQUIRES a tripod, as the processing cannot line-up the image thus any movement would render the results useless. Better off with just exposure bracketing and post process in the computer.Some worthy competitors considered:FUJI F300EXR - Also features a break-through sensor technology with phenomenal low light/high ISO performance, excellent wide angle optics, and manual controls. The innovative sensor is slightly smaller at 1/2\".SONY TX/HX series - Compact yet also with the EXMOR sensor technology employed in Canon (but smaller at 1/2.4\"). Limited manual controls on some, TX's folding lens suffers in optical quality and no RAW capbility, but much better (incredible in fact) video and loaded with software shooting features.Panasonic LX3/5 - Extremely well rounded high end \"compact\" camera that's quite popular and already a classic. Uses Panny's own inhouse sensor at 1/1.63\" with excellent results. However it is significantly more bulky that it's not truly \"pocket-able\" except for likes of cargo shorts pockets; and with its popularity, significantly pricier.Update: 12/16Adobe Camera RAW 6.3 and Lightroom 3.3 updates are released. These updates support the S95's RAW format. This is important if you have been waiting to process all those RAW .cr2 images. It also resulted in a few things that I can observe: - The proper crop information is supplied, resulting in raw files with cropped borders (seems to crop quite a bit, or the same crop percentage as the jpeg results; also distortion correction is applied, contrary to RAW files produced in some other cameras, like the LX), removing the large left black edge area which was previously present and showed some bright pixels.- Proper color information is now readable, making post-processing much easier. Canon has one of the more accurate color information from RAW files, and relatively easy to process in my opinion.As it is serving as my full time go-anywhere camera, this review maybe updated continually.", "Date": "October 6, 2010"}, {"Title": "Buy it.  Its flawless!", "Author": "Amazon Customer", "ReviewID": "RIQT419WXN7R4", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I bought this camera on launch day after reading the glowing reviews of its predecessor, the S90, and seeing that all of the complaints about that camera were fixed in this new S95 model.  I received the camera 2 days before a 2 week trip overseas to Scotland and on pure faith I left the DSLR at home and just took this Canon.I was absolutely blown away by this camera.  Its fantastic.  Image quality is stunning.  The camera starts up fast, it nails the exposure metering shot after shot, colors are vibrant, sharpness is good, and the fast f2.0 lens means quick shutter speeds even in low light.  On top of that, image stabilization works well and the low-light performance is great. Just set your exposure metering to -1/3.  For whatever reason, Canon's default setting tends to overexpose by +1/3.Battery life is decent, and the included charger is travel friendly with folding prongs.  Get yourself a second battery if you are going to be shooting more than 200 images a day or taking lots of video.HDR mode is nice, but you will need a tripod or table or other steady location.  If you have that, HDR mode can deliver really spectacular images in high-contrast situations.  HD Video is solid too.  I was worried about the 24 FPS but videos look fine as long as you aren't panning around like an over caffeinated monkey. And if you ARE panning around like an over caffeinated monkey, 30 FPS won't help you much.The cameara also starts up quickly, being ready to take a picture less than 2 seconds after you power it on.But what I really fell in love with were the controls - the two control rings let me have all the control I would normally have with a DSLR without forcing me to dig through complex menu systems.

For family gatherings, often the same lens, but I have the Tamron f/2.8 medium zoom 'wedding lens' that works pretty well for that kind of thing as well. I find I don't really use my long zoom very much--just the occasional concert or sporting event, and even then I'm more into the Tamron.Now, I said all that because I wanted to tell you this: probably 75 percent of all my 'keepers' come from the S95, not the big rig. I don't use a case for it--my front pants pocket is its case. It goes everywhere with me, such that any scene I used to use my iPhone 4 to get I now have this pocket wonder to get a real shot of it. It has a very fast 2.0 lens (at the wide end), good low light performance (low-light photog with an SLR is a mixed bag that is highly lens dependent), it is less costly than a single decent SLR lens, and it does almost everything my G12 does while fitting into said pants pocket.I've hung onto the G12 because I was sure I would still use it even though I had the S95 now. But the S95 gets virtually every shot the G12 gets, minus a tiny amount of zoom and a built-in ND filter. I use Lensmate's ingenious bayonet system to attach inexpensive 37mm filters to the s95, giving me all the added capabilities that a good ND or graduated filter can provide. The filter case lives in my car's glove box and I generally don't carry it with the cam--but since so many of my photo opportunities happen when I'm near my car, I can add the graduated filter for high-contrast scenes or the ND filter for sunlit scenes and really extend the already super capability of the little camera that could.You will notice that you can't get as sharp with the S95 as with a bigger, more expensive camera. NO SURPRISE THERE. But there is no camera in its price range that will get sharper, and it is definitely sharp enough for stunning images. The physical controls on the s95 give you full control of shot parameters with minimal drilling into menus. You can do a quick white balance correction in 5 seconds. You can take a focus or exposure bracket. You can shoot in RAW. You can gather so much light with the f/2.0 lens that a white balance-corrected candlelit scene will look almost like the lights are on. You can do a lot of this with many other p&s; cameras and any SLR with the right lens. But at this price point there isn't much else that can do this, let alone fit in your pocket (oh, did I mention the pocket thing again? Sorry).What you don't get with the S95 is zoom capability. I find for most of what I do, the big zoom is unnecessary, and I try to shoot at full wide when indoors to take advantage of that fast lens. For the average camera consumer out there, the two stats that matter are megapixels and zoom range. \"What, your camera only has 10 Mp and a 3.8x zoom? A child's toy. Look at this bad boy. 16 Mp and a 20x zoom. How about that?\" If you must have the long zoom you will be shopping elsewhere, and I understand that; I have a long zoom too and it is necessary for certain applications--over water, from high vantage points, photographing animals you'd just as soon not get any closer to, your kids' sporting events. But you'll find yourself leaving it at home more, and missing great shot opportunities.I would say the s95 makes a stunningly great second camera--but the truth is it is usually my first camera with the T2i and thousands in glass being my second camera. I drag the monster out when I anticipate photo opportunities--weddings, holidays, family reunions. Plus, any SLR is better at catching fast-moving kids or athletes. But out on the street or on the road or in the woods, the S95 gets me the shot I would previously have only had my phone for. And with this great lens/sensor combination, those shots are really good.You'll find room to grow on this camera. If you take photography classes and read photography books, you'll be able to learn a lot with this machine while mulling investment in more expensive photo gear. In my opinion the G12 is nearly obsolete with this machine. The only feature of the G12 I honestly miss is the built-in ND filter and the overall handling speed, which is a tiny bit quicker on the G12 plus you have tactile controls for all your shot parameters which makes it faster-handling. But the s95 does not suffer for lack of controls. You can still adjust all relevant parameters on it very quickly with the front control ring, 'shiftable' rear control ring and assignable custom button (I keep it on AE Lock, which the G12 also has as a dedicated button).Oh, and there is one other \"feature\" of the G12 missing here: a handle. Canon has focused so much on miniaturization that they have forgotten a human must hold the s95 to get those shots. I installed Richard Franiec's excellent anodized grip--an almost exact texture, color and material match to the alloy body of the camera. So between the Lensmate bayonet filter adapter and the Franiec grip, my s95 is pimped. I must say I am a proponent of that grip. Canon has cut into Franiec's business somewhat with the introduction of a small rubber grip indentation on the new s100, which also gets the built-in ND filter.I've seen early-adopter complaints about Canon's execution of the s100's new miniaturized 12.1 Mp CMOS sensor though. They're saying they got better shots with the s95 in virtually all lighting conditions. Personally I think Canon is just months away from a firmware upgrade on that camera that will correct the differences in the sensor and it will be a good one. It better be, for north of $500.If you want the best pocket camera in the world right now, you are looking at it until Canon fixes the sensor on its successor.I love my s95; I go nowhere without it. I have a cheap case I use when I'm not carrying it--but when I am, it comes out of the case and into my pants pocket, the better to be ready for the moment.If while reading this review you realized your photographic priorities are substantially different from mine, you may have lost some interest in the s95. If you found yourself intrigued, you may want to look more closely at it, especially at today's prices. This was a $400 camera not so long ago, and worth every penny. There are myriad options out there; many that can do most of what this camera can do plus a whole lot more--but with more bulk. Others that are smaller but less capable. If your taste runs to the highest gettable image quality in a package that fits in your pocket, you should own one of these.", "Date": "December 9, 2011"}, {"Title": "Excellent purchase", "Author": "Mikey likes it", "ReviewID": "RD1NR6I4WNBBJ", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "There are several reviews from people who are disappointed that the S95 isn't the equal of a dslr. Anyone who expects it to be should not buy this camera. It is, however, is the closest thing to a dslr that will fit in your pocket.My plan was to buy a good compact first and use it to supplement a future dslr. Now that I've seen what the S95 can do, I may just scrap the dslr idea altogether, since the S95 is definitely good enough to be used as my \"main\" camera. The S95 is simply the best truly compact camera available right now. It takes near-dslr quality photos and is small and unobtrusive enough to always be with you. Sure, a dslr outperforms any point and shoot, including the S95, in low light, due to the much larger sensor and bigger pixels. The S95, however, handles low light shots better than any other compact (the sensor is almost twice as big as the typical compact's). I still may eventually get a dslr for more speed and lens flexibility, but in all likelihood, I wouldn't use it nearly as often as the S95.I'm in the group that believes \"if it doesn't easily fit in your pocket, you'll need to carry it separately anyway, in which case you might as well get a dslr\". The LX-5 is too big to fit in a pocket, comfortably at least, and though it looks better on paper, the IQ isn't any better than the S95's, based on the samples I've seen. Canon's jpeg engine is better than Panasonic's, so unless you shoot everything in RAW, the S95 produces better pictures. M4/3 cameras don't make much sense to me (no offense to M4/3 users)...only slightly more convenient than a dslr (you'd still need to lug the body, lenses, etc. around in a bag), yet there's a significant compromise in IQ and the cost is similar to that of an entry level dslr setup.Two flaws (or intentional omissions) in the S95 are the lack of focus during video and lack of a superfine jpeg mode. Canon will probably include these features plus a couple more in next year's model, causing many to upgrade. Hey, how else could they afford all of that R&D;?Due to its quality and convenience (which means this camera will get a LOT of use), I'd say the S95 is also a good value, despite the rather high price compared to other compacts. Anyone thinking of buying one, keep checking Amazon and wait for a deal. They often drop the price for a day or offer freebies. Got mine for $50 off and the deals will only get better as the holidays approach. Others have gotten theirs for under $300 when factoring in the special offers.Tips: save $$ buy buying a Maximal Power spare battery ($7; at that price I should have bought two) and Transcend Class 10 SDHC card (I got the 16gb for $25) These items would cost 3 to 4 times as much if you were to buy an OEM Canon battery and Sandisk card instead. Virtually no difference in utility, per the reviews. I use a microfiber eyeglass pouch when carrying the S95 in my pocket and the Case Logic TBC-302 ($7) for storage/travel. Fits perfectly.", "Date": "November 13, 2010"}, {"Title": "Small camera with a big heart (sensor)", "Author": "Tony J.", "ReviewID": "R35YSUXQ3HG4E7", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This is, without a doubt, one of the best compact cameras in the world. What makes it so great?Pros:+ Large 1/1.7\" sensor. One of the main reasons why DSLRs look so much better than compacts is the size of the sensor. A larger sensor has two main benefits. One is reduced noise at the same ISO, allowing you to take pictures in lower light. For ordinary compacts noise becomes a problem even at ISO 200, but DSLRs can go all the way to ISO 1600. Another is bokeh, or the quality of out-of-focus areas. When you take a portrait, you want the background to be blurred so that only your subject is in focus. According to physics, a larger sensor allows for a narrower depth of field, and hence more out-of-focus backgrounds. The S95's sensor is about twice as large as a typical compact's 1/2.5\" sensor, so it has half the noise. It's still not large enough for good bokeh, even at f/2, but you expect that of a compact.+ Full P, A, S, M modes. (Canon calls A Av and S Tv, but same thing.) These modes are very important to serious photographers because they allow more creative control over the image, such as setting exposure compensation (+/-), shutter speed, aperture, ISO, etc.+ Two customizable control rings, one on the barrel of the lens and one on the rear. DSLRs have dials so that you don't have to dig around in a bunch of menus to change options. With one flick, you can set ISO and +/- in P mode, aperture and +/- in A mode, shutter speed and +/- in S mode, and aperture and shutter speed in M mode. However, you can program them to a variety of different options based on your preference.+ Customizable shortcut button, which you can set to easily access a bunch of menu items. Personally I have it on white balance.+ RAW mode, which allows the photographer more control over the end image. You can open it up in Adobe Camera Raw and edit it in Photoshop, or use the provided free software to process and edit it. RAW is great for recovering highlight and shadow detail which would have been lost in a JPEG.+ Fast f/2 lens. Most compacts have maximum aperture of f/2.8, so the S95 lens can let in twice as much light as other compacts. Combined with the larger sensor, the S95 has about four times the low-light performance of regular point-and-shoots.+ Small form factor. Small enough to fit in a pants pocket, you can enjoy your trip/party/event without dragging along a bulky DSLR.+ Shoots movies in 720p with stereo sound.+ Customizable ISO Auto. ISO Auto sets the ISO automatically in order to ensure a fast enough shutter speed, and you can set the Max ISO Speed and Rate of Change. I normally keep it on 400 and Standard. For landscapes, I use 400 and Slow. For parties, I use 800 and Fast.+ C mode, which remembers all the settings on the camera and can be accessed via the mode dial.+ My Menu, allowing quick access to five menu items of your choice.+ Exposure and focus bracketing, which allows you to take three pictures with different exposures or different focus settings in order to ensure you have a correctly exposed/focused image. But more importantly, exposure bracketing can be used for HDR (blending different images of the same subject in Photoshop to get a correctly exposed final image).Cons:- Limited zoom range. The lens only goes from 28 mm (wide, but not ultrawide) to 105 mm (medium tele), by 35 mm equivalent.- f/4.9 aperture at tele end. You lose about 2 2/3 stops of light compared to f/2 at the wide end.- No hotshoe. It would have been nice to be able to add an external flash for more power and to allow bouncing at an angle, though I suppose a gigantic flash on a tiny camera would look rather ridiculous.- Body is a little bit slippery.- No 1080p, if you really want Full HD video.Neutral:o Decent battery life. Its Canon NB-6L battery (3.7 V, 1000 mAh) is rated for 200 shots. In practice, I've only taken 120 shots in a row without a charge and haven't had the battery die on me, so the battery life is sufficient for me. I know that other premium compacts often have more robust batteries, so that might be a point of consideration or you could just get a spare NB-6L.o 10 MP resolution. Don't believe the megapixel myth which states that the more megapixels, the better. The last time I checked, Sony is coming up with a 16 MP point-and-shoot which is really excessive. The problem with more megapixels is that now they have to squeeze more pixels into the same area, so less light hits each pixel, and with less light you get more noise.o Made in Japan (actually a very weak pro). It's always nice to know that your camera is made in the country with the best quality control in the world. However, I haven't heard any complaints about Canons made in China, so I suppose the advantage is marginal at best.o Pop-up flash. On one hand, it allows the camera to be made smaller instead of having a flash directly on the front. On the other hand, it's annoying that you have to move your finger whenever the flash pops up.Compared:o With the Canon S90: The S95 fixes the problem of the loose rear dial rotating too easily by adding some soft clicks in it. Also improves video to 720p stereo (compared to VGA mono).o With the Canon S100: The S100, which was just announced, improves the lens as both ends, to 24-120 mm f/2-4.9. It now has a 12 MP CMOS sensor with DIGIC V processor (compared to 10 MP CCD with DIGIC IV). I don't believe the first two will have much effect on image quality, and we'll have a few months before the S100 ships to see how good the DIGIC V really is. The S100 also adds GPS tagging and 1080p video. It now uses a NB-5L battery (3.7V 1120 mAh) and adds a rubber grip to the front. The S100 also lets you zoom during videos.o With the Canon G12: This is where it really matters; the previous two were just versions of essentially the same product. The main differences are ergonomic: the G12 is much bigger and has better build quality but will not fit in your pocket. The internals are very similar, as both use the same 10 MP 1/1.7\" CCD. The G12 has the same lens control ring but also has direct +/- and ISO dials on top, and adds an optical viewfinder. The G12 has a 28-140 f/2.8-4.5 lens, which gives you a bit more reach on the long end. The G12 has a hotshoe, if you need an external flash. The G12 uses a much bigger NB-7L battery (7.4V 1050 mAh), allowing for 370 shots.o With the Panasonic DMC-LX5: The LX5 also has a 10 MP 1/1.7\" CCD (actually 10.1 MP 1/1.63\", but they're virtually identical). It features a Leica 24-90 mm f/2-3.3 lens, so both have 3.8x zoom but the LX5 is wider on both ends. The LX5 has a much larger aperture at the tele end (f/3.3 vs f/4.9). Both have 720p video, but the LX5 allows zooming and manual control during videos and has better video IS while the S95 has a less leaky CCD (sometimes purple streaks can show up in video mode for a CCD). The LX5 is slightly larger and slightly more expensive. However, it lacks the unique dual control rings of the S95, which are invaluable to me.Overall:If you are a photography enthusiast who wants to travel light, this should be your top pick. You can get the G12 for more features and better build, but you'd be spending $100 more on average and sacrificing the small size. (Think about it, if you really want to go all in why not bring a DSLR?) The LX5 is also a great camera and you should consider it if you prefer its lens and video quality, but the S95 is more pocketable and features dual control rings offering quick, menu-free manual control. You could also wait until November to get the S100, but until then we can only guess at whether it's a worthy upgrade from the S95.", "Date": "September 20, 2011"}, {"Title": "Pocket-sized camera with manual controls", "Author": "Amit Patel", "ReviewID": "R3CPD9P9NJBEZV", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I got this camera to replace my Canon SD880. I had considered getting the S90 but decided to wait to see if they fixed some of its usability issues. With the S95, they have.I was looking for a camera that fits in my pocket, so that I can keep it with me all the time. I don't care about megapixels but I do want a good lens and sensor. As I learn more about photography, I wanted a camera that gave me a little more control than what most pocket cameras offer. In particular, I wanted good control over aperture, shutter speed, and exposure. The S95 gives me all of that, plus bracketing, RAW support, shallower depth of field, high ISO (simulated 12800), manual white balance (blue/amber, green/magenta), flash settings, sharpness, and a few other settings that will help me learn more about the technical aspects of photography that I wasn't able to try out with earlier pocket cameras I've owned.There are also some features that might be interesting to try out: HDR, tilt-shift effect, stereo sound in movies, HD movies, movie wind noise reduction, focus tracking, face smile/wink/blink detection, saved custom settings, shadow correction, and some special effects. However, these aren't the reason I bought the S95.Some cons: no viewfinder, thick (fits in my front pocket but not back or shirt pocket), small battery (estimated 200 shots), slow HD movies (720p, 24fps), no time lapse mode (although the tilt lens movies are time lapse), no front grip (although Richard Franiec's custom grip should be available soon).If you're looking for a camera that fits in your pocket and gives you control over aperture, shutter speed, and so on, this is a good camera for you. If you don't care about pocketability, there are larger cameras to consider (like the LX5 or G11, mentioned by others). If you're looking for good movies I would look at the SD4000 or EX-FS10 instead. The S95 barely fits into a pocket; look at it in person before deciding whether you'd want to carry it around in your pocket. If you're looking for simplicity or thinness, this is not the camera for you. If you're looking for good macro or good zoom, other cameras (like the SD880 I previously used) are better. I would not recommend this as an upgrade to the S90 unless the usability issues are driving you mad, and if the usability issues don't bother you, you can save a bit of money by getting the S90 instead of the S95.

I was initially attracted to the LX3, and after reading hundreds of reviews from people far more knowledgeable than myself decided that the Panasonic had the edge on features (JUST!).However the deal breaker for me was the size of the S95, although it has a photo quality comparable to many DSLR's, it easily fits in my jeans pocket (even inside the recommended 'CaseLogic' Soft case) and is as small if not smaller than many other P&S; cameras. When comparing the size of the LX3 and this, it was clear that the LX3 is not as portable and is not 'jeans' pocket-able. I am using it for traveling so this was important to me.I will try and some up my favorite points about the camera after 1 week of playing around with it:PROS:- VERY Handy size- Extensive range of Pre settings that cater for any condition (the miniature mode is  fun to play around with, the effect of tilt shift built in)- Full Manual controls for when your are feeling more adventurous- Feels well made- User friendly controls and menus- Great image qualityCONS:- The placement of the pop up flash, as the camera is small you have to hold it at each corner. The pop up flash can take you by surprise as it is located in the upper left corner of the camera.SUMMARY:Fantastic camera and well worth the money in my opinion, if you are looking for a new high end P&S; in the same price bracket, spend a little extra and get this one, you won't be dissapointed.

I also wanted to experiment with video.The most appealing thing about this camera, to me at least, is raw processing so I can tune exposure, white balance, color calibration, and noise-reduction myself.  I rather not fidget with scene modes and such.  Also, the sensor is quite a bit bigger than most normal point and shoots.  It also has decent video, which is one of the main reasons i picked this up.  f/2 is nice as well.The s95 works similar to a DSLR, with Av, Tv, and M modes and spinning dials for adjusting things like aperture, iso, shutter speed, and even manual focus.  I really liked that.  As an aside, beware that AUTO mode is only in JPG, so even if your settings say RAW it will shoot jpg.  I've just learned to avoid Auto.For video, the s95 shoots 720p / 24fps.  Focus cannot be changed once you start recording.  But, the exposure and white balance will shift according to the scene.  You can fix both white balance and exposure before recording however.  I like to apply some software stabilization in post, which results in a slightly cropped video.  For that reason, the competing s100 (which shoots at 1080p) might be better.  Also, I believe the s100 can autofocus during video.  Either way, focusing isn't a big issue sinse the depth of field on these point and shoots are so deep anyways.  The S100 also has a 15% wider field of view at 24mm vs 28mm on the s95.The S100 is out now, so you might consider getting that too.  I got an s95 though since the image quality is about the same with the s100.  Early reports on dpreview.com even indicate the s95 has better image quality than the s100.  The fact is, if you are serious about imagery, you should just get a micro 4/3rd like the Panasonic GF3, NEX, or just go for a Nikon D7100 or something similar.  Currently, the S100 is about 50% pricier than the S95... so you have to ask yourself if that's worth the slight improvement in image to you.  For me, I'm recognizing that I've made a decision here to lose IQ for pocketability.  And when I really want good IQ, I'll use a bigger camera.  So to me, it wasn't worth it to pay a 50% premium for minimally better IQ with the s100.

By getting rid of it, I forced myself to use my DSLR (Nikon D90) for everything and all my pictures were great. After almost a year, my wife asked me to get a small camera as she does not like to carry that big DSLR around.I wanted to get something that would come as close to a DSLR quality in a compact camera. I though the Canon S95 would produce images comparable or close enough.I received my camera after a long week. I went on a trip around my state yesterday. I took my new S95 along with my beloved D90. Big mistake. The honeymoon ended as soon as I uploaded the pictures on my computer.I know this may not be important to most. But if you are a DSLR user and want a compact to leave behind your big camera, I suggest you don't.  Carry the big camera whenever you can. This will get you a good picture, but is not close to what you get with a DSLR. There is just no comparison, DSLRs are so much better. But everyone knows this.For those who are used to DSLRs this will disappoint you. However, if you are upgrading from a lesser compact then this is much better than what you are used to. Let me break this down from most important to least. For the two kinds who are considering this expensive little camera.For those looking to get this compact to \"leave\" their DSLR behind:Speed:This is fast for a compact but still not fast enough for sports, kids, or any kind of action.Dynamic range:A was used to blue skies. This would render the sky white where my DSLR would have it blue. In this regard this camera is like any other compact. I noticed same limited dynamic range with other pictures as well. I took side by side shots and this is the most evident difference, even during the day.ISO:Not close to APS-C (much less a full-frame) sensor. Images are usable up to ISO 800.Now for those looking to upgrade from a cheaper camera these are the advantages:Sharp Images:This camera produces images that are sharper than any other compact I have seen. Even when looking at 100%.ISO:ISO is much better than any other compact I have used. With most compacts, if you are taking pictures inside, you need to use flash. With this, you don't. TIP: when you do need flash, do yourself a favor and select the flash exposure compensation and bring it down a notch.Ergonomics:This camera is just a pleasure to use. Ring controls make it easy to change settings quickly. The flash is a big pain. It comes up where your fingers naturally rest. Be very careful with this..Conclusion: Should you buy it? As everything, it depends.If you are upgrading from a compact camera because you want a better compact camera, then this is much better. This is the best compact camera ever made.But if you are looking for much better pictures then you want a DSLR. For an extra 150, you can get a base model which is way ahead of this small camera in terms of image quality. Images you get from this camera are sharp but not much different than any other compact. IF you want a big upgrade then use a DSLR.If you don't take pictures often, a DSLR will be a better choice. I know people who, once they tried a DSLR, never use their compact cameras anymore. If you are used to DSLR quality, you should know that this is not even close.

I suppose they are within their rights to charge what the market will allow, just be aware that the MSRP of this camera is $399.00.", "Date": "January 4, 2011"}, {"Title": "A near-perfect compact for the serious amateur", "Author": "Jason M.

It was a bit over-budget.  I wanted to spend about $300 or less.  But no other camera seemed capable of offering me the manual controls that this model offers.My criteria were:1. Size (pocketability)...I don't want to carry around a bulky camera with accessories.2. Nice indoor photos without a flash.3. Some aperature priority controls.4.  Reliable \"auto\" settings for fast, candid shots of my kids.I handled all of the cameras in Best Buy and ultimately went above my price ceiling to give this one a try.  I love it.Rather than bore you anymore, I will list the pros and cons...just please note, the cons aren't deal breakers for me...I've just become really picky as a consumer and am always thinking of ways that products could be \"perfected\" (from my perspective).Pros:  small and pocketable, great \"auto\" setting photos, fun setting \"tweaks\" (my colors, fish eye lens etc.), manual controls and control ring, great low-light/no flash results.Cons: awkward flash placement...I'm having to learn not to instinctively place my left index finger where the flash pops up, too many \"tweaks?\"--there are a few superfluous settings you may never need (\"miniature\" setting for example).  And finally, Price.  I like it...but haven't seen a reason why it needs to be a penny over $349.This is my most valuable tip!

Freckleton", "ReviewID": "R2ZMCBBK5FUT6R", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I have been taking outdoor shots for many years. As a travel companion, I could hardly ask for a more applicable, decent little camera then the Canon S95.I actually owned a Canon S90 (previous year's model), which turned out to be my favorite camera for a time. For the curious, check out my site - scenicdesktops.com, just to see the kind of pictures I took with it.The S95 shares everything that made the S90 such a hit, with a few very nice refinements that make it into what I consider to be a close-to-perfect compact camera.The basics which both of these cameras share are:1. Excellent image quality. The sensor in this little camera is roughly twice the size in area of sensors found in most compacts of similar size (meaning pocketable). Combined with a bright lens (f2.0, at it's widest - where I often use it), it produces better highlights (clouds, etc) and shadows over a wide margin then what any of my older compacts could achieve or even get close to.2. Excellent controls. I love canon's approach. The control ring around the lens on the front is likely my favorite feature. Amazingly versitle and simple, it provides fine control over any one setting you choose, such as exposure, white balance, ISO, etc. Selecting the setting is easy, with a ring func button on top, and the control it provides is solid, with smooth operation and nice, audible clicks. A smaller, secondary control ring is placed around the directional pad on the back, which provides further control. A programmable shortcut button on the back simply serves to be assigned whatever function you wish. On the control dial at the top, a custom mode is provided which saves your exact settings to keep you from having to reset everything after turning it off.3. Nice menus. The quick menu (where most of the commonly accessed settings are) is nice, 2-dimensional simplicity, with clear, distinct options, and a layout you won't get lost in. The main \"menu-menu\", while more traditional, is also clean, and thankfully not riddled with numerous nested menus.4. Truly compact. The main competitors from Panasonic and Olympus, while noteworthy and with comparable specs, simply do not quite fall into the 'pocketable' realm, with their lenses and other features protruding out enough to disqualify each, imo. The S95 really is a pocketable camera, no doubt about it, and with credible specs to boot.Additionally, the S95 improves and adds upon an already excellent package:1. Improves the rear control dial. The S90's dial was loose and spun freely, whereas the S95 features 'clicks' which prevent accidental movement.2. The S90 had a slippery metal body; the S95 features a surface which is tackier and easier to hold.3. The S95 now offers 720p HD video; the S90 did not.4. The S95 now offers stereo sound with left and right michrophones. Even high end cameras generally lack this.5. The S90 only offered a single lanyard-link on the side; the S95 offers two, both at the top corners. This allows for a neck lanyard if desired.6. New modes such as HDR, as well as a greater range of options for the customizable buttons/rings.7. The S95 is slimmer then the S90 by a notable amount.With that said, it's not a camera that can 'do everything' - mostly because it is a compact, after all. It doesn't feature the huge sensors of large cameras that allow selective focus several feet away (for portraits, etc), or hot shoe mounts, pivoting screens, etc. None of these really belong on a compact. There are a couple minor nitpicks that I can point out. You can't control what the rear control dial does, for example - it defaults to whatever mode your in. You also loose most manual control when in a scene mode. I don't find these to be glaring or problematic, others may.As a side note, a company called Lensmate (no affiliation, promise!) provides worthwhile S90 / S95 accessories, such as a tiny 37mm filter holder that can attach to the front (I use a polarizer), as well as a small attachable grip that I think works perfectly, without compromising pocketability.Considering I would have given the excellent S90 a 5 star rating, the S95 gets this and then some.

This camera's compactness can't be underestimated.  The competitors may have better glass, wider angles, and better ergonomics, but they will be bigger.  A 1/4\" in depth and 1/2\" in length is a huge differnece in your pocket- CONTROLS: Classic Canon UI simplicity.  The ring is a smart move,and you can quickly reassign its functions.- MATERIALS: With a metal shell, this camera can easily take falls and impacts.  I'm confident this can sustain a sidewalk drop and keep going.- IMAGE QUALITY:  You can take photos in dimly lit rooms and still get sharp results.  Cafes, bars, and urban nightlife shots come out very well. I've never had a pocket cam capable of night photography like this one.CONS:- BAD LIVE PREVIEW:  No live preview of exposure changes.  This is very frustrating when trying to stop down 1/3 or up 2... you have to guess, which really makes this a useless feature.  Hopefully Canon will address with a firmware update.- BAD PAINT: While build quality is good, the paint is quite poor.  I stored the camera with my laptop in a bag and the paint rubbed off along the ring and on the corners.  Looks field-tested, but the paint should not rub off this easily.- ERGONOMICS: rear dial jogs very easily, sometime leading to over/under exposed photos.-SPEED: I have owned two Canon SDs and this one has a perceptable shutter lag which shouldn't exist at this price point.

I usually shoot with my 5D and an assortment of L lenses when I want and need quality, large prints and shallow DOF.

Remember the old saying...The BEST camera is the one you HAVE with you.Yes. I too debated getting it or the Panasonic LX5 but at the end of the day, I want something that will be as easy to carry and pocket as a cell phone. Plus I like Canon colors should I shoot in jpeg instead of RAW. The panasonic seems to have a magenta cast to their blues which make shots of skys a bit odd. Both cameras have their strengths and weaknesses but the S95 won me over with better pricing, colors in jpeg, HDR,  good low light capability and portability although I would have liked the 24mm wide angle on the Panasonic.Video is OK at 24fps and is fine for an occasional grab. It's a little choppy so you have to pan slowly. Forget about chasing the kids with the camera. But I have my Panasonic TM60 camcorder for times when I want to shoot video.

I use prime lenses and occasionally a stabilized zoom and I am not bothered by the size and weight of my camera equipment.  That said, I only take it with me to \"on purpose\" events and do not use it for \"snapshots\". I have and enjoy a Canon SX100is and it has served me well without a single complaint.  I bought the S95 to supplement my other cameras and I must admit, to satisfy my ego and my curiosity.  I have experimented with it within the last month and I do enjoy the performance of this little camera.  I like the option of using it as a creative camera, rather than a point and shoot on the green auto setting. I do not shoot video, ever. I can't understand peoples' obsession with short video clips and would use a real video camera if I was that into it. I did want a camera that I can be a little less careful with.  I hoped to free myself a bit from guarding the camera and have something to \"toss around\" like so many others do. I failed at that one.  The S95 is not tossable.  I guard it like every thing else I own. It's just too nice to rough up.  I should have known better.I purchased this camera instead of the Canon Elph 300HS.  It was a tough call as the 300HS is an excellent pocket camera and it is much lighter and smaller than the S95.  And yes it is probably \"tossable\".  I do not shoot RAW and do not have a reason to.  My purchase came down to one deciding factor, the lens.  At it's most wide angle, the S95 has a f2 lens, vs the f2.7 of the 300HS and the 2.8 of my SX100.  That is a full stop and that is huge.  It may not seem like much, but it allows me to use the S95 inside any reasonably well lit space without a flash.  That is often the difference between a photograph and nothing.  My primary purpose for this camera is taking photos at indoor family events and a flash is often intrusive.  I decided that this feature alone was worth double the price of the Elph 300HS.  I also could afford it.  If money was a bigger issue, I would have bought the 300HS for myself and been perfectly happy with it.  I bought a red 300HS for my niece for XMAS 2011 and she is thrilled with it. For typical outdoor photos, either camera will perform well.The S95 is not double the camera.  It works for me as I use it.  I believe that those disappointed in it have unreasonable expectations.  It is better.  If you can afford it, buy it or buy the S100.  You will love it. If not don't sweat it.  Buy what you can comfortably afford and don't forget to use your camera.  No camera will take wonderful photographs.  Only you can do that. Enjoy whatever camera you own and use it often.

What follows are general impressions from someone who shoots for fun, but seriously, and expects his camera to be able to perform to the vision in his head.First, the body of the camera is great. As others have said the grip is a little funky sometimes because your hand just doesn't want to quite stay where it's supposed to, but the finish on the paint helps alleviate that. The shutter button is easy to find without looking in it's recessed little area within the zoom knob, and the half-press is responsive to the touch. The scroll wheel on the back is lovely, with just enough grab at intervals to click into place without being over controlling or too loose, as was the case with the s90. I absolutely love the wheel on the front that surrounds the lens; because I shoot mostly in Av mode I can adjust the aperture on the fly with one hand and the ISO via the shortcut button and wheel on the back almost instantaneously, not to mention the satisfyingly old-school clicking it makes.Two body complaintsOne: If you are holding the camera with both hands, you may be surprised by the flash which is motorized straight up out of the body and will most likely be impeded by your finger. The solution, of course, is to avoid the flash as much as possible simply out of the problems of on-camera flash.Two: The mode selection wheel can be a little tricky, especially if trying to go in/out of movie mode which has a large gap between itself and the nearest manual mode, because it is rather recessed into the body and stiff to begin with. Except under the most perfect conditions I have to use m fingernail to turn it, which is more or less an inconvenience.Performance is what I really came here to talk about. There are plenty of reviews that rave over the great photos that come out of this camera, and they're all very true. What bothered me however was the intense barrel distortion that came out of the 6m wide-end of the lens. I first noticed it in my architectural pictures around Paris, where none of the features quite lined up right, and as time went on it started to drive me crazy. I started either using the barreling artistically as a slight fisheye lens or zooming to an (almost 50mm) 49mm equivalent, which kicks my max aperture to f/3.2, nullifying the beautiful f/2.0 real max aperture.After some research, I found CHDK, a program that non-invasively allows you to squeeze that extra bit from your Canon point-and-shoot. The s95 has many of the CHDK functions built-in, but one interesting discovery was the ability to write RAW files as DNG (Digital NeGative) files. When I shot a few DNGs at 6mm and viewed them on my computer, the barreling was absolutely horrendous. I discovered that the s95 does quite a bit of barrel distortion correction when writing JPGs to memory, though evidently not enough. The fix? Lightroom, my editing program of choice, has support for the Canon s95 starting at version 3.4 which allows one to apply lens-specific calibrations to any photo. In order to use this you must shoot in the default RAW mode, which involves more memory and time to write to the card when shooting, but the correction is absolutely unbelievable, and even editable after the calibration default is applied. Moreover, the noise correction that one can apply to RAW files in LR3 is far superior to the in-camera processing, with much smoother textures and crisper detail resolution.For this reason I give it a 4; if Lightroom is out of reach for you (student discount anyone?) or if CHDK is incomprehensible (which it shouldn't be with some work), then the camera performs great in and of itself. If you have these tools it is nearly perfect, with support for scripting via CHDK and much clearer high-ISO shots thanks to LR3 and RAW. It definitely beats lugging my dSLR around pickpocket-infested tourist locations just to get a unique photo.", "Date": "November 16, 2011"}, {"Title": "Rivals DSLR Pics in Certain lighting situations", "Author": "M.

I wanted a high quality, rangefinder like, digital camera to carry as an alternative to my DSLR. I picked this over the LX5 mostly because it was somewhat smaller and the many people carried it in their pants pocket. Frankly unless you have baggy clothes I did not find this to be a workable option(too thick and the lens would catch in the edge of my jeans pocket). I carried it in a Lowepro belt case(like my previous P&Ss;). I found the layout of the top of the camera and the motorized pop up flash quite annoying. The top of the camera is quite crowded making it very difficult to use your left hand to stabilize the camera. If you scroll over the auto or force flash setting the will flash pop up so if you are used holding the camera there you will have to adjust your style. The camera has a number of nice features which it should for it's price point and being billed as an enthusiasts camera. In everyday shooting, unless you use the raw processing and/or the extra stop, the photo quality in no better that my wife's Panasonic ZS5 which is about half the price. My main complaint is my camera failed after about two weeks(maybe 150 shots) I received a \"lens error\" and the camera just shuts down and says restart camera. No drops, no abuse, no scratches. Then I find out on flickr that this is somewhat common. To make the situation more unpleasant Canon reserves the right to replace my camera with a \"refurbished\" model. This does not seem like a fair policy to me.....  Buy a new camera and get a used one in return.  For it's price/ features I would rate this camera 3 to 4 stars.

Kress \"Andy Green\"", "ReviewID": "R2LP86XX60CUEL", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "First off, no camera is perfect. This camera isnt perfect but its the best \"pocket camera\" you can buy. Period. A lot of people compare this camera to the Panasonic Lumix LX5. The LX5 is an awesome camera but I dont consider that a \"pocket\" camera. It is bigger and bulkier and doesnt fit in your pocket very well. I would almost compare that camera to the Canon G11 or G12. The Canon S95 is simply the best camera if you are looking for something very portable and you can take anywhere with you. I have owned the S90 and now the S95 and its the only camera I use. I take it everywhere to capture my 4 year old in all his activities. I used to lug around a DSLR camera but didnt like it because it was so big and bulky (but it took awesome photos) I looked into this camera (S90 initially) and fell in love with it and its all I use now. The S95 is basically the same but basically three things got better. Video which was good just got better because its now in HD. The sound which I thought was very good just got better because video is now in Stereo. (two very tiny speakers are now visable on the front of the camera) The S90 was very sleek and some said too sleek because when you held it, some compared it to holding a bar of soap in the bathroom. It was very slick. The body of the S95 has a texture to it now that is better and not as \"slick\" to the touch. One thing I also like about this camera is it takes action photos a little better. The S90 \"sports\" mode took photos at a snails pace of about 1 photo every second basically. (DSLR's take about 4-5 per second and are very fast) The S95 does a little better at about 2 shots every second. This still is not very good but is acceptable for a camera like this and does help if you are taking photos of action, etc. Again, no camera is perfect but this is about as close as you can get until something new comes out next year. However, if you want an awesome \"pocket\" camera that can take great photos (especially in low light), has a very fast lens (aperture 2.0), can be used fully manual if you want and takes very good video clips, this is the camera to buy. I am sure next year there will be some more improvements with this camera or features added and maybe Nikon or someone else will come out with something comparable to this Canon S95 but it doesnt exist right now. This little camera is the best right now. You wont be disappointed and quit looking around for something comparable because it doesnt exist. The only other camera that I looked at is the Panasonic Lumix LX5. It is a very, very good camera also (maybe a little better then this camera) but it is bigger and bulkier and really doesnt slip into your pocket very well. It also takes photos very well in low light (aperture of 2.0 also) and has a lens that is wider 24mm compared to Canon's 28mm and takes photos at around 3 shots per second compared to the S95 2 shots per second but its a little bigger and about $50 more. I encourage you to look at the Panasonic but the Canon wins for me!! Good luck and quit worrying and buy this camera!!!Update: Here is a really neat \"letter\" that was written and posted on Yahoo the other day from an editor with the NY Times....I copied and pasted it into this review. Its good!Dear Canon S95,I don't often write love letters to gadgets. But you, you're something special.Truth is, I've been searching for someone like you for years.See, I love the huge light sensor that's inside an SLR. It can take sharp low-light shots without the flash. It can blur the background the way professionals do.I just don't like how an SLR is big and heavy and obtrusive.What I've always wanted is a little camera with a big sensor. Is that so hard?Apparently, yes. The problem is covering a rectangular sensor chip with a circle of light from the lens. Bigger sensor? You need a bigger camera. Those are the simple bylaws of physics.But you, oh, cute little Canon PowerShot S95! I love that you're a pocket camera, only 3.9 by 2.3 by 1.2 inches. I love your big, bright, three-inch screen, your built-in flash, your H.D.M.I. output for hi-def TV sets. I love that you turn on directly into Playback mode, without having to extend the lens.I love the unique control ring around the dial, which I can quickly program to adjust whatever feature I want: focus, zoom, exposure, light sensitivity (ISO), aperture, even degree of color saturation (all the way to black-and-white).I've had fun with your special modes, like the tilt-shift-lens simulator and fake fisheye.I love the wink-driven self-timer. Yes, I set up the camera, walk into the scene, and then wink-the picture is taken two seconds later. Beats hunting around for a remote control. (Or I can ask you to wait two seconds after a new person-that would be me, joining the group-enters the frame.)But above all, I love your enormous sensor. It's 0.59 inches diagonally-88 percent more area than most pocket cameras' sensors. And I love that you have an f/2.0 lens, a rarity among pocket cameras, meaning that you let in a lot more light.And all of this means that you, little S95, can take amazing, sharp pictures in low light without the flash. Your designers have shrewdly dropped the ludicrous quest for more megapixels-you have 10 megapixels, just right-in favor of something that really matters, like better photos.So many times I've used you for pictures at night, indoors, in shadow. Cathedrals, restaurants, parties. No, the results aren't as good as an SLR's-you still manage to blur a shot, especially in very dark situations when the subject is moving-but they're light-years better than any other pocket camera can do. I love to show off your photo samples.You're even better than my last love, your predecessor, the S90. Because you're slimmer. And now you take hi-def videos-with stereo sound. You have a high-dynamic-range mode, where you combine three tripod shots at different exposures into a single photo with a really great range of darks and lights. Your controls are refined in size and placement.Look, S95-I know you're not perfect. Your battery takes only 200 shots on a charge, which is very low. You won't let me use the optical zoom while I'm shooting video; in fact, you can't refocus while shooting video, either. (Your arch-rival, the Panasonic LX5, can zoom during video.

Monday I went to a local camera store and compared S95 vs S100 back to back including image quality on ISO 80 at 28mm & here is my impression: S95's image quality is noticeably superior, S100's image looks more washed out. S95's image is more consistent from center to corners but S100's image has 1 or 2 soft corners. At this focal point, S95's lens is brighter so has faster shutter speed. At ISO 800 both camera has pretty equal image quality but with such bright lens and good IS, you rarely shoot above 800 ISO. Unless you need the extra wide angle or slightly longer range I would choose S95 especially for the low price they offer. I do like the S100's better grip. I ended up taking the S95 home. I wanted to give 4 stars to the S100 but since it is 43% higher than the price of the S95 I give it a 3.Went home and compared S95 vs S90 back to back. Almost identical image quality except S95 has cleaner image processing at the darker areas due to an improve jpg processor. I also like the better ergonomics on the S95 and the price was $100 less than what I paid 1.5 year ago. Other notable improvement that was not mentioned in most reviews was there are more settings for Auto ISO: you can choose a slow ISO increase rate vs normal. In Program mode(P), the normal ISO increase rate was at 1/30\" shutter speed, but under slow ISO, the threshold is now 1/15\" which is very ideal for still or very slow moving objects in low light. This is just what I needed for the older S90 where under auto ISO setting, the camera wants to choose a much higher ISO than necessary thus produces poorer images, but now I just set it at slow auto ISO and let the camera choose the correct ISO.  I can also set a upper limit in addition to the auto ISO.

After doing much research on the best P+S cameras, I, like many others, boiled down the search to two: the Panasonic Lumix LX5 and the Canon PowerShot S95. By now there were many sites with articles comparing the two. In the end, I decided that the S95's significantly smaller, pocketable size was the dealbreaker. I had to sacrifice a wider lens (24 mm vs 28 mm on the S95) and shooting speed (6 fps vs 1.9* fps on the S95), not to mention the sexy Leica-branded lens (seriously!) but I decided that the more optimal size and low light performance of the S95 was worth it.So far I've brought it nearly everywhere, even to work since it is so pocketable. Note that it's still significantly larger than entry-level P+S cameras.PROS (notable ones I've picker out):+Gorgeous, razor sharp LCD screen+Control wheel, in addition to the rear dial, makes setting options much faster+Great image quality, with sharpness nearing SLR's+Built-in HDR mode is awesome for scenic photos+Simplistic, classy design+Very good low-light performance: ISO 3200 can make a room illuminated only by a monitor seem like it's taken during day (noisy though, but the colors were there) See pics.CONS (Improvements I'd like to see):-Pop up flash is very annoying, that's where my left index finger rests!-Aperture is pretty bad when fully zoomed in, at f/4.9 (though the lens is quite fast at the wide end at f/2.0)-Shooting speed could be better-Optical zoom could be better (only 3.8x)Conclusion: This is one of the best P+S cameras available with today's technology. Very soon the gap between P+S and SLR cameras will be bridged, though there are always factors such as optical zoom and depth of field that can only be improved so much due to physical limitations of a pocket camera.*You can use the low-light mode during day time, which shoots about 4 fps but at 2.5 MP size", "Date": "June 19, 2011"}, {"Title": "Professional photographer -- LOVE this camera!", "Author": "KatherineSD \"Katherine\"", "ReviewID": "R1NQF54Q66JO82", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Finally a pocket camera that I can use as a professional photographer when I am trying to take shots of people/street scenes without walking around with my giant Canon lenses!  I have been in the market for a small camera for years and have never been satisfied with the image quality until the S95 came out.  This camera is AMAZING.  It does about 90% of what my $3500 Canon 5D Mk II does.  It is an excellent point and shoot (great for my kids and husband, who don't want to adjust anything) but I love the fact that I can go \"all manual\" without a fuss.  I shoot in RAW but husband and kids like JPG for simplicity.  The images are vibrant and sharp.  Skin tones look natural.  Even in extremely low light, the pics are not grainy and have excellent saturation.  Focus in low light is spot on, something that is hard to achieve with most inexpensive cameras.  I have shown my photographs to my students and they have a hard time guessing if it's my $5000 Canon/lens or this $400 super-mini that took the shots....My only gripe is the ergonomics.  The flash pops up RIGHT where I hold the camera so it's a bit annoying.  Also, while the S95 has a more \"nonslip\" coating, it is not a rubberized grip like my big Cannon.  I would LOVE to see some rubber on the casing to help make sure it doesn't slip out of my hands.  Finally, on occasion the flash overexposes so I have the EV down -2/3.  That takes care of it.  I just leave it there and my pix are perfect.Cannot recommend highly enough, both to novices who want a great point and shoot and pros who want a small pocket camera that is less conspicuous than the usual \"gear.\"", "Date": "February 27, 2011"}, {"Title": "Best compact digital camera ever! (until the next great thing comes out...)", "Author": "Allan R", "ReviewID": "R3PP9PXKNK8GZH", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I've always wanted SLR quality in a compact digital camera, and this baby comes very close.  For daytime, good light photography, it's probably as good as many SLR's out there, and in low light, it's far and away better than any compact I've ever used.  The range of manual controls is impressive, yet the camera remains relatively easy to learn.  I especially like the programmable \"S\" button on the back, which can be programmed to 20 different functions.  I personally keep mine on AE lock (exposure lock).  With many other cameras, you have to move it around the scene until you find the right exposure, then half-press the shutter (which also locks focus), then recompose while keeping the button half-pressed, and shoot.  Kind of a hassle, and of course the focus is locked on whatever you locked exposure on.  With the s95, I simply find the exposure level I want, then press the \"S\" button, which locks the exposure.  Then I can freely move the camera and refocus on what I intend to photograph without having to hold down the shutter button, or lock in the focus.  And there are many other uses for the \"S\" button if you choose!  The front control ring is also programmable, being able to select from many options, including a custom option to create your own specific use.  The camera is highly customizable, but without being overwhelming.  It's fantastic!As far as performance goes, I have never gotten such quality images before.  The daytime photographs are incredibly clean and sharp, and the in-camera adjustments and IQ are great.  The light metering is generally good, as is the white balance.  And if you aren't satisfied with the white balance, there is a custom white balance mode, which renders indoor evening shots under lights perfectly, once the custom white balance is applied.  Apertures run from a fast f2.0 to f8.0, which can be used creatively in creating decent DOF photographs.  You aren't going to get SLR DOF performance with the s95, but you can create very interesting images at f2.0.  Shutter speed runs from 1/1600 to 15 seconds, perfect from getting fast action sports to perfect night time exposures.  And speaking of night time exposures, this camera produces outstanding images in very low light.  Using manual mode, you can create essentially grain-free long exposures, using a low ISO and slow shutter speed.  I have NEVER seen such clean night images in any compact digital camera before (assuming you can find one with manual controls!).  Even indoors, the camera produces very nice images, even with ISO's up to 1600.  I've noticed graininess starting around ISO 400, but that's at 100% view and nitpicking the shot.  Most family photos and indoor people shots are not highly scrutinized, so even ISO 800 and 1600 shots are usable.  WAY better than any other small camera's ability indoors at night, that's for sure!There is also a completely customizable mode, interestingly enough called \"C\".  You can program this to be set up any way you like it...so if you do a lot of specific shooting (night time, indoor family photos, lets say), you could set it up to have the shutter speed, aperture, ISO, etc, the way you like it.  That way, you don't have to enter manual mode or semi-manual and fiddle with the settings each time.  You have one full-time dedicated mode for shooting the way you like!And for those who just like to point and shoot, the auto mode is acceptable.  I personally use \"P\" mode most of the time, which is pretty much auto, with some control over settings.  But if you just want to turn on the camera and shoot, auto will still render high quality images, though sometimes I have noticed with auto mode the autofocus can give me trouble.  Using P-mode will still make it easy, but with some more reliable focusing.  Besides, hopefully you are buying this camera with SOME intention on learning how to manually create better shots...but again, even if you just want to use the auto mode, you will get photos much nicer than any other pocket camera, a reason to buy this in and of itself.There are so many more outstanding features to list...I could go on forever.  Autofocus tracking, 1.9 shot-per-second continuous mode (with AF servo!), low light mode (with ISO's up to 12,800(!!)), scene mode with countless scene choices (including HDR which does remarkably well), and of course HD video mode.  Let me mention one thing about the HD video however.  It's not that great, in my opinion.  I also have the Canon SD940IS, and it takes beautiful HD video.  This camera does not.  There is a lot of \"judder\" when filming moving objects, or when panning the camera.  It's not smooth at all when moving.  The 940 is very smooth, even when walking and filming.  The s95 struggles to maintain a clear video, unless filming stationary objects.  Not good if you intend on making videos of your children running or playing!  I think it has something to do with the type of sensors in each camera.  I don't know anything about this technical stuff, but it appears this camera's sensor is more geared for still photographs and not HD video.  However, there are two mics on the front of the camera, for STEREO sound!If you are buying this solely for the HD video, you may want to look elsewhere (you can get HD video in products much cheaper than this now).  Still, the video is probably passable to most, and should not be a hinderance from buying this great little package!EDIT:  When I first wrote the review, I did not know why the HD video was subpar to the smaller, cheaper SD940IS.  The reason is that the s95 only shoots 24 frams per second of video (FPS), whereas the 940 shoots 30 FPS.  The s95's video is clealy choppy, but you can change the video settings to shoot 30 FPS (but will not be true HD).", "Date": "September 24, 2010"}, {"Title": "Good camera.

I really love the size of the camera and the fact it is pocket-able.  It can take pics on the same level as the G11.  I do miss the hot shoe but not the size of the G11.  I do have more misfires than the G11, and certainly more than the T2i.  However, I am disappointed in the video.  I bought the S95 for the HD video.  The G11 takes great video (albeit Standard Definition).  The S90 takes okay video but noticeably inferior to the video I've taken with my G11 (even if they are supposed to have the same sensor, there's a definite difference).  In fact, I think I liked the video from my old SD1200 better than the S90's.  The S95 while 720p, is vastly inferior in quality to the T2i (@ 720p) and really doesn't look much better than the G11's Standard Def.  Yeah, it's 720p, but it looks much more grainy and seems to lack clarity, even in outdoor and well lit video.  I wasn't expecting video on par with the T2i (at 1080p or 720p) but I certainly expected more than I got.  The lack of auto-focus and optical zoom with video is an annoyance.  And while I consider video a secondary feature, I would still like it to be good.  The upgrades over the S90 aren't anything great. It's not a bad camera (it's quite good) but I don't think it's worth the premium over the S90 for the few extra features you get.And another gripe is Adobe Lightroom 3.2 does not yet support S95 RAW files.  Not a knock against the camera or Canon, I understand Adobe works in cycles to add cameras.  Though I do wonder why the 60D already is compatible while the S95 is out and is not.  It's still something it's target buyer should be aware of (I wasn't until I tried to import the RAW files).Edited on 9/22/10 - One feature that I really like about the S95 that I didn't think about until using an S90 again was the ability to set a Maximum Auto ISO.

I'm not a pro photographer by any means, more of a novice, but the great thing about this camera is that it actually helps one learn about photography. Adjusting settings like the f stop, iso, and shutter speed are reflected in real time on the LCD screen so you're seeing what each setting does.One of the reasons I bought this camera was to take photos that allow for blurring of the background, focusing on the subject in the foreground. This may seem trivial, but this feat is extremely difficult with cheaper point and shoots that don't have an aperture priority mode. I moved up from a new Nikon S8100, a good but not great camera. While there are many modes with my Nikon and it's got more megapixels, the images taken with my S95 are better because of the larger, better sensor.The adjusting ring located around the lens is very easy to use. You can adjust it to control various settings. Mine is set to focus. When adjusting the focus, the camera conveniently displays a mini screen within the LCD screen that shows what you are focusing on.For a lot of people, it's down to this camera and the Panasonic LX5 or the Nikon P700. I'm not familiar with the P700 but I have done some research on the LX5. The sensor is larger on the LX5 and it's got a wider angle lens. I have seen pics taken with both in a Cameralabs review and the LX5 seems to take clearer pictures during the day, but the S95 does just a tad better with more natural looking artifacts at higher isos. In terms of the physical body, the S95 is sleeker and doesn't require a lens cap. The S95 lacks, however, a hot shoe for attachments/accessories. But smaller isn't always better. The S95 can be a bit hard to keep in your hands when adjusting the center control ring, even with my medium sized hands. The battery in the LX5 lasts longer and the LX5 has a dedicated button for shooting video. One thing I was disappointed with was the fact one cannot adjust the focus in video shooting mode. This would have made a great bonus.So the bottom line when choosing between the two cameras comes down to price and availability. Both cameras are awesome, with the S95 cheaper but harder to find in stock in many stores.

I was breaking the SLR habit as I needed to travel light and it is genuinely liberating not to have a SLR around your neck.  You can carry the S95 and two extra batteries in a single pocket.A quick review of the 2400 plus photos I came back with in Picassa on the iMac 27 shows great color rendition,  excellent contrast and great sharpness.  I'm not at all regretting the decision to bring only the S95.  I was also looking at the LX-5 as the 24mm Leica lens was very attractive to me.  However the additional size would be an issue and there seems to be some concern about the JPEG color rendition.  I have no interest in a great deal of post processing so JPEG rendition is very important to me.  This is the fourth small Canon I've had.  I've only had a problem with one, a is870 that developed a gray spot on the LCD.  I bought and would recommend a screen protector for the LCD in an abundance of caution even though I'm not generally a screen saver kind of guy.Some random thoughts:  The camera is pretty sturdy (at times it reminded me of my old Nikon F3 for reasons not entirely clear to me) and the black finish is tough and plenty grippy,  LCD screen is excellent and is visible even in bright light.  Full auto mode is hard to beat.  Other modes are useful for specific situations.  The other mode I used most often is low light.  However you should set up the buttons so that with one push you can set WB to the scene as the auto mode in low light is not always accurate.  The problem with the low light mode is that it jacks the ISO up quite a bit.  However it can capture photos in extremely low light conditions that even my SLR could not take.  There are sometimes focus issues in low light mode but it easily goes into manual focus.  The pixilation at ISO's up to 800 is not bad.You can set up different modes to access immediately key settings.  For example you can set up Tv to shoot vivid or slide film color mode and then use auto or another mode to shoot normal color.  You can also shoot in different aspect ratios.  There are many different modes, some of which are useful.  The external ring is best used to set focal length in my experience.  The rotating ring on the back is most often used for exposure variation unless you are shooting in full manual mode.The battery life is not impressive although I admit that I have no idea of how many photos per battery I was getting.  However having three batteries was mandatory for a full days' shooting - although you'll have to recharge more before you go out at night.  The size of the camera is a blessing and a curse.  The small size makes panning smoothly in video mode difficult and getting photos level even with the grid in place sometimes difficult.I have to say that while there are minor nits they are far outweighed by the enormous capabilities of this camera.

I'm sure this was stated in the CD manual (which is annoying, bc I'd much rather have a printed booklet), but I'm a guy and I don't like to read instruction manuals.Also, the fisheye effect will never get old for me. I can entertain myself for hours looking through photos of friends and family in fisheye mode. You actually get 3 different levels of fisheye effects to choose from (from not so fishy to very fishy). The miniature mode is cool, too.One of the more annoying things about the S95 (as some other reviewers have already mentioned), is how the time-lapse video mode can only be done with the miniature effect.

I have an appreciation for photography and have a little knowledge in it. Also, I believe when it comes down to what is the best camera for you it takes experimenting a lot, and personal preference especially since both the LX5 and the S95 seem to be above and beyond others. I travel a good deal and want great photos. Having said that, after using the Canon S95 for a while I wasn't completely satisfied with the images overall. I used it in various lighting and conditions. They seemed to have a softness, albeit slight, that I couldn't get past. I shot with two different S95s and both produced the same results. My original S90 didnt have this issue. I don't know why. I used it the same way. This is simply what I experienced. While I had my S95 I had also been looking at reviews and specs for the Panasonic Lumix LX5. I took the plunge and returned the Canon recently and bought the Lumix. Ive never owned a Panasonic before. I'm even more impressed with the LX5. There was a noticeable difference in the image sharpness on Program mode, shadows seemed better and focus was crisp. For me, it feels more secure in my hand, the image quality is really exceptional( I think better than the S95 although I have not tried as many low light shots), and the color is rich but also can be natural. Also some the \"My Color Mode\" options are super! The lens is faster as well. It is a bit bigger than the S95 but for me I don't really \"pocket\" my camera most of the time anyways so it wasn't a deterrent. I usually have it in a belt pouch or in a bag. The Canon S95 is more pocketable and still produces images waaaaaay better than most out there, especially low light,  but I will be keeping the LX5 because so far, and I have not tried every function yet, it has won me over completely.", "Date": "October 19, 2010"}, {"Title": "A great successor to the S90", "Author": "Jason Phillips \"Jason Phillips\"", "ReviewID": "RXLINNQ5ZGH0V", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "What a great camera and a great experience from the first photo you snap.

Especially the low-light performance is excellent. I was out taking pictures of my back yard at dusk, with no tripod and no flash, and with a +2/3 exposure compensation, it looked almost like daylight. I tried the same shot with my SD700IS (and another subcompact I was auditioning, with a smaller sensor and aperture) and neither came close to the amount of detail and clarity I got from the S95.  Since I don't like using flash unless it's absolutely necessary, there are a lot of times when performance under limited lighting conditions is important.I have many of the same gripes that others have mentioned in this forum, but most of them feel pretty minor to me. I've gotten used to holding it so my finger doesn't get in the way of the flash. And I'm already used to no auto-focus or optical zoom during movies, since the SD700IS did neither of those either.  Sure, I would prefer that it did those things, but I don't strictly *need* it to.  As far as I can tell after many hours of research (and auditioning a few candidates), this is the best subcompact camera you can buy at any price.  (I've read reviews of the Panasonic DMC-LX5, which sounds great; but it's not in the same size class, and is just too big for me to consider.)But my one serious gripe is a pretty big one: its lack of responsiveness to user input. For example, say you want to toggle the flash between Auto and Off, which I seem to do frequently (since this camera, like most others, often seems to want to flash under inappropriate circumstances). You push a key to bring up the menu, and then another key to cycle through the choices, and when you pause for a second or two, it accepts the setting you have stopped on. On my SD700IS, each key press was handled instantly, so once you're familiar with it, you could do it very quickly, and almost without looking. On the S95, it slides the menu into view, and this takes, I dunno, maybe 3/4 second. (It seems like an eternity, but I haven't measured it, this is just a guess.) And here's the kicker: IT DROPS ANY BUTTON PRESSES WHICH OCCUR WHILE IT'S ANIMATING THE MENU. So not only is it slower to operate, but also I have to pay more attention to it, so I can notice when it is ready to accept my next button press. What the heck?!I find this particularly disappointing, since it's a regression compared to a 4+ year-old camera from the same manufacturer. I find this particularly frustrating, because it seems like an arbitrary design choice they made, rather than some inherent limitation of the hardware (like, say, auto-focus speed). And I find it particularly surprising, since the S95 seems targetted at more sophisticated users, who are more likely to frown on fluffy menu animations, and just want something that works quickly with no fuss. I'm sure somebody thought this would look slick, and maybe it does to some. Who knows, maybe it even helps usability for some inexperienced users (though I doubt it). But THERE IS NO WAY TO TURN IT OFF. I have skimmed the entire manual, and walked all the config screens looking for it, but no dice. Even if the setting was buried deep in their config menus, that would have been enough for me. I'd only have to find it once.The other thing is that it pops up or retracts the flash as you cycle over the options, and this again causes a brief delay before you can move on to the next item. Besides making it slower, if you skip over your desired selection by accident, it may end up having to move the flash again, which causes more delay, and I don't like the idea of extra wear and tear on the mechanism. I suppose some usability guy thought it was better feedback to move the flash immediately, but I think this is too high of a price to pay, and seeing the highlight move between the selections on the LCD screen is perfectly adequate feedback.Some may pooh-pooh the importance of these seemingly short delays. I'm probably going to live for 77.6 years, so what's 3/4 second now and then? But anyone with kids or pets knows that every microsecond is crucial when you're trying to capture a moment. We have 15 cute chickens in the back yard, and they do not stop to pose for shots! Sure, you could say (and some have) that if I need super-quick responses, I should get a DSLR. But I must have a subcompact regardless, to take on trips, and I don't really want to spend an extra $500+ to own a DSLR on top of this. And besides this menu thing, I think the S95 is adequately responsive -- I've lived with the SD700IS for a few years, and have gotten used to it. The S95 is annoyingly close to being the perfect camera (for me).One last (unrelated) thing: I'm not sure why the auto-ISO selects such a high value sometimes. Recently it selected a high-enough ISO for there to be some quality degradation (I forget what it was, maybe 640 or something), and the exposure speed was 1/320th of a second, or something really quick. I'm no photography expert, and I may just be exposing my ignorance here -- but couldn't it have selected a lower ISO, with an exposure that was correspondingly slower, but still fast enough to avoid blurring from camera shake? Yes, there is a setting for this exact thing: how quickly it kicks up the auto-ISO. I tried changing it from \"normal\" to \"low\", and it did better in some cases; but in other cases, it didn't kick it up enough, and it selected an ISO so low that it needed an exposure so slow that it gave me the camera shake warning. So neither \"low\" nor \"normal\" is good for all circumstances. Why can't it just start with an exposure quick enough to not worry about shaking, and then choose whatever ISO is appropriate for that? (at least within some reasonable range of circumstances)  Yes, of course you can set the ISO manually, or use shutter speed priorty, and I have started doing just that -- but often I don't have time to fiddle with those settings, and it seems like its auto mode could be smarter about this stuff.I'm keeping it anyway, since (as long as you pay attention to the settings it's choosing, and sometimes override them) nothing else can touch it for image quality + compactness, and I generally like the Canon interface (other than the particular design blunder I've been ranting about). But I really really hope that Canon decides to fix the menu animations in a firmware update or something. And by fixing it, I mean adding an option to turn off the animations, or scrapping them altogether.", "Date": "December 6, 2010"}, {"Title": "Excellent Point & Shoot - Leave the SLR at home", "Author": "Michael Behnken \"mike\"", "ReviewID": "R1BNF9UJLIEIL7", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I rate the S95 4.5 stars so I will round up and give it a 5.

I take them around to random events at my university and on vacations, and the pictures from this camera, given decent lighting, rival those of my DSLR. The best parts? Not only is it so simple to use that my parents can use it, but it also has the robustness of controls of a manual camera, and it fits in my front jeans pocket. There are a number of things that make this camera far better than most other point and shoots--especially any point and shoot that is this size or smaller.First, the image quality in well lit situations is fantastic.  The sensor in the camera is far larger than most point and shoots, which leads to very good image quality. In general, there is very little noise and pixelation in images even at relatively high ISOs, and colors are represented very well.  In terms of raw image quality, I don't think there's a camera of the S95's size that rivals it.Second, the camera can open up it's aperature very large. I find this to be extremely useful as I think that flash--especially those on point and shoots--makes pictures look bad a lot.  One of the most common ways to make a picture look bad is if it's blurry, but that's not an issue for this camera, because the aperature can just open wide. It also allows me to take pictures with this camera that have a very shallow depth of field--a functionality I used to reserve for my DSLR.Third, the manual controls are pretty great. I really like how the ring around the actual lens is a control, mimicking a classic aperature ring.  This allows for natural manual use of the camera, and so I use it all the time for that purpose. The camera shoots to RAW as well, which is great.Finally, a bunch of random things.  The build quality feels good--no unstable parts, mostly metal casing.  Battery life is quite long, though I do have an extra battery just in case. And the screen and software on the camera itself are pretty good--not much of a pain to browse through a ton of pictures on a long vacation, since you can do things like organize pictures by date and jump 10 or 100 pictures at a time. And it's very simple to use, so even my parents are proficient at using it.In short, I love this camera, and it's by far the best point and shoot I have ever found. The only downside I can say is that it doesn't zoom very far--but if you get a camera that zooms farther, you will invariably be making a considerable tradeoff with image quality, and when zoomed in you'll probably take blurry pictures anyway (the more you zoom in, the more your hand shaking can affect a picture), so I don't see it as much of a downside.

Who knew the S95 would beat the LX-5 to owner's hands?After seeing the release on DPReview on the 19th, I investigated the camera further.  I though, wow it looks very similar to my S90.  I compared stats and saw that it was fractionally slimmer and the power and ring function buttons had swapped placement.  The most exciting thing I found on the S95...  I could actually use a neck strap with it!  I found holes on both sides, now I just have to find one that'll fit (Come on Canon, you couldn't put one in the box!).Well, my S95 arrived today and I was excited because I still had my S90 before I dropped it off at the post office to meet it's new owner.  I was happy to compare them side-by-side in person.In person, you'll notice the finish compared to the S90.  That camera feels like a bar of soap in the shower now compared to the S95.

The S95 is being replaced by the S100, but it was not available yet, and I needed to get it before xmas. I have no regrets, the S95 does everything I need, for less. The S100 upgrades you from 720p to 1080p video and you get 2 more MP. We shot videos on this and displayed it on a 50 inch 1080p flatscreen and they looked awesome. Good enough for me.

I no longer have any desire to get a micro 4/3rds- I am confident this camera can take great pics in a lot of situations and to get better than this, I'll just buy last year's DSLR offering.PROS:1. Pics look awesome. Seriously. We snapped pics at the Golden Gate bridge at DUSK alongside our friend with a Canon DSLR with a decent lens and the pics look shockingly comparable.

I'm not a mindless drone, but I'm also not sitting for hours waiting to get the lighting just right. Seriously, just point the sucker and click.2. We always have it with us, because it's small! We've taken hundreds of photos and have yet to have a single red-eye. Even when the flash does come on. But on auto, the flash rarely comes on and pics still have tons of light.3. Battery life is not awesome, but we managed to take a hundred or so pics over an entire day on vacation. Good enough for me. Amazon sells a no-name battery that costs as much as a latte and has good reviews.4. It is small enough to put it in the back pocket of my jeans, but it's a pretty tight fit- would not fit in a woman's jean pocket. But it fits easily in a coat pocket or a clutch.5.

It can shoot RAW, etc. But honestly, we haven't messed with it yet (only had it for a month) because you can just switch it to auto and it takes awesome pics without any composition or thought on your part.CONS:1. The pop-up flash. Annoying, took me a bit to get used to. Now I hold in such a way that when the flash DOES pop up, my finger is not in the way. But I'm afraid when we give it to a friend to take a pic of us, it's gonna pop up and scare them and they'll drop the camera.

Some noise is to be expected here, but it is ATROCIOUS at ISO 1600 or above. Without serious post-processing, indoor non-flash photos are pretty unusable. If you stick to the wide end of the lens you can avoid this, but even at 50mm equivalent you're already limited to to f/3.2 and the long end is f/4.9.

Sometimes it was inconvenient to carry the SLR and I was missing potentially great images that I would happen upon just during everyday life. A solution would be a pocket \"carry around\" camera and a month ago I started looking around for one.After 4 weeks of research and reading copious reviews the Canon S95 emerged as the best because it had the most features that I desired and looked to be the best value for the money. Here is my summary:Pros:- Amazing image quality- Easy to learn controls (especially if you have other Canon cameras)- Solid construction (metal, not plastic - wow!)- Fits nicely into my shirt pocket (important for me)- An astonishing range of capabilities- Great low light performance- Wheel and ring work wonderfully to change settingsCons: (these are very minor)- Price! (I paid 399.99 I now see it is down to 388.83 but you are getting a lot for your money)- The pop up flash has caught me a few times even though I knew of this issue before I bought the camera (Old habits of holding cameras this size die hard)- OK, I admit I am old school - I like a printed operations manual that I can carry with me. Canon (probably to save money) provides the manual on a CD with this camera. The S95 does so many things I need the manual to reference when I need it during this learning curve. So only getting the manual on a CD is a negative to me (Are you listening Canon? If you can't provide it with the camera maybe you could sell the printed manual as an extra? I would buy one!).Overall I am extremely pleased with this camera.  It has fit the \"bill\" perfectly for what I wanted and I would recommend it to anyone who has a DSLR but is looking for a \"carry around\" camera or even to those who do not. It would be a great \"step up\" for those moving toward the DSLR world.Buy it, you won't be disappointed.", "Date": "November 12, 2010"}, {"Title": "Great camera", "Author": "Joel Cleare", "ReviewID": "RMS2ZEFBGBFSF", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I needed an excellent point and shoot to complement my canon 60d dslr.

There is no camera with the control and quality of a medium format technical camera, the versatility, handling, low light performance and responsiveness of a DSLR, and with the ease of use,  size and cost of a point and shoot.  So the name of the game is compromise.  You will have to sacrifice some less important features to get the ones that are important to you.I already have a nice DSLR, but have found it has one big drawback.  It is too big and heavy, and too conspicuous to have on me all the time.  So I miss shots because it is at home.  To fill that gap, I wanted a small (truly pocketable) camera, with good quality, decent low light performance, and most of the control that my DSLR gives me.  The S95 perfectly fills that gap.Pros:- small and light (easily slips in a trouser or shirt pocket)- excellent picture quality in most circumstances- decent low light performer, helped by image stabilisation and an f/2.0 lens (though only at wide angle)- shoots RAW, and has all the controls I need (PASM modes, plus the usual scene modes)- clever controls, such as the dial around the lens make up for a shortage of dedicated buttons- good 720p HD videoCons:- small (so hard to hold well)- short battery life- no focusing and only digital zoom during video- no viewfinder (which would help better framing)- not as fast or responsive as a DSLR (obviously)Competitors like the G12 (which has the same sensor), P7000 and LX5 reduce these drawbacks.  But they're bigger, and would be at home much more often.  Which is why the S95 is the best compromise for me.

The flash is not a pop-up but actually a motorized pop-up. What that means is that a button controls when the flash comes out of the body and even when it goes in by a button or menu. So the flash is motorized and not a trigger/spring loaded mechanism. This is bad because I tend to hold the camera with a finger on the top left surface where the flash is supposed to pop-up. And when the flash does pop-up, it does it by actuating a motor which bzzz's the flash to come outside and many times my finger comes in the way which may eventually break the pop-up flash mechanism of this camera.Whats even worse is that the flash will not go in by pressing the flash into the body. It will go in when you turn the camera off or through some menu buttons. So dont give your camera to a stranger who will take your picture and try to push back the flash by force.

But, there are times when I wish I could get closer with the zoom and I can not. If the camera is asked to move the lens in any way (other than to turn on or off), It will give an error message and it will shut off. The camera does work when I turn it back on, but I really don't know how long I have before my beloved camera will never turn on again.Now you can use this information to make an informed decision.

For more serious scenic stuff I am using the AV Mode with the lowest possible ISO.Don't be put off by the 10 Megapixels. Ten is plenty, and the 12, 14, 16 are probably interpolated up, anyway.I gave the S95 five stars because it does well what a camera does. While I generally dislike the over-miniaturization that seems to plague the industry, I bought the S95 especially for it's small size. I knew I could have gotten the same sensor and lens with a G-series camera. I can't pick the S95 up without tripping the Playback button, but a Franiec or Flpback stick-on grip will help you get a good hold on it. Also, use the wrist cord. It's all too easy to drop this little guy.All controls are intuitive, and the S-button and outer ring can be customized to your liking. Be sure to turn OFF Image Stabilization when placing the camera on a flat surface for self-timer shots. If you forget to do this, you'll have a reason for blurry shots.

I found myself using it primarily at home for food photography for my blog, but very little outside of that.Because of that, I wanted a smaller camera that would fit in my pocket, but would still have very good photo quality and would allow me to shoot with a high level of control over my settings, much as I do with my DSLR.  However, I still wanted it to be able to take good pictures in auto mode for those times when I'm too lazy to adjust for my shot or want to hand my camera to someone else.Initially I was deciding between getting a point and shoot or getting a micro four thirds camera like the Olympus PEN E-PL1 12.3MP Live MOS Micro Four Thirds Interchangeable Lens Digital Camera with 14-42mm f/3.5-5.6 Zuiko Digital Zoom Lens (Black), which is at a similar price point.  Originally I had been strongly considering the E-PL1 because I liked that with an adapter I could use my existing Olympus lenses on this camera, but dislike that in order to get one in a similar price range as a higher end point and shoot that I would have to buy the flash separately.Eventually after reading many reviews on Amazon and consumer electronics sites I decided on this camera and am very happy I did.  For a point and shoot the picture quality is very good and I am often happy with the results even when shooting in automatic mode. For example, I've been getting some great shots of my dog, which isn't easy since he's black so there isn't a tremendous amount of contrast.  I've also gotten some really great photos in low light settings.  Recently I took pictures in some caves while on vacation and when comparing the photos of this camera to those of my friends there was a noticeable difference.The zoom is perfect for my needs and the quality of the pictures has been good.  I'm also really enjoying the interface of the camera.  It is very easy and I find it quite easy to adjust my shutter speed and aperture.  The size is also great.  It is certainly not as small as some of the other digital cameras on the market, but MUCH better than a DSLR.  I have no problem tucking it into a pocket or putting it in my purse which has been great.  I'm now taking it out much more often and getting a lot more candids.There are only a couple of things I don't care for with this camera.  The first is the absence of a viewfinder.  Having the screen in the back is fine, but sometimes can be a bit delayed and is a bit challenging to get used to after shooting with a viewfinder for so long.  I really wish that this camera had a viewfinder as well even if it made it slightly larger.  I'm also not a huge fan of the styling of the camera.  Yes, this is subjective and has no bearing on the quality of the camera, but it does look a bit dated and inexpensive even though in reality it is a great point and shoot.Overall, I'm very happy with it.  Granted it's been a month at this point so I'm curious to see how it will hold up over time and how I'll like it as I continue to use it more and more, but after having it for a month I'm quite satisfied so far.", "Date": "June 9, 2011"}, {"Title": "HD video works well for a P&S;", "Author": "DH", "ReviewID": "R27O60A9BYTXQ1", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I've had the camera for a month or so and purchased it to be a point & shoot with extra controls like my dSLR.

I didn't have huge hopes for that aspect of it as I'm used to my Canon S11 camcorder which has been great but the S95 actually doesn't do too bad.  The pictures are crisp and clear and more surprisingly, the sound quality is good too.  I've been at a few concerts where video equipment wasn't allowed (oops) and brought the S95 in in my pocket and I've taken video of songs that, watching them later on my computer, came out sounding really well with reasonable bass reproduction that I'm not used to hearing result from a little point & shoot camera microphone.", "Date": "June 3, 2011"}, {"Title": "Best point-and-shoot... hands down!", "Author": "Sophia Kontaridis", "ReviewID": "RE92AXXOOF1MY", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I bought the S95 as a replacement for an Olympus Tough camera.

The S95 was reviewed very positively, and after having used it for 5 months, I can say that it's even better than what I expected.First, it was much smaller than I thought it would be. Reading the dimensions is one thing, but when you actually are able to hold this camera, you can truly appreciate how portable it really is, about the size of a pack of cigarettes would be about right. It is very, very solid, you can tell that it was built to last and the finish is very understated, which is what I prefer. One thing about the size though, if you have large hands, it may be challenging to grip the camera comfortably each time, especially when you are trying to do it quickly.The picture quality is I think outstanding. I'm sure the pictures would look even better if I knew how to properly take pictures, but using the P mode, the images look natural and great pretty much every time. Despite being on the lower side in terms of megapixels, the images have a good amount of detail, and with the fast lens, low light pictures have significantly better results. There is also aperture and shutter priority modes, so you can experiment, or even use full manual. The lens is very flush to the body, and will jut out when the camera is on and ready to take pictures.

I don't notice noise creeping into the photos until about ISO 800, but it's there. However, for a $400 p/s camera, it doesn't merit comparison to a proper SLR.Getting used to the ring control wasn't that bad - it was just new for me to have to use my left hand to take photos with a p/s camera. If you've used a Canon before, there's virtually zero learning curve. The surface has been changed from the S90, which didn't lend itself to making you feel like you have a solid grip on the camera. This feels solid and won't slip out of your hands.There are a few downsides worth mentioning. In-camera HDR isn't too bad, but for some reason (maybe this is just me) but it chooses high ISO photos to use for processing and thus, you've got noisy HDR photos. In well-lighted conditions, it's great and a nice little gimmick.Also, the downside of the camera shooting RAW is that you have to wait until RAW codecs are available for both OS X, Windows and third party processing applications. I'm a slave to Lightroom, and I'm waiting for that to be updated.

I loved the first 3 models, and their early demises were all my fault (dropped 2 in water, and had a 3rd one stolen from my checked luggage en route to Costa Rica...lesson learned). I loved the high quality and reliability of the pictures, and the small size made for an ideal vacation camera. I was more likely to take the PowerShot everywhere I went which meant more opportunities for great pictures, as opposed to lugging around a larger, more advanced model that I couldn't slide in my pocket.However, the sx210is (the 14x optical zoom was the big selling point for me) was my first big disappointment - it had a very long shutter lag, and its auto-focus repeatedly failed to deliver. I missed countless shots during a trip to South America because either the camera took too long to fire after pressing the button, or the picture would be severely blurred because the camera would fire before the auto-focus was able to finish its job. It was a huge step backwards in reliability and quality from the earlier models.I recently purchased the s95 to replace the disappointing sx210. After working fine for 3 weeks, it started \"freaking out\". Newly charged batteries would drain very fast (within an hour) even while the camera was powered off. The flash seemed to be at the core of the issues - it ceased to extract itself when needed (yes, the flash setting was on \"auto\"). Furthermore, the camera would completely freeze/ lock-up when the flash eventually did pop-up. I couldn't even turn-off the camera, as the On/Off button was unresponsive - I had to wait for it to power-down on its own, after the which the problem above persisted if the flash was involved. Finally, an error message stating \"flash in incorrect position, restart camera\" would occasionally pop-up, even when the flash was in the closed position.Needless to say, I've placed a warranty call to Canon and am sending the camera in for warranty service.

I also took my Canon DSLR on the trip. After seeing the ease of use, image quality, and benefits of a compact, I took a total of 2 pics with the DSLR and over 800 with the s95. The camera is unbelievable. With a few minor in camera setting 'tweaks' I had better contrast, more vivid colors and more convenience than lugging around my cumbersome DSLR. the $400 was a bit much to swallow at first, but once I saw how well the camera works and the quality of construction I see the $400 as a bargain compared to $1500+ for a new DSLR. As far as the way I shoot travel pics I like to be ambiguous and a bit stealth, and my DSLR just doesn't let me shoot that way. I truly enjoyed my trip much more by being able to slip it into my pocket, snap a great perfectly exposed shot and then move on. No bulky straps, extra lenses, or giant tourist flag hanging around my neck. Awesome, awesome camera.

Mulcahy", "ReviewID": "R14S0KRKU94C1B", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "The Canon S95 takes stunning pictures that are way beyond my expectations, just like most other owners have reported.  In the basic mode I use, I simply can't believe how good the picture look.  I take a lot of landscapes, gardens, street scenes and detail closeups and am strictly amateur.I could gush all day, but people are probably more interested in the few flaws I can perceive at my non-professional level. First is the instructions, which are only available on a disk.  This camera is fortunately fairly intuitive but to use any of the higher features you need to be reading the manual which I'm not willing to print out and lug everywhere.  I also don't like that they use vocabulary appropriate for professional/advanced photographers, who wouldn't need to use the manual much anyway.  Ultimately, I may or may not advance beyond the basic level.The camera tends to make things very colorful, which I happen to like, but when adjusting the pics (very few need adjusting compared with my old old Olympus digital) I once in a while have to turn the color saturation down.  I'd rather have it be this way than have the pics come out too drab.  I'm amazed at the quality of pics I can get outdoors in the middle of the day under blazing sun.Speaking of adjusting pics, I am very pleased with the Digital Photo Professional editing program that comes with the camera.  You can resize, tilt, adjust all aspects of color, hue, contrast, sharpness, etc.  I'm not interested in the complications of Photo Shop and there's really no need.  In fact, I frequently find after diddling with the adjustments I prefer the shot exactly as the camera took it.  Probably the most common adjustment I make after re-sizing and cropping is to up the contrast on overcast outdoor shots a small tick or two.One reason I chose this model is because you can set it to focus manually.  I thought I needed this because my old camera took so many out-of-focus shots and there was no manual focus.  The S95 is so good with focus, I never even bother with the manual focus.  The viewfinder shows you what the camera is focusing on, and if that's not what you want, you just half-depress the shutter button again for a different focus option.  Very cool.  Even in non-macro mode, and without a tripod, I get very close up shots of flowers that are startling in their clear detail when blown up.Some have said the camera body is slippery or flimsy.  I think it feels very substantial for something so small, and the grip feels quite secure.  Of course, you need to get used to how to hold it.Others have rightly said that a LCD viewfinder is impossible to use outdoors on a very bright day.  I did get used to not looking through a real viewfinder pretty quickly, but the LCD screen on this camera requires an act of faith when shooting on a bright sunny day.  Have to say that usually the faith is rewarded.  I can't say much that's helpful about indoor shots, because I don't take many, but when I do they look fine.  Outdoor shots at twilight are very beautiful.  I don't use the video mode.For my last nit-pick, I signed up for the Emails to customers, and have been pretty disappointed.  I was hoping for good tips and info about using the camera better.  Instead, it's just routine marketing.  Well, maybe with a camera this good they can coast on the non-essential stuff.

I like that it feels like it is made well. I like the quality of some of the photos I've gotten.

It is not so easy to hold the camera where I would normally hold it. If the picture quality hadn't been as nice, I'd have returned it for that issue.Because I am such a novice, I am unable to correct the temperature of the pictures. It seems the pictures all come out with a warmer tone (a slight yellowish cast) than I like. I actually prefer cooler tones on most things. But the option of warm/cool tones is not on this camera or I can't find it. Besides the flash, that is the biggest draw back for me, because I have to color correct every picture and that is time consuming.But, I am quite pleased with the detail I've gotten on around half the pictures.

The Aperture-Priority (Av) and Shutter-Priority (Tv) and two control dials let me get the look I want in my pictures, not the prescribed program that most compacts require, without wading through dozens of menus. Nice job, Canon.The biggest downside is that the autofocus can be a bit erratic. The camera doesn't always accurately focus on the subject and switching to manual focus mode can be a pain because I need to fiddle around with the four-way controller to turn it on, and then the function of the control rings changes.

I have to say that I had little expectations for a pocket camera. After all, the P&S; category, generally, leaves a lot to be desired. This one, literally, blew my mind. Out of 80 shots that I brought home, 75 were keepers. Keep in mind, I used the camera at night, hand-held, at 30 degree outside temperature, no flash...I am sure, if you did the pixel level analysis, you would be able to come up with some flaws. I am sure that if you compared it to a real dSLR, with an L-quality lens, you would be able to find some flaws.

Seriously, not many cameras can do that. And P&S;? I do not think you can get any to perform...Movies? Awesome quality. My only gripe is that they are not in MOV format (from AVI that my sd500 used to do), and Microsoft Movie Maker does not handle these... But then again, for good compression ratio and for 720p, I am willing to forego some of the editing capabilities. As for the ability to focus while shooting the movie - the camera's depth of field handles it fine under most occasions.

The only bad thing is when you need to ues the flash that when it comes up it almost always hits your finger. You do get used to it and learn to move your finger before it comes up.

Veronica \"superstar\"", "ReviewID": "R4QIK88U5N2PT", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I am totally smitten by this camera. It's very portable and takes great shots. I used to rely on my Nikon D90 12.3MP DX-Format CMOS Digital SLR Camera with 18-105mm f/3.5-5.6G ED AF-S VR DX Nikkor Zoom Lens to get the best possible shots but I don't have to lug that thing around anymore. I'm an amateur photographer but I have taken a few classes so I think I have a pretty good idea of what a \"good\" picture looks like and until now I would have said you could not get one from an ultra-compact. Boy have I had to change my tune.I love all the manual controls and the control ring on the front of the camera. This camera is also very easy to customize to make it work best for you. You have the ability to choose what the control ring on the front of the camera does and there is a custom setting you can set on the dial ring on the top of the camera to remember your favorite camera settings. There is also shutter priority and aperture priority mode, low light mode and manual exposure mode. The camera has manual or automatic focus and many different scene modes.There are also some fun features on this camera for the hobbyist or artistic photographer. I've been have a great time with the fisheye and miniature effects, which can also be used in video. The fisheye is pretty self explanatory for what it does and the miniature gives you a tilt-shift look to your pictures in camera. It's almost like getting a set of Lensbaby The Composer for Canon EF mount Digital SLR Cameraslenses for your camera thrown in for free, which is great because this camera would not be able to accept the mount anyway.I would suggest buying a few accessories for this camera, all of which I have outfitted my setup with. First an lcd protector, I bought the GGS Glass LCD Screen Protector for Canon PowerShot S95 and it fits perfectly. You can purchase the GGS Optical Glass LCD Screen Protector 3\" for Digital Cameras for cheaper but it is a smidge smaller than the lcd on the camera. I also bought the Deluxe Leather Case PSC-3200 (for SX210IS, also compatible for S90) because it fits my camera with the custom grip from Richard Franiec attached (which can be purchased at lensmate .com). I also bought the custom lens adapter from lensmate so that I can use filters with this camera which opens up even more opportunities for creativity. I would also suggest buying another wrist strap as the one that comes with the camera is a little too long for my comfort, I'm afraid it will slip off. I'm still searching for the perfect wrist strap though, if you have any suggestions I'd love to hear them.I believe that you can take great pictures with any camera because you can fix quite a bit in post processing these day, but I also don't want to give up the ability to manually control the cameras settings in order to have a small camera. With the canon s95 I get the best of both worlds, I'm able to manually configure the camera in all the ways that please me AND I can fit it in my pocket. Oh, and did I mention that this camera shoots RAW? Awesome!While there is no one camera that is perfect for everyone I think this is close to my perfect camera. Sometimes I wish it had more optical zoom but other than that I really have no complaints. Besides, you really should move closer to your subject if you want to get a great pic rather than zooming in. This camera is also great for street photography because it is easily palmed if you want to take some stealth shots. You can set your camera to your custom settings and just shoot away!So what are you waiting for, if you're reading this review you are considering this camera. Stop. Go buy it. You'll love it just like I do.", "Date": "July 29, 2011"}, {"Title": "The only compact camera for actually taking photos", "Author": "~D \"wiredrabbit\"", "ReviewID": "R1R0CI1GO372CW", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I have had Sony, Canon and Panasonic compacts and did find the Sony to be good at times, but fell down in some situations, the Canons were always good and except for low light performance, I think I might consider the smaller sensor Canons.  Panasonics have great features and if photographic quality isn't an issue, they are great, some of the larger format Panasonics can compete, but nothing comes close in a compact.  Having had these and recently purchased this, I find it an excellent camera and great value.There is nothing that is close in this size.  I am able to make the other cameras work, but I can easily get amazing results from this. I can push the background back to bring up the subject.  The lens has a nice boke, which is utterly amazing in a compact P&S.;  And the quality is generally excellent.  I have seen some less than perfect shots, but I come back feeling the camera will help me correct any mistakes.  It won't compete with a DSLR, but it is so nice and small.I considered the G12, but really went for the easy carry compact size feeling that the G12 offered more, but not much I needed.  If I really need more, than I'll get the big gun (the inexpensive lens for which cost more than this). This is in my pocket.  Always. It still turns out great quality.I don't want to see Canon turn this into some sort of super zoom - or movie maker (unless they can keep the size the same with a bigger sensor)  I don't want GPS or any idiot modes.  The pop up flash is odd, but doesn't really affect much.  I haven't noticed battery life issues yet.  I have seen some blow out and odd focus choices, and I find the menus a bit challenging.  I don't like the auto setting, leaving that for when I am taking tourist shots as auto doesn't use raw and the focus can't be changed, but it is OK if all I am doing is taking a shot of a sign which helps explain what the next real shot is all about.  Like when taking interesting detail shots in Soho in London and I want to remember what I was thinking, I write it down \"Soho, London, still life in an alley\" and take a picture of it.  Old school GPS.Where this camera can go is into darker situations, in pockets and still perform with excellent quality, because when I am walking on a path and look up to see the sun shining through some clouds in behind a tree in a way that the scene really looks like it is on fire, I don't want to look back on that shot and think, wow, what a great moment, too bad the clouds look all fuzzy because I didn't have my good camera on hand.  Fortunately, my companion had her Canon that day and now I have one.What would I ask Canon to improve?  I'd suggest a slightly longer zoom, yes.  I think they could stretch this and still have a nice lens.  I would really want a faster lens.  I like being able to take photos at 2.0 aperture and would love if they could get 2.8 out of the current range.  It is still better than the competition, but there is potential. That'd be worth a bit of space.Then add another small dial on top for more manual control. One on the top, one on back (which it already has). It would be brilliant.  It already can use the dial on back and the lens ring, but I'd like to focus as well.  Already, a little compact camera that one can directly change the aperture and shutter speed with a dial (or program a dial for something else if you must) just like a real DSLR camera!  I just want to be able to set the front ring as a focus ring and still do it.  It would be pocket size photo nirvana.  As is, it isn't hard to change and I've not seen the like in a point and shoot.I'd also like to see it made weather proof.  I always worry about dust and scratches and rain.  I've had cameras lost to dust and worry about rain showers.In truth, I worry that Canon probably doesn't put so much into this, the market is too small and the cost for the sensor is high, but I think the market is building and a great niche, so come on, throw some resources on this great little camera.It really is a great camera for just taking photos. It is no DLSR, but the only better cameras are made by Nikon and Canon and are all bigger, starting with the G12 and the Nikon P7000.  I took some photos with owners of a G12, a panasonic GF2 (I think) and a Canon EOS1D Mark III and all were impressed and funny enough, none of them had their cameras handy because they are harder to carry around.It is a little power house.", "Date": "June 6, 2011"}, {"Title": "Comparable to my DSLR", "Author": "Rishi Raj", "ReviewID": "R1BO1AQ5N0YBMV", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Have been using digital cameras for some time now.

No fault of the Camera itself, these things happen, but in addition to the dead pixels, I have other issue with the camera which I shall explain further.Let's jump straight in to the pros and cons, in no particular order.pros:1. compact size.2. excellent image quality, very sharp.3. manual controls, if you are looking for a camera that will help you improve and grow your understanding of manual photography, this is a great place to start.4. f/2.0 aperture = great for low light.5. nice 3\" LCD, bright and clear.cons:1. SPEED. I made the mistake in buying this camera when I should have bought a DSLR. it's not the S95's fault, it was mine for not testing the camera out in a shop before buying, I thought it would meet my needs, but I was wrong. If you are intending to use this for stop action photography, meaning kids and pets, think again. While it will take great images, it will not take them when you want. There is a slight delay. By the time you half press the shutter, auto focus, and then take the shot, the moment is long gone. So expect to take around 10 shots of your kids on the swings to find 1 image that is a keeper. I didn't expect DSLR like speeds, but the S95 really doesn't offer anything different compared to my 3 year old Canon SD6300 6MP camera, in terms of speed.2. Flash location, I'm sure everyone knows by now that it's in a terrible spot.3. Movie recording is pretty much useless on the S95. No autofocus or optical zoom means that you either have to shoot a static subject or forget about recording movies altogether. I downloaded the CHDK hack for the S95 which lets you autofocus and zoom optically in movie mode but even that is not ideal as you have to boot up the camera in playback mode, update the firmware, then switch to live mode to record a movie. It get's on my nerves having to do this every time. It's 2010 for god's sake. Camera 5 years old used to autofocus and zoom optically in movie modes.4. Battery life is poor. 200 pics is just not enough, so if you get this camera, get a couple spares.conclusion:All in all, the S95 is a great compact camera. I have definitely taken many keepers in the last month. The images are very high quality and sharp for a camera of this size. And while it didn't meet my needs in a camera, it is no fault of the camera. Just be sure you understand its limitations before buying it. It is not a fast camera, you have to pace yourself when shooting, and I've already explain why video recording is a pain with this camera for anything other than still subjects. But for everything else (portraits, landscapes, still life, etc) this camera is probably the best compact on the market today. I know the LX5 and others are better technically, but they are not as compact as the S95 and thus is the reason why the S95 is so popular.So as long as things like the slow operational speed and limited movie mode don't bother you (other cons like flash location and battery life can be worked around, not a deal breaker) then I think you will really enjoy this camera, especially if you are looking for a compact camera to help you understand photography better and move away from the green auto mode.", "Date": "January 1, 2011"}, {"Title": "This is the professional point and shoot camera", "Author": "Weihao Lu", "ReviewID": "RMF1QLVMLKCPF", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Coming from DSLR, I have to say the picture quality is just as good.The biggest plus of this camera I've found is the HDR mode.

I have attached most of my original review of the S90 at the bottom of this update for those who don't know much about the S80/S90/S95 series....1)  Let's get down to what most of you care about:  The HD video.  It's good.  Not great, but exactly what you expected.  Exactly.  The 720p ability is not what everyone wanted, but it's a huge improvement and it works.  Zero jellyvision and the IS stays true to form.  Jaggies are minimal and sound is improved but can still be blown out by loud noise (such as a concert which I simulated with my stereo - and probably causing my neighbors to all go WT...?).One negative is that you can still not change focal length while shooting.Comparing the video to a Canon T2i with an 'L\" series lens, the S90 frankly performs better.  While not as sharp, there are less jaggies and the internal IS makes a huge difference.Comparing the video to an HD Flip, there is no comparison.  Forget 1080p, the better optics and system will make the S95 your go-to camera for easy video.Comparing the video to an Apple iPhone 4, surprise.  The iPhone is the sharpest of all four, however it's lack of IS and the jellyvision factor make the S95 far superior.  Kudos to Apple though for sticking such an amazing camera in a phone (plus Apple doesn't blow out sound like the S95).I'll see if I can post some video or a link, but believe me when I tell you that the low light video is amazing.  I'm an airline pilot and I've been able to record night approaches and lightening storms that no other camera including my T2i could capture.In conclusion, I'm very, very satisfied with the video upgrade.  Very satisfied.2)  Feel & Handling  The smooth texture of the S90 never really bothered me but that said, the new matte finish is definitely an improvement.  While the specs say otherwise, the S90 feels heavier and more solid.  This isn't a word, but everything is just more \"clickier\".  It doesn't feel \"platicy\" anymore.  I like it.3)  That Darn Backside Control Dial.  O.K.  I HATED that thing on the S90.  The S95 provides an improvement, but am I the only one who thinks it's still too \"loose\"?  While you won't inadvertently change settings by just bumping the backside, it's still pretty easy to do.  I would have preferred something - again - \"clickier\" but it is definitely an improvement.  Thank gawd.4)  A Kind of Big Negative/Warning  If you buy the S95 buy a 3\" screen protector at the same time.  Unlike the S90, the back of the S95 is completely flat and there is no protective recess around the screen.  I'm not sure if they've put Gorilla Glass on this new version, but I know I scratched my S90 almost immediately and the S95 looks like it might get scratched easier.  That said, I like how clean the new controls are.5)  Eye-Fi  No one really mentions this, but the S95 adds Eye-Fi card support built in to the OS.  From what I can tell so far, it doesn't do much except have an on/off control for uploading but what it DOES do is NOT turn off the camera for power savings while uploading.  Huge bonus.  Mahalo Canon for working with Eye-Fi!!!6)  No Manual  This really ticks me off.  You know the small pocket sized manual that Canon always includes with their consumer cameras.  No more.  They refer you to a .pdf copy located on the CD-ROM (you can also downloaded from the support web page however that version has an irritating watermark).  This just really ticks me off.  I'm all for saving trees but if I spend $400 on a high end consumer camera, I still think I deserve a hard copy of the manual.  Boo hiss Canon!Finally, I'll amend this review when I get a better idea of the new Hybrid IS technology and HDR functions work but I can say that without a doubt, the addition of 720p video and improving (but not fixing) the control dial make this a worthy upgrade for me.  Yeah, it sucks that I had to dish out another $400 but my S90 will now become a dedicated U/W camera and considering how often I flood them (at least once every two years - that's how my beloved S80 died) it's worth it to me.For those who have never used the S90, my original review is below.  The short version:  You will NOT be disappointed with the S95 if you take the time to learn how to use it.  Otherwise, save some $$$ and pick up the SD4000....ORIGINAL S90 REVIEW:Be warned, I am a self professed camera geek. I believe cameras are like surfboards; you need a quiver of surfboards/cameras for the right wave/job.The Canon S90 is - by far - my new \"go to\" pocket camera and the one I will always carry with me in my flight bag. I have been using it for just about a month now and after a couple thousand shots, only now am I getting comfortable with its functionality. This is NOT the camera to buy your mother-in-law for Christmas. She will never speak to you again.My other cameras are:Canon 7D - with 'L' series lenses.Pentax W60 (waterproof) - for surfing, sailing, biking, hiking, skiing and handing to the kids to beat each other with over the head.Canon SD980 - which was my *quality* pocket camera but will now be relegated purely to U/W scuba photography (since I own the U/W case anyway and would live in fear that my S90 meets the same fate as my S80 and gets flooded shark diving in Tahiti).Here's the deal with the new Canon S90: If you are willing to delve into the sub menus and experiment it will become a very, very powerful camera in your arsenal. It can do anything the G11 can do but because of the size you might have to work a little harder initially to figure out the functionality curve. It's like flying. Once your familiar with the controls (which takes awhile) the interface becomes transparent and you can make it do just about anything you want. But it will take a lot of tinkering. No lie.I'll leave the critique on picture quality for the professional sites but will just offer this: the results are very good for the size of the camera. The low light performance is best in class, period; and I've tried them all including the LX3 (which is also darn good but noisier - love that 24mm lens though).Bottom line, if you want SLR quality go buy an SLR. You're not going to get the same results with the S90. Duh. If you don't like small cameras or have large fingers then maybe you should look at something like the G11. The S90 is *too small* for all of its functionality but that's the dichotomy, isn't it? The functionality is all there but by design is forced into a sometimes frustratingly cramped interface. That said, this camera is very good at what it is: a pocket camera with a wide fast lens that can shoot in RAW.Let's talk about size. I'll agree that the build quality initially seems *cheaper* than what you would expect. That said, the case, dials, and shutter are all solid in real life day to day use. Especially the shutter. To be honest, it's a bit strange but you can't deny the light weight and I love that it's smooth and flat and easily fits into your jeans. It's as small as any compact with the exception of the lens ring/bulge and while I wish the bulge weren't there, it is what it is and the functionality of that ring is surprisingly awesome. It's definitely more pocketable than the LX3. The screen is gorgeous and I don't miss the viewfinder at all.The power up/down flash is irritating and I pray it doesn't break but I got to admit there is less red-eye than most cameras (which is supposedly why they went with the design). As long as the motor doesn't give out because I'm inadvertently holding the flash down when it tries to pop up I'll live with it and tip my hat to Canon's engineers.The control ring functionality is awesome and the Ring Function button is very, very functional and remains customized for each \"mode\" you select. In this way you can set up your camera for high speed Av photography different than for say Tv photography. Nice.On that functionality, making this camera do what you want really boils down to getting to know the camera. After a month, I can finally adjust aperture, shutter speed, and the four directional manual white balance without thinking about it. ISO, exposure bracketing, flash intensity, metering, and continuous shooting are just a button/spin/button/spin away. Once you've memorized the function layout, exposure adjustments are fairly quick and painless. And of course you've got the outer control ring and function ring give you instant access to two of your major settings wether that be ISO, exposure metering, manual focus, white balance, zoom, aperture, or shutter speed. You're really wasting the power of this camera if you just leave it in Av so you can shoot \"fast\".Whew. Exhausted yet? If you are then maybe this camera isn't for you. ;) No, seriously.However, if you are willing to commit yourself Canon has given you the tools to get the shot you want. Or I suppose you could just leave it in AUTO.I'll see if I can figure out how to upload some sample shots but here are some real life experiences I've had. Day shots of the NYC skyline are beautiful. A little soft compared to a Canon 7D with an 'L' series lens, but like I said before, duh. The same shot at night can be accomplished without a tripod at about 1/60 of a second. No blur. At an English Beat concert the other night I was snapping away at f2.0 (wide) and 1/100 of a second. Not always fast enough but about five times what I could do with my SD980. Stepping it down from ISO100 to 800 sped it up and while a little noisier, fit the concert like feel. Ice skating at night at Rockefeller Center (well lit) I was taking photos without the flash as if it were daytime. In summary, this camera rocks.UPDATE: Low light photos uploaded to Amazon. Look for NYC skyline and adjacent concert pics. Unfortunately Amazon resolution is limited but you'll get the idea of what you can get away with.The one thing I don't get is the 640X480 movie mode. I ask why, why, why knowing full well that there is an engineering answer that hasn't found its way on to the Interwebs yet. Somewhere in the software/hardware mix there must be an answer because not including HD video is inexplicable to me. On the other hand, most video I take with this kind of camera just gets uploaded to YouTube anyway so 640X480 is fine. That's what I've got a dedicated HD camcorder for. One thing I will add, the sound quality is noticeably better than any other mono point and shoot I've used. I'm not sure what's up with that but it's noticeably clearer with deeper base. Kind of a nice surprise, really.At the end of the day this is a great camera and a very worthy successor to my beloved (and flooded) Canon S80. If you want the smallest *quality* camera you can currently buy the S90 is it. There are a few issues but that beautiful fast lens makes them bearable. If you want an SLR like interface and are willing to sacrifice the size, then you should take a serious look at the G11 (or similar). This camera is too small for that kind of interface and while the top level functions are intuitive (aperture, shutter speed, ISO) you'll have to commit yourself a little to go any deeper. The beauty is, you can!Bottom line: If I lost this camera today I'd buy another tomorrow.

The S95 was comparable to the Nikon in low light conditions.  My most surprising revelation was that the 870is is a pretty great camera too.

Keeping track of a loose lens cap on the LX5 worried me also.  I ended up replacing the LX5 with the Canon S95.  I have been very happy with this camera.  The menus are easy to use with a large variety of options, the screen is bright and sharp, the quality of photos is excellent, and the battery life is good.  Being able to assign the lens ring to different functions is very handy. The camera body is less slippery than the S90, however, I still opted for the Richard Franiec S95 grip which makes the camera much more secure in my hand.  The control ring has also been improved over the S90 but still moves fairly easily so I opted for the Lensmate control dial ring which inexpensively solves that problem.  There are three things I don't like about the camera.  Two are fairly insignificant but one does bother me.  The wrist strap that comes with the camera has no slider to tighten it around your wrist so it's just one big loop that will easily slide off your hand.  I am using a wrist strap from another camera.  The plastic door that covers the USB port does not have a solid feel when closing and it makes me feel like its going to flip back open.  I worry that it will not close properly after many openings and closings so I opted for a card reader instead. The one major point I do not like about the camera is the way the flash is operated.  In order to turn on the flash the camera must be supported in the left hand and the natural position of your left index finger is right on top of the flash that is trying to pop up.  It is also easy to push the flash button on the control ring with your thumb when you don't want to. First it will run into your left index finger then it will take several strokes to get the flash back to the off position.  My ideal situation would be a switch operated by the left hand that when pushed would raise the flash.  Or at least have the button that is not right under the thumb.  All in all this is the best point and shoot camera I have ever owned (this is my 6th) and would highly recommend it.10/27/10  -  One thing I forgot to mention when I first wrote this review is a program the LX5 has that I wish would be incorporated in the S95.

My needs on this purchase included: something small, and easy to carry around and good quality images (I am a studio art major and in some conditions I need to take some good shots of a class' still life _that I cannot obviously  take home with me_ or some of my own paintings to post up on the web). In addition I wanted a camera that I could take with me when I go out at night with some friends: the ability to take pics in dim light was not exactly a primary need but it wouldn't hurt to have it as well. My price range was around 300 dollars, but if anything stood out I wouldn't mind to make some compromise for amazing features.That being said, I narrowed my search between the LX5 and S95. Being paranoid of buying such an expensive item through the internet i read multiple reviews before I made up my mind on the latter. Though the LX5 was judged to capture blown away images, I felt uneasy about its size and lens cap (I should add that I also had a military ball to attend in a few days, and I needed to make sure that this camera could fit in my clutch!). I am not exactly a photo enthusiast, and I knew that the default setting and jpeg images was what i was gonna use for a while, before i took time to learn more. Although the S95 would not match the LX5's RAW shots, the jpegs were supposed to.This is what I can say so far from my experience:-Not too impressed by the image stabilization. If your hand is not steady enough, count your shots to be blurry (the LX5 is supposed to be better at that).-More grainy than I would expect, for my certain zoomed pics (but hey, it is a compact camera after all, and for my normal shots, the pics were pretty good. The LX5 blocky lens probably come to better use for that)-Worked pretty great in low light (the ball was held in pretty dark rooms to create ambiance and there, at least, the S95 held on its own)-Fit nicely inside the small purse along with my numerous items, and its compact design overall is pretty nice ( not that it is quite that important but its a nice bonus)-Images' color in normal don't seem to quite match the actual setting, but still pretty closeOverall not too bad... Im sure as I learned more its manual control, its worth would be even closer to how much I spend for it! Im not sure if I would have still chosen over the LX5  had I had a chance to have a hand held experience (for some reason even best buy doesn't hold it in display...).

Simply put, it is an amazing camera, jamb packed with just about every tool that a novice or pro could want. There is much to read and absorb for learning the capabilities of the S95.

Because of health and baggage weight issues, I decided to limit myself to one rolling carry-on bag that could -- while going to and from a cruise -- carry 1-2 camera systems, a monopod, a 5-pound  laptop,  and a 4-pound Canon iP-100 color printer.On the cruise, while shooting around the ship and on land tours, I want to limit myself to about 3-4 pounds for the cameras, lenses, monopod and bag; and ensure that at least one camera is able to be carried in a front pants pocket.On my last 2 cruises I carried a Panasonic Lumix GH1 with the 14-140 and 20 mm lenses, and a Canon \"shirt-pocket\" SD780 IS  for walking around the ship and going places where cameras were at risk or frowned upon.  This setup weighed 7 pounds in the bag and it took care of my photographic needs beautifully; but it's increasingly difficult to take all this on walking tours and take candids of day-to-day life on the ships.  I also ended up adding a 2-pound 24\" carbon fiber SLYK monopod with a ballhead to my luggage when I discovered that video requires a more stable platform than most humans can provide; and upgrading the GH1 to a GH2 on general principles.Planning for my next cruise, I replaced my aging SD780 IS with a Canon S95 \"front pants pocket camera\" and discovered, to my delight, that up to the 8x10\" prints I can produce on my little portable printer, the S95's image quality is very close to the GH1/GH2's; and it can even shoot decent videos (but not in the GH1/GH2 class) with just a 7-oz, 15\" monopod to steady it; as well beautiful indoor candid shots thanks to its f2.0 lens.  Thus for my next trip in May, I've reduced my cruise camera package from 7 pounds to 1 pound, and its replacement cost from about $2000 to $500.I think that the S95 is already close to the perfect cruise ship camera, and \"all\" I'm looking for right now is a second camera: a 1-pound super zoom camera with at least a 20x zoom ratio, an electronic finder nearly as good as the GH1/GH2's finder (LCDs are virtually useless on bright days on the water), and print quality that's at least as good as the S95's up to 8x10s.  After looking at all the available models, I don't think that this \"second camera\" exists yet; but I believe it will be available in the next generation of super zooms that will hopefully be available by Christmas.  I believe it can be done by Canon by adding the S95's sensor and a higher quality electroncic  finder to an update of the SX30 IS; or by Nikon whose P500 has everything but -- in my opinion -- the sensor quality of the S95 and a viewer that's nearly as good as the GH2's; or by Panasonic or Olympus when they decide to produce a 4/3 super zoom with an internal GH2-quality electronic finder.  Any of these probabilities will result in a great camera to shoot boats and long-range candids for around one additional pound of weight; and allow me to end up with a 2-pound, 2-camera, (hopefully) $1,000 system that provide all the capabilities I need for all my styles of cruise shooting.For virtually everyone else however, I've no hesitation in annnointing the Canon PowerShot S95 as my choice as \"2011 Cruise Camera of the Year.\"", "Date": "April 17, 2011"}, {"Title": "Canon Powershot S95: Amazing", "Author": "byrno", "ReviewID": "R1BTBN31OCG9BG", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "The price for the camera matches the high quality and long features list.Surprisingly heavy for the size but such a powerful camera, it leaves my Digitial SLR sitting on the shelf a lot more often.Basically functions as a point and shoot all the way up to eating into features you used to only get on the DSLRs but much more compact.Guaranteed you'll catch your finger on the automated flash moving down at some stage but, only a minor complaint on an otherwise excellent camera.", "Date": "April 8, 2011"}, {"Title": "Love the features", "Author": "Konacoffee", "ReviewID": "R12PXO2KZLZPRX", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I got this camera mostly for fun as I'm mainly a dslr Canon photographer.

This was something i never tried to do on my old camera, im not even sure if my old one could. This one was easy to figure out and i am no camera expert. The pictures i have taken so far blow me away compared to the norm ive had over the past 5 years. I am in love with my new camera. There is so much more that i can play around with.My only complaint is the wrist strap. it's just one big loop that hangs around your wrist and could fall off very easily. i plan on purchasing a new one that has a way of adjusting the hole to fit my wrist. My old canon had a great wrist strap so i dont know why they would get rid of them. Other than that i highly recommend to people who want a great camera in a small package.", "Date": "March 19, 2011"}, {"Title": "AWESOME CAMERA!!!

I wasn't supposed to buy a PowerShot in a while, since 8 months ago I bought a Canon SX210IS in order to have a short trips substitute for my Canon Rebel XSi. I was quite disappointed with the SX210, since it took blurry, not well defined and colorless pictures. Last december, it was stolen from my luggage so I had to buy a new one (my second chance, this time I had to buy a good one). After 8 months, I though not much should have changed, but then I saw many reviews about the new S95 and I was curious. After surfing around, I found this webpage in which you can check and compare easily the specs and other information about many cameras on the market.[...]My first concern, was the flash thing (that it was placed in an unconfortable and not intuitive place). FORGET ABOUT IT. The SX210 was a real pain in the a.., every time I wanted to take a picture I found my finger stopping the flash to pop up. With the S95, even if the flash is placed in the same place, it has enough space behind to let you place your finger without interfering with the flash.The zoom is perfect! Even the digital zoom is amazing.The size and weight, no comments! Just great!But the more important thing about this camera is how amazing and beautiful the pictures come out. It's magic! It just interprets exactly what your eyes see, no more, no less. It has been a while since I am not as happy with an electronic product as I am with this camera!

I have gone through Sony, Nikkon, and other Canan point shoot cameras. This camera gave the best Low light photos and that was my biggest priority. I choose not to ever use the flash now. So nice to just take natural shots with natural colors. Using the manual feature you can turn any night time photo into a day time photo. You just need to know how to use the shutter, aperture, and iso levels. This is the only point shot camera that alows you to control everything. The price is worth every penny because once you buy a camera your stuck with it for a while and you want to get the most out of every penny you pay.

It's a time-tested camera, one that even the pros return to repeatedly, coaxing prize-winning photos from it time and time again.  Not only does the camera afford the user less automation and more control (including the ability to produced raw, non-compressed images), but its \"reasonable\" cap of 10 megapixels (instead of the 12 or more that are increasingly being jammed into small cameras) produces shots that are ultimately clearer, deeper, richer, and more \"verisimilitudinous\" than those taken with cameras weighed down by excessive baggage.Even though point-'n-shoots now have ISO settings running up to 6400, 12,800 and higher, the small sensors of these cameras tend to pick up more distortion, or \"noise,\" which is merely made more conspicuous by high megapixel counts.  The more megapixels manufacturers cram onto these sensors, the more visual flaws you can expect to see in the images.If you've ever wondered why your 3.2mp camera of 7-8 years ago seemed to produce better pictures than the 16mp miniature camera you recently picked up, it shouldn't be a mystery.

I purchased it as a replacement for the Powershot Elf 300HS which was good in many respects, but falls short of the quality and consistency of the S95.  This one will stay in my arsenal and on my belt loop holster when I need a great kick-around reliable camera.  The 10 MP photos are stunning.  For quick-fire everyday shots, I use the vivid setting available in the \"P\" or program mode.  Everything else is automatic and I rarely do much editing to the shots.  If I want to tweak the results, the processed jpegs lend themselves readily to adjustment tweaks in photoshop or whatever program you use.  Raw is available if that's your bag.  The low light capabilities of the S95 are good for both photos and videos.  I can't complain about the 720 Hi Def.  It's plenty powerful for the slideshows and Blu Ray discs that I produce and creates efficiency by saving both time and space when burning discs-i.e., the files aren't so large as to be space hogs.  The slide shows produced from this little beauty are as good as it gets and I have burned some really impressive bluray discs.  Most of the S95 shots on \"Program\" need no editing or adjustment whatsoever.  Just load 'em up, add motion and transitions, a little background music and burn away!  The results are wonderful, colorful, and professional looking.There is very little lag time photo to photo and I rarely find myself waiting for the camera to complete any processing.  Just fire it up and take off.  It's ready when you are.  For its size & weight, I think it's one of the best & highest quality pieces of consumer photo equipment Canon ever built.  And I put the quality of it's photos right up there with my highly acclaimed Canon Powershot G12 which is considerably larger & heavier.  Either of these camera's make a great backup for my Canon 60d SLR, but I'd prefer to carry the S95 over either of them.  The only time I use the larger units is when I need a more powerful flash in the hotshoe.  Oh, and the 3\" digital screen display is a beauty.  I used it last week in bright sunlight, and didn't have significant problems framing my shots.I recommend the S95 without hesitation to anyone wanting high quality photos in a strong lightweight camera that's comfortable in your purse, pocket, or belt holster.NOTE TO CANON:  If I could add one thing to the S95 to make it a perfect unit, I would add a little video record button that was available full time like the Elf 300 HS rather than having to spin the mode dial to the movie mode.

I have an older canon dslr that has been my main camera for several years now, and as much as I love it and the pictures that it takes I needed something more portable. But I wasn't willing to sacrifice quality or control. This camera could not be more perfect in that regard. It takes amazing pictures and decent video, and I can still change any of the settings that I would ever really need to change. I will say that the preset settings on this camera do a pretty decent job on there own. I've been particularly impressed by the low light setting. However I love having the ability to tweak the setting if necessary.  This camera is also perfect in size, nice and small without being too small, and fast too. The shutter lag is virtually non-existant! And we all know how important that last one is. Nothing is worse than missing the picture because you are waiting on your camera, and that has not been as issue with this camera!  I love that this camera uses rechargeable batteries! The battery life is decent, and with the spare I bought as a backup I don't think a dead battery will ever cause me to miss a photo. My one complaint is the pop up flash. It pops up exactly where you naturally want to place your finger to hold the camera. I have gotten used to it and try to hold the camera with just my right hand. But, if anyone else is using my camera (say to take a picture with me in it) they always place their finger over the flash which sometimes prevents it from popping up.  I worry that this will eventually cause the flash to break. However that is a problem I was aware of when I got the camera, and it would not prevent me from buying this camera again.

I have not been disappointed.  For cameras of this type, most of the \"practical\" features are very similar.  My decision to purchase this camera came down to 4 distinct criteria.  First was the \"manufacturer.\"  Canon is one of the primary leaders in photographic quality.  Their reputation is solid.  Secondly, I wanted a camera with a \"fast\" lens.  The wider the aperture, the better the light gathering capability the camera has.  At a wide angle setting, the stated aperture is F 2.0.  Few cameras meet this criteria.  Third, having a \"long zoom\" was not that important to me.  I wasn't going on a safari and many of my images would be taken indoors of family and friends.  If I need closer up images of my subject, I merely move closer.  Finally, \"price\" was a major consideration.

I can then take it and change the settings to make it shutter speed priority, aperture priority, or use it entirely in manual mode.  I can record pictures in jpeg, jpeg+raw.  I can use autofocus, or I can focus manually.  All with this small, thin, relatively inexpensive camera.  If you like picking up your camera and taking pictures, you'll like the S95.

I still think this camera is nothing short of amazing for all the photographic firepower it packs into such a small body.The S95 is well made and feels very solid. It doesn't have a front grip like its successor does but the textured surface makes it fairly easy to grip and hold onto. It is the only enthusiast compact that is truly pocketable. It doesn't have a hotshoe like the other cameras in this class do. But I really don't see a lot of people attach external flashes to their enthusiast compacts. It sort of defeats the whole purpose.The menu system is like most of other Canon's point and shoots. You have your menu button and then your function button. Both are contextual based on what mode you are shooting in. The main attraction of this camera is the rotating lens ring, which you can customize to what ever function you want it to perform. This is part of what makes this camera so great to use.The zoom range on the camera is only 3.8x. Which some people may find too little for what they do. The powershot G12, which uses the same sensor as the S95, has a 5x zoom, so that might be something in the favor of that camera model if you're deciding on the S95 vs. the G12 (you can't go wrong with either, IMO).This is not a very fast camera, but it is faster than its predecessor, the S90. You will find the Autofocus speed tolerable, though. Shot to shot times are mediocre, not terrible, but some of the other models are a little bit fast than the S95.It's photo quality is excellent considering its sensor size. Colors are vibrant, exposure is great, and sharpness and detail capture are excellent for this class of camera. My observation is that photos are pretty clean up to and including ISO400. There's some noticeable noise at ISO800, but photos can still be usable at that sensitivity as well. ISO1600 is not great looking. But, considering its sensor size, this is a pretty good showing.This camera of course shoots in RAW as well which will help you pull some extra detail out of the photos at higher ISOs especially. The jpegs look good, but shooting in RAW will get you superior results.Overall, given its enthusiast level feature set and its excellent functionality and superb photo quality, this is a camera that I recommend to anybody, novice or enthusiast.", "Date": "December 29, 2011"}, {"Title": "Possibly the best point-and-shoot in the market today", "Author": "Relentless \"skepticalbeliever\"", "ReviewID": "RJCLWR2PM2QIG", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I'm writing this review from the perspective of a photography hobbyist for 20+ years. The first thing I have to make clear is that you have to bring your expectations in line with what this camera is at the end of the day: a point-and-shoot. It does take very good pictures, but don't expect them to be comparable to those that can be taken with a DSLR -- period.Now, there are couple reasons I gave a four-star rating:* Fish-eye effect is quite frankly atrocious. If you have ever taken pictures with a real fish-eye lens, you'll immediately notice that the effect in this camera is almost comical, looks nothing like the real thing -- not even close.* Not fat-finger friendly. Has lost of controls, nobs, rings, etc. that are small and close together which can be a pain to deal with if you have above average finger width.* User manual (the real one) is online and print only. Which makes it quite annoying when you're on the go and trying to look up certain functionality.* ISO's above 400 yield a tad too much noise to be useful or fit for printing (without some serious noise reduction post process).Why should you buy this camera?* This camera has one of the best image processors in the market (Digic IV), one of the largest photo sensors for a point-and-shoot and relatively low megapixel count -- this is actually a really good thing I wish more manufacturers would start doing.* Very good picture quality, color rendition for such small camera.* Very reasonable amount of noise under ISO 400, degrades quickly at 800-plus.* Tilt-shift (Miniature) effect is actually very good and pretty darn close the real thing.* Lens is reasonably good, very nice and sharp at apertures of 6.3-plus.* Very nice Macro mode with very nice bokkeh (very nice to see in a point-and-shoot).In all, I think this camera is well worth the money and makes for a good \"companion\" camera to bring with you when toting your DSLR is just too cumbersome or risky.", "Date": "December 26, 2011"}, {"Title": "Well worth the price even when not on super sale.", "Author": "Keith.

But I needed a point and shoot for a particular project, and the reviews were very flattering for the 300 HS. Unfortunately, many of the reviewers don't really understand what good quality looks like, especially when it comes to lowlight situations, and effects of ISO. The pictures on the 300 HS were muddy and muted, and anything over ISO 400 looked very grainy and noisy. Perhaps I could have lived with that but the camera also received a lens error message repeatedly within hours of use, rendering it useless. As much as I did not want to spend twice the money,  I decided to go for the S95. It did not exceed my expectations, it did everything I expected from a 400 dollar camera.

There is nothing to be said about the picture quality, it is excellent as claimed by Canon and the reviewers.

Otherwise you just use the zoom lever and there is no numerical feedback as to the focal length. This would free the lens ring for other thingsI wish it had a snap focus setting like the Ricoh GRD III so I could shoot from the hip a bit fasterIf I didnt get this I would probably get the TL500 because of the wider zoom at 24mm, the more solid brick like build, the slightly faster lens and the cheaper price!Thats it in a nut shell!", "Date": "April 18, 2011"}, {"Title": "Great camera overall", "Author": "L.

One of the main reasons was the exclusion of at least 720p video (I have a 7D and i do mostly video work, so i like to see a good movie mode on a digital camera :p).Glad I waited, as the S95 improved upon the already awesome S90. The texture is better for grip, the rear control wheel has detents (to make it easier to manage and not inadvertently turn it while holding the camera), an HDR scene mode and they included HD (720p) movie mode, among other small improvements. It's pocketable, which is what I wanted, since I don't like carrying around my 7D everywhere, which was often not feasible.It shoots in RAW, which is nice -- and it's great in low light due to the big sensor and fast f/2 lens. at ISO800 and even ISO1600, this thing puts out better pictures than my old SD1000 did at ISO400-500!Flash exposure compensation is nice on this camera, and the dials are really useful for adjusting everything fairly quickly.

Great in low-light without flash, much much much better than the SD4500is that I returned.  Feels very solid.

The popup flash can be annoying but if you take a few easy easy precautions it won't be annoying at all.  Small price to pay for such great pictures and manual capabilities.  Video is also really nice, and the stereo sound for the video is really good as well.A few negatives:1)  Popup flash - after only a few days of use I've gotten used to the popup flash, the problem is when you give the camera to someone else to use to take a picture of you or something.  They almost always grab it by the popup flash, and that really makes me worried that someone else is going to ruin my precious camera lol.  I just usually leave the camera on P mode, and leave the flash setting on \"off\", so it doesn't popup every time you turn on the camera.  Then if i want the flash to be on it takes like literally 1 second to turn it on using the flash button on the rear of the camera.2)  Control wheel at the top of the camera is sort of annoying.

The LX5 was just that much larger so that it was too bulky to fit comfortably in my jacket pocket and the removable lens cap was a real bother.  A street camera needs to be quick to the eye and removing (or remembering to remove it in the first place) the lens cap just added another delaying step to the process.  Canon learned a number of lessons with their S90 and the improvements to the S95 show that they can learn.  The Cons: I will repeat the lamentation of so many other reviewers - Give me back the paper manual!  A short sighted cost saving measure on Canon's part as it may prevent the customer from using the the most of all of its features.  The included Canon RAW software is still awkward to use and I do use RAW a lot so I will have to upgrade my other software.  Maybe Canon can drop the inadequate software and restore the manual.

You can have it set for manual focus, exposure, ISO, White Balance, etc. The one mode which I found doesn't work too well was the fireworks mode. Keeps the shutter open to long.This has a Super Vivid mode which really makes the colors pop. No need to do the contrast curve in Photoshop! The only problem is that it is a shooting mode, not a setting which can be used while in other modes.

It has an ISO 3200 low light mode that I used to take some amazingly crisp pictures at night, where the only source of light was ambient urban.  The other strengths of this camera are well described by other reviewers, but include compact size, bright and sharp screen, great color (though at times a little too punchy), and fairly logical and easy to use controls.  The images are generally sharp, though a little less than what I get with a Nikon D40 SLR.  This is only detectable when images are massively enlarged on the computer screen, and may not be relevant for most prints.  I found 4 x 6 prints, for example, to look comparable with the two cameras, and would anticipate similar results for 8 x 10 prints.  The shortcomings are a short battery life, exacerbated by a misleading battery life indicator that goes from full to near-dead in an instant, the lack of a viewfinder, and (at least compared with the D40) relative slowness to meter and shoot.Overall, this is an outstanding camera for someone who wants excellent pictures, the ability to program a wide range of settings, all in a compact format.

However, this camera will make you want more.It's very conveniently sized and you can virtually take it anywhere.  Even though I own an SLR, I will still use this camera as an everyday carry item when an SLR is not feasible to tote around since they aren't exactly known for their small size.  The aperture stops down to f/2.0 which is great for taking pictures in dark areas, which is rare for a camera this small.Though it has many things going for it, it does have its shortcomings.  The manual controls are pretty limited.  Even the though the camera can stop down to f/2.0, it only goes up to f/8.0 on the other end which doesn't make much of a difference in the depth of field department.  Also, as with any camera this size, it handles higher ISO's fairly poorly.  Personally, I think that after you hit about 300~400 ISO, the pictures start to become hard to look at which will definitely limit your options.  I've also noticed that the front glass gets dirty very quickly, and because it's so small, it's damn near impossible to clean.  Another thing I've noticed is that this camera is kind of fragile.  Though the build quality is great and feels solid, don't expect it to take any kind of drop or rough treatment.  One random thing that I've noticed with it is that right out of the box, this camera smells really bad.  It airs out in about a week though.All in all, this camera is recommended, but if you're looking to buy it for its manual control, just use the $400 to get yourself an SLR.", "Date": "June 25, 2011"}, {"Title": "So Far So Good", "Author": "Davis", "ReviewID": "R3D2YK63L2Q57I", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I just bought this camera for my Vegas trip last week. Was debating on whether to get the Nikon S8100 or this one, glad I chose the S95. It took outstanding pictures on Auto. I haven't used manual yet so I can't comment on that. Also brought my Canon PowerShot A590IS which is 8.0 megapixels. I found myself using the S95 alot more than my A590IS. We mostly took pictures at night with the S95 and they came out amazing! It definately takes great night shots or with dim lighting. My A590IS didn't even compare. I know they're different series but still i was impressed. So far i've only had experience with 4 digital cameras, 3 Canons and 1 Fuji and so far the S95 is my favorite! Had to get used to not having a view finder and also the flash that pops up but no biggie. I'm also used to the shot button on the far right hand side like my A590IS, on the S95 the shot button is to the left of dial. As far as battery life I have taken over 300 pictures and it still shows full battery. I was worried it would be a battery eater from some of the comments so I ended up getting another spare one.

I like the Canon S series because I can access manual controls if needed and since I sold my SLR years ago, I really don't feel like I'm missing anything.The S95 is about half the thickness of the old S50 and a fraction of the weight. The outer case has a texture to the finish that helps with grip and prevents fingerprints.  I don't know if it is metal like the old S50, but it sure seems like it.The first thing I noticed is that it starts up in a snap.  That was really important.  Also, it performs very well in low light.  You can turn off the flash during performances and get excellent low light shots.  You can also turn off the sounds and the red-eye lamp to not be so obvious.  My only gripe is that I wish you could turn off the flash and it would stay off when you turn the camera back on.  The controls are pretty intuitive so it isn't that big of a deal.  Oh, and it seems to handle jitter well in low light.  I've got great shots of a school musical that are colorful, clear and crisp. No grain. No blurs.For the most part, I use the SCN mode and select Kids and Pets.  That takes care of motion well.  There are some nice effects that you can do including a fisheye effect which could keep you busy for hours on end.I'm not used to the pop-up flash on the left side. I usually have my finger on it which it doesn't like when it wants to pop up.  You have to get use to a different left hand position.  I'm working on it.I used the HD video to film my daughter figure skating and it is like watching TV when you download it to the PC. Amazing quality and easy to figure out. Just make sure that you let the camera focus before you start filming. If not it seems to be a little out of focus. That could be because I shoot through the protective glass at the ice rink.The software for the PC has been updated.  It is pretty easy to use. There are some differences as compared to the old software. It is faster and has more options. Still figuring all of them out.As far as cases go, I purchased a Lowepro Ridge 10 which was a hair too small.  I returned it for the Ridge 30 which has plenty of room.

So, it may be only a matter of time before this Cannon S95 breaks, but in the meantime I find it amazing, and without a doubt everything i wanted and well worth the 400 dollars.Pros:-Amazing colors! The clarity, sharpness, and color balance are amazing.-Size: for the features and photo quality, the size is perfect. If possibly a bit larger than some compacts, the large size enables a better sensor (which means better photos).-Lens dial; the lens dial at first is a bit odd, but one gets used to it and it quickly is quite convenient.-Wide angle lens. The wide angle photos are not distorted, and quite useful for taking photos of large buildings, groups of people who are close, etc.-Solid build: hard to tell, but it seems heavy and solid.-No touch screen. I have never had a touch screen, but if you are wearing gloves, these are not convenient; and it seems like it would be too easy to touch the screen and change functions by error.-Great indoor photos. Canon was a bit behind Sony in the quality of indoor photos, but the candlelight mode on this camera is amazing! Images are clear and bright, without a tripod.Cons:-Flash pops out automatically, and in auto mode you cannot set the flash to \"on\" - only auto. The flash pops out mechanically in the place where most people put there finger, resulting in possible damage.-Limited auto modes. Some cameras have two dozen \"scene\" modes. this has half of the average. One mode, HDR, is nice.... but requires a tripod. But my iphone does not!-Limited zoom.I take on average 10000 photos per year, due to fairly intense traveling and tourism.

Apparently supplies are short, so the price has gone up.  Supply and demand I guess.I considered a range of options when looking for a new point-and-shoot.  I made my decision based upon reviews of point and shoots from professional camera websites, and from amazon as well.  The S95 from all reviews appeared to be a formidable competitor in this space.  I went with this over the S100 due to complaints over the sensor change from the S95.  There were some negative things said about general quality and low-light performance.  So, I went with the safe choice, money was not a factor.  The prices at the time of purchase were about identical.As it turns out, my research was correct.  The construction of the S95 is excellent.  Very well manufactured, and rugged.  This is a very 'finished' product if you will.  The manufacturing is at least as 'clean' as apple.  I toted this all around europe (spending much of its time in my pocket) and did not have any issues.  I've been using it plenty since, and no issues (maybe a few scratches - my fault).  So far, I've taken probably 3000 pictures with this!  It has seen heavy use.  I've used several brands of SD cards, none of which have given me any grief.As far as features and picture quality, it is hard to find any particular issues.  Picture quality is great (excellent sensor, and excellent optics).  I've framed and hung in my house several of the best pictures I've taken (printed of course not by me, used shutterfly).Features: they're great and easy to use.  I take everything in RAW so I can photoshop if needed with the full feature set.  It's easy to configure F-stop, white balance, ISO speed, exposure, etc.  I shoot everything in manual mode, and the features are so easy to use that it is trivial to do so (not terribly time consuming to change settings).  Props to Canon for making this simple to use in manual mode.The only gripe I have here is what appears to be a bug with the camera's firmware.  When I got up to about 1000 pictures or so on my camera, it wouldn't connect to my laptop I had used dozens of times to download pictures off of it before.  As it turns out, there is a bug where if there are 'too many' pictures for its liking, it won't talk to your desktop / laptop / etc.  Fortunately, I was able to delete a few unwanted pictures, and this fixed the problem.

Shea", "ReviewID": "RJDO8JL10WQ6", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I have a geeky gadgety friend who especially loves cameras, and I asked him to help me pick out a camera.  He suggested this one, and I have to gush - I love it.  The picture quality is freakin' fantastic. I'm going to paste his extremely thoughtful response here:One of the primary things in a camera that affects image quality is the size of the sensor.  A larger sensor has more surface area to detect light.  Also, the larger the sensor the more your ability to take photos with a 'bokeh'-- that blurry background that makes the photos 'pop'.  You're never going to get the quality or the bokeh of a full SLR in a pocket camera, but there are a line of cameras they call the 'premium compact' category that have a larger sensor than their lesser counterparts.  To be in this category, they have a sensor that is 1/1.7\" (0.59\") diagonally across or larger (vs most compacts which have 1/2.5\", 0.4\").One of the other primary factors is how 'fast' the lens is-- that is, it's maximum aperture.  A larger aperture means a larger hole that light comes in through, which once again means more light hitting the sensor.  A larger aperture means you can take photos in lower light scenarios without the flash, and you're less likely to get motion blur.And lastly, higher end compacts have image stabilization, which also helps you take pictures in lower light and with less chance of motion blur.Get the theme here?  The biggest lacking in small cameras is usually that they suck in low light ... they all look great outside on a sunny day, but you go indoors and suddenly the flash wants to pop up in every picture or they come up blurry.The Canon S95 and S100 are the only cameras that are essentially as small as your previous camera.  The others are slightly chunkier, and would probably not fit into women pockets.My mom has the LX5 and it is a great camera as well-- it's essentially the smaller sibling of my camera (the Lumix GF1).  The LX7 is just a newer version of the LX5.  These are great cameras-- I read lots and lots of reviews back in the day comparing the S95 to the LX5 and they are very similar as far as quality ... Because the price is also similar, I would say go with the Canon's, because they're smaller and you're used to the controls.", "Date": "December 6, 2012"}, {"Title": "F2 lens", "Author": "ePk", "ReviewID": "R3UPLXZUBVAKE", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This is a great little camera, emphasis on little.

Sarver \"jzerot1437\"", "ReviewID": "RG95XNY1ZLVK9", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "The Canon S95 is a versatile device that lends users many of the useful features of an SLR at roughly an eighth of the size. The camera offers a full manual mode with a broad range of apertures, ISO levels, and shutter speeds to choose from, allowing those with steady hands or a monopod to produce amazing images at nearly all light levels. All the usual Canon bells and whistles are here--you can define color settings, adjust focal points, etc--but, as an added bonus, the Powershot S95 also shoots in RAW mode. For those unaware, RAW allows for maximum post-production ability, meaning you can adjust exposure, levels, clarity, vividness, etc in a program like Adobe Lightroom once you've uploaded the files to your computer. That having been said, RAW is not a defined format--there are many varieties of RAW floating about, which allow for different levels of control. Fortunately, the S95 RAW is nearly comprehensive, which is impressive given its pocket nature.While shooting video with the S95, you're stuck with whatever zoom length you started shooting at. Obviously, at its tiny size, this camera cannot be expected to feature a superzoom lens, but the tiny 3.8x optical zoom does feel a bit encumbering. Also, the lifecycle of this product is extremely limited; after just over a year and a half, my images now appear washed out and over-exposed, requiring quite a bit of post-work. Granted, I've taken thousands of photos on the product, so I may have simply worn it out early, but the degradation was almost immediate, with no gradual entropy over time.

I love having manual controls and being able to shoot raw instead of jpg. Having a larger sensor than most P&S; camera keeps the noise levels down and the bright lens allows for greater flexibility in low light situations.So, why 4 stars instead of 5? The video. I don't shoot much video and realize that for great quality video you really need a dedicated video camera. But sometimes you want to grab a short video clip with your point and shoot. The S95 shoots 720p and the quality is decent. BUT, it doesn't autofocus nor can you zoom optically while recording. That greatly limits its usefulness. Even my old Panasonic Lumix maintains focus and allows you to zoom while recording. This could be done easily by a firmware update but Canon chose to not do it, likely so that people would buy the replacement (the S100) which shoots 1080p and allows for zooming during recording. That is pretty greedy in my opinion. Based on reviews it seems that quality control is an issue with the S100 with the focal plane not being aligned correctly which results in images being soft/out of focus on one side. Also, the image quality isn't as good as the S90 or S95 as they are cramming more megapixels into the same sensor size which also results in more noise. Given this problem and that it is much more expensive than the S95, I'm happy sticking with the S95 though I do wish they would fix the video issue with a firmware update.The closest competitor is the Panasonic Lumix LX5 which I really debated getting as it has similar image quality but much better video capabilities.

Most have been good for their size, but with the usual trade-offs in image quality, low-light capability, and manual control flexibility.  Finally, the Canon S95 comes along.  This is a serious camera with a reasonable set of trade-offs: low flash power, limited zoom range, and a few other minor issues shared by all other compact cameras.  The S95 has the characteristics I want: great usability, good image quality in a variety of lighting conditions, RAW/JPG image capabilities, minimal shutter lag, good metering, and flexible manual controls.Yes, it does cost a bit more than most other compact digital cameras.  However, this camera should be compared to more expensive digital cameras such as the Canon G12 and Nikon P7000 (I'm sure that statement will raise eyebrows among some fans of those cameras).  Candidly, I like both of those cameras as well, but neither of them can be carried easily in a jacket pocket.  The S95 delivers comparable image quality in a much smaller package.  Of course, you may opt for the other cameras because you want features that aren't included in the S95 (e.g. hot shoe, wireless flash capability).It's worth mentioning I'm not totally biased toward Canon -- My DSLRs are all Nikon bodies.  Although I like the Nikon P7000, the Canon S95 is just what I need in terms of features, quality, size, and price.

It is loaded with many complex features that require a constant review of the manual. Alas there is no manual so be prepared to lug your laptop along to view the manual. No, the PDF supplied will display copy on all pages of portable devices including the IPAD 1, IPAD 2, Kindle, Nook and all smartphones. To view the manual you may want to use your desktop computer or your laptop or net books computer. Canon has gone \"Green\" and is trying to save the planet by not printing the little tiny manual and instead, you must print the manual yourself which will have copy all over it too. If you request a manual from Canon, they will offer a printed 8 1/2by 11 paper copy in 4-6 weeks.Be forewarned, If you purchase this camera before traveling on vacation or a shoot, prepare to learn to use the camera before you travel. Fortunately, Canon has a consistent menu structure in the camera that is not that difficult to learn. If you are new to Canon, this camera is quite complex with the most features you could find on a subcompact camera. If you don't have much time learn the camera, consider a non-Canon camera that comes with a manual. Previous Canon users should be able to figure things out even without a convenient manual.The actual picture quality is as good as it gets with any subcompact camera. I keep discovering new things with the camera when I am traveling because I don't have the manual to refer to. You will have the same problems. I believe this is the reason for some negative reviews.The best qualities for this camera are great low light capability, which means you can get better pictures in low light without flash. it has very good image stabilization, feels great in your hands, nice controls, but a flash that pops up when needed, that can force your finger out of the way if it is coving it. The flash pop up is the most annoying thing with this camera and other cameras like the SX210-SX230 which also have popups. The flash works well and overall the camera could be the best there is in the subcompact field. It is the best there is at the $400 price point.Why 4 stars? The lack of a manual makes for difficult learning of a complex camera, a camera which is meant for travel. You will not learn to use the best settings and will make some errors that could render your pictures inferior to lesser cameras that have just automatic functions.If you never read or pick up a manual, the camera would be 5 stars for you. If the PDF was made readable, then my issues with no manual would be resolved.  Please feel free to comment if you think I am making too big a deal out of not having a readable manual. If you agree with me and you might not purchase a Canon camera because of the lack of a manual, please send your comments directly to Canon. Canon is a great camera and lens company but has made a very poor decision to exclude written operations manuals from it's products.Update:4/11/11I've taken several thousand pictures and am still learning how to get the best out of this fantastic camera. The camera is very complex and needs much time to use it to it's fullest. I've had success with 3200 ISO pictures that are impossible with my other non DSLR cameras. I am constantly amazed at the low light pictures at F2 and ISO's less the 1200. I've had some success at handheld from .1 to 1 second exposure. The image stabilization is impressive. I took 4 digital cameras plus a camcorder on a recent cruise and found myself turning to the S95 because its small size and high quality photos. I took a few video's but prefer a dedicated camcorder with separate mike for obvious reasons. I have several DSLR's with expensive lenses but they are just too bulky. I watched other cruisers with their big DSLR's but they just can't squeeze into your pocket like the S95. I took about 3000 photos and they will serve as a great memory for a wonderful trip. The DSLR users will have somewhat sharper photos of similar scenes but the shear volume of candids that are possible with this camera including food and menus and street scenes are truly priceless mementos.I am glad I purchased this camera and took the time to learn it before resorting to easier to use less capable subcompacts that I already own.Update 1/24/12After using the S95 for over a year I think this maybe my favorite camera to use. I could use my LX5, t2i, FZ150 and others but the S95 is always the first camera I take with me. What makes this such a standout is the overall picture quality, ease of use and pocket ability. It is not perfect but it comes close. I originally rated this 4 stars but raised it to 5 stars which is what it deserves.Update: 3/28/13I've used this fantastic camera for 2 1/2 years now and have taken over 5000 images. It's still a favorite camera and often the first camera I will look for and bypass the 60d, FZ150 superzoom, GH2 micro 4/3 camera which are all great cameras. Why? I can put it in my pocket and take anywhere, great images, extremely reliable, fast startup, fast focus, and quick put away. This is the longest lasting subcompact camera I've used and not updated. I usually update yearly but this camera was so outstanding I decided to wait. I will try the Canon S110 model because it has a touch screen interface and has a little better low light capability with a higher iso and avchd video recording. Several of my other cameras have touch screens and it adds a lot to the user experience. I will keep the Canon S95. It's close to a perfect subcompact camera. This camera is highly prized by many and the current selling price is more than the current model and more than I paid.

The small sensor means more noise but you get deeper depth of field, however it's harder to get an out of focus background.  The plus that helps offset this is the 2.0 lens but only at the wide end.  The small size means it's a lot more fiddly to use and handle.  It's slow.  Slow to focus, slow to shoot.

ITs small enough to carry in your pocket. I took it to a concert lounge and the HD movie quality is awesome! However a 7 minute HD video will eat up 1 GB of memory, so make sure you settle for nothing less than an 8 GB memory card. THe picture quality is superb and makes excellent prints. There is so much this little camera can do that it will take alot of time to figure out all its controls and features. The camera comes with:wrist strap, battery charger,  battery pack NB-6L, AV cable, usb interface cable, Canon software solution disc version 72.0.The battery life is rated at about 200 shots so make sure you top the battery off before you use it. One minor annoyance with this camera is when the flash is needed, it pops up unexpectedly where your left hand usually holds it in the corner.IT startles you a little, but nothing too worrisome as all PS cameras with pop up flash does this. YOu will also like the ring control feature where you can customize what feature you want for the ring control.There is no user manual included so you will have to write to Canon and they will mail you one if you request it. This camera also shoots excellent in low light conditions. The same goes with the HD video shooting. This is not an automatic PS camera so you will need to tweek certain operations although it does have a fully automatic mode if you like simplicity.My previous PS camera was a Canon SD1100IS and the S95 beats it hands down in every category! I cannot think of anything where the SD1100 shines over the S95.THe S95 does not have a vew finder but I never use those anyway on PS cameras. However one nice feature on the S95 is that the LSD screen shows you exacltly what the photo will look like before you take the picture. This is a nice  feature especially if you want to shoot in manual mode. MY DSLR camera does not even have this feature. The zoom is only 3.8X so this is not a super zoom lens. However it does have an aperature value of f2.0 to f8.0. THe MM equivalant of the S95 is 28-105 MM.Overall, if you know anything about manual controls, this camera should not be a problem with you.

I own the Canon SD450, Panasonic DMC-TZ5, and Casio EX-FC100 and I prefer slightly punchy way Canon's render color compared to other digital cameras.  10 megapixels on the S95 is plenty of megapixels and shots look very good at the pixel level so you have enough resolution for large prints.2) Spectacular low light capability compared to other compact cameras.  I usually leave the flash turned off because the shots turn out great without it.  In 3 megapixel low light mode you can snap hand held shots in the dark that you won't believe - the camera will see way more than your eyes can.  In dim light you can take good looking HD videos.  If I take the same low-light video shots with my Panasonic DMC-TZ5 they look dark and grainy.3) Great compact size.  Can put in any pocket no problem.4) GREAT lens design choice.  Fast 2.0 28 mm wide angle is wonderful.  3.8x zoom while somewhat limited, but keeps the camera size/weight low.  I'd MUCH rather have this lens than a lower aperture (slower) but longer zooming lens because I deal with low light WAY more often than I need 10x zoom.5) HD movies look great - though the slow 24 frame per second means you have to be careful about moving the camera as you shoot.6) Stereo sounds quality for movies is really good.  Camera does a good job auto-adjusting recording levels to give good sounding results.  I recorded a school concert and it sounds great in stereo.7) Looks good and finish texture makes it easy to hold on to8) Lots of controls - fun to play with.9) The flash is pretty strong for a compact camera if you want to use it.CONS1) Only digital zoom during movie shooting, no optical zoom either manual or powered.  Digital zoom of course makes the video look crappy so it's basically useless.2) No auto-focus during movie shooting.  Limits what you can do in a single clip.3) Manual zoom JUMPS from one focal length to another - you can't get in-between focal lengths.  Other controls like aperture also JUMP from one setting to the next.  I can't figure out why you'd have a huge manual control ring that could give you fantastic manual control, and then ruin it by making is so jumpy and discreet.  This makes the camera feel cheap.4) In movie mode in low light, camera JUMPS in brightness  - aperture doesn't smoothly change, it JUMPS is a very visible way.  Very distracting and annoying in the output video.5) Wrist strap doesn't have the adjustable ring to keep the camera tightly attached to your wrist.  This can't cost more than a penny - it's amazing a $366 camera is missing this obvious feature that will keep you from dropping this expensive camera.6) 24 frames/second video is pretty slow.  You have to be very slow about panning the camera to avoid poor looking jittery shots.  This camera really should have 30 fps or even 60 fps movie options.7) Ergonomics could be better.  I have pretty large hands, amazingly the designers have put the shutter button about 1/3 inch too far to the left to make this camera easily usable with just your right hand.  You have to STRETCH your index finger to reach the shutter button.  If you have small hands there's no way you could shoot with one hand!!  I guess I'll get used to it, but I've missed several shots because I'm pressing down where the shutter button isn't. This is a significant problem.8) Very minor issue: Holding the camera with 2 hands is also a little awkward - if you use the flash because the flash pops up under the most natural place to place your left index finger.  This is minor because I mostly leave the flash off and would rather shoot with one hand anyway.CONCLUSIONI'm a bit mystified how the Canon designers could get so many important features right with this camera, but screw up so many details that my 2 year old Panasonic TMZ-TZ5 managed to get right.  At $366 it's very disappointing to have so many shortcomings.  However,  what this camera does well, it does REALLY well so I'm going to hold on to it and overall I'm very happy with it.  If you need a really good compact camera now  - I'd definitely buy it.  No need to lug a large camera around because this small camera will handle 98% of your still shooting needs very well.  However, I sure hope the next version of this camera fixes the list of shortcomings, because this camera has the potential to be other-worldly fantastic when it's gets these issues fixed.

I own a G10 and liked it so much I bought this camera to compliment or replace it because the G10 is too bulky to fit in my pocket. I read the reviews and bought the S95. All was well for the first few months. Until the dreaded \"lens error\" occurred.When it happened I was in Thailand where I spend about half the year. The camera was only about 6 months old and therefore still under warranty. No problem, I thought. There's a Canon Service Center in Chiang Mai. I had used them before to remove a dust particle from the sensor of my G10. They did that for the very reasonable sum of $15 USD and I had the camera back the next day. I took my camera to the service center expecting a quick warranty repair, just as I received for a Toshiba LED TV and my Samsung laptop.Imagine my surprise when I learned that the Canon warranty is only valid in the country where the camera was purchased! The rep at the Service Center told me they could fix the camera but for a cost of almost $300! After a few emails with Canon Customer Service (hah! an egregious misnomer if ever there was one), I found out that not only were the Chiang Mai folks giving me accurate info about the in-country warranty but that even if I were willing to ship the unit back to Canon at my own, considerable, expense, Canon categorically would not accept shipments from a foreign country! Unbelievable but true.As I write this review, I'm back in the U.S. and the camera has been repaired under warranty. However, as if to reinforce my opinion about Canon's negligence in handling my issue from the start, they returned the camera to my home address instead of following explicit and bold-faced instructions in my cover letter to return it to my son's home in Oregon.Needless to say, that will be my last purchase of a Canon product.So, travelers beware. If you are under the impression that your warranty will cover your expensive investment while traveling outside of the U.S., you would be wrong. I was planning to sell my G10 and was glad I hadn't got around to doing that because I ended up needing a backup for the balance of my time in Thailand.

I'm happy to say that the dial is much improved, the surface has more grip, and it now offers HD video. However, some irks remain. The pop up flash resides exactly where your left index finger holds the camera and will sometimes jam if you hold the camera firmly. I complained that the NB-6L battery had a short life (about 220 shots) but in the S95 the battery life is even shorter (about 200 shots). My remaining complaint against the S90 was that because the F2.0 lens allowed for better low-light shooting, it often shot pictures without the flash in situation where it otherwise should have. This led to many noisy (grainy) pictures. It seems that the S95 has improved slightly in this department too.It's not perfect but for its size is a very admirable camera. I hope that the next version of the camera has a fixed flash and a grip. Even a small grip would help immensely, especially for people with large hands.

I usually take my video's at the most wide angle for which the physical focal length is just 6mm (which corresponds to 28mm of the film cameras) and therefore the depth of field is big enough to have things in focus most of the time, so it's again not a big problem.3) The real problem is the spontaneous flashing of the brightness of the entire screen when people you're taking picture of are moving in front of the camera. As every other video camera S95 constantly measures the brightness of the sceen and makes exposure adjustments. However while most of the other cameras I've been using now and before are doing that gradually (and I believe electronically), S95 uses its mechanical diaphragm by switching it withing a set of fixed appertures. When a person or some people are moving withing the frame the brightness of the sceen is changing gradually but the camera adjusts the exposure by doing sharp transitions from one fixed apperture to another which makes the entire screen flashing all of a sudden brighter and darker back and forth. If you're taking video in a very silent environment you can even hear on the footage some low-level clicks when the diaphragm is being adjusted.After doing some testing I've found that happens when a big subject (because it is big by itself or because it came much closer to the camera than the others) is moving into the central part of the sceen occupying more than 20-30% of the entire frame and the brightness of that subject is pretty much different than that of the entire sceen. For example, if in a relatively bright environment a person in a black clothes is coming pretty close to the camera and then either shifting out of the center of moving away from the camera.Unlike my other P&S; cameras this Canon S95 provided much better video quality in the low-light conditions but the flashing effect became a real deal breaker for me.", "Date": "October 8, 2010"}, {"Title": "Great camera", "Author": "R.

I know the spec's say it does a 28mm, but it does not do a good wide angle and does not even perform like the S80 in wide angle.I take my camera's out with me and take pictures. I wanted to take a couple of pictures of a Nissan dealership in Washington the other day, and the S95 was unable to get the complete bldg in the picture, or even half of the bldg., as did the HX5v and the S80. Am I going to sell the S95?,  No, I love this camera. The size, the picture quality, and the performance is great except for that issue. The video (HD)is not the best in the lot, but it's in the running, and plenty good enough for when I have it out.I really think that most of the complaints on point & shoots are from not knowing how to work the camera's though. Wide angle on the S95 is not a user issue though.For the money, the size, the performance, I would never get rid of the S95, unless I could only have one camera, which is not the case. The S95 runs close with the Panasonic LX5 in pic quality, except that the panasonic probably does wide angle just fine.  I've never been able to play with the panasonic. Other camera's of interest would be the Olympus XZ1 and the Nikon Coolpix P300. But they're alot bigger than the S95. I could easily own the canon SX230, which is the SX210 with HD video and GPS.

I ordered the S95 to replace a Canon PowerShot SD940. The S95 is a really nice looking little camera, with lots of creative features...more that just a \"point and shoot.\" I was excited to have a camera that was so small and easy to carry around, and that took high-quality images. I also purchased a Canon PSC-900 leather case to protect it when it was in my jacket pocket. But when I looked closely at the first images that I took, they just didn't seem very good. They were sharp in some spots, but out of focus in other areas. I looked through the owner's manual, and tried different settings, but no improvement.Too late to return to Amazon, so I sent it to Canon under warranty. The turn-around was amazingly fast. I had it back in about a week. The bad news though, was that the images were even worse than before. Sent back to Canon a second time, with same fast turn-around! This time, they got it right. The images were finally razor-sharp throughout the entire image. What a sweet little camera! My favorite to slip in my pocket when going out and doing stuff with family or friends.Fast forward about 18 months. Took the S95 to a family brunch get-together a few weeks ago. Took the camera out, turned it on, and nothing! Only the current time displayed in jumbo numbers on the back screen, with each number inside a square, and the squares would rotate as the time advanced. If I pressed the shutter button, the lens would suddenly pop out, and the image from the lens would appear on the screen. But none of the buttons worked, so no way to pull-up the menu or change settings. The zoom and auto focus worked, and if I press the shutter button it takes a picture, but again, only at the settings that are \"frozen\" since I can't get into the menu to change anything. No flash either. Basically now worthless as a camera. (But a cool desk clock!)What a let-down. The camera was kept in it's case since day-one, and looks like brand-new. It's never been dropped or wet or near a sandy beach or salty ocean air. Only took 1497 shots with it. Not worth paying $100+ to have it fixed, especially based on it's track record, as it would probably fail again.BTW, I gave my old PowerShot SD940 to my daughter in college, and it is still working flawlessly after almost 4 years and 1000's of shots...I should have stayed with that one!", "Date": "April 16, 2014"}, {"Title": "Great Camera", "Author": "Sam Randol", "ReviewID": "R2SJHEHCIYZDMM", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I love this camera.

The pictures are great and the videos are phenomenal when there is plenty of light around.  Good solid high-end compact point-and-shoot.The only issue I have with it is that if you start a video before this focuses it will stay out of focus the whole time. Not sure why.  Oh also sometimes it will start up and say the battery needs replacing even if the battery is brand new.  If you go to view pictures instead the message goes away and then you can half-press the shutter and it will work just fine.  Looks like the detection of battery level when you start it up is buggy.

I am just starting to get into photography so it allows me to gradually go into more of the manual modes.

Apparently this is the only error message that the camera will give you, so it doesn't mean that there is a specific defect that one can ascertain when receiving this message.  At least that is what the tech for Canon told me.  Just know that it means you can't fix it by yourself.  The positive is that the people at Canon were amazing!  I called the customer service line, and they immediately gave me the information I needed.  They asked for my address and told me where the closest center for canon was to send my camera in and have it fixed. I received the camera back in approximately 10 days.  It works great once again.  I was still covered under warranty, and I would have been so mad if it had happened 6 month from now. I'm crossing my fingers that everything is okay now.

All I have to say, is that canon should just eliminate most of the auto functions such as the various scenes like underwater, low light, tilt shift etc and just leave the Full manual control along with the auto focus.

Its like a SLR without the zoom and the size. I never use the auto features, except the auto focus. If you want HDR Photos, all you need is a tripod and Photomatrix. The HDR auto function on this camera is a joke. It reduces the image to a 2.5MB JPEG file and it only takes three shots in different exposure which is very limiting. I only use the manual setting with the auto focus, auto tracking, focus lock, and occasionally, the AI servo feature. 10MPix is more than enough for prints, the 28mm lens is not so much a problem, because I always runs my photos through Photoshop before making a print and photo-stitch along with lens correction sometimes fixes the wide angle issue. And as you know, Photoshop can recreate all the auto scene effects that are produced with this camera and I see no reason to load it in because I never made a direct print from camera to printer without doing some photo corrections.Besides having the auto mode, its not a loss and still remains a top notch slim down camera with an SLR power.", "Date": "August 15, 2011"}, {"Title": "Great camera for its size and price", "Author": "MattA", "ReviewID": "R1HJT9REB482LB", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This is a great camera.

Clearly these are very different products, but the s95, or other cameras like it, can potentially provide a useful secondary camera for someone not wanting to lug a 5d and its lenses around all day long.I own a 5d Mark II and a number of L lenses, and was looking for a secondary camera, especially one that was portable, yet offered high image quality.  My challenge is that i'm very picky on image quality, and my initial inclination was that I'd suck it up and continue to use the 5d if I could not get reasonable quality from the s95 or a similar product.  I know the image quality will be vastly different, but the question is whether all things considered (portability, image quality, etc.), would I be happy using the s95 as a backup, or would it severely disappoint me.I took the plunge and bought a S95.  In short, I'm happy, but not ecstatic.  Obviously, there's a big difference in image quality, but its not as big as I expected.  If used in the right conditions (good lighting, artificial or otherwise) with a low ISO setting (400 and under), you'll be very happy with the results.  It may not be appropriate for poster size, but would work well up to 8X10.Video - it does shoot video, and perhaps HD according to some measures.  However, the quality is so so.  This is in comparison with my companion Canon Vixia S100.  Again, unfair to the S95 to make this comparison, but footage is very noisy.  All else seems fine, but the noise is unavoidably there.  Also, unlike conventional camcorders, the S95 does not continuously auto focus on the subject; you have to be very careful to ensure your subject stays within the focus plane.General - if you're a dSLR user, you would buy this camera as a easily portable option.  The size is great, it easily fits in a pant pocket, and you certainly don't experience fatigue by carrying it all day, as you clearly do with a 5d.  You definitely will not see 5d-like image quality, but you will produce extremely usable shots.  Someone once said the best shots are the ones you actually get.  I take that insight to heart, and find myself capturing many more images with this than my 5d simply because its easy to do so.  My 5d is glorious, but the s95 is always there ready to do.Again, my point was to determine whether I could live with the s95 as a backup to my 5d, not to replace my 5d.  Given the pretty decent image quality and superb portability, the answer is yes.Also, i'm rating this a 4/5.  It would be higher if the video quality were stronger.  Irrespective of any comparison to an equally priced or higher product, the video definitely lags.

Nope, 6 months after its \"repair\" it did it again, conveniently AFTER the repair warranty. Huge bummer and lesson learned I suppose.

So between the lens error reading and the fact that its unable to focus most times, its a huge pain and unreliable now for our vacations and stuff like that. And im not paying for a 2nd repair. So I'm basically hanging on till it dies and then that's that. For the money AND the cost of the repair I would have expected it to last longer. I love cannon, and while it took great pictures/videos for the time it DID work, this experience has left me with a sour taste and that's the reason for the 1 star.

This little camera takes pictures that are almost SLR quality. Low light performance is excellent as are focusing speed and accuracy. It also has almost instant startup and almost no shutter delay, it even has a usable 2 FPS frame rate! Although it has an almost SLR like menu of options and adjustable parameters including full manual mode, etc, this are really more for show since the camera's small form factor and controls make it difficult to run it in modes other than full auto and the preset scene modes. That said, its amazing that they are available at all and they work well! Its zooming range is small but the lens works very well throught its range. It has none of the terrible pincushioning and chromatic aberrations of long zoom compact cameras. Even the video mode is well executed and tkes very good 720p video! In its default settings it does try to make up for its inherent limitations by producing slighty oversaturated colors, however, this is easily corrected in the color settings. Its main shortcommings are associated to ergonomics, its simply a small box, thus it doesnt have any real handgrip, its buttons are tiny, and the controls for adjusting its comprehensive manual parameters are the barrel and the small rear control rings making them unconventional and a little hard to use. Also caveat emptor: the camera is fragile while the lens is open. Our daughter \"killed\" hers when she dropped it onto a hard surface. All in all, the proof is in the pudding, this its a very small form factor camera that takes excellent pictures even in low light conditions and suffers from none of the usual performnce compromises of compact cameras, it even offers the option of creative photography if you are willing to mess around with its small controls. Only more expensive digital SLRs produce consistently better quality photography and that is probably only noticeable to the critical eye. For a 400 dollar, snapshot size, take anywhere camera, that is high praise indeed. Nikon should be taking notes :)PS: I like it so much I even bought the excellent, full function underwater case for our trip to the caribbean!An update on an otherwise great camera. The S series has proven quite fragile in my expirience. My original S90 died after a drop of around 4 feet onto a fiberglass surface. Our S95 developed battery door issues so it stopped working.

I took an accidental shot of my dog in Program mode at ISO 1600 and it had very little noise and wonderful shadow detail.  The fine tuning white balance was better than my Pentax K1000D, which is mouldering in a vault because I can't stand to carry it around. :(  The manual control ring, short cut button and Custom modes are a necessity.Beautiful shallow depth of field even outdoors in rainy light (ISO 80, 1/13 sec, f/4.5).  I did a straight shot of some trees and the near branches were out of focus while the far trees were dead on.  I had to contort myself with the macro feature in my A710 to get a similar effect.The bad news:  HORRIBLE battery life.  I don't like proprietary batteries to begin with.  I actually wished the thing were a bit bigger, say the size of my old A710, which this is replacing because the latter's lens finally cracked, to maybe accommodate enough AAs to power it, but oh well.  I think I got 80 pictures out of it before the battery died.  If I hadn't a spare I would have been in a bad way.  Will have to get another spare one.The other bad news:  continuous focus is slower than molasses and blurs every third shot.  I haven't tried the focus tracking yet.I'd like to see more flexibility as to what can be displayed on the screen.  I had to go with a basic vanilla empty version because it had too much information on it for me to see.  The live histogram is nice.I'm too poor to upgrade to Photoshop CS5, 6 whatever it is now, so I had to use the Canon software to process the RAW files. It's actually fairly good but crashes intermittently.  I did convert the RAW files to DNGs with the Adobe DNG converter to save.  I wish the Canon software had a DNG option instead of disk space gobbling TIFFs.I was also impressed with the icontrast (increase shadow detail) feature.  A lazy bum could get away with using icontrast on JPEGs in lieu of processing RAW in certain instances.

I had been very happy with the Minox 35 EL and ML and was hoping for something similar.

The inventory pictures I took after Hurricane Sandy were very good, but I suddenly got the infamous Canon S95 lens error restart message. So much for carrying the camera in a case in my front jeans pocket. I think an inherent flaw in the design is the motorized zoom lens assembly. The Minox lens came out manually when you opened the lens cover and the Olympus was all internal movement protected by the water resistant design.If you like this kind of camera and don't want to be disappointed then you better buy two models to use one as a backup when the primary fails. That makes the price prohibitive and complicates carrying the cameras. You could use your cell phone as a backup, but then why buy this camera in the first place?

The picture quality is amazing and everyone knows that, that is not why I am here to review this little guy. Video is one main selling points for me as I like to shoot when interesting things happen around me when I am never expecting it. The portability and the HD video seemed like this camera would be a match made in heaven for me. But, the video issues ended up being the deal breakers for me. I knew of the problems before purchasing the S95, but I did not realize how much of an issue it was. I have several older P&S; models that can AF and optically zoom while shooting, why can't Canon figure this out? It's almost like that just want to save something for next year's model so people will have reason toupgrade.Also the macro is not on par with even budget P&Ss;, I have to be at least 5cm away to focus in on very small objects. This seems like a minor gripe, but I love to shoot macro. I have taken hundreds of photos with this camera and I just cannot get as close as I would like.So I kept looking around for other options and I think the LX5 has all of the things that I have complaints with from the S95, so I purchased it and it should be here in a couple days right before I leave for the Bahamas. I will do extensive testing comparing both models for my needs. I really am in love with the portability of the S95 and I see myself taking it out more and getting greater photo ops than I would with my larger cameras. I know that the LX5 is $100 more expensive, but when already dropping $40, another $100 isn't going to make a huge difference over the few years I plan on owning it.I will update when I get back from vacation and make my decision on which camera has won me over.", "Date": "October 10, 2010"}, {"Title": "No Brainer Camers", "Author": "Jerry W.

Its strengths are the economical size coupled with rich capability -- IMO it's as close as one can come to an SLR as possible without the bulk.  The SD800IS has been with me for many years, many outdoor adventures, and has captured many great pictures with no problems.  It still works well and I intend to keep using it, but we needed a second camera.The S95 seemed a suitable equal and now that I've had a chance to play with it, it's obviously a great device.  For the same price as I paid for the SD800IS many years ago, we now have an S95 with not only more capability to control image capture -- nearly full manual control of focus, aperture and exposure -- but a far superior ability to take low light pictures.  (as well as some other neat stuff with high appeal to the more casual photographer)There is one major omission to the camera's features, and it baffles me as to why Canon didn't program this into the S95.  There doesn't seem to be what they call a \"digital macro\" setting; that is, a setting that allows extremely close-up photos.  On the SD800IS, I can slip the camera into digital macro mode and take pictures of amazing things I can never see with my naked eye.  For example, I've captured rock crystals, fabric threads, lichen leaves, dew drops, leaf hair, and pin-head sized bugs far better than any other point-and-shoot camera I've ever owned.  Great fun!  Probably 20% of my photos with the SD800IS used digital macro.Not so on the S95.  Yes, using the S95's regular macro mode and then zooming the pictures in a photoshop program will probably achieve similar results -- given the S95's quality lens and sensor -- but it's really not the same as having the ability to see how the picture is framed and focused in the moment you take it.Canon, I'm a loyal consumer, but if you don't offer digital macro, I'm going to have to find another company.Another thing.  One reviewer complained about the flash popping up, hitting his finger, getting stuck, and then he has to restart the camera each time this happens.  This happened to me too, but repeated restarts did not clear the error.  I had to first push the flash down into the body, then it restarted OK.  Ick.  This seems pretty clunky; there must be a better way to handle this.  However, I'm not going to return the camera for this, simply because we don't like taking photos with the flash anyway -- and thank goodness for it's low light prowess!Lastly, we ordered a PSC-3200 case for this camera and it fits OK.", "Date": "January 9, 2011"}, {"Title": "Best compact camera yet", "Author": "Tom", "ReviewID": "R2ODU0UVWEBAG0", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This is the best compact camera I've bought yet.

I previously just used my iPhone 4's camera but read extensively about using manual controls before purchasing the s95, so I really looked forward to the manual mode. I ended up using the manual mode for almost all of my shots. I usually set it to ISO on the front and aperture/shutter time on the back, and 90% of the time, the aperture is set to largest (F2) to minimize shutter time and ISO. I wish I had known how the custom mode worked before my trip. You can set whatever settings you want and then go into the menu, click up once to get to the bottom of the menu options for \"Save settings\" and all your current settings, including the shooting mode go into Custom. I found the auto-WB to be pretty awful, so I had to set the shortcut button to the WB control. Fortunately, the auto-WB is acceptable in full AUTO mode. I wish there was a faster way to switch to AUTO mode temporarily. When I handed the camera to someone else to let them take a photo of me, it was usually set correctly if I had just been playing with it but sometimes it would be a bit dark or light, and it would be too much work to explain how to change the manual settings. I ended up just setting it to AUTO most of the time before handing it to someone else. I don't quite understand when I would use the other three modes (Aperture priority, shutter priority, and Program), and I wish I could just treat those three modes like three more Custom modes with full-auto control that remember their own settings.Overall, this is a great camera with awesome IQ and pretty intuitive controls for a budding enthusiast. I'm going to give it five stars because I got it during the Gold-box special for an insane price. Pretty much everything works fine. I didn't even have to swap batteries (took ~150 shots over 3 days but charged up every night) and the transfer process is dummy-proof using my macbook air and iPhoto (although iPhoto doesn't start up on its own when I plug in the camera but this might be a setting on my computer). I also do wish it had GPS, but I don't think built-in GPS is what I want. My iPhone has such rapid and accurate GPS acquisition since it also uses WIFI and cell towers to locate itself that I wish the camera could talk to the iPhone for GPS location.

I love Canon products but cannot recommend the S95 because of it's price and limitations.

For stills, the low light capabilities of this camera are quite good, yet some of the images are blurred, so it's not great. My biggest complaint with this camera is it's too slow, there's a lag between shots which is simply unacceptable. I take a lot of photos and half of my shots are missed.

For those of us who understand how to use manual operation this means that even if you can control the f Stop and shutter speed separately, you will have no way of knowing if you exposure is correct.  So, it is almost impossible to use manual mode and alter the depth of field or do any kind of exposure variations.  Canon confirmed this.(2) This camera's highest F stop is f5.6 in telephoto and f8 in wide.  This seriously limits your ability to gain long distance depth of field, so landscape photography or travel pics in which you want a large area to be in focus are out of the question.  It basically works within the same range that a point and shoot camera works; at 3 to 4 times the price.(3) The operating manual is almost useless.  It is nothing but an exercise in putting in the battery, turning it on and snapping a picture.  It has almost no instructions about mode variations and nothing on the use of manual mode (now I know why).  I spent hours working through the menus and was still having trouble using it.  I got so frustrated that I called Canon; their tech support person couldn't explain it's use and had to get a supervisor to tell me that I was correct about points 1 and 2 above.(4) The zoom lever (at least on the one I received) is not smooth at all; it zooms too fast and sometimes it is slow to start.  This causes a bunch of back and forth zooming to get the composition that you want.  I realize that this is a compact camera but most of the controls are hard to manipulate and I have small hands.(5) It has no viewfinder.  For some this will not be a problem but for me; I like looking through a viewfinder not an LCD screen.This camera has serious limitations. I didn't expect it to be the same as my SLR but it does not even come close to an SLRs manual operation and for $425, and the way Canon promotes it, it should.If you understand how to use a camera in manual mode,coupled with a light meter and this is how you want to use this camera, you will be very disappointed.

I have a Rebel, but purchased this S96 to replace my trusty SD800 (that I've had for YEARS).Out of the box, I was highly disappointed.  The camera has a VERY cheap feel to it, and there wasn't even a basic memory card with which to test out the camera.  Luckily, I always have an extra one in my purse, so I popped it in and set to work.Clarity is impressive (most important part, right?).  The photos seem crisp and the colors are true.  The menu options (as many other posters have opined) really are quite intuitive.  I wasn't so happy about the facial recognition, though, as it has failed to pick up on a face or two that should have been glaringly obvious.I dunno... I have to admit being worried about the durability of this camera.  The shell seems to be so... cheap.  I don't spike my cameras onto concrete, but considering I've got a toddler, my cameras certainly take their bumps.  I sincerely hope this one is up to the task of providing exceptional pictures while enduring the occasional bump to the case.Update:  Two of the pixels were burned out and had to send back to Amazon for replacement.  Amazon's service is AMAZING!  In the meantime, tested out the camera some more and here's what I've got:Movie quality - Impressive.  Sound quality leaves something to be desired if you're not incredibly close to the camera, but the video quality itself is astounding.  Even up on a big-screen, playback is incredible.  It rivals my hand-held Mini DV.  I am absolutely floored by the clarity and smoothness of this function!Flash - works well if a little slow at times.  Remember if you're using auto to make sure the flash is already up and out of the camera before attempting to do your work!  It takes time to slide itself out of the case.Exposure - you can change this pretty quickly if you're into it.  Otherwise, stick with auto which also works spot-on.Red-eye Reduction - doesn't seem to work as well as my Canon SD800.  That surprised me a bit, and I'm wondering if that had anything to do with the particular camera I got.  I'll be double checking this when the new one comes in.ISO - Where's the ISO button???  No ISO button makes me a sad, sad photographer.  Also no selectable auto-focus point.  That made me bummed, too.Outside \"shell\" or casing - I'm still not happy about this, because it honestly feels very cheap.Still, picture clarity is downright gorgeous.

The pop-up flash is completely unnerving, as it pops up right where you hold the camera, and puts me on edge when I use it -- instead of concentrating on the shot, I concentrate on making sure I'm very delicately holding the camera away from the flash.  Even then it still gets me and I jerk, often messing up the picture.  The other thing I completely don't understand is the included strap.  The S95, like the SD970, come with a strap that doesn't have the slider clip to keep it securely on your wrist, so the camera just falls right off, and I had to re-use the normal one from the SD850.", "Date": "November 12, 2011"}, {"Title": "customer service", "Author": "Matthieu Ivan Pierre", "ReviewID": "R3TZU376ZL6BTS", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "Canon's customer service are totally useless ! and this camera is to slow, bad bad bad bad bad bad bad", "Date": "December 25, 2012"}, {"Title": "No Video", "Author": "Peter H.

For lack of better words and technical terms about photography, my wife and I just know that this camera does not take good photos when there is unbalanced light in the background under auto mode. We were looking for a camera that takes good pictures under auto mode because my wife is not very technical. This camera just brought frustration and cost us $60 in restocking fee at BestBuy. We ended up buying a Nikon Coolpix S8100 camera which is $100 cheaper and performs better. I am writing this review not hating Canon, I have used other Canon camera, I just want others to know that there are other options other than this camera. It does not perform well under the auto mode. You might have to play around with settings that applies to the photo that you need to take.

Low Light is better than Panasonic but still poorer than a 3 year old DSLR.This camera is good in all ways except the pictures are ordinary/mediocre. If you think you will get magical pictures...forget it. Its okay. But not good enough for $400. Just get a used DSLR for under $300 and those $120 cameras for those portable needs.Don't expect money to beat the laws of physics...for Low Light pics and moving subjects you need a big area to capture light. At day light most compacts including this will do decently.Update:There seems to be a cult of Canon S90/S95. Next time I would stay away from Over Hyped products. I just bought a Nikon Dslr. I took 300 pics, in just auto and scene modes. No fiddling with the settings. The pics just came out magical. And the DSLR just cost me 100 more than the current price of this mediocre Canon.

I made it clear that this \"was\" the camera I've chosen to be my P&S;, but they replied with an email stating that they were not going to send anymore replacements.
