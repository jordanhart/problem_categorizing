I'm thinking..Intro:I have had my Canon 5D Mark II for a little over two weeks now. And I'm having a hard time putting it down.I tried switching back to my Canon 40D and the very first thing you notice is how small, dim and fuzzy the viewfinder on the 40D is compared to the 5D Mark II. Especially if you are older you will really appreciate being able to easy see and read information in the viewfinder not to mention you can actually manually focus with it. It reminds me of my switch from the Canon Rebel XTi to the 40D. It's that big a difference.The Images are huge and quite simply stunning. Plus I find that I can get away with very low noise all the way up to 3200 ISO on the 5D Mark II where the 40D was very noisy. In fact I would not hesitate to say the 5D Mark II photos has less noise at 9,600 ISO then the 40D does at 1600 ISO.Lenses:I have never had the pleasure of owning a Camera that is this demanding of the lens you use. It's like an instant lens test. I haven't seen much in-depth lens as used on 5D Mark II information on the other reviews and decided this would be good to be included in my review.All of these lenses are brighter in the viewfinder and focus much better on my 5D Mark II then on my 40D.So, with that said after several hundred photos I can give you a rundown of my most used, most favorite, best performing and least used lenses that I have used on the 5D Mark II and a few un-expected surprises along the way.1.  Canon 200mm F/2 IS L lens.  This lens is my new master of resolving power.  Even wide open at F/2 it is sharper then any other lens I have ever used.  I could go on and on but here's a few highlights: Lightening fast auto focus, F/2 speed at 200mm, unbelievable perfect 10 Images, public attention hog, otherworldly image stabilization, great build quality, weather sealed, fantastic perfect buttery smooth Bokeh and what a lens case!  If you crave attention and demand the absolute best there is the do what ever it takes to get this lens on your Canon 5D Mark II.  If you do not like public attention you may want to skip to number 2 in this list as I have never been asked so many questions about a lens as this one.  But it's all worth it as the clarity, sharpness, Bokeh and colors are: otherworldly, insane, impossible, rare, perfect, out of sight, crazy!!2. Canon 85mm F/1.2 II L lens. Without a doubt at F/4 (after the Canon 200mm F/2 of course) this lens delivers the clearest sharpest and most resolving power onto any photograph you care to take with the Canon 5D Mark II. The clarity has to be seen to be believed. At F/1.2 the Depth of Field (DOF) is scary thin and the edges are super soft which is great for female portraiture. The super soft creamy dreamy Bokeh at F/1.2 is much smoother on the 5D Mark II over my 40D. But stop this lens down to F/1.8 and it gets scary sharp and clear.  Step it down to F/4.0 and it's at its sharpest and the only lens I have that gives you 100% pixel peeping razor blade edge to edge top to bottom perfect clarity in every single area of the photo.  For some reason this lens is even sharper on my 5D Mark II then my 40D or Rebel, don't know why but it is. Guess it's getting the full resolving power to the 21 megapixel sensor.Looking at a photo on my iMac taken with a 5D Mark II with this lens stopped down to F/4 is like standing there looking through an open window at the actual scene!  You feel like you could actually open up the computer screen like opening a window and climb in!!!The 85mm F/1.2 is your low light monster on the 5D Mark II, I don't have to harp too much on what an F/1.2 aperture and an ISO 25,600 can do for you at night. Let's just say you can go out into what appears to be a dark night and do hand held photos.Not all is perfect as it's: expensive, heavy, and hard to focus wide open, focus lock does not work and it eats camera batteries at twice the rate of my other lenses.  Also it doesn't focus as close on the 5D Mark II as it did on my 40D so you can't get head filling close ups.  This isn't really a problem, as with 21 Mega Pixels I can crop no problem.  However, all this is forgiven when I get back to my iMac and view the results. This is the very first lens I will reach for when using the 5D Mark II and the one that's on it 90% of the time.  If I could have just one lens for a Canon 5D Mark II this would be the one!  [...]2. Tie! Canon 135mm F/2 L.  It's small light and stealthy and has fastest and best auto-focus of any lens I have ever owned (after the Canon 200mm F/2 IS L).  It even focuses pretty close on the 5D Mark II.  This lens is amazing, the Bokeh looks like sweet candy and it's sharper wide open then the Canon 85mm F/1.2 II L lens is wide open and stop it down to F/2.2 and it's as sharp as any lens I have. It's not a zoom so it's not as versatile but it's a great waist up portrait lens out in public and in larger studios.  It's one of my most used lens at outdoor public events along with the 85mm F/1.2 II L (renaissance festivals etc.) where I'm photographing people.  For some reason this lens is a little sharper on my Canon Rebel and 40D I guess because I'm using the center of the lens and it's sharper on these cropped sensor cameras.3. Canon 100-400 F/4.5 - F/5.6 IS L lens. This is the second most used lens in my 5D Mark II arsenal. This lens was my biggest surprise of the group.  Its Ok wide open but it's a monster of clarity at F/7.1 like it never was on my Canon 40D. It also becomes useable on the 5D Mark II in wider shot situations where on the 40D it was only usable as a longer lens. Sporting the longest zoom range of any Canon zoom this lens has to be without doubt the finest Zoo lens ever made, [...] You can frame almost any animal in almost any exhibit perfectly.  This is also my lens of choice for taking photos of people at events with the 5D Mark II and is the King of versatility on a full-framed sensor camera. This is my sharpest and clearest zoom lens by a long shot (no pun intended. It's as close to the you are there feeling of the 85mm F/1.2 lI lens as any zoom lens I have.  It's only drawbacks are it's a little heavy, is slow aperture wise (that's Ok with the 5D Mark II high ISO capability) and it gets a huge amount of attention out in public.  I don't care it's all worth it this is a must have lens with the 5D Mark II.  Again, for some reason this lens is even sharper on my 5D Mark II then my 40D or Rebel, don't know why but it is.5-26-2009 100-400 update:  So I came back from the Riparian Bird Preserve yesterday where it was rather dusty and I noticed that my sensor and mirror box were full of dust.  I decided to do a test on my 100-400 lens and sure enough it does pump dust into the camera body.If you turn the zoom friction ring all the way loose and zoom in and out with the bottom end cap off there is no resistance.  If you put the bottom end cap on tightly and zoom you can feel resistance.  Then if you loosen the end cap just a little you can actually feel air being sucked in and out around the end cap as you zoom in and out.Thank God for my FIrefly digital sensor cleaning system!  And be forewarned if you own this lens.4. Canon 17-40 F/4 L lens. This is my sleeper lens. A so so walk around lens on my 40D becomes a wide angle monster on my Canon 5D Mark II. This lens is soft wide open at F/4 but sharpens up noticeably at F/4.5 and becomes a super wide angle take it all in landscape and interior monster when stopped down to F/9 on a Canon 5D Mark II. This is a lens I always carry with me now since I never know when I might see a wide angle opportunity. Doesn't have the you are there feeling when viewing the photos on my iMac as much as the above three lenses but it's closer to perfection then you will ever see on a cropped sensor camera. I keep hoping that Canon will make a wide angle zoom that matches the performance of my Canon 100-400 IS L zoom lens.  This lens has a similar sharpness on both the Canon 5D Mark II and cropped sensor cameras like my 40D.5. Canon 70-200 F/2.8 L lens. This lens is actually about even with my Canon 100-400 IS L Lens in the zoom sharpness and clarity department but it's no where near as versatile on my 5D Mark II as the 100-400. Still it's a must have lens when shooting weddings when you need the super Bokeh background melting power of an F/2.8 aperture and lower light power of an F/2.8 aperture. The sharpness and clarity at F/2.8 that was Ok on the 40D is much improved for some strange reason on the 5D Mark II.  And the Bokeh is much smoother creamier and richer on the 5D Mark II.Just have to mention a great alternative lens the Canon 70-200 F/4 I/S L lens which I think is a sharper and better lens then the 70-200 F/2.8 as not only does it have a fluorite element but I did some back to back testing with my friends F/4 and my F/2.8 and the 70-200 F/4 was indeed better and at a great price.  Additionally it's much lighter in weight and smaller physically.  However keep in mind at F/4 it is a slower lens.6. Canon 24-70 F/2.8 L lens. This is the lens I reach for when I'm shooting closer photos at a wedding and I need the versatility of a zoom.  It's also the lens I reach for when shooting videos with the 5D Mark II.  If I could shoot all day with the Canon 85mm F/1.2 II L I would.  But at a wedding where you can't always zoom with your feet I reach for the Canon 24-70 F/2.8 L. Its good on the 5D Mark II but not as good as the 17-40 L but has better reach then the 17-40. But it does not have that uncanny you are there feel of the first three lenses on my list. The Canon 5D Mark II clearly out resolves this lens and that is very disappointing for an L lens that costs over a thousand dollars.  Thank GOD for the auto peripheral as this lens is a Vignetting monster when shot wide open on a 5D Mark II, it was not on the 40D. With the Vignetting control built into Digital Photo Professional (DPP) and the on-board 5D Mark II auto control it's perfect and Vignetting is not a problem. This lens is also very fragile and has required sending back to Canon for recalibration but is a must have in my arsenal only because I do weddings. I'm hoping Canon will come out with an Image Stabilized improved version that has that you are there feel of the 100-400 zoom.  Once again it seems like this lens may be losing it's calibration and I am starting to lose my patience.  If you need this lens then get it just beware of possible maintenance problems.7. Canon 50mm F/1.8 II lens. This lens which was pretty decent on the 40D and Rebel XTi comes completely apart on the 5D Mark II. No surprise since it's only $89. I guess the surprise was how well it had worked on a Canon 40D and Rebel XTi.  If you own a 5D Mark II then don't bother.  If you own a cropped sensor camera its a great little lens.8. Canon 17-50mm F/2.8 EF-S L lens. Why am I mentioning this lens here? It's a shame this cropped sensor only lens can't be used on the 5D Mark II. It's one of my most used and sharpest lenses on my Canon 40D and Canon Rebel XTi. In fact it's my daughter's favorite lens on those two cameras. Because it's such a great sharp low light monster because of the Image Stabilization (IS) it would be fantastic on the 5D Mark II. Canon please make us a wide angle L lens with IS.  It's been very reliable un-like my 24-70, I highly recommend if you have a cropped sensor camera!9.  Canon 15mm Fisheye!  This lens is a hoot on the 5D Mark II.  A full 180 degrees of wide angle fun!  Put it on and shoot the inside of a small car, or airplane, or take it to your local baseball diamond or anywhere you would love to see a 180 degree shot.  And the curved effect on a full frame camera makes everyone who sees one of these photos go oooohhhhhh yeah cool shot.  I listed this lens last because its one of those lenses you  don't want to over use but one that you just have to just have to have.  It's pretty sharp wide open but gets sharper at F/4 and reaches maximum sharpness at F/8.  It has the old style focus system that's a little noisy and slow but it really doesn't matter as there isn't much focus range anyway everything is close to infocus at 15mm.Three old 5D complaints answered:1. Vignetting or peripheral lighting issue2. Dust on the sensor3. The rear LCD1. Vignetting:You can either have the 5D Mark II auto-correct peripheral illumination on board for JPEGs or adjust images using Canon's Digital Photo Professional (DPP) software that came with your Mark II. I have noticed on the full framed 5D Mark II my Canon 24-70 F/2.8 L lens with the peripheral illumination correction turned OFF the 5D Mark II images will severely vignette or be dark in the corners when shot wide open (F/2.8). It's almost like looking through a dark tunnel. It's especially noticeable shot wide open with the sky as a background. Auto-correct to the rescue!! With the peripheral illumination correction turned ON it's almost magical the darkening in the corners is gone! If you want you can even shoot in Raw mode and adjust the amount of Vignetting or darkness in the corners for effects such as when shooting portraits and you want to emphasis the person in the middle of the photo. Just open the Raw photo in DPP and click on the NR/Lens / ALO tab and select Lens Aberration Correction Tune and adjust the peripheral illumination to suite by dragging the slider or entering and amount. Or select all the photos in a directory and you can correct all your photos at once.2. Dust on the Sensor:The old 5D was a dust hog, no-one ever said it was not. The new one though now as a new fluorite coating and ant-dust shake. I did get some dust on my sensor after going out and switching lens in the field shooting birds but un-like my 40D I successfully blew off all the dust using my Firefly Digital Dust sensor cleaner. This new fluorite coating must make it much harder for the dust to stick to the 5D Mark II sensor then the sensor on my 40D.3. Rear LCDThis has to be seen to be believed. The rear LCD is so sharp and so bright its shocking. The one on the 40D is now just OK. And I could never be sure if I got the shot or not. On the 5D Mark II you can zoom in an check fine focus. The only thing you may want to turn off is the auto light level adjuster so when walking in and out of shaded areas the brightness level does not change when the ambient light levels change. Some people may like it some may hate it. I like it myself as I can now see the image out in the sunlight unlike on the 40D where it's totally washed out. Thing is Canon lets you decide and you can turn it on or off. When off it stays the same no matter the ambient light.LOW ISO:Holy cow 6400 ISO I can shoot at F/4.5 in a dark room!!!! Took some night shots in and outside of the house and downloaded. Booted up DPP and WOW!Photos are great at 3200 ISO even in Raw mode with standard noise reduction. Once you apply the correct amount of noise reduction and converted to 17inch JPEG's the 3200 ISO photos are AWESOME!!! The night shots of my Christmas tree at 3200 ISO on my 40D are almost unusable. But with the 5D Mark II they are fantastic. But my 24inch iMac seems a little slower looking through the photos... In fact it seems to be crawling! I ended up having to upgrade to a Firewire 800 external hard drive to fix the problem.Black Dots:I finally got a single photo with black dots by shooting at 25,600 ISO at night around some Christmas lights. You have to zoom in to 200% and pixel peep to see them. That's one shot out of several hundred night shots! Still haven't found any dots in day time photos.Memory Storage:I'm going to have to buy larger Compact Flash Cards my 8GB card only holds about 267 shots when the 5D Mark II is set to Raw only. But it's worth it especially for high ISO shots. At times I'm hard pressed on-screen to tell 1600 ISO from the 5D Mark II to the 100 ISO out of my 40D. It's that GOOD!Video:I for one never thought I would be in this love for video. But this camera is awesome, low natural light great Bokeh low depth of field video. Just in time for the holidays. The only thing is after viewing the videos back on my iMac computer no matter how steady you hands are you will need a tripod. The tiniest movements when playing back on a computer or TV seem to be magnified no matter how steady I try and hand hold the camera.40D to 5D Mark II transition:Well, it looks a lot like my Canon 40D but the controls on the back are on the left instead of the bottom.Has a similar feel and weight to me at least maybe just a touch bigger and heavier then a 40D. Focus is better in low light for sure. Looks great with a Canon 17-40 F/4 L lens mounted. Maybe a little more rubbery grip on the grip.This will be a much easier transition coming from the Canon 40D to the Canon 5D Mark II then my transition from the Rebel XTi to the 40D as the control placement and use are very similar unlike when I switched from the Rebel to the 40D and everything was in a different location.Setup:Put the strap on while I'm waiting for the dead battery to charge.Ok battery is charged now, put it in, turn it on and set the time and date.Then plug into the Mac and set my preferences under the styles and choose my lenses under the peripheral illumination correction. Very nice and very easy.Put in the owners Information and copyright info. Gotta love that it's automatically on every photo now!Menus:Menus are a little different, but hey they are much sharper, this LCD is really sharp and bright!!!Who the heck put 10 images as the default for skipping on review!!! That's another one of the first changes to go!Bottom line:Bottom line is if you own a big L lens collection and do any shooting at all in the dark without flash and don't have a full framed camera the 5D Mark II is a must have addition!1-11-2009 Update:I installed firmware update 1.0.7 which is supposed to correct the black dot problem and now I can't get it to make a black dot photo at all.  So hopefully this was the fix we were all seeking.This full framed sensor camera continues to impress me and the sensor continues to be dust free!4-1-2009 Update:This full framed sensor camera continues to impress.  Just got back from shooting the 2009 Arizona Renaissance festival where I shot both the 40D and 5D Mark II and looking at the photos the 5D Mark II just walks all over the 40D in image quality.  So much so that I don't reach for the 40D much any more the 5D Mark II is that much better.  Got one spec of dust from lens changing at the Renaissance but it was easily blow off with my FireFly sensor cleaner.4-27-2009 I just got back from photographing the World Premiere of X-Men Origins: Wolverine and once again the 5D Mark II was awesome.  I ended up mainly using two lenses the Canon 24-70 F/2.8 L zoom and Canon 100-400 IS L zoom lens.  When you have only one chance to get Hugh Jackman  riding by on his Harley you want to make sure you have reliable quick focusing equipment.6-25-2009Still very in love with my Canon 5D Mark II.

I have been a photographer in one form or another for nearly 20 years.  I decided that I definitely wanted to go digital, but was not happy with any of the cropped sensor bodies available at the time (early 2000's).  When the 1Ds and 5D models first became available, I drooled, but couldn't justify the amount of money.  So I waited.  Along came the 5D Mark II (or as we say in the software industry, version 2.0)  The price was lower than the original 5D and the quality and speed were even better then the now-three year old model.  I saved my pennies and nickels for a while and finally purchased one!From the moment I picked up the demonstrator model in the store, I knew this was the camera for me.  Well balanced, large view-finder, and *gasp* video!  I'm not much of a videographer, but seriously, taking HD clips with a prime lens on a full-frame sensor is just insane!Pros:- Low-light performance has to be seen to be believed.  I'm sure you have heard the hype, but it's not hype.  You really can take reasonable pictures in much darker rooms than you ever thought possible.- Well balanced in your hands- Simple menu system that does not require an engineering degree to use.- Image quality (IQ) that simply blows away everything else in its class.- Price is actually reasonable for what you get; hundreds less than the competition.- Video!Cons:- The IQ is _too_ good.  You can actually tell the difference between pictures taken with \"L\" glass and those that were not.- Frame rate isn't great for sports.  If this is your intended use, look at the 7D or 1D.- Video limited in odd ways.  Then again, this is a DSLR, not a camcorder.In spite of what I just said about taking pictures with \"L\" glass, this camera is perfectly serviceable with regular lenses.  Just realize that they are \"consumer\" grade and will have issues when shot wide open or when at the minimum or maximum of the zoom range.  That said, the \"nifty fifty\" (50mm f/1.8) that sells for around $100 takes astonishingly good pictures.If you're just starting out, the lenses that I would recommend buying with this body are:17-40mm f/4 L - Eye-popping landscapes.  The 16-35mm f/2.8 L is a stop faster, but neither lens will see much indoor use as you would have to be mere inches away from your subject to fill the frame.  The extra stop also doubles the price with little benefit in the scenarios that it is likely to be used.  At 2.8 the faster lens is quite soft, and the image quality in general is not quite as good.  Save your money and get the 17-40.  You won't be sorry!24-70mm f/2.8 L - Fantastic walk-around lens.  The 24-105mm f/4 that comes in the 5DMkII kit has more reach and is image stabilized, but I still prefer the speed of the 24-70.  You can do more with it in lower light sitations.70-200mm f/2.8 L - The IS version of this lens is silly expensive, but the standard version shares the same glass with its brother.  For portraits and weddings, you cannot have a finer lens.  The f/4 cousins are smaller and lighter.  If you plan to shoot outdoors most of the time where there is sufficient light, then you should be fine with it.  Indoors you will find yourself using a flash more often, even with the IS version of the f/4.  The bokeh from the f/2.8 is noticeably better too.50mm f/1.8 or f/1.4 - The \"L\" version of this lens is f/1.2 and about $1k more.  It's soft at f/1.2 and shoots its best at f/1.4 and higher.  The \"L\" glass _is_ better than its cheaper cousins, but is it really worth it?  This is one of the rare cases where there is little need to buy the \"L\" version.  Buy the f/1.4 for $350 or the f/1.8 for $100 and enjoy it.", "Date": "December 31, 2009"}, {"Title": "Great Camera for my First Full Frame", "Author": "Catherine Rodery \"Cat\"", "ReviewID": "R6R69HOWSRFVD", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This was my first full frame camera. Prior to it I had owned and operated a 40D, 30D and Rebel XTi. I am a wedding and sports photographer primarily, so I have been able to test the 5D Mark II out under both of these conditions.For basketball I used it with AI Servo, Center Point focus, but went into custom settings and enabled the AF assist dots. It worked like a dream, focusing faster and more accurately than my 40D ever had. While no, the FPS aren't ideal for sports, if you can lock on focus like this from the start, you can still achieve amazing sports photographs. Plus the fact that I was able to shoot at ISO 4,000 and not have noticeable noise was just incredible. The shots auto-white balanced correctly too which normally in the arena I shoot at is not what happens on my 40D.My first wedding all I could say all day was wow. I was getting available light photographs I never would have dreamed of before. The new screen also made it incredibly easy to determine if something was in focus or not. When I would switch between my 40D and 5D2 I found out just how spoiled that screen had made me, since the 40D screen looked terrible to me now when previously I thought that had a great screen. I sure was wrong! 920,000 pixels is definitely the way to go on this LCD. I primarily shot with center point (one shot) for my focus and it nailed focus every time. I did a mix up of manual, aperture priority and some program (Program mostly for the formals)What else do I love about it? The 98% view finder is awesome. I like being able to use UDMA cards in it...Video! Although I'm not a video / motion person by nature, I prefer stills, I've been testing out the video quite a bit. At Christmas I took a few short clips of my nephew and was really happy with how they look. It's very neat to be able to take high definition video of a little kid and have that awesome affect of a wide aperture blurring out the background. The only downside is that the files are huge. My 1 minute clip was over 300MB, but that's what I get for shooting in 1080!The batteries this camera use really do hold a charge for a while. I used mine with the battery grip at the wedding, and the two batteries after going for over 500 shots (maybe close to 600 shots that day?) still had about 72% charge each left on them. I could easily have shot 3 times that much and still have had left over charge on the batteries. Also the new battery info screen is really nifty since you can see what serial number battery has what charge, making it a lot easier to keep track of.So far I've used a 35 1.4/L, 135 2/L, 70-200 f2.8/L, 50 1.4, and 100 2.8 Macro on this camera body and all have performed wonderfully. I don't miss the pop up flash that my 40D has since I never used it anyway, I always throw my 580 EX II on top when I need flash.This camera really is a gem and I highly recommend it if it fits in your budget!", "Date": "December 27, 2008"}, {"Title": "Tremendous image quality, some usability caveats", "Author": "D. Alexander", "ReviewID": "R19HJE6TMVSVOD", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "If your livelihood doesn't depend on the capture of fast objects, this will give you 95% of the image quality of the 5D III or 1D X. It's a major upgrade to the original 5D, though marginally inferior to the new 6D.I bought a 5D II to replace a 50D and a 40D. I've also used a 7D professionally. The latter three bodies have higher framerates, superior AF tracking, and a higher pixel density that benefits distant subjects. The 5D II is preferable for any other purpose if you can swing the cost of lenses that'll do justice across the frame to such enormous resolution.HANDLING:This is a 50D-generation camera, so the learning curve from that one (and the 40D) is essentially nil. A handful of custom functions differ. The original 5D is a bigger jump; button placement is about the same on the new model, but the menu system has been completely revised (for the better). The 40D/50D have marginally lower weight, smaller size, and a superior grip. Buttons have a positive click. The 5D II has mushy buttons that activate at some indeterminate point.In use, the 5D II's viewfinder is massively larger than the tunnel-like crop bodies. This pulls you into the scene, though framing is actually easier with the smaller finders. Balancing that is comparatively lethargic shutter and mirror response. The 40D/50D are 40% quicker on this front; the difference between 220ms and 160ms. You can't afford a lazy reaction time with this body.I've also detected a rare playback hesitation. I tend to a snap a shot and immediately press play if it doesn't appear on the screen. For perhaps 1 shot in 40, my 5D II has been unresponsive to that button for seconds at a time after the shot. The image appears eventually. The 40D/50D are impossible to trip up like this. This smacks of a software glitch, though I may query Canon at some point to verify.Exposure seems less reliable in difficult lighting. Set to evaluative metering, the 5D II tends to overexpose dark scenes and underexpose backlit people. It's not that clever. I've had to rely on EC and spot metering modes more than with the 40D.Like the 40D/50D, Auto-ISO is next to useless, so you end up fiddling with settings more than with, say, the 5D III, 7D, or 1D X. In aperture priority, Auto-ISO will set a shutter to the lens focal length or 20% less. Prone to hand-shake? Too bad. In shutter priority, it'll start dropping your chosen shutter when it reaches ISO 3200. That's the maximum ISO it'll use in any mode. And in manual mode, Auto-ISO isn't; it just fixes itself to ISO 400. So if you want to control your depth of field and shutter and the let the ISO dynamically adjust, you're SOL on this body. Major oversight.Note that this body doesn't have a popup flash. I'm not lamenting the absence, it's always been a bone to casual shooters more than a serious tool. Max sync speed for most Canon bodies is 1/250, so it only worked for outdoor fill with narrow apertures. Indoors as a main light source, the tiny size and close proximity to the lens led to red eyes and a flat, unflattering high-contrast look. A much preferable setup for event photography pairs a 430EX or 580EX, ideally diffused or aimed to bounce off a nearby surface.Nitpicking aside, the 5D II handles as well as any recent Canon DSLR. It's much quicker if you take the time to configure it to your preferences.FOCUS:Better than expected. The 40D/50D have 9 cross-points. The 5D II has one center cross-point, 8 outer single-axis points, and 6 invisible AF assist points near the center point. In practice, the 5D II is a center-point camera unless you're shooting at wide apertures (f/2 or lower).Center-point AF is very accurate and hits in almost any lighting. Better than the 40D/50D (and even the 1D IV, I've heard) when the lights dim. The only environment where I've had trouble grabbing focus had an exposure of ISO 25600, f/2, 1/50.Surround-point accuracy is questionable. This is the major weakness of the 5D II. You'll want to use wide-aperture lenses like the 85/1.8 and 50/1.4 to take advantage of the thinner depth-of-field and superior foreground/background blur that full-frame offers. These apertures punish focus-recompose, so you need to use the outer points for off-center compositions. They're fast enough, but not consistent or accurate. If your results are critical, take a lot of refocused safety shots.Focus tracking is surprisingly decent with a high-contrast subject that you can hold exactly in the center of the viewfinder, provided you've enabled the invisible assist points with CF III.7. Once your object starts straying to the outer points, all bets are off; the 40D/50D excel here. Still, contrary to expectation, the 5D II can follow moving objects. The outer point accuracy was a greater letdown.STILLS IMAGE QUALITY:Excellent. Per-pixel sharpness is much higher than the crop bodies with the same lens. Combined with superior resolution, you can expect perhaps 30% more detail relative to a 7D and 50% more than a 50D. It's not a subtle difference. Load the comparison tool at The Digital Picture for this body and any crop body on the same lens. Pixel for pixel, the crop bodies always look blurry by comparison.Noise is better with some caveats. The 5D II is not a magical darkness camera. You're not going to be able to shoot by candlelight with high fidelity. My 40D went to ISO 3200. This camera goes to ISO 25600, but the actual difference in raw is more like 1.5 stops on the outside. Unlike the 40D, boosting the shadows multiple stops reveals color banding that's difficult to remove in post. Blue channel noise is also more severe than expected. Still, I don't have qualms about running it to ISO 6400 for professional gigs. The 40D and 50D, I wouldn't push past 1600. The 5D III gets you an extra stop in raw and less shadow banding for a usable ISO 12800.Dynamic range is somewhat better on the 40D than the others, interestingly. The 5D II's performance is typical for most DSLRs. You'll be blending exposures or pulling the shadows way up in scenes with high contrast.LENSES:I want to segue into this section because it's entwined with image quality. Comparing full-frame and crop isn't quite apples to apples. It's much easier to find crop lenses with good edge performance. This 5D II makes hash of almost all the mid-range variable-aperture zooms Canon has released over the years. I was pleased with my 28-135/3.5-5.6 IS on my 40D. Very consistent sharpness across the frame, even wide open. On a 5D II, the same lens falls down. Poor edge performance, lots of aberrations.Expect to pay 30-50% more on glass to feed this camera relative to EF-S lenses. Full-frame L glass costs a mint, but most of the third-party wide to mid-focal lenses don't emphasize edge performance. I've used a 14/2.8, 24-105/4, 100/2, and 200/2.8 among others. The latter two are stellar across the frame, as is the Samyang ultrawide. The 24-105/4 and a 17-40/4L I once had are merely adequate. Neither perform that well in the corners at f/4. Even older L zooms like the 17-35/2.8 are subpar on the 5D II.What should your kit be? Some considerations:* Primes are lighter, smaller, cheaper, often available in wider apertures, often optically better, and have less manufacturing variation. They're less convenient, less versatile, updated with new technologies (e.g., stabilization, better lens coatings, weight reductions, faster or more accurate AF) less often, and can cause you to miss shots in fast-paced shooting environments.* There are different requirements for movie lenses and still lenses. No Canon full-frame zooms are optimal for movies. Some are more optimal than others (e.g., less focus breathing, more parfocal, less distortion, smoother operation, distance scale). Primes often fare better.* An f/2.8 lens on this body is just fast enough for most indoor use without flash. You'll want a flash for anything slower. A flash can provide more even, pleasing pictures, at the expense of a bulkier, attention-attracting rig.* Kits with more than three primary lenses can become unwieldy in use. Two is preferable. My walkaround kit is a 16-35/2.8 and a 100/2, or a 24-105/4 alone if I expect to shoot movies. Professional event shooters tend to rely on the 16-35/2.8, 24-70/2.8, 70-200/2.8, and faster primes like the 85/1.2 as necessary.* Third-party lenses tend to have less upfront cost, better warranties, and more aggressive designs. AF and optical performance is often (but not always) inferior to OEM lenses, quality control is less consistent, and resale values are lower. Value varies by lens model. Some are better than the OEM equivalents (e.g., Tamron 70-300 VC). Some fill holes in the OEM lineup (e.g., Sigma 120-300/2.8 OS). And some are near-substitutes for less cost (e.g., Sigma 70-200/2.8 OS). Where a third-party lens duplicates the OEM and has similar performance, I tend to choose a used copy of the OEM model.VIDEO:Out of the box, 5D II video has four characteristics: lovely depth-of-field-control with the right lenses, clipped colors, high contrast, and about 720p worth of actual detail at the 1080p setting.There's no autofocus worth using. It's possible to gauge focus from the bare LCD screen, though you're still liable to overshoot and undershoot constantly. Video here is very much a professional feature, despite the shortsighted exclusion of manual exposure and audio control in the original 5D II firmware. The latest firmware provides both, but if you're at all serious about video, install Magic Lantern. It's a third-party piggyback firmware with dozens of new controls. To do it justice would require a review larger than this one, but a key feature is focus peaking, which shows little noise outlines on the area of maximum sharpness. With wide-aperture lenses, you'll be dead-on with manual focus every time.In terms of post-processing flexibility, Canon EOS video is like shooting JPEG, but worse because the H.264 video codec throws away even more unseen data. You have none of the lossless adjustability of raw, so it's pivotal to lower contrast to preserve detail in the highlights and shadows, dial back the colors to prevent clipping, and lower sharpening so you can add it back in post without causing nasty artifacts. You do that by setting the correct white balance in advance and by creating or downloading a custom tone curve with low contrast, color, and sharpening. The latter won't affect your stills if you shoot in raw, so you can cater it solely to video.Camera shake is another issue. If you're going to shoot without a tripod, get a stabilized lens. In fact, just buy the 24-105/4L IS. No other lens has the combination of size, weight, edge performance, range, stabilization, consistent aperture, speed, and partial parfocal (holding focus through the zoom range) ability.The next best choice might be something like the Tamron 24-70/2.8 VC. Anything over 50mm that isn't stabilized will challenge your ability to record smooth footage. You can fix that later by transcoding to an editable format and using the anti-shake facilities of Adobe Premiere, Sony Vegas, or Virtual Dub with Deshaker, but that's a pain and they all crop the frame. Start with stabilization from the outset and save yourself the bother.Stabilized lenses cause a new problem: the IS system is audible on the audio track. It's obvious with the 70-200/4L IS, noticeable with the 24-105/4L IS, and a background hum with the 70-200/2.8L IS I/II. That's in addition to dial clicks, finger movement, and wind noise, which obscure what would be fairly mediocre sound quality in the best case. The 5D II records CD-quality 48 KHz 16-bit stereo tracks; the fault is with the internal mic and amplifier. The simplest, most portable solution is to attach an external battery-powered mic to the flash hotshoe. The two most popular are around $250 from Rode. Zoom's H1 stereo recorder is a cheaper, more versatile alternative that can also be camera-mounted.ACCESSORIES:For video, buy CF cards 32 GB or larger. 1080p/30 video is 350 MB/minute. My pair of 16 GB cards have been inadequate for even a one-day event. Choose SanDisk. I've never had a SanDisk card of any size fail, they maintain higher resale value than other brands, and they tend to write somewhat faster than competitors with the same speed rating.Camera operation isn't much affected by card speed. The difference appears when you start leaning on the raw buffer with more than 15 continuous shots at 4 FPS. Faster cards clear the buffer faster. Raw write speed with a 200X Sandisk is about 22 MB/s. With 400X, it's 36 MB/s. With a 1000X Lexar, it reaches 50 MB/s. Video only needs about 6 MB/s; I couldn't make the video buffering icon appear until I tried a 512 MB PNY CF card from 2005. The choice is easy if you're opting for 32 GB; SanDisk doesn't sell the 200X Ultra in that size, so you're left with either the 400X Extreme or the 600X Pro. The latter is 15% quicker with raw for 80% more money. It only makes sense if you're time-limited on card-to-computer transfers.If you buy protection filters for your lenses, choose Hoya's \"DMC PRO1 Clear Protector Digital\" line. They have 99.5% light transmission and don't cause flare. Digital sensors filter UV natively, there's no reason to pay more for that feature. I've written reviews on the relevant Hoya product pages with more details and why you might (or might not) want a filter.Third-party LP-E6 batteries are hit or miss. Even the highly-rated models have their share of duds. I had an STK battery fail two weeks after purchase. I've never had, and have rarely heard of, a Canon OEM battery failure. They also tend to retain more charge capacity for a longer period. Your call whether that's worth five times the price.SETTINGS:Some settings only affect JPEG images. Turn them off if you shoot raw. These include:* Peripheral illumination correction (reverses edge darkening from some lenses)* High ISO speed noise reduction (affected raw on the 40D, doesn't here)* Auto lighting optimizer (pulls up the shadows in high-dynamic-range scenes)These affect raw:* Highlight tone priority (an extra half-stop of highlight range, more shadow noise)* Long exposure noise reduction (dark-frame subtraction and the like for long exposures)Two major new features with the 5D II are the C1/C2/C3 custom dial settings and the personalized menu page. This is my menu page:* Format (erase the CF card)* Mirror lockup (flip the mirror before taking the shot; reduces blur from mirror vibration)* Highlight tone priority (only enabled in bright, high-contrast conditions)* Shutter button/AF-ON button (binds AF to the shutter button for handing the camera to someone else)* Exp.Comp/AEB (exposure compensation and bracketing; useful for HDR)* White balance (irrelevant for raw, important for video)COMPARISONS:vs. 5D I - The old 5D ($700 used) has fine image quality. Per-pixel noise performance is only about a half-stop worse than the 5D II in raw. Dynamic range is about the same. In every other way, the 5D is archaic. Old-style menus, no AF-on button, no MFA, slow operation, a terrible low-contrast and low-resolution screen, and no facility to easily change settings on the fly. You basically shoot it like a film camera. If you have all the time in the world to set up a shot and you don't need video, the 5D is fine. Otherwise, the 5D II ($1500 used) is worth every additional penny.vs. 5D III - The new 5D (~$3000) has a massively better AF system, a 50% faster 6fps framerate, and about a stop of extra noise performance. Image quality is otherwise very similar. Buy the new one if you need superlative tracking and shooting of fast or unpredictable objects. Otherwise, save the difference.vs. 7D - Like a 5D III without full-frame or the noise performance. Choose it for AF speed and tracking (inferior to the 5D III but well above the 5D II), 8fps continuous shooting, and the telephoto reach that comes from a higher pixel density. Don't expect the same detail as the 5D II at wider focals. It's also about a full stop worse in noise.vs. 6D - Compared at the same price, the 6D is a better body in most circumstances. Compared to a $1500 5D II, it may not presently be worth the cost difference. It'll be more interesting when prices drop in the $1800 range, probably before the new year. Here's a breakdown of the 6D vs. 5D II:+ GPS (to tag photos)+ Wifi (to share directly online and for easier tethering/remote storage)+ 1 stop less noise in raw+ 4.5 fps vs. 3.9 fps+ 10% smaller by volume+ Silent shutter capability+ 30% less shutter lag+- AF center point is better in low light, but missing the 5D II's assist points for tracking+- SD instead of CF (only matters if you already have CF cards)- 1/4000 max shutter vs. 1/8000 (matters for wide-aperture lenses shot in daylight)- No sync port- No joystick for direct AF selection; have to use a rocker panel inside the thumb wheel- No Magic Lantern as yetIf you can pick up a 5D II for a song, don't feel like you're missing out.WHERE TO BUY:Canon often sells refurbished bodies at a 20% discount as part of their loyalty program (wherein you send back a broken Canon camera of any type), which puts them perhaps 10% below market rate. These bodies are vetted by Canon, in as-new condition with all accessories, and often have shutter counts under 1000. They're warranted for 90 days. This seems preferable to used bodies of unknown provenance.If you intend to downvote, please leave a comment. I do try to be accurate, I'd much prefer to know the issue.", "Date": "August 1, 2012"}, {"Title": "Mostly positive, but mixed feelings", "Author": "Glenn Przyborski", "ReviewID": "R25PCH7W4SFMVN", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "First the good...If you're looking for an excellent, full-frame DSLR, the 5D Mk2 is very, very good. It's at least 1 full F-stop more sensitive to light than my Canon 1DS Mk2. A setting of ASA 800 or 1000 yields about the same noise level as my older camera at ASA 400. It's autofocus system is very fast and accurate on single shot mode. (I don't think EF-L series lenses are capable of faster focus action.)The new LCD screen is gorgeous. 3\" diagonal with 900,000+ pixels. It's possibly the best quality LCD screen ever put on a DSLR. The menus are easier to understand and navigate than the 1DS Mk2's menus. \"Live View\" is an excellent way to do critical focusing. If you've never used a DSLR with live view, you'll love it. The only negative of live-view is that it really drains your battery and it can only be used for a certain length of time before the CMOS imager circuitry heats up, adding noise to the image. (In real-life typical shooting, overheating is not a problem and besides the camera will auto cancel live-view if it senses an over temperature condition.)The huge 21 mega-pixel RAW images are excellent. The camera uses an updated variant on Canon's .CR2 RAW format so if you use an older version of Adobe's Lightroom or Photoshop for image processing, you'll need the latest Lightroom 2.2 or Photoshop CS4 to get the proper RAW converter. I've personally never liked the included software for RAW image processing, but many people are happy with it.The auto-exposure system seems very accurate... more accurate than my 1DS Mk2.I never experienced any \"black dot\" phenomenon. But I've only shot RAW images at less than 1200 ASA. The \"black dot\" sample images that I've seen on the internet look like simple, in-camera, over-enhancement of highlights. Besides, unless you're shooting sports at night or are part of a CSI team, who shoots at 3200+ ASA anyway? If you're doing a night shot of a city use a tripod, a longer exposure, and a lower ASA. This will yield rich, clean blacks and much higher detail in highlights. Also, although JPEG's are much smaller, every professional photographer that I know shoots only RAW images.I ordered the camera with the optional BG-E6 battery grip. This grip makes the camera taller and easier to hold. It allows simultaneous use of 2 Canon lithium batteries or 6- AA alkaline or rechargeables. It's a very valuable accessory to consider.Now the bad...I primarily purchased the camera for its ability to shoot great looking 1080P HD video for commercial TV projects. I thought it would be a great source for \"B-Roll\" cutaways and inserts.The biggest single problem in the video mode is that you have no control over iris, ISO setting, or shutter speed. There's an exposure lock button that will lock the exposure variables to whatever the LCD displays at the time you press the button. There are no on-screen indicators that show the settings that the camera has chosen for you. The only control you have is the color temperature setting. Basically, you pan the camera around in the scene and let the brightness float up and down. When you see what you think is a good exposure on the rear LCD screen, you press the lock button. Since the exposure lock resets after each scene or take, chances are you won't have consistent exposures over multiple takes of a particular scene.Working with the auto exposure system can sometimes be difficult. I was shooting with my 85mm F1.2 lens. By looking at the iris, it appeared the camera had decided to only open the lens to about an F2.8 and use a much higher ISO setting than necessary to achieve proper exposure. By pointing the camera to some very dark shadows, the iris fully opened. I then panned back to my original scene which appeared to be much cleaner and free of noise. You really need to be able to manually set the ISO & F-stop when shooting video.I adjusted the camera's custom settings to lower the detail enhancement and contrast. These controls effect the quality of jpeg stills but seem to have no effect on a video recording.The camera only records at 30.00fps, not 29.97fps. This tiny .03fps difference means that you have to alter each file's header, using a program such as Apple Cinema Tools, before you can edit 5D footage into a normal, broadcast 1080P/1080i, 29.97fps timeline. Failure to do this header alteration requires setting up a 30.00fps timeline or rendering every 5D scene on your 29.97fps timeline which yields periodic skipped frames.There is no 24P (23.98) setting. As far as I'm concerned, there is no logical reason that Canon chose 30.00fps instead of 29.97fps. No broadcast TV or film standard operates at 30.00fps. Maybe Canon will correct this with a future firmware update. Please note that if you're only shooting high quality videos for web release, the 30.00fps speed won't present a problem.To simulate the film-like cadence of a movie camera's 180 degree shutter at 30.00fps, the 5D Mk2's shutter should be set to 1/60 of a second exposure time. There is no way to tell what shutter setting the camera is using during a scene. My gut feeling from looking at camera video is that the 5D Mk2 often uses 1/30 of a second.The camera's LCD screen is blanked whenever an HDMI monitor is plugged in. If you're doing a commercial shoot with clients, this means that either the cameraman or the clients can see what's being shot, but not both at the same time...  You could add an external HDMI active splitter, but this would also require adding and using an external monitor at the camera. If you only plan to shoot by yourself, this shouldn't present a problem.To do manual follow-focusing using the rear LCD screen, consider purchasing Hoodman's 3\" LCD viewer. It's available from B&H; and other retailers and it works very well. Of course, you'll have to figure a custom way to attach it to the back of the 5D Mk2 using rubber bands or Velcro.The 5D Mk2 records what I would call \"memo quality\" audio with it's internal, mono microphone. You really notice the AGC raising and lowering the recording volume. If someone claps their hands, coughs, or makes a loud sound, the audio level and background sound dives down, then very noticeably fades back up. There is no headphone output or on-screen audio display so there's no way to confirm the level of your audio. If you plug an external mic into the camera, there is no indication to confirm even the presence of an audio signal. The only thing you can do is record a scene, then playback and carefully listen to the recorded file. If you plan to use this camera on a professional sync-sound project, you'd really have to consider double system sound recording. Recoding the audio on a separate recorder adds a major level of increased hassle but it's the only way to insure excellent audio. The audio from the camera's recording can be used as a post-production sync reference.Another audio question is why Canon chose to record audio at a sample rate of 44.1kz instead of the industry standard 48kz. Apple's Final Cut Pro can handle almost any sample rate but other NLE's can't. Once again, if you're only shooting video for web release, the CD sample rate of 44.1kz shouldn't present a problem.In certain low light or low contrast scenes, the H.264 encoding block artifacts are noticeable. In my opinion, the 5D Mk2 artifacts are more noticeable than the H.264 encoding used in Canon's own HF10, 1080 video camera even though the 5D's recorded bit rate is higher.The camera's signal-to-noise ratio is very good and very clean. It's a more noise-free video picture than my $80,000 Sony F900R HDCam... except for the color red. Red objects are noisy. Most colors in a scene seem noise free, except red. This is especially true with low brightness red objects such as those in shadow areas.The 5D Mk2 exhibits no \"rolling shutter\" characteristics that are associated with Nikon's D90.The 5D Mk2 has the characteristic of clipping to \"flat-line\" black very low-light or shadow details in an image. This yields a \"gutsy\" rich, excellent, \"film-like\" quality for many scenes, but you can't do any post-production recovery of lost low-light details. The camera does a pretty good job of rolling scene highlights off to a hard clip at 100 units of video.Possibly, some of the problems I've detailed here are related to the specific 5D Mk2 that I purchased (serial#0320105XXX) but I don't think this is the case. Hopefully, Canon will issue a firmware update to address the camera's video problems. New firmware could possibly add manual control to the video capture functions and slightly lower the frame rate to the standard 29.97fps.All cameras at any price level have positives and negatives. I've never found or used the \"perfect\" camera. The Canon 5d Mk2 is an excellent still camera and in my opinion, \"a not quite ready for prime time\" HDTV video camera. Possibly the camera was rushed to market to compete (or cancel out) the much hyped video features of Nikon's \"rolling shutter\" D90. It is an excellent glimpse into the future of \"hybrid\" still & video DSLR cameras.", "Date": "January 1, 2009"}, {"Title": "Impressive!!!", "Author": "Jiu-Shang Yang", "ReviewID": "R1P8PZVOSEYFFP", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I just got my 5D mark II today from Amazon (not the cold-blooded 3rd party dealer). My order was Camera plus 24-105 lens kit at $3499 but somehow it came with body only. I need to work out with Amazon later. Anyway. My 1st DSLR is Canon 40D, which is my baseline for the comparison.Pros:1. Full frame = Real wide angle. My 17-40 lens can now work as it's supposed to.2. High ISO with amazing quality. The noise level at ISO 12800 (H1) in 5D ~= ISO 1250-1600 in 40D. Noise software (ex: Noiseware) can still produce an acceptable image with 12800. Poor quality in 25600 (H2) is expected, and it can be used just in case. So my upper limit boosts from 1250 in 40D to 6400 in 5D which is a 2-1/3 stop jump (Thanks for Johnny Chan's correction).3. High quality LCD with a light sensor, so no need to adjust LCD brightness from time to time. It's neat.4. Autofocus microadjustment by lens.5. Others such as high pixel, HD video, HDMI port... etc, but those are not really a must to me. Still can get 30x20 printout with 10MP 40D by Photoshop.Cons:1. Sync speed = 200ns in 5D while 250ns in 40D. I use Canon 580EX II a lot for portrait shots. So 1-stop shutter speed matters. (Even I can use high speed mode in 580Ex).2. Frame-per-second = 3.9 in 5D but 6.5 in 40DOverall, it's a great upgrade to me and worth every penny.------------------12/24/2008 update------------------1. After calling/email to customer support, Amazon has refunded $800 price difference in 10 hours. I cannot satify more than this.2. New RAW from 5D MK II is no longer supported by Photoshop CS3 and earlier versions. That means upgrading to Photoshop CS4 is a MUST if shooting with RAW. It's another \"hidden\" cost...3. Just got the battery grip BG-E6 today from Adorama for ~$270. The pros is now it takes 6 AA batteries or 2 LP-E3 (which is also expensive ~$75 and also out-of-stock in most of places)...

It's taken a while but I finally pulled the trigger.My first Canon SLR was the EOS 650 - the autofocus SLR that \"started it all\".  Then in early 2000's I got the Digital Rebel, then an XTi and quickly after that the Canon 40D.I've liked all the digital SLR's I've used to date but only the 40D reminded me of the build quality and \"heft\" that my original 650 had.  And although you get used to it, the 1.6 crop factor of the sensor size is really a big difference on the wide-angle side.Over time I also upgraded my lenses to the 17-40 F4L, the 24-105 F4L, the 70-200 F2.8L and the 100-300 F4.5-5.6L - with IS in all but the 17-40.I guess I'd call myself an \"advanced amateur\".  My usual approach to photography is to compose a good shot and then crop later to a better composition to get my \"keepers\".With the 40D and my outfit of lenses I can pretty much do it all - especially on the telephoto side.  However, I noticed that when you crop significantly a 10.1MP image, the end result can have significantly reduced image quality.So - I determined a little more megapixels to work with would be helpful.Next, the 40D's max ISO is 1600 but at 800 the noise can be a bit of a distraction.  The simple solution is to stay below 800 but that requires a flash or photos of stationary objects in darker settings.So - I determined that something with better light sensitivity would be helpful.I noticed that some of my lenses were sharper than others on the 40D.  I sent the body to Canon with my 24-105 to get the focusing \"matched\" and the results were good.  But it was a one-size fits all solution.So - I determined that something that offered lens microadjustment would be helpful.I watched and waited patiently for the \"brouhaha\" of enthusiam for the 5D MarkII to settle down as I'm not the sort of sucker that pays more than MSRP for anything.  I knew my time would come, I'd get my 5DMarkII - even if my wife said no.  Now the MSRP is $200 less!Finally, along comes this blasted Canon 7D to totally ruin my plan.  It solves my megapixel issue, it solves my ISO issue, it has lens microadjustment (as does the 50D) it even offers an advanced video capability and \"new and improved\" autofocusing system.  And it's $800+ less expensive.  What a quandary.... now what?With much consternation and angst I debated over and over the 7D or 5DMII.  On the one hand, on the other had - you know the drill.  Is the 5DMII worth it?I put my 17-40 lens on the 40D and then on my EOS650 and like I said - the difference is huge between a full frame and cropped sensor.  I'm not a video-enthusiast and I'm not really sure what the big deal is about \"24p\" vs \"30p\" so that wasn't too important.  I believe with autofocusing - \"it's not the arrow, it's the indian\" and unless something's out of wack your images should be focused or you're making a mistake.So, I took the plunge and purchased the 5D Mark II.It's awesome.The look and feel is very EOS-like.  Not too different than my 40D - probably a little better in fact.  I like the Creative Auto mode a lot and the menu on the LCD is great.The ISO range is totally worth it.  I take shots routinely at 3200 and they look like 400 on the 40D (very minimal noise / graininess).  When I use a flash - the results are amazing.I microadjusted the camera for all the lenses I own, and as expected the settings for each were slightly different.  Now my images are spot-on, unless I screw up (again - it's not the arrow, it's the indian).To top it all off - Canon is coming out with a firmware update to add 24p (et al) to the 5DMark II.The Live-view mode is much simpler than on the 40D and focusing is very easy.The 21 Megapixels is way more than I really need but when I crop my images I get great results so I'm delighted there.  I delete images I don't like so my storage constraints are limited.Finally - the full-frame sensor gives me all the image my considerable lens investment can provide and offers me opportunity on the wide angle side that the 7D couldn't.  It's a big deal and not to be discounted (although you can get an EFS 10-22 to make up for it on a cropped body).I'm sure the 7D is an awesome camera too and I bet the autofocus system is an improvement.  However - if you're like me, you've got great lenses, you've been patiently waiting for the hysteria to calm down, and you're ready to change camera bodies then I totally recommend going full frame and getting the 5D Mark II.", "Date": "March 5, 2010"}, {"Title": "Great camera for travel, scenics and available light", "Author": "David C. Stephens", "ReviewID": "R38TYMQWIL7RUX", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I took deliver in mid-December and now have around 2,000 pictures, mostly taken on a cruise.The resolution is stunning, but only as good as the lens used. The 24-105 supplied in the kit is good, but a little soft compared to my very good EF-L 70-200 IS f4. I took 80% of my shots with the 24-105 but looked for opportunities to use the 70-200 instead, particularly for scenics. I'll probably buy a prime wide angle or wide angle zoom for the big, wide scencis, where the 24-105 gets particularly soft. As you'd expect, it's pretty solid through the middle of its range.Shooting at ISO 1600 and 3200 was amazing, yielding lots of early morning and late evening scenics and hand held candids of the kids inside. When I put on the Speedlite for a big New Year's party, those results were also stunning. Yet, for a full room shoot with baloons dropping, I went to ISO 3200 and used available light with a great result.I bought the 5D MkII for stills, so I haven't even tried the video yet. It's nice to have that on hand. I did use \"live view\" several times. That's quick and easy to use when you need it. I've used jpeg rather than RAW because I'd be taking so many photos. There are only four or five instances out of 2000 where I wish that I'd taken RAW. With the jpegs I cropped a dozen or so and altered contrast on just a couple. I generally shot the scenics at 1/3 stop under. I used the lens hoods 90+% of the time and kept a Hoya Pro UV filter on at all times.Black dots have not been an issue, but I haven't taken any shots that would lead to them, according to the causes I've read about.I'd rate the body-only as five-star and only give the 4-star overall for the kit, given the limitations of the 24-105 zoom in the kit. It's actually a very competitive zoom for this range, but I immediately saw a difference for the better with my EF 70-200. They're both L-series, but the wide angles are challenging for a super zoom. Given the low noise at 3200 ISO, I found the f4 lens speed to be plenty fast. The clarity at high ISO was the biggest positive surprise for me.", "Date": "January 6, 2009"}, {"Title": "A very worthy successor to the 5D", "Author": "Comdet", "ReviewID": "R1FAZL1C6MONZ1", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I've used and throughly enjoyed a 5D for a couple of years, and have found it to be a simply outstanding full-frame camera. Like a lot of people, I was eagerly looking forward to the 5D Mark II, and pre-ordered one. After using it for a few weeks, I am pleased to report that this is an excellent update to the 5D.If you're researching this camera, you've probably heard about the \"black dot\" problem (basically, some dark pixels to the right of blown highlights). Unless you're printing photos in the several feet by several feet size, you'll never see them. Sure, I'll download a firmware fix when it's available, but in the meantime, I've never encountered even the slightest problem in real-world use.Size and controls are very comparable to the 5D - you'll feel at ease very quickly. The viewfinder is fantastic -- bigger, brighter, and a very welcome addition. There are many \"under the skin\" upgrades, the biggest being 21.1 megapixels. So much more flexibility in shooting, but be prepared for some huge raw files! A processor upgrade (DIGIC 4) keeps things moving along at a good clip. I can't comment on the HD video capture since I'm just dabbling with it at the moment and have essentially no experience as a videographer. But, looking forward to learning. The video capture was just icing on the cake for me - bought it for still photos.Disappointments are very few and far between, such as the fact that the battery pack is a different design, so it can't be interchanged with the 5D. Supposedly, it has a longer life, but model interchangeability would be nice to keep the add-on costs down. I also regularly shoot with my 40D and Rebel (with the latter converted to IR), so the greater the interchangeability, the better.In short, this is an outstanding camera, and one that will be a welcome addition to anyone's kit. If you already have a 5D and use it a lot, the Mark II is well worth the cost. The kit is a good value versus the body -- the 24-105 f/4 L IS is one of the best walk around lens available. Should you not have a need for it, you can get a good price for it on the used market.If you're presently working with a crop sensor camera, you will be amazed at what a full frame will do for you (although, be prepared to spend some coin on some good glass -- once you get the L lens fever, you'll never want to go back!). Keep in mind that the original 5D is still available, and going at a very nice price new (and some outright steals for used bodies). The original is still a fantastic camera, and well worth considering if budget is tight.One final point -- the RAW files are not compatable with CS3. But, the recent update to Lightroom (2.2) solves that problem. No need to update to CS4 just for that.", "Date": "December 28, 2008"}, {"Title": "The review I was looking for", "Author": "Silverback", "ReviewID": "RV7UUE2AB2S6H", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "First, you can buy the body for 2600 from most stores/online, I dont know why Amazon is charging 3K.Let me give a quick rundown so you know where I am coming from. I am a serious amateur, did film photography (developed my own film:-) ) for 1 year in HS, then took 5-6 years camera free, and the last 3-4 years with a 30D. I like to shoot anything really: landscapes, macro and plants (my favorites), followed by animals, birds (70/30 rest vs flight), and people/portraits. No sports. I prefer B&W.; I use the camera for my own enjoyment/photography practice and at parties and school club events, and lots of travel. It gets a pretty well rounded tour of duty. I had from a 30D before, which I loved. So let me get to the nitty gritty.(BTW, if you are looking for pixel peeping, you won't get it here. I'm looking to add a more detail and subjective feel of using the camera, and answer the questions I had before I bought.  I shoot primes and have 2Ls, so IQ is limited by my skill. I have slightly more money than sense, and I am very anal about noise and IQ.)I've had the 5D mkII for about 2-3 weeks and have only taken about 100-150 images with it I would say. Sorry, I've been busy!#Image Quality/MegapixelsOut of this world. The images look very, very real. I don't know what else to say. Smooth colors and grades. Deep blacks. Colors comes out just how I remember them. Noise performance is great, super clean until 800, even 1600 ISO (by my standards. I used to hate anything above 400).. It is clearly aimed at people who like to print large, hi-res, fine art style work. Unfortunately the noise is that weird Canon stuff, but its not as bad as I feared, and could pass for film grain. I can shoot handheld indoors with very good results. 21 megapixels is WAY more than I want; but I can crop to my hearts content and still print big! I can actually crop images to \"the exact same\" frame that my 30D would have taken and have more MP... thats actually what pushed me over the edge to buy.  Unforutately my 2.4 Ghz imac converts the RAW files very slowly. Editing is still fast enough. There is some debate online that as printers are able to print at higher and higher dpi, higher MP counts may make a difference. I agree with this, but only insofar as a medium format vs 35mm difference; 8mp will always look great at the common print sizes. PS: Canon, hire some of Nikons engineers to fix the look of your noise....#AF systemIt would have been nice to have new one, but my 30D AF never really failed me, and this is basically the same. For the money I would have REALLY liked to have the upgrade. Yet since it never hindered me before, and I don't shoot sports or BIF often, it's ok by me. People really complain about this, but seriously...the nine points system IS old, but it works and works well enough. To be honest I would rather have the last iteration of a proven AF than the first generation of a new one.#Build qualityThe slightly bigger size feels much more balanced, and \"right\", than the 30D. My 30D went shooting at glaciers, rain forest, jungle, and forests and in snow, rain, heavy fog, sand etc etc and didn't miss a beat, albeit in only 3 years. With upgraded seals, I have no doubts about this 5DII. The \"real\" weather seal of the 1D would  be great, but I don't go shooting in downpours or sandstorms.#Full frame vs 1.6I really miss my 1.6 free zoom factor, especially when it comes to macro. A lot of my shooting is \"screwed up\" now, and I have to readjust. But it feels good to be so wide and landscapes are looking great. I'm gonna pick up a long zoom and I should be fine. It is mostly hard to adjust because the 100mm macro on the 1.6 was a real joy to use (BTW, that lens has given me the most keepers per dollar of anything, buy one if you are debating it).#Movie mode/live viewLive view is great for macro. The video capability is great and very fun, and it is easy to focus manually with the large screen. I was concerned about having to focus in movie mode, but I like it more than the AF. Even on camcorders the AF isn't great. I guess I might use it video once in a while sitting in the airport or for Grandpa blowing out the candles. The video looks great, having the lens capability and shallow DoF is cool...but I barely have enough time to edit my photos, let alone a video. All jokes aside, its useful and nice and a welcome addition; its better to have than not, especially for quick little moments.#Odds and Ends-The viewfinder is great. I really feel like I am looking through the lens; my 30D feels like a peephole now.-The AF matrix looks smaller to me, but I can't be certain. I don't know if the spread stays the same as the sensor size increases, but it certainly feels like it.-AF micro adjust lets me be sure my lenses are spot on (5/7 were), the dust shake is nice too.-RF remote capability is a plus-Rear screen is sharp sharp sharp!-Its great to have more battery bars; the life is excellent, and now more accurate.-Finally, I don't have all those silly automatic modes on my dial, except for the new Creative Auto. Really.-If you care about the lack of onboard flash....1. Onboard flash sucks. Buy a real one (I have a 430EX and its good enough) you will thank yourself. 2. You can shoot handheld in low light with this baby anyways. If its dim, ISO has you covered, if its dark, use the external; the onboard wouldn't cut it then. There is an AF assist lamp on board, but it hasn't fired yet.-Viewfinder blackout is noticeably longer than my 30D; the change in shutter lag is not.#My complaints-FPS: 4fps on a 2600 dollar \"pro\" camera? If you shoot sports or birds a lot, stick with the 3/4/50D unless you really want full frame. Or wait for the rumoured 7D/3D. 4 fps is great for once in a while users (like me) though. I don't really mind it. If anything it teaches me to be better about timing.-Why does the camera not have a built in intervelometer? thats stupid. It has enough screen and processing power to do it.-I can't delete Picture styles: Canon has downloadable styles to use in your 3 custom modes. I shoot RAW, so they are meaningless, but I still want them. Unfortunately I can't delete the default ones I don't use so I can have only my favorites. I would have to transfer the settings manually somehow...and record the defaults.-The controls: ok, this REALLY steams my clams. Canon has the big control wheel. I love it. But for some reason they have decided to make the control stick the center of their new (to me) menu system. It is small, awkward, far away, and slow.  Furthermore, the wheel scrolls up and down: why? Left and right would be far more useful (since there are more menus in that direction; 9 vs 5). You lose 3/4 of a star for this Canon. I am a perfectionist. Perfect score means perfect camera, and small things count.-They have this newfangled menu thing that shows all the camera settings at once on the rear screen and you can change all of them. Unfortunately, the top LCD already shows me the info, and using the screen is slower than using the buttons and the wheels. Its useful at night, so I dont have to push the light button though. If you set it to work with the info button (a Custom Function), it is VERY hard (for me at least) to get out of. I don't really like it but its starting to grow on me.-The button for the top light is recessed and I have to try pushing it a few times to get it to work. Hopefully its just my copy. Minus 1/4 star because I shoot a lot in dimly lit areas.-Please be aware sRAW (you can shoot RAW at less MP if you want; it is called an sRAW file) does not work on Aperture yet(!)#Why I gave it 4 stars and not 5I would have given it 5 stars if not for the illogical change to the menu controls (I hate wasting time in menu-land) and the poor light button. And the lack of intervelometer. I would also like to tell Canon, if by the grace of god you are reading this, that I have an app on my iphone that calculates the hyperfocal distance, something landscape shooters love. On your pro landscape/studio body, can you not BUILD IN this table/formula into the menu? even better, have the camera set the lens AT the hyperfocal distance? I know it already has all the data it needs to read that table. THAT would be be every landscape shooter dream come true.#Bottom line:If you are willing to give up the crop factor/free zoom and the FPS (I prefer to thinking of it as \"back in the day\" performance with closer to \"back in the day\" level of resolution), the 5d mkII will blow your mind. Parties, portraits, kids, pets, animals, sunsets, interiors...you are covered. If you were waiting to go to FF...you won't be disappointed. I feel this is close to film for me.If you shoot BIF, sports, far away animals...you may want to save those upgrade dollars for now. You will be paying to lose zoom and FPS, and the 50D/40D has pretty good noise performance and IQ from what I read.If you have a 5D already, I can't really give any advice since I've never used it.If you have a 3/4/50D and REALLY want to go to FF, think carefully about what kind of shooting you do, then wait until Dec and see if the 3D/7D comes out. I blew my money early, I didn't know about that rumor. Other cameras I considered were a 1DMkII, but the screen is small, its huge, heavy and I would feel like even more of a poser with it, plus I use the screen and crop tool a lot more than max FPS. I also checked out the 5d original, but again, screen too small, DIGIC II, no sensor clean, no lens micro adjust...If you are just getting into dSLR, get a 40D (same as a 50D basically), or heck, a 30D (I love mine) and get some nice glass. Unless you are rich, then get this. Or if you have small hands, then get the Tl1/XTi.Rumor has it there is something coming to \"fill the gap\" for anyone looking to go up from the 50D, but not wanting a 5D or the pricier 1DMkIII or its s verison. It would be ~15mp, ~7fps, and ~the same image quality, and likely FF or 1.3 crop, with a new, better point AF.  I think this is possible, but there are reasons for and against this (ie somewhere for the 50D sports shooter to upgrade to without going to 1D/everyone wants this vs Why would a sports/BIF shooter want to lose the 1.6 crop for comparable IQ?  Esp since Canon is due to upgrade the \"aging\" xxD AF, which will be the \"7D\" everyone wants without cannabilizng the 1DmkIII).I would maybe want that gap filler, mostly to ease the strain on my computer and keep that high FPS (its a guy thing, need for speed). But computers improve too, and I am VERY happy with the 5dmkII, I may cast an envious eye when/if this 3d/7d comes (Dec?) but I won't be selling or thinking twice.IMO, a classic camera.", "Date": "July 20, 2009"}, {"Title": "Best Full-Frame Camera: Don't drink Nikon Cool-Aid just yet", "Author": "R. Auger", "ReviewID": "R34B4WID4IH40U", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "In real world and in the studio, I'm shocked at the image quality difference from my old 5D I bought 4 years ago.  I'm kicking myself for not buying this earlier.  Color fidelity, contrast, sharpness, color balance, focusing all better.  I'm surprised that the extra resolution really did help.  The large files have a lot of headroom for mistakes.While most reviews for this type of item are rationalizing a large purchase, here it goes anyway.  When I first purchased the camera, I had cold feet and was ready to return because of the price.  But after 2 months, I would buy it again even if I broke it.Alternatives are really overrated.  Nikon has a far more aggressive marketing team than in the past that exaggerates differences, so take what you read with a grain of salt.  Lots of people are drinking Nikon Kool-Aid right now and defend them to the death.  Overall Canon is a better SYSTEM, although I openly admit things I like better about Nikon: button layout, viewfinder, body design, built in infrared flash control, built in flash, and the 14-24mm lens.  But other things: low resolution alternatives, poor third party support (pocketwizard and adobe raw), overprices lenses with no midprice alternatives, poor video or no video, etc.  For instance, Canon makes a 17-40L for much less than the 16-35L.  A 70-200 4 IS or no IS, 70-200 2.8 IS or no IS.  Nikon only makes the expensive versions, which is why I always see Nikon owners with cheap lenses or mid-prices Sigma Lenses.  Canon owners almost always have Canon lenses.  Anyway:Pros:-Outrageous RAW headroom for mistakes, far beyond the 5Dmk1.  In outdoor portraits with strobes, I can still get a high quality images when the strobes don't fire and leave me with a -2ev shot.  When making outrageous changes in Photoshop, files respond beautifully.  RAW files are monstrous, however.- Picture quality out of camera saves serious time in photoshop.- The screen is finally useful in judging exposure.  You can clearly see if the skin tones are over and under exposed, hotspots in a poor lighting setup, etc.  You'll still see more detail in shadows on the computer, however.- ISO sensitivity: one of the best today.  I shot out of a car window at twilight in a spooky looking town and got amazing shots at 6400+.  I shoot more for fun since I've had this camera.-Great customization and cool menu controls.-I laughed at video but am starting to use it regularly at weddings.  Amazing quality of expensive video cameras.  Tricky to learn with autofocus.  Must use a tripod.- Even more detail out of my lenses (except 100-400)- Everything improved from old 5D- Much better image quality than 1Ds Mkii and iii.- Canon lenses a much better value than Nikon.Cons- MINUS ONE STAR - second position of power switch was broke when arrived, so I couldn't use any manual features.  Had to order a new one.-Pre-planned obsolescence; just look at the 7D with built in speedlight control, extra video switch, auto-focus system, pitch-leveler, 1.0 viewfilder, etc.  The sensor on this thing is still WAY better, and I needed another camera body now.  But, it has features such as video that are way ahead of the competition.- File size is getting ludicrous, especially when you need to export to TIFF, but WORTH IT.  Unlike 7D and others, however, that extra file size actually has way more detail.  Other high MP cameras can't justify their file sizes.  sRaw not much smaller.-My 100-400mm L Canon lens cannot keep up with this high mp, full frame camera.  Your worst glass will look REALLY BAD  with this camera.  Even sigma lenses look better.  Looks much better on an APS-C.-I still sometimes miss the focusing system on my old 20D.  Maybe I'll buy a 7D for bird shooting.  People really exaggerate the differences in focusing systems, but it honestly could use improvement.-Viewfinder not as good as Nikon's or Canon 7D.Notes: shoots with 17-40 4L, 24-70 2.8L, 70-200mm 2.8 IS L, 100-400mm L, Lensbaby, Sigma 12-24mm fullframe,", "Date": "November 12, 2009"}, {"Title": "Bought this again, rather than the Mark III", "Author": "M.

I went with the Mark II again, and here is why:1. Even though the Mark III has 51 Auto Focus points, vs the 9 points on the Mark II, I use the center focus anyway, so that was not important.2. Mark III has 6 fps, vs 3.9 on the Mark II. This is not important to me either, since I don't shoot sports, or things I need that type of burst rate.3. 1.2 more megapixels per shot. No biggie, since I already shoot at medium size raw files. I'm not sure how many people actually shoot at 21, but I hope they have large externals! lol4. Mark III has better video capabilities.  Since I don't use my camera as a camcorder, (and I can't imagine doing it anyway, but I'll probably end up doing so, since that's how it goes when I'm like, \"Why would anyone do that...\") it nothing to me.5. You can now do HDR with the Mark III. Nothing special to me, since I use NIK HDR anyway, and on top of that, I can handhold the Mark II for the 3 shot exposure and do just fine without alignment problems. I used to be so careful to always use a tripod and move to manual focus after setting focus, but now I see it's a waste of time. Anyway, no need for HDR for me.6. A much higher ISO with the Mark III. But again, I rarely shoot over 800 ISO; and the bad news for the Mark III is that there is no difference in noise from the Mark II to the Mark III at up to 800 ISO.7. You are going to pay $1300 more for the Mark III, and if you are in my shoes, get no better camera.

To my surprise even without a grip it felt better for some reason. The viewfinder is sooooo much better. I was aware of some other changes with the CMOS sensor.

I've owned the Pentax K20D, K200D, Canon 40D, Nikon D90, D300 (twice), D700 (thrice), Sony A850, Olympus E-5, Canon 1D3 and now the Canon 5D2, all with associated lenses and flashes over the short course of three years!  All great systems, each with their strengths and weaknesses.That said, I finally found my home in the 5D2 because I settled on what I like to shoot and I liked the *specific* features the 5D2 give me.First, let's get it out of the way - the 5D2 is not, and never will be, a Nikon D700 when it comes to autofocus performance - The D700 is a great overall camera, suitable for pretty much any type of photography except really candid / quiet settings because its mirror slap is like a small robot clapping (pretty loud).The 5D2's AF performance is pretty good at the central point.  I use the 24-105 f/4 (great lens), the 85 f/1.8 and a Zeiss 35 f/2, and for the AF lenses I've never really had much of a problem with either the central point or the outer points in decent light.  In lower light, I have to use the central point.  Many people complain from this because one either has to use focus-recompose or shoot centrally (and wider) and crop.  Both methods doable, and both methods imperfect.  Frankly, it really doesn't bother me, but coming from owning the D700 I know the feeling of great AF.Instead of repeating everything about great image quality, lots of MP for cheap, etc. I'll just list some things I think the 5D2 does better than the D700, which is still the camera it's most compared against.5D2:- Has custom modes right on the dial.  Frankly, I love how they work and I really dislike custom settings on the D700.  Whereas Canon lets you register custom settings and quickly turn to them, Nikon makes you register basically two different banks of settings and you'd better remember which bank you need to switch to to modify which parameter.  Also, the D700 has the annoying habit of \"auto-updating\" the bank if you happen to change a setting, whereas the Canon reverts to the bank's last-registered settings if you happen to temporarily change something then switch modes.- Does Live View the right stinking way.  With Canon, if you're in Live View and you press the shutter - the shutter actually exposes the image and you're back to LV...no mirror slap (unless you're using flash).  The D700?  Forget it, no matter what you do, you're greeted with mirror slap.  This is HIGHLY ANNOYING to a landscaper or macro photographer!  Essentially with the D700's LV you're limited to using it as a focus aid and that's it - MLU is a separate mode on the dial, so you're going to induce mirror slap movement on some shots.To further this, Canon does a great job on their LV when combined with bracketing.  It's nearly the perfect setup for doing tripod-based HDR (except for being limited to only 3 shots, but so far that's enough for me).  Basically, place the camera in 2-sec timer mode, bracketing (I use 3 shots at -2,0-+2 EV).  I register this on a custom mode.  Now, when I enter Live view and after framing, I press the shutter, the camera counts 2 sec then gracefully takes three exposures with no mirror slap - Awesome!- Loads of MP - I've been amazed at how much I've cropped into some images and still result in more MP (or slightly less) than a full, uncropped D700 image.- Beautiful video - After using the D90 video for a while, frankly I wasn't expecting too much until I viewed some sample 5D2 video - looks AWESOME.  I only care about video for my kids, but it's nice to have amazing high quality video in the camera.- Silent shooting modes.  They really help you \"disappear\" into the crowd, instead of walking around like the clapping robot that the D700 sounds like :D  A nice side bonus.- Smaller RAW files - Want the flexibility of RAW without the size?  Go with SRAW for a 10MP image! Great for \"around the house\" shots, in case you come up with something awesome (accidental great shots with two young kids are possible) and need the editing leeway but don't want to fill your memory card with huge RAW files.Don't get me wrong, I love the D700 - Great AF performance and customization, great great flash system and commander built-in, faster available FPS, a bit higher ISO performance (not much), and the AF points cover a bit more of the frame I believe.But, for what I like to shoot, Canon has the lenses I like (24-105 IMO beats any of Nikon's FF walk-arounds and the 85 f/1.8 Canon is definitely better than the Nikon variant) and the 5D2 gives me superb image quality and performance.  Highly recommended.  I deducted 1 star from the camera because of its sub-standard AF, lack of built-in viewfinder shutter, bracketing exposure limitations and other small faults, but it's still a highly-recommended camera for its intended purpose.", "Date": "May 17, 2011"}, {"Title": "The Best DSLR So Far", "Author": "James M. Brown", "ReviewID": "R2KICPMO6OF5XO", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "The 5D Mark II represents the future of digital SLR photography/videography. I was fortunate to purchase my kit with the EF 24-105 f/4L at its actual list price of $3,499 through Amazon and sold by 6 Ave Electronics on December 29, 2008. That offer was only available for about 6 hours. Now that I have used the camera for 6 months, I would even now pay a significant premium over the list price to have it. In my opinion it is worth much more than the list price in terms of advancements in low-light, low-noise and quick exposure setting features. It also has markedly improved picture quality over all other Canon DSLRs with the exception of the 1Ds Mark III ($7,000 street) which it at least matches.This camera isn't perfect. The 5D Mark II does have a lower frame rate than some other very fine cameras at 3.9 frames per second. Nevertheless, this frame rate has been fine for my purposes, including wildlife and bird photography. I am able to catch hummingbirds in flight. Unless you are a professional sports or action photographer there is simply no need to consider the much more expensive 1 series camera bodies.I would have preferred more focus points than the 9 visible and 6 invisible points this camera provides, though in normal lighting conditions there has been no problem getting fast, accurate focus. In very low light where the shot requires an ISO of 3200 or 6400 and no flash, the camera does sometimes have trouble, especially with moving or flat, low-contrast subjects. But considering that we wouldn't even be able to get an essentially noise-free image with another camera at these settings it seems a small criticism.This camera also lacks an internal flash. Some people may feel this to be a loss, but with the extraordinary low-light capability of the 5D Mark II I haven't missed this feature at all. When I want to use a flash I can easily attach one, and that seems to be a rare event now. The ability to capture low light images without the exposure problems flash often causes is an enormous improvement for me. And when I need a flash I always have my 580 EX II available, though it does add some weight to this body.The high resolution of this camera will show up flaws in any attached lens. Thus, you are going to have to use high quality glass to get the most out of the body. Those who are not able or willing to make an investment in \"L\" quality lenses would probably be just as happy with a 50D or similar bodies from other manufacturers. On the other hand, this camera's ability to register most Canon lenses and eliminate problems like peripheral illumination has proven remarkable during my use.Notably, there are many other improvements over the original 5D, which was a wonderful camera that many people would still be very happy with. The Mark II's new display is outstanding; while a few other cameras now offer the same 3 inch high resolution LCD, the new display allows the user to enlarge the image enough to get a very good idea of what the final image will look like in print. When using auto ISO settings the camera makes very good choices to capture the best image possible. In fact, the algorithms this camera's DIGIC 4 processor uses for all its settings seem superior to any of the others I have looked at. And if you don't like the choices the camera makes, it is completely customizable, including 3 user settings on the main control knob.Then too, you do have to read the manual and take time to learn the many controls and settings that are available. I am convinced that several of the negative reviews on this site are simply the result of not understanding the full capabilities of this camera. For example comments about the \"sharpness\" of photos fail to take into account that the camera comes with certain sharpness settings by default, but that these can be changed and images sharpened to an almost garish degree. Other comments about supposed failings of different portrait mode settings or white balance adjustments likewise seem not to recognize that nearly every setting on this camera can be modified to match the operator's desires. This is a highly advanced instrument which requires some study before taking it out into the field.One way to judge a camera body is by the people who choose to use it. The outstanding professional photographer and professor of photography, Pete Souza was named official Whitehouse photographer earlier this year; his history-making first digital official Presidential portrait of President Obama was made using a 5D Mark II. Numerous photo journalists, wedding and event photographers and others who make their living with their equipment are using 5D Mark II bodies. I am also seeing this camera being used more and more by sports photographers, despite its 3.9 fps rate.I have said nothing about the video capability. This was not a reason for my purchase, but I have been impressed by the quality of the videos this camera produces. I did not at first recognize what a game changer high def video capability in an SLR would become. It is interesting that Canon has now issued a firmware upgrade to allow full manual exposure control during videography which in my experience works very well. You must, however, have a good quality computer with a fast processor and high end video card to be able to edit the high def output.Like any other camera, there are a few small things Canon could have done to make this an even more remarkable improvement over the original 5D. But taken as a whole, for my money this is far and away the best, most feature rich and useable DSLR available for professional and serious photographers.", "Date": "June 29, 2009"}, {"Title": "So close to the perfect camera", "Author": "J. Howell", "ReviewID": "R3FF15ICSGXG50", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I've been using a 5D Mark II since it's introduction back in late 2008.  I preordered one as soon as it was available and have been using it since the beginning for wedding and portraits.  I've used this camera along side the original 5D and 1Ds Mark II.  I've also loaned a 1Ds Mark III on occasion.After extensive experience with this camera as well as lower end cameras and higher end cameras, my summary of the 5D Mark II is that they almost had a perfect camera.  This camera is like the superstar athlete with a bum knee.  The bum knee in this case is the focusing system.  In order to protect sales of their higher end cameras, Canon intentionally held back the focusing capabilities of this camera relative to its higher end offerings.  The focusing system is basically the same 9 point AF system as the original 5D had (which is the same as the 30D AF), only with faster hardware.  The digic 4 processor will calculate focus predictions quicker than the previous 5D.  The AF hardware is limited though and no more accurate than the 5D that came before it.  For a $2500 camera this is very disappointing.The focusing system will give you the most trouble in these situations:- Using fast aperture lenses (F1.4 or so)- Using the outer focusing points- Using AI servo to track subjectsThe focusing system will give you the least trouble in these situations:- Using slower lenses- Using the center focus point- Using one-shot auto focusingSo the wildly varying opinions on this camera's focusing system exist because different users use the camera in different ways.  Some users will love the focusing performance while others will loathe it.  Odds are, they are both justified opinions.That said, this focusing system is better than any Canon camera costing less.  If are you upgrading from any digital rebel or 10 series body (10D, 20D, 40D, etc), you will NOT be disappointed here.  If you are using this as a second body to your 1-series camera, the focusing system will be a bit of a letdown.  Remember that this camera costs about $2000 less than a current generation 1D camera.Now with that caveat out of the way, there is VERY little to pick at with this camera. Image quality is stunning (on par with the $7000 1Ds Mark III).  Noise is low across the board.  Even at higher ISOs (3200-6400), it cleans up very well in Adobe Lightroom and is very usable.  H1 (12,800) and H2 (25,600) are mainly for \"show\" and are pretty bad.  At lower ISOs, noise is exceptionally low and the images are sharp and clean.  Even almost 4 years after its introduction, this camera is still has the best image quality money can buy for $2500 and that is saying a LOT.Functionally the camera is excellent.  In-camera processing and image review is VERY quick (high speed CF cards recommended).  Menus are accessible and easy to understand.  Microadjustment makes ill focusing lenses far less problematic.  HD video is beautiful and great for *basic* video needs (advanced videographers might look elsewhere).  Build and durability is generally very good, though I wouldn't recommend dropping it. I've dropped mine twice (broke something both times) and had it repaired.  Today it runs like a champ though.  The automatic sensor cleaning generally works good, though I would recommend picking up a bulb blower for the stubborn particles.As a professional tool, this is an exceptional camera, just be aware of the limitations of the focusing system.  Overall though Canon did an awesome job with this camera.  Nearly 4 years after it's introduction, it's still the tool of choice for many professionals.", "Date": "October 20, 2011"}, {"Title": "So far so good.", "Author": "Carbonadam \"Ladies and gentleman, I hope that...", "ReviewID": "R1I5RV3WNJF5FF", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "The dreaded \"black dot\" phenomenon that I keep reading about does not seem to be happening to me. I have tried to duplicate it and have had, well, good luck. Duplicating the black dots in low light high ISO conditions with pinpoints of light would be bad luck. For those of you out there who have this, I am sorry. I have had many lemon products in my life. I think my karma for that has hopefully run out till my next life.So far the camera is performing as expected which is amazing. I have jumped from measly 20D to this and I am amazed at the leap. i am also very glad I waited. I almost bought a 5D months ago and all the props here has to go to my brother, who soundly instructed me to wait it out. And wait I did. I ordered the camera in November and got it only a few days before Christmas. Quite a present.Of course you need a few good lenses with this camera to capture it's full essence. My old EF-S lenses fro my 20 D are NOT compatible. Heed this warning people. Move to the Canon L series lenses. Hopefully they will last a lifetime. I am not sure when, if ever I will need another SLR. 21 megapixels is quite a lot. I am sure at some point there will be 500, 800, 1000, even several thousand megapixels. lets just hope I can use my eyes as lenses then and plug the memory card to my head to download the images. For now I am set with this.The screen is a vast improvement over the 20D which was almost a measly after thought. I have bigger screens on tiny point and shoot cameras. It also has live view which comes in handy. The digital video is flawless, although I have not figured out how to do autofocus with it yet. It may not be able to, which would seem odd to me. The video is a bonus for me but autofocus for it seems an obvious necessity.I did almost drop it while attaching it to a new tripod. God was smiling at me as I did catch it. Be careful! It is like a small fortune for this thing.One final note... Do not buy the camera for this price. It sells for around $3500.00 with the 28-105 l series lens. I am not sure how these jokers think they can sell for this much and I would love to hear from anyone who paid this much.Remember the body sells for about $2500.00.

For an even more comprehensive one, I would refer you to the website DPReview.After thinking about this camera for 6 months, I finally convinced myself to buy it. I am not regretting the decision at all. This is an excellent camera for my needs and the picture quality and resolution from its 21 megapixel sensor is simply mind boggling. In my mind, the main advantage of all those megapixels is the ability to do an extensive crop without sacrificing the image quality. I owned a 30D and if I crop files from it just a little bit, the sharpness suffers.Let me now talk about the high ISO performance of the 5D Mark II. It is definitely amazing. Different people have different tolerances as far as image noise but for me it is excellent up to ISO 1600. I went to an indoor place with Christmas lights display and shot ISO 3200 and I was still happy with the results. I did have to clean up half of the files with the Noise Ninja software. But guess what, the files clean up very easily with the noise reduction software. Images from my 30D did not clean up as easily.The only reason why I did not give this camera 5 stars is because of its autofocus (AF) system. Now, I mainly shoot portraits and nature. I don't do much sports. And for subjects that are father away, I mainly use the center AF which is extremely adequate. However, when I shoot portraits at closer distances and shallow apertures, I like using specific AF points (to avoid blur). In these instances, I can't help but feel that there should be more focus points.How about using the camera for moving subjects? I don't think it was designed to be a sports camera. It can take 4 frames per second which I don't think is very adequate. Although I've seen pictures from very talented photographers from DPReview take amazing pictures of birds in flight with this camera so it can be done. (Google \"liquidstone pbase\" and you will be amazed.)While I love this camera and will use it for many years, I advice you to also read about the alternatives. I will list them below.If you are a Canon user and have Canon lenses, another alternative is the 7D. The 7D is not a full frame camera but an APS-C (cropped sensor) camera. The 7D is superior to the 5D in terms of its autofocus system (faster frame rate, more sensitive AF points, and more AF points) and features (better LCD, bigger viewfinder, electronic grid, customizable buttons) but inferior to the 5D in terms of image quality and ISO performance.If you are starting from scratch or if you are willing to switch, you also should consider the Nikon D700. As far as image quality and high ISO performance, I think both cameras are at par. Canon is superior in terms of having a higher resolution (21 vs 12 megapixels) and 1080p video. But Nikon is superior in terms of build quality, weather sealing, and autofocus system. The D700's autofocus system is really more advanced than the 5D2's. It has 51 AF points (15 of which are the more sensitive cross-type kind) and a frame rate of 5 FPS without the battery grip and 8 FPS with the grip.So which should you buy, the D700 or the 5D Mark II? If you will use the camera mainly for sports, then you should definitely go for the D700. Otherwise, it's a matter of preference. If you prefer a higher resolution camera with 1080p video, go for the 5D Mark II. If you prefer a more robust camera with excellent weather sealing and a pro-autofocus, then go for the D700.", "Date": "January 3, 2010"}, {"Title": "Which HDMI cable to choose", "Author": "Sean Thomas Brady", "ReviewID": "R2XFS9LNOT7YBJ", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "The 5D instruction manual says that \"The HDMI Cable HTC-100 (sold separately) is required\" to connect to the 5D to an HDMI monitor/TV.That cable goes for $69.  I bought the Mediabridge 5ft Mini-HDMI to HDMI Version 1.3b Category 2 for only $12 and it works fine.I think (maybe someone can verify this) that any 1.3b mini HDMI to HDMI cable will work just fine.By the way, the camera is awesome.  I have had it for a few days now and I love it.  It shoots beautiful pictures at 3200 ISO, so there's really no need for a flash.  And it shoots usable (but noisy) photos at 25,600 ISO.That's the end of the review.  Now a bit of advice on buying this camera:My advice (for what it's worth) is don't overpay just to have this camera a few weeks early.  You're going to be using this thing for 5 years, so whether you get it in January or February doesn't make a big difference.  I was lucky enough to buy it (in kit form) from Amazon directly and not from some unknown electronics store.Whatever you do, avoid J&R; in New York.

Nonetheless, I longed for the 5D Mark II forever and finally convinced my wife to justify the purchase. (I told her it helps me take better pictures, but who doesn't?) My wife reluctantly agreed and we took a deep plunge to purchase this with the 24-105mm f/4 L IS lens kit. Shipping from Amazon was fast as usual and upon opening the box, I felt the golden glow around the new device. Immediately I attached the lens and took a few test shots. Upon looking through the viewfinder, I noticed a very big difference. The viewfinder was large and bright as the viewfinder from the T1i or the T3i even didn't come close. Shutter noise sounds much subdued (and better) when compared to the T1i and T3i. I will not go in to technical details as the other reviewers have done that.The construction is solid and I felt right at home with the controls. Although I am used to the directional buttons on the right side of the LCD display on the Rebel series, I felt right at home with the Quick Dial and joystick. The ON/OFF/L switch takes some getting used to as the Rebel series has the on-off lever right next to the Main Settings Dial. The screen is the same as the Rebel T1i as so it seems. The metal construction blows the Rebels out of the water. Lack of a pop up flash is a con, but I really didn't use the pop up flash on the Rebels anyway so it really doesn't bother me.The main things I love about this camera is the amazing build quality, full frame, large and bright viewfinder and the pictures the L lens takes. The camera is nice and large and is perfect for my big hands. The most amazing feature is the amazing image quality. The image quality has blown me away and this camera can do amazing things like shoot in low light, produce amazing bokeh even with the f/4 and the IS helps to reduce camera shake. The top LCD is SO convenient as I have been using Rebels without it. However, the most satisfying aspect of owning this camera is that people around you notice it and ask you about it. Either way, you purchased this camera to take great pictures and be envied!Believe me, I probably read all the reviews before I pulled the trigger and debated for months before finally deciding to take the plunge. I was torn between the 7D and the 5D Mark II for a very long time and I decided to go with the 5D Mark II because of the Full Frame although the 7D was MUCH newer and contained newer technology. For the type of photography I do, the 5D was perfect for me as I didn't have a need for a 19point AF system or a need for a blazing continuous speed shooting. What decidedly got me to get the 5D Mark II was Kai W's review on Digital Rev TV and boy am I glad I did.PROS:+Amazing build quality/construction+Image quality+High ISO capability+Full Frame+Comes with L lens!+It's a 5D Mark II! What's there not to like?CONS:-Price (but all the features make this camera a worthwhile purchase)I have bought the BG-E6 Battery Grip, Extra LP-E6 Battery Pack, B+W Haze MC Filter 77mm and a EF 70-200mm IS f/2.8 II L (will have a review for that soon) to compliment the Mark II.

My 40D with Canon's excellent 24-105L F4 lens has taken some terrific shots, but I really needed the low light and extra resolution of the 5D to make my photographic work really pop. I've been doing a lot of portrait work recently and finally decided to spring for the 5D to get the best possible shots for my clients.The result: I'm blown away with the quality of the shots. It's hard to take a bad photo with this camera. Everything comes out looking like an image from National Geographic or Architectural Digest magazines! Its wonderful to finally be able to use the actual 24mm end of my 24-105 lens (without the 1.6X factor of the 40D). Interiors shot using existing light without flash come out sharp and wonderful with great saturation and contrast. The image preview screen on the back of the camera is a vast improvement over the 40D, with a higher pixel count and excellent display.My confidence as a photographer has come way up since owning the 5D. I've been shooting professionally since the mid 1970's with film cameras (Nikon FE2), then went digital in the 90's with an Olympus E10 (great in its 4 megapixel day), then the 40D and finally a camera that blows them all away: the 5D.

Newcomer \"Photography Junkie\"", "ReviewID": "RAD6R0AQ2VVH5", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This camera was an upgrade from the original Canon EOS 5D 12.8 MP Digital SLR Camera (Body Only) which I loved.  I never thought the image quality could be improved upon enough to warrant $2,500 to upgrade, but I was wrong.  It was still painful to plop down this much money since I am only a serious amateur, but it turned out to be SO worth it.  I'm not ready to completely give up my old 5D though and still use it as a 2nd camera body.First off, the image quality has to be seen to be believed when coupled with \"L\" quality lenses (non-L lenses will show numerous flaws).  Low light performance alone makes the upgrade worth it:  Virtually noise-free up until ISO 800 (barely noticeable), starting around ISO 1000 (acceptable) and really doesn't become bothersome until around ISO 4000 or so.  If you use a good noise control program like Noise Ninja or others,  you can get away with even higher ISO's.I coupled this camera with a Lexar Professional Series 16 GB 300x UDMA CompactFlash Memory Card CF16GB-300-381 and the write speed is almost instant, even though the camera is moving 20+ MB of data with each shot.  I would recommend a card reader though, because going directly from camera to computer can be slow.The new menu system is 100 times better than the old one, very easy to go from tab-to-tab rather than all the scrolling of the old menu system, and you can find your selection much faster.  The true VGA LCD screen on the back is a VERY welcome change.  Larger and brighter, you'll notice it self-adjust the brightness when you're outside too.  Live-view is awesome!  I've been using it in my macro and studio work for razor sharpness and it's made my poor eyes much happier than all the squinting.  I had a pirate eye-patch for doing that work with my old 5D.The dust-reducing facilites are another welcome change.  I had to clean my sensor before every important shoot with the old model.  I've had the 5D MK II for about 3 months now and have yet to clean the sensor on it.  Dust will still adhere to the underside of the focusing screen, but easily blown off with your Giottos AA1900 Rocket Air Blaster Large (Black).Finally the resolution.  I've been able to take wildlife shots at some distance, and crop out the subject and still have a superior quality photo.  It's really added a lot of flexibility for composition in post-production.  I have successfully printed up to 24x36 with absolutely no distortion at all using Alien Skin's Blow-UP 2 Software.  It's my belief you could easily do a perfect 11x14 or 12x18 straight out of the camera though.Some people love the Digital Photo Professional software that comes with it, but my personal preference is Photoshop.  Note that if you're still using CS3 or before you will need to convert the CR2's from the 5D MK II using Adobe's DNG converter (free download from Adobe) or upgrade to at least CS4.I am currently using this camera with the optional Canon BG-E6 Battery Grip for Canon 5D Mark II Digital SLR and 2 batteries in the grip.  Battery life with this combination is amazing.  I can easily go weeks between charges, and an easy menu on the camera gives detail on battery life.  The incremental battery life indicator on the top window is a lot more accurate than the old 5D.It's just my preference but I disagree with the reviewers who say there should be a pop-up flash on camera.  This camera is pro level quality and as any serious amateur or pro will tell you, built-in flashes are useless.  In combination with my Canon Speedlite 580EX II Flash for Canon EOS Digital SLR Cameras it's a winning combination for flawless flash photographs with no red-eye and no harsh shadows when bounced.  If you're going to spend this much on a camera, a good speedlight is a must.The latest firmware version  2.0.4 fixes some bugs and improves movie performance so if your new model doesn't have that version, it's a free download from Canon.  I do not have experience with movie mode yet, so I will update this review later on that.I'm still have a bit of sticker-shock, but after using this camera awhile, it seems more an investment.

In this regard, I would say the 5D 2 is the way to go because of increased ISO sensitivity, higher resolution, etc etc.VIDEO?PLEASE do not buy this camera because of the video because you will most assuredly be disappointed. I too was wowed by watching the various videos circulating on the web... but beware that the best quality video is that taken with fast prime lenses (e.g. max aperture f 1.4). The camera in indoor lighting often prefers to open the aperture wide allowing more light in... sounds great... problem is that its all manual focus.. so you have a paper thin depth of field.. which can create artistic effects, but for any real home video, you would spend all your time concentrating on focusing back and forth. If you are the type of person who is interested enough to spend a lot of time and effort to create short video clips (e.g. commercials etc), then this is nice... but if you're thinking, great, I won't need my camcorder... you're going to have one sore focusing finger.Not only that, I used to think the rolling shutter artifact was just people whining.. beware that it is not a minor artifact that bothers videophiles, it is a very real strange video artifact that can sometimes be very distracting and it can be present not just in panning, but also on still video.Shutter is still loud as hell, same as the 5D 1. AF is still very obsolete, like the 5D 1.That said, it is a great camera with wonderful quality, excellent resolution, and if you are a Canon guy/gal, you want this.----If you are NOT a Canon guy/gal, consider the alternative. The Nikon D700. The advantage of the D700 is primarily in the greater more sophisticated 51 point 3d autofocus, which is essential for taking pics of moving objects well, such as kids. Even the most advanced camera in the world will be ridiculed if it can't focus well (ahem, 1d mark iii initially).Problems with the D700, choice of lenses is somewhat less than for Canon but obviously there are still plenty of lenses to choose from.. no video, that is minor since the video from the 5dii is not tremendously easy or useful.PROS 5D II:High megapixel for printing large postersStunning HD Video when its goodWide choice of lensesCONS 5D II:HD video difficult to use due to manual focus, all other settings autoLoud shutter, hard to blend into background when shutter is that obnoxiousAF horribly obsolete, same as old 5D, shame on you CanonPROS D700:Advanced modern AF, same as on top modelsQuiet shutterReviews show better build quality and better ergonomics (I find both to be  almost equal though)CONS D700:Lens choices slightly less\"Only\" 12 megapixel, only problematic for very large postersNo video-------------------In the end, I returned the 5D mark ii and bought a D700 because I take pictures of live moving subjects, and AF is crucial. I have been very pleased.Picture quality of both cameras is equal (given that they are in focus). Before buying, please read other web reviews regarding 5DII ability to autofocus.UPDATE 8/2011After looking at a lot of the comments I decided I needed to clarify some things that may have been ambiguous.1. VIDEOMy comments above speak to the average person who does not shoot for a living and is not taking video of carefully scripted situations, and is not willing to spend a lot of time to produce small clips of video. I assumed pros don't really read Amazon reviews anyway, the intended audience is the average homeowner like myself who is a camera enthusiast and may have thought that it could replace a camcorder for home video (which we all agree, it cannot).2. SHUTTER NOISEThis is obviously a very subjective thing. One common praise for Leica cameras is how \"sexy\" the shutter sounds. The D700 is no Leica, but the 5DII is at least double or triple the noise level (my subjective evaluation). Will a pro care, of course not. Why the heck would a pro read my review anyway? This was a very minor point that I had not seen mentioned in other reviews, and I thought it worth mentioning.3. AUTOFOCUSI have to say, after a couple years of shooting the D700, even though it's autofocus is far more advanced than the 5D1 or 2, e.g. 3D continuous tracking, I still tend to shoot and recompose with just the single point focus 80-90% of the time. When shooting older kids adults and inanimate things, this is especially the case. When shooting at 1.4, I'm also tending to even go for manual focus when possible... so while the extra abilities are definitely nice to have, they aren't quite as important as I originally thought they would be.", "Date": "March 26, 2009"}, {"Title": "Review from an enthusiast", "Author": "TYZ", "ReviewID": "R1DDE2GUA7MU1H", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I am an enthusiast photographer.  I understand the relationship between aperture, shutter and ISO; I understand the basics of composition, rules of thirds and all that; watches youtube constantly and try to learn more; and I process my RAW in Lightroom because I am not a professional and just a bit lazy to learn layers and Photoshop.I am budget conscious, not rich or anything.  Therefore it is a bit hard for me to justify buying over 3000 dollars of equipment for mainly weekend and vacation shooting.  I've used it for almost 2 weeks and I would say overall I don't regret buying it.  I will list some pros and cons from my perspective.Pros:A lot of detail is available from the RAW files.  A bit of brushing and those blown out while sky comes back to life easily.  Just tweaking with LR, I can get those HDR looking photos where everywhere is exposed without doing bracketing.  Its not perfect HDR of course, but pretty good and amazing in my opinion.  And of course, the details in the images are very crisp, a big upgrade from my old camera.The rate of 3.9 is pretty good in my opinion.  I use a 600x card and shoot RAW only; the camera shows 13 shots continuously at that rate before clogging, which is pretty good.The weight of the camera makes shooting at slower shutter speed easier.  When I was hand holding my old camera(I rather not say model), I usually have bluish image at 1/15, but this one seems to do it pretty well.  Some people probably can hand hold 1/15 easily with any camera, but this is just something I noticed.  I think the extra weight gave me this extra stability or maybe there is something going on inside.Knowing that this is a Full Frame camera with the ability to capture pretty much the best quality images is satisfying.  I travel whenever my finance allow, and some of the destinations I probably will never go again or just simply change from time to time.  Therefore the biggest justification for myself buying this camera is to be able to capture images without later regrets.  Before, I had images with the sky fully blown out or the face of my subject poorly lit and by recovering from LR, I just loose a lot of detail and make everything look unpleasant. Professionals probably can shoot better I know, but I am not pro and the comfort of not paying so much for  my mistakes and no regrets is the main reason I am happy with my decision.now onto the Cons:Like everyone said, the focus is the downside of 5DII.  Maybe I am overshadowed by all the other reviews; but from what I feel, I just think its a bit slow, more noticeable during darker situations.  I have not used a lot of cameras so maybe I am just nit-picking.  When I mount the 50mm 1.4 on the 5DII, the focus is a bit slow, and also the minimal focus distance for the 50mm 1.4 is quiet long at 0.45m.  I was inside a museum, and sometimes I'm just too close to the subject, or sometimes its just too dark, so the focusing seems to be confused once in awhile.  I don't have anything technical to back this up, just my feeling.  The lack of focus point don't bother me at all since I only use the central one and rarely shoot birds or sports.  Its not a problem when I'm outside, I hardly notice it, but when I do, it bothers me.The weight adds stability while shooting, but is definitely not good for walking.  Having this magnesium alloy brick hanging on my neck without support is not pleasant.Shutter is a bit loud and lower pitch.  I think each and everyone have a different preference for shutter sound.  I actually like the sound of short higher pitch, for example the Rebels.Vignette and Light fall off.  Coming from a cropped, the vignetting and light falls off at the corners is much more noticeable.  I know different lens behaves differently, but this is definitely more noticeable.Build-in Mic is nearly useless during recording.  It is very noisy.  Even if you want to record something simple, the quality of sound coming out of the mic makes me mute it all together.The large megapixel makes my Lightroom 4.1 a lot slower.  I have an Acer Laptop, i5-2410, 8GB Ram, Nvidia Geforce GT540M laptop.  No SSD, just regular 640GB, 5400RPM Hard drive.  The laptop is not something blazing fast, but I had no problem with 10 Megapixel RAW files.  Now the full 21 Megapixel RAW files from 5DII are making my LR a lot slower.  I already rooted my comp to clean out the bloatwares and tried to render 1:1 when importing and all the other tweaks I can find on the internet but it is still quiet slow.  It is noticeably slow while editing (applying different presets and brushing) and slow when exporting.  Its not anything bad for the camera, but something every buyer should consider, as I am now planning to dropping more money to buy a better desktop.Recommendations:I think for those non-professionals, this is probably the best pick for the money.  The new 5DIII is obviously better, but the price is a big factor for me.  For people who have the money, buy it; but I don't, so I rather save that extra dollars and spend it on a vacation.  The focus is good enough in my opinion, probably because I don't shoot sports or things that are moving like crazy.  All the other nitpicks such as power switch position, dop preview position, slow rate are completely irrelevant in my opinion.  5DII is a solid camera, and I think its best buy for the money since the ability to produce good image is the most important factor.For those who wants to buy a full frame, I would say make sure you know why you want to buy it.  The desire of getting better gear is always with us, and I recommend for anyone buying anything really, make sure you justify your purchase.  Please don't buy a good camera like this and simply put it away in your closet after the first few month.  It pains budget conscious people like me who have invested so much time to find the best pick.  If you have the extra cash, knows that photography requires lots of hard work, and want to advance in photography, I would say its worth it.", "Date": "July 16, 2012"}, {"Title": "Prices too good to be true!!", "Author": "D.

There are now three full-frame DSLRs under $3000 (currentgeneration): Canon 5D Mark II, Nikon D700, Sony a900. There are pros and cons for each system, which I will briefly go over.Canon 5D Mark IIPros:-Has 1080p/FullHD video recording - Google examples. They will prove the FullHD video is not a gimmick.-21.1MP-Has the most selection of lenses (both for consumer and pro grade)-Very good high-ISO noise handling even with such a large resolution - nearly as good at 100% as the D700/D3, but with 75% more pixels-Lowest MSRP, which may translate to the lowest street price in a few monthsCons:-Least amount of AF points - but they appear to be more than adequate for nearly any situation-Only shoots 3.9fps - the slowest of the threeNikon D700Pros:-Cheapest street price as of 12/2008-51 AF points and fast AF-5fps-Very good noise handling in large part because it has the lowest resolution-8fps (with battery grip) - fastest continuous shootingCons:-\"Only\" 12MP - However, 12MP is more than adequate for nearly everything, so I am only listing it as a con purely based on specs. But it issomewhat of a limitation if you want to make really big prints.-Smallest viewfinderSony a900Pros:-Highest resolution at 24MP-Image Stabilization built into the body-Zeiss lenses-100% viewfinder-5fpsCons:-Least amount of lens selection-Bad noise control by far compared to other two - by several stpos-Highest street priceBasically it'd be hard to go wrong with any of the systems, and things are only looking up for consumers as technology gets better and better.This is an excellent camera, and I wholeheartedly recommend it to anyone who is looking to upgrade or get into the hobby. You won't bedisappointed...I still need to play around with my camera more before I can give a more in-depth review, but I am very impressed. Noise handling is really great,and even shots at ISO 12800 and 25600 are easily usable, especially at normal print sizes.

Though not leaps and bounds over the 7D in image quality, the 5D Mark II does produce noticably better photos (at least to my eye).  Going from a cropped sensor to full frame did take a little getting use to, as vignetting, etc. did become far more pronounced.  However, Lightroom 3 provides an easy fix for that.I've been using the 5D Mark II mainly for fashion and portraits, as well as nature and landscape.  The amount of detail that the 21MP sensor picks up is amazing, and I've gotten prints made as large are 20\"x30\" that are stunning in their detail.  Another advantage of the high megapixal count and the full frame sensor is that you can crop a photo pretty judiciously and still retain a good enough image for a fairly large print.After using the 7D though, I was a little disappointed with the less sophisticated 9 point AF system of the 5D Mark II as well as the slower burst rate.  The 7D definitely makes for a better action or sports camera, and I liked the AF zones it had available.However, for the kind of images I primarly shoot, the Canon 5D Mark II was definitely worth the extra $$ over the 7D.UPDATED 26 MAR 11:  The 9 point AF system continues to irritate the heck out of me, especially since the 9 points are ground very closely in the center leaving much of the outer area uncovered.  Other than that, this camera continues to impress me with its image quality and performance.  My only other nitpick is that you can only bracket a total of 3 exposures (what the camera is set for, and 1 up and 1 down).

I purchased the 5D Mark II to replace my trusty 20D. Waited out the 40D, 50D, and 5D to get just the right camera, and from my time shooting today, it was worth the wait and premium over the crop cameras.  I justified the additional cost this way: Rather than spending another $1,200 on a 16-35 lens that would yield ~26-48mm on the crop camera, I spent it on the 5D, which also gets me video capability. I can now get full use of my 24-105 for wide angle, and that lens really shines on this camera.  My 70-200 is much more useful for closer quarters as well.  I'm thankful that Canon didn't get the 50D right (sorry 50D buyers, but that's my opinion), as it forced my hand on this camera.Pros:* Focus seems faster and more accurate than my 20D, which I'm sure could use some adjusting after 40K images. I've found myself letting the 5D select the focus points more often, which I never did on my 20D (focus center, frame shot, shoot).  I see no reason for any more focus points than it has for the type of shooting I do, but then I've never used a 1 series (Lord help me if I do).* Screen -- simply amazing when moving up from 20D* Viewfinder -- beautiful, bright, almost total coverage vs. looking through a cave in the crop cameras* Image Quality -- Wow. High ISO, low noise. Easily 3 stops better than my 20D. Have only shot a few raw shots (24MB!!!), and will be doing some comparison tonight. JPEG in camera looks amazing, and they aren't displayed with noise reduction in camera.* Build -- very solid, great shutter sound, buttons where they belong* Usability -- highly usable menus, adjustments, modes -- if you've shot Canon before, no surprises here* Fixed small things, like when you accidentally go from Play to shooting, or close the view, it takes you back to the last picture you viewed vs. making you start over (reference 20D -- maybe this is fixed on others since then as well)* Battery -- seems like they beefed it up appropriately for the large screen & live-view needsCons:* Huge file sizes -- Better buy an external disk array for storage. I don't (and most people don't) really need 21 MP -- 15 beautiful MP would be better (imagine the high ISO IQ if they didn't push this to 21MP to stay in the race with Sony & Nikon!).  I'm experimenting using the Medium setting (about 11 MP) to see if IQ is as good proportional to size. That will be much more usable file size for most work.* Nits on custom functions -- settings don't save unless you \"Menu\" back out after selecting them* Current cost of second battery (swear they were $79 a month ago, now $145!!!)I can't comment much on video yet, but have used enough to say that it isn't terribly practical to the average shooter. You shouldn't even consider that this is going to replace a HD camcorder for family shooting (though you may still get away with trying to justify this to your non-photography-buff spouse). I didn't buy it for the video, so I'm not going into detail on that.Bottom line:Amazing camera if you can afford it. Looking forward to putting 100K images through it in its lifetime.

Fine artists take note!  This camera is the best digital alternative to 4x5 film.  When paired with a premium piece of glass, there is little this camera can't do.  The resolution is gorgeous and I have made prints at 40x50\" that are absolutely flawless.Another significant benefit of this camera over comparable models is its performance in low-light conditions.  You can make perfect images at an ISO of 3200 that look just as good as images at an ISO of 2000.  This is great for shooting live music events (what I use it for) in dark clubs or bars.  Noise is not noticeable in properly exposed images until you hit as high as 6400 and even then it is reasonable.The only major flaw of the 5D II is the auto-focus.  Sometimes it works perfectly and sometimes it seems to be possessed by the devil.  I can't make any rhyme or reason out of it, but the beauty of digital is that if you miss one image, you can take another right afterwards and fix your mistakes (the exception is live event or photojournalism, of course).  Some people have had no problems with auto-focus, though, so this flaw might be case-by-case.  It's just something to be aware of, if you purchase, and I recommend testing this feature out shortly after you take the camera out of the box.This camera doesn't have a huge frames-per-second rate, though, at only four.  If you are very much into sports or performance photography, this could be a downfall.  For the average user this won't make a huge difference, but it is something to consider when making the purchase.  If you need a higher frames per second rate, I would suggest taking a look at the Canon 7D (although it is a crop-sensor camera).I use this camera paired with the Canon 24-70 f/2.8 L as a walk around lens and I am consistently able to produce clear, sharp images, even in low light.This, however, is not a beginner's camera.  If you are not familiar with the various camera settings and are not a fan of reading the manual, you'd be better off starting with a consumer-level DSLR before graduating to this body.  I started off with a Canon XTi and then moved on to a Canon 50D before I bought the 5D II.  There is so much you can do with this body in terms of exposure, but its best to learn how all the functions and features work properly otherwise it will be easy to be overwhelmed.All in all I think this camera is truly the best option out there in terms of quality and possibilities.", "Date": "September 26, 2011"}, {"Title": "A Note on Canon's customer Service...

EXCELLENT Camera", "Author": "RJ Bookman \"Rich\"", "ReviewID": "RQY3Z2VZ1S5SC", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I am SOO glad I own this productUpdate Aug 2011... I got an err70 code which required the camera be returned to Canons service center in Irvine CA. I called them up and explained the issue. They gave me free shipping (to print from the printer) for UPS so I packed it up and sent it off to Canon with a letter where I told them how much I loved the camera (I think my compliments and not being pushy made a very big difference). The camera was 2 years old with well over a 100,000 clicks. I receive the news the cost would be about 200 for the repair. When I went to pick it up Canon replaced the shutter and board restoring the camera to like new condition. It would have been fair to bill me more than 1000 for these repairs since the camera was well used and 1 year past the warranty but they didn't. The gentleman explained that by looking at the camera it was obvious it was not dropped or exposed to abuse and because it was a computer issue they would extend this courtesy. THANKS Canon,  I am a LOYAL customer for life.  Makes me feel great about the over 10k investment in your product!  Nice to see a big corporate company look out for their customers.Since the original purchase 2 years ago I have purchased a 2nd 5D, and 6 prime lenses. I was curious if this would be a passing phase but it was not.  I have gotten a lot of pleasure from this camera and continue to do so.The Canon Mark ll 5D is EXCEPTIONAL, anyone who says the 21.1 MP is overkill is underestimating the ability of cropping wildlife photos to the smallest part taken at a far distance.  I can still find sharpness in the smallest possible section of the focused part of a photo. It really is incredible; the vivid monitor's sharpness tells the whole story without dumping the large files onto a laptop. The edge of a ruffled bird's feather, the sunlight on the corner of a leave is still noticeable and sharp with 21.1 MP. Because you can \"double check\" the sharpness prior to snapping the photo using the LCD, you are saving yourself lots of editing (and space, the files are huge) on the computer. This instantly makes you a better photographer and frees up more time taking pictures instead of editing them. Also, if you manage to take fewer photos but better ones, this can make the extra space for these larger 21.1 MP pics (about 28mb)  on your computer's hard drive about a draw.I used for the first time a 100-400 IS lens and after 10 minutes of practice have taken better photos than ever before. The 180 Macro lens takes pictures like a microscope capturing the infinite details of nature hidden from the human eye. Adding the 21.1 MP factor makes your possibilities practically unlimited. If you do not use L series lenses or better, and do not have the budget for these lenses, wait and do not buy this... you will only be torturing yourself by not having them, they are a must have. It would be like driving a Ferrari on rims.Because the AF (auto focus) mode adjusts so many functions including the ISO, an amateur like me can enjoy taking photos while not being concerned about the settings I promised myself I would learn. I just can't put the camera down long enough to read up on it! As promised this camera is excellent in very low light with the noise factor eliminated or greatly reduced. Amazing the way the 5D picks up light at night, just amazing. Once you take pictures at night with this camera, no other camera will do.Also, for anyone wanting to learn more about this camera, (and really any other camera like it) Youtube \"Canon Mark ll 5D\" and you will find about 20 knowledgeable videos of pros doing hands on demonstrations, comparing similar models, and offering priceless tips about functions you never knew the camera had. This, along with Amazon's testimonials proved invaluable in my decision to buy. If you would like to see the manual ahead of time visit Canons website [...]I was initially concerned that the camera may be a little complicated since I moved directly to this higher end camera after using the smaller Canon SD cameras and snapping pics with my friends Rebel 300d. The 5D is quite simple and once you use it, you will be hooked.I also recommend a Hyperdrive, a hand held device up to 160 GIG (about twice as heavy as an iphone and a little thicker) that you can quickly dump the photos from a memory card onto. This will save you money on buying multiple memory cards and lugging around a heavy laptop on weekend trips, after all you can use the freed up space and less weight in your backpack for more lenses.Battery life is impressive and it seems you can do over 900 pics on one charge with LCD and probably 2 or 3 times as much without it.I tried to talk myself into a lower cost camera with less mega pixels. I wanted to say I would get a regular HD video camera that had more performance features later. I relented and ponied up for the 5D and realized that for me personally it was worth the extra bucks. Very nice LCD screen and HD video in one unit. Hopefully this will delay my desire for a better camera and after seeing the impressive resale value of used L series lenses, surprisingly close to cost of new (I bought all used Lenses on Craigslist that look new) and the cameras, I felt the investment would offer future returns I could not pass up.

The 40d is a great camera and quite usable for the kind of photography I enjoy which is mostly landscape.  I decided to take the plunge and go for a full frame camera despite the price.  I have only used the 5d II about 4 times so far and only twice with the 40d for comparison, but feel pretty confident I can report on the differences.  The 2 cameras are nearly identical in color space and dynamic range not to mention resolution per pixel.  In other words if the image pixel count is the same on both cameras, you would be hard pressed to tell which camera took the picture.  The 5d II just has more pixels.  The 5d II trumps the 40d in several other areas too.* First is the high ISO range; I am very happy with 800-1600 ISO images and I use to only like to settle for ISO 100.* The 24-105L lens becomes a fantastic walk around lens because of the 21mp sensor, images can easily be cropped tight to a distant subject.* My 17-40L is now a true wide angle lens!* Shadows at low ISOs have more depth than the 40d.* Lens micro adjustments can make autofocus nearly perfect.  My 70-300 f5.6 back focuses on both bodies, but I was able to easily correct the issue on the 5d II.  I still have to manually adjust on the 40d.* The back screen is much more usable; I even started using live view mode for some shots.* Because of the resolution and dynamic range RAW images are quite flexible so I don't have to take as many variations.* Multiple resolutions to choose from even in RAW.* Better weather sealing is comforting as I do take the camera to places where it is misty and damp.* I've taken a couple of test movies which look lovely.  I just don't see myself using this feature too often.There is always room for improvement so here is my wish list for the mark III.* An internal flash for filling in shadows.* Frame rate of 5/sec would be nice even though I rarely need it.* The ability to select the range for the auto ISO feature; I'd love to be able to limit the range to 200-800 for certain situations.* A pivoting back display is something that I miss from my old Nikon point and shoot cameras.

For the price, the quality is unbeatable. Since I got the 5D Mark ii though, I have now  found myself actually using the machine for what it was meant for, photography! It is very fun to have come from a crop sensor T2i for the past year and a half, and step up to a camera of this quality. It truly is better in every way. I just got it recently, and after getting used to the new control setup and features, I finally getting pictures that I have little to complain about. The biggest thing for me is how it handles hight ISO settings in both camera and video modes. The amount of noise is so minuscule compared to my old T2i, I can shoot over double the ISO with the 5D and still get better image quality. Also the full frame is a treat. I did not realize how much image I was actually missing until I switched. My favorite transition was my 16-35mm 2.8 lens. At 16mm, it seems like I can see twice as much with the full frame! I finally have a REAL wide-angle lens and the edge to edge quality is not fair. It has the warped effect of the wide-angle without the uneven quality throughout the whole picture.

I purchased the Canon 5D Mark II with lens kit 24-105mm. For a while I've been debating whether to buy the body ($2500) along with the 24-70L ($1400) for a total of $3900 or buy this bundled kit for $3300. Prior to my purchase, I rented a 5D Mark II with both lens and realized that IQ (image quality) via raw was absolutely the SAME when blown up. Of course, you'll have better advantages in low light settings with the 24-70, but with the amazingly high ISO handling of the 5D, it didn't make a drastic difference to be worth $600 for that matter whereas I could have invested it towards my next purchase 70-200mm F/2.8. Also, another BIG issue I had with the 24-70 was the WEIGHT. Having transitioned from the T2i, the 5D seemed like a big heavy rock especially after adding on the 24-105 lens. With the 24-70 being ~ 1 lb heavier, I felt the extra weight was really going to drag my satisfaction of this product away. Thus, with the extra 105mm reach, light weight (compared to 24-70) and IS, this an excellent deal.Like I said, having transitioned from the T2i, this camera produces absolutely stunning images. The full frame sensor is definitely a must have for anyone into landscape portraits or anyone who appreciates a wider angle view. I was contemplating whether to wait for the rumored 5D Mark III which is expected to debut in the first quarter of 2012 with the most probable changes being better AF capabilities like the 7D, AF in movie mode and possibly more MP? (ha!). Taking into account the time I'll have to wait along with a potential jack up in price, I felt the 5D Mark II is suffice for any photography enthusiasts.

I came to the 5D Mark II from a 40D.  Being familiar with the 40D, I didn't even need to get the manual out to get going.  Image quality is fantastic.  I have no fear shooting up to ISO 6400 with this thing whereas on the 40D I would only go up to ISO 1600.  So add a fast prime lens and the high ISO abilities of the 5D Mark II and you won't worry about not having a built in flash.A common area of complaint in reviews and internet forums is the \"outdated\" autofocus system.  However, I've never had issues with it. The only time I've had any issues with autofocus is in extremely low light that would challenge any camera.Here's my pros and cons:Pros:Incredible image qualityHigh ISO with low noise21 megapixels of detailno 1.6 conversion factor on the lensesCons:Cost (but you get what you pay for)3.9 frames per second (99% of the time it's not an issue)Huge RAW file size (but that's the price you pay for that much detail)Overall, this camera is the king of image quality.  Yes, there are other cameras with more bells and whistles but they can't match the image quality.  I think for most people these days, the 60D or 7D would be more than adequate.

Kim", "ReviewID": "R11ZFPAWR60K64", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I purchased this camera to use whenever I didn't need my 1D (too heavy to carry around Disneyland).  It's been just about a year and so far, I absolutely love it and gave it a 5 star rating and here are the reason why:Ease of use: coming from other Canon bodies, the controls and function of the camera was a breeze. Infact, some new items in the menu, such as My Menu, allows you to add your most used functions and is very easily accessed.  I've heard Nikon users complaining that Canon controls are difficult and not layout well.  Newsflash: Canon is a completely different system and therefore, is going to be different.  I can control my Canon by touch in total darkness, but put a Nikon in my hands, I'm lost.Image/Picture Quality: it's a Canon with a full size sensor.  They are the pioneers and leaders in CMOS sensors for DSLRs and their dedication shows.  I have no probem shooting ISO1600 and often shoot ISO6400 without much thought. I shoot mostly L series lens and the colors recorded is simply amazing.  Not over saturated like the other brand cameras, just really natural colors. Beautiful for shooting people, as well as nature.Video Quality: at first I was very hesitant to accept the fact that my DSLR has a built-in video camera.  Once I got used to the idea of having a video camera and once I started tinkering with it, I was amazed.  Full HD video shot between stills, then all combined into a slideshow is just awesome!  The actual video quality is breathtaking.  Just like anything else full HD, the clarity seems too good to be true.  Sound is OK, but if I were to do more video capture with my camera, I would definitely purchase an external mic.  If shooting video is your thing, there is NO better video camera out there.  You can spend $10K on a video camera, but bottom line is, the quality isn't going to be as good as the Canon 5DMKII due to the size of the image sensor.  As far as I know, there are no video cameras with an image sensor that's comparable to the Canon 5DMKII. What's more, you can use any of the Canon lens to shoot video with.Weather Sealing:  there seem to be a lot of people out there concerned about the quality of Canon's weather sealing. My experience with the weather seals have all been positive.  I've been in sand storms (desert), full down pour raining (Alaska, Hawaii, etc), and even extreme dust (popcorn ceiling scraped, walls torn down, drywall dust everywhere) and so far, NOTHING, NO DUST inside the camera!  That's amazing! I'd say the camera is pretty well sealed against the environment.Durability:  Don't let the lightweight magnesium alloy body fool you.  Just because it's light doesn't mean it's weak.  It just means it's easier to carry and handle all day long.  I was walking and shooting a subject one day and tripped on a curb.  I fell over and managed to not land on the camera, but the camera's body did strike the side of the curb.  Yes, it left a gash mark down to bare metal, but the camera is still totally fine.BOTTOM LINE:  great tool.  Best camera I've ever used.", "Date": "January 22, 2010"}, {"Title": "A very good camera from Canon", "Author": "M. Dillon", "ReviewID": "R2DF6X87SBSB61", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I went from a film SLR to a few of the early point-and-shoot digitals to a 10D and now a 5D Mark II.  In the early days I wasn't willing to buy high-end digitals due to the ridiculously fast pace of the technology progression.  The 5D II finally sold me.Generally speaking I am quite happy with the camera.  It took some fiddling to get the picture quality I wanted.  My 100-400mm F4 L works incredibly well and has no AF issues.  My 28-105 (stock) F4 L was consistently soft on the AF but the fine focus adjustment CF fixed the issue.  It was surprisingly easy to calibrate, just switch between live-mode focusing (which is very slow but perfect) and standard AF and adjust the fine focus until they match.  I had go all the way to +12 on my 28-105.  On a pixel-by-pixel basis there is still some slight softness looking at the raws, but it looks unavoidable considering how the RGB matrix works on a sensor, plus noise reduction (depending on the ISO one is shooting at), and it is unnoticeable on prints or reductions.  Still, I can only give Canon 3 stars on the AF because while it is always perfect on zooms sometimes it is just too wonky at wider angles, and the camera's automatic AF point selection is a roll of the dice.  Fortunately the AF point can be easily selected.  Finally, I also noticed that the AF sometimes got in the way of shooting with the zoom or tele, where I would hit the shutter button on a fast-moving subject that was never-the-less still in focus, and the camera would decide not to take the picture.  Possibly it was just the AF mode I was in, but it seemed a bit inconsistent.The only way to go is to take full RAW photos and clean them up in post-production.  Canon isn't known for good auto-white-balance but it's a minor inconvenience in post. The 14-bit ADC has wonderful dynamic range.  I had no problem cleaning up wedding photos taken in horrid lighting conditions (beige walls, mix of fluorescents, flash).I also purchased the wireless file transmitter (WFT-E4A).  The WFT is incredibly convenient.  No cables, no fuss... even if I'm not shooting in an area with internet access it's amazing how convenient it is to get it into the computer back home when I do get into range of a base station, or even once I get home.Battery life is excellent compared to earlier models.  I have no complaints on that front.  Both lens are excellent. I upgraded my flash as well.  The 580ExII flash is excellent, far better then the 4xx series I had on my 10D.  Big CF cards with UDMA are expensive but mandatory.  This is not a cheap camera even if you don't count the lens.  The RAWs hit 30MB and you will be unhappy if you aren't using 16G UDMA CF cards.  The camera has no problem taking 500+ full blown shots on one set.Finally I am very impressed with the video capabilities.  It took some messing around to get it figured out but I finally hit upon the '+' button to zoom the live-view, making manual focusing while shooting possible.  Being able to adjust the exposure w/ the new camera firmware is wonderful, too!  The quality is insane, I'll have to buy a faster computer to process it.  It is not a camcorder so don't expect it to behave like one.  It definitely works best when the subject is at a fixed focal point.  Taking video with 100-400mm in stabilization mode 2 just blew me away.One thing I would love to have on this camera is the ability to set a specific auto-ISO range (e.g. 100-800, 400-1200, 800-3200, etc) and then be able to fix both Av and Tv and have the camera only adjust the ISO and flash exposure.  I'm a bit miffed that Canon hasn't done something like that yet. The current auto-ISO does not work very well in any mode other then Av.  So that lack plus the AF issues cause me to drop the review to 4 stars even though I think the camera's only competition is the high-end Nikon (and Nikon has its own issues).-Matt", "Date": "October 20, 2009"}, {"Title": "Not really a video camera", "Author": "Thomas L. Clark", "ReviewID": "R1XA6Q1PA3ATQ1", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I bought this camera a couple of weeks ago. I already owned the first version of the EOS 5D, but I thought it would be handy to have High Def video in the same unit. Many consumer grade handy cams have the ability to shoot stills, but their still photo resolution leaves much to be desired. I would have to carry both a high quality SLR and a handy cam to be ready for both situations. When the 5D Mark II came out I saw the opportunity to get high def both ways in a single camera.Indeed it does that, but the video capabilities of the 5D Mark II are not nearly as convenient to use as almost any consumer grade camcorder at 1/3 the price. Let me be clear about what I am saying. The quality of the high def video that the 5D Mark II shoots exceeds any consumer grade camcorder I have ever seen. Capturing that video however requires both hands whereas almost any handycam is a one handed breeze due to the ergonomic placement of the controls. Not so with the 5D Mark II.You would think that to start shooting video you simply select \"movies\" on the mode dial and click the shutter with your right index finger and everything happens automatically from that point. Not so. Not even close. With the 5D Mark II, first you press the \"live view\" button. The mirror flips up and the image appears on the LCD screen. Then you find the part of the image you want to be in focus and press the AF-ON button (assuming you are using auto focus). Step 3, you press the \"set\" button to start recording video.In the high def mode, the camera will record up to 12 minutes in a single run while making a digital file on the memory card of about 4GB. Think about that. 4 GB for 12 minutes! One 12 minute clip would completely fill a standard single layer DVD. That's a whole lot of data! In fact neither of my Windows based computers can play it back smoothly. Even the built-in playback within the camera itself is jerky. The more motion there is in the scene, the more frames that are dropped. Even the Canon web site acknowledges that the playback \"MAY\" be jerky unless your computer has a certain minimum configuration. To be fair, I will say that Apple computers seem to be much better playing back these huge movie files smoothly. This camera records movies in .MOV file format. That is Apple's Quicktime software. Even though Quicktime does run in a Windows environment, it seems to work much better on a Mac. A recent test I conducted showed that a current model Macbook Pro with a 2.53 GHz Intel CPU did a very smooth playback job using Quicktime.Speaking of focus, you would hope that you simply set the camera to the full automatic mode and your auto focus lens takes care of the rest for the duration of the clip. Once again no. It doesn't work that way. The only way I found to make this camera track the focus in movie mode is to set the mode dial to one of the non automatic positions, and set the focus to the \"servo\" position as though you were trying to capture still images of a moving subject.Zooming? Ah yes, that is another capability that is far less convenient. Most handy cams have a built-in powered zoom that is easily operated with one finger on the same hand that is holding the camera. With the 5D Mark II, as with any quality SLR, zooming is done by reaching around to the front of the camera and rotating a lens ring. Needless to say, that can't be done smoothly if you are hand holding the camera with your other hand.With all the buttons to push and settings to remember, this is not the camera you want for shooting candid spontaneous footage in a hand held situation. To be sure it does a great job shooting video in a controlled environment mounted on a tripod with a fluid head. Without a steady mount however, this camera is best for stills if hand held.", "Date": "March 13, 2010"}, {"Title": "A very nice upgrade and I am not going back", "Author": "AOV \"Always On Vacation\"", "ReviewID": "R11CF4SLJ69H11", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "For the record, some of the reviews posted on Amazon are not associated with the camera Canon 5D Mark II at all.  The majority of them were about price gouging from third parties that are selling through Amazon.  On the other hand, I did purchase the camera along with the 24-105mm lens through Amazon at the price of MSRP and the purchase was delivered on time.  So, I believe people should step back and look at the whole picture first before posting reviews that are NOT associated with the products at all.  Such action does not do justice to the product and waste lots of readers' time.Now, let's get down to the main issue.  I have been using the digital rebel for a few years and I was looking for all sorts of reasons to upgrade to a full frame body.  The Canon 5D Mark II arrived at just the right time.  I placed the order along with the battery grip and I can honestly tell you that I am both happy and also disappointed at the same time.  Since I am only an amateur weekend photographer, my review is only from the novice user's perspective.  If you are looking for a detail feedback specs and comparisons, I believe you will be better off if you read the feedbacks from the pros.Starting with what I like first.  The resolution of 21.1 MP is a huge leap from what I had before.  The first thing to notice is that the raw image files are much larger.  Along with it is the conversion time (from RAW to JPEG) needed is also much longer.  This is just a one time thing during upgrade and I am sure most users will get used to it.  The camera body is solidly made and the size is just right.  Since I go hiking a lot, I don't consider the size (with battery grip) is much to carry.  The majority of my shots are landscape done in Aperture priority.  The burst rate of 3.9 FPS is plenty for me and it is not likely that I will need the feature at all.  What I notice the new camera helped me the most is that during the low light condition, I can switch to the auto IOS option and I have been happy with the results that I have been getting.  In addition to the still photography, I do consider the HD video as an added bonus.  I do take short clips of film from time to time just to make my hiking trips more enjoyable.Now, let's talk about my disappointments.  The 5D Mark II that was delivered to me had a HOT SPOT on the sensor.  First, I did not notice this issue at all as I was too excited to have this new toy with me.  But after a couple nights of testing, I noticed that there is one spot which is always shown as bright Orange Red on my still images.  This HOT SPOT is hard to be seen unless one is to view the picture in 100% mode and pan through all corners.  One can easily ignore this issue if one is to have just one HOT SPOT and one only takes still images.  However, the newly added feature of HD Video changed that completely.  The same HOT SPOT is also shown on all the films that I took.  It stayed at the same coordinate and it is there on every single frame of the film.  That alone did not sit too well with me.  So, I made a point and brought the Canon 5D Mark II body to the service center in person to have it fix.  When I talked to the service rep, I was told it would take 7-10 business days. However, the entire service transaction took more than two weeks to complete.  When I called for status of my unit, I was told the sensor had to be replaced and it has been on back order.  So, it appears that this HOT SPOT issue is more common than usual.  In any case, I finally got the unit back and did more testing.  I am happy to report that I don't have the HOP SPOT issue anymore.  So, as an advice, if one is to buy the camera, I think it would be wiser to buy it in the store and have a test run at first.  Perhaps take a short film clip of a dark room and see if there are any static HOT SPOT(s) on all frames of the film.  This would be a good way to filter the bad from the good.  Also, I have been trying to play the HD movies on my PC and I must admit, the playback is rather jerky.  I was told that it is the PC QuickTime player's doing.  I did not see any issue from the playback through the camera at all.  In addition, I've asked a friend to play the same movie file on a MAC and it was just fine as well.  In this case, I think I can only blame the Apple QuickTime software.In conclusion, I do like this camera and the features that it offers.  However, I can't really give a five star on this review as I believe Canon may have a quality issue that they need to address first.  Before you buy, do some tests in the store and pick the right one to take home with.

Yes, the focus system is not as sophisticated.  This camera came out earlier, and thus its video controls aren't dedicated.  Beyond those 2 things, this camera is my favorite in every other way.  If I'm going somewhere and I'm taking 1 camera, this is the 1.  It does make you want better glass, as it's using the corners more and the higher resolution benefits more from sharper glass.  The video from it is fantastic, though focus is hard to attain at larger apertures.  I have just ordered a Z-Finder in hopes it will make focusing easier.  I love prime lenses and shallow depth of field and for those purposes, this camera is the clear choice over the 7D.  If you are looking for sports and wildlife (particularly birding) the 7D may be the better choice.  This camera can still provide great results in those conditions, but I don't think those things were a focus when they were designing this camera.

If you want the best results for portraits, candids and landscapes that you can get for a reasonable hobby-ist price, this thing is the way to go.A few reasons I pick this up over the 7D are:- slightly better overall image quality.- slightly better depth of field control.- about 1 stop better (lower) noise at high ISO's.If these things are a consideration for you, I don't think you'll be disappointed picking this over the 7D.

I like shooting sports and wildlife but I don't really miss 7 frames-per-second or the AF from the 7D.  I just use the center focus point and it works great!Full frame lets me use my lenses in the way that they were designed to be used.  Effective DOF is shallower so I'm using my lenses at F/7-9 where I used to use f/4-6.  That get's me more into the sweet spot of sharpness, gives me more flexibility to \"open up\" the lens, and really makes a big difference in picture quality, esp. with tele and macro lenses.The metering system is better on the 5D than the 7D.  It exposes perfectly 99% of the time.  And it is very consistent between shots.The combination of great metering, great noise performance, and firmware that recognizes lenses/focal lengths/IS allows me to set the camera to auto ISO in changing light and feel confident of getting usable photos.  I just use Av/Auto ISO and the camera very intelligently sets the shutter speed based on focal length and IS.

The colors in these photos just make you go... wow, what beautiful lighting!The only problem I've noticed is that its auto-focus fails sometimes in low light if the thing it's focusing on is a solid color.

Symonds", "ReviewID": "RGGPTBGYCHT57", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I'll leave the number crunching to the pocket-protector folks who do their thing much better than I could (or would care to). I just want to pass on my experience so far with this camera after about a year of owning it.The good: love the ergonomics of this camera, the solid feel and the overall handling. The build quality is high. The RAW files that come out of it have a hard to define quality to them that I find pleasing. Not to mention the files are very flexible for post-production.However, this camera has a few problems that result in 4 stars.First up, the evaluative metering almost always overexposes outside during the day. Sunny, cloudy or anything in between. Not a huge deal but it's annoying. And it does it so consistently you'd think it would be easy enough for Canon engineers to fix it. I never seem to have this problem inside shooting with available light. And the exposure is always spot on using ETTL flash. No matter, exposure compensation to the rescue. Still, just seems quirky for a $2k body for it to be off so consistently in the same situations.Next up, the notorious focus issue that has polarized so many online. Not sure if it is a QC issue or what but right out of the gate I noticed that the camera wasn't focusing correctly. I would focus on somebody's eyeball, either in autofocus or manual focus, then make my exposure. The resulting image would show the tip of the subject's nose in focus but their eyeball soft. Again and again. Using a lens target and a tripod to create a controlled environment, I concluded that the alignment between the lens, mirror and pentaprism must not be right. A simple way to prove that it has something to do with the relationship between the lens, mirror and pentaprism is to take them out of the equation. Focus in liveview works perfectly. That's because you're focusing directly on the sensor in liveview, bypassing the other components.So if you have this problem, no you are probably not the slack-jawed troglodyte that Joe Pro on the camera forum made you out to be.Although Canon has never formally admitted it, I'm pretty sure this is a common known issue. I told Canon support what I thought was wrong, sent the camera back and they repaired it under warranty. It's fine now.(BTW, you can calibrate your body to different lenses but in this case the camera was way off. Not only that, it seemed to be off by different amounts depending on if I was focusing in the left or right side of the frame. Also off by different amounts at different focal lengths along a zoom len's range.)With the focus issue now out of the way and enough experience to know I have to compensate for the goofy outdoor metering, I find little to complain about. I've run into a few little things here and most of them were simply the result of having not read the manual thoroughly enough. Also, I know some people find low-light autofocus to be either poor or not possible. I can't say I've experienced that.I can't speak highly enough of the image quality, especially how well the files hold up under low light. Overall I'm really happy with this camera.~The 24-105mm f4 lens is a nice walk-around lens. I'm not really a fan of zooms in general but they are handy and this one covers a really useful range. It may not seem like a big deal but the constant aperture is really helpful when you shoot manual, especially shooting available light in low-light situations. I'd say the image quality is a little better than middle of the road (again I'm not a numbers guy). Lightroom helps to smooth out some of the problems. It's a solid lens but nothing special. If I was to redo the purchase, I would probably get the body and a used 24-70 or just get the 35mm and 85mm primes instead.", "Date": "October 7, 2012"}, {"Title": "If you are boarder line deciding on this vs a lesser body, AND have been drooling over it. GET IT.", "Author": "Justin Lee", "ReviewID": "R2WCU0JYGIO2HO", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I have had the 5d mark ii for just about two months now. And my goodness what a difference in having this body compares. I came off of using a Canon Rebel XTI since 2006. I heavily used the XTI for travel photos landscapes, indoors, museums, family functions and personal wedding photos; along with a 28-135mm IS lens.I'll compare what upgrading from the \"beginner's DLSR\" to this semipro/pro body, using casual language since I'm nowhere near being a pro, but take my photography seriously as a hobby.Size & Weight- The 5d markii is significantly bigger all around. The weight is more substantial and the materials used seem more sturdy and solid. The xti looks almost like a toy compared to the 5dmarkii. Don't let this size scare you away, I see many of people traveling with the 5d body or 7d/60d which are about the same size, and the feeling of the camera is just very nice to hold.Crop vs. zoom- It has taken me quite some time to learn how the crop factor on the XTI affects the image vs. the full frame. I'm currently shooting with the same 28-135mm lens, and the same lens on the 5d body is significantly wider. What I mean by this is you get much more of what you are looking at on the view finder without having to step backwards to fit more into the frame. (After using the xti for so long, I hate to think of how much I have missed out on my images without the full frame.Speed- The sound and speed of the shutter are different on this camera. The shutter sounds a bit more violent, but the speed in between exposures is quite noticeable. I recently took some outside photos of my 3 year old niece and I was able to get much more of her facial expressions just using the single shot mode and still got more shots in than before.Camera bag- if you have a small camera bag (single dslr) for an xti sized body, you will likely need to upgrade your bag since the body and eventually, the lens you attach will no longer fit.Image quality and sizeThe full frame camera and bump of 20 mb per image are huge when you want to crop and zoom and still be able to print out a clear image. Graininess is less when you look closer at the image, but I'm sure that will improve even more after I purchase a 28-70mm f2.8 L lens.Menus & wheelIf you are a pretty seasoned user of the XTI style menus, the 5D MKII menus did not take very long to figure out. The wheel does make scrolling through menus and thumbnails easier. The exposure and focus point buttons are still taking some time to get used to (position on the body wise)LCD screenThis has a beautiful screen attached and you can truly see what the image will look like when you get home and on your actual computer monitor. The colors are more rich and deep in color. The screen is bright and very clear.VideoHave not taken a lot of video on this body yet, but I did notice you can't have IS switched on while filming, otherwise, you hear the motor running in the video.SummaryIf you can afford a body of this caliber, take your photography seriously, and value the people or things you are taking pictures of, I think that alone is worth the $. Time and again, I wish I had a better camera body to capture those moments like birthdays and be able to print or send large images of the moments.

I upgraded from a T1i to this camera. The 5DMKII is significantly heavier than the T1i, especially gripped. The controls are slightly different but intuitive for a previous Canon user. But that's just the small stuff...Most importantly, the low light capability ROCKS! With my T1i, I could go up to ISO800 and maybe ISO1600 with post processing before the photo became unusable. With this camera, I was shooting away at ISO3200 and while there was some noise, it easily went away with a little PP. It takes beautiful photos, even with the 50mm 1.8! I do love the 24-105mm f/4 which I think is a great range to function as a walk about lens. Really, I now feel limited by only my skill. (I'm still an amateur when it comes to dSLRs-I've upgraded quickly!). I'm so happy I upgraded. I have only one complaint and that is with the autofocusing system. I'm not sure if it's just because I'm still learning but I do think it's a little slow and outdated. I wish it had more focus points. Also, I miss having a flash on the camera. I try not to use the on camera flash- I hate flash photography- but sometimes it's needed...I do have a Speedlite but I don't want to have to carry it everywhere!Overall, I LOVE this camera and I'm so glad I upgraded.

I still use that camera for sports and outdoor photography.  Then I decided to get a portrait camera and although I was tempted to spend the big bucks and get a 1DS III, this camera came out with that same big sensor AND video, which the 1DSIII doesn't even have.  Well, the story gets better and better the more I shoot with this camera.  The resolution is incredible, the exposure and saturation are consistently excellent and the lack of noise at high ISO is amazing.  I have a large format 13x19\" printer that I print shots taken from this camera with and all I can say is WOW.  When I can print these shots that big and still be amazed at the quality of the picture, that's when I really get excited about this camera.  I can shoot at ISO800 and still consider the pictures excellent.  I was reminded of how special that is the other day when I had my 1D Mark III and took it indoors at an event, and ran it at ISO800.  The noise was so noticeable and I had to really bump up the noise filters during post-processing, but not with the 5D Mark II.  I also love the ability to crop down on images much farther than any other camera I have and still have a tack-sharp image that can be printed large format.  This is easily my favorite camera.

The construction is really sturdy, made from magnesium alloy.  It has nice nice dust and weather resistance throughout - right down to the memory card slot, battery door, LCD and buttons.  The accessory shoe is well-built and I have never had any problems with connectivity with my external flash or wireless triggers.  The EF lens mount (the 5D Mark ii will not mount any EF-S lenses) is firm and gives no discernible travel - even when I have my Canon 70-200 f/2.8L IS ii attached.Controls, Menus and Display:The controls and menus are intuitive.  Placements of main dial, quick control dial, ISO, AF, and enlarge/reduce buttons are all fine .  Canon allows for a \"my menu\" feature that allows you to make your own custom functions  - I haven't personally used this but it looks pretty useful.The display is bright and sharp.  I can view it well even outdoors in bright sunlight.  The various display modes are helpful (4 in all - Large image and status line; Large image status line and image #; Small image, status line, lum histogram; Small image, status line, lum+RGB histograms).Live view works well, one can also zoom and preview depth of field in live view.  Live view is also functional in movie mode.Picture quality:The camera is really nice for portraiture, giving a very even and true-to-life skin colors and tones.  With respect to landscape and architectural photography the body is sharp, with good saturation producing really nice blues, greens and reds.Positives:-Excellent low light performance - this body is quite frankly the difference between a usable image and an unusable image in low-light situations.  This is mission critical for the dimly lit churches and reception halls for wedding photographers or in other indoor candid situations.-Photos from ISO 50-3200 are usable and have acceptably low noise.  The occasional photo above ISO 3200 can be salvaged by going black & white.-Battery life - the LP-E6 battery is a workhorse.  I shoot 4,000-8,000 shots at a wedding and I have never ran out of battery using my BG-E6 grip with two LP-E6's.-No on-camera flash - I loathe on-camera flashes.  They don't work, they ruin pictures and they are flat out annoying.  This is a professional quality body.  On-camera flashes are for soccer moms and the annoying people who get in your way at weddings.-Very well built, designed and organized.Negatives:-Microphone sound quality is not great.  This is not a huge deal for me as I don't use the Mark ii for video.-Would have liked more frames per second.-The shutter has a very distinct sound - almost like a rubber band slapping a piece of aluminum foil.  I don't care for the sound very much.-AF points are all in relative center of frame, making it difficult to AF on elements outside of that spread.Bottom line:I am extremely happy with my two 5D Mark ii's.

With the 60D I found I could only use 50% crops for critical work.  With the 5D Mark II, I found 100% crops were so detailed I could use them no problem.  Additionally the low light capability wipes the floor with the 60D.  The differences are night and day.  With the 60D I would see noise creeping in at around 800 or so ISO.  1600 was the max I felt comfortable shooting in, with 3200 requiring heavy use of noise reduction software resulting in much less detail.  With the 5D Mark 2 ISO 3200 is much better than the 60D's 1600 ISO.  I can actually shoot at 6400 for less critical work and it looks much better than the 60D at 3200.  The retention of detail and the way the camera squashes noise is very impressive. If you have the coin this camera is a rock star.  However! The 5D Mark III is set to be announced on Feb 28th 2012 or within the week of Feb 28th 2012, so you may want to hold off and grab this sucker at a steal of a price.  If you need the camera now, you wont be disappointed.  Another thing to note.Auto Focus:I've read a lot of people complaining that this camera only has 1 cross type focus point.  I want to say that most people use the center focus point anyway, so it really is a bit of an overblown issue.Canon vs Nikon:The D700 has better focusing. But unless you're doing sports this is a non issue.  The low light is better than the Canon, but you only have 12.1 megapixels.  It BETTER have better low light capabilities than the 5D Mark II. But honestly, at only 1/3rd of a stop better in low light giving up around 2x the resolution seems a bit silly.  It is argued that the only time you will need the extra resolution is when printing billboard sized images. This does not factor in cropping at all.  If you want to crop your 5d Mark II image to say 100% you can do that while maintaining stellar levels of detail.  With the D700 you're left with a lot left detail.  Another thing any prospective buyer should do is look at the prices and quality of their potential lenses. I would start at the 24-70, then the 70-200 to cover your zoom range.  The canons being cheaper and the 70-200 IS II being MUCH better (probably the best lens on the market)  Then compare primes, the Cannon has the 85 1.2 V2 vs the Nikkor.... 85 1.4?  You can't find a Nikkor 1.2 and the Canon 1.2 is only ~$100 more than the 1.4 Nikkor.  The canon has a 50 1.2 the Nikon has a 50 1.4.  Again Nikkor doesn't even have a 1.2 lens.One last thing about Nikon vs Canon.  Movie mode. I know I know, but if you EVER want to record a movie, EVER, you cannot on a D700 and you get commercial level videos on the 5D Mark II. Not just adequate movies, but box office quality movies.

Just an average guy using everyday words to describe my experience. If you are a professional photographer, then you already know this stuff and this review is not directed at you. I am talking to the amateur/intermediate photographer (those of us out there photographing only for the pure pleasure of it and for the sake of family memories -- and not getting paid for it).I recently purchased this camera (Canon EOS 5D Mark II) as a step-up from my entry level DSLR (Canon EOS Rebel XSi). As an amateur/intermediate hobbyist photographer, I felt I had grown beyond the capabilities of the XSi. I had been drooling (yes, that's the technical term) over the 5D Mark II for several years because of its ability to capture full-frame, full 1080p HD video and outstanding picture quality. As great as those features are, there's more to this camera...When your little ones are running around saying and doing the things that your little ones do, you reach for your camera to capture the moment. However, you may have found the average point-and-shoot camera falls way short of your expectations. After all, the little ones rarely stand still long enough for you to get the camera ready to snap that perfectly composed candid moment to treasure forever. If you've already stepped up to an entry level DSLR then you've found the difference in camera capability and performance are likely very happy with it. However, there comes a point when you may want a little more performance out of your camera.The Canon EOS 5D Mark II will step you up to a world of photographic performance and capabilities you could only dream about with an entry level DSLR camera. The ability to shoot 16 frames continuously without releasing the shutter (depending on your picture quality setting) is truly amazing. Changing the picture style from Landscape to Portrait or any other setting is much easier and can be done with literally only 2 to 3 clicks in the info. menu. The ability to capture hi-res JPG or RAW (or both) pics while SIMULTANEOUSLY shooting HD video is another HUGE plus -- you won't have to switch back and forth between shooting video and stills to capture the moments how you want to capture them.I would also add the build quality on this camera is the best. If you happen to drop the 5D Mark II with its magnesium-alloy body, you will likely break what ever you drop the camera on -- including ceramic tile, instead of breaking the camera (speaking from experience). The 5D Mark II receives the highest marks for build quality and contains virtually no plastic parts compared to an entry level DSLR. Also, it's weather seals really make a big difference in protecting your camera against the elements. Last year I took my Canon Rebel XSi with my family to the beach on vacation. I got some really great shots of the kids and my wife playing in the surf and the sand! However, when I got the camera back home, I was unable to get all the sand out of all the tiny spaces including inside the camera. I ended up having to take the camera to my local camera shop to have it professionally cleaned so it would work properly again. Not cheap and also not an issue with the 5D Mark II.It's really difficult to put everything into words about why you should consider spending the extra money for this camera when the T3i and 60D are also very capable cameras. So before deciding to spend the money on this camera instead of the T3i or the 60D, I compared all three of them both online with professional photographer's technical advise (just google search: \"Canon T3i or Canon 60D vs. Canon 5D Mark II\") and also in person for a practical comparison at my local camera shop. If you have the money and are considering stepping up with your DSLR -- goto your local camera shop and compare the Canon T3i, Canon 60D and the 5D Mark II.

Stepping up from APS-C range of Canons, I photograph portraiture, landscape & fun events. I also film corporate & event promos & do fun shorts with like-minded people.Got this as a refurbished unit to save some $$, unit came with 600 on the shutter & in perfect condition. Everything is intuitive for the seasoned canon user. What stood out for me was that ISO performance is a MAJOR leap ahead. I can push it to 3200 or 4000 & still get clean visuals. Entering the full frame, everything is wider on your lenses, requiring a little adaptation in terms of 'focal length estimation' - you'll have to get used to looking into the viewfinder and going \"gee, that's wider than I expected\". On good glass, this camera is stellar & renders everything cleanly as expected. Cheaper glass like the 50mm F1.8 might feel a little 'maxed out' on this body.Planned shoots bring cash, but it's shooting energetic stuff in the wet & dirty that I prefer, and with proper weather-sealed lenses, this body is a tough one. It has been with me into waterfalls, under heavy tropical rain, mud events & the such. The most moisture that got in so far was a drop of condensation beneath the LCD display protector - which dried up within an hour. While it cannot be submerged underwater, I wouldn't hesitate to wash it down after a muddy run. Love that I can get down and dirty, paying more attention to what i'm shooting without worrying so much about ruining my equipment.For you video people, besides the full frame feel, video quality is comparable with the other cheaper models, ie 7D, 60D after post-production. I rely quite heavily on the MagicLantern firmware hack when shooting video & I find this 2008 model rather stunted without it. FPS overrides, shutter locking, histograms, audio monitoring etc are all crucial to getting good footage, and these are not provided with the original Canon firmware. Oh and did I mention RAW video is such a sexy attribute ;) Anw, did the 5D2 contribute much in improving my video footage? Besides the ability to film in any weather and that sexy 35mm sensor with insane ISO control, not really, no.Battery life whilst shooting photos is decent. I can manage about 6 to 7 hours of continuous shooting before needing to swap batteries. Batteries last much less while filming, about 1 - 2 hours before they die out on the set. With MagicLantern's powersaving hacks I can just about manage 3 hours.As for cons, AF on this system isnt exactly the best, especially when paired with cheaper lenses. I find myself leaving my cheaper glass on MF most of the time when in low light situations to prevent disappointments.Moire & aliasing is quite prominent on this unit, but there's nothing a good eye on the lookout can't fix.Who should get this camera?The photographer or cinematographer who has a well-used entry level DSLR, is shooting stunning photos with one exposure per motive and is looking to venture into higher-end professional/full frame territory & push his glass without bursting the bank (comparatively)Who shouldn't get this camera?The brand new photographer who thinks that gear is his limitation and that getting an expensive pro-DSLR body will instantly make his photos look nicer.It's an amazing body.

There are no \"pre-programmed\" settings but I quickly found they were not missed at all.  I especially like the \"joystick\" control for quick changes to the various camera settings.  I took shots at a wedding reception indoors under existing light without a flash and was impressed by the lack of noise at higher ISO settings.

This is a full frame camera that provides great resolution for awesome cropping or wide angle shots. Although the current AF system is old, it is still very good. You will need to make sure your glass and body are at their optimum calibration as it is possible that even new out of the box to be slightly off. The factory will calibrate any Canon products within the first year for free. I suggest that you take them up on the deal. The only cost is your shipping to them. They are fast and good at what they do. Be aware that every lens can be off in either direction from zero being a front or back focussing issue. The body itself can be off, so do make sure the setup is right before doing any comparisons. All EOS models now offer micro adjustments to limit the need for sending out for calibration if you don't have the ability to part with your equipment for a few days.The 5D Mark II takes stunning crisp photos. I've tested with 24-70 2.8L USM, 70-200 2.8L USM, 50mm 1.4, 85mm 1.8 with very good results. The HD video is a bonus. The lack of autofocus is not the worst trade off. The option to take clips of video when needed is nice though.If you are on the fence about brand to choose and have not invested to much in one brand or another, do look into both Nikon, and Canon for the best options for you. The extra focus points are really nifty on the d700, but the lack of resolution and HD video option on the canon side is a big plus. Those moving up from existing Canon Digitals will appreciate the faster and more accurate focus that comes with all 9 points being in focus with hidden focus point assisting the crisp focus to the corners. I'm very pleased with this model and the options for indoor and outdoor shooting. ISO is so good that 3200 is better than 1600 on my 50D.  The only issues I've had are with the slower continuous shooting FPS, and the flimsy shutter sound that does not inspire confidence in comparison to my 50D's fast and bold thuds. Ironically, the 5D2's capable of locking on to the targets in low light even with a delayed shutter will capture action more reliably than the 50D. I shoot a lot of indoor night shots in poorly lit gyms that the 5D2 outshines the 50D on the keeper rate with the identical lenses. The 50D has become my outdoor maximum reach tool. Even then the crops from the 5D2's are better. Its just the case where I carry the contrasting distance lenses to avoid missing shots altogether.A great camera that is up there with the really high end SLR's with a much lower entry level. Glass is still expensive but you can keep that for ever if you take care of it.Edit:After several years of pure magic from this camera and replacing the 50D with a 7D. The 7D is the next best thing to the 5D2 when the 5D3 is not an economical addition to your gear. The 5D2 has an incredible ISO range with such great image clarity, even with action shots in less than perfect lighting. Shooting side by side with the 7D has me wishing I just had 2 5D2's.

Pictures have been sharp corner to corner, and even looking through the viewfinder is crystal-clear and bright (that could be attributed to the f/2.8 Lens).  Speaking of bright, the LCD is amazing compared to the old 10D.  I do not however use live view, I use the viewfinder, as when shooting moving objects there is quite a bit of lag between live view's image and shutter.I usually take ~100 Pictures each time on my nature shoots, and the battery has held up great. I usually recharge it every few shoots.  I do plan to get a 2nd battery before the wedding I'm shooting next year however.  I've read notes about focusing problems, but I have encountered none.  And I have shot from less than a foot away to infinity focus and everywhere in between, and the only noticeable issues I have had were when my cheap $20 tripod didn't like the shutter shake on 1/3 sec or longer shots.

They did reimburse the extra shipping charge yet didn't provide an explanation as to why the lateness.The 5D mark II is outstanding nevertheless and picked this over both the new 5D3 and 6D as there is not a significant difference in image quality other than the super ISO ability of the newer sensors. I have used all three systems and the 5D2 is quite sufficient for everything I do. The AF is not horrible as many claim, just learn what it can and can't do and work within those constraints if you rely heavily on the AF system. I have no issues in low light if the subject contains detail.Another reason why I went with the 5D2 is that the price can't be beat and the construction is far superior than the 6D, as well as the ergonomics. I shot a little over a few hundred pictures with the 6D and can't get over the small body (same size as the 60D) and the condensed AF points. The 6D may be more sensitive, but when you are working with shallow depth of field, the old \"focus and recompose\" method doesn't work and will throw off your focus... You need AF points that extend to the edges of the frame and the 5D2 provides this better than the 6D. Furthermore, the wifi on the 6D is Canon's method of testing the waters with a lackluster mobile app with limited range and significant lag, it definitely shines as a first generation product or one that struggled to get out of beta. No update as of this writing for the iPhone 5 screen.My upgrade path is to use the 5D2 until the 5D4 is released or if the 5D3 drops to below 2K for body only. I will say that the 5D3 is by far a better camera, but not for its price. The AF, silent shutter, and speed is near perfect, but does not overshadow the 5D2 in image quality or value.If you are moving from a crop sensor, you will notice right off the bat how beefy the shutter is as the mirror mechanism slams pretty vigorously and makes a loud and obnoxious sound with every release of the shutter. Long exposures and even slow shutter speeds less than 1/15 need either a tripod or mirror lockup to avoid camera shake from the mirror slap... It is substantial. The sound may be loud but is not a cheap sound... nothing even remotely like a rebel or crop slap, it sounds professional. If I had to compare with vehicles, I would say any rebel camera sounds like a cheap Honda with a 4\" exhaust, while the 5D2 is more like the sound of a ford raptor.'Nuff said.... If you're having a hard time between the 6D or 5D3, just go ahead and get the 5D2... with all the money your saving, you can afford to put something other than a cheap 50mm 1.8 on the front, like say a second \"L\" like the 70-200 or 16-35.

Moreso than the 7D, which is superior in several respects, but will depreciate like mad.Since buying the camera I have shot several thousand images and lots of movie footage, and I have taken it on holiday, mounted it on my bicycle, and used a wide range of fast and wide and sharp manual focus lenses. I have no regrets. I don't have the time or resources to subject the 5D to a thorough technical evaluation. Plenty of websites already do that, with ISO comparisons and so forth. The reviews were uniformly positive. It doesn't cope too well with highlights. If you want to shoot wide angle you're in a world of pain. Apart from that, you get a huge and malleable file.For a week I had access to both my original 5D and the sequel, and it was interesting to compare the two. Apart from a larger screen, some shifted buttons, and a more angular prism, the MkII's body is hard to quickly tell apart from the MkI. The MkII's shutter makes a clickier sound than the original 5D's hollow clack. The memory card door still feels a bit flimsy. I preferred the original 5D's on/off switch. It took me a short while to get used to the repositioned top panel buttons - they have all shifted one place to the left in order to make way for the backlight button. The screen is of a higher resolution than the original although it was not the revelation I was expecting. It has a clever automatic brightness control that works well. The interface feels a little slower than the original 5D, no doubt because it is shifting much more data. When I zoom right into a RAW file, the camera takes a moment to rez up the preview image. There's a noticeable but slight delay when scrolling through images, and it takes a short while to write a burst to the card. The first 5D felt instant. Canon still has not fixed the oddness whereby the front dial changes the aperture in AV mode but the shutter speed in Manual mode, which is mighty irritating if you do a lot of flash photography and switch between AV and Manual frequently. Nikon's interface is smarter in this respect, albeit that I prefer Canon's rear dial for setting exposure compensation.The autofocus system appears to be the same as before. It has a diamond pattern of autofocus sensors that are clustered around the middle of the viewfinder. The corners are bare. I do a lot of portrait shooting, with the camera on its side, and I would have preferred a simple 3x3 grid of autofocus points, spaced evenly across the frame. The old five-in-a-row system used by the 1n film camera would have suited me. If you use \"rule of thirds\" composition then the 5D's autofocus system isn't much use because there aren't autofocus points in the right place. It has 5x and 10x magnified live view which is extremely useful for manual focus. As before, the stock focus screen isn't ideal; I have installed the EG-S \"super precision\" screen, which is slightly better although don't expect a miracle. In practice I find myself using Live View almost as much as the legacy optical viewfinder.As a stills camera it's essentially a 5D with more pixels and better light sensitivity, no mean feat. When using the original 5D I had no fear of ISO 400 but was wary of ISO 800 and ISO 1600, although I never felt that I was just wasting memory card space when I shot at ISO 1600. With the Mk II I have no fear of ISO 800 and not much fear of ISO 1600, and for that matter I have pushed shots at ISO 3200 with impressive results. When the images are sized down from 21mp for the internet the noise becomes even less apparent. The extra resolution is handy, although it's not going to transform your image-making and it certainly hasn't transformed mine. My instinct is that the 5D MkII's RAW files are softer than the original 5D's at 100% zoom, and I'm not just copying that opinion from Digital Photography Review. When sized down slightly, or sharpened, or sized down and sharpened, they are very crisp. I like to think of it as the crispest 12mp camera ever made.If it was just a stills camera it would be a waste. Unless you make huge prints, or you expect to do a lot of cropping - and if you are, you probably aren't reading this - twenty-one megapixels is absolutely ridiculous. Overkill for most applications and, conversely, underspecified for high-end landscape and architectural and copying work. You'll be disappointed by the relatively sluggish file handling and enormous files that are four times the size of your screen and will take ages to upload to Facebook. BUT it's also a movie camera. Not a camcorder; think of it as a proper motion picture camera that you have to put on a tripod and think about. You have to plan ahead, focus manually, think about the storyboard. Clips are limited to twelve minutes maximum, which is a problem if you expect to leave the camera running and then edit later on. The 1080p high-def files are about 300mb per minute and require a fast computer to play, and some editing software throws a fit unless you have a beefy computer. The camera does not record 720p, which is a lower but still very high resolution and is easier to work with, and it doesn't record at 50fps; the 7D and most other digital SLRs including the 550D do this. The only other video option is a 640x480 VGA mode which is just silly, and I have not used it. For soft subjects the video is superb. For detailed landscapes it suffers badly from moire.The sensor cleaning mode. I just thought I'd mention it. Unlike the original 5D, it actually cleans the sensor. It's a godsend. When the camera was new it was limited to automatic movie shooting at exactly thirty frames a second. Subsequent firmware updates have given the user manual control over aperture and shutter speed, a built-in audio level meter, and the frame rate is now (in the UK) selectable between 23.97 and 25fps. It will be interesting to see if Canon continue to update the camera's firmware to include 720p and 50fps. It's a positive thing that they have kept working on the camera, although it has the side-effect of making the manual obsolete. I have flipped through the manual once or twice. It seems sensible enough. The only thing I needed it for was a problem whereby an old flash unit didn't fire in Live View (you have to turn off the Silent Shooting option), but that's a pretty esoteric thing that almost nobody else will need to know.Still, the 5D has been a hit with indie filmmakers because it can produce a filmic, 70mm look on a much lower budget. If you have to shoot video interviews for the special features on a DVD, or make a short documentary about anything where you can set the camera up on a tripod and you don't have to move it too much, and you don't want to carry around a big professional camera rig, it's your camera, although again a 7D or 550D might be more sensible. A 550D would save you money for lenses. The 5D's video has two major limitations. The first is the \"rolling shutter\" effect, whereby if you pan the camera too quickly the picture seems to undulate. You don't have to pan the camera very fast for this to become apparent. Because of this, if you're shooting an action sequence with a hand-held street chase it's not the best option. The second limitation is that the movies are \"finished\" in the same way that JPEGs are finished, which is to say that there's no movie RAW mode. If the white balance is greatly wrong when you capture it you can't easily correct this after the fact. Video shooting uses the current Picture Style, and if your selected style has heavy sharpening, the video will have heavy sharpening, and you won't be able to get rid of it. And the third thing is the moire, which is distracting and might be a deal-breaker.As for the rest of the camera, it's nice to have the new things that became standard after the original 5D came out. Live View is useful for manual focus; the sensor cleaning mode is a godsend. There are however a lot of things that Canon could have added. There's no electronic spirit level, no built-in remote flash trigger, and no in-camera HDR or panorama stitching. None of these are essential features but I would not have minded them. The 7D has a couple of these already, and the built-in remote flash trigger would have been particularly useful. Nikon's cameras have had this option for some time.Is the 5D MkII worth the best part of two thousand pounds plus fifty pounds for a second battery and another fifty pounds for a couple of big memory cards? I have pondered this long and hard, and on a rational level I believe the answer was yes in 2008, no in 2011. The 5D's technical edge over the 550D is very slight, and for the same money you could buy a 550D and a very nice range of lenses. Furthermore the 5D's full-frame sensor complicates wide angle lens selection immensely; if you want to go wider than 24mm you will not find anything in Canon's inventory that is sharp to the corners. Nikon, Zeiss, and Leica sell some superb ultra wide lenses, some of which you can mount on the 5D, but Canon's forte is medium and long telephoto. The company has always had a blind spot at the wider end of the range. A 550D would give you access to the EF-S range, including the 17-55mm f/2.8 IS, which does not have a direct full-frame equivalent (at least not with image stabilisation). The 5D MkII's full-frame sensor does however make sense if you plan to use fast, wide angle primes such as the 24mm f/1.4 and 35mm f/1.4.And that is that. No, while I'm at it, the batteries. The MkII uses a new type of battery that has a chip in it, which tracks the power level, shot count, and recharge performance of each individual unit. These batteries are physically similar to the older BP-511 models and they last and last. At the time I originally wrote this review the batteries were only available from Canon, and were very expensive. There were some Hong Kong / China eBay clones, but they didn't have the chip and required their own special charger, which made foreign trips a bother, because you had to carry this special charger in addition to the Canon model. However, in the last couple of months fully-compatible chipped batteries have become widely available for about a quarter the price of the official model. Whether they are clones, or simply fourth shift models made for the Far Eastern market, I know not. I have a couple of these - in Canon boxes, almost identical to the battery that came with the camera - and they work fine, they haven't blown up the camera and if they do I will tell you.EDIT: As of May 2011 the camera is still going strong, and for a variety of reasons - VAT rise, economic slowdown, tsunami - it now costs more new than it did when I bought it a year ago, which is impressive. Despite the price, the MkII was a big hit at the time and is still selling strongly for a heavy, semi-pro camera, despite rumours of a MkIII that seems to have been pushed back and back.", "Date": "August 14, 2011"}, {"Title": "rating the camera, not the price", "Author": "B-House \"Married with five kids.

I \"upgraded\" to this camera from the original 5D & at first was in love, but that quickly faded and over the past year has grown into a frustrating experience.Pros:-Video. The video is STUNNING and one of the only reasons why I'm not selling this immediately. It's gorgeous when coupled with a \"L\" lens & produces professional videos with the right video equipment.-LCD screen is fabulous & a huge step-up from the 5D.-ISO. High ISO capabilities with little to no noise. A HUGE improvement from the 5D. Reason #2 for me keeping this camera.Con:-Focusing system. Seriously, one of the WORST I've ever seen. Images are constantly out of focus, and even images that are \"in\" focus are lacking a little bit of \"uumph\" that I get with my 5D (see below). Nothing is ever tack sharp or creamy. I even sent the camera back to Canon for them to tell me that no, nothing is wrong with the focus system even though I'm constantly getting out of focus images with my L lenses. Yep, even sent the L lenses back to Canon too for them to be check, all with the same prognosis that \"no, nothing is wrong with them.\"-HORRIBLE focusing is really the only con to this camera, but it's a huge con that totally ruins my love and respect for this camera. I'll explain more below.A little story...As I mentioned above, I've been using the MKII for over a year. I've had the focus problems but continued using the camera because I shoot a lot of brides in dark rooms & loved the high ISO capabilities. I had enough images \"in-focus\" for me to continue using the camera, just thought that maybe the issue was me not getting everything in TACK sharp focus.Fast forward to yesterday, when a friend was shooting a promo video for me & used my MKII for the video. It was a just a \"fun\" photo shoot, so I used my 5D to take the portraits while my friend shot video on the MKII. I didn't think anything was out of the ordinary with the images until I looked at the images on my computer. Most of the images were TACK sharp. The colors were super bright, super crisp, super creamy and almost edible. The images were a world's difference from the softness of images from my MKII. Now I know it's not a problem with me or my lenses -- the problem is my MKII and it's beyond HORRIBLE auto-focus system. I told a couple friends about this & they also said they recently did a focus test with their 5D vs. 5D MK II and the 5D came out way ahead. I'm now switching my 5D to be my main camera & my 5D MKII as my backup camera & for use in high ISO situations. Such a bummer and letdown on a $2,000+ camera. As soon as the replacement comes out I'll be ditching this.So, the camera gets 3 stars. One for video, one for ISO, and one for better construction & weather sealing. It is useable and has the potential to produce amazing images, but after looking at images from my 5D, it's just not the best out there.Take my advice and PLEASE wait for the replacement version of this camera. The auto-focus is really unacceptable for professionals -- such a shame to waste the video & other amazing features of this camera.

The instruction manual is not very helpful for people without prior Canon experience.3. The weather sealing on the body does not seem convincing.Considerations:1. At 3.9 shots/sec, it's little bit too slow to be used regularly for sports or action photography. The camera is best for portraits or landscapes.2. The built in mic picks up any little noise from the lens or camera interactions -- you will need to buy an external mic immediately if you want to capture any audio with your video.3.

This camera is far better than any non L-series zoom with the exception of the DO series. Non L primes are OK.There are a lot of comparisons between 5DII and D700/D3 going around.  DXO publishes some excellent tech data on sensor comparisons.  What these show is that in the various test the Canon is 0.5 - 0.3 stops worse than the Nikon at high ISO.  At low ISO (below 400) the Canon is maybe 1.3 stops poorer than the Nikon. Although high ISO dynamic range between the two is nearly line ball!  There are 2 things to say now.  The low ISO figures are irrelevant because the noise cannot be seen at low ISO on any modern DSLR!  The high ISO differences are so small that they nearly make no difference.  In fact if you down convert the Canon's 21Mpx images to the Nikon's 12 Mpx you gain 0.3 of a stop on most tests. Voila! They are then identical!These are two very good cameras.  The Nikon has higher fps.  The Canon has higher resolution. And the Canon has 1080p movies! You choose.Oh! You should disregard the DXO final summary score for the Nikon D3X.  It is complete nonsense.  The individual DXO data graphs on dynamic range, S/N etc all show the D3x is very similar to the 5DII. The final summary score must presumably be an error.  But of course the D3x is ~$7000 and doesn't go to as high ISO as the 5DII or the D700.  The D3 is optically very similar to the D700 but with better weather proofing etc. and a higher weight and price tag.  However, the D3 does NOT have sensor cleaning! I have always regarding sensor cleaning as a must have in DSLRs.Forgot to say: the latest firmware update from Canon has fixed the \"black dots\" and the moire (slight) problems.  These problems were hard to see (narrow parameter sets) but should not have been present.*2 months later: still all good.  No nasties discovered late in the day.  Lots of later reviews confirm what I said.  Slightly poorer low noise at higher ISOs but the difference is going to be hard for the human eye to see in prints - even at the largest sizes.  Also the 5DII has higher resolution than the D700.  The 5DII has very similar sensor performance to the Nikon D3X - line ball - and v similar resolution.

As a previous owner of Canon T1i,7D, and now the 5D mark II,I can say clearly that you DON'T need to \"upgrade\" to 5D Mark II until you REALLY know what you need and what you don't.  5D Mark II is NOT suitable for everyone. Actually, in most conditions, it's just a \"downgrade\" choice especially for 7D owners. For shutter speed, build-in flash, autofocus, metering, menus and a lot of advanced new technical specifications, 5D feels like an old generation toy, it's not even comparable with 7D. I'd suggest that you should seriously consider 7D rather than 5D Mark II, if you are the one who likes shooting sports, social events, family activities, travel and normal landscape pictures. That's say, 7D maybe the BEST camera for 90% photo enthusiasts.  But 5D Mark II is solely for the \"rest of us\" who are searching for the camera of best available picture sharpness and best color capture at an relative affordable price. I'd say 5D Mark II is NOT made for general consumers, is made for serious landscape, architecture, advertising, commercial, publishing photographers and advanced amateurs.  5D Mark II lacks a lot of cutting-edge features which are very important for most customers, if you are one of them, you'll certainly not satisfied with its old generation of functions; but for me, all the cutting-edge features are not as important as 5D mark II's full frame sensor which enables me capture the widest range of lights and colors when I meet the once in a lifetime scenery.  Other than the FF sensor, I think the 2nd most important feature of 5D Mark II is that I can now take full advantage of my L lenses, I don't need any more to consider the 1.6x crop factor which reduces enormously the ultra wide angle features when using 7D.  In short, 5D Mark II's Pros and Cons in my opinion:  Pros: 1. Full Frame Sensor - As good as 1Ds Mark III;  2. Possibility To Take Full Usage of L Lenses At Their Original Focus Range.  3. Very Good Low Light Performance And Usable Higher ISO Until 3200;  4. Much Better Dynamic Range - With just one shoot of RAW you can get a very good HDR.  Cons: Almost All Other Features Are Inferior To 7D even 60D.  So the most important thing before to buy it, ask yourself if you REALLY need 5D Mark II?Update 12/29/2010:  After almost 2 months use of 5D Mark II, I'm absolutely satisfied with its picture quality(sharpness,color saturation, low light performance).

Without a doubt, it is well within the \"good enough for pro work\" and any improvements in future generations of EOS cameras are only icing on the cake.  This also means that f/2.8 and even f/4 is very usable in low light, reducing the need for expensive ultrawide lenses.  The full frame sensor is also very nice.  21 MP provides a lovely sharpness to the images.  Solid construction.  The HD video is a nice plus that I've used a few times, but it isn't a critical feature to me.Cons:  Slow frame rate and poor autofocus make this impossible to use in any sort of action shots.  The autofocus is my biggest complaint, only 9 AF points and they are all pretty poor.  Only the middle one is cross-type, and even it doesn't perform all that well.  If I was to upgrade to the Mark III, this would be the single biggest reason as the Mark III has a far superior AF system.  I'm knocking off a full star for the autofocus alone.  The frame rate is what it is:  as advertised.  Can't knock a star for that, but it is rather slow.  I also don't like the mode selector knob.  It's very very easy to bump and switch modes.  I've done it a lot.  I like the 60D's version which adds a lock button in the center of the knob.  I wish they had done that with the 5D Mark II.  I hear there's an upgrade, but it should be standard.Full frame and high resolution has a tendency to show every flaw in your lenses.  No wiggle room, this camera demands L glass- which is actually a good thing in my opinion.  It makes full use of high quality glass.All in all, quite nearly an ideal camera body.  Very happy with it.  Even though I did knock a star for the autofocus, since price is an issue I still haven't found reason enough to upgrade to the Mark III.  That one star isn't worth the price difference to me.", "Date": "January 3, 2013"}, {"Title": "In love with photography again!", "Author": "Dave Darby \"Husband, Father of 5, Life/Busine...", "ReviewID": "R1HWJ6IREBEMSG", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This camera has been on my list a long time.  My only regret with this camera is that I didn't make the jump sooner.  My previous (now backup) camera is an EOS Rebel XT, so I had AEB and RAW access, though, with the 5D I finally converted to 100% RAW shooting.I still use the AEB quite a bit for HDR photos, though the only drawback with Canons is the 3-shot limit compared to Nikon's 5/7/9.  Not needed for most photos, but there are situations in HDR that would benefit from more exposures.  To compensate, it is really simple to take 3, then adjust the bracket without moving the camera a noticeable amount and add another 3/6 the delete the overlaps in post production.LOVE the HD video though I haven't experimented with it enough to fully appreciate it.  Did an HD shoot where I quickly grabbed some HD video and that was sweet/effortless with all the quality.Obviously I am benefiting from the full sensor and L series lenses.  So nice to shoot in low light, handheld without a flash.  And even my timed exposures need considerably less time, resulting in less movement/greater ability to shoot in wind.  Being on the ocean, wind is almost always a factor.But the BIGGEST JOY I have found with this camera is LIVE VIEW mode.  I use it on nearly every shot and because of it, I now shoot almost exclusively manual focus, especially for landscape/product shots.  I now have utmost control to decide on a small detail to focus on the subjects front/back edge or square in the middle.  This is the first time since the 80/90 days of film that I feel the post-production focus was as tight as I envisioned during the shoot.Last night, I picked up the Rebel to teach the kids and I was amazed how small the Rebel LCD screen was so, clearly, I am happy with the 5D LCD - it's easy to take the size/quality/clarity for granted.I also bought the Zeikos ZE-CBG5DII Multi-Power Battery Pack for Canon 5D Mark II and love it with the 5D.

My arsenal of lenses became temporary museum pieces while I wandered around with a point-and-shoot digital.  While it gave great images, one thing it lacked was the flexibility of interchangeable lenses.I got an urge to start using my lenses again so \"went back to film\" so I could use them on my film cameras.  And that's when I remembered why I went to digital in the first place.  The long story short is that film takes lots of time, costs lots of money, and these days, is not well supported if you want high-end processing, printing, etc.So there I sat, staring at over 20 name-brand, high end lenses and no camera to use them on.  In todays dollars that's a significant investment.  Enter the Canon EOS 5D Mark II.  There are a number of good mount-adapters that enable the use of vintage and not-so-vintage lenses on the camera.  After a little research I was convinced it would work for me.  So I ordered the camera (with kit lens), battery grip, extra battery, memory cards and the lens mount adapter.All the packages arrived on the same day.  It was like the best birthday I ever had.  Within minutes I was shooting images with the kit lens (24~105), and testing the camera with every last one of my vintage lenses and the lens mount adapter.  A couple wide-angle lenses with deep rear elements would not work, but a long list of lenses worked perfectly and very easily.  With the lens mount adapter I purchased, I even get focus-assist!I love the battery grip - it holds two batteries AND comes with a clip so you can use AA batteries in a pinch.The kit lens is wonderful.  It gives a great range of focal lengths - from a super-wide 24mm to a very useful short telephoto 105mm, with a continuous run in between.The autofocus is almost silent - so much so that a Nikon user I handed it to said \"the auto focus isn't working\".  Yes, it was...Gadgets are great and photographers love to talk about them.  But it's the pictures that really matter, right? And that's where this camera rules.  I have put this camera to every test I can come up with - slow shutter speeds hand-held (image stabilization really helps); low light (the ISO range is so wide I can almost say that light isn't an issue anymore); colors (so natural and clean that the images will stun anyone who sees them); and for me, the ability to attach vintage lenses and get auto exposure and assisted focus - a huge money saver for people with high-end vintage lenses.The full-frame image sensor means that all those 35mm lenses you have will still behave the way they did on your 35mm SLR.Check the customer images for a couple examples of what can be done...8/31/2010 - Since purchasing this camera and kit lens almost a year ago, I have added several lenses to the \"kit\".Canon EF 16-35mm f/2.8L II USM Ultra Wide Angle Zoom LensCanon TS-E 24mm f/3.5L II Ultra Wide Tilt-Shift Lens for Canon Digital SLR CamerasCanon EF 70-200mm f/2.8L II IS USM Telephoto Zoom Lens for Canon SLR CamerasI still like my vintage \"manual\" lenses but the real beauty of this camera comes out when paired with lenses like these!", "Date": "October 31, 2009"}, {"Title": "Good Image, Poor Construction", "Author": "J.

I took a couple years worth of classes for Photography in college, but that was nearly 20 years ago AND it was all film based. Still, I've long been obsessed with cameras and photography in general. I sold my old Canon EOS film camera the moment digitals became affordable for us regular folks. Since then I've had a long string of different cameras, but they were all only OK. I always pined for the look I remembered capturing with my old EOS film camera, that to me was photography. Every shot I took looked like a crummy point and shoot vacation image. Fine for trips with the family, but nothing to be taken too seriously. Last year after years of slobbering over the 5D (mark II and precursor) I finally broke down and took the plunge, and haven't regretted it one bit. I LOVE this camera. This is what I remember photography being. Something that can be controlled and worked with, minus all the horrible smelly chemicals. I work exclusively with a 50mm prime F1.4 and the lovely depth of field speaks to me, and allows me to capture images of sublime beauty (to me anyways). I've heard over the years so many times that good photographers can make amazing images even with crummy equipment, while that may be true, for amateurs like me, having amazing tools sure helps a LOT. I'm rarely seen out and about without my camera these days and I have Canon to thank for bringing me so much joy. Highly recommended.", "Date": "September 2, 2010"}, {"Title": "Great camera but light meter and auto-focus could improve.", "Author": "Joe", "ReviewID": "RSYJEVYO1Q94F", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "When I first heard a 21 megapixel camera would be coming out at a reasonable price (ie. not a ridiculous price like A$12,000.00) I couldn't wait to buy it.  My previous camera was the EOS 1V film camera which had under-exposure problems and suddenly died a year after the warranty expired.  I've had the EOS 5DII for three months now and recently took about 300 garden and landscape photos on a trip to Japan using a 28-70mm zoom.  I had to work quickly because a lot of the sites we visited were very crowded.  The 21 megapixels alone make this camera worth it - being able to zoom in and in and in and still use the full resolution with only a bit of sharpening is really something to behold.  However, like my 1V, this camera isn't perfect and I had to fight it to get my shots exposed correctly and in focus.Other people have said that their 5DII's exposures are perfect every time but mine gave inconsistent exposure on nearly every shot I took and it seemed to favour over-exposure rather than under.  If I had used a tripod I could have tried the live view mode with exposure simulation function before shooting - but for hand-held work next time I'll have to autobracket.  None of the exposure modes (Evaluative, Partial, Spot, or Center-weighted metering) seemed to help in my quest to get correct exposure in one shot.  Every photo had to be taken again at least three to four times for me to get the exposure right.  I nearly always had to meter from the brightest part of the scene because of the light meter's tendency to over-expose but with some scenes the bright parts were too bright and I ended up under-exposed.The only downside to using 21 megapixels is that I became aware of auto-focus problems at full resolution.  All of my lenses were either forward or back-focusing (at least when viewed at full resolution).  Although you can fix this problem with the AF Microadjustment function for dedicated lenses like the 50mm f1.4, it will not work consistently across the entire range of a zoom lens (ie. you might be able to get it perfect for wide-angle shots but it will be out of focus on mid to telephoto shots).  If you like pixel-peeping, want super-sharp focus and have the time, I would recommend that you use this camera with a tripod, set the screen to live view mode and focus manually at full resolution because auto-focus is just not accurate at high resolution.Another problem revealed by 21 megapixels is camera shake. In my case I found this particulary when using auto-ISO with aperture priority.  Many of my hand-held shots with the 28-70mm zoom in low light were blurry at full resolution because of the minimal shutter speeds chosen by auto-ISO.  The auto-ISO consistently chooses a shutter speed that is a little too slow for the focal length used in my opinion (ie. for my 28-70 f2.8 zoom, the auto-ISO set the shutter speed to 1/70 of a second when the lens was zoomed to 70mm).  I still got camera shake and blurred photos even though theory says this shouldn't happen if the shutter speed matches the focal length of the lens.  I think Canon need to update the auto-ISO on their larger megapixel cameras so that it chooses a slightly faster shutter speed.  I know a lot of landscape photographers will be very critical of auto-ISO but while travelling I thought this would be a good feature to use to help save time as we often had to move quickly, taking pictures indoors and out under varying lighting conditions and this feature would have been useful - I imagine wedding photographers would be interested too.I think that digital cameras are undergoing a rapid evolution at the moment - on the one hand we have point-and-shoot models and the new \"bridge\" cameras which meter and auto-focus directly from the sensor and on the other we have the older SLR designs which use a mirror to reflect the image to separate auto-focus and exposure chips - a design which worked well back in the days of the first auto-focussing film cameras but which now seems out of date and ill-prepared to handle the new high resolutions on offer.  Which is why Canon and others have added live view as compensation but it still has a way to go I think.Anyway, I still think I will have no trouble getting my money's worth out of this camera in the years to come.** As an update to this review - I took my 5DII to my local Canon service center where they sent if off to check the light meter.  It came back recalibrated and is now exposing correctly and I'm very happy with it.", "Date": "August 1, 2009"}, {"Title": "Easily The Best Camera I Have Ever Owned", "Author": "Tyson Chaplin", "ReviewID": "RAN2F09ARYX3N", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "The Canon 5D mkII is an amazing camera! It takes pictures with a sharpness that I have found hard to match by any other camera and it is an excellent value, even today when it is several years old.I have travelled extensively with my MkII and have taken over 30,000 pics with it. When this body is coupled with Canon's L series lenses, it is one of the best cameras on the market for its price point. Unless you are going to be shooting a lot of movies, do not spend the extra money to get the 5D mk III, it just isn't worth it for still photography.The only downside to this camera is its weight when coupled with some of Canon's bigger lenses. I had my MkII with the 70-200 IS L and the battery grip and the camera weighed just under 9lbs. It isn't super heavy but it gets heavy enough to notice after a day of shooting. But if you are getting into a camera like this, weight is probably not your primary concern.One thing I do suggest is that if you get this camera, stick to Canon's L series lenses. Yes, they are more money but you can tell a difference between L and non-L lenses in terms of picture quality. The photo sensor is good enough that there is a discernible difference in pics between L glass and non-L glass. The one exception to this that I have found is Canon's 50mm 1.4 USM lens. This is a great lens that is also one of the biggest bang for buck pairings with this camera.

I've tested 5D Mark I for a few years but it was too expensive for me, plus it has many flaws that I decided to wait until Canon came out with the upgraded version.  So, when Canon announced it, I pre-ordered it immediately on Amazon and so it arrived a month later.My impression: full frame is a beast that once I use it, I definitely don't want to go back to crop frame bodies any longer because the field of view is larger and what you see is what you get. Furthermore, image quality surpasses 20D in all aspects of it.Pros: full frame, light weight, sealed, great image quality.Cons: Expensive, bulky body, slow sync speed 1/200s, slow focus in low light. The 9-point AF system is slow, outdated.  However, AF system has been redesigned and much more improved in the Canon 5D Mark III so this is no longer an issue.  The way to get around the AF  limitation is to learn how to use single selective focus point. When the subject is framed against strong back lighting, the camera meter will be fooled to focus on the high contrast area and most likely your subject will be out-focused.Despite the AF issue, I've learned to live and master it.  I've shot many great photos of my kids and am still happy with it.  However, its size and weight combined with heavy L lenses are the big drawback when I travel with my kids.If you know what you do, this camera offers plenty of power and quality when it pairs with the best lenses.  However, don't expect the camera will do everything for you.  This camera still have many quirks and limitations and that requires a lot of learning curves and skills to produce the best possible photos.

Since then, I've carried it to the ends of the earth, shooting in rain forests, waterfall mists, deserts, smoky casinos and urban jungles. December 2013 makes five years of dependable service and tens of thousands of images.While the technology of this camera is showing its age, it stands up well to current EOS models. The 5D MKII delivers vivid, detailed and low noise landscapes. I've never needed to brighten an image two stops but the 5D MKII handles a one stop lift with ease. I shoot RAW and expose to the right so I normally reduce exposure in PP a half stop or so. I'm a landscape, travel and macro shooter, so I'm able to work slower and more deliberately than many.I often work in twilight and have found ISO 160, 320, 640 and 1250 to be excellent and well controlled in terms of noise. ISO 200, 400, 800 and 1600 are a bit more noisy so I avoid those settings. And, with careful exposure and noise reduction in PP, ISO 2500 and even 5000 are useable for 12 x 18 prints.I'm heard whining about the 2005 tech AF of the 5D MKII. Indeed, it's not cutting edge and obviously the 6D, 5D MKIII or 1DX will best it for action and low light. With that said, AF rarely misses for me. Even the outer points lock in most light save for really dim conditions. In low light I stick to the center point or use AF assist on a Speedlite. Also, it is helpful to place the AF rectangle on a point of contrast, e.g., eyebrow rather than smooth forehead. And the center point is very sensitive so you can use the lock-AF-recompose technique in almost any light.Finally, after 5 years of use, I can say build quality is excellent. Not a single problem other than I needed a new battery. It's not combat grade but strong enough to take some knocks and keep ticking. I'm writing this review late in the game as the 5D MKII is long discontinued. You can still buy old stock, refurbs and, of course, used. However, if my 5D MKII failed today I wouldn't buy another one unless an extremely good deal, e.g., a new or refurb for $1000 or less. Otherwise, I'd spring for a newer full frame model, e.g., 6D or 5D MKIII. I suspect my 5D MKII has a few more years left and I have no need for more than 21MP, Wi-Fi or dozens of AF points.

Image quality is the main reason I chose the 5D and that definitely is the best part of the camera. I do not shoot any video so I can't comment on that aspect of the camera. There are a few things that can be improved. The continuous shooting speed is SUPER SLOW. I thought it would be slightly slower than my 40D but it feels like I could press the shutter button faster than the burst. Don't plan on using this as your main camera for sports or action shooting (although it is still possible to shoot if you time it at the right moment but it would be so much easier with a faster burst rate). The shutter is also pretty loud. Other DSLRs I have used just make a mirror slap noise but the 5D almost sounds like a film SLR. It has the mirror slap but also sounds like there is film that is winding up really fast. Another small thing is that there is no flash but if you're going to buy a camera like this you are probably going to use a professional flash. I mainly shoot landscapes, food, and some portraits so the negatives about this camera are not a big deal. I would recommend this camera to anyone who wants professional quality landscape, architecture, food, or portrait images (you also need good lenses). For the action shooters, save for one of the 1Ds or get the 7D. It may not perform as well at high ISOs but if you get the 5D, you will be VERY disappointed at the burst rate.

(Note: I am not being biased. I think Nikon makes really wonderful cameras too, though I prefer Canon.)First off, this camera is FAST. It isn't as fast as one of the $5000 professional 1D series cameras, but for half the price, what can you expect? The Mark II is a semi-pro camera that will make an amateur feel like a pro. This camera is fantastic! It's amazingly fast, the ISO performance is staggering, and the full-frame sensor and all 21.1 megapixels of beauty are all you really need to fall in love with this thing over and over again. It pays for itself. There is no price on the shot; if you are debating whether to get this camera or not, I say YES! If you are upgrading from a 5D Mark I, should you upgrade? YES! Are you debating between the 7D and the 5D Mark II? I say to test them both out and see if you prefer the cropped sensor or the full-frame (for me, the full-frame Mark II cannot be beat, though the 7D is also a very nice camera.)Bottom line: just get it.", "Date": "January 10, 2011"}, {"Title": "Fantastic video !", "Author": "Leo", "ReviewID": "R3OTPIJWFYH3CN", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I purchased the Canon 5D for it's video quality, I am really a Nikon user of many years and actually I use it with Nikon lenses. I have found that Canon does tweak images in camera more than Nikon does so I prefer to use Nikon when it comes to stills.Video quality is the reason I got it, I do nature documentary films and used a Panasonic HVX-200 with a 35mm lens adapter to get a more filmic image and the capability of using long Nikon lenses.I did get most of both wishes and it was fun at the beginning but the camera turned into a huge and heavy monster. This along with all the rest of the equipment needed made me quit using the adapter and finally sold the camera.For most of my video needs with a proper camera I now have a HPX-150 and pulled away from P2 and quit the adapter as well.The Canon 5D is not a video cam per se and can't seamlessly be used as one, but the image quality it produces is fantastic and makes one work hard at getting footage with it.You will need to brush up on your technique as you do need to know what you are doing with speed and f stops and ND filters and lighting. The 5D reminds one of film cameras, that once aperture is set up (it runs at 180 deg) it's a shoot / stop one button camera !Should your dilemma be 5D or 7D... go 5D ! The image is more organic and the larger pixel count of the sensor eventually show in terms of better resolution and better low light images.Nikon lenses work perfect and quite cheap adapters are readily available and working with SD cards is great !Cons... no real quality sound, and this is a big con as you will eventually need a portable recorder and sync sound with the one images obtained.You do need to work on the ergonomy since it's designed to be a stills camera and it's awkward to move like a real moving image camera.Hope this helps!", "Date": "August 9, 2010"}, {"Title": "What a great camera", "Author": "K.

High ISO is just great compared to the crop frames. I can use my 100-400mm L in many more situations now because of the ISO performance on this camera as that lens needs good light because it is not very fast. 4 frames a sec is perfectly fine for what I do. The camera is large and heavy compared to a Rebel but for a full frame I think it is quite compact and feels great in my hand. I do not mind walking half the day with the 24-70mm f/2.8L mounted.

Although at times there is simply *too much* bokeh, (or perhaps, that is a subjective statement because I come from an APS-C/Super 35mm background, and thus my eyes and brain have been conditioned to \"favor\" said sensor/film size), the incredible low light performance and nearly noiseless image output is really astounding, even for a 4 year old camera.

With entire films like Rubber (dir. Quentin Depieux), Newlyweds (Dir.

I understand they left this old system in here so it would not totally eclipse the 1dsMKIII but Nikon is putting top notch 3D matrix metering in all of their cameras and fast AF systems as well. This is a bit of a let down. Beyond that the images are resolved well by the processor, better use good glass, and HIGH ISO is handled almost as well as the D3 and D700 which is impressive seeing has how the pixels are much smaller to fit more on the sensor.

I purchased this camera primarily for the Hi-Def video feature.  I do professional video work and I can't say anything negative about this camera.  This camera shoots video strait to an uncompressed Quicktime .mov file.  It is not AVCHD, there is no conversion needed.  These video files can be placed directly on to a Final Cut timeline without any conversion or rendering. (This saves soooo much time. i.e. no log and capture and no log and transfer and no conversion in any way!!)  Picture quality is amazing.  I only wish I could merge the features of the Canon XH-A1 video camera with the video quality and file format of the 5D!!!!  I have never really been interested in still pictures . . . until now.  I took a photo of some friends from 20 feet away, when viewed in photoshop with the zoom feature set to \"actual pixels\" the detail was as if I had used a macro lens from 2 feet away (This is due to the 21 mega pixels).  Everyone who sees the stills is amazed and I have already made money as a professional photographer!! (That's a first!)Ok . . . the only thing about this camera I would change is I would give it XLR inputs and a manual gain control feature and a meter to visually monitor audio levels.  I imagine that if Canon did this they would lose business because no one would need to buy a pro video camera, they could just buy this!  Otherwise, the audio pick up is decent . . . it's good enough to sync with the audio from other cameras, and it worked just fine with a shotgun mic and a wireless lapel mic.", "Date": "May 12, 2009"}, {"Title": "Camera condition was just as described...", "Author": "Hipolito V.", "ReviewID": "R20NLR5UO8X1AB", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "When ordering a used camera sight unseen, there'll always be a knot in the pit of your stomach because you just don't know what to expect, but hope for the best.

I got this Canon 5D mainly for its live-video capture feature. Actually I planned to buy a 7D and did \"purchase\" a 7D kit at $2519 (with Canon 24-105mm and 100-400mm lens) via a *deals* merchant following a sponsored link on Amazon website.  That \"deal\" was too good to be true and it was more or less a scam.  Its salesman tricked me to upgrade from two lens included in the kit to a 17-50mm and a 70-200mm lens at a $4999 price tag (including $600 CPS protection plan). I discovered within 10 minutes after ending the phone call for the modified order (in response to an email from the dealer asked me providing more info to complete my order done on their website) that the lens were made by Sigma rather than Canon.  I probably would have accepted these Sigma lens and the 7D because I just wanted a decent Camera which can shoot good picture as well as video clips under less perfect lighting condition.  But I found that, had I purchased these Sigma lens from Amazon, the Amazon price are only 1/3-1/2 of the listed price I were showed from the dealer's website. I tried to call and email that dealer to cancel the order but no one answered my calls, so I thought it is a fraud and closed my credit card account immediately.  But that merchant does exist and it shipped the package to my house even after I clearly told them \"consider the order canceled unless I get an explanation and you get my confirmation\"! Later when I try to return the package, they first tried to trick me to open the package (which I refused); then they offered me a $700 credit if I accept the package, but I already decided to stop dealing with that merchant because they cheat.  I take the unopened package back to UPS store and reject it.Make a long story short, after that unhappy experience and reading these reviews previous owners wrote, I purchased a Canon 5D Mark II Kit (including a 24-105 lens) from Amazon. I also got a Canon 50mm F/1.4 lens, a backpack, two filters, and a Canon flash (50mm lens and flash were shipped by B&H;). Total cost was much less than I would have paid to that bogus *deal* merchant.I used this Canon 5D camera and the zoom lens on a hiking trip this weekend. The picture quanlity is really great! Even in the \"auto\" mode, I was able to take better portait and landscape with nicer tone, vivid color, and best of all, with clearity and details that the old Rebel Xti could not deliver.  I also shot a short HD video with my son playing piano, and the result is so much better than the Panasonic Lumix (which is a nice point & shot camera) we have been using for video capture in the past.So far I am very satisfied with this new Camera and good service from Amazon.

Seems that they were strong competitors and Nikon just stopped \"playing\" while Canon pushed ahead. Anyway... your loyalty should be to your art and your photos... not some brand name.  Right?Look at this... the Ultrasonic Motor (USM) (in Canon lenses)... a theory on paper till Canon took it and implemented it in a practice in their cameras... \"dead silent\"(Public candid shots -- no one can hear you are focusing on them). This camera even has a silent shutter mode! Just think... no more constitutionally clueless people thinking they have exclusivity to their own image in a public setting trying to infringe on your 1st Amendment asking, \"Did you just take my picture?!!\" LOLBiomimetics... reverse engineered nature--God's design... Canon does this... the L series II lenses are based on reverse engineered Moth eyes to counter flaring!This camera is a piece of the same... incredible. I got one... have used it for 6 months and I am totally FLOORED.  Focus is dead on... features are incredible and I am striving to learn and use every single one! A few I will mention... custom white balance reference (get the Mennen white cap or cheaper model her... as low as $2). Digic 4 processor can do some darkroom work on-the-fly... lightening (burnishing) dark area to bring out details. Lens distortion compensation... the camera knows what Canon lens you have attached and if you are using a wide angle, etc. it can automatically compensate for vignetting (darkening in the corners) and barrel/pincushion distortion! The camera can do various types of \"bracketing\"... here is something that blows me away:  Say you want to take a long depth of field shot and keep the foreground and background all in focus.  Say... your kids on the playground with other kids... you want to get all the kids in focus from just a few feet away to infinity. Impossible you say?  What you do is set focus bracketing to take a shot every so many meters... I use Hyperfocal Distance calculations to do this based on the 6.4um CMOS CCD pixel size... may take 10 shots or so and \"stack\" them to get a paradoxical photo where the entire photo is in focus. The impossible can be done with this camera!  Great bokeh (soft out of focus backgrounds) when you want them too.I put the 24mm L-series f/1.4 USM II lens on this camera as a \"leave on\" walkabout lens. It is prime focus... edge to edge sharper than anything I have ever seen.  I also put a Hoya DMC 77mm UV filter on that to protect the \"eyeball\" lens on the front. Comes with a tulip hood and great post production processing software that is amazing in itself.Now... you might read about Auto Focus (AF) problems... naught!  (unless you get a bad copy... then send it back).  But the AF is dependent on your settings and light conditions, the lens attached, and also the target you are focusing on. High contrast lines that are brightly lit focus faster and how fast depends on the lens you are using. When you get the camera test this to get this question behind you. Put a lousey lens on this camera and you may have slow focus.  At f/1.4 the camera will AF on things I can't see with my own eyes (ISO to 6400...and beyond).I think it is always best to buy the body... then the lens that fits your particular need. Full frame... 35mm CMOS format and the camera will do 1080p video too at 30 fps (with fast CF Flash Memory).  Incredible... simply incredible.  I don't do Nikon anymore... they have a lot of catching up to do... oh yeah... one more thing:Canon has open sourced its scripting language so that there is a Canon Hacker Development Kit (search CHDK on Google). There is talent world wide working on very very cool scripts (custom programs that run inside your camera) to customize your camera to your specific application! One I saw recently was a script that looks for pixel changes and reacts. You can set your camera on a tripod on a flower bud about to open and instead of taking a shot ever hour... take shots only when the camer recongizes pixels changes of X amount.

I am so disappointed. I do not know what has happened to Canon recently - but when you buy two brand new camera bodies of different models and you have to send them BOTH in just a month after ownership with the same exact problem - there's a problem. I ordered both this Canon 5D Mark II and an EOS 7D the same day for use in our department. Both were upgrades from older models that definitely went through 200,000 shutter clicks minimum - and we wanted higher ISO capabilities for shooting in low light without a flash.I own a 30D personally and we already had a 50D and 20D in our department. Never any major problems with them and they STILL work. A former employee dropped the 20D really good, knocking the viewfinder off kilter by just enough so that what you see in frame is a few millimeters from what you really get - but shoot - we're just thrilled it still works.Fast forward to the purchase of the brand new 7D and 5D Mark II. I was surprised how LOUD the 5D Mark II was. A much more expensive camera than we've ever had in our department - yet so loud - it would scare away wildlife or alert others in a quiet room to your shutter clicks much more than any previous model.About 2-3 months into ownership, my boss tells me that when she used the 7D, it started giving error messages about the battery. I couldn't reproduce the errors at first. It was completely random. I turned it on and off - everything seemed to be fine. I traded cameras with her and carried it with me to several photo shoots until the problem manifested.In the middle of taking photos - the shutter release just STOPS WORKING. The LCD panel says \"Cannot communicate with battery. Use battery anyway?\" OMG. Are you freaking serious, Canon? I'm trying to take a freaking photo. You bet your sweet assets I want to use the battery! You have to turn the jog wheel to OK to let the camera know, \"Yes, darling, I for reals want to take the photo - that's why I've got my finger on the shutter release.\" That's not enough, though - because during a shoot, it would keep doing this over and over and over again. I get that the camera needs to know how much power the battery has left to give an accurate indicator atop the camera on how much juice you've got left... but there is a serious problem here.I downloaded firmware updates and installed them all to the camera - got it up to date and the problem abated for a few days and came back with a vengeance. I googled the problem and TONS of people are having this issue... with both models - this one and the 7D. Supposedly, this is a problem when using a non-Canon battery. Well - guess what? We had the original battery by Canon that shipped with the camera in the camera body - and it was still doing this.I sent the 7D off to repair and by the time it came back, the 5D Mark II started doing the same thing. Both units were still under warranty.When the 7D AND the 5D Mark II came back from repair, the paperwork that came with it claimed they replaced only the PC card inside and that they 'cleaned' the viewfinder. The viewfinders were not merely CLEANED - they were REPLACED. They looked completely different - everything in the viewfinder was different. Not a settings issue, either... and the 5D Mark II wasn't clean. There was crap in the viewfinder that wasn't in there when I sent it off.Well, fast forward again to last week - when only 1.5 years into ownership, and about 1 year since the last repair - and it's doing the same thing. Cannot communicate with battery. Hello, Canon! My camera does not need to 'poke' a friend on facebook. It does not need to make a blog entry. I don't care if it can't communicate with the battery or if the power indicator is not reliable when I'm in the middle of a shoot. I have other back-up batteries. Our older cameras - 20D, 30D, 50D - NEVER have had these problems. EVER. Only these newer models. Something is really sucking in Denmark and I've completely lost my faith in this brand. Along with our new camera bodies, I had also ordered a 28mm-300mm zoom lens. It was defective out of the box and I had to send it back for a replacement. What is going on with Canon? Did someone up the chain start making some cost-cutting decisions that made quality control or just plain quality suffer?I just got a notification from Canon - even though I cited in the repair request that this is a recurring problem with their products that is well documented online and that we've already had this problem repaired - they are quoting us over $250 to repair THEIR PROBLEM. I did not drop the camera or play with it in the rain. This is a manufacturing/design defect.I no longer trust Canon products. I will NEVER buy another Canon product.

The view finder is _much_ bigger and brighter. I still feel my father's canon film slr (FtB) has a better viewfinder, but this is a big step up over the cramp and dim viewfinder in the T1i. This is especially noticeable for someone wearing glasses, as the extra distance often removes the stats on the bottom of the viewfinder from view.2. Better ISO performance. When I view at 100% crop, the difference isn't that great. But when viewing the whole image, I can tell this gives me 2-3 stop of extra ISO before the noise ruins the image. So now I can confidently go from 800 on the T1i to 3200-6400 on the 5D as my default indoor/low light shoot. It's very necessary as I just went from a 17-50 2.8 to a 17-40 f/4 lens, so I lost a stop of light along the way.Otherwise, I think the AF is a little worse, it can't focus in low contrast very well, even on f/1.4.

The camera feels non-responsive when using outer AF points (I'm coming from 40D, which has cross-type sensors for all AF points).* The CF card door creaks & is flimsy---this affects the grip.* The camera is quite heavy. Weight becomes a problem especially with heavier lenses (24-70L and 85 f/1.2L), where you get blurry shots more frequently (again, compared to xxD series cameras).* Lack of pop-up flash is bothering (although I have an external unit); If Nikon can do it, why can't Canon?* Lack of face-detection auto-focus during video recording.

There is a very detailed review that is well organized and like him, I will probably update this later.The product improvements are right in line with what I was looking for in improvements from the superb classic 5D. Just be careful where you buy it.As another reviewer has noted, the prices some retailers are advertising are outrageous. The Canon suggested price is the $2,695 for the body. For the Body plus the 24-105 kit lens, an L f/4, the priceis $3,495. There is an advertiser who is claiming the street price is 4,495. That does not speak well of Amazon's merchant program which can be very good.So buy one from a good seller, enjoy it and come back and write a good review. But don't get screwed on price by this disreputable people.A neutral comment on the 5D specs saying that it's lightweight. That's a relative question. Compared to the 1D series, it is relatively light. Compared to the classic Nikon F, the Olympus SLRs, etc. it is not light. It's more on a par with the later series of Nikon pro cameras. You won't find this a burden if you're 25 years old. You will tolerate it with some pleasure given the quality of the image. I usually use the 24-70 and 16-35 f/2.8.

I'm keeping this lens and I'm happy with it. (The 5D Mark II provides nice support as well -- no complaints).The build quality of this lens is excellent -- completely satisfied.Center sharpness is excellent across the zoom range.Edge sharpness is fair to occasionally disappointing, but not worse than expected.Vignetting is pronounced at the 24mm end with noticeable distortion but correctable.CA (red/green) is most obvious at the 24mm end and pretty bad at the edges, again not worse than expected and at least partially correctable. I was very pleased to see no center CA even under stressful conditions.Auto focus speed is impressive.The built in IS is icing on the cake. I was able to use it to advantage right away and not raise the ISO.

If you want your images to look like a Thomas Kincaid painting, you may as well be using a Rebel.I leave the focus point at center. I dislike how easy it is to shift your focus point accidentally and spoil a shot. I check the histogram and highlight blowout indicator. I find I quite often have to give a minus 1/3 to a full stop of underexposure, annoying, but not a show-stopper. It suits my slow deliberate style of shooting. I frequently shoot at RAW to be sure I'm not blowing out highlights, but mostly to take advantage of this camera's fantastic image quality. Matrix metering seems to produce identical results to Center-Weighted Averaging.I collect my RAWs in a folder and covert them to DNG's in the free Adobe DNG converter.An added bonus for me is that full frame lets my 24, 28 and 35 be true wide angles. Adapters are available to let me use the fantastic Olympus OM 24mm f 2.8, Nikkor 28mm f 2.8 and Leica R 35mm f2.

All that Nikon has at this level are full-frame bodies with only 12 megapixels. Come on! Film's equivalent = 20 to 36 megapixels, not half, which is 12.

The Canon body will record what it sees, and you tweak it as a RAW file. That's why a D90's colors looks so much more vivid right out of the camera. Nikon's jpeg images are stunning, while Canon's jpegs are a little drab by comparison. And the Canon...well, again, the images have to be worked up in a digital darkroom to look just as vivid, or low-key or whatever you want to express.Did you know that you can use Nikon, Pentax K-mount, M39 and M42-mount lenses on your Canon? Yes. Search for them here at Amazon.com, or the web!The 5D Mark II shutter is quieter than most Nikon dslr's.Is the Canon 5D MkII equal to the Nikon D3X? Not even close. The 24.5 megapixel D3X is years ahead of its time. The 5D MkII cannot hold a candle to the D3X in terms of overall image quality.

It is a wonderful camera that produces velvety images that are very sharp with accurate color rendition.  I was hoping that the 5D Mark II would produce the same quality images, and I would be able to make much larger prints.  The improvements made to the Mark II are very nice.  I particularly like the additional information shown in the view screen.  More options for how the controls operate are also nice.  Expanded ISO is good.  I doubt I would use the video, but it's a nice feature.  My first surprise was that the image on the LCD was quite dark.  I thought the camera was underexposing until I found I could adjust the brightness of the LCD.  That helped, but I was never able to get what I thought was an accurate view of my image.  So the large, bright  LCD was good for gross level reference only.  Perhaps that's good enough, but why bother with making it larger and brighter if you must wait to see an accurate image in Lightroom?  I did not see any improvement with focus speed or accuracy.  I did many 1 - 1 comparisons with my 5D - same lens, same exposure, ISO, same everything.  While the images were often close, I believe the Mark II has a bit softer focus and bit more contrast.  I was not able to \"dial in\" the same smooth gradient of color as with the 5D, and with sharpening, the Mark II appeared more crunchy - more digital.  Does the  5D Mark II make excellent images?  Absolutely.  Is there a learning curve with every new advanced camera?  Of course. Could I eventually adapt a new workflow to get the same quality images as I get with my original 5D?  Perhaps.  Can I get high quality, large prints from my original 5D?  Yes.  For me the Mark II did not have significantly better image quality than my 5D; in fact, I thought the quality was not as good.

For a camera this price you should be able to chose how many exposure you want and a much greater range of stops. Infuriating!In manual mode, Auto ISO doesn't work. You can only choose a manual ISO setting. Very very very very very very very very VERY annoying.Auto ISO (available in any non-manual mode) will only go up to 3200. If you want higher than this you have to set it manually. For the price I want to be able to set max/min limits. MADDENINGLongest shutter you can set is 30s. I know all camera manufacturers do this but it is just nuts. There is no reason why you shouldn't be able to set 60s, 120s, 4 hours, 2 days, for this price.All in all this a pretty basic piece of equipment with an excellent sensor.

I also tried to get rid of the hissing noise using software like Audacity, it worked, but not without loss.If this is a $500 camera I wouldn't complain, but with a $2500 price tag I expect something better. Everything else worked very well except the audio quality, this is sort of like dressing up a beautiful, sexy girl with a smelly pants, Why would Canon do that?Added March, 2012:Discovered three solutions to my audio problem:1 JuicedLink. This is a preamp designed specifically for DSLR, turn your camera AGC off and lower the mic level to lowest setting, then crank up JuicedLink amplifier. But this costs you at least $300 + Mic2 FIIO E3: This is actually a headphone amplier, but works on 5D too. Not as good as JuicedLink but cost only $10 on ebay. There are demo videos on youtube3 If you are ok with recording sound in a seperate track and mix it with the video later on, you could always use device like Zoom H4N", "Date": "February 29, 2012"}, {"Title": "Soft focus problems even Photoshop can't clear up!", "Author": "Maui Mike", "ReviewID": "R3GV5TY0SBZRAW", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "After several years of reliable service from my old Canon EOS Rebel body, I was ready to move up to a \"pro level\" body when the 5D Mk II came out.

After a couple of months of testing and comparisons with my old Canon body, I was VERY disappointed with the 5D MkII's output: EVERY PHOTO I TOOK, regardless of mode (AF and MF), turned out to be poorly focused, so much so that I couldn't even compensate for it in Photoshop. MY old Rebel EOS body (less than half the body-only price) produces much CLEARER images. I went back to using the older body and am returning the 5D MkII to the retailer for either a trade-in or heavy service work to correct whatever the problem is with the optics.

Canon's 5D Mark II has dampened my enthusiasm for going into the full frame world.Fully understanding that the Mark II has a less densely packed sensor than do cropped frame sensors, it is natural to anticipate that the Mark II images will be a little less sharp.  Of course, the trade off was supposed to be that the larger Mark II sensor would allow for greater enlargement without pixilation or noise while delivering a flattering portrait image.  That was the theory.It must be assumed that my copy was defective and therefore not typical of Mark II quality overall, nonetheless the fuzziness of so many of the images was grossly disappointing.  Originally guessing that maybe the 24-105 f4 L was the culprit I purchased additional lenses (e.g. 50mm f1.8, 70-300, 28-70).  Some improved the sharpness situation (which did not speak well for the f4 L), and some did not.  Even making the AF micro-adjustments did not help.Ultimately, I concluded that the AF was performing erratically.  That problem coupled with an apparently very soft copy of the f4 L and the less-dense full frame sensor, the net outcome was a great number of unusable out-of-focus images.  This was particularly acute on shots beyond 15 feet.What are my five Mark II disappointments?  Defective AF, overly soft copy of the 24-105 f4 L, heavy weight of the Mark II, no real gain over the T2i in image quality when enlarging images, and the loss of my esteem for the quality control efforts of Canon on their professional line.However, Canon should get credit, in the form of 2 stars, for making a less expensive full frame DSLR.  They also get some credit for the bright viewfinder on the Mark II and its large LCD.I have returned the Mark II and its companion f4 L lens (my appreciation to Amazon for their integrity and standing behind their sales).  Instead of upgrading to the full frame line I am just going to buy another T2i (through Amazon) and hope that it will also be as tack-sharp as the one I already own.  Of course the good part of this experience is that the EF lenses I bought for the Mark II are still useful on the T2i because of Canon`s foresight in making the EOS mounts substantially interchangeable.", "Date": "February 2, 2012"}, {"Title": "Amazon gets no more business from me", "Author": "mavn \"Rand Fan\"", "ReviewID": "R20AP10GNULDNJ", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I pre-ordered a Canon 5D2 on September 17.I emailed Amazon on October 25 asking about the camera's ETA.Amazon replied with an apology and stated that they would upgrade my shipping to next day when the camera was received by Amazon and was ready to ship.

I remember the same rush with price gouging by Amazon and other distributers when the XTi and XSi first became available; much less noticeable because they are lower priced cameras. It is obvious to me, at least, that the presence of price gouging taking place now over the Canon 5D is in part due to the manufacturers marketing stratagem.  Such stratagem, however, may under the present economic conditions seriously back-fire.  I was considering purchasing a 5D Mark II to add to my arsenal of equipment, but what about the \"black spot issue\",  surfacing reports by new owners that the 5D Mark II picture quality is not equal to that of the original 5D even with the greater megapixel count, and adding a marginally usable video capability to what purpose?  I've growing doubts about the 5D Mark II besides a profound dislike for such marketing stratagems that creates superficial demand etc. and it appears others share the same concerns.

Note: (body only) Amazon price is 2,699 with super saver shipping and after tax (NY) totals $2,914.92...``````````I must admit to have placed an ordered for a 5D Mark II recently, myself.  For the following reasons;``````````1) The \"black dot\" phenomenon appears to have been resolved during manufacturing before shipping. ``````````2) While some owners of the original 5D feel the Mark II's image isn't as fine as the originals', tests by periodicals are reporting that image quality is even better then that of the 1Ds Mark III, (of course there remain many reasons why the 1Ds is a superior camera, for me, most of all the advanced AF and metering system).  ``````````3) With all the Canon equipment I have besides camera bodies it's impractical to switch over to Nikon besides Zeiss prime lenses for example are beginning to become available for Canon EOS cameras with EF bayonet mounts.  ``````````4) A use for a 21.1 megapixal camera.  (note: Eight megapixal is more then fine for most photo work.  But for oversize prints and a lot of playing with RAW images a larger megapixal camera is desirable.  And, for commercial reproduction, four color offset litho printing for example, at least a 12 megapixal image is required, with a need for even greater megapixil images for high quality and large to huge reproductions).  ``````````5) My use for a 21.1 camera dose note require AF and in camera metering, I've other cameras for such work (I'm sure the 5D Mark II's AF and meter are probably just fine, but I've become accustomed to working with a 1D and 1Ds and the AF and metering systems of the lesser Cannon camera models, to me seem totally inadequate now).  6) Price; to be honest I can't afford the 1Ds Mark III at present but I can afford the 5D Mark II, now...!  (I have a feeling that a 1Ds Mark IV is on the horizon with it's image quality tweaked at least to equal the 5D Mark II's or more likely surpass it.  I think I may wait for it before purchasing another 1Ds). ~~~~~~ For the uses I have in mind the only real draw-back for me is that the 5D Mark II must be run on batteries, a Canon BG-EG Battery Grip is going to be a must have with extra sets batteries at the ready.``````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````addendum 4/6/09:  I learned of the Canon ACK-E6AC Adapter Kit for the 5D Mark II, from members of Canon Forums and have ordered this AC adapter.  This adapter removes the last vestiges of reservation I had, had when I first considered purchasing a 5D Mark II.  Like with 1D and 1Ds cameras, this adapter allows the 5D Mark II to be powered by AC power, which saves costly batteries during long hours of in studio work while using a tripod and also during the long hours when the camera is connected to a computer for downloads, etc.~~~~~ By the way, the superior picture quality as reported by periodical reviews is true, at least my own use of the camera would in my opinion suggest it to be so. ~~~~~ At this point if it were possible I'd change my star rating of the camera to a four and a half or maybe even a five.

I decided to get back into photography and purchase the Canon D5 Mark ll.

My 10year old Sony 5.0 mega pix takes better photos.This Camera is not for a person that is a beginner or not knowledgeable in Photography. The HD video is good quality, however unless you use a Tripod or compensating lense, the video is shakey on playback.I was very disappointed in this camera.", "Date": "June 22, 2010"}, {"Title": "Wonderful Camera", "Author": "B.

The is my third DSLR and it is my first full frame camera.  For the amount of money I spent and for being an Apple iPhone users for the past five years, I thought Canon would make the UI easier for users.  This camera was designed by people who obviously were not thinking out side of the box.  I would recommend Canon create a simply to use UI for smartphones and relate all user preferences and commands via the smart phone to the camera.  I would love to simply speak to Siri and ask her to take my voice commands and communicate to the camera using USB, Wifi, or Bluetooth methods. The picture data would also be stored on the smartphone instead of the camera.  That way, pictures can be easily sent to your Facebook, Twitter, or blogs.  I am currently getting over 8 MBPS upload speed with AT&T;'s LTE system.  This means sending huge amount of data is very possible right now.Some of you may laugh at my review.
