{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Great package deal!", "Author": "invisible", "ReviewID": "RBVG5T698RBO4", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I really liked this package deal with all the items needed for the beginner who is getting started in digital SLR photography. The camera has settings very similar to those of other Canon cameras, so the learning curve is very fast, especially with the auto focus lenses.The only problem was the 75-300mm Canon telephoto lens had a factory defect - debris between its lens elements but the seller was VERY fast in shipping a replacement lens. (Don't be hard on Canon about this. I've seen similar debris inside a thousand dollar American made rifle scope so I know this happens to other brands.)", "Date": "August 10, 2012"}, {"Title": "Good price!", "Author": "City Hunter \"City Hunter\"", "ReviewID": "R2VWQ0HN6WAP89", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "A very good combination camera set for beginning wantabe photographers.  I bought this set for my daughter.  It is versatile enough for many situations.

I have used the many camera settings to take pics of my daughters basketball games in the sports mode, it is fantastic.  This camera was recommended to me by my friend who is a professional photographer and I am so happy he did.  The price of this camera on Amazon was unbeatable when I bought it.  599.00 for package deal including zoom lens, wide angle lens, filters, sd card with all necessary adapters and cables, tri pod (which is light weight but works), bag, extra battery and so much more.  I couldn't touch this camera locally for less than 1000.00 with all of the extras.  With this camera, I feel like a pro and with the results I'm getting, pretty soon I'm going to tell people I am!

I had been looking at the T3i and so not quite what it has in video, but I like the set up and its easy to use.  I like to shoot with all manual settings, but if I hand it to someone who doesn't know how, its easy to set on auto and they take great pics too.", "Date": "December 29, 2012"}, {"Title": "Good deal!", "Author": "Jpa092", "ReviewID": "R38ZHABW06TFS", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "This purchase was a very good one!

The first one I bought to start photography.  The user interface is great and very easy to use. I chose this thinking it was 18 mp but it was 12.2 but it still looks ok..Pros: ease of use. Lightweight and takes good photos of things like wildlifeCons: the mp first off was always a prob for me. The t3i was a little more but I have a friend who has had his for 2 years and loves it. The build is so.....\"plasticy\" according to Kai on digitalrev's youtube review. Its just not a good keeper.its the kind of camer you learn tp use and then get rid of quickly. The camera just doesn't hold to anything I need anymore.now that I know how to take good photos its become a nuisance to have because the quality isn't what I want anymore. I'm now looking at the 7D which is so much better than this also compared by digitalrev.  Again great for someone starting off though. You should consider this as a low budget buy but the t3i would be better if you can get it.So ill probably use this as a back up camera in case my 7D craps out but the package it came with was great .you get the kit lens plus a 70 -300 and a bunch of accessories. Would recommend for beginner definitely not professional.", "Date": "December 3, 2012"}, {"Title": "Amazing", "Author": "glorizons", "ReviewID": "R2OYDG2BA1LILN", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This was a very good deal. The price was so minimum if compared to purchasing each item separately. Props to the seller! I love my new toy. The case strap was slightly torn but that was the least of my worries. The camera functions properly as do all the lenses. The tripod may seem a little flimsy when used to the biggest height but being short I tend to use it on a notch shorter so it is okay.
