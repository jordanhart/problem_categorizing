Oh and by the way it came with instructions in Chinese!Had a problem finding the code to install it as it's not the master code - you have to use an installers code which is different. Once I found the code (which my security company didn't have)I was able to install it. NOTE - you must install it in group 01 - there are instructions floating around the internet to install it in 10 WHICH IS WRONG - if you install in 10 - your system will search for it even if you take the keychain out of the house and you will get a system malfunction.", "Date": "February 17, 2011"}, {"Title": "Poor battery life", "Author": "Paul C.

I've had it for less than one year and am on my third battery. Perhaps some button is being constantly pushed when it is in my pocket, but my wife's has the same issue. If the buttons are so easy to be activated while in pockets or purses, then it is poorly designed for use as a key fob. With fresh batteries it works well and is a real convenience. But it is annoying to have to change the batteries so frequently.", "Date": "April 14, 2014"}, {"Title": "Great Keyfob replacement for Simon XT.", "Author": "NJ Contributor \"Eddie\"", "ReviewID": "R2TH8UOWCW7I43", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "My wife's keyfob broke after some heavy use and I was in need for a quick replacement but didn't want to spend a lot of money on the OEM. This unit met my needs at perfection.Unit arrived quickly by Amazon's Vendor DG Surplus and I had it setup within 5 minutes.The instructions for the Simon XT were found in the web and I recommend you search for your specific system as they tend to differ.This unit supports multiple systems so the instructions will be different.For the Simon XT- Cycle thru the menu and select 'System Programming'- Enter Code (Make sure to enter the Installer Code - for Simon XT is 4321)- Cycle thru until you find Sensors- Hit the Sensors option, then Learn Sensors- Select the option given for trip sensor- On the remote, press the lock/unlock button simultaneously- Thereafter, make sure the trip sensor is on Grp 1.All set.", "Date": "January 28, 2014"}, {"Title": "BAD PRODUCT", "Author": "Mike", "ReviewID": "R1OR1H66JAYGN7", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "Even after I emailed the seller on this product to ask if it would fit with my system AND he told me \"sure, no problem......It doesn't work.
