{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Bower vs. Neewer Grip for 3100", "Author": "Jason Didday", "ReviewID": "R1KVY73HT0L4ME", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I bought both the Bower and the Neewer NEEWER NEW Professional Vertical Battery Grip Holder for Nikon D3100 SLR Digital Camera battery grips and thought I would pass along the comparison to others who might be debating which one to buy.First off, its important to note that at this time, Nikon does not offer a grip for the 3100 and there is no indication that they will.  So aftermarket products are all we have to choose from.  Contrary to popular belief, these are not the same grips - they are very different and the Bower costing almost 3x that of the Neewer. - Both are made in China and both require the cable to activate the vertical shutter release button. - The Bower has a much more substantial, professional feel to the plastic, but neither are as high quality as the Nikon body. - The Bower has a lower profile; the Neewer is 5mm taller. - The Bower's cable is slightly shorter (which is a good thing as it fits better) and thicker which indicates to me, higher quality. - The Bower grip slightly curves and then tapers on the bottom of the grip (when held vertically) which I think looks better than the larger rectangular shape of the Neewer. - The Bower has a wheel to lock the grip to the body that is similar to the wheel Nikon offers on its OEM grips (for other cameras); the wheel on the Neewer is smaller. - The Neewer has a rubber grip on the front side of the grip which I liked; the Bower has nothing. - The Neewer can hold the original Nikon battery cover (which you remove when you install the grip) inside the grip itself - which is nice if you are prone to misplacing small things like that. - The bottom of the Bower has a ribbing similar to the bottom of the Nikon body; the Neewer has nothing. - The Bower has an on/off button for the grip - which I do not completely understand; the Neewer doesn't. - The Bower comes with an infrared remote, which is a nice bonus; the Neewer does not have the remote. - The Bower states on the box that it has \"mode adjustment wheel\" on the grip - which it does not actually have.Ultimately, even though the Bower cost 3x more than the Neewer, I decided to stay with the Bower.  This is because the plastic and overall build quality is slightly better with the Bower, and the smaller profile fits more to the \"smaller\" nature of the 3100 than the Neewer.  I can't say its 3x better, and frankly, I think I would've been happy with the Neewer had I never seen the Bower.Hope this helps!", "Date": "December 1, 2011"}, {"Title": "Fake", "Author": "ELHERPHA", "ReviewID": "R32OES7JOGLYVU", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "Product arrived totally different than the one your see in the picture,,take careit has only a vertical shutter button and there is no any other controls on this grip, again be aware of this fake photo", "Date": "January 14, 2012"}, {"Title": "Don't spend on this one...", "Author": "dookie", "ReviewID": "R3AU3EFF7XDDTD", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "Cheap Chinese grip.

This item says and shows that you can make additional adjustments from the grip but this is false. This does not have a grip on it like the camera its actually cheap plastic. Knock off Bower product that is sold at Best Buy. I am so mad about this purchase, I was really looking forward to this product. It actually does work but its cheap feeling and does not do everything that $75 it is asking. Just go to Best buy and buy the real one.  I am sending this crap back, and getting a refund.

Still need the cable to activate the camera from the handle, and this one doesn't even have the little cutout on the post to store the door you have to take off. Although the advertiser did not mention this it is on the box that there is an mode adjustment wheel on the handle like there is on the camera for whatever function you would use it for (aperture or exposure). The only thing better about this one over the Neewer model is that the thumb screw wheel is larger and tightens better. Is that worth the extra $40??...nope!Does it work? YesIs it worth the extra money? NopePS: additional info listed on 9/11/13 Something I just found out about this grip and why it is not as good as the Neewer model is this one you have to have the original battery for nikon in the right hand slot and a generic can go in the left hand. When my meter would start reading battery low and I pulled the right battery (nikon) out the camera lost power and came back and said battery not usable with camera because it does not have the chip. Yet take the left battery (generic) out and now my battery meter says full because it is now reading the Nikon battery. So unlike the Neewer grip you must always have a nikon battery in the grip and in the right hand side. The Neewer grip once you power the camera with a nikon battery you can put all generic batteries in and use them as long as the camera never loses power. Once the power has gone dead you will once again need the nikon battery to repower.Now that I know this I would rate this grip at a 1 star, I don't have any idea how they figure you get extended use out of the camera with this setup.  Save your money and buy the Neewer or another brand.", "Date": "August 29, 2013"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": null, "Features": null, "Name": null, "ImgURL": null, "ProductID": "B005OSTVSA"}}
