{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Best camera", "Author": "SruliG", "ReviewID": "R2C60H3BXFUT8Y", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "was a great decision.Based partly on the reviews here, I bought the olympus sz-20, and played with it for several hours, initially shooting about 150 stills and about 10 minutes of video. I settled on the  because I wanted a reliable and solid point and shoot camera, where the Auto feature would do all the work. I admit I'm no photography pro, and I certainly don't have the time, patience, or inclination to fiddle with all the interminable and esoteric photographic settings, nor did I want a bulky camera to lug around.The video looks very good, especially on a hi-def monitor . And I have to admit that having a zoom feature on hi-def video was a strong selling point for me. The tiny stereo microphone works excellent, and like all other similar cameras, picks up the ubiquitous wind sounds. You should also be aware that these hi-def videos take up a lot more file space on your SD cards than \"mere\" DVD quality.I compared one or two pics on the olympus sz-20 to the same shots taken at the same time on my older Canon Powershot A710IS (12 vs. 7 megapixels) and there was a huge difference in the quallity.  but the increase in quality.As claimed, the olympus sz-20  does indeed take great shots in lower light due to the flash option.another plus of the olympus sz-20 is seperate button for shooting videos.", "Date": "May 7, 2012"}, {"Title": "Good Camera For its Money", "Author": "jorge", "ReviewID": "R1JV3VJK77HMNJ", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "we bought this camera and have had a great experience so far, shoots beautiful pictures the 12.5 wide X optical zoom really helps, we bought it a year ago at best buy for $299.00 we find it in equivalent to the Nikon L120", "Date": "February 27, 2012"}, {"Title": "Love it!

Great features and good HD.  Olympus is one of the top brands.  3D Photos, what more do I need to say!?  The wifi is awesome and its nice to have the auto face feature too.", "Date": "August 23, 2012"}, {"Title": "Great camera", "Author": "Divaphoenix \"divaphoenix\"", "ReviewID": "R1DZXID11MLH24", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I was looking for a digital camera with HD video recording. I came across this Olympus camera at Walmart. It was about 40% off at the store. I have always been a fan of Olympus products, I owe an E 500 and some Olympus lenses. So, for the price and knowing Olympus quality I decided to buy it.It was a good investment! The camera is compact, light and easy to manage. The picture quality is amazing and the colors are vivid and beautiful. You have a bunch of picture options to work with. The HD video quality (720) is really good for what I use it. I shoot video blogs and voice lessons that I upload on Youtube. For that purpose the quality and sound are just right there.The close up (macro) setting is good and it has kids and pets features for those in motion, sports, landscape, night shot, auto eye fix, you can do panoramic shots, and it has some cool filters and shooting sets. You can crop and do some edition in the camera. The battery life is really good. When I travel I can go all day long taking pictures and the battery rests all day long. I charge it for a few hours and that's enough to fully charge the battery. That's really cool!Now, in a negative side, the Zoom is not good for the video. In fact you better not use zoom at all because the video looses quality and becomes blurry and the image hard to distinguish. The zoom for photography works really good. Is just not good for shooting video. I think Olympus need to address that issue when they create new models.Other than that I believe this little camera is really good and offers a lot for it's price.", "Date": "November 28, 2012"}, {"Title": "A+++++ camera", "Author": "moe", "ReviewID": "R1APLB49CWPOXP", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "the olympuz SZ-20 is the best point and shoot that i ever got and the 3D pictures is one of a kind", "Date": "September 26, 2012"}, {"Title": "Great camera", "Author": "tbrot", "ReviewID": "RMJ7IOISG29BT", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Needed an updated camera instead of my IPhone for a trip from Tahoe to Yosimite.

Warner", "ReviewID": "R2Z7E9GN7ABFQV", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "this camera took very good pictures... I say TOOK because it only lasted a little more than a year and in that time was back to olympus for a zoom error.  The reason it died is completely my fault.  I dropped it in the sand.  BUT this lens is flimsy and prone to getting stuff stuck in it which will kill it.  Beyond that, if you take better care of you stuff than I do, this camera take very good pics and is easy to use.", "Date": "December 31, 2013"}, {"Title": "Good movie mode / average photo quality.", "Author": "John \"JJohn\"", "ReviewID": "R1RVX0Z4TVL7LT", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "I mainly purchased it for the movie mode and zoom capability and would say it's performed fine there. Even in the lower 720p resolution you will get good quality for this price point but it does have a higher 1080 setting. You can zoom in and out during filming with minimal motor noise. The 3 inch LCD display is bright and clear unless your holding it at a steep angle. I have not yet filmed in low light conditions. Sound quality is good. As for photo image quality and color reproduction I used a much older Canon A510 for comparison. I was a little disappointed to find that my Canon captures pics with better color accuracy. No issues with the SZ-20's movie mode, it records with accurate color. The SZ-20 takes pics with better detail but only at it's highest setting (16MP), not impressive considering my Canon is just 3.2 MP. To be fair the A510 was a top rated camera for it's day.The SZ-20 has a manual pop up flash which I prefer. Also, high capacity generic batteries are available for less than $10. Since I got a good deal on this (rebate) and purchased it mainly for it's video capability I'm pretty satisfied but if top quality pics is what your after there are better choices.", "Date": "July 24, 2013"}, {"Title": "Lovi It!", "Author": "S.
