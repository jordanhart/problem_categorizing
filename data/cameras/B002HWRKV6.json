{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Mixed bag of tricks", "Author": "slkx", "ReviewID": "R3O03MXC98SGU0", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "First - an aside: If you're getting the Olympus FE-5020 this is the colour to get - the pearl white look is sublime to look at and touch.This camera has an awesome super wide angle lens (24mm) and excellent macro functionality. It also takes brilliant pics in the self-portrait setting at night with little light, which is an impressive feat. The downside is the colours in normal photography can be a bit washed out. There is no dial on the camera so every changed setting requires entering menus on-screen or tapping buttons repeatedly to make small adjustments. It is designed for the camera novice and as such get used to having decisions made for you on almost every mode. It is very easy to use and is the size of a deck of cards.This is an ideal camera for real estate agents as it can get three walls in the frame of an average room - amazing how it shows the full size of an area, with only the slightest fish-eye distortion on maximum wide-angle. That's pretty impressive. There is no viewfinder but it doesn't matter - the whole back screen is your viewing area.Pros: Size, super extreme wide-angle, macro, 12MP!, light, ease of use, price (exceptionally good given the 24mm lens)Cons: Washed out colours in regular landscape shots (fixable later, but still...), no dials to easily switch settings, no view finder, buttons may be a little too small for people with large fingers, feels a little flimsy.I would recommend this but mainly for people seeking it for the wide-angle or macro purposes. For bold day-to-day holiday snaps where you need vibrancy, try a Canon.", "Date": "April 11, 2010"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": "Unavailable", "Features": "12-megapixel resolution for photo-quality prints up to 20 x 30 inches\n5x wide-angle optical zoom; 2.7-inch LCD\nCapture images to xD-Picture Card or microSD (not included)", "Name": "Olympus FE-5020 12MP Digital Camera with 5x Wide Angle Optical Zoom and 2.7 inch LCD (Pearl White)", "ImgURL": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41bzIlnTbXL._SX300_.jpg", "ProductID": "B002HWRKV6"}}
