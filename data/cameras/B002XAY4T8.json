I'm very impressed with the built-in panoramic feature and optical zoom. I bought it for the toughened case and compact size and got more than I bargained for. It is in like new condition and came with a 90 day manufacture's warranty even thought it is factory reconditioned. The extra battery (it came with one) and 2 gig memory chip will keep me going even on 3-5 day hikes into the back country where I like to go. It's not just waterproof, it has underwater photo capabilities as well. Great buy.", "Date": "July 17, 2012"}, {"Title": "Not as tough as I hoped", "Author": "AEndersGAme", "ReviewID": "R130LLRM5VSL3L", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "This is the camera that is touted as being able to withstand water, dropping, pretty much indestructible for the regular person. I took this camera to the pool and out on the mountain bike trails and it worked great. The image quality isn't that great, but I knew I was sacrificing that in order to have a camera I could take anywhere with little worry. However, the camera did not stand up to the beach. One day on the beach and it started having trouble turning off and on as well as changing settings while on. Ultimately the camera stopped working altogether and I have not even owned it an entire year.", "Date": "July 21, 2011"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": "Unavailable", "Features": "FREEZEPROOF (14 degrees F/-10 degrees C)\nSHOCKPROOF (6.6ft.)\nCRUSHPROOF (220lbf.)", "Name": "Olympus Stylus Tough 8000 12MP 2.7 LCD Digital Camera (Blue)", "ImgURL": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41LtTzPAfpL._SX300_.jpg", "ProductID": "B002XAY4T8"}}
