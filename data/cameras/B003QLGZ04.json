The 201A is only 640x480 resolution, but has pan tilt and zoom (PTZ).  The static image quality of the M1054 is much higher (I'm running mine at 1280x800 pixels). When the Axis is online, its images are very good, certainly better than the 210A - but not $250 better.  I need hi-rez images for security purposes and hoped that the M1054 would out do the 210A.  Both have been in my lab and running for 2 weeks now.  The 210A was easier to set-up and more importantly, it has stayed up the whole 2 weeks.  I've had to re-boot the M1054 dozens of times, re-assign IP addresses, unplug and plug it in again to keep it connected to my monitoring software.  I've even had IT guys in trying to figure out why the M1054 keeps dropping off the internet.  Haven't solved it yet.  For the price, it's server software and ability to remain online (or at least reboot itself when it looses connection with the monitoring host should be far more robust.", "Date": "January 30, 2011"}, {"Title": "Working very well on Mac OS", "Author": "ECDM", "ReviewID": "R2TFZG1MGJML2J", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I am starting to build my surveillance system at home with Axis Cameras (PoE) and SecuritySpy, as controller.

The M1054 is part of the Axis M10 network camera series. There are four cameras in the series and two of the four (including the M1054) are not wireless. The wireless M10 cameras end with a \"W\" in their model name. The difference between the M1054 and the rest of the cameras in that series is that it has the following:- higher resolution 1280x800- min. illumination of 1.2 lux- 1MP 720p- alarm inputs/outputsI am no expert in surveillance and equipment. This is my first camera. I am managing this camera using my Synology DS211+ running the Synology Surveillance Station app. It works great and no problems whatsoever. Setup was easy on both the camera's built-in settings (there's plenty settings to mess around with in terms of video/audio/events/triggers/etc) and under the Synology DiskStation as well. The reason why I decided to go with Axis was compatibility with my Synology DiskStation but most importantly because of the reputation Axis has with its products. Yes, this is an expensive camera but when you compare video quality and the amount of settings you realize the value of it.Running the camera for the first time, you will be instructed to set the password to the camera. This is done by entering the IP address to the camera on your browser. After that, you have access to the setup page. I reserved an IP address to the camera on my router to make things a lot easier. Depending on your network setup, you will need to make sure you allow incoming connections to ports 80, 554 (RSTP to allow H.264 streams).  This is all documented in the manual it comes with. Again, this is my first camera and if you have general network knowledge you should be fine setting it up and making sure the ports are forwarded on your router.It runs smooth. No issues to report so far. I've had it running for about a week now. No disconnects as stated in some of the other reviews here. I have it connected to a DLink 1008P PoE switch and that is hooked up to my Apple Airport Extreme wireless router. The camera is hooked up with a Cat5E 100 ft cord. Again, no issues to report. Works great and wish I could afford to get a second one for more coverage. I may end up doing this later down the road. I'm very happy with this camera.", "Date": "May 6, 2012"}, {"Title": "Great Camera but not WireLess like the title says", "Author": "Mr. G \"Kemit\"", "ReviewID": "R2CEWMA68AUH4", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "The is a great camera, I have it on my front yard, the low lux allows for color display with the street light. However, it was advertised as being wireless, it is not. Thus the reason for a three star.  I think Amazon needs to correct title since it is misleading. Otherwise, excellent small HD camera that does what it says it does. I especially like the C-Clamp attachment. I was able to clamp it to the window sill.", "Date": "March 27, 2012"}, {"Title": "A Fantastic Little HD quality Surveillance Camera", "Author": "Y. Herrera", "ReviewID": "R28LDWHTLY9NC", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "My family owns and operates two Mexican restaurants and I've been tasked with setting up and installing the security cameras for both locations. Early on, I chose Axis cameras for the consistently good reviews they received. And over the years, they rarely disappoint.The M1054 is their HD/720p capable line of small surveillance cameras. I believe this will be our fifth one. Video quality is tough to beat and the frame rate, with a fast enough computer, is anywhere from 20 to 30 fps (frames per second) easy. There is no manual focus ring (mostly a blessing than a curse). The camera is very easy to set up and works great in conjunction with SecuritySpy from BenSoftware for the Mac. The night/low light visibility from this camera is better than any of the other/older Axis cameras in the same range (Axis 206 or 207s for instance).The Power over Ethernet feature, when coupled with an appropriate PoE router, is a life saver. It means one ethernet cable provides both data and power. Incredible useful for difficult locations without close power sources.All in all, highly recommended for those in need of light surveillance, including restaurants or other retail.", "Date": "May 13, 2012"}, {"Title": "Great network camera", "Author": "Cas Walker", "ReviewID": "R2AR1L1TAU2FU7", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "We've been using Axis cams for five years and this is the best one yet. The resolution choices are great and detail in the pictures is outstanding. There are enough customization settings to get a good picture in any light conditions. I really like the power over Ethernet, it makes installation simpler. One issue that surprised me is that our old camera recording software can't deal with the higher resolution pics gracefully. The software's options for motion control are not sensitive enough to give us a good balance between too many pictures saved and not enough. So I'm looking for a new camera recording program.", "Date": "January 25, 2012"}, {"Title": "Worth the price", "Author": "TheDude", "ReviewID": "R2Y55WVWTEXI0V", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This is an expensive camera.  You can find others that are half the cost and have similar specs.But this camera is worth it.  It's far better than cheaper units.  You get a high resolution stream, with a mild fisheye lens which lets one camera, placed in a corner, monitor an entire room with no hidden spots.  In other words, this camera has 90 degrees of coverage, and enough resolution to have clear identifications within that 90 degree radius.It's also small and nice looking.  I'm happy with it.  I will update this review if anything changes as we get more experience with it.I like that it has power over Ethernet.  This means we run one Ethernet cable to it and we're done.  Greatly simplifies wiring, and has the benefit that if your POE switch is on UPS, then your camera is also on UPS.It's made in South Korea.", "Date": "October 2, 2011"}, {"Title": "Excellent camera for the price", "Author": "JC", "ReviewID": "R3EZAPMY0DZ8OI", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "When I buy an Axis product, I expect to pay well for it but I also know I'm going to get what I paid for.  This camera does not disappoint.  I use them both as standalone devices and as parts of larger surveillance systems.
