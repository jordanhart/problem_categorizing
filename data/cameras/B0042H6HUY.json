I use this thing for ALL my macro shots. This tube works great on the nikon d3100. I have been able to get so close with macro shots it's not even funny. Bugs, plants, tiny objects. I would recommend these tubes to anyone, don't waste money on a macro lens. Just get this, and if you want to get in closer maybe get some filters but don't spend more then 25 bucks on them combined! You can take macro shots for less then $25.00. Just attach the extension tubes, then your lens, then whatever filters you desire. You are going to have to manually focus everything and expose on your own. Putting the extension tubes on takes away any auto focus you have (that's cheating anyways, do it yourself.)", "Date": "October 24, 2011"}, {"Title": "Wobbly and loose", "Author": "Eileen Sandell", "ReviewID": "R34EU47NGXHXZ3", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "It looks nice enough but it is so wobbly when attached to my lens and camera. It is very loose and I can't seem to make it work right. Yes. I know how to work the settings etc. I'm glad I didnt pay any more $ for this.
