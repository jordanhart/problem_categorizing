I shoot professionally and personally, and I love this camera.  I will say that the shutter lag while in live view mode was a little disappointing, but IMO didn't warrant dropping a star :o)The company that sold this described it as a 4 lens kit, which was just a LIE.  In actuality it came with ONE actual {kit} lens, and 2 lens converters {macro & telephoto}  and a set of filters.  I contacted the company to inquire where my \"fourth lens\" was, but all I got from them was the run around and 'please call this long distance number and hold'  They refused to answer my questions via email, and said that someone would call me, but they never did.  The seller gets only 1 star from me {for promptness}.  I don't like being deceived and ignored.But the camera rocks!  The kit lens is \"ehh\" but put a 50mm on this bad boy and you get \"WoW\"", "Date": "May 24, 2012"}, {"Title": "Exellent camera", "Author": "BEAU", "ReviewID": "R23CBE1RP510O", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Great camera. I am a begginer in this field but I like it. 4 Star because the kit is useless and the battery does not last very long.
