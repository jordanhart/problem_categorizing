Digital cameras including this one with LCD monitor screens put savage power demands on their batteries. The basic chemistry and construction of alkaline batteries means that they are not able to efficiently deliver power at this very high rate. They just get hot and their voltage drops very quickly, making the camera shut down in a matter of minutes.Olympus have been amazingly short-sighted in supplying a pair of alkaline batteries with the D-560. It's giving users the very mistaken idea that it's designed to use this battery type, when it *isn't*. The manual on the CD-ROM more or less spells it out that alkaline batteries are only to be used as a last resort. OK?Rechargeable Ni-MH and non-rechargeable lithium batteries (CR-V3) have a completely different chemistry. They *are* capable of efficiently delivering the kind of power this camera (and other digital ones) demand, to give a very useful operating time.I've been using 2,000mAH PowerBase Ni-MH batteries in mine, and getting more than 150 photos before one set is discharged. I think that this is perfectly reasonable. The supplied 16MB XD card can only hold about 80 1024x768 pictures after all.The bottom line is this: if you are going to buy this or a similar digital camera, be prepared to buy some Ni-MH batteries and a charger or pay a lot for CR-V3 lithium batteries for as long as you own it. Olympus should make this fact crystal clear in their owner's manual, but they don't.Yes, the D-560 obviously does have a design fault. It will often give the Low Battery warning even on batteries which have just been charged. However mine doesn't stop working, and the flashing red symbol disappears after a while. If you can live with this glitch and are prepared to buy Ni-MH batteries and a charger (or CR-V3 batteries), this is one incredibly good digital camera I fully recommend.", "Date": "August 5, 2003"}, {"Title": "The best digital camera I've ever used.", "Author": "R. Kent Bailey", "ReviewID": "RN5S4301W67PY", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I've been using this camera to send digital photos to my freinds and relatives since April of 2003.  I love it and would not use anything else.  In my opinion a good digital camera is all about three things: image quality, ease of use, and size.  The Olympus D-560 scores big in all three areas.The image quality is great.  This particular camera seems to do an exceptional job of adjusting to whatever lighting conditions I'm shooting in.  I often compare photos I've taken with those taken by freinds or relatives using other digital cameras during vacations or special events and mine come out better.  The camera is insanely easy to use.  Just point and shoot, no need to select modes or make any adjustments, it makes most of the adjustments for you.  However, if you want more control the camera does allow you to fiddle around with various specialized modes.  So far I have found such modes unnecessary.The physical size of the camera unit itself is just about perfect for me.  Slightly larger than the palm of my hand, it's small enough to tuck into a pocket or bag with ease, but it's not so small as to make it awkward to hold and aim.After using this camera for 8 months I have discovered some drawbacks.  First, my camera did NOT operate well on standard AA alkaline batteries.  It was constantly locking up, beeping, and generally malfunctioning.  I thought I would have to replace the camera.  Then, on a tip from a freind, I switched to the higher powered CRV-3 Lithium battery, (available on Amazon) and my camera woes were solved.  It's worked like a dream ever since.  Second, turning off the camera is kind of clunky and time consuming.  You turn the camera on and off by sliding the front lense cover open or shut.  This is nice and simple, but closing the camera takes some time, as you have to start to close the cover, then wait for the lense to retract back into the case before you can finish sliding the cover shut.  This adds an extra 5 seconds to the end of any photo session before you can stick it in your pocket and move on.  To some this may be annoying, but I've gotten used to it.  And lastly, of course, the 16mb memory card that comes with it is too small to be very useful.  (I remember only getting around 17 high quality pictures on a card.)  Invest some money into a high capacity memory card (128 or 256 MB) and you can take hundreds of shots without having to download them or switch cards.So, in summary, great camera.  For better results use a CRV-3 Lithium battery instead of alkaline, and get a big memory card.", "Date": "December 27, 2003"}, {"Title": "There are better choices..But great shots for a cheap price!", "Author": "Roy Chan", "ReviewID": "R1LQ3KTN5ZY38L", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Pros: Great software, panaromia mode, nice clear lcd, and quick download of pics to pc. Cons: Some blurryness if you take pictures in motion, Battery life, and the way the lens expands. This camera was easy to use. Tested this camera side by side with other cameras in the same price range and this one took better pictures. The included software is really easy to use. The camera has two issues. The first downfall with this camera is the batteries. BE SURE TO CARRY AN EXTRA SET OF BATTERIES AT ALL TIMES. We were changing batteries about every 40 pictures or so....which is very easy to do in a short amount of time with the \"rapid fire' mode. The other downfall of this product is the media card. The media card is not compatable with our printer's (HP 2210) smart card reader ports.

Not in televisions and discmans.The second advice is that a company that has a reputation for professional equipment does not necessarily make equally good consumer level products. I make this comment after my experience with Nikon.Now for the D-560 - Firstly - this talk about low battery life on this camera is nonsense. You HAVE to use NiMh batteries - Olympus should have made this amply clear. So ignore these ill informed comments about battery life. One can easily take 50 - 60 pics with plenty of flash and LCD use on one pair of rechargeable batteries. Since the camera uses only one pair of batteries, it is easy to carry a spare that is fully charged. Now for the Pros and Cons -Pros -Takes beautiful and sharp pics. Print them 8X10 and you will be left staring at them. Believe me!Its shirt pocket size - depending on the pocket, even two might fit. Very handy and compact. You will carry it with you everywhere and take more pictures that way.Large 1.8 inch LCD display - bright and nice. Almost occupies half the back.Very quiet mechanism. The sliding plastic cover - that also serves as an on off switch - is a very simple and highly effective solution.Lens and CCD combination takes very sharp pictures with very little noise.Color fidelity and balance is top notch.Powerful flash.Contains the basic controls one might want in a P&S.; Including, night mode, macro, potrait, backlight etc..It is possible to use landscape/potrait mode to switch between max aperture and min shutterspeed exposure options. Very handy - can make up for the lack of exposure controls if you want to become creative.Exposure control is accurate. Uses standard batteries - so it is possible to use regular AA ones in an emergency. They work reasonably if you don't use the LCD.Reasonably fast startup and quick shot to shot times because it seem that the XD card has fast write times..Now for the cons -  uses XD cards - and these cost almost twice as much. Add its cost to the price of the camera. Add the cost of a charger and set of batteries as well. (I recommend the panasonic charger+batteries). However, your charger/batteries have other uses as well - like use them in your discman. In many cases you might already have them with you.Movie mode does not capture audio.", "Date": "February 18, 2004"}, {"Title": "Are we talking about the same camera?", "Author": "A Customer", "ReviewID": "R3RHTFJPD6QVKZ", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I've been reading some appalling reviews for the D-560, and I can't sit by without asking if we're talking about the same camera?

If people would take the time to actually read the book instead of putting a pair of alkaline cells into it, pointing it at something, stabbing the shutter button then complaining about the result, they might take decent pictures with it.  This camera is designed for NiMH or CR-V3 batteries (but which are not supplied with it), the book says so. It has auto-focus which takes a moment to lock onto the subject or it will produce blurred pictures. The book explains this. If you move the camera while taking a low-light photo, it will be blurred, as with every camera. Geez!  Very few of the photos I've taken with the D-560 have disappointed me. Many have amazed me and others with their sharpness and rich colour.  I love this camera so much that I've given it a web page to show off what it can do.

Isidro \"hotdealsfreak\"", "ReviewID": "R2EB48HLUDBP2", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "First thing is I want to say was this was supposed to be my first digital camera.  I'm a college guy and I bought this for a cancun trip after seeing great reviews for its predecessor D-550.  But after a week, I got rid of it.  Don't get me wrong, this was a great camera.....but only outdoors in FULL and I mean FULL sunlight.  When it came indoors I was very disappointed.  Yeah I did my research and I know this camera is only 4 second shutter for night mode.  The thing is I took pictures indoors with real bright lights, and 7 out of 10 came out blurry.  Moreover, when I mean blurry, I mean unrecognizable like everything was moving, not noisy where if you zoom in the picture it becomes less sharp.  I tried different modes but almost all came out blurred.  It might be my camera, but why would it take outstanding outdoor pictures yet take blurred out indoor images of still objects with flash???  I thought it was maybe because it needed to be steady, and it got a little better when I placed it on a tripod.  But who would carry a tripod in cancun in the clubs and beach at less than full light?  Maybe someone who wasn't there to have fun, that's who.My opinion is get a Canon A70 for around the same price.  I did, and even though the picture quality wasn't as sharp outdoors as the D-560, the indoor shots far outweigh the outdoor images.", "Date": "May 12, 2003"}, {"Title": "People seem to either love this camera or hate it.", "Author": "Matthew Kirby", "ReviewID": "RK0YSNHRXYP9P", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "First of all, yes it is a glutton for batteries.  I habitually use rechargables anyway and recomend others do the same.  You might also want to get an adapter to run it off house current so you don't run down the batteries while it's hooked up to your PC.As for image clarity, remember that this is a digital camera.  It takes a moment after the button is pushed for the camera to take the picture and it must be held steady until it's finished (the higher the resolution the longer it takes).  This can be difficult especially when trying to use the panorama funtion.  I recomend buying a folding mini tripod to keep it steady.  Also there many presets on the camera that will effect the quality of the picture.  Everthing from flash to exposure time to day or night pictures.  It's a good idea to take a test picture or two to make sure conditions are right.In short, this is not the kind of camera you can whip out at a moments notice and take a quick snapshot with.  If that's what you're looking for them stick to a 35mm.Oh, and it was mentioned in an earlier review that this camera does not save it's settings and funtions such as flash, resolution, and various picture modes must be reset manually each time the camera is turned on.  Not true.  There is a selection in the setup menu which lets you choose wether or not settings will be saved when the camera is off.  Though if it looses power for too long it will return to factory presets.In conclusion, it's a good camera as long as you bear it's limitations in mind while using it.

With NiMH, it will do about 100, but like another reviewer said, it quits long before the battery is discharged.

If you use the zoom at all, then the photos are very dark and unusable.o Once you take a photo (especially with the flash), there is a considerable time before you can take the next one - not as bad as on my FIRST digital camera (also an Olympus), but bad enough so that you miss half of the wedding party when they are walking SLOWLY down the isle.  Also when you want to take that second shot of a group, they get impatient with you as you stand there and keep pushing the button and nothing happens.o The \"macro\" mode still gives blurry pictures sometimes.o The (optional) underwater housing is cute, albet bulky, but the photos you take with it are not clear (because of the bad flash).", "Date": "September 24, 2004"}, {"Title": "Almost bought this, then saw the new model: Olympus D540", "Author": null, "ReviewID": "RT5AICB4NXMKK", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "First of all, please note that the clam-shell design for this camera (D560) is NOT weatherproof - it has no rubberised seals & liners like the Olympus Stylus series (models 300/400/410).  So, if protection against the elements is a must, buy one from the Stylus range instead.This camera is indeed a real battery hog as reported by other users, because last year I was testing my colleague's newly purchased D560 unit (known in Europe/Asia as C-350) when it drained 2 new alkaline batteries empty in less than 40 minutes.  On a trip to cold Korea last year, he had also reported on the need to remove and reinsert his 1800 mAH NiMH rechargeable batteries every now and then in order to continue using them with this camera.Nevertheless, I have seen several hundred photos taken with his Olympus D560 and they were so sharp, colorful and contrasty that I decided to buy this camera as a secondary 'pocketable' unit to my existing Canon Powershot A80, which was too heavy for the purpose.  I had also figured on using higher capacity rechargeable NiMH batteries of 2100 mAH to tame this power-hungry beast.Then the new Olympus D540 model (known in Europe/Asia as Olympus C-310) arrived, together with a multitude of improved features such as:1) 2 macro modes for close-up shots: 20cm 'Macro Mode' and the new 2cm *'Super Macro Mode'.  The latter enables you to take fantastic close-up photos from as near as 0.8 inch (2cm) away & above.  In contrast, the D560 only has the 20cm 'Macro Mode' and at a best close-up distance of 8 inches away, is way inferior to competing Canons and Nikons that can go as near as 2 inches (4-5cm);  2) extended shutter speed range of 1 second to 1/2000 seconds, compared to the D560's 2 seconds to 1/1000 seconds;3) faster lens aperture range of f2.9 to f5.0, compared to f3.1 to f5.2 for the D560;4) option to save pictures in 2.0 Megapixels aside from 3.2 Megapixels and VGA size; the D560 has the less popular option of 1.0 Megapixels in between 3.2 Megapixels and VGA size;5) flash located further away from the lens to reduce red-eye effects compared to that on the D560;6) lighter camera body at 150 grams, compared to 170 grams for the D560, and finally,7) cheaper than the D560! (although this is actually a price savings, and not a real camera feature) *'Super Macro Mode' is really a hidden Ace, as it is hidden away in the menu option & was not much advertised by Olympus (if at all).  You can check it out under Page 61 of the downloadable user manual for D540 at Amazon.com.  As far as I know, no other cameras in this price range (and significantly above) can get you this close: 0.8 inch (2cm).In case you are wondering, I wish to emphasize that the Olympus D540 (3.2 Megapixels) is actually the NEWER camera, and this D560 model is the older one - Olympus seems to have a confusing habit of naming its newer, budget models with decreasing model numbers instead of progressive model numbers like its own higher range.To be fair, the new D540 lacks the following when compared to the D560:1) clam-shell design of the D560; the D540 now uses a sliding power switch (with lock button) at the rear to activate the camera.2) video-out port (for direct playback to TV); it is unlikely that you will miss this, as the built-in 1.8 inch LCD screen is adequate for playback review.  However, if you absolutely require this video-out port, then you must choose the D560 over the D540.3) spot-metering mode; personally I don't miss this at all, since I don't even use it with my Canon A80.  I find the 'digital ESP metering' mode provided good enough for practical use.With the overall improved features built-in and lower price, I bought the D540 of course, and am glad to say that rechargeable battery life (NiMH, 2100mAH) on my D540 is actually ok - no incidents ever of taking 20-40 pictures only as was previously reported for the D560.  Admittedly, the D540 does suffer from a premature low-battery warning indicator - see my Olympus D540 review at Amazon.com dated May 27, 2004 if you are interested.MY ADVICE: Consider the newer Olympus D540 model first, although either one will definitely help you take excellent pictures.", "Date": "June 9, 2004"}, {"Title": "great camera", "Author": "thoang \"tylerhoang\"", "ReviewID": "R37WQFBISVY2DV", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This is a great camera, it takes beautiful pictures.

Use the AE locked when shooting people ( point the camera 4\" at the face of the person the press AE lock move back compose then shoot).

Color is wonderful and clarity is great.  I've never had a fuzzy picture - indoors or out, low light or bright.  Not so with my SLR.  I love the immediate feedback - if you don't like it, retake it.  Of course, that doesn't work well with spontaneous photos of people, but I don't think I have any less success with my digital than I did with my SLR.  At least with the digital I know what I got right away, and can try again.Ease of use:  Accustomed to a bulky SLR, I didn't think I'd like using such a small camera, but once I got used to it, I love it.  The 560 is lightweight and fits easily in a pocket.  I carry it with me everywhere I go.  I couldn't do that with my SLR.  As a result, I take way more pictures than I used to.  I just wish Olympus provided a slipcase with it to protect the LCD screen.  I ended up buying a sunglass case to protect it from things like pens and nail clippers in my purse.I bought the D560 a year ago to replace our broken 35mm point and shoot back up camera.  My main camera was a Minolta SLR.  Since I loved my SLR, I leaned toward buying a Minolta digital, but after some reasearch and a lot of reviews, I decided on the Olympus D-550.  When I went to buy it, I found that I could get it's replacement, the 560 for the same price, so I decided to go for it.  The only time I've been disappointed with the D-560 is when I dropped it and broke the lens... and that was my fault.  As to my SLR, I finished out the roll of film that was on it, and it's been in my closet ever since.  I've been thinking about giving it away because I don't see myself ever using it enough to make it worth keeping.As for my broken D560, Olympus said that the standard charge for repair and servicing is $135.  They will let me know if it is more than that and I can decide whether to have them repair it or not.  I fear it will turn out to be \"not economical to repair\" but I think that if I have to replace it, I'll buy another D560.

Oly has always figured out how to do good things in small spaces, and this camera is no exception. This is my fourth Oly digicam over the years (D-340L, 460, 2020z), purchased for situations where pocketability is important.First, the much discussed battery issue. NEVER use alkalines. They do all kinds of things to a camera that just isn't built for them in terms of voltage. Use NiMH's, standard CR-V3's or the new rechargeable CR-V3's. With NiMH's and occasional use of the flash, LCD in rec mode, I was able to get 200+ photos easily. With a rechargeable CR-V3 (the DigiPower, sold through Amazon), I got over 180 super high res shots before stopping with LCD always on and flash with every shot. Judging by recharge time I think I had at least another 50-60 shots minimum.  Had I gone easier on the flash and LCD I'm guessing that 450 photos would have been a breeze with them. That's a lot of photography.Color rendition and sharpness are excellent, with colors just a little bit 'harder' than on my other Oly's. I noticed that in very high contrast or backlit situations at infinity the camera tended to opt for a smaller aperture (to gain depth of field?), which in a very few situations caused some blurring of high speed objects. That's fixed very easily by using the spot meter or manually opening the lens a bit.Otherwise, this camera's features are easy to access, the clamshell design is sturdier than it looks and at current prices it's a steal. I'm tempted sorely to leave my heavier 2020z and aux lenses home on my next foreign trip.Here's an update from my original Feb. 20 posting:Just returned from a 12 day trip to the UK. Brought the 560 rather than my larger 2020z and its aux lenses because I was traveling very light -- on and off many trains, hikes to hotels, lots of hoofing around big cities. Took over 600 photos, virtually all in basic point and shoot mode at a mix of resolutions using both spot and standard metering. The good news is that virtually every one of them came out just as I would have wanted, the exceptions being a couple of very high speed trains that would have taxed almost any camera given the angles at which they were shot and light conditions. But most exposures almost perfect, with great sharpness and resolution. My only problem was that when I tested my rechargeable CR-V3s after they sat in my bag for about a week (I had been relying on NiMH's because I brought a charger to charge them for camera, radio, MPs player) both seemed to run down pretty quickly, and, I must say in terms of previous experience, mysteriously. Using NiMH's with lcd on for composition and review over extensive periods I was able to get in 50-60 shots easily. Oddly, since coming home I have used the R-CR-V3s constantly and, oddly, I've had one in the camera working perfectly for over a week -- 70-80 photos with lcd, several downloads to computer.This camera has passed my 'usability' and 'quality' tests with flying colors. I'll continue testing it with the CR-V3s and repost if I learn anything new.", "Date": "February 20, 2004"}, {"Title": "relatively quick, relatively easy, relatively painless...", "Author": "Sarah Niblack", "ReviewID": "R1XOC0QJOX5THN", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I really enjoy having this camera. As a music student, I'm busy, I don't have time to fuss with a camera, and this one has continued to hold up to my mild abuse. It's sturdy, compact, durable, and lives in my backpack all the time, unharmed.For a point-and-shoot camera, it produces many high-quality pictures (all of the example photos are ones I took), and the camera is really easy to learn to use. I have been really pleased with it, and from what I've seen, this camera stands up to entry level professional SLR's. I purchased a 128 card, and can get ~190 top resolution pictures out of it. The camera easily adjusts to the situation, regardless of light levels or lighting fixtures, especially if the flash is turned off. One drawback in my mind is that the camera is always on auto flash, and as I use the camera at night, I don't like to have to turn the flash off every time I turn the camera on.About the batteries: I generally use alkaline. I generally use the viewfinder and not the lcd screen, as one can always check the picture right after it's taken (each picture displays on the screen regardless...). It's also very easy to access the view-only mode, which can be on for extended periods of time even when the camera itself doesn't have enough juice. In continuous use, a set of alkaline batteries generally last 2-2.5 hours. Also...if it dies, you can turn the camera off, wait about 30 seconds, and it'll be fine for another 5-10 pictures. (This method can be repeated about 40 times before it really dies.)The movie mode is nice, quick, and doesn't take up too much space. Depending on battery life, you can record up to 30 secs, but my camera generally averages about 15. Also, the digital zoom function is nice, but I've found that it takes time to get to, and I don't really use it anyway.When I first got the camera, I dropped it and had to send it in to be fixed. The service was very prompt, free, and the Olympus people have been VERY helpful and easy to work with. The software that comes with the camera \"Camedia Master\" is easy to install and very easy to use. It has all of the editing tools that the average person needs (\"instant fix\", crop, contrast, colour balance, brightness, lightness, saturation levels, resizing tools, a couple fun effects, etc.), and a very thorough help section.Overall, I have been very impressed with this little camera, and it suits my purposes exactly.

After looking at several types and makers I decided on this camera though with further  reading after I purchased it I was disappointed with the write up regarding the battery situation.  I'm still using the basic AA batteries but plan to look into the recommended batteries in the near future.  Though being able to use standard batteries was one of the reasons I had purchased it only to find out otherwise.  I found having the viewfinder a plus especially with bifocals and I only use the LCD screen when viewing.  The zoom feature on play back is also a plus when viewing photos closer.  It's light weight and so easy to grab and shoot I'm finding I'm taking more photos than I ever did.  Another plus was the ease in downloading onto the computer using the USB cable and the program which was provided with the camera.  It has the capability of printing a thumbnail sheet with the basic size thumbnail photos to one larger photo.

From the start, I was amazed at the incredible detail and picture quality available from a 3.2MP camera.  I'm not a professional photographer, but I've had some education, and I do know perhaps a little more about photography, lighting and composition than most novices.I've owned a Nikon SLR and shot on little else but Kodachrome 64 since the mid 80's.  I'd figured that this digital camera would serve as a backup to my Nikon, and get very little actual use.  In fact, just the opposite has occured.  The Nikon sits in its bag with its array of lenses, flashes and filters, and I reach for the Olympus when I go on vacation or attend a family function.  It's just so easy to use, and while the white balance and exposure may not be perfect all the time, they're very, very close.  I have shot some really incredible photos with this little camera, including some of my younger daughter's wedding which actually turned out better than the hired photog's pictures.My biggest complaint with this camera is its tendency to cause red-eye, which is due to the fact that the flash is so close on axis to the lens.  This is just the way it is in a camera of this size and price, and is not a fault unique to Olympus.I also had some problems getting the camera to power up so that I could download photos from it to my computer when it was new.  Since then, I've discovered that this was a bug related to the firmware in the camera when used with a computer that runs an AMD based chipset, like my Compaq 6430NX Presario.  I solved the problem by buying an externally powered USB hub, and plugging the camera into that.  No more troubles.  I've since learned that Olympus has a firmware upgrade for the camera, but it requires that the camera be returned to them.As another reviewer stated, one needs to understand the workings and limitations of alkaline batteries, and why they're not a good choice for this or any other digital camera.  They're fine for penlights and garage door openers, but not cameras.  I used the set that came with mine only to power up the camera long enough to become familiar with the menus, then I threw them out and bought some NiMH.  In the end, I think the problems that most people have experienced with this camera are due to a lack of understanding of how the camera works, and what its limitations are.Since I've had the camera for almost 3 years, I was thinking of upgrading to a Canon A620, but I still like the picture quality of the D560 so much, that I can't as yet really justify spending $350 or more on a new one that will likely just duplicate what I've already got.", "Date": "February 24, 2006"}, {"Title": "Great pictures, easy to use, awful battery life", "Author": "Dave \"flavordave\"", "ReviewID": "R2HY0UGFG8DEL4", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "This is a neat little camera.

As other previous reviewers have said, it takes great outdoor pictures as long as I choose the right white balance for the lighting. Pictures are sharp and color is saturated. As for the indoor pictures, the objects need to be within the flash range. If they are within 10 ft, the camera takes great pictures. But as soon as the objects are beyond 10 ft or so, the pictures become bad (very blurry and dark).As for the batteries, I experienced no problem as long as I used 2000 MAh NiMH batteries. One thing I did notice was that when I took many shots in short time frame, the low batter warning showed up even though the batteries were relatively fully charged. But instead of replacing the batteries, I let them \"recuperate\" for about 10 seconds. After that, the full battery meter returned and I could take many more pics.It does have a long shutter lag. But if you focus first (let the green light come on) and shoot, you can compensate for it.This camera does not have many features like Canon A70 (such as aperture priority, shutter priority, and video with sound) does.

However, the batteries don't have much life in them after a year and run out of juice pretty fast so I always have to bring lots of spares (think like 3 replacement sets for an event where you take lots of pics).It does take video, but the quality isn't worth it for the 60 seconds you get. There is no sound recorded for the video.The best thing I can say about this camera is that if you know how to use it well, it takes really good quality pictures. Get familiar with the different settings and learn how to control what the camera does, and with that I'd argue it is almost as good as my friend's $300 camera for sheer beauty of pictures.

I got a very good price and for the money this is a very good value.Because of the reviews regarding battery problems, I got her the NiMH rechargeable batteries, with charger, and she has had no problems at all.", "Date": "May 15, 2005"}, {"Title": "Great Camera", "Author": "Shamima Modabber", "ReviewID": "R12J0MTLAJB20R", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I bought this camera for $229, and i think its a really good deal.  i really like this camera because its small, easy to carry around, takes great pictures, and is handy wherever its needed.People give this camera bad reviews for its battery life.  well, this is a digital camera, like most other digital cameras, this of course will eat normal alkaline batteries like pop corn, thats why you spend a little money to buy the lithium crv3 or the Ni-MH batteries.  As for me, i prefer the Ni-MH batteries because not only are they powerful, but also rechargable.  i got 4 batteries, and a charger at radio shack for about 26$ (including tax).so giving this camera bad reviews for batteries is just dumb.  anyway, again, i like this camera a lot, and it takes great high quality pictures, just not always, but even the best of cameras wont always take the best photos in the world all the time.hope you enjoy this camera more than i do.", "Date": "December 16, 2003"}, {"Title": "Olympus D560, start up problems", "Author": "Bob", "ReviewID": "R1DZT1KKGMMV4", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "Pros: Camera is great value and has good quality pictures. The video capability is also really quite good although gimmicky.. Pictures print our really well on my Printer (HP 895cxi) which is an in-expensive good value device. Cons: The software works well once you get it going. I'm using and old Windows 98 version and while the software installed it would not run correctly for a couple of reasons: 1/ The pixel requirements for the software cannot handle the Screen settings being at a low resolution. Without this the system can lock up , the drop down Menu parts of the software also locks up . This is easily fixed if you guess that the software cannot handle this correctly(aka, this needs fixing by Olympus) . Change your setup on windows 98 Goto Settings control-panel Display The settings option for pixels needs to be 1280x1024 . 2/ Must have device(camera) up and powered on initially on the USB port. This may seem obvious , but when you plug the thing on the end of the USB it sits there and the Software just tells you it cannot find the device suggestion to Olympus- Tell folks the obvious, make it user friendly software... Battery Life !!!! is very short , I almost went back to Manufacturer . Maybe there are some helpful tips to save on this while using the camera.", "Date": "July 17, 2003"}, {"Title": "Great Camera, Price is MUCH lower at newegg.com", "Author": null, "ReviewID": "RFE76VZT06QCP", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This is a great Camera.

I put in a brand new 2 AA Energizer batteries, 5 pictures later, it started beeping, indicating low batteries, each shot after that I had to wait till it recovers with full power! 2. Picture Qualities: We took pictures of grassland and buffalos, they all turned out mooshy! You can't tell it's grass other than a big patch of fuzzy green stuff, the buffalos turned out to be a fuzzy dark buffalo shadow! (By the way, I tried all different modes) - What a joke! 3.

True, they didn't pixellate until over 200%, but even at 75% they were just plain not in focus.  Olympus blew it on this one.  Don't buy it, it's a waste of money, even for casual photos.
