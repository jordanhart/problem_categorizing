The camera body is easy to hold and the buttons are laid out user-friendlily.  It's the usual snap-and-go type, and anyone who half a brain can use the basic functions after picking it up.  The memory cards have come down *a lot* in price so there's no reason to whine any more.  BTW, speaking of price, the A210 can be had for under one-fifty if you shop around.  For that price this is simply the best 3MP camera.Image quality is excellent outdoors when light is aplenty.  Night shots do tend to be dark and noisy (noise refers to the coarse-grained color dots you see in a poorly exposed picture).  But after you read the manual you can do things to improve night shots.  Besides, no camera takes great picures when there's insufficient light.", "Date": "November 27, 2003"}, {"Title": "Excellent low end camera!", "Author": "airfirehorse", "ReviewID": "R34ELRZ9JWANRN", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I like this camera because:a) Its batteries last for more than just a few pics (so far the first set has taken more than 15 pics).b) It's comfortable to use (nice size and shape) and nice looking.c) It takes great pics.

I bypassed inexpensive 2MP cameras to make the jump to this, one of the least expensive 3MP ones around that had decent reviews.After using it I can say that it is definitely lacking the sharpness of competitors like the Nikon Coolpix 3100. I only use it at the highest quality level and even closeups for portraits are obviously not razor sharp like I've become accustomed to with the 3MP Nikon and Sony products.On the other hand this camera is at least $50-$70 less than the competitors and when accessories are factored in I was able to get the camera, a 128MB xd card and the handy USB cradle (with rechargeable battery) for $100 less than I could've with Nikon or Sony.The bottom line: this is a decent camera that puts 3MP in reach of the average casual user but it is not very sharp.", "Date": "May 12, 2004"}, {"Title": "Same old stuff", "Author": "superman2k3 \"superman2k3\"", "ReviewID": "R24PEPK1XKVNNJ", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "Fuji 2600 sold very good in 2001 because it was cheap & solid camera (with below average build quality).

Battery life and user interface are also good.Meanwhile cameras from Canon, Sony, Nikon and other companies have improved a lot, added many features and have gotten cheaper.

IT IS VERY USER FRIENDLY! One drawback is indeed the battery life. DO NOT use regular AA batteries. Use the NiMH rechargeables, spend a little extra for the cradle that is like $15, and you will never need to worry about the battery life. They recharge completely from being fully dead in an hour.

I was thinking it must have something wrong with it! When it arrived and I opened it, I was proven wrong! I loved it immediately. I loved the sleek design, and the ease of use. Whats better is that you can choose if you want to take pics in 1mp 2 mp or 3, as to save room on the memory card I guess. I also like that once you take a pic you can edit it right with the camera , right after you take it. You can zoom in with the camera , then crop the picture as well. I figure that the price is one of the best things as well. It is 3mp and you would think it would be at least 200 bucks, but at 140 I think its an unbelivable deal.Now I know nothing is perfect, this is so close, so now your looking for a con, the only one I see is the feel of it, the camera does have a little cheap feel to the plastic.

I knew that my beloved Nikon FM was just too slow to keep up with all the baby pictures I wanted to take. The colors & definition was awesome. But the MP's weren't there for great enlargements. So when my husband suggested I upgrade & he use my 2400 I went for it. I liked the Fujifilm enough to go with another one. I got the A210 and was disappointed. The colors & definition just aren't there. I've had it over a year & have yet to have a photo that I want to enlarge more than a 5x7. I find myself using the older 2400 when it's nearby. I do still carry the A210 in my purse all the time & use it very often. But I keep window-shopping for an upgrade. Another Fujifilm?? I'm not sure.

For a few dollars more I could have found a digital camera I would enjoy much more.  What I can say in favor of this camera is it works and could be a good starter for a child or teenager.  Here's why I strongly recommend NOT choosing this camera:*It's bulky.  Don't bother trying to fit it in your pocket.*It's poorly contructed.  The plastic exterior scratches easily and the coating rubs off after only a few months of use.*Not user friendly.  It's difficult to change options and preferences.  Preferences (such as date and time) have to be programed frequently.  You cannot take pictures without doing this (each time you turn on the camera).*Poor flash.  The flash is too bright and makes everyone look really pale and washed out- Photoshop can do little to correct this.  Removing the flash usually means total blur and/or darkness.*Unreasonably long delay.

I have found that 256MB is plenty.It does take a while to store pictures and calculate focus and exposure, so I have lost oportunities for good shots because of this, but I have still captured crisp, colorful images.I recommend you always carry spare batteries, but at least AA batteries are cheap and can be found anywhere.My A210 has survived trips from the boundary waters (MN) to the summit of Mt. Fuji (Japan).All that said, today (March 2007) you can find many better cameras for about $100. I just placed an order for a Fujifilm V10 for $125. It promises to provide better performance in a pocket size package.If you don't mind carrying a bigger camera, my choice would be a Canon Rebel XP.

It's a very easy to use \"snapshot camera\" because theres not a whole lot of settings to change yet you still can get quality pictures. With the right lighting and atmosphere you can even create photos that look like they were done by professionals. Time and time again people have been amazed that my photos were taken with such a simple camera. I will try to submit some of my photos on amazon.I also have dropped this camera at least 5 or 6 times and it still continued to work. One time i dropped it and the lens would not retract but this was only because the lens became unaligned. After popping it straight it worked perfectly. Only when the wind took it and caused it to hit some blacktop did i finally have to have the LCD screen replaced because it cracked.The video quality is at a small resolution but i had no issues with that, only disappointed because there was no sound on it. I did have some issues with the exposure time because you cannot control it. You can only get long exposure on night shots and even then its only about 3 seconds of exposure. Would have been nice to have more control over that but as i said not expected with a snapshot type camera.Overall i was really impressed with Fujifilm and would recommend a camera like this for those who take a lot of snapshots. As for those getting into photography, its a nice starter camera but it needs an upgrade to open up how creative you can get with it.
