This housing is very rugged and I love that the cable goes inside the mount so it is not exposed. These seals up tight and is the lens is very clear. The camera I have has IR or night vision which would reflect in the glass but I simply put electrical tape over the LED's and it is perfect. If later on I need night vision I will just buy an external IR stimulator.", "Date": "September 24, 2013"}, {"Title": "Excellent housing enclosure", "Author": "Stefano", "ReviewID": "R3SN8O62PEAI42", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "It arrived so fast.
