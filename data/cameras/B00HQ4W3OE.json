I can barely turn on the TV anymore.  So please, read the specs on this because I can't explain what they mean anyway.  This review is based solely on my experience with the camera.We took this great little camera on a trip to Mexico not long ago and it was awesome.  So easy to use that even I managed to get some spectacular photos.  My eyes are over 40 years old (the rest of me feels 29) so I have some trouble seeing up close.  Therefore, the pictures I took with this camera were kind of just point, shoot and pray.  Well the prayers were answered because when we looked at the pictures later on a screen I could actually see, they turned out super crisp.  In fact there was a topless sunbather in one that I hadn't seen and my son was delighted that I got such a sharp, focused shot!  Ha.The HD video is also super cool.  My son is using it to launch his youtube career -- he really needs to focus on college. -- lousy content aside, the videos turn out great.  I haven't used it for video, but he does and loves it.This camera is really sturdy and well made.  It bounced around in my bag, got knocked off the table a time or two, and overall wasn't treated as well as it should have been.  It didn't miss a beat or even get a scratch.The zoom is amazing.  The display is great (or so I am told since I can't really see it).  This is an all around great addition to the amateur photographer or as a basic family camera.  Highly recommend!", "Date": "February 17, 2014"}, {"Title": "Nikon L830 Great Camera....No Zoom Noise whilre Recording Video, Fantastic Purchase...Better on sale......", "Author": "Kimberly Perry", "ReviewID": "R2K404VPQDTS59", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Nikon L830 DOES NOT HAVE ANY ZOOM NOISE WHILE FILMING A VIDEO. It's easy to use in auto mode or has plenty of settings for the novis/hobbist that doesn't want to invest a couple of grand in lense's and bodies.  My fujifilm S8200 had terrible zoom noise. That's why I took it back!This camera has far superior clarity in still pictures compared to the Fujifilm S8200 and when filming in HD, this camera has no interlacing issues when moving the camera like the Fujifilm S8200. I like the ability of just buying AA batteries and not being tied down to a lithium battery pack. I like the RED body although it shows fingerprints more than a black camera....no biggies! I've never used a View FInder so I don't miss that.  I am on the fence about the settings buttons and not having a rotating selector switch.  I do like having the saturation button at my fintertips though so maybe i'm really not on the fence.I do have only 1 issue.  On my old Fujifilm S700, the flash auto popped up when needed. The L830 has to be manually released to function, but knowing that.....I just release it most of the time.MSRP was $299, Sale was $269 and Got it from Walmart for $229, I think she quoted me the wrong price over the phone and had to get a manager override to give me the quoted $229.I'm using a 32Gig Class 10 SanDisk HC Ultra Memory card from Best Buy for $24 and it will allow me to take over 3000 photos.  I think I should have went with a 8Gig SanDisk Ultra PLUS  that had a faster transfer rate.  I think I'd do more research on the SDHC Cards before I buy one.", "Date": "March 8, 2014"}, {"Title": "Very Amateur Photographer", "Author": "Bohemian Girl", "ReviewID": "R1I9V6Z744SIKH", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "My husband and I travel quite a bit. I wanted a camera I could be comfortable with, not spend too much time setting up my shots, and still get a great picture in the end.My last camera was a Canon power shot. After my grand daughter dropped and broke the lens and telescope, I put it away and just used my phone for the past year. We leave for my nieces wedding in Ireland in August. I want to make sure I get tons of great pictures. I want to take classes and become a better photographer. So based on the previous reviewers who give their pros and cons, thank you so much.I like the weight and feel of my camera. I like the ease of selecting the shooting mode, switching between the various menus, and the playback mode is similar to my old Canon. I also like the lens cover. It is like a little magnet gadget and has a tiny cord that holds the cap while it is off the lens. I lost so many lens caps in the past:{One tiny thing I am not crazy about: having to pop up the flash. I rather liked the old lazy way of the auto flash happening when I needed it.I am going to work on my picture taking skills, and report back to you after I know what I'm supposed to do with all these bells a whistles.

People who drive think nothing of motoring over to the nearest photo store to get their camera's specialty brand specific sometimes even model specific battery.  Being disabled I can not drive, trust me I tried driving and lets say everyone in Maryland breathed a sigh of relief when I renewed my MTA Maryland Disability Transportation Card.  You see I never want to be caught without batteriesif ever I am in the right place at the right time with my camera at the ready.  Being disabled I do not have the luxury of being able to pop round the the Ye Olde Photo Shoppe for a bracing battery refill.However I did not want just any camera that used AA Battery power.  I wanted a camera that took awesome pictures and this new Nikon Coolpix L830 does that with ease.  This Nikon Coolpix L830 takes four AA batteries so it is a bit of a battery hog but, I feel the batteries last longer.  You would think the batteries weigh the camera down but nope, this camera is small and light.  Other reviews suggest thie Nikon Coolpix L830 suffers in build quality well that bug must have been fixed.  There was NOTHING at all the least bit loose on my new Nikon Coolpix L830.  I got the red camera and I saw finger prints mine of course, but that does not bother me.  Opening the battery door is a real beast until you get the hang of it.  A better battery door solution is definitely needed for this camera period, I'd take off half a star on my rating if I could.I am just learning how to master the Fstops and understand ISO and how it can be manipulated to improve picture quality.  For the longest time I just set the camera at auto and hoped for the best. This Nikon Coolpix L830 and a new Canon I got were so simple and easy to understand it was almost as if the controls invited me to experiment.  This Nikon Coolpix L830 is so small that my small hands and long cerebral palsied fingers can dance around the camera controls with relative ease.  Once I saw how changing a few of the settings in manual mode resulted in much better pictures than one dare hope for in auto mode I was hooked, like a kid in a candy store,I live in a huge somewhat beautiful building that simply begs to have its picture taken and this weekend I did.  Towson, Maryland is home to some of the most unique buildings some consider perfectly ugly.  This weekend I pictures of my my neighborhood showcasing the best and worse of the Towson, Maryland skyline.  I was not sure I was going to stay out and take lots of pictures so I had only the batteries in my Nikon Coolpix L830.  I took well over 400 pictures with 4 Duracell copper top batteries very few with flash since the sun was  My 6 foot 8 in 300 pound brother goes with me when I take pictures outside, he makes sure no one bothers me.  My brother also blocks out the sun when I want a shot of something small in the shade.  The camera has some noise in low light but the camera can be adjusted to eliminate much of the noise.The Nikon Coolpix L830 zoom is awesome BUT I would use it only with a very stable tripod.  Let's face it the natural shaking of my cerebral palsy does not bode well for any pictures I take using the zoom feature unassisted by a tripod.  The pop up flash is good for objects close by and for general utility pictures but if you want to set a mood or construct a visual experience you will need dedicated lighting.  Remember to pop up your flash the camera seems to compensate better for issues in a shot when you remember to pop up the flash.  The Nikon Coolpix L830 is no where near as noisey as my Pentax K5 or K30 even if they take batter pictures.  The Nikon Coolpix L830 does not exactly slip into a shirt pocket but it can be completely concealed in one of my big brothers massive hands. I wouldnot suggest the Nikon Coolpix L830 for guys with massive or even large hands since everything is tightly packed onto the camera.  My brother can use my Nikon Coolpix L830 and even likes it but he struggles like a gaint trying to change the a new borns diaper.I am NOT a professional protographer.  I am not even an avid photo-bug.  I am just a disabled dude who is fascinated with the art of taking pictures that appeal to me.  I love this Nikon Coolpix L830 because; the more I learn about it the more it becomes an extention of my imagineation.  I am just a beginner in the world of photographn but this Nikon Coolpix L830 makes me feel like a photographer with ideas far beyond my novice station.", "Date": "April 6, 2014"}, {"Title": "Killer Camera with Amazing Battery Life", "Author": "Milamber \"Milamber\"", "ReviewID": "R3NVAHFMKRFS80", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I can't say enough about this camera.

I was absolutely bowled over by the quality of the photographs.  They are crisp and clear, and the color is beautiful.  The zoom is fabulous, and most of the time, I didn't have problems with blurry zoomed photos.  Even in low light, I never had to use a flash.  In Arizona, I took lots of photos at an outdoor Chihuly exhibit in the Arizona Botanical Garden, both in the afternoon and early evening light.  It was fun experimenting with the different scene modes at dusk.  Also took lots of night shots in France, and they were also great.  Some have complained of battery life, but I found them to last a really long time.  I never changed batteries for the whole week in Arizona, and then added another couple of days of battery life in France, and those were with the batteries that came with the camera.  I had purchased rechargeables, and they lasted the rest of the two weeks in France, with power to spare.My reservations-  Hate not having a viewfinder.  If the photos weren't so great, I would have seriously thought about returning it.  Seriously Nikon?  Put a viewfinder in this camera and it would get 10 stars.Also, the door for the batteries and SD card feels a little flimsy.  Opening it is not too difficult, but the closing mechanism is a little awkward.", "Date": "May 29, 2014"}, {"Title": "A great little camera, but I returned for a Panasonic w/ viewfinder.", "Author": "Gramma Denise", "ReviewID": "R25E341227IC7E", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "I loved the size, and feel of this Nikon. The zoom was great, the pictures sharp and the price, very good.  And, I liked the Nikon's tilted screen.  However, this was my first camera without a viewfinder, and after two weeks, I returned it and ordered the Panasonic Lumix FZ60 - a more expensive camera; but, with viewfinder. I really prefer having the  option of having both. The majority of my pictures are nature - birds, flowers, scenery. I had issues with seeing the screen in bright light and it's easier for me the zero in on the subject faster with the viewfinder. It is also easier for me to hold my camera steady when using the viewfinder.  The panasonic does not have as long a zoom, but it serves my purpose and cropping  the final picture brings my subjects in beautifully. The Panasonic pictures are awesome, it's easy to use and has some great editing features. Bottom line, manufactures are missing the boat by not having more options with optic viewfinders  in their comoact models.", "Date": "May 25, 2014"}, {"Title": "Attention to detail lacking ..", "Author": "Vikram Chhabra", "ReviewID": "R20KAMN5JQYLXL", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "First off, I am very happy with my purchase.I was looking for an easy/solid point and shoot, and the L830 came through.With a 2 year old, I want to capture as much as possible without having to worry about bulk and lenses.

It has a very fast auto-focus!  Way faster than either of my Panasonic Lumix cameras.  I thought I might miss a digital viewfinder but discovered that, with the brightness turned up on the LCD, the viewfinder was quite useable in bright sunlight and the view is stunning in hi resolution.  The dual controls for the telephoto are nicely placed and quite accessible.  I also find using AA batteries easier and less expensive than proprietary batteries.

First of all, throw out the batteries that come with the camera.  Mine died after only 2 days.  I brought replacement batteries and they got me by for another week, and then those died too.  My Canon has spoiled me because that battery lasts forever.  It would be nice if the camera had a good battery that was rechargeable.Secondly, I had a hard time easily finding some of the settings that I desired.  It felt a little like finding the needle in the haystack.  I should have practiced more before leaving home.Thirdly, I didn't like the grip on the camera.  I was forever hitting the playback button with my thumb, because that is the natural way to grip this camera.  There is a small pad for your thumb, but its placement just felt unnatural.I also had a hard time getting the flash to work to fill in backlighting, etc.  Also, you need  a VERY steady hand when shooting.Now that I am home, the photo quality seems to be pretty good - at least much better than anything you can get with the cell phone.
