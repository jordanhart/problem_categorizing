Ward", "ReviewID": "R1LYCSHLBXWFVW", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "\"Rollbar Mount can pivot more than 180 degrees and rotate 360 degrees\"Yeah, right.  It does pivot, but if you think you will get the full 180 degrees of motion with the camera actually attached you've got another thing coming.  And as for rotating 360 degrees....that is pure NONSENSE.  It does not rotate at ALL once it is mounted in place.  Sure, you can spin the whole thing around the bar, but if your roll bar is facing at any angle other than where you want the camera to face you're S.O.L.  I ordered this to mount the camera on the roll bar of my Wildcat.  There is absolutely no way I can possibly mount this where I wanted and end up with the camera facing anywhere near where I wanted it to face.  For over $30 I expect to be able to actually AIM the camera once the thing is mounted.  Eventually someone is bound to come up with a RAM mount that utilizes the snap locking ring for the Drift camera.  I think I'll wait until then.  This thing is USELESS.", "Date": "January 27, 2014"}, {"Title": "perfect", "Author": "Francisco Sengia, Jr.", "ReviewID": "RLN0OCMFCJUBW", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I really love this product makes attachment of my Drift camera even better and more choice of locations in my bike. before i purchased this item my only option was the handle bar but now i can attach my camera in other locations...can get better views now.", "Date": "August 27, 2013"}, {"Title": "Good for Hang Gliding", "Author": "Mario", "ReviewID": "R2EZC2MUB3ZV7H", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Good sturdy piece of equipment I will  use on my Hang Glider tail bar.
