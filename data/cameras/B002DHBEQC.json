{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Absolute worst piece of junk camera I have ever bought.", "Author": "S.A.", "ReviewID": "R3N5ZKJUFLXXSY", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I bought this camera as a gift for my wife a couple of years ago and it was a complete waste of $88 and it surely is not worth the $35 being asked for at the time this review was written.- The screen is extremely grainy and has a reddish tint to it.- You will need a tripod to take almost any type of picture with this thing as the exposure time is [unusually] extremely long.- The flash is entirely too bright and washes out everyone's face to the point they look like Mimes.- The \"face recognition\" hardly works at all; it will only work under seemingly ridiculous circumstances.I toyed around with all the settings; ISO, White Balance, Saturation, etc.  I also tried the presets and messed around with those a little, too.  Nothing.I have called and emailed Sanyo customer service, and following their troubleshooting instructions, there is technically absolutely nothing wrong with the camera; it operates within its parameters just fine.  Oddly enough though, user reviews I have read about this thing all echo my own, so I'm sure the build quality is highly suspect.Its only redeeming quality is that it takes decent black and white photos, and the only reason for that is because the exposure time is greatly reduced.Purchase this camera at your own risk, I recommend it as Baby's First Camera, though.", "Date": "August 13, 2010"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": null, "Features": null, "Name": null, "ImgURL": null, "ProductID": "B002DHBEQC"}}
