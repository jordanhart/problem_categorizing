I installed a 500 gb hard drive and the unit works like a charm.  The only issue I had is that the quality of the enclosure was not the best but that did not effect the performance of the unit.  On another note, this unit is kind of loud.  You can hear the fan very easily.  Place this unit in a room or cabinet where the noise is not an issue.  Other than that it's fine.", "Date": "February 5, 2008"}, {"Title": "120 frames / second divided by 9 cameras = not live motion", "Author": "HMMWV \"God, Country, Corps\"", "ReviewID": "R1KAVRFEKK5GQB", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "Don't get me wrong - this IS a full featured DVR system - however after you go beyond 4 cameras (4x30 frames/second = 120 frams/sec) it is unable to keep up with the 9 video inputs, so you must loose a camera or slow down the framerate.  In contrast, their 16 camera / 480 frame record & playback systems can handle 30 frames per second, i.e. full motion video on all channels.The manual on the unit does not cover this limitation - you are left to discover it on your own after hooking up 9 cameras and finding that 12 frames per second is about all you can record.  It's jittery compared with full motion video, which is why it's not an ideal solution except if you you only want to run 4 cameras, then it's perfect 30 frames per second.", "Date": "March 26, 2008"}, {"Title": "runs fine", "Author": "Twisted Uterus", "ReviewID": "R3OYTZ88Z9F6SE", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I have a 3 camera, home security setup, and have been up and running for a few days now. menus are extensive, yet easy to understand, and configure. I bought this to replace an old multi time-lapse VCR setup I had, and am very happy with the unit. remote access to it was a simple setup that worked the first time. One unexpected thing I relly like about it is that the remote access software (netclient.exe) is a single executable file... no \"install\" needed. That means I keep the .exe file on a USB flash drive, that I can plug into anyones PC and do a quick check on things at home. I have even done it from an electronics store, that had machines with internet access. pretty cool. And, the software will allow me to download/review any of my recorded history. The unit was built better than I expected for a device made in China. The manual showed menus that were only slightly different than what the unit showed. happy with it so far.April 27 2008 update....unit still runs fine. Have installed 2 500gig drives. Have the same 3 cameras at the highest quality/framerate possible in order to use the full resources of the unit. This allows 11 days recorded timeJune 1st 2008 update...still loving this unit! One strange \"quirk\" that I can't figure out is that when I try to connect to the DVR through the LAN via the \"netclient\" software, I have no problem if I use the DVR's Lan address.. (192.168...etc) however when I try to connect (while on the LAN)using my IP's (external) address, I can connect for up to ten seconds then the feed freezes. And, YES, my port fowarding is working correctly. If I try to connect from a PC outside the lan, it works just great! Multiple PC can be \"attached\" at the same time. I wish I was able to allow more than 4 name/password users. Then I could keep a better log of who is watching.NOTE: passed the ten week point now.. no rebate check yet, email to dpsi still unanswered...Jan 24th, 2009 belated update...I did eventually get my rebate check. I am still very happy with the unit. I can watch my son get on his schoolbus from work, and check on my UPS deliveries. Unit has run w/o any problems since day one.Nov 4, 2009 update...Damn it. The unit finally wet the bed as they say... I can reboot it, and can see my cameras (5 now) and can even log in remotely still w/o a hitch. The only (major) problem is that all of the keys on the control panel don't work.. and am not ale to playback any recorded video. Heck at this point I'm can't even be sure anything is actually recording.. not a happy camper....Jan 23, 2010...as an update to my Novenber review... I shut it off on Nov 4th for a day or two, and when it powered it up again, everything worked fine, and is still working. Am now up to 5 cameras, and am happy with the unit once again.....", "Date": "March 22, 2008"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": "$999.99", "Features": "Record & Display at 120 FPS / 240 FPS\nRemote viewing through IE browser, or client software\nLoop Back Feature on 1 Channel\nSupports up to 4 internal hard drives for longer recording time\nUSB 2.0 Port for CD/DVD Burner or External Hard Drive", "Name": "Q-See QSNDVR9M 9 Channel MPEG-4 Pentaplex Network Digital Video Recorder (No Hard Drive)", "ImgURL": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/31TyHESh5ML._SX300_.jpg", "ProductID": "B000QYD8KE"}}
