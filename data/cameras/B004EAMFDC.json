You cannot take a wire made for 12 volts and multiply it by 4.  There are exceptions, if you are using this to power phone's, the wattage is so low there won't be a large draw.  Keep in mind, I'm not saying this product cannot handle the power, it is whatever precedes this.  Weather it is an adapter or a wire coming from a 12v distribution box.  If it cannot handle the proper amount of current, the wires will melt and possibly cause a fire.  At the end of the day, do the math, amps * voltage = watts.", "Date": "January 1, 2013"}, {"Title": "Great Product For Automoblile Applications", "Author": "nightowl", "ReviewID": "R2Y0PFH6DV4WP", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This item is great for installing automobile security systems with more than one power hook up.
