{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Great little camera", "Author": "Pete Heller \"Cyclo-maniac\"", "ReviewID": "RBWUF9YM2KQ52", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Definitely recommended.  This is my second digital camera.  The first was circa 2003 (i.e., the dark ages) so this is a major advancement in all categories.  The large, bright screen is a joy to use.  It almost eliminates the need for a viewfinder.  It is quick to start up and the controls are clear and simple.  It's fast and easy to switch back and forth from taking pictures to viewing them.  The battery life is outstanding--at least 5 days of active use.  My only beef is the non-standard USB port--I wish they'd used the standard mini-B port.  However this ain't that big a deal since I generally just pop the SD card out to transfer pics to the computer.", "Date": "November 24, 2007"}, {"Title": "Loving this for Everyday use", "Author": "B Kitten", "ReviewID": "RITYN19FNLJRZ", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I saw this camera at CES a few years ago when I was shopping around for a higher resolution pocket camera. (My previous cameras Fuji 2600z 2.1mpxl & Fuji E900 9.0mpxl).It makes the perfect camera for everyday use in a compact size with simple easy to use functions. The screen is large enough my parents can actually use it without squinting. Though they do fumble a big because it is tiny to hold. But because it only has 1 large shiny button up top, even your drunken friends can take quality pictures.This little digcam is quick loading enough for my camera to take pictures that no one thought you would be able to capture(papparatzi-style). I've taken over 76k shots and haven't had any problems with it. Takes great shots in daylight or nighttime w/flash.The best part about this camera is that a normal person probably won't even need another battery. If you do it will only cost $10-20. If you shop around a 2mb SD cards are $10/ea. On a 2mb card you can take ~594 photos.The Good: quick to turn on & take pictures, excellent night/club people shots, super-bright large screen, long battery life, awesome video + sound, easy to use functions, can take pictures less than 2seconds in between(w/flash), edit any part of the video while on the camera, quick loading/saving data, view pictures by date, adorable body color.The Bad: some of the settings are reset when you turn off the camera, has trouble capturing focused shots of racecars in action, indoor shots w/out flash witll produce a super grainy pics, macro focus starts around 4-5\"+, no viewfinder. Keep the image stabilization on or you are going to be in for some trouble.Easy to Use, simple & that takes nice shots... at the right price. The next step up would be a Canon(which produces more balanced skin colors).I have no regrets about this purchase whatsoever as a cute little daily use camera!", "Date": "April 16, 2008"}, {"Title": "Digital Camara", "Author": "A.

Images are very good and video quality is great as well. Very fast start up!!! i love it!however, the Casio SW is not all that good, it is very limited to what you can do unless you buy the upgrade. But there are plenty of picture/video editing freeware out there, so that shouldn't stop buyers.I droped it once and already got a scratch on the frame, the fram seems very easy to damage... so be careful and make sure you have a camera case.", "Date": "January 17, 2008"}, {"Title": "Nice little camera", "Author": "Oklamama", "ReviewID": "R209DP4AI22RC6", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "This is a great camera if you want something tiny (fits in purse and pocket) that takes great pics.  I am still learning to use it - lots of settings.I am a little dissappointed that some of the best shot settings don't seem to take pictures any differently than the regular setting.  For example, I took a pic of my dog in the \"pet\" setting and then the same pic with the regular setting, and there was no difference - still got \"dog eye\".The pics were sharp, camera was easy to figure out right out of the box without the manual (which you have to pull up on disc).  Needs a stronger flash, but still think this is a great camera.", "Date": "January 7, 2008"}, {"Title": "Love it!", "Author": "Amazon Customer", "ReviewID": "R3MSPWJZZBVZS6", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Love the ease of use, though I wish we were back in the days of real, paper manuals.

My Granddaughter picked it out for me and I am very pleased with this camera.  I had resisted the digital \"scene\"--I was happy with my regular \"film\" camera, however, now I am even printing my own pictures and they are turning out beautiful.  I would highly recommend this camera to one and all for its simplicity in operation and excellent quality pictures.", "Date": "September 1, 2008"}, {"Title": "Exilim EX-Z1080", "Author": "A. Twitchell", "ReviewID": "R1EEDCG6DJ6RES", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "The most outstanding features this camera offers are the great image quality and long battery life. Pictures have very little, if any, noise. The quality in low light even is impressive. I took over 200 shots with a flash before the battery died. This is a great little camera that can stack up to similar cameras from more well known companies. For a small camera the buttons are easy to press and it doesn't feel like it's going to break when I use it. Navigating through the menus seem intuitive enough and there are plenty of them. Great buy.", "Date": "August 4, 2008"}, {"Title": "I LOVE this camera!", "Author": "S. Henley", "ReviewID": "RJPRFFNM4MNDC", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I LOVE this camera!!!This was my second camera that I've purchased.  My first one was a cheap one I used for middle school and didn't care much about. Then three years ago, I bought this one and have sworn by it since.This camera is great at shooting action shots, and great outdoors. I use it on pets, and works great when I photograph nature and hang out with my friends. It has SO many modes to choose from like: youtube video, splashing water, autumn leaves, soft flowing water, auction, text, underwater, whiteboard, old photo, and more. The underwater mode really performed well when I went to the Aquarium - took great pics of all the fish.One negative that I do have about the camera, is that it isn't quite as good at shooting in 'underexposed' or darker rooms without natural light.I would highly recommend this camera to anyone.I bought this case:http://www.amazon.com/Delkin-Silicone-Digital-Camera-Cyber-Shot/dp/B000QXNAH6/ref=sr_1_23?ie=UTF8&s;=electronics&qid;=1206045344&sr;=8-23and it works AMAZINGLY.

The only issue I noticed is that without the flash on indoors the pictures can turn out somewhat grainy but I jsut keep my flash on auto so it isn't a problem for us! Would highly recommend to anyone who is looking to buy this product for the same or simlar uses to ours since it is small and light and yet takes excellent quality pictures for the price!", "Date": "September 1, 2008"}, {"Title": "My second Exilim!", "Author": "R. Linson", "ReviewID": "R3LLT4HEV4JGW5", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "When I saw this camera at this price, I had to get it!! I have the 7.2 MP Exilim since Christmas 2006 and love it! Seeing the 10.1 MP for less than I paid for that 7.2 MP was all I needed to make the purchase. The Best Shot feature is my favorite. The picture quality is fantastic. I loved the video feature on the older model, so I am sure this one will be just as good, or better. The newer model is not as long, but slightly wider - will create a bigger bulge in a pocket - but the view screen is about 1/4 inch wider, so that makes up for it. The telephoto button on the new model is a ring around the picture button on the top of the camera where the older model was a two button (W/T) on the back - kind of liked the old way, but not a big deal.Great pictures, low price, 10 MP, great features, easy to use.", "Date": "August 13, 2008"}, {"Title": "Worst Digital Camera Ever", "Author": "Michelle", "ReviewID": "R2L1OFPA0ES5R7", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I have had a few cameras before and I have to say this is the worst one.
