I am an avid amateur photographer with 50+ years of experience with every film and focal plane technology ever created. This camera is my latest \"pocket camera\" to have with me 24/7, it's for those unique unplanned shots that always pop up when you least expect them and when your DSLR is just not an option to lug around with you all day.Some have criticized the change from AA sized batteries to a Canon propriety battery pack. Hogwash. Technology is going to move forward and the use of a battery pack simply does not mean this camera is any less useful. When you travel into the great whatever with an older camera you thought ahead and took extra batteries with you. Now you think ahead and make sure your battery is charged and yes if you will be away from an outlet you take as many extra battery packs as you need. I am guilty of not thinking ahead plenty of times with the AA technology with no means of stopping into a store to buy more, this camera is no different.The feel and user friendliness of this camera is outstanding. The controls are simple, the instructions (PDF on-line only) are clear and easy to follow, and the image quality is great. You are not going to shoot that perfect close-up shot of a running back diving across the goal line with this camera, but for every day snapshots it offers a nice, cost effective solution to carry in your pocket every day.It's not a DLSR. If you want a full featured high performance camera you'll need to spend a lot more money!9/30/2013 addition- the more I use thus camera the more I like it.

It should be stated that I am not an owner of a DSLR or Nikon, although I've used those before so I know how some who may own those and buy a camera like this may be disappointed or find it less than great. I don't really think it's fair to rate this compared to those kinds of cameras so I am comparing it to my previous \"point and shoot\" camera.We had some traveling coming up and wanted a new camera since my current camera looks in really bad quality at night time or dim lighting (like concerts). So I opted for this camera with the Black Friday sale. I've taken multiple shots with this camera and my old one to see what the difference really is and I will say that this camera shoots way better. My old camera in natural light in my home would be dark, this one is naturally very bright. If I took a photo of a carrot peel with my old camera it would just look like some orange thing, whereas with this camera the carrot peel looks way brighter, the image is sharper, you can see the details such as texture or drops of water on the carrot unlike the old camera. I did go outside and try to take photos and while this does shoot better at night than my other camera, there isn't even a night time option so I'm still having that issue of the photo comes out with the bright lights looking hazy, but it's an improvement from the other camera we owned.Overall, if you just need to update your \"point and shoot\" then I recommend this camera. My old camera only had a 10x zoom and it was 8 MP so this was a really nice upgrade. I take photos of animals, food, and landscapes and have been really pleased with the outcome.

I always carry the latest model with me in a video-camera-shoulder-bag (i.e. - \"purse\" for dudes,) everyday, wherever I go. I have owned and used all of them from the SX100 to the SX160. I have long-considered the Canon SX100 line of cameras to be \"The Best 2-AA-Battery All-Purpose Travel and Field Cameras Ever Made.\" I have posted 5-star reviews of both the SX150 and SX160 here on Amazon during the last two years, and I have made it abundantly clear why I feel so strongly favorable of them.Accordingly, I bought a new Canon SX170. I tested it out to compare it. For sentimental reasons, I intend to keep it. But for the most obvious of reasons, which I just indicated in the above statement, I'm not pleased with it. To the contrary, I am deeply saddened about what has now been completely lost to all consumers, worldwide - The day the last full-featured, full-manual-control, compact, 2-AA battery, travel & field camera left on the entire worldwide market - Died.Here is a summary of my comparative conclusions.&&&&&&&&&&&&&SX160 IS vs. the SX170 IS - A CAMERA COMPARISON - THE BOTTOM LINEThe Canon SX160 runs on 2-AA rechargeable batteries.The Canon SX170 runs on a Canon NB-6LH proprietary battery.Other than the battery, the two cameras are virtually identical.I will start with the conclusion first - There is no serious reason even to consider buying the new Canon SX170 instead of the previous model Canon SX160 ... unless you absolutely HATE using 2-AA rechargeable batteries in a camera.Both cameras have exactly the same features, the same functions, and the same specs - except for the batteries. Cosmetically they are virtually identical cameras in almost all respects except for a small change in the shape of the grip on the right side of the SX170 camera. Functionally they both work exactly the same, and they both produce identical quality pictures. No changes were made to either the sensor or to the DIGIC 4 image processor to bring any improvement to the final images produced.The initial Amazon release price of the SX170 is $179. (Sept. 2013)The current Amazon price for the SX160 is $144, about $35 less. (Sept. 2013)Literally, you have to HATE using 2-AA rechargeable batteries in a camera to want to pay $35 more for the same camera with a mini-sized proprietary battery that will only take about half as many shots with each charge, when the quality of the pictures you get will be absolutely identical with both cameras.SPARE BATTERIES.  Amazon is currently selling official Canon brand NB-6LH spare batteries for about $38 apiece. (Remember, people, your camera warranty is now VOID if you use a \"cheap Hong Kong knockoff\" proprietary battery in it. You do so at your own risk.)  A spare pair of top-quality Sanyo brand \"eneloop\" rechargeable AA batteries can be bought on Amazon for about $4, but even \"cheap\" AA batteries won't void your warranty for the SX160.CAVEAT EMPTOR.That is the bottom line.&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&SX160 & SX170 - BACKGROUND INFO & THE \"2-AA\" BATTERY CAMERA.The SX170 is the seventh model of the Canon SX100 line of cameras. This series began with the SX100 in the year 2007.  From the beginning these cameras have always run on 2-AA rechargeable batteries. That has always been their strongest selling point - the fact that they use 2-AA batteries.  If you happened to run out of rechargeable AA batteries, you could always buy spare AA batteries for them to keep taking pictures.That is the main feature which made them ideal travel & field use cameras literally anywhere in the world.The cameras of this SX100 series were all full-featured, with full manual control, and a good megazoom.  They were also very affordable. Spare batteries for them could be purchased easily and economically. So these cameras were also inexpensive to use, too. And if you bought a new camera, you just transferred the rechargeable AA batteries to the new camera. You never had to buy any new (and much more expensive) proprietary batteries each time you bought a new camera. So in the long term, the AA battery cameras were always much less expensive for people to own and operate.The new model SX170 no longer uses AA batteries. Instead it uses a mini-sized NB-6LH proprietary battery. These batteries are not readily available except by mail order unless you happen to live near a very large city. If you are traveling, the situation gets much worse. In many places the NB-6LH batteries will not be locally available at all.  So the usefulness of the SX170 as a travel & field camera worldwide has been negated. If you are stuck in the middle of nowhere with dead batteries, then you are just stuck with no more pictures!During the last couple of years, these Canon SX100 series cameras were the only full-featured, 2-AA battery, travel & field cameras still left on the world market. The SX160 was the last one. Now the consumer can no longer buy a full-featured 2-AA battery camera at ANY price, except for a few leftover models from previous years. And soon enough they will be gone too.Some of you may realize the gravity of this loss, others may not. Most people don't miss things until they suddenly realize they can no longer buy them, because \"they\" don't make them anymore. And that is exactly what has just happened here.  The day the SX170 was introduced was the day the last full-featured, full-manual-control, compact, 2-AA battery, travel & field camera left on the entire worldwide market - Died.&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&ERGONOMICALLY - THE \"NEW\" GRIPThere is a \"not-so-new\" larger grip on the right side of the SX170 camera. Canon claims it has \"introduced\" a design change with a larger grip on the right side of the camera for better one-handed shooting. Ergonomically. This will indeed be a fine feature for many people. I agree. But Canon's P.R. department says this was only made possible by using the new smaller proprietary battery. No. That is not true.The original camera of this line, the SX100, had that same style, larger right hand grip on it, and it used 2-AA batteries. Canon removed that feature from the next model, the SX110, and made the overall camera flatter. Some of us would have preferred that Canon not make that design change, but that was Canon's decision.Now Canon is \"reintroducing\" that larger right hand grip feature with the SX170, but it has nothing to do with having to drop the 2-AA batteries. I measured the two cameras with a set of calipers. The dimensions of the larger grip on the right side are very similar on both cameras - the grip on the original SX100 (using 2-AA batteries) and the grip on the new SX170 (using the new proprietary battery.)  Canon could have \"reintroduced\" this same design change all along on any of the other SX100 series cameras, and still kept the 2-AA batteries in the camera just fine. So the justification Canon is giving for being able to make this design change is completely bogus.&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&RATING THE SX170I'm giving the new Canon SX170 IS a 3-star rating only for sentimental reasons - it's still a Canon.  It is still an excellent camera in many ways. It still has all of the same excellent features. ... But I won't recommend the SX170 to anyone.Since it now runs on a proprietary battery, then it has to be compared to all of the other similar cameras today that run on proprietary batteries. And in that comparison, it does not measure up very well.&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&WHAT THE SX170 IS NOTThe Canon SX170 is not a fast-action camera, and it never will be. It still has all the same problems of the previous models. It has a noticeable shutter lag, a slower focus, a slow image processor, a slow maximum shooting speed of 0.8 fps (less than one picture per second,)  a very slow flash recovery time, it doesn't work very well indoors or in low light, and it does not shoot full 1920x1080 HD video, either, only the older 1280x720 quasi-HD video.The SX170 is not a good camera for taking pictures of fast-moving children or pets, fast-action sports moments, or fast-focus views of flying birds. The SX170 simply won't work for that kind of photography.There are literally dozens of other more modern proprietary battery cameras out there today that can run circles around the slow-performing, antiquated design and performance of the older-design SX170. So if you really want a modern, fast-action camera that works well in low light and that also shoots full 1920x1080 HD video, then why would you even consider buying the SX170?Canon designed the original electronics for the SX100 line of cameras way back in 2007.* These cameras were originally designed as, \"Stand here while I take your picture\" cameras. And basically that is what they still do best. Changing the battery isn't going to change the primary use for which these cameras were originally intended. No more than injecting \"energy steroids\" into an old dog is going to teach it to do new tricks.If you want a modern, fast-action, full-HD video camera, then the SX170 will simply not work for you.*** Actually it was released in 2007. Design precedes release by about 2 to 3 years, so essentially these cameras were designed almost ten years ago. Remember what that world was like? Digital cameras were low quality and high priced. Most people did not have PCs, and fewer still knew how to use Photoshop. Computer hard drives were 30 gigabytes - smaller than a standard 32 GB SDHC camera memory card of today. Photo paper for printers was terrible and would begin to fade out within months, gone altogether in a few years.  .... Most people were using 35 mm film cameras with 36 shots for each roll of film, paying $27 or more at 75 cents per print each time for all the photos, both good and bad. (There was no \"preview\" feature before they were developed and printed. Besides, you could not \"preview\" photos very well by squinting at a tiny, color-reversed film negative.) ... Most people could not AFFORD to take more than a few pictures each month. Taking pictures was expensive! Every single picture had to count, so yes - literally - using a camera back in those days meant, \"Stand here while I take your picture!\" It didn't MATTER if they were slow. Getting your \"36 prints\" back from the developers at Long's Drug Store took two to three days anyway.  That is the world in which the electronic circuitry for these SX100 series cameras was originally designed.** (If you do want that however, which obviously many people do, then for a short list of modern, fast-action, full-HD-video cameras in a similar price range of the SX170, please see my post of suggestions in the Comments Section, page 1. For a comparative list of (almost all) current Canon point-and-shoot and bridge cameras, please see my post in the Comments Section, at the bottom of page 4.)&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&FOR A CLASSIC CAMERA WITH FULL FEATURES, USING \"2-AA\" BATTERIES, CONSIDER THE CANON SX160.If, on the other hand, you do like the classic Canon SX100 series camera line - as I do very much - you have to like it for what it is. It is an older style, classic design, point-and-shoot camera. As such you simply have to accept the fact that it has some very real limitations. And those limitations are not going to be \"fixed\" simply by putting a different battery inside the same camera.It makes no sense to buy a camera first, expecting it to meet your wants and needs, and then end up being disappointed when it doesn't.  It works the other way around. You find the camera that actually does fit your personal wants and needs first, and then you buy that camera for yourself and enjoy it.If you do prefer the convenience of owning a classic design, 2-AA battery, travel & field compact camera, then I suggest you consider buying the Canon SX160, on sale now, while the supplies still last. That is what I chose to do. I bought two more SX160 cameras, and tucked them away safely in a storage box for my future use and enjoyment for the time when my current SX160 either wears out or breaks down. If you are interested in the SX160, please see my own previous Amazon review of it - 5 stars and more, if I could.The Canon SX160 is still my number one favorite camera I have ever owned, and I still plan to keep right on using it for many pleasant years yet to come.Sincerely, and with best wishes to everyone,  John AKA SLOphoto1&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&POST MORTEM - USING  \"AA\"  BATTERIES AS A RELIABLE POWER SOURCE.Energy independence. That is one of the main reasons why some people - like me - have been fighting so hard for so long trying to keep the last remaining full-featured AA cameras on the market -  If you can choose your own AA batteries in a competitive market, then you have total control over your own power source. And there is no future time limit for being able to still use your camera, either. (\"They\" don't make that battery any more.)I still have my original digital camera, an Epson PhotoPC 600, from 1997. It runs on 4-AA batteries. It still works well, and it still takes some interesting pictures.  They are particularly interesting because the pictures have an \"older\" look to them, because of the older camera technology. I don't have to fake this \"older\" look with special effects in a modern camera or with Photoshop manipulation. They genuinely look older because they really are \"older,\" due to the older technology actually producing them inside the original camera right now.Imagine trying to locate a proprietary battery for a fifteen to twenty year old camera? The only reason I can even still use that camera at all is precisely due to the fact that the camera was originally designed to run on 4-AA standardized batteries. The same thing will be true of the SX160 cameras of today. Fifteen or twenty years from now, they will still work just fine, because they were designed to run on AA batteries.AA batteries were standardized way back in 1954. Almost 60 years later, in 2013, they are still the most widely used standardized battery in the world. And especially now that they make rechargeable AA batteries (as in \"green\" - reusable and even \"renewable\" if you use a solar-powered AA battery recharger,) there is virtually no doubt they will still continue to be very popular for at least another 60 years into the future, too. They are and will continue to be a very reliable source of power - for millions of different items. This will still be true long after the proprietary - and non-standardized - batteries of today will only vaguely be remembered as a passing fad (and expensive folly) of the early 21st century.Non-standardized products have no long-term future in an increasingly globalized world.That's my personal opinion about it, but speaking as a retired history teacher I am also asserting that based on actual and repeated long-term historical patterns and precedents.Again, best wishes to everyone - John AKA SLOphoto1&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&UPDATE: A FEW WORDS ABOUT BATTERY USAGE - HOW MANY PICTURES PER CHARGE?I've been asked to comment on battery usage. How many pictures should a person expect to take with each charge? Here is some data on that. This includes an actual field test I did myself of the earlier model SX150.The proprietary battery in the SX170 - the Canon brand NB-6LH - is rated at about a 1060 mAh (milliamp hours) charge. The preferred, high-quality Sanyo brand \"eneloop\" rechargeable AA batteries are rated at about a 2000 mAh change (or about twice as much.) There is no great mystery to it. 2000 mAh of power will take about twice as many pictures as will 1060 mAh of power.The SX160 and SX170 each require about 2.1 to 3.7 volts to operate the cameras. That requires either one NB-6LH proprietary battery (at about 3.7 volts) or two \"eneloop\" AA batteries at 1.5 volts each, (two for a total of about 3.0 volts.) The NB-6LH costs about $38 on Amazon. A pair of \"eneloop\" AA batteries costs about $4. Either system requires less than one cent of electricity to recharge each time. However, the NB-6LH will probably recharge only about 700 times, based on typical lithium-ion battery life spans, which have a pretty high burn out rate, whereas the \"eneloop\" brand AA batteries are advertised as being able to take at least 1500 recharges.I haven't tested the SX160 and SX170 cameras yet for the number of shots they will take per charge in actual field use (where you are actually using the camera under field use conditions,) but I did do just such a test earlier for the SX150, and here are the results. (Reprinted from my earlier review of the SX150.)&&&&&&&&&\"On a recent field trip to the local mountains near Monterey, CA, I set out with a fully-charged pair of eneloop AA batteries in the SX150, and I carried a backup pair of eneloop AAs just in case. I did a full day of shooting with 425 full-sized JPEGs and 8 minutes of HD video, and I used a lot of zoom and frequently turned the camera off and on too. That is a LOT of battery use for one set of AA batteries. The batteries finally ran out early the next day as I was testing some of the features on the camera.\"&&&&&&&&&Based on previous experience, when I actually get around to doing an actual, full-day field test of the SX170, I anticipate the results to be about half the amount of the results I obtained for the SX150 (or would similarly expect with the SX160, since the electronic circuitry is basically unchanged in all these SX100 series cameras.)&&&&&&&& PLEASE NOTE: These cameras all show a \"low battery\" indicator based on a sensor which looks for a voltage drop. In the SX160 and in previous models, these cameras were designed to use regular Alkaline AA batteries which start out at about 1.5 volts (3.0 volts for two of them.)  When they begin to drop too low, the low battery indicator appears on the LCD screen. Rechargeable AA batteries like the Sanyo brand \"eneloop\" type only recharge to about 1.2 or 1.3 volts (or 2.4 to 2.6 volts for two of them.) The internal sensor will \"think\" that they are running \"low\" long before they actually run out, once they begin to drop below the \"warning point\" for the internal sensor in terms of \"low\" voltage. They are not actually anywhere near \"out.\" My advice is just to keep right on using them until the LCD on the camera finally tells you to \"change the batteries,\" as it shuts down on you.I hope that gives everyone a fairly good idea of what to anticipate with both the SX160 and the SX170 cameras in general terms of the number of pictures to expect per charge.Again, best wishes to everyone, John AKA SLOphoto1&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&UPDATE: Sept. 30, 2013 - DESIGN FLAW DISCOVERED IN THE SX170. POTENTIAL DAMAGE TO THE CAMERA.Recently while testing the Canon SX170 camera in the field I discovered a serious design flaw.  This flaw became apparent entirely by accident through normal use of the camera. It seems that the camera suddenly and unexpectedly turns on or off simply while handling it in a routine manner. This is especially true when trying to pull the camera out of a coat pocket, purse or camera carry bag.Apparently in one of the few design changes, Canon has now relocated the On/Off power button almost to the very end of the right-rear-top of the SX170 camera (literally, only about 1/4\" from the right rear corner of the top of the camera.)  This is the side where the new larger right-hand grip is also located. It is the natural hand position to reach into your coat pocket or carry bag and grab the camera by the main grip in order to pull it out.  When you do, if your thumb happens to be on the top of the camera, you can very easily activate the camera and possibly jam or even break the lens-extension mechanism.When the lens pushes out against a resistance (like still being confined partially inside a coat pocket,) then the lens stops and retracts, and there is a series of several quick \"beeps,\" similar to those of the time-delay shutter release.  The more serious aspect of this is that each time this happens it puts stress on the delicate gears inside the lens-extension mechanism.  Eventually this type of stress can cause the lens-extension mechanism to fail, and the camera will no longer work. (You see them on eBay, \"Lens won't extend outward.\")Back in 2008, Canon faced a similar problem - and a number of lawsuits - over this very same problem with one if its \"G\" series cameras. If the extending lens hit an obstacle, the extending lens would sometimes jam and the camera would become altogether inoperable until it was factory repaired. (And the warranty only lasts one year.)The SX160 did not have this design flaw, nor did any of the other previous SX100 series cameras before it.  All six of the previous models of the SX100 series cameras had the On/Off power button located safely inward toward the center of the camera by at least 3/4\" to 7/8\" from the right end of the camera.I've taken a total of 58 shots with the SX170 camera so far, and this \"accident\" has already happened to me three times. This same easy activation has also suddenly turned the camera off twice while I was simply standing there holding it. This design flaw is an accident waiting to happen.I don't know how much of this type of stress the lens-extension mechanism on the SX170 can take. I have never encountered this problem before with any of the other six models of the SX100 series that I have owned and used previously. They all had the On/Off power button located well inward at a safe distance from the right end of the camera.  So I have never previously encountered this sort of \"activation by accident\" with the SX160 or any of the other previous cameras of this line.  But this flaw does have the very real potential to cause serious damage to the camera, and even render it completely inoperable, just by the ease with which the SX170 can be so readily activated just by complete accident.Earlier I said that I would not recommend the SX170 over the SX160 to anyone. Now I must say that I specifically recommend against it.Once again, best wishes to everyone,  John AKA SLOphoto1&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&& FIN.", "Date": "September 7, 2013"}, {"Title": "Not Impressed", "Author": "Elana M.

The 99.00 deal I got was great but honestly the LCD would bother me the entire time so it wasnt worth it.

It is S_L_O_W, a hand even comes up in between shots asking for you to wait. It does have a proprietary battery, which many are upset about... I'm just impatient to wait for recharging. And, it is constantly _not_ finding the objects that I am interested in shooting (faces of my children), and instead chooses random points in the background - which I found interesting considering I had the subjects faces in the center of my screen.  The camera was trying to be too smart, it seemed.I was ready to return within hours of buying it - my husband thought he'd give it a shot... admittedly, he is more of a camera geek than I am.  Within minutes or reassembling it from its store-packaging, he came to tell me to bring it back.So, if slow-paced, outdoor picture taking is your thing; I guess this would be great.

For a long time my husband and I have shared the 130 so I decided to get a second point and shoot so each of us could have one which comes in handy on vacation.  Sometimes the T3i is not the perfect camera to grab and take a photo from the car window, but I think this one will be.  This SX170is is a upgrade from the SX160is.  The 170 uses NB-6L lithium batteries so I am hoping that they will last much longer than the AA batteries we use in the 130.  The camera comes in a box with one battery, a charger and a wrist strap.  This camera comes in red and black.  I ordered the red and it is a deep matte cranberry color.  Very pretty.  It does not have a viewfinder but it does have a 3\" screen.  The buttons are all the same as other Canons and very user friendly.  The body is slightly smaller and much lighter than the 130.  I have small hands and there is a difference in how it feels due to the placemen of the grip on the front, but it is still comfortable enough.  I have shot moving vehicles and birds with it in \"automatic\" mode and they came out super clear and sharp with no hint that the subjects were in motion.  I am very please with those test shots.  This camera takes a moment to find it's focus in low light but has no problem with full light.  The 16X zoom is awesome and a zoom  across the length of two football fields comes in very clear.  It can become noisy when cropped at those zooms but still useable.  While the video is not as superior as the T3i, it works for me and I am very pleased with this purchase.  I also ordered two extra batteries and a car charger for it.

Let me use my usual disclaimer, in the interest of fairness, and admit that many cameras by reputable makers (and there are many) deliver what they promise. It is more about what camera traits you are looking for. So, I would suggest to anyone looking to buy one to google 'camera trait search' and get the lay of the land.The SX170 is a fixed lens camera (point and shoot, some would say), with 16 resolution (megapixels), and a big x16 zoom. The sensor size is 1/2.3 inch CCD-type, which is standard for cameras of its class.If you were to, say, take pictures of friends and family at an outdoor gathering, this camera is what you need. If you get ambitious, there will be stumbling blocks. Here is the camera's trait mix: It does not have a viewfinder, which, again, many in its class don't. The ISO rating, which is the gauge for how well it does in low light, is 1600. That rating is lower than many others, but it is sufficient for most purposes. The video is a Full HD- that is 1980x1080 resolution. The camera gives you the option to control manually both the exposure and the focus. It does not have a hot shoe for an external flash option. That is not unexpected for its size and category. The LCD screen is a 230,000 resolution. The camera does not do RAW processing but you would need only if you did not want to be limited by JPEG type storage. The weight of the camera is 251 grams, which is light for its zoom.The main difference between the SX170 and SX160:1. SX170 has a doable burst rate of 2.8; SX160 has 0.5. That is useful for fast action pictures.2. SX170 is lighter due to mechanical improvements.Overall, nice camera. Having been into photography for a while, I do stress though that you do a camera trait search.

It isn't bad, just takes some getting used to.  The red color is fabulous though.  I can always find it even when I can' remember where I set it down and it just looks so new and smart.  I was looking for an easy set up, click and shoot kind of camera since I want decent pictures but I don't understand all of the features.  This camera is constantly showing me diferent options on the screen and the slightest bump of the dial on the back,  yeah, right where your fingers go when holding with one hand, and it changes the settings.  What a bother!!!  The screen is nice and big and reviewing pictures on it is easy.  The flash is terribly bright though so I am going to have to find someone help me adjust the settings for that.  It is too dark without the flash in my house during the day but the flash has a tendancy to really wash out the people in the pictures.  I know that this is as much operator error as anything.  Be aware, the flash doesn't pop up at all when you need it.  It in fact has to be manualy raised before use and manually lowered.  That was a detail I missed before buying and was a terrible pain when I started using it but I have that down to a habit now and am not bothered a bit.  It makes it easier to get good pictures of my seven month old since the flash doesn't snap open and cause her to look shocked in all of her pictures like my old camera did.

I'm not that into photography or anything, I just want to be able to take nice, clear, crisp images whenever I can and want. After about a week contemplating, I came down to the SX170 and the Nikon L820. A lot of reviews I read deemed the L820 the clear winner, and there were a lot of negative reviews for the SX170 (partially due to the lithium battery). Both of them have super cheap deals going on, but the Nikon L820 was about $70 more, and a bit more advanced, and bigger than I would like my first camera to be. Plus you needed 4 AA batteries to operate it, and I'm a firm believer in Lithium rechargeable batteries. I decided to go with the SX170, and I haven't regretted it since. I got an amazing deal, the camera, plus a free 16 GB for just $99.

The images all seemed to have an over-smoothed, anti-aliased quality coming right off the camera. I tried photographing stationary subjects outdoors, the camera hand-held, in bright early day broad daylight, with Image stablization both activated and then turned off.The results weren't blurry or out of focus. Yet I could tell this camera would apparently never achieve tack sharp focus. The deal-breaker for me was that another very cheap camera that I have at hand -- the Fuji JV100 -- produced sharper/better images of the same photo-op. The Powershot SX170 might well be an adequate camera for the arena of low expectations: for production of icons, thumbnails and small images on the net. But keeping it honest, as an upgrade to a low-end $70 Fuji, this camera fails to measure up.This is not even getting into the battery debate. I am strictly commenting on the quality of images it produces.One thing: Where my latest camera before the SX170 has an image default dpi of 72 (with image widths of 55 inches at 12 mp) when I open pics in Photoshop for post-processing, this camera produces images of 180 dpi at smaller dimensions as a starting point. This difference got me to wondering about how much and what kind of interpolation is taking place with my old camera versus this one.Perhaps the interpolating is where things are being bungled by the camera. Or maybe it is the anti-aliasing filter on the image sensor. All I do know for sure is that I am going to be looking at aspects of new cameras carefully (suspiciously?) that I hadn't considered before -- including, now, any image smoothing (so-called) that a camera may include. At general info sites, this specific information is scant; maybe specialist sites will be able to help.Cannot recommend the Powershot SX170. I had very high hopes for it, but the image quality is just too soft. My experience with this camera makes me wonder if the same could be true of all newer generation Canon 16 and 18 MP cameras within a hundred dollar range of this one. Anyone?If you want to know more about digital camera \"anti-aliasing filters\", look up \"Optical Low-Pass Filter\".

The one I've had for a few years is a Canon Power Shot A570IS. Loved that camera except that the batteries would get eaten up by it. Other than that I loved it, the pictures were clear, it was easy to use and learn. I use my camera in my work/hobby and take several pictures weekly and put them up on my website. I decided maybe the newer model with more pixels might be a better choice and give me better pictures. I bought the camera and ended up returning it to be replaced thinking it was just a defect in that one camera. When I use the auto mode, the flash doesn't like to work if there is a least amount of light in the room and my pictures were all coming out dark. My older model did this sometimes, but not nearly as much as the newer one. So I have the replacement, I THINK it MIGHT be better, but not much. I have to put it in portrait mode for the auto flash to work as needed. That seems to help the problem. But honestly, I would have thought they would improve on the newer camera, with today's technology, I was hoping to be blown away by it. It is a decent camera, I have nothing else to compare it to except my older model. The new model is 16 Mega Pixels. The older was 7.1.

My daughter's graduation is soon and I needed something fast but I didn't want to rush into things so I did a little homework.  What I liked about this was the wifi feature.  My daughter got everything set up for me which didn't take long but the wifi part she was having a little trouble with although she said if she wasn't rushed, she would probably be able to figure it out.  But you know, that's a nice added plus, but since I bought the cord (extra) that hooks to my computer from the camera, it was simple to download them on the computer and make them smaller using my graphics program to put the pictures up on Facebook.  My son seems to think there's a setting on there to downsize the pictures and I'm sure there is but I was just so excited to get it, that part didn't even matter to me at the time.

You can easily hold it with one hand as it is very light.It comes with quite a nice sensor considering the size of the camera. I tested taking some pictures at night and of fireworks and they look pretty amazing.The camera offers all the quirks to learn how to handle more powerful and professional cameras. While you can use the automatic and preconfigured settings that are normal on compact cameras (like portrait pictures, or night pictures), you have access to the Manual (M), Speed (Tv), Aperture (Av) and Program (P) settings which allows you to more properly set the camera to take pictures you want. Mirroring most of its big sisters, this camera has nice controls over white balance and flash intensity, for example.The camera may seem small, and yes, it is pretty limited when compared to other more expensive options, but for someone who wants to learn, or for someone who is looking for a smaller, cheaper side camera, I think this is a perfect option.The only reason I took 1 star out is that I like to have a viewfinder besides a LCD screen.

Meaning few MP at resolutions people actually use.Autofocus:  Hope you like playing games trying to get the camera to focus on the correct thing in distances photos.  Anything over 25 feet good luck.Screen:  Clunky, fuzzy, pixilated, gigantic power hog.  Not a fair replacement for a classic viewfinder.Buttons:  The buttons are a bit wonky.  The \"ok\" button actually says \"func. set\" on it.  The flash button doesn't do anything on the default settings.  I can't figure out how, if possible, to delete multiple pictures at once.Battery:  Actually not bad, except that you have to remove it to charge it thereby reseting the date/time and several other settings.Other Features:  No WiFi, not the typical mini USB plug, flash needs be manually deployed, confusing menus, limited manual adjustments, basically disappointment all round.  This camera is barely a notch above a smart phone, the only thing that is an improvement is the optical zoom, and even that is a bit flaky.To be completely honest, I bought this a quick/cheap replacement for the Nikon S9700 I lost in an airport.
