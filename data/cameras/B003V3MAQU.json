I replaced an older one that was 12 years old with this one. The Samsung is easier to operate however the old one had a feature on it that I really enjoyed & this one does not. On the older one, when you had activity on the cameras a light would come on as a warning. This one does not have it. We always knew when someone was outside because the light would come on. That was great for it to warn us when someone was on the camera. Overall this Samsung is a better unit.", "Date": "December 8, 2012"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": "$1,540.00", "Features": "Sansung SRD-850DC-500\n8 Channel, 60FPS at 2 CIF and 240FPS at CIF\n500 GB with DVD Burner\nCoax Support\nH.264", "Name": "Samsung SRD-850DC-500 DVR 8CH 500GB H.264 60FPS@ 2CIF 240FPS@CIF DVD", "ImgURL": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/31%2BfMcRFOSL._SY300_.jpg", "ProductID": "B003V3MAQU"}}
