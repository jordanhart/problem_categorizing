Carlton", "ReviewID": "R1OGI8P8Y1GKCQ", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I am a professional radiographer and photographer (25 years now) and I used both the CD400, CD300, as  well as a Nikon Coolpix for this year's field research season x-raying mummies in Peru. This means the cameras  were pushed hard.....blowing sand, huge contrast ranges, high resolution radiographs needed, fast manual  control of radical light conditions, etc.....essentially most of the tough conditions and imaging requirements you  can imagine. Here's what I found:  The Sony Mavica CD300 beat them all. It's not the most expensive or the best resolution but we all thought it  did the best job.  Mavica CD400: best resolution but extremely slow recording time made it impossible to work with most of the  time....the CD300 often got 3-4 shots while the 400 was recording one.  Mavica CD300: not the best resolution, but now that I've done some prints for publication from it's highest res  setting I will not be buying any more 400s....just not a significant enough difference, plus it's not as heavy or  bulky.  Nikon Coolpix: not in the running by comparison with the Sonys....although it is more lightweight....we are  buying mini CDs for 33 cents each in bulk... and getting 140-180 high res images per CD.....they are so easy to  format, initialize, and copy on any CD burner that I can't believe we even considered using memory stiks, or  USB downloads.  The best features are common to both the Sony Mavica CD300 and 400 series though.....manual control of the  images, excellent close up abilities, decent wide angle (which can be enhanced with add-on lenses if necessary),  and both rapid video and automatic functions with night focusing for flash, etc., etc.   Finally! There is a great digital camera.", "Date": "August 20, 2002"}, {"Title": "Ideal camera for quick on-site viewing.", "Author": "Kyle Slayzar", "ReviewID": "R1AZZMRG9WG9HI", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "This is one of my more favorite cameras. I personally have the MVC-CD300 however this camera has nothing to laugh about. It's 2MP resolution makes it ideal for both printing on glossy of matte finishings, granted it does have a little graininess here and there however most digital cameras do until it reaches anything past 4MP. It is also ideal for internet usage, the pictures it saves are not to big for a dial-up user to download if you send them an e-mail with picture attachments taken by this camera.It's 3x optical zoom lens is standerd for most digital cameras and I was never fond of digital zoom since it really is not a zoom anyway.Naturely I love the cd option the best. Even though the cd size is half of that of a regular cd, it will still fit in ANY computer cd tray so you don't have to worry about compatibility.  The only compatibility you have to worry about is if your computer can support both video and jpeg files alike. The cds are very cost effective. A 156mb cd can cost anywhere between [amt] and [amt]. This may seem a lot for a cd however when you consider the fact that a compact flash, smart media or SD card with a 128mb card can cost between [amt] and [amt], it really seems like a deal, and the CD-RWs naturaly are reusable.It also has the movie taking feature which I love entirely. My Dad recorded my entire High School graduation ceremony with one cd. Granted the resolution was not top notch but when you consider the fact that you can record over an hour of footage non-stop and potentialy burn it onto a DVD (depending on what burner you have) the possibilities with this camera are endless.", "Date": "August 10, 2002"}, {"Title": "Great Camera", "Author": "Elaine N. White", "ReviewID": "R1JHOSJN2MYTXN", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This is my first digital camera and I am glad I waited.  I am just an average guy who had always used a basic 35mm for vacation & family photos and, while I had considered digital cameras for quite some time  - I was not quite convinced and was somewhat confused by the variety of cameras and storage media.  This camera changed my mind and convinced me that \"digital\" is the way to go.  While the Sony CD-250 is not the top of the line in terms of ghee-whiz features, for a non-technical person I have found it to be just superb.  The CD's (CD-R & CD-RW) are durable and have more than ample storage, the camera is easy to use, it produces great shots, has a solid feel (same size as a typical 35mm camera) and has a good battery life.  Downloading and attaching photos to e-mail or posting to the Sony photo site is quite easy.  In short, I am very pleased.  In my opinion, for the casual camera user who has been considering a digital camera, take a look at the the Sony CD series of cameras - I think you will be pleased.", "Date": "August 23, 2002"}, {"Title": "Awesome Camera", "Author": null, "ReviewID": "R1ZI0KAKB67VP6", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Don't miss this camera.

Apparently, this camera has a high failure rate (1 in 10) because of the delicacies of the CD writable construction.One other negative aspect of the CD media is that writing to the CD is slower than to other memory devices and reading the CD (when previewing images in the camera) is also slow. I think there's more value in the Canon G2 - most of the same features, but with 4.0 Megapixels and a more solid construction.

We love the capacity of the CD's, the life of the battery charge, the zoom and preview features and the general ease of use both taking pictures and printing or emailing them.

Disadvantages: bulky (same size and weight as normal SLR camera), no viewfinder, the functions are not easy to adjust (Pentax and Canon still win the easy-to-use contest, and the lens is a mediocre no-name with the Sony label stamped on it.  My recommendation is pay a little more for the same Sony disk-style digital cameras that come with the German lenses (I think Carl Zeiss or something like that) if you don't mind the bulk and like the disk format, otherwise Panasonic has a good digital camera for about the same price with a Leica lens and one extra megapixel (3.0 total) resolution.", "Date": "January 11, 2003"}, {"Title": "I don't know how I've lived without it!", "Author": null, "ReviewID": "R16K5WTG3IZT8W", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This is an awesome camera for families and those who just love to take pictures.  I prefer the CD because dealing with downloading from a memory stick is time consuming unless you're downloading to a laptop.I prefer the CD.  This camera isn't all that heavy.  In fact, I've not put it down since UPS brought it to my door.  I'm constantly capturing pictures of my two small sons.I don't have to say WE'RE OUT OF FILM anymore.  I prefer this camera to memory sticks because I like the idea of inserting a CD to just grab what I want.  There are no cords to plug in and pull out each time.It's 2 megapixels, and that' really enough for me.  You can shoot in several different modes, black and white, and even four different sizes.  I don't miss having a viewfinder either.  In fact, the LCD screen makes taking pictures that much more fun.Finally, what I most enjoy about this camera is being able to record short movies (sound and every movement) in crisp, clear color.I'll be sending our Christmas skits to family on the east coast easily this year.  This camera is worth the money you'll put into it.  You can get a really great deal on it in a lot of places.

Bianchi", "ReviewID": "R3M3WLZTFFWG8C", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "The Mavica CD-250 is a great little camera.  For the professional it is a complete solution.  For the amateur it falls just short of being a complete solution, due to the badly executed software that comes with it.Although I got this camera mere hours before leaving on a professional assignment, Day One I was fully productive. Despite the fact this is my first digital camera I learned how to make it do everything I wanted with hardly any tears or frustration. At the end of the day I was solidly sold on digital photography. (Good thing, considering the bucks I had invested!)I bought this camera to be a high-end point-and-shoot unit. The 2 MegaPixel resolution is perfectly adequate for any kind of snapshot photography.The CD-R drive was a feature I decided I HAD to have. CD-R discs are SO cheap they can be used as throw-aways. I could carry gigabytes worth of storage with me for a twenty-dollar investment. Their versatility and portability makes them vastly superior to the memory-chips other digital cameras use. And they are great as an archival storage medium -- much like having the negatives from a conventional photo shoot.One major advantage of shooting on CD-R discs is you can have several disks in use at one time, each one devoted to a different subject.  It's not like film where removing a partially-used roll and reloading it at a later date is tricky and risky.  Since you can 'Finalize' a CD-R many times you can store several 'shoots' on one disc.  Each time you 'Finalize' a disk you do waste some storage space, but CD-R's are so cheap it costs you pennies at most.  The convenience in helping to keep your shots organized is well worth the cost.A feature of the Mavica I have only just learned to use is the zoom/pan/scan ability of the camera's display screen.  Because you can zoom a stored image on the display, you can see any piece of your shot at high resolution.  This is extremely handy in making sure you've gotten a properly focused image, and that the detail you wanted was actually captured.  It's much, much more convenient than having a PC standing by so you can check your images on a high-pixel-count screen.I had posted an earlier version of this review that complained about the InfoLithium battery fully discharging in less than a week while the camera sat idle.  Whatever caused that problem has not recurred.  The battery DOES discharge slowly, as the manual says, but it has been losing only minutes of charge per week.  The manual does suggest removing the battery if you are going to store the camera for a while.  But if you are going to use the camera every week or three, this shouldn't be necessary.There may have been something I left turned on that flattened the battery faster than normal.  To date I have not figured out what that might have been.One concern remains -- the software that comes with the Mavica CD-250. As a digital photography newbie I find it incomprehensible. There is no manual. There are no on-screen prompts. Not even a 'Read Me' file. There are just a bunch of icons that offer no explanations as to what they are or what they do. A quick-start pamphlet would be a major improvement. But frankly, I'll go shopping for some better software rather than try to deal with a package that was so clearly an ill-designed afterthought.My advice. If you are looking for a point-and-shoot digital camera the Mavica CD-250 should be on your short list. It is a versatile camera made even better by the CD-R recording system.  The software is a throw-away, but then there are lots of excellent aftermarket software packages available at all levels of sophistication and pricing.  Your PC should not need any additional software to display, file or transmit your photos.  Shop for better aftermarket software at your convenience.Ed Bianchi", "Date": "February 13, 2003"}, {"Title": "MVC 250 Great Camera User Friendly", "Author": "\"digger662\"", "ReviewID": "R2FVKKZCMS24W5", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "... I like the ease of use, I can view the pictures as I take them and delete them if I want. With the included cables I can view the pictures on my TV or download through a USB port. I have been happy with the battery life, I did buy an additional AC charger, and a 2nd battery($...). Normally you use a cable to charge the battery in the camera. It tells you in the viewfinder about how long you have left on the battery in minutes of useable life. I would not hessitate to recommend this camera to any one, at 2.0 +/- megapixel it takes great quality pics and movies.
