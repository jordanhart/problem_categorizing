I recently spread my wings and bought the Samsung PL120 and love it.  It takes some time getting used to all the features and I sometimes forget how to get back to a setting in time for a great picture but all in all I am very satisfied with the camera. It takes excellent pictures with lots of cool settings.  The only thing it does not have that I liked on my other cameras is a panoramic stitching.  I like taking wide scenery pictures.  Instead I opted for the self portrait front screen and love it!  I bought it on Amazon with a package deal and it was a great price.", "Date": "August 23, 2011"}, {"Title": "Best Little Camera out there!!!", "Author": "Ray-Ray", "ReviewID": "R2HVB3OIREEQPS", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I'm a fan of Nikon cameras.  After I dropped it, it broke.  Was at a store checking it out another customer customer (a professional photographer whispered and said) I would be pleased with the Samsung \"hands-down\".  I purchased the Samsung camera and I love it.  Clearest picture out there for the category (price, etc.).  Takes realistic pictures, without too light effect.  Also the videos you take, looks like HD.  Very clear and the sound is wonderful.  The case is nice too, not cheap looking.  It is so small and light, I carry it most of the time.  The bundle is perfect for the price.  Summary:  if you're looking for a small (not too expensive) camera with great pictures, this one is it.  Oh, one more thing, I was hesitant with the re-chargeable battery, but I'm very happy with that.  At first, after the 1st charge, it ran down after about 50 pictures, but on the second charge, it is still strong at 100% after 78 pictures.  Also a great feature is that after snapping a picture, it recovers within about 2 seconds for the next picture.  My old (Nikon) camera took about 7-8 seconds, which means you're losing shots while waiting.", "Date": "December 30, 2011"}, {"Title": "Great Camera and great Deal", "Author": "Anne Lehman", "ReviewID": "R2SBP3B0SYF10B", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "My son ordered this camera to replace an earlier Samsung camera.

Took maybe 100 pictures with it. Left it at home when I deployed. Upon return to the states picked it up for the family vacation and started taking pictures. The zoom lens became stuck in the out position with error message stating that the zoom lens was malfunctioning. \"DUH\". I was directed by the Amazon vendor to contact Samsung directly as it had been to long between the time that I had bought the camera and when it started its \"glitch\". So I called the Samsung service center as directed. Guess what??? I am 2 months beyond the warranty and need to pay another $50 to get it looked at. So I basically have a $200 camera. All things considered, This package may seem like a good deal, but if Samsung will not back there product up, why bother. Just get a $200 plus camera and cut to the chase. Not a Samsung fan.
