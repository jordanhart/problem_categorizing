YOU MUST BE VERY COMPUTER LITERATE AND KNOWLEDGABLE ENOUGH TO KNOW WHAT EQUIPMENT YOU NEED TO OPERATE THIS SYSTEM.  Misleading when viewing picture.  If you are a novice, the picture appears to have a dvr recorder.  When actually it is a dvr capture card. I had never heard of a dvr capture card. I needed an affordable security system for my small business and this system appeared to fit my needs.  NOT FOR THE NOVICE. There was no power supply.  If you assume that you will get every thing you need to operate these cameras then you are in a rut. If you do not order the AV CABLE that you need, you are stuck! If you are in a rush like I was, you will need to purchase individual 12 volt dc plugs for each camera and four very expensive boxes of CCTV cable wire $49.99 (Radio Shack Brand) per 50 feet @ Radio Shack. I'm sure there is less expensive.  But when you are short on time and knowledge, you pay for it.  It should be explained in bold letters that you NEED AV wire which has its own power supply and is very inexpensive when you purchase from the company.  This wire is impossible to find in local stores.  I found none.  I needed my system up ASAP and had already paid for expedited shipping. I spent an additional $300 dollars on wiring, dc plugs and extension cords", "Date": "January 8, 2008"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": "$849.95", "Features": "Easier to use Real time display with multi-screen views\nSmaller file size, High image compression based on H.263 Algorithm\nRecords Higher Quality Images. 30 fps display and 30 fps recording\nAdvanced Search Features including graphed recording chart\nPackage includes: 4 of color dome cameras, 1 of DVR Card with 4 Channel input, 1 x 4 channel power supply and Free surveillance Decals", "Name": "VideoSecu 4 Channel PCI DVR Video Capture Card Home CCTV Security Surveillance System with 4 of Color CCD Dome Cameras, Power Supply and Free Stickers 1HW", "ImgURL": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/5116pXmXVeL._SY300_.jpg", "ProductID": "B000X6P13W"}}
