Even at 10 feet away you couldn't get a good enough picture of an intruders face to ID them. Another problem is that the system operates at 2.4GHZ like so many wireless devices today and even after I turned everything off in my house that uses the same frequency the picture kept flashing with lots of lines in it. This was at a distance of about 20 feet from the receiver. So apparently my neighbors wireless devices were interfering with the cameras signal. I called Q See about these issues and they told me that most people have to use a wired camera.", "Date": "August 1, 2007"}, {"Title": "Disappointed with quality", "Author": "ALKJ", "ReviewID": "R3AJ6I6ICU1C3G", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "I don't recommend this. The quality is poor. The wireless signal is poor and the picture is full of lines. The cable that came with it did not work so I had to replace it in order to get it to work in the first place. I would look for a different brand.", "Date": "May 6, 2007"}, {"Title": "Sucks", "Author": "Algernon", "ReviewID": "R3A8ZARL2ZHKAC", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "Bought this camera for my mom and dad who live in a high-crime area of town.
