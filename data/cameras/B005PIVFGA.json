{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Very good image quality & features, tough to adjust", "Author": "greybear125 \"greybear125\"", "ReviewID": "R2GWIPT3AYY4BT", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "This camera offers 700TVL resolution and very good features, with a good 9-22 zoom range.  The field of depth is quite shallow so careful focus on the point you wish to capture is essential.  The focus and zoom controls are internal to the device, so it may be awkward to adjust when mounted, but this does add some security to the install as well.On my unit the IR stopped working after a couple of days of testing, but this was traced to a loose wire from the control board.  Re-seating the connector fixed the problem.", "Date": "January 22, 2012"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": "$602.45", "Features": "Built-in 1/3\" Sony Effio CCD, 700 TVL high resolution, enabling to obtain more natural high-definition video\nWeatherproof aluminum outdoor housing, stand for use in all weather conditions.
