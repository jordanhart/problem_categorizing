It's not exactly tiny, but it's not huge either. It's about the same size as a 35mm SLR with a small normal lens. It's as fast, if not faster, than digicams without moving parts. You can't hear the disc spinning unless you're in a quiet room and you actually put your ear up to the camera and listen carefully. The rechargeable battery that comes with it lasts over 2 hours easy (or well over 200 shots). Not bad for a cam with a CD burner and a huge LCD.The pros:Carl Zeiss lens. Name brand lens known among professionals for its high quality.Big fat beautiful LCD. Its impressive. Several people can gather around and watch movies or images taken with the camera.It can record movies. I know a lot of digicams can do this as a bonus feature, but lets face it no one uses this feature because most digicams [are bad] at taking movies. NOT THIS ONE. it takes very good movies. so you'll actually use the movie feature. about 6 min of video (640x480) with audio on a 156MB CD. There is a good mic and good speaker (for playback).The MENUS ARE GREAT. A lot of people overlook this detail. What do i mean? well, digicams use menus for changing settings. with most of them, the menus are confusing and stupid. like you have to dig through 2 submenus and hit ok 5 times before you can change the image size/resolution. not this camera! the menus are clear and simple and there are no submenus! even a novice can pick this up and figure it out without studying an instruction manual. for example: to change image size/resolution you simply hit the image size button push up or down (theres 5 different sizes) then thats it. also there buttons for commonly used things like changing flash mode and switching to macro (close up) mode. i also love the jog dial. this is for manual focus as well as for changing the shutter speed and aperture on the fly WITHOUT ANY... MENUS! you have to actually use the camera to appreciate how important this is.the infolithium battery that comes with it is nice. it tells you EXACTLY how much time you have left (like 113min instead of a stupid little meaningless battery icon). if you want another battery, (strongly recommended) its expensive though. it's nice to be able to use the camera without constantly worrying about how much battery life is remaining.CD-RW discs cost next to nothing. its very cool to be able to take a disc out and pop it into any computer to view images. it comes with usb cable and a/v cable for tv viewing. no remote control though :-(the built-in flash is very good. range is little over 16feet. not bad at all for built-in. there's a hot shoe if youre hardcore and want to get a bigger flash.The cons:expensive proprietary rechargeable batteries and no streaming USB. whats streaming USB? with it you can hook up a digicam to your computer and use it as a webcam on steroids. not many digicams have this feature though.

This means the cameras were pushed hard.....blowing sand, huge contrast ranges, high resolution radiographs needed, fast manual control of radical light conditions, etc.....essentially most of the tough conditions and imaging requirements you can imagine. Here's what I found:The Sony Mavica CD500 & 300 beat them all. It's not the most expensive or the best resolution but we all thought it did the best job.Mavica CD500: best of all....resolution, reasonable recording time, great image control for exposure, close-ups, better controls, pretty much everythingMavica CD400: best resolution but extremely slow recording time made it impossible to work with most of the time....the CD300 often got 3-4 shots while the 400 was recording one.Mavica CD350: not enough manual control for us, but usually got great images on automatic....some problems with exposure range for close-ups thoughMavica CD300: not the best resolution, but now that I've done some prints for publication from it's highest res setting I will not be buying any more 400s....just not a significant enough difference,plus it's not as heavy or bulky.Nikon Coolpix: not in the running by comparison with the Sonys....although it is more lightweight....we are buying mini CDs for 33 cents each in bulk... and getting 140-180 high resimages per CD.....they are so easy to format, initialize, and copy on any CD burner that I can't believe we even considered using memory stiks, or USB downloads.The best features are common to both the Sony Mavica CD300 and 400 series though.....manual control of the images, excellent close up abilities, decent wide angle (which can be enhanced with add-on lenses if necessary), and both rapid video and automatic functions with night focusing for flash, etc., etc.Finally!

I had a really good experience over those 4 years with the other Mavica.Wanting to take advantage of the current technology in digital photography, I don't think I could have chosen better.The quality of the 5mp photos is outstanding.  This is a digital photograph that can really compete with film photography.  I can't say enough about the clarity and detail that this captures.  You'll have to see it to believe it.I was able to install the software on my Windows XP home edition after a very quick phone call to the software mfg which is listed on the envelope.  For XP - don't download the first driver on the list of options.  The second option - Image Maker - is the only one you need and it installs fine.  You see - the first option on the list isn't needed for Windows XP.The storage on mini-CD's is perfect...and a much cheaper alternative to having film developed.

This is by far absolutely the best camera I could find, and I've been using it for everything lately, not just the research.

With Windows XP & USB 2.0, I was taking photos and viewing them on my PC within minutes of opening the box, although I see that some of the more advanced features will take me a while to master.  I chose this particular camera for 3 reasons; my previous experience with a Sony Mavica, the 5MP quality and the mini-CD. I frequently wish to access the images on my PC after taking only a very few photos, so I quickly learned that \"finalizing\" the CD-RW each time before inserting it into the PC is impractical (I was unaware of this step prior to purchase, but it is necessary for the PC's CD drive to read it).  Not to worry!  Using the USB cable, (no drivers required for Windows XP/USB 2.0) the images are accessible immediately, so you can wait until the CD is full & finalize just once.  Of course, you would want to wait until a CD-R was full before finalizing it anyway.Amazon's product description of the camera's features is excellent, so I don't need to restate them all here.

I've enjoyed using it very much. Once you learn the controls, you can almost effortlessly take great photos. On many occasions people have remarked how clear the photos are. The high quality Carl Zeiss Vario-Sonnar glass lens and 5.0 megapixel resolution see to that!The camera is smart enough to adjust itself for most lighting situations. If you must, you can manually set the camera to get the effect you want. The large, bright, clear color LCD screen on the back of the camera works very well - it seems to be \"what you see is what you get\". There is no problem viewing the image in bright daylight.Besides the high resolution and fine lens, the BIG selling point for me was the built in 3-inch CD drive. Being able to store approximately 50 snaphots at the highest resolution setting is just fantastic. No more film to buy or have processed. I bought a 5-pack of 210MB CD-RW disks for $10. Compare that to the expensive, low capacity memory sticks that other digital cameras require and it's a no brainer.Once the CD is full, I connect the Mavica to my Macintosh with the USB cable, download the pictures into iPhoto and that's all there is to it. Then I use the format function of the camera to erase the CD-RW and I'm ready to use the same CD thousands of times!I love the feel of the camera as it simply oozes quality. It doesn't fit in your shirt pocket, but since it's packed with so many features that's okay by me. I bought it here at Amazon and got it at a great price.I would like the Mavica CD500 even better if it had a 10X optical zoom rather than just a 3X. But even with a 3X zoom I can get outstanding results.

This camera is loaded with features that can make even a novice look like they know what they are doing.  If you are new to photgraphy, the auto settings make taking quality photos easy.  If you are already an expert, the many adjustable settings allow for needed tweaking for special effects and different environmental conditions.  The camera uses pocket CD-R/CD-RW's which are the three inch version of a tyical CD.  With a little effort one can find these CD's for very low prices at stores that carry computer products.  The pocket CD's work in almost every PC with a CD-ROM drive and are handy to pass around between friends.  For the cost of other types of digital media it is possible to buy hundreds of pocket CD'S.Overall, this camera spans the gap between novice and expert, new guy to old pro, and makes photography fun again.

The picture quality, with 5 mega pixels is amazing.  The detail and colors that come through are great, much more than what I would expect for a digital camera.  There is so much you can do with the camera and still have not learned everything.  I was concerned when I purchased this camera that it would take long before you could take one picture to the next- due to the CD burner.  I read in someone's review that this was a problem with them.  I have not have had any such problem and I am able to take a picture right after another.  It appears it stores the photo within an internal memory if it is still recoding the prior on the CD.  I also love the fact you can store so many photos on single CD which I can buy for less than 50 cents a cd.  I also enjoy using the movie mode to capture videos. Although it is not the quality of a camcorder, the quality is pretty decent and you can record about 6 minutes on a 210mb 3 inch cd-r.  I would be careful not to have the lens zoomed when recording because it seems to lessen the video quality.  You also can not zoom in or out while in the video mode.  I would also be careful when buying accessories for this camera.  I bought two filter and the adapter that attaches to the camera and I think they are great because I can protect the lens.  I also bought the starter accesory kit which includes the carrying bag, an extra battery and 3 CD-RW.  I believe I purchased this for 60 dollars.  If you factor in the price for the battery and the CDs, it is a little over 60 dollars so I thought this was a deal because I was getting a camera case as well.  Unfotunately the case just fits the camera (and it is a VERY SOFT case- so do not expect it to protect it if you tend to be rough) but now it no longers fits in with the adapter/filter attchment.  That is something to be careful about.One other point is the LCD screen.  It is very large and I think it goes great with the camera.  There is no viewfinder though and it can be a little difficult to see if there is bright sunshine on the screen, although it does work well outside.  There is also an atchment sold for this where you can use a view finder.  I plan on purchasing that as well in the future.The zoom on the lens is only 3x.  Although I would prefer more it still is great.As my last note, between the camera itself and the attachments I have, it is large.  Some people have complained about the size of the camera.  It is about the size of a small SLR camera.  If you are looking for something small, don't purchase this one, go with a simple point and shoot.  Yet, if size is not an issue and you want a great camera than this is the way to go.  I bought this camera for 450- on sale.  I would definitely wait and look around before shelling out 600 which most places have this priced for.

We bought the CD Mavica and the more I use it, the more I like it!!! . My (our) CD Mavica is ready when you need it, no film to buy or to drop off. Discs are inexpensive and easy to find, even in Sydney.  Crickey!Once you get used to the delay, you'll get pretty good at \"seeing\" a photo opportunity. Delete and have another go straight away, recommended for fidddly toddler subjects.The size of the screen allows people with less-than-perfect vision to have a look a the pictures. My in-laws love that. To me the best quality of this camera is it's flexibility. Although I must say that the software that comes with it did not work in my  iMac, I still can download still photos without any problems or special settings. I use the USB port on my keyboard and iMac starts iPhoto automatically, one more click and we're home!, without finalizing the disc. I have not been able to watch any of the movies yet. Another great way to see the photos and is on TV, playing them straight from the camera.

When he passed away, I looked at this Sony camera sitting on the shelf and decided I was going to learn to use it. I'm not a technical person so I can't go into all the technicalities of the cells, apertures, etc. that so many other people speak about.But what I CAN tell you is that I started an online website, Atlanta Vintage Jewelry dot com, and all the pictures there (over 1400 so far) have been taken with this camera. I found it relatively easy to learn (with the help of the instruction book). It has great features, close-up capabilities, various white balances, spot metering, timer, and such that I use regularly.My graphics program is Photoshop. After taking the pics, the camera simply connects to my PC, and after reading the CD source in the camera I can import them right into the program for editing. It also has a threaded lens so it accepts filters and additional lenses, if needed.I love this camera. My husband also had some other camera brands (i.e. Olympus) and after working with them, I chose this Sony as my favorite. Bulky? A little. But it's immaterial.The only negative I can say is that you have to keep the camera steady once you've snapped the picture until the red light goes out (writing info to the interior disc). Otherwise the data may not show up. To virtually eliminate this problem, I now use a tabletop tripod and the camera's timer.I've taken self portraits successfully. It takes great distance shots. I've only changed the little CD once, and they're relatively inexpensive compared to memory sticks. The camera has a built in flash but also a hot shoe to accept bounce flashes or whatever.I like it and I think you will, too.Gail Gupton, Author: 'The 31-Day Diet of Spiritual Enlightenment', and 'Seekers of Truth'.", "Date": "February 27, 2005"}, {"Title": "They took something nice and downgraded it a bit...", "Author": "K.

Why is it that they had a perfectly wonderful menu system on the 300 and 400 but felt the urge to mess that up on the CD500?  Everything is difficult to find now!  Don't get me wrong, it is a great camera, but the ease of use is part of it too.  And what in the world happened to the Black and White photos?  I can't find any setting for taking those pictures!  Another person mentioned that on the review.  I don't think it does Black and White.  I miss that feature so much!The 3x optical zoom is very mediocre...  and their \"smart system\" of zooming is a bit of a joke...  you can only really use the zoom properly if you are taking lower resolution pictures, or you can't take advantage of it.It is reasonably priced for a 5 megapixel.  The CD recording is absolutely fantastic and the media price is just right (provided you don't waste your money on Mavica disks).  Just purchase the less expensive ones.

Pros first:The CD media is excellent.  These can be bought at Walmart or on line in bulk or in computer stores all very inexpensively.  I use the standard 160K or so size picture which is easily e-mailable and the CD will hold about 1,200 of these.  If you use the smaller 80 K you can double that but the clairty losses some.  I have made 8x10 prints of the 165K size and they picture is excellent, even won a place in a national calendar with a shot of that size.One psrson said she could not do black and white, if you scroll thru the excellent menu or read the manual this is not at all a difficult task.  There are many options from full automatic to full manual and many other options if you read the manual or scroll thru the index.The CD holds so many that a small inventory will last for a long vacation with lots of pic taking.  Extra 3rd party batteries are easy to find as also are external battery chargers including adapter cords for the cigerette lighter in a car.Uploading is a cynch.  In XP just plug the USB in to the camera and computer and turn the camera on.  In a moment the system sees the camera as an external hard drive and you can simply copy and paste at will.  I user the CD-RW so when all done I reformat the CD in the camera and am ready to go again.  I use 3rd party software for photo enhancement/cropping which adds an excellent dimension to your end results to fix what a novice messed up but now to look perfect.Camera has built in flash which works fine but with optional lenses you need the external add on flash.  I have both and they are awesome.  The camera has a laser to read ambient light and distance, it talks to the flash for sync and the photo is perfect.  Macro needs a pro for close ups but even an amature can do well if careful.  Repeat shots to experiment are so cheap why not do so and learn!The optional lens adapter ring is invaluable even if you do not use optional lens add ons where you can put a filter on to protect the lens.  The adapter ring also protects the moving lens from dust and damage, a most important safety feature, well worth the cost.Third party manufacturors make products from lenses to flashes to batteries to chargers to CDs and anything else that camera could use at a cost far less than Sony asks and they all work fine.Over all this is the finest camera I have ever owned, have had a wide variety of film cameras and quite a few digitals.  The only option that is worthless is the add on view finder, that really needs to be thrown out and re-engineered from scratch.Sony and others offer add on wide angle, fish eye, and telephoto lenses.  I really do not see need for any but I do have the wide angle lens on my camera and use it all the time.  One needs to be careful on zoom that if you zoom in with the optional lens and especially if you have a filter you will get rounded corner shadows.  That is not a fault of the camera but moreso of the lens.  The standard camera has a wide enough field of view as is for indoor shots and tele capabilities for distance.  Again add on lenses usually are not needed where the camera is all but totally self contained camera set.Cons:  The buttons on the back are located where your thumb will go and you will  inadvertantly toggle things you never wanted to toggle.  Also the main control button is very small and difficult use.  The Cybershot uses the same kind of control but the center button is larger and flat making it much easier to use. This camera could use that part and a better location.There is a lag time between shots especially between movie shots.  Movies can be a few seconds to over an hour per CD. But the record time is a mechanical process that takes time as opposed to the memory sticks, but the record time is far less but does require a bit of time.  The longer the movie the longer record time needed.  The camera needs to be held gently and still during recording, but this is a camer, not a jack hammer.  But the flexibility and cost effectiveness makes the CD over all the choice to beat all.The CD will not work in your computer unless you finialize it in the camera.  If you do that, then any unused space on the CD is lost, but the cost of the CD is cheap enough that this is moot.  This camera will work fine on XP and a CD is included for W-2000 which also works well.  With the CD huge storage of 2,400 small pixel up to 90 large pixel shots per CD they put the memory stick into the trunk, way past the back seat!  As of Jan 2006 I don't see Sony offering these anymore, but is a shame where this is the vest camera they ever made.  Maybe the next one will use the new DVD which makes all this even cheaper by adding many times the storage on the same size media.Over all the camera is fully inclusive for the novice or pro giving any level of photog almost any option he/she may want. The manual is well written and complete.  The menu on the camera is also complete.  As with any very high end camera you will need to spend some time learning all this camera can do and has to offer.  If you don't want to do that, then buy a cheap camera and live with the results.  If you buy this one you will have photo quality and versatility equal to or better than the most expensive film camera.  Buying this camera will not ever be a regrettable move unless you do not follow instructions (duh).The external lenses are fine but if used with the internal flash you will get a shadow on the picture.  The only way is to have the external flash unit if using the optional lenses.", "Date": "January 29, 2006"}, {"Title": "What a great camera", "Author": "A.

The colors are true and sharp in pictures from broad daylight through flash and still captures very good details under low light conditions without flash. Closeup photography is outstanding and I have taken some excellent pictures from a distance of about 10 cms.2) Very easy menu selections - One other reviewer also mentioned this as a point that many users tend to overlook and I second his opinion. You don't have to dig 2-3 levels deep to change camera setting, especially if you are using manual setup.3) Big fat LCD screen allows easy viewing.4) Though its not meant to operate as a camcorder, it does make an excellent movie. The sound capture is very sensitive and the in-built speaker is very good.5) Easy transfer to you computer thought USB cable (provided). I use Win XP and it is a breeze for me to transfer the pictures from camera to the computer using XP's camera wizard. Can also be connected directly for viewing on a TV screen.6) For permanent storage, you can also finalize the CD and just pop it in the computer whenever you want to view. Mini CDs are dirt cheap (compare them to flash media of equivalent capacity). SONY recommends using MAVICA CDs (of course), which are a little costly. I have been using Maxell mini CDRs without hitch (available at Wal-Mart for about $6.00 for a 10 pk). Camera keeps giving annoying reminder to use mavica CDs, just ignore it.7) Hot shoe pod to attach external flash for enthusiasts, though the built-in flash has a very good range (about 14 feet under auto exposure conditions).8) Like the weight and feel of it.9) Very Good battery life between charges.Cons:1) 3x zoom is a minor disappointment especially as the digital zoom is worthless.2) There is no temporary storage for picture, where one can review a picture before deciding to burn it on the CD. The camera does have option to \"delete\" which is a misnomer. All the camera does is not show the file if you choose delete, even though the picture will be on your CD. If its a CDR, you are stuck with it as soon as you have clicked the picture, at least you can reformat if using a CDRW.3) The bundled software from SONY is C-R-A-P. As I mentioned before, I use WinXP (home and professional) camera wizard to transfer the pictures by USB. (Cons # 1-3 are my primary reasons for giving this camera 4 stars).4) The lag time between two pictures can be as great as 6-10 seconds, especially as the CD gets full, so it may not be the best for taking a series of single pictures rapidly. You can however take upto 16 exposures at a time in multiburst mode (and I am guessing here, the lag time might be greater before you can take another multiple series with a single click).5) The laser lens for burning the CDs might be sensitive if the camera experiences more than the usual rough and tumble. I have taken this camera on many vacations, through all sorts of weather without any trouble,  still I take care not to bang it against something hard.

I never, ever had a problem with it, and it went everywhere with me. I took around 8,000 photos with it and it was wonderful. But then it was stolen from around my neck by a gang of thugs in St Petersburg, Russia in 2005.The insurance company replaced the 400 with this model, the MVCCD500, which I was very excited about getting - the next-generation model, with improved picture quality and more megapixels. How wrong I was to be excited.This piece of junk lasted a total of 6 months before it suddenly stopped doing what it was meant to do. It suddenly and without warning wasn't able to access a disc that hadn't been finalised, and after changing batteries it wasn't able to access the disc. To top this off, it also now can't write any photo taken on 5 megapixels - all I get is a 'Disc Error' everytime I take a 5 megapixel photo. I now have to finalise the disc when the battery gets low, and I have to be very, very careful the back door (where the CD-R goes in) and the battery door don't open .I relocated to the UK soon after getting this camera, and Sony UK refused to honour the 'Worldwide Warranty', even though I had the receipt and the warranty with me. As the camera came from Australia, Sony refused to even deal with me - they told me I had to talk to Sony Australia ... on the other side of the planet, and then asked me to leave their premises!I am now struggling to take ANY photos with this thing. It is now out of warranty, only takes 1 in 3 photos properly (none in 5 megapixels), and to top it all off, the 8cm CD-R's are next to impossible to buy outside the USA. And you can't even mail-order them from the US - no shop will sell them overseas. Sony couldn't even help me to locate a supplier of the CD-R's in the UK, even when they featured the Sony CD-R's on the Sony UK web site. In response to my enquiry regarding the discs, I was told they couldn't help me and suggested I do a search on an internet search engine for them. (Gee Sony, I hadn't thought of that. Thanks for the help.) I eventually found one shop in central London that sells them. When this shop stops selling them, the camera will be a useless paperweight.If you are stupid enough to buy this camera, expect it to stop working within a year of buying it, and expect zero support from Sony. In fact, just expect abuse from Sony when it stops working.I have just bought a Nikon D80, and am thrilled with the brilliance of this camera. Buy a digital camera from a manufacturer of real cameras, not a company that produces junk. Obviously Sony have given up on this technology, and tough luck if you were fooled into buying it.
