{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Great introduction to m4/3", "Author": "a scientist", "ReviewID": "R11F2HLIULKP4C", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "This review is in response to recent price movements for this camera.  It's now offered around two-thirds the MSRP.  I don't expect the price to go back up too much.  This is the same money as a good point-and-shoot.  For that, you get a really lightweight SLR-style camera with pretty good ergonomics and good features.  I had used Panasonic point-and-shoots for the last six or seven years and have always been really pleased with the performance and build quality.  However, I wanted more detail in my pictures and better low light ability.  This camera has a better flash, a bigger sensor (not in terms of megapixels, but in terms of physical size, meaning similar sized image files of about 5 Mb per file, but less useless noise).  The user interface is good, allowing more experimentation than my old Panasonic point-and-shoots.  I feel like I have some growing room.  Also, I tried the Olympus PEN E-PL1 competitor and found the autofocus system incredibly annoying.  It was slow OR constantly hunting loudly.  I love the feel of the G10/G1 much more than the E-PL1 (or the GF1 for that matter - I was surprised by that).The real thing that sets this camera apart is the interchangeable lenses.  I was able to buy an Olympus 9-18mm lens to get breathtaking landscapes that are 18mm equivalent ultra-wide, without stitching together pictures to make panoramas.So why only four stars?  Well, I prefer the G1, which this camera is supposed to replace.  That camera may still be available from Amazon for a very good price not too much more than this camera.  My advice: buy the G1.  It has a better screen (with articulation), better viewfinder (with a nifty sensor to detect when you're using it!), and a much better kit lens.  I know the lenses look very similar and the one for the G10 is lighter, but it's a significantly worse lens.  Even I can tell the difference!  Since the whole point of this camera for me was to buy good glass and occasionally replace the body, it did not make sense to invest in this particular kit.That having been said, if you can't do the extra sixty dollars or need a movie mode, this is still a great camera.  I'd also have a look at the GF1, although that's the price that the G10 is supposed to be.  Both make the G2 look conspicuously over-priced right now, although that touch screen is cool.  As far as lenses, I recommend the Panasonic 20mm f1.7 lens and the Olympus M Zuiko 9 - 18mm (don't worry about lack of image stabilization on this one).", "Date": "September 29, 2010"}, {"Title": "Quite a Jewel!", "Author": "Roberto Vicente \"bodhiu\"", "ReviewID": "R24PSYQUWXRX7F", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Just received my G10, getting a special deal on Amazon.  I've had numerous dslrs and I'm glad to be the proud owner of this camera.  Finally not lugging around heavy equipment while getting quality pictures.  Checkout my downloads.First is how small this camera is--very.  It is an all plastic body but feels good in the hands, is easy to control and get off shots (I wouldn't take the camera on a camping trip, but it is good for day to day shooting and weekends).  The kits lens is excellent (check out my uploaded photos--sharp, detail, well toned and colorful images).  I have only shot in RAW and the quality is superb.  The lens is very small...and quality.  The camera performs very fast, focuses fast.  There are many, many features.  I like the set up of 1-3 different film modes so you can set up different look and takes, including b/w all in one series of shots.  I would have liked more photo editing features in the camera, but this isn't essential.I shot some HDR movies and the quality was excellent.  The camera focuses well throughout the panning.Image stabilization in the lens works well.  To be honest, the G10 has the sharpest photos of any camera I've shot right out of the camera.  Excellent color rendition.  Didn't make one exposure mistake.The G10 is the paired down version of the G2.  You save about $200 with the G10--no swivel LCD screen, view finder EVF isn't the sharpest quality but acceptable, and there is no automatic or instant button for video (all you have to do is turn the dial to video and press the shutter button to start recording video, easily done), but the G10 has the same photo engine and processing.  No loss in quality.  However, you do want to shoot in RAW...big difference from the weaker Jpeg.Considerable drop off in Jpeg.  You will want to shoot in RAW which is outstanding.  For your information RAW + fine jpeg allows for the highest quality RAW image (this is what the manual says.  You'll also see the difference between the RAW and jpeg image--jpeg is weak!).On a very cloudy overcast day I shot in ISO 640 and thought there was a fair amount of noise.  ISO 100-200 is recommended.Battery life is outstanding as I've shot more than 500 RAW shots with charge.  Also, the manual is better than most manual and guides the user quite easily.I will write more as I proceed with the camera. This camera is a winner.  The micro four thirds dslr is the way of the future and cameras will undoubtedly get even beter.  Can't wait to see what else will come out.  Good by to the old and heavy dslrs!", "Date": "October 14, 2010"}, {"Title": "A great \"bridge\" camera", "Author": "LoEndMaestro \"poteat5\"", "ReviewID": "R3MR1XRUTHW34V", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "My wife & I pulled the trigger on the Panasonic Lumix DMC G10 after doing much research & checking various reviews & Consumer Reports.We were fed up with our cheap compact digital camera & were tired of missing a lot of memories due to its low quality & frustrating shutter lag.The Lumix is a great choice for those who want an affordable pro quality camera & have \"limited\" photography skills. Don't be fooled, it has TONS of options and is honestly a little too much camera for me, but its very intuitive, easy to operate & has a great auto setting.The pictures are spectacular & the video capabilities are impressive as well. Sure you could spend a lot more for some other cameras, but if you're just a regular person who wants a nice camera that will take good pictures of his kid, you may want to give this one a try.A good bridge camera to take you from the compact digital camera world to the DSLR world.", "Date": "January 21, 2011"}, {"Title": "A Great Transitional Camera from Point-and-Shoot", "Author": "jimbu", "ReviewID": "R3NFU83VRJKOHX", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "For the novice photographer who wants a full complement of photo features this camera will provide many features such as scene mode, close-up mode, portrait mode, sports mode. The camera also offers auto-focus single view and auto-focus continuous view for action shots. For the more advanced user, you can bracket shoot or shoot multiple images. Also, for those who have experience with film SLRs, you can use aperture, shutter, manual ( a combination of both aperture and shutter priorities as well as custom selections that allow you to choose film types and shooting priorities. It's exceptionally quick to choose menu items and very easy as well. Image quality is very sharp and clear and color rendition is very good. I have printed images at 16X 20 and found no fall off at the corners nor any problems with detail or color capture. I am not interested in the video capacity of this camera. I am an SLR film camera shooter who has worked for national magazines and news media, and I find this camera is a fun and wonderful camera to work with. It's small size is very handy, and a real treat is the capacity of this Micro four thirds camera to accept lenses from other cameras. Thus, I could use my old Nikon glass with an adapter, which I purchased at relatively low cost. You should be careful of what adapter you purchase. I found the Rainbowimaging Nikon adapter to be an exceptional purchase that is eminently serviceable. This adapter is available from Amazon from the company. This camera does not have vibration reduction capacity, but that isn't really a hindrance. I note that recent consumer demand has meant an increase of about a hundred dollars for this exceptional camera. Bodies alone (as of this writing) go for about $339 on Amazon, which is a good deal, and about $4898 with the kit lens-- the G Vario 14-42 zoom, which is sharp but not terrifically fast. A great purchase is the Panasonic 20 MM, which runs about $399. This is an exceptional lens that is approximately equivalent to the old SLR film 50 MM lens and also is great for close up work. Color and detail are very sharp with this glass. Vario lenses are plastic mounts as are most lenses these days. They are yet serviceable, easy to mount, and produce very good results. While the system is TTL (Through The Lens) this is not a mirror-based SLR like Nikon or Canon digitals. Beware of dust getting in the camera, though there is an automatic cleaning systemthat is extremely simple to use. The instruction book for this camera leaves a bit to be desired, I would say, but with some experimentation, you can figure out everything you need to know to shoot beautiful crisp imagery. I use this as a secondary camera on my pro. shoots. In fact, sometimes I prefer it to my Nikon. It's quick and the results are more than acceptable. For ease of use, price, and image results, the G-10 is a great choice. Have fun with the G-10. You won't be sorry you purchased this little gem of a camera.", "Date": "April 18, 2011"}, {"Title": "Very pleased", "Author": "Joseph S,", "ReviewID": "R3TVR6EBQGDSZ7", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I've read the other 8 reviews, most of them say \"just got\" or \"took first pictures\" or some such so I felt obliged to write.  I got my G10 in late October 2010 and I have used it in multiple situations since then.  I also have the 45mm - 200mm Panasonic zoom lens.  (When I bought these the G10 was $399 and the zoom lens was under $300 - price rise lately is surprising). I've shot some movie clips of a choir performance, where the ability to zoom while recording, and to adjust exposure compensation while filming were very much appreciated by me.  I kind of take auto focus during movie recording for granted, but note that many DSLRs cannot do that, or cannot do it nearly as well as any micro four thirds camera.  About stills, the JPEGS are quite good but not the pumped up (highly saturated) colors that, for example, Canon is known for.  Looks more realistic, kind of like Nikon jpegs. I've started shooting raw and I think I'm going to keep doing that. The camera seems more than fast enough, I don't notice a speed difference.  And the ability to play with the .rw2 files in Adobe Camera Raw is liberating, I don't think I can overstate it.  After a picture is converted to JPEG - with the Gamma curve imposed, only 8 bits per color, and black clip and white clip levels imposed, there's a lot you just can't do in post processing.  But with the .rw2 file you get to adjust the black and white clip levels, the overall brightness with the \"exposure\" control, the response curve with the \"brightness\" control, you get to adjust the luminance noise reduction amount (and chroma noise, but I haven't seen that to be necessary).  It's pretty amazing to me to get ISO 800 images developed from raw that look perfect to me even at 100% magnification, and developed from ISO 1600 that look very close to perfect (noise reduction has an effect on resolution, but only visible at 100% magnification; looks perfect in an 8x10 print).I used to use a film SLR. Developing color film was not within my capability - sending in film and getting back prints is kind of like shooting JPEG images.  When I went digital first I had a Canon A70, then sold the film SLR and got a Panasonic FZ7 superzoom - I loved it, but with the small sensors on those cameras shooting at ISO 100 was pretty much the only viable option to avoid noise.  I thought it was a difficult decision for me to get rid of the FZ7 and go to the G10 because I'd need two lenses - the kit lens plus the 45-200mm zoom - to approximately cover the range I had with the FZ7.  Looking back now, it should not have been a difficult decision. The images I get out of the G10 are better in several ways - lower noise, more control over depth of field, using raw is a joy - \"developing\" color images to MAKE a jpeg is still amazing and wonderful to me.And - I have to say the electronic view finder is much better than the one on the FZ7.  I looked through the G10 and the G2 viewfinder one right after the other before I bought the G10.  I could not see a significant difference. The FZ7's viewfinder didn't have enough resolution but I lived with it; the G10's does have enough resolution for me; the G2's has more than enough - maybe it's just me, but I didn't see a great gain in resolution in the G2's EVF even though I know it's really there.For someone moving up from a point and shoot or super zoom, the G10 - as the least expensive micro four thirds model - is a real and significant step up to the micro four thirds camera system, without breaking the bank.", "Date": "April 15, 2011"}, {"Title": "Fantastic Camera", "Author": "Glen", "ReviewID": "R3FSXVK6JLQ9DN", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I upgraded to the DMC-G10 from a Canon prosumer point-and-shoot, coincidentally also named G10, which I was starting to feel limited by. Reviews here, as well as many technical reviews online cover everything well. I will say that it is a comfortable upgrade for those used to point-and-shoots, with a great one-button auto mode, but also easily accessible manual controls.Apart from amazing image quality, this camera's (and the m43 format's) greatest strength is its superb performance with vintage manual SLR lenses. Adapters are available for all formats and are cheap. I use a Canon 50mm f1.8 FD lens, with really great results.The G10's only weakness is a pretty abysmal electronic viewfinder. I never rely on it to frame images, fortunately, but be aware that it is functional, but very low quality. At this price they had to cut corners somewhere.Finally, do yourself a favor and buy the Lumix 20mm f1.7 pancake lens. The kit lens is decent, but not ideal as an general purpose lens. The 20/1.7 costs about as much as the camera, but it brings out the full potential of the camera and is a pleasure to use.

The Sony system is still my go-to gear for \"photo days\", but needed a simpler,lighter camera that would still shoot quality images. The manager at my favorite camera store suggested the Panasonic Lumix G-10...and offered a great price.Now that I've used in for about six months...I'm in love!  The G-10 travels well, carries easily and makes wonderful pictures.  Auto modes to priority modes all do well, color is very balanced and the resolution is sparkling.  I'm told that having the sensor closer to the lens in the micro four thirds system accounts for it.  Jpegs are crisp, and the RAW pics are a joy to edit in perature.Nice to have a eye piece viewer for when the sun is bright, but the 3\" screen gets most of the use.  The menus and buttons allow for quick adjustments and the live preview is really great to work with.I can recommend this camera.  It's great for a beginner or someone who just wants good, easy pictures.  It is also a super \"second\" camera for the more avid photographer.

The one negative to the camera is flash pictures.  As much as I like natural light shots there are times when it is nice to have a flash.  Perhaps because I seldom take flash shots I haven't spent a lot of time trying to determine if there is a special light setting that would give decent results, but the results we get are not color correct, generally overexposed and very flat.Otherwise it is a lot of camera in a small package at a reasonable price.12-30-2013 AdditionI had bad flash results over the holidays and decided to go back to the DMC-G10 Operating manual.  It turns out I had the camera flash mode set on a setting that tries to keep the background of the picture properly exposed even though you are using a flash.  The camera was taking flash pictures at very slow shutter speeds. Sometimes it seemed to take up to a second, and my 2 year old grand daughter who never sits still was always a blur.  This setting is particularly devilish when the area where the flash picture is being taken is evenly lit.  If the \"even lighting\" in the room is low light it will always force the camera to a very low shutter speed.Luckily they do have what I would call a \"normal\" flash setting where the minimum shutter speed is 1/1000th of a second.  I have now set the camera to that setting and it was stopping the fastest of motion!  Now I only have to see if it is fast enough to stop my granddaughter!For those of you who want to know how to set it to the right setting,1) Take the camera out of IA mode, put it in to M, S, A, or P or one of some other specialty modes.2) Then push the \"menu set\" button,3) In the LCD, navigate to the thing that looks like a camera (REC) on the far left side.4) Navigate to the right5) Navigate down to the second page where it says \"Flash\"6) If is shows a downward flash arrow, and S, and an eyeball you are set to take flash pics of people, if not7)Hit the right arrow and pull up a side menu8) Go down until you see the Flash Arrow, an S and an Eyeball9) Hit the \"menu set\" button twice and you are set to take stop-action flash pictures in that mode only.  If you want to set this in other modes it must be done for each mode, and at least as far as I know right now if you are in IA (automatic) mode it will choose for you, and based on my experience with the flash, it chooses badly.", "Date": "December 10, 2013"}, {"Title": "Wonderful camera....just what I expected", "Author": "Diane Guelzow", "ReviewID": "R1Q3M1JNWFPD8T", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "My daughter had this same camera and so I wanted to purchase one for myself.

It's light and has the same feel as a dslr since it has a grip. I was caught between the Olympus e-pl1 and this camera and I believe I made the right choice overall. I tend to use the flash (which the e-pl1 has) and wanted the photographer feel of using a viewfinder(which it doesn't). This and my familiarity with Panasonic's UI won me over. The camera performs great and is of a micro four thirds format which is a great breakthrough for photography. Micro 4/3 is great because I can use any micro four thirds lens on this camera. Meaning this lens mount is universal for any manufacturer willing to jump into this format( so far Panasonic,Olympus, Samsung) unlike nikon, canon etc. The four thirds system was made for freedom. Theirs also adapters you can buy to mount older lenses like Konica's AR, Leica R and Olympus OM mounts which only allow you to manual focus but with this camera it's easy and enjoyable. The live view function is awesome but the viewfinder could be better. Another thing that I'd have changed is the LCD/viewfinder button. They placed it on the left side of the LCD while most control buttons are on the right. In my opinion the playback button should be their instead. Over all though it's a magnificent and inexpensive way of entering serious photography.
