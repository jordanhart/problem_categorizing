I really like this camera, especially being able to take HD video and optically zoom while recording.  I also really like taking 4 fps of continuous shooting.2. You really need to read (at least skim) through the instructions.  Some of the ease of use benefits of a point-and-shoot were compromised to give you some of the versatility of a digital SLR.  I'm not too crazy about the \"Control Dial\" to select menu options.  Over all, the software seems a bit less intuitive than other Powershots I've used in the past.3. Using Quicktime on Windows to view the HD video might result in jerky motion.  HD video is smooth in Quicktime on a Mac.  This is a Quicktime/Windows issue, not a camera problem.4. The camera is solidly built, but it's a bit heavy.  It's not ergonomically designed for extended video recording.5. Consider reading and viewing a video demo by a professional at [...]Long version:I was very eagerly anticipating this camera.  The key feature in the Canon SX1IS is the CMOS sensor used in the SLR product lines.  I got really excited about a single camera with HD video, 20x optical zoom, 4 frames per second of continuous shooting, articulated screen, and standard AA batteries.  I've owned several Canon Powershot models, and I've been very satisfied with them.  I'm also an experienced 35mm SLR person.  I thought that the SX1IS was going to be my perfect camera... or actually the perfect gift for my wife.I am an amateur photographer whose primary subjects are my children playing sports.  Since I work a lot, my wife actually ends up taking a majority of the photos.  I was planning to get a digital SLR for her when I came upon the specs for the SX1IS.  It seems as if Canon product managers have listened to everything I wanted in a digital camera.  The biggest deals for me were  1. HD video with optical zoom enabled while you're filming  2. 4 frames per second of continuous shooting  3. 20x optical zoom  4. Ease of use of a point-and-shootHere are my series of reactions:1. After the first set of photos and videos, I couldn't help but feel as if Canon has under-delivered on the promise of a nearly perfect camera for amateurs or perhaps my camera was defective.  This was my review of the first batch of photos and videos:  (please read on to the next section since my initial disappointment resulted more from ignorance and unfair expectations)  a. I wasn't getting anywhere near 4 frames per second.  b. In the AUTO mode, the photos seem to come out at a lower quality than my much cheaper Powershot A710 in AUTO mode.  By lower quality, I mean that the color, contrast, and details appear not as good.  c. It is very cool to be able to zoom in and out while you are taking video, but the HD video footages came out jerky enough to be really annoying.2. This didn't seem right, so I actually read the instructions and spent a few minutes googling for info.  It quickly became clear that you really have to read the manual to use this camera effectively.  The manual is not written especially well, but it contains the info you need.  (FYI, I've NEVER read instructions on any of my other digital point-and-shoot cameras before, and I have been very happy with the thousands of photos I've taken.)  a. Getting 4 frames per second:  I learned that you cannot shoot 4 frames per second in AUTO mode or SPORTS mode.  SPORTS mode can only take continuous AutoFocus photos which is about 1 frame per second.  Most of the other modes support fast 4 frames per second continuous shooting.  In the 4 fps continuous shooting, only the first shoot will be in focus, the others will be out of focus if the subject moves towards or away from your camera.  b. Comparing photos from SX1IS with A710:  I realized that I was taking photos at high zoom that the Powershot A710 was not even able to get, so this was not a fair comparison.  For apples-to-apples outdoor photos, SX1IS does take superior photos, but indoor photos does seem grainier at similar zoom levels.  However, the difference is really minor, and there are many many adjustments on the SX1IS that can more than compensate.  c. Jerky HD video playback:  This is a really a problem with Quicktime on my Windows Vista (on 2.5GHz Quadcore CPU with 4GB of RAM & ATI Radeon 512MB graphics card, so not a hardware issue).  I saw similar jerky playback with Quicktime on Windows XP.  However, the videos play smooth and perfectly in Quicktime on a Mac OS X.  By reading this review, I hope you don't get upset when your first HD video looks really bad because of the jerky motion.  I'm sure that this is a temporary problem: either Apple will improve Quicktime playback on Windows, a better MOV player will be available, or software will be available to convert the MOV to another format that works better on Windows.  d. Further note:  To make changes to a bunch of settings via the menu options, you have to use this ring on the function button (called the \"Control Dial\").  It's the knurled outermost concentric ring surrounding the FUNC. SET button.  You rotate this to select the menu options you want.  Well, maybe I'll get used to it, but right now, this ring sucks.  It's easy to miss the your menu item because you rotate this ring with just enough force, but if you press a bit too much, you end up with different options.  This will probably suck to another plateau when I'm in bright sunlight looking through the viewfinder.Here are 3 other things you might want to consider before purchasing this camera:1. The camera feels very solid, but this also means that it is a bit heavy.2. The form factor is for taking photographs, so if you plan to use this primarily for the HD video, your hands/arms will tire out.  It is a bit awkward to keep the camera steady for extended video.  HD camcorder will probably be better for you if your primary motivation is to take HD videos.3.

The 20x zoom, HD video, and 4 fps is worth the cost premium.", "Date": "April 30, 2009"}, {"Title": "Great Hybrid Camera/VidCam", "Author": "M. Wallace", "ReviewID": "RUXYSQUPUE0PU", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "There is a lot to love about the Canon PowerShot SX1 IS.  Being able to take photographs or shoot 1080p video (get a big memory card for video!) is the main attraction for this camera, and this camera delivers.  The 20x zoom lens is FANTASTIC.  Zooming in and out is painless, quick, and silent.  You'll love the freedom this gives you.  I love that this camera takes 4 AA batteries.  These kind of batteries are available everywhere so you don't have to worry about running out of power like you do in cameras with a proprietary battery pack.  The video screen on this camera is relatively big, bright, and clear.But the camera is not without a few problems.  Coming from a Canon D-SLR, the image quality leaves a little to be desired.  At 100% magnification, the images are a little noisy.  However, most people don't look at pictures at this zoom-level, and at normal print sizes, the images are sharp and noise is not really noticeable in real-world shooting.  I personally don't like the neck strap.  Maybe I just need to wear it in, but at its current stiffness, it sometimes gets in the way of the camera controls.  The video looks a little wobbly sometimes due to the design of CMOS sensors (Google \"rolling shutter effect\").  However, I only notice it when moving the camera quickly (such as panning).  The battery compartment doesn't open the way you might expect (look in the manual before attempting it).  The on-screen menu is a pretty good but could be better.  The viewfinder is electronic and the colors on it appear washed out, but it gets the job done.  Finally, there are no threads on the front of the lens to mount filters on, but there are third-party adapters that will let you do this (Lensmate makes one).However, I'm still very satisfied with my purchase and would not hesitate to recommend the camera to others looking for this kind of hybrid camera.  I'm going on a trip in June and it'll be the only camera I take.", "Date": "April 22, 2009"}, {"Title": "The Right Tool in The Right Hands", "Author": "BoogieNYC \"BoogieNYC\"", "ReviewID": "R1MJJ6GDBPA8M2", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I've been waiting for the HD-video-capable replacement for the SX10IS for awhile, and I'm glad I waited. There is a lot of legitimate discussion whether this, the successor to the SX10IS, is a worthwhile replacement, and the answer is contingent on what you want to do with a camera and how experienced you are with photography.First, this camera has an incredible zoom range. I stood from several blocks away and photographed an entire seven-story building in NYC using the SX1IS's widest zoom setting. From the distance I stood I could barely see that the top three floors featured terraces. I took another photo at maximum zoom and could not only see the terraces but see with reasonable detail that someone with a yellow short-sleeve shirt was having breakfast on their terrace. Needless to say, if you have a need for a fast, high-zoom-capable lens, the SX1IS has it.In terms of speed, the camera feels very responsive. The lens itself zooms and retracts quickly with little noise (even while shooting video) and I was pleased with the overall responsiveness. The focus settings need to be played with somewhat, but overall the camera feels quick as opposed to sluggish or slow. Also, this (over the SX10IS) is rated at 4fps, which is mighty quick.Picture quality, overall, is very good. There is definitely fringing on the edges of a shot where the barrel effect of a big, zoomed-out lens appears, but overall I'm happy with the results. There are some issues if you are taking a shot that will wind up on the side of a bus in an ad, but even 8x10 shots will come out wonderfully.The camera is a bit heavy, but given the lens and the technology stuffed into this thing, I didn't feel like I needed a massage after working with it for a few hours. It's lots heavier than my snapshot go-to camera, the Canon 880IS, but that's like suggesting a Maybach is a lot heavier than a Kawasaki Ninja. Apples and oranges.Overall, I think this is a good camera. It is a great tool for people who really know what they're doing -- which frankly isn't me. However, I have a general idea of what I want to accomplish and I'm willing -- and going to -- take the time to learn how to get more out of this camera. It's fine as an automatic point and shoot -- a bit complicated, perhaps -- but it will definitely save me the trouble and bother of going the dSLR route. Unless the lens on this camera is damaged, there should be no need to upgrade because the wide angle is great and the zoom is incredible. The lens could be a bit better at high zoom, but I'm satisfied with the results.The main thing that this camera offers over the SX10IS is the capability to do RAW images and HD Video. The former is for serious users -- I haven't installed my packaged Canon software yet and haven't even explored taking RAW images or how to edit them with Photoshop on the PC -- but the HD video results are pretty amazing. I'm not sure how often I'll use this to do HD video but I can say without a doubt that I'd kick myself in six months' time if I wanted to use it to take some video and had to rely on 480p or 720p instead of full HD video. The quality is stunning and accurate, and with stereo mics the SX10IS does better at video than some fully-dedicated video cameras from several years ago.A word to the wise: if you are willing to take the time to learn how to use this camera or are very experienced, you will enjoy using this camera. It's a bit pricey but I think it's a great piece of equipment. If however you are looking at this as an improvement on a little snapshot camera like the aforementioned 880IS and all you want to do is take portraits and the like, don't spend the extra money, get a snapshot digicam.I'd recommend this to people who are either experienced or have a decent knowledge and understanding of photography, and also for people who would like to explore the mechanics of taking a photo beyond just hitting a button. It does produce some great photos, but it can really be frustrating. Bottom line: between the expense, the size of the cam itself and the tweaking necessary, if convenience is first and quality is second on your wishlist, this is not the right camera for you. You should go check out the Canon G10. If quality and the art of photography are the two highest items on your digicam wishlist, buy it and happy shooting.Four stars and not five because of the lens fringe, the manual pop-up flash and the focus issues I originally experienced before I read through the manual. I'd have given this bad boy an extra star for RAW recording but I also deducted a star because you need to install proprietary Canon 'ware (both an app and a codec) before you can manipulate RAW images in Photoshop or elsewhere.Overall, one hell of a camera.", "Date": "June 16, 2009"}, {"Title": "Unfortunately, this is my second return of a canon superzoom compact", "Author": "bino", "ReviewID": "R25G8PGWS5E59", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "Let me preface my review by saying this is the perfect super zoom compact for me (on paper).  I love everything about this camera but its reliability.I've been really pleased with the HD video performance; sharp videos with good out of the camera color rendition, with some CMOS \"wobble\" on fast pans (more a function of bad videography technique however).  Was pleasantly surprised with how still images capture in such an extreme 20x zoom lens.  Is it a little soft at extreme aperatures?  yeah.  Is there chromatic aberation in the corners?  sure.  But this is a compact camera we're talking about here.  ISO 400 is about the limit for me in regards to noise, but this is about par for the course as I've never been happy above 200 in all other compacts i've owned.  The articulating screen is awesome and battery life has not been an issue due to rechargeable AA accesibility.  For a traveller, this is a huge plus.  Those who don't travel may not understand or appreciate this feature.Where this camera fails in epic proportion is durabilty.  My first SX1 lasted 3 weeks before it gave me the following error: \"lens error, restart camera\".  This was after 30 or so pictures, and 4 movies; we're talking about 1 hour of total use, tops.  Camera was never dropped or mishandled.  Upon investigating online and forums, this seems to be an issue with both Japanese and US versions of this camera.Perhaps I am just very, very unfortunate to get this twice.  Getting burned twice makes me shy about trying it one more time and I hope you have better luck than I did.", "Date": "November 26, 2009"}, {"Title": "Best All In One Camera!", "Author": "T. Hallam \"Christian\"", "ReviewID": "R1RO96J3SPHL9W", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I just returned (last night) from a 12 day MIT alumni safari trip in Tanzania.  I've been a serious amateur photographer for 50+ years, and had planned to take my Rebel xsi and two zoom lenses.  I bought the sx1 3 months ago to evaluate it, and after many hours of using it, shooting test shots vs. the xsi, and traveling with it, I decided to take only the sx1 to Tanzania.  Four people in our group had quality DSLRs and big lenses; one had an HD DVR.  I am VERY happy that I chose to take the sx1.  I got many more very good stills and HD videos than any one else.  The DSLR people did get some exceptional stills that are better than anything the sx1 could do, but I knew that would be the case.  My sx1 was always with me, always a second or two away from taking a quick shot, and even mixing stills and HD video simultaneously.  I love that you can zoom while shooting video.  I used Energizer \"ultimate lithium\" non-rechargeable AA batteries.  I got 800 stills and 45 minutes of video on the first set before the \"low battery\" warning.For me, reviews that point out that the sx1 image quality is not quite as good as a DSLR+lens that are 4x bigger and heavier are not helpful.  It is true, and should be obvious.  The big lenses are also better in dim light.  In good light and mid-distance scenes, I can't tell the difference in 8x10 images from my best DSLR and my pocket Canon SD970.I had a choice of taking the sx1 on safari, with a total weight of 1.47 pounds including batteries, or the xsi plus a canon 17-85 and a sigma 50-500 zoom, total weight 7.05 pounds without cases and charger.  The sx1 was more than worth the image quality tradeoff, and the ability to shoot HD video was a real bonus.  I'm fairly new to video, but using PowerDirector I'm integrating stills and video, all 1080 HD quality, into a really attractive presentation.I found that the Tamrac 5230 case was best for the sx1 on safari.  I wore it on my belt, with the top unzipped (it has velcro and snap closures as well as the zipper).  I put the spare batteries, lens cleaner, etc. in a big zip-lock bag and folded that in the bottom of the Tamrac, under the camera.  The Tamrac would fit into the zip-lock bag in a downpour.  I got an adapter (LensMate, I think), and kept a 58mm skylight filter on the lens, with no lens cap.  I could wipe the filter clean quickly without worrying about scratching the lens.  I kept a tiny tripod in the outer pouch of the Tamrac, and I was ready for anything.If you are considering a camera in this size and price range, and you want the 20x zoom and HD video, you will love the sx1.", "Date": "November 17, 2009"}, {"Title": "Waited long for this camera to come to USA, not disappointed.", "Author": "Brian Gouge \"Gadget Freak\"", "ReviewID": "R1KMAI0WMJPRBE", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I've liked Canon cameras for a long time. I went from an SD40 to an SX3IS and then to this SX1IS. I'm not at all disappointed. I think you can and should find more complete reviews on dpreview and cameralabs, which has a good HD video sample. That said, I'm not going to try to post a complete technical review, just my likes/dislikes, pros/cons, and helpful info. If you get nothing else from my whole review, at least try this tip: Stop shooting with your camera set to Auto. You're missing out on features!Where to start? This camera uses 4 AA batteries. I really, really, really like using rechargable AA batteries instead of proprietary LION packs. I have used 2500 mAh Energizers with no problems, but recently switched to Eneloops over worries about self-discharge between charges. Yes, my flash can take longer to recycle as the batteries reach half-way, but it sure beats spending $100 on a couple new LION packs in a couple years. I'd rather carry 4 extra AA's to switch to AND have the ability to use any available AA's (100 shots on alkalines vs over 400 on 2500mAh rechargables) in a pinch. At worst, buying batteries at retail or vacation-spot prices would be upsetting, but a dead LION pack means no pictures period. After using someone's camera that tries to work on 2 AA batteries, ugh, I'd never buy one of those and for small cameras you can't beat quick flash recycle times from LION packs. But with 4 AA's you have all the power you need to shoot just as well as LION packs, at least for the first half of the batteries. If I notice my flash starting to take too long to show ready, and I need to maintain quicker flash shots, I just swap to my spare set and know it's time to recharge the other ones.With my other cameras, I always kept them on P (Program) mode on the dial, but starting with this one I now keep it on C (Custom) because I can store all my favorite settings, including \"continuous shutter without focus\" for very very fast shooting, and have it always come on that way at power-on, ready to hold down the button and bloat my memory card with 8 shots of the same thing for my wife to later complain about as she goes through the pictures :-) The few settings I might mess with frequently like servo focus, I put in the favorites menu, and then have that menu come up first when pushing Menu. Very helpful. I do still twirl the dial around for specific things like Night shot, and if you like the results of Portrait (tries to use aperture to blur the background, keeping the face in focus) by all means use that as needed.After several months now, the only annoyance for me is having to switch between Wide and 4:3 to shoot Video and Pictures. I wish Canon would add an option to \"Always Record Video in HD/Wide\", so when you push the dedicated Record button it always switches to wide, and then back to 4:3 (if that's what it was before) when you stop recording. I bought an SX1 because I wanted to record HD video, right? Otherwise I would have bought an SX10! The best Picture resolution is in 4:3, otherwise you're shooting wide pictures that are \"Cropped\" in pixels compared to full 4:3. I suppose someday all the film places might switch to wide but for now 4x6 is the default picture standard. The 4:3 shots out of the camera are actually 4.5x6 so Costco will happily auto-crop people's heads off for you if you don't process your pictures ahead of time, but my wife is good at that now. Ok, sorry, I'll try to stop reviewing my wife and focus on the camera. I don't use the camera's built in red-eye or other processing it can do, so I can't comment on that.I'm not really unhappy with the noise or ISO. It's certainly no worse than my other Canon's and it is unfair to compare the SX1 with an SLR. Of course you get less noise and higher ISO with an SLR! This is a superzoom, not an SLR. I don't have to carry a huge telephoto lens around with me or switch back and forth to wide angle. As it is, this camera is really pushing the limit on a belt-carry camera. I've never even tried, although I found a case at Walmart that does have a belt clip I still just use the shoulder strap. I could wear my SX3 but just barely... Anyway, if you need to get noise out of a picture, I can't recommend enough that you invest in Neat Image. I notice noise more in desktop backgrounds than prints, but by the same logic I also see the noise more when processing/cropping pictures in preparation for making prints.. Neat Image is very flexible and also has some presets like \"sharpen a strongly out of focus picture\" that can turn a mis-focused \"just throw it away\" shot into a \"well at least you can see something\" print. There is a free version but I use the 32 and 64-bit Photoshop plug-ins so I've paid for those. While that's outside the scope of the camera review, I think the information is helpful to others and so I've mentioned Neat Image.Video... Well with a 16GB card I get an average of 47 minutes in HD, less whatever pictures I take. The video compression will vary depending on the subject, so it's hard to say precisely, but 3 minutes per Gig is a good estimate to go by. I've only had to switch to a standby 8GB card once because the 16GB filled up. You can snap pictures (without flash) while recording video, it just sort of puts a pause-like freeze in the video for a moment though the sound continues to record. The video you get in low light is nowhere near what you can get with a real camcorder. There's no lamp built-in. Turn on lights or plan to supplement by carrying a lamp, or if you go to a school play or something bring a real camcorder. I like not having to carry a second thing around. I stopped carrying my camcorder when I got my SX3, and now HD video is bonus extra-sweet icing on the cake.The face detection doesn't work as often as I hoped it would. It needs larger faces than I tend to shoot in real life, because I don't zoom in on faces so much. If you frame with up to perhaps 3 or 4 people standing close, getting their hair and just below the shoulders, sure it face-detects unless they turn sideways, but it's hard to get it to face detect when taking head-to-toe shots with scenery. When it doesn't find a face, I don't have any problem bracketing a shot with center focusing and then shifting the camera to frame the shot how I want. For that reason, I leave servo focus turned off by default, because otherwise moving the camera to frame a shot can also throw the focus to the background and blur the subjects. I thought Servo Focus would be great for those times when the toddler just won't stop walking towards you while you are waiting to snap a picture, but after ruining a precious shot with the blurring I described from framing the shot, I moved the setting to easily-accessible in the menu and defaulted it to off.If you are used to flashes that automatically pop-up, you might hate this camera. I really started to like the way this flash works when I had my SX3, so I am already used to it. In Program or Custom mode (stop using Auto!), you can set the flash to Always ON when the flash is flipped up. Even at the beach at noon in Summer, I recently took a lot of shots with the flash up. Why? Because the lake was in sunlight but the baby was under the shade canopy playing in the sand. I wanted scenic shots but I wanted to be sure the baby was well lit. With this camera it is hard, but not impossible, to blow-out a subject too white with the flash. It is still good to step back and zoom in to avoid it, rather than step close as your instincts probably tell you to do, but this camera is far better at taking a very quick pre-flash exposure measurement and not blowing out someone's face to near white uselessness the way my SX3 could easily do. Want another tip? Indoor shots including trains, ships, etc, you may want a picture of people but also to see the view out the window. If you point at the people, the window usually comes out mostly just white. Flip up the flash, forcing it to fire. Keeping focus in mind, point so the center is at the edge of the window so it focuses on the distance to the Window (not the outside), press half-way, then move the camera to your people and depress the rest of the way. You should now have a picture exposed that shows the pretty (hopefully) outdoors through the window, but also the flash lights up your people and they appear nicely instead of as dark outlines of their hair.Well anyway, if you need a pocket camera, look elsewhere -- the G10 is a great full-featured camera and much smaller, but \"only\" 5x zoom. If you like carrying more lenses than camera and turn your nose up at low ISO noisy consumer cameras, go buy an SLR and good luck to you -- your chiropractor is probably getting rich off you. If you can carry a camera this big and you need a real 20x zoom (and a real 40x with no fake digital zooming in HD video mode!) with a decent wide-angle as well, you can't go wrong with the SX10IS. But, if you need HD video, then you want the SX1IS. The SX10IS is almost half the price, so the only reason to get the SX1IS is for HD video, and the review sites I first mentioned will explain this far better than I could. Remember the best thing about the SX series cameras is the dedicated Video-Record button. No matter what your dial is set to, one button starts and stops video recording.Update: October 2012. I am still using this camera. Life for our family is such that carrying a camera this large is not often practical, in fact we left it behind entirely when we went to Disney World Orlando and used only our iPhone 4S' and the in-park photographers PhotoPass system. I wish there was a combination of 1. compact, with 2. a large sensor, and 3. a good optical zoom, but nothing currently fits the bill; there are a few 3x zoom choices and one 4x zoom choice, the Canon G1 X 14.3 MP CMOS Digital Camera with 4x Wide-Angle Optical Image Stabilized Zoom Lens Full 1080p HD Video and 3.0-Inch Vari-Angle LCD. A family member has purchased a Sony DSC-RX100 20.2 MP Exmor CMOS Sensor Digital Camera with 3.6x Zoom which has a huge 1\" sensor, and 3.6x zoom. It is pocketable which is a huge difference in having a camera vs leaving it behind, and I am planning to borrow it enough to evaluate whether I need a superzoom or if I can instead just crop images from the RX100 when more \"zoom\" is needed. I fully realize that there is no comparison to a quality lens on a DSLR body, but if the SX1IS is often \"too big\" then a DSLR is completely out now isn't it? My family needs a good Compact camera, not a wedding/sports photographer's kit. I only hope we continue to see more larger sensor and longer zooms in the Compact category.", "Date": "August 5, 2009"}, {"Title": "Great Hybrid Camera for the Traveler that packs light", "Author": "Henry J. Lee", "ReviewID": "R3P4YMKWHVHYEF", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "The Canon SX1 is a great all around camera for advanced amateurs who are willing to sacrifice some quality for the convenience of having a lot of features in one (relatively) small package. It is great for travelers who want to take some quality photographs plus occasional video clips without having to lug a lot of different gadgets plus accessories.Note that while it offers a good balance between the convenience of a point & shoot and the image quality of a DSLR, it's not going to beat either at the things each is specifically good at. Jack of all trades, master of none, but does pretty well if you know its limitations. I have samples of photos and a video using this camera on my website. The address is listed at the end of this review.As with any camera, the major factor in taking good photographs is you and your skills. You'll also benefit from reading the manual. This camera has a lot of advanced photography features normally found on DSLRs that, if you make full use of them, will get you excellent results.What's Good (not in any particular order):1. Wide angle plus 20x zoom without swapping lenses. I hate carrying too much stuff around, which is why I don't use a DSLR. You can shoot landscapes and close ups of wildlife without wasting valuable time to put on the appropriate lens. Plus the weight can really add up when you're backpacking or out on an extended day hike.2. Vari-angle display. Great for taking shots at odd angles like ground level, above your head, over the cliff or self-portraits. I don't think I'll buy another camera without this feature. You will get amazing shots with ease that you can't with other cameras that don't have this feature.3. Can add filters. With a lensmate adapter (google lensmate), you can add a wide variety of filters like a circular polarizer, UV, infrared, neutral density, etc. You can add a lot to the quality of your photographs with filters.4. Does HD video at 1080p. You can get some pretty cool clips from this camera without needing to have a camcorder.5. Has a lot of advanced features: autobracketing for high dynamic range photos, raw and raw + jpeg, exposure compensation, aperture and shutter priority, etc.6. Has a lot of convenience features such as the scene modes for different types of photography you may be doing.7. Hot shoe for external flash. Only way to go for flash photography.8. Can be vastly expanded using CHDK firmware. Not approved by Canon but loading up this firmware allows this camera to do a lot more. For example, long shutter is normally limited to 15 seconds, which doesn't allow you to take night shots very well. With CHDK you can open your shutter for minutes to get amazing night shots of the sky or the skyline. You'll also be able to do time lapse photography, go beyond the 4gb video file limit and much more.9. Uses standard AA batteries. With custom rechargeables you are SOL when you run out of juice. With AA, you can run into any convenience store to get more batteries. On my recent trip to Yosemite I took 4 sets of rechargeables thinking it was more than enough juice for my 5 day trip. Sometimes things don't go according to plan and I was glad this thing takes AAs when I ran out of juice on the 4th day. Would have otherwise missed some very beautiful shots on my last day.So what are the Cons?1. Poor low light shots. Not anything worse that most point and shoots. But don't expect it to be as good as DSLRs. Yes it has a CMOS sensor but it is small. Beyond 200 ISO you're going to see a lot of noise. Having good lighting is crucial for this camera. A tripod will also help immensely.2. Size and weight. Yeah it would be nice if it was the size and weight of my iPhone.

As a high-end point and shoot, it generates pictures better than just about any compact and quite a few older DSLRs, but it is no substitute for even a modern budget DSLR like the Nikon D40 and at high resolution it has noticible noise at all but the slowest ISO settings. Its superfine JPEGs are very sharp, but people who expect full control over RAW will be disappointed at how comparatively little adjustment is possible (white balance, colour, and not much else). If you primarily shoot in 16:9 (as I do), then you will adore the widescreen LCD, but if you primarily shoot in 4:3 then you will find it vibrant but cropped. Video, especially in HD mode, is crystal clear and sharp with exceptional audio but difficult to play on all but very high end systems (PowerPC Macs need not apply) and you will want a big card. Plus, the camera is rather exhausting to hold through long video sessions. However, it is almost as good as my trusty Vixia HV-30.If you're getting the idea that virtually every plus of this camera comes with a corresponding caveat (except for the AA batteries: it uses AA batteries instead of stupid custom charge paks, and it's very powerthrifty, so this is a big plus), you're right. I bought this camera *specifically* for its 16:9 capabilities and the ability to quickly frame widescreen panoramas, which put it in a very small group of cameras, and I do actually make use of its HD video capability from time to time. Thus, for my specific purposes, it performs admirably. People using it for professional print photography, however, will be disappointed by the image noise and the relatively few prosumer features. If you are primarily doing 4:3 or 3:2 images and you don't need (good) video, you would be better served by something else, and for those tasks I still use my Nikon SLR.As a high-end amateur point and shoot, and a professional camera for certain niche uses such as my widescreen requirements, it is an exceptional camera in its class. Just remember to use program mode and ISO 80 for shots requiring high quality, and use a tripod.

I've always had a selection of lenses, filters and other gear. I'd go out on a morning walk or an evening photoshoot and take it all with me.Lately, though, I've begun to travel extensively and frankly, carrying it all around all day takes its toll. So, I started looking for an all-in-one camera. However, I had some must-have requirements.1. It must shoot in RAW mode.2. It must be able to do auto exposure bracketing3. It must have a big focal range, starting with moderate wide angle and moving to a decent optical zoom.4. It needs to be small, light and portable.5. It must have Image Stabilization (Canon's name) or equivalent.I looked at a lot of cameras. I checked out some pancake lens cameras like the Olympus and some really tiny ones like Canon's famous G-series.I wound up with an SX1 IS. Although it is slightly larger than I had hoped, it meets all of my requirements.I've used it for about 3 weeks now, including taking it on a business trip to the Netherlands. I really do like it, though there are a few minor issues.Things I like:1. It is small enough to fit into my briefcase2. It is light enough to carry all day3. The LCD swings away from the body and rotates, so I can hold it down low or above my head and see what I'm shooting without needing a right-angle view finder.It has some surprise features like wide-HD format and video. I'm not sure I'll ever use them but if I do want to experiment, the camera will cooperate. One really nice feature is auto-focus bracketing. This camera will take a series of pictures at slightly different focus points. Photoshop will merge them. I don't usually work in macro mode, but I did experiment with a flower and got three shots, auto-focusing on the front-middle and back then merged them together quite easily. UPDATE: I just got back from a vacation that included a float-on-the-river event. Many of my shots autofocused on the foliage, not the animal hiding within it. I changed to AF Bracketing mode and was delighted with the results. In almost every case, one of the three was targeted on the item of interest. I would have missed several of the trip's best without that feature.There were a few things that took a bit of getting used to. Most digital SLRs have a crop factor of about 1.3 or even 1.5 to one, so a 35mm lens looks like a 50. Given that I carried a large range zoom (28-300) I usually didn't know exactly what focal length I had used when I framed a shot the way I wanted it, so when I saw it in Lightroom at, say, 200, that seemed right.  This camera has a crop factor of about 6:1. At 8mm (which would imply fish-eye) there's no distortion at all because it looks like 35mm. The lens barrel does have marking that show actual vs effective, but I'm still finding it strange to see very low numbers in the EXIF while looking at images that clearly have much longer lens appearances.Coming from a mid-range camera body, I'm used to a continuous shooting mode that's pretty quick. This camera is noticeably slower, so some shooting techniques had to change. Here's an example of what I mean. I took a canal boat cruise in Amsterdam. There was a spot where I knew the boat would pass an intersecting canal and I wanted a right-angle that was taken on the centerline of the intersecting canal.  Normally, I'd set the camera to burst mode and take 6-8 shots over two seconds and one of them would be just about perfect. This camera is much slower. I had to anticipate the motion and then hit the shutter, then wait for it to focus and shoot. I didn't even come close. Perhaps after taking a few thousand more images I'll have better instinct for the timing, but I suspect that this kind of shot is not one I should plan to get very often.Another bit is that the menus are quite deep. They scroll on and on, so getting to a particular feature isn't quick. Fortunately, I'm one to pretty much pick a setting and stick with it, so that isn't a problem for me, but it might be for others.Since the lens is built in, it doesn't have a manual focus ring. Similarly, the controls for changing shutter speed or aperture are on the back of the camera (a rotating ring) rather than on the lens or a wheel near the shutter as on my other camera body. Again, this is something to get used to, not a particularly big problem. A more negative version of this problem is that there are no threads for a polarizer or protective UV filter. I do have a split density filter that I can and do hold up in front of the lens, but sometimes the situation calls for a polarizer or ND4 and I just have to do without it.However, there are two things I particularly don't like, and they're related. This camera eats batteries.(4-AAs)A fully charged set is good for about 120 images. That means I have to go out with a spare set or two and then remember to recharge them. That will be an inconvenience on the next multi-city vacation. I would be happier with a single, slightly larger battery that lasted for twice as long. The other thing is that I use a monopod with a quick-release head. The plate, when screwed in, covers the opening to the battery compartment, so changing batteries requires removing it. Even if I mounted it directly to the monopod, it would still interfere. (I have a small \"gorillapod\" with an attachment head about the size of a US silver dollar. I tried it on and it just clips the edge of the battery cover.)  These are, to me, more than just minor annoyances, and  others might even rate them as more severe than that.Reading other reviews online, I've seen some comments on the quality of the lens or some possible distortion.  If I can figure out how, I'll include two pictures here, one from a canal in Amsterdam, one from Utrecht.  Both were taken as 3-shot RAW files, converted to HDR in Photomatix and slightly color enhanced in Photoshop and Lightroom.  Photomatix had no problem aligning the images (I used a monopod, and of  course the image stabilization helped) and I didn't observe any distortion. I'm perfectly happy with the optics.All in all, I recommend this camera. It is what it promises to be, and it meets all of the criteria I had when making the purchase.", "Date": "November 8, 2009"}, {"Title": "Best multi-function point-and-shoot, perhaps not for beginners", "Author": "Lake Erie Islander", "ReviewID": "R1UIOIWLJXTVFL", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "The review I liked best here was B. Lim's. I'll try not to repeat everything he/she said, because I agree with all of it.I bought this camera as an upgrade to my old Powershot Pro, and it is my \"everyday\" camera compared to my Canon EOS 5D with a motor drive. After about 400 pictures and about a dozen video clips, I find it an almost perfect point-and-shoot, but that was not my first impression. The user interface is a bit awkward at first, but I think that is partly because it is so powerful and there are so many options. A beginner, or someone who does not use the camera regularly, will not find it wonderful. And some of the buttons, especially in the lower right of the back, are too easy to hit by accident.The mandatory features for me for a point-and-shoot are RAW mode, HDR (autobracketing) support, flip screen, video capabilities in addition to still image. While I love the large and excellent flip screen, I find myself using the viewfinder more with this camera than I ever did with the Powershot Pro. I also find myself using manual mode more than the aperture or shutter priority that I used before. Manual mode makes it easier to get a better preview of the real image lighting as well as tonal curve while making small aperture adjustments.A camera with this much power should have the same connector for an external cable shutter release that my 5D does. Canon: hint, hint.My only real disappointment is that the zoom is electronic only. I expected a manual zoom capability as with my old Powershot Pro. The zoom is often too fast for what I want with video. However, the image stabilization at full zoom in is incredibly good. I didn't think that a 560mm shot with a handheld camera would be sharp, but it always is. I am very, very pleased with that. It has allowed me to get some great unexpected shots that I couldn't have gotten with any other camera without a tripod.I have noticed the excessive grain that some users mention at high ISO, but since I hardly ever shoot over ISO 200 that is not a problem. At 80, 100 and 200, detail is excellent.Overall, the camera definitely deserves a 5 star rating unless (a) you are a beginner or (b) you want high details at high ISO speeds.", "Date": "June 19, 2009"}, {"Title": "4 stars for features but not so sure about quality", "Author": "onestopnyc", "ReviewID": "RU1UMFLHOYSH", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Have been playing with this camera for a while, trying different settings, taking pictures of different subjects, shooting HD movies, etc. and here are what I can say;- you really need to know what settings to use, even if you use the AUTO mode you have to make some changes in settings for face detection for example.- you will see noise on certain pictures, I am still trying to figure out that part.- I recommend purchasing a separate flash, the quality is really good with the Speedlite 270- yes the 20x zoom is really good and totally silent (unlike a Lumix camera I tried) so when shooting in HD you won't hear anything.- HD movie is really good as well and it is very convenient to only have one camera to carry.- transfer to mac or pc is effortless and there is no need to convert the movie files, HOWEVER, I am currently unable to read the RAW file on my mac.- the camera is fairly heavy which can be an advantage or disadvantage depending on how you look at it.- quality via HDMI on a high def TV is excellent- love the fact that you can use AA batteries, much easier to deal with if you travel and run out of power.- you can't take pictures in RAW format if shooting in 16x9 format- if recording a movie, 4x3 will be VGA, 16x9 HD, you can't change that.- buttons are well placed- one touch printing is really convenient- the rotating display is great if shooting above a crowd or something close to the ground.- yes you can take pictures while shooting a movie but when I played the movie you can hear the shutter \"sound\" and the picture would freeze briefly (the sound continued).I hope this can help you make a decision, if you are looking for something less expensive, with a great zoom but without HD movie mode, get the Lumix FZ28, it's an awesome camera.", "Date": "June 2, 2009"}, {"Title": "A learning experience, but great results. updated March 8, 2011", "Author": "A Customer", "ReviewID": "R2P7BA9NKCB4BM", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "The Canon SX1-IS is a replacement for an Olympus C-3020 (3.2MP) camera that still works fine, but I wanted more in a camera.  This new category, the mega-zoom point and shoots make for great vacation cameras.  This particular one costs a bit more, but has HD 1080P (16x9) video recording and wow does it look great.  Standard definition (4x3) video is available in several resolutions.When it comes to still photos, I've learned to like the 16x9 format.  It uses fewer megapixels for that image (think of a square, then pull a rectangle out of it... a bit left on top and bottom).  There is a shading option which is nice to compose 4x6 if you plan to print to those dimensions.The camera feels, looks and sounds like an DSLR.  But it's an electronic viewfinder.... very important a buyer knows that.  I'm one of those people who prefer to look through the viewfinder instead of putting the camera at arms length to compose on the rear LCD.  Mostly I use that for photo confirmation, playback or setting menus.  It does come in handy for low or weird angle situations.  Easy to use in daylight conditions.I have taken photos recently I would never have been able to with my old Olympus, super telephoto nature shots, wide angles, night shots, action shots and videos.  Nice flash photography as well, but limited... it has a hot shoe for external flash systems.It's a lot to learn... it's quality built.... it's fun.... I'm happy with my purchase.UPDATE: March 5, 2010I've learned a few things about this camera over time.  Only recently did I use the HD1080p recording for shooting a band performance in a bar.  Lot's of harsh stage lights... that whole thing.  I found it necessary to use Manual Focus (while rolling HD) to keep the lens from breathing focus.  The incredible range of the zoom allowed me to get close ups of the singers, guitars, wide shots of the stage, reaction shots of audience if there was enough light, overall it was a fun experience.  The footage seems really good considering this is a point and shoot.  (Sound recorded was just a scratch track really).  Burning through 8GB SD-HC cards made me realize how much data is recorded in 1080p on this camera.  I use a modified left-hand grip flash bracket to hold the camera.  This frees up the right hand to make adjustments and lets the operator hold camera much more steady.  Some shots of the stage looked like a tripod was used.  The Image Stabilizer lens on this camera is pretty amazing.  Image grain could be considered a problem, but it's the trade off for convenience and price for this camera.  Yes, it would be nice to shoot everything in 80 ASA setting, but you can't always do that.  The grainy look this camera sometimes delivers is not objectionable to me and there are adjustments that can be used in iPhoto or other photo programs to work with images.  The lens range, equal to 28-560mm on a 35mm camera, is the best feature on this camera.  The CMOS chip allows for 4fps still shots and that same chip can provide Standard Def and High Def video capture.  Still enjoying my purchase and still learning.Update: a year later... March 8th, 2011Just to let readers know... I still really like this camera.  Just last week, I learned another function of Review, (checking specific areas of a picture for accurate focus by pressing a few buttons).  I never thought a point and shoot/mega zoom could involve such a huge learning curve.  Recently, I did my best to help a friends figure out their new Leica V-Lux2 camera.  (A Leica badged Panasonic FZ100).  For me, the transition from my Canon to the Leica was fairly easy.  For my friends, it was not.  Knowing the Leica is nearly $900 and has more functions and mega pixels...  it still comes down to a camera that is not easily learned in a few hours, a few days or a few weeks.  I appreciate the Canon SX1IS after using the Leica V-Lux2.  The Canon viewfinder is easier on the eyes, the viewing screen is wider and easier to manipulate, the buttons are in better positions and the use of AA batteries instead of expensive Leica batteries.  ( I think the Panasonic badged camera is fine for the money )BTW... I became frustrated with N.M.H. recharge batteries.  I've gone to Lithium 8X Energizer batteries, that are lighter and very long lasting.  The cost of batteries is minimal to the cost of lost photos.  I gave up on the whole recharge thing... much happier now.Now that Apple iPhoto is capable of working with RAW image files.  I've started shooting with L+RAW.

No. Well, what do you expect from a camera that costs as much as a HD camcorder can. How is it as a camera? Upgrading from a Canon SD870IS (digital Elph), it is brilliant.Pros:High quality flash compared to Elph. Indoor shots are much nicer. The Elph would wash out the colors, whereas this camera provides pictures with nice color indoors.Picture quality and zoom are far superior to small point and shoot cameras. There are some reviews claiming poor picture quality. I did not compare directly to the more expensive SLR cousins, but there are detailed reviews with image comparisons on sites like steves-[...]. They did not notice artifacts and other issues that people are claiming.Parents, you will love the \"sport\" mode. There is no focus time when you are outdoors. If you see a shot you like, then you can just snap it right away. The pictures look great (as long as you have plenty of light). There is another mode where you can focus on a person and as the person moves it will track the focus of the individual. This mode is nice for following your busy child around too, but it's a bit tedious when there are multiple kids around and you have to tell the camera which face to track.AA batteries: Get high quality rechargeable batteries and you will be satisfied (e.g. Sanyo Eneloop). No worrying about having to charge proprietary batteries.Cons:Video quality suffers indoors. The big problem is the video loses focus frequently when the lighting is not bright. Under conditions where a normal camcorder would be fine, the focus can fade in and out of the subject. I miss having an add-on light to increase lighting. I use a headlamp when indoors to compensate.Outdoors, the video works much better. It won't replace an HD camcorder, but you can still get some nice clips.Overall, the camera takes brilliant photos and the video is a nice option to have, especially outdoors where it is reliable.", "Date": "January 12, 2010"}, {"Title": "Finally Found the Camera I wanted", "Author": "Charles D.

The threads you see in the front of the lens look and smell like 52mm, but they are not cut as threads, they are concentric rings. For some reason, you need a bayonet type mount adapter to run a filter in front. I always mount a UV (clear glass) in front to protect the lens itself. I also bought a 52>62mm step-up ring and a 62mm UV.

Very few camcorders can do 1080P, but this camera does it, and does it pretty well. Movies are stable and look good, although a little jerky at times. The dedicated movie button is cool too.Rapid shooting: 5 frames per second at full res is pretty amazing - this is DSLR territory.LCD screen: the size and clarity are awesome, and the articulating feature is a must have for me. It would be perfect if not for the polarizing - see below.Build quality: This is the most solid camera of this type that I've used. DSLR like.The bad:Picture quality: Canon went with a CMOS sensor to increase the speed, and it is fast, but the picture quality suffers. It is still pretty good, but pictures from the old trusty S5 are better - less noise, crisper, more detailed.Controls: Canon went from increment buttons on the S5 to a thumb dial on the SX1. This is used to change ISO, shutter speed, aperture and other settings I regularly access. The dial is just fussy and hard to use.Lens: Here I am comparing it with an S5 with a 1.8X teleconverter, achieving similar magnification. The the S5 images are better in every way, clearer with less distortion and fringing.LCD screen: Great screen BUT, and this is a big one for me... it is polarized the wrong way! Arg. The S5 screen is polarized such that when wearing polarized sunglasses, you can clearly see the screen in landscape position. The SX1 screen is polarized 90 degrees off from the S5. In other words when looking at he screen in landscape position, it is totally black with polarized sunglasses. This is a big one for me, since I love polarized glasses, and like to be able to shoot without taking them off.HD aspect ratio. You have to switch the camera from 4:3 to 16:9 to shoot HD video. Kind of a hassle switching back and fourth when shooting video & photos.So I am using the SX1 mostly because of the HD feature.

I am very impressed with the HD video quality, and now I feel like I can have the best of both worlds in still and video; although, my main purpose for the camera are still images.  Some may not like the use of AA batteries, but I have found this to be very convenient.  The most impressive feature of the camera for me is the 20X zoom that can key in on distant subjects without the need to fiddle with changing lenses.  I also like the ability of the camera to capture moving subjects with ease.  I have more to learn about this camera, but I wanted to chime in with a review that may be helpful for someone like me that was having a difficult time making a decision on a high end digital camera.

After taking several hundred images I found the still image quality to be unimpressive (or about average).It was when I switched it to video mode that I was blown away.

I bought this camera to \"upgrade\" from my old SI-5 (the previous model to this one) and transitioning to the controls and ease of use was immediate.The camera comes packed with features that make is sound like a good idea to buy: 20\u00d7 zoom, included lens hood, swiveling LCD display, 1080p video, etc. And these features sound good, but fail to deliver due to the poor image quality of the pictures.In terms of portability, it is not. It's bulky, but comfortable to use.The video quality is average, but do you really need 1080p on a point and shoot?The battery life is as good as the AA batteries you buy.The cons that break the deal: Picture quality.I tested this camera as soon as I got it out of the box by taking it to a kids party. I also took indoor picture during the day, and at night (with and without flash). I took pictures using automatic settings, and manual settings. I took pictures in macro focus and in extreme zoom. And the common denominator to all of these pictures was: poor image quality.The camera produces very grainy pictures, unless you are in direct daylight. Even then, the images have a very strange \"blurriness\" when you look at them in 1:1 ratio in your monitor. I couldn't believe I had spent so much money to upgrade my camera and discover the images are worse! So I tested the SI-5 and this camera side by side and decided that the image quality was, in fact, worse.I returned this product 2 weeks after I bought it because it would not deliver the pictures I expected from it.My expectation was set on the previous model (the SI-5) that was a FANTASTIC model.After I returned this product I bought a G11. The G11 is a top-notch point and shoot camera. Worthy replacement for the SI-5, except for one major flaw: the viewfinder of the G11 is a piece of trash, optical, not through-the-lens viewfinder.

I would love to say that the problems are me and not the camera but I think we're about even.I thought this would be a good compromise between what I wanted and what I could afford when the lens covers started sticking on my Powershot A650 and on my husband's handy dandy A720 IS but it wasn't. I replaced his camera with another A720 because the lens cover fell apart suddenly. And, yes, I still battle with the A650 sticking lens cover, often bringing out the A650 rather than suffering the somewhat fuzzy results with the SX1 IS. This is not CMOS at its best.If I need a camera quickly I grab the A720. I get the SX1 IS if I want to take photos of the dogs racing around to the back of the yard when they have company. But then I don't not get the video results I want - for that I need my now unreliable A650.I never made a graceful adjustment from 35mm to digital but the fact is, it doesn't matter when now I'm taking pics of the cats and dogs. However, with one camera-shy cat and one camera-shy dog, I need to be able to capture the image quickly - not as easy with this camera. Our other dog and cat love the camera; so there are plenty of good photos of them, no matter which camera I use. This camera is also not as fun in low light as my earlier Canons. (I could convince my old A95 to take anything...before it purpled out. R.I.P.)I don't like the fact that I must close the LCD screen door to use the viewfinder - what an inconvenience. Who knows when the sun just won't permit quick use of the LCD screen or the dogs running require the screen.I'm not a photographer, I's just someone who likes to take shots of brick walls. junk trucks, industrial flats, mushrooms, sunsets, fall days and animals playing. And some of those photos are darn good. This camera just doesn't provide the fun.Still, I know I'm not doing it justice and I have to make friends with it because until it falls victim to one of the Canon issues such as a purple screen or a sticking lens cover, we're going to be together for awhile.It was a mistake to downgrade from 12mp to 10mp both by Canon and by me.

Ishizue \"Tom\"", "ReviewID": "R2C7FZ6SWN4Z9B", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I have owned this camera for over 2 years now and I still can't get over the main strengths of this camera - the 1080P HD video and high-end audio quality. Since that time, I have tried numerous point and shoot cameras, as well as dedicated camcorders, for the primary use of recording HD video. To this date, I have still not found a camera that has surpassed the Canon SX1 IS in terms of both video (in good light) and audio quality (especially recording bass at concert-level volumes). This includes digital cameras such as the Panasonic DMC-TS3, Sony DSC-TX10 and the DSC-HX9V, and even the high-end Canon HV30 and HF G10 camcorders. The overall quality of the video and audio captures are so good that you forget that this is primarily a stills camera than a camcorder. I have never been impressed with either AVCHD or mp4 formats when compared to the less-compressed .mov format that this camera uses. The quality even exceeds that of my tape-based HV30, which is a feat in itself considering that this has been a reference-level camcorder for consumers. I think Canon primarily designed this camera to be used as an HD camcorder, considering that the fully-articulating LCD display is natively 16:9 aspect ratio like many HD camcorders. However, the big negatives about this camera that I've experienced over the years are its short battery life (uses 4-AA's) and its relatively heavy weight and large non-pocketable size (size does matter, especially for heavy traveling). I have tried to overcome the short battery life issue using high-capacity (up to 3000 mAH) rechargeable AA batteries, but still falls way short of a good high-capacity lithium battery. The other negative is its performance in low light compared to the newer cameras that I've used. I have tried to find a smaller and lighter replacement for this camera that improves upon these weaknesses, but I still have not found any to date that are equal or better than the strengths of the SX1 IS. One more thing about the audio - it's so good that when I play footage back on my high-end Yamaha home theater system using Definitive Technology tower speakers, it feels as if you really are there. No other camera that I've tried has been able to accomplish this to the same level of sonic accuracy. The built-in stereo mic's are so good that they rival some of the best external consumer microphones (I also own the Rode VideoMic for my camcorders). I suspect that the reason why dedicated HD camcorders today do not use the .mov format and use the highly compressed AVCHD and mp4 is to save on memory usage and battery consumption at the expense of image and sound quality. This camera records audio with uncompressed linear PCM stereo which is non-existent in the current crop of consumer camcorders (as of 2/2012). I have given many negative reviews on them because it appears that none of the consumer camcorder manufacturers (including Canon) seem to put any emphasis on sound quality as well as the SX1 IS did. When I spent over $1500 on the Canon HF G10, I never expected the audio to sound so poor in comparison with the SX1 IS. This has become a reference camera since that time. In addition, being able to record in full 1080P at 30 fps that is not available in the 1080P, 24 fps Canon SX40, is a definite plus. I still think this camera is the most underrated and best kept secret that Canon has ever manufactured, especially at the consumer level when it comes to outstanding audio reproduction. No need to even have a dedicated PCM recorder to record outstanding audio.

It's comfortable to hold. The video quality at 1080p is fantastic in good light. It really is as good as many HD camcorders I've owned in the past (I'm a gadget freak, I've had a few.) The sound quality is excellent. With rechargeable AA batteries, the battery life is very good. The zoom range is excellent.The bad. Where do I start?First off, for a digital still camera - it takes poor stills. Noisy and soft. At the telephoto end of the zoom it's even worse. It amazes me that many people are happy with the picture quality of this camera, because it's the least impressive digital camera I've owned.Take the lights down and it gets even worse. There is a great deal of grain and noise in low light shots, even with ISO set as low as possible.You can only take HD videos when the still picture aspect ratio is set to 16:9. A bit annoying if you want to take stills using the most megapixels and switch seamlessly to video.The zoom rocker feels nice but has only one speed.The movie record button is a bit awkward to reach for me. I don't have a 7 inch long thumb, sadly.Movie mode ignores settings in P, A, S or M modes. Your carefully composed backlit composition will go all dark as soon as you press the movie button.The only control available in movie mode is exposure compensation.Manual focus is a complete pain and is pretty much impossible in video mode. This is because the small dial on the back of the camera requires many, many turns to go from one end of the focus range to the other. If you are manual focussing during video, you'll miss the shot before you can get even close.The EVF is horrible. It is of such low resolution that it's useful only as a framing guide when the light is so bright that you can't see the LCD. It's useless for manual focussing or judging exposure.I've been trying to sell my SX1 for the past 6 months, with no luck. I've decided to keep it as a camcorder, as it's strengths are as a video device rather than as a still camera.All in all, not a complete write-off, but disappointing considering the brand.", "Date": "March 21, 2011"}, {"Title": "digital camera", "Author": "J.

Make sure that if you buy one of these amazing cameras, that you purchase a Class 6 memory card. The video quality is 1080p and requires a Class 6 or higher memory card, preferably the new 16gb to 32gb that are now available. Three of our friends recently purchased the Canon SX1 including the one I am reviewing here and I have not heard a single complaint.

Unfortunately, it doesn't appear that a fix will be forthcoming, and so my SX1IS is unused right now, and going to end up on an auction site.I bought it for 2 reasons: quality and zoom. As far as I can tell, I'm not able to get either of those. The quality of the shots (mostly done in \"automatic\" mode) are just plain terrible with noise I'd associate with a call phone camera, not a $600 one. Most shots I take, whether or not I'm using flash, are unusable. The auto-focus is VERY slow too, when it works - 4 or 5 seconds for it to finally report a good focus is unacceptable.As far as zoom is concerned: yes, it's 20x zoom. But the only way to get a good quality shot at even close to this range is to fiddle with the manual focus controls, which are very poorly handled via a very touchy jog wheel.For what it's worth, I am also comparing this camera's quality and performance to a 3-year-old Sony with 10 megapixels but a much lower zoom level. My wife and I had planned on giving the Sony to a family member for their use, but that plan has changed. I get consistently good quality pictures from the Sony, and can live without a high zoom level for now.I had very high hopes for the SX1IS, having had great luck with Canon products in the past.

We decided on the Canon SX1 IS due to the reviews here. Let me tell you how bad this camera is;1. The PQ is horrid. One of our CAMERA PHONES produces nearly identical PQ. Only slightly worse. I called Canon and after talking to the nice person on the phone, they had no explanation. They suggested I email images to one of their higher up techs. Two days later, no response. Update: A week later I called and asked about the pictures, what they thought of them. They said they did not get them. I emailed again to the person on the phone and she did get them while I was on the phone and said they were typical photos for the camera. If that's typical, I have to say Canon has very low standards for this camera.2. The buttons are in all the wrong places. You cannot carry or handle this camera w/o hitting buttons unintentionally.3. This camera weights 1.5 pounds. That's about equal to 2 12oz cans of soda. Go pick up two cans of soda and try to carry that around like you would a camera.4. There is only one way to grip this camera and it requires 2 hands. There is no other way to use it successfully.5. It only comes with standard rca cables to view the HD video. Which, is just horrible. Who in their right mind would put a standard cable with a HD camera?6. The SD card is very, very hard to get out.7. The HD movies will not play on my computer. [UPDATE: We had to update to QT 7 to get them to play. Which does work. However, the video is jerky and jumpy. About every 1 second it seems to skip several frames. The PQ just just good, on the very low level of HD expected quality.]I know I'm being overally dramatic, but it's hard to keep it cool considering this is a $500+ \"HD\" camera. I do LOVE the wide field of view, it's awesome. The 20x zoom is outstanding... in theory. the problem is, both are worthless if the PQ is not any better than a camera phone.
