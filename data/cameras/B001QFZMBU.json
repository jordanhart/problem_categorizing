{"Reviews": [{"Title": "First digital camera I've really loved.", "Author": "Kevin M. Powell", "ReviewID": "R2YREFMK98995R", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I've had quite a number `point and shoot' digital cameras over the past decade-it seems I replace them about every three years. As a believer in the maxim, the best camera is the one you have with you, they have all been Canon Elphs  But this time...I wanted more.  One of the new compact designs with a big optical zoom, plus the wide angle lens. So it was natural that I picked out a Canon PowerShot SX200IS for an for a birthday trip to Italy.  Glad I checked it out prior to departure - its form factor didn't really work for me ...A friend suggested the Lumix ZS1, which just happened to be on sale for $229 at Costco - a hundred dollars less than the Canon.And I am so glad I made the exchange! The Lumix ZS1 delivers beyond all expectation.  There was a point on the trip where I had a vision - imagine (if you go back to the 70's as I do) having an entire photographers bag - say a Nikon F, with a kit of Nikor lens say a 24mm perspective control, 50mm macro, a couple of zooms, multiple camera backs, the flash, the motor drive- in a package that fits in your shirt pocket.  The last camera that blew me away like this was the Olympus XA (old school 35mm) which delivered amazing optics in a shirt pocket size.Cutting to the chase:Pros:Unbelievable Leica lens. You can't imagine what a difference there is between 25 mm and 28 mm at the wide end.  Imagine taking pictures of building facades and interiors as your eye sees them - and without distortion - extraordinary, and worth the decision to go with this camera alone.  Even better - this lens works at all levels.  This is by far the best the macro I've seen on a point and shoot, and the lens is solid all the way to 300mm equivalent - and yes, the image stabilization does really help - in old school terms, think light weight tripod with a very heavy long lensUnbelievable Panasonic electronics. This has a very simple, yet incredibly rich feature set, all of which is useful, all of which delivers great, real world pictures, with as much real world manual control as you could want. For example - you can set the max ISO -which really gives you control over the F stop (since like most compact cameras there really isn't that much of a range) and shutter speed, there is a very convenient toggle button on the camera body to increase/decrease exposure (+/- 2 f stops), and the IA (Intelligent Auto) is the best auto setting I have ever worked with.  You do have to read the manual, however, and play with the multiple settings to fully realize what Panasonic has delivered.Great sensor.  Images are very sharp below 400 ISO as others have noted.  But ultra low light performance, is what is truly amazing.  Think: extraordinary rendition of Giotto's frescos at the Basilica of St. Francis, tapestries at the Vatican, even the Sistene Chapel ceiling - settings where flash will not help or is not permitted - These demanded ISOs of up to 3200 - and the results look truly amazing - when printed, when projected.Great build quality and ergonomic design.  Part of what caused me to return the Canon - it simply didn't fit in my hand well, and the control layout was awkward.  This one fits perfectly in the hand, and every control both on the body and in the menus is well placed, well conceived.  And it not only feels solid, it looks solid, and that is comforting.Cons (yes there are a few, but they are few)The view finder is bright enough in many situations (be sure to turn on the `auto mode').  But there is no substitute for an optical viewfinder in a bright outdoor setting.Proprietary download cable.  Why not use universal mini-USB to USB like Canon does?Average battery life.  All that zooming of the lens barrel and digital wizardry means that this needs to be charged dailyNo HD video.  I find the widescreen VGA mode delivers very acceptable performance - and because it works with the optical zoom, actually looks sharper than the Canon HD at any zoom setting (Canon is digital zoom). But I think the ZS3's HD video will be even more awesome, and probably will end up being available for the same price point.", "Date": "July 8, 2009"}, {"Title": "Amazing stuff in a small package", "Author": "Alexander Don-Doncow \"Critical Al\"", "ReviewID": "R14FFUQWVZ9WNC", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Panasonic finally delivers on the noise end of things.This is the first Lumix prosumer camera that I have seen where image noise is not a serious issue.In fact, just prior to purchasing this camera I had to return a Lumix DMC-FX35K, which I found totally unacceptable in terms of image quality (see my other review).This camera boasts a clean picture with properly controlled noise (very little smudging), it can produce a usable and very printable image up to 800 ISO. Images at 400 ISO are surprisingly good (for this kind of camera).Awesome optics,from a very wide angle to a medium long telephoto, little distortion, no observed vignetting, very acceptable chromatic aberration, a veritable photographic powerhouse in your shirt pocket!Exposure, good if only a bit on the overexposed end (to my taste).All kinds of automation, too much to cover here.Two types of optical stabilization, which on the whole a care little about, in my opinion the technology is far overrated (applies to all brands). You want tack sharp pictures in very low light, lean the camera against a wall a tree or a railing or mount it on a tripod, bean bag or just set it on a table.Very good macro capabilities.Shortcomings, mainly two: 1 - very limited manual controls (that kept me from giving it 5 stars)This limitation precludes its usability as a serious photographic tool (pity!). Albeit, it can still take some tremendous pictures but at the mercy of its automation. 2-  Absolutely terrible Auto White Balance under artificial light, especially the new compact fluorescents. Compensates a bit with an easy to use manual control but that is effective in skilled hands only. Panasonic better come up with a firmware update addressing this issue soon ,else they might start seeing a lot of returns.In summary, a very flexible, well built and powerful camera squarely aimed at the traveler or occasional photo enthusiast.The camera does have the potential to take breath taking images, but it is definitely not a photographers tool; although, given its price, size and sturdiness might work well as a \"just in case\" gadget for those \"ouch\" moments when your main camera is not available.A curious observation:this camera is endowed with a fabulous lens and an almost interminable list of scene modes and other automatic feature, yet it omits simple aperture priority and shutter priority modes which would have probably placed it in a class by itself. As I said before, what a pity!", "Date": "July 6, 2009"}, {"Title": "Great travel camera", "Author": "Pamela Van Cleave \"pamsrollz\"", "ReviewID": "RNB9D62PLYY4", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I've just returned from my first vacation with this camera. I previously had a Kodak subcompact.  Weight and size are good, still easy enough to carry in a purse or pocket. The wide angle takes a huge sweep of area in the photos.  Pictures are crystal clear with a touch of roundness at the edges of the landscapes.  The zoom is incredible, but it takes a special touch getting used to the sensitivity of the zoom dial. The zoom was my main reason for selecting this little camera, along with the fine Leica lens.  I used the manual and IA settings, great shots both ways.  Very good photos in low light and with the flash off.  Huge screen for viewing your subject, but I do miss my old viewfinder. Easy to playback shots and review, as well as a quick upload.  Included software is very good for editing, etc.  I still have a lot of experimenting to do, the camera has tons of interesting feaures. Have not seen a downside as of yet, easy to use, battery life is quite good, I shot for most of the day before it wore down, and it fully recharges in a couple of hours. Highly recommend this camera for the travel buff that loves to take pictures.", "Date": "June 25, 2009"}, {"Title": "A $3,500 lens...Costing Around $250", "Author": "Alan  Houston", "ReviewID": "R3M9YAGPFGZM6C", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Leica is famous for the quality of their lens designs.  A 24mm super-wide angle lens provides a MUCH greater field of view than the more common 35mm wide angle lens.  That makes it possible to take interior photos that show a large portion of a room, or to take architectural photos of entire buildings, even in tightly packed urban areas.BUT, Leica's famous 24mm super-wide angle lens costs about $3,500.  Now Leica has designed a 25mm to 300mm zoom lens for the Panasonic ZS1 and ZS3 which has even LESS visible distortion (bowing of straight lines, such as doors and window frames) and vignetting (darkening of the photo's corners) than does Leica's famous 24mm lens.  So, the owner of an LS series Panasonic gets the photo quality of a $3,500 lens for less than $250.The Panasonic DMC-ZS1 and ZS3 share a superb Leica-designed zoom that provides outstanding performance from the super-wide 25mm range, through to the 50mm  \"normal\" range waaay up to very long telephoto zoom of 300mm...and the lens provides excellent color and contrast in every part of that very long range.There are NO zoom lenses or digital cameras available at ANY price level that will outperform the Panasonic ZS series for ultra-low distortion, rich colors and excellent contrast throughout the entire ultra-wide 25mm to 300mm long telephoto range of the ZS cameras.The Panasonic ZS series cameras are designed to be easy to use.  Putting them in the \"intelligent auto\" mode enables the camera to make all of the decisions.  You simply zoom in on your subject, press the shutter very slightly to pre-focus, wait a second to see the focus confirmation \"dot\", then press the shutter to take your photo.The camera will automatically switch to the \"macro\" mode if you are taking a photo of something a few inches from your lens, it will recognize a person's face and switch to the \"portrait\" mode for natural skin tones, and it re-adjusts the ISO level and shutter speed to match the lighting conditions for each photo.Outdoors, the \"intelligent auto\" mode delivers consistently fine photos with natural color tones and contrast.  The photos are \"sharp\" due to Panasonic's auto stabilization mode, which makes it possible to get hand-held photos that are tack sharp, even at the full telephoto range of 300mm.WARNING: Flash photos tend to be mediocre, unless you are VERY careful. Indoors, when using flash, the \"intelligent auto\" mode works well ONLY with subjects that are very close...about three feet to six feet from the camera.  Beyond six feet, many flash photos will be darker than most people would prefer.  The solution is to switch to the manual mode, and select a higher ISO of 200 or 400.  These cameras have a tiny flash, and good results require getting close, and the results are best in a well lighted room.  This camera is a \"five star\" camera outdoors in bright sun light, but is closer to being a \"three star\" camera indoors with flash.In the manual mode, users can select from many \"scene\" options, including a \"night mode\" that takes beautiful time exposures in dim lighting.  I took some \"night mode\" shots in a dark coffee shop without flash that perfectly recreate the mood of the dimly lighted room.  Also, in the manual mode, users can set the maximum ISO they want to use, and set the minimum shutter speed they prefer.  So, for a sports photo, you can chose to use ONLY shutter speeds of 1/250 of a second or faster to \"freeze\" the action.  Or, you can switch to the \"sports\" mode, and the camera will select a fast shutter speed, and lock the focus to keep subjects beyond about 16 feet away in sharp focus.The manual options give users dozens of ways to tailor their photos, including ways of fine-tuning the color balance.  The instruction book uses 140 pages to detail all of the options for every type of photo.  It is worth an owner's time to work page by page through the entire 140 pages to learn everything this camera can do.But, MOST people will be happy to simply put the camera in \"intelligent auto\" mode and let the camera make all of the decisions.  With just a hour or two of practice, anyone should be able to obtain fine photos consistently.Digital \"noise\" is always an issue with pocket sized compact digital cameras.  However, with the ZS1, the digital \"noise\" is well controlled.  In an 8 x 10 inch enlargement, it would take a very keen eye to see any \"noise\" in the ISO 80 to ISO 200 range.  At ISO 400, a small amount of noise be visible in an 8 x 10 enlargement, but only if you are looking for it.For people who are \"fanatics\" about reducing digital \"noise\" to a minimum, the ZS1 enables you to select an \"auto\" mode that has a \"locks\" the ISO setting to the ISO 80 to ISO 400 range, or you can \"lock\" the ISO at your choice of ISO 80, ISO 100, or ISO 200. On a bright sunny day, locking exposure to ISO 80 produces photos that can match those made with a $3,000 pro DSLR camera.The battery will last about 300 photos without using the flash, and about 200 photos if you use the flash for about half your photos.  The more time you spend  reviewing, editing, and deleting photos, the fewer photos that can be taken. A \"battery gauge\" tells you the amount of power remaining in the battery so you know when to recharge.  The battery recharges in about two hours or less.WARNING:  The size and shape of the ZS1 make it a VERY easy camera to drop.  It would be wise to ALWAYS wrap its strap around your wrist BEFORE removing the camera out of its case. The ZS1 will fit into a jacket pocket, but it would be much better protected in a padded case.  A camera as nice as the ZS1 deserves being treated as the fine piece of equipment that it is, and keeping it in a padded case is an inexpensive way to protect your investment.", "Date": "August 1, 2009"}, {"Title": "Lars", "Author": "L.

So, when the time came for upgrading my camera, Panasonic was on the top of my list of manufacturers.My specifications were :I wanted atleast 10x optical zoom.A P&S; type form factor, which would be easy to carry around.7 - 10 megapixel resolution.A CIPA rating of atleast 300 photos per fully charged battery.I Googled around and checked out various websites, shortlisting 5 models, ranging from a Sony, a Samsung, a Canon & 2 models from Panasonic - the ZS1 & the ZS3.After a final elimination round, I was left with only the ZS1 & the ZS3. Considering the fact that both featured 12x optical zoom, 10 megapixel resolution, 300+ pics per charge, they exceeded my specs. Some additional sweeteners were that the ZS1 & ZS3 come with 25mm wide angle lens! Sites like [...] too had some very good reviews of both the cameras, so I just had to choose between the two.When I placed the order in early May 09, there was a $100+ difference between the two models. The main differences were that the ZS3 can record High-definition video clips with stereo sound + there are a few other features that are missing from the ZS1.Though I was very tempted to buy the ZS3, I decided to go with the ZS1 and invest the money saved in buying an extra battery + a high capacity SDHC memory card. The rest of the process was very smooth & easy.- Checked the prices of the ZS1 on a couple of websites and Amazon had the best deals, with free shipping too. So placed an order.- Placed an order for an extra battery pack + SDHC card.Everything was delivered without a hitch and after a quick glance through the user manual, I was ready to start clicking... and I have been clicking away since the past 3 months.The main pros & cons of the ZS1 are:- Very good optical zoom (12x) & great wide-angle lens (25mm)- iA (Intelligent Auto) mode is really effective in getting great results.- Battery life is quite good.- Image stabilization is more effective than most models I have used.- Very handy and easy to use!Now the cons:- Autofocus works good, but a manual over-ride would have been really great.- Performance of the camera in low-light conditions is just average.- At higher ISO levels (Above 400), there is a significant amount of noise in the photos in low light conditions.- The mode selector dial is a little vague and easily moves out of position.But then, everything cannot be perfect, can it? and these cons are something that I can easily live with.The bottom line is that at this price point, the ZS1 is a great camera for the casual users, active travellers and anyone who needs a easy to use wide angle camera, with good zoom. I would recommend it without any reservations!Products I ordered:Panasonic Lumix DMC-ZS1 10MP Digital Camera with 12x Wide Angle MEGA Optical Image Stabilized Zoom and 2.7 inch LCD (Silver)Panasonic DMW BCG10 Battery pack (The camera will not work with any other non-panasonic batteries)A Transcend Class-6 SDHC 8GB memory card.", "Date": "August 29, 2009"}, {"Title": "Can't find a difference between 5 and 10 MP settings", "Author": "Scott Roberts", "ReviewID": "R17MA8JSP5V8RX", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "First the pros:Great zoom and great in low light.  It will be difficult to find situations where you need the flash.  Only the competing Sony can beat it on sharpness during zoom, but that may be because the wide angle lens penalizes the ZS1 on sharpness. Video is VGA/WVGA which I prefer because I only need it for internet video.  I can't imagine the amount of PC time required to transfer, edit, and upload HD. Macro is as good as they get.The \"fair\" attributes, adequate compared to other cameras:LCD size at 2.7 is adequate, but not large as the other reviewer stated.  The smaller screen is not nice, but it helps save battery life.  Without the flash on the automatic setting, color and everything else seems great. My own settings can hardly ever do better.  Lighting is strong unlike the reviewer's comment, but the wide angle makes it difficult to get even lighting in such a wide field.  Backing up and zooming to look more like a regular camera (to decrease the field of view) enables the flash to be more consistent, maybe more consistent than others since you are further away.  If you don't back up and zoom, expect more shadows from the flash because it's too far to the side of the lens, especially on the sides of the wide field.  If the flash were above the lens, the shadows would be beneath the subject and therefore much less noticeable and more natural. But again, low light ability is so good, I do not expect to ever use flash.  I value even and natural light more than the extra sharpness that the flash provides. Operation seems as sensible, good, and fast, about like the others I've tried.  It's \"complicated\" without the automatic setting like all the others, and just as easy and accurate as the other on the automatic settings.  Anti-jitter allows going from 1/60th or 1/30th to 1/8th shutter speed, which is a great improvement for all cameras that have it, despite the comment from the other reviewer about this feature being over rated.Cons:Those who are used to regular digital cameras may not the wide angle which causes a \"fish-eye\" effect.  For example, if you're doing family or people shots, you will need to be a little closer or use the zoom.  On the other hand, the wide angle is preferable in some instances.  For the higher-end user, the wider angle will allow shots other cameras can't get (there's no \"reverse zoom\" on regular cameras).  Microphone is on top instead of in front which causes more echo from ceiling in rooms, the person recording to sound too loud, and many people will be placing their left index finger over the mic.Video:Wide angle is much nicer for video than pictures. Zoom is painfully slow during video, which is intentional because most people zoom too much in videos.  But it does not begin zooming right away and is too slow.  This is my only complaint about video.  As with many cameras, videos are stored as Quicktime .mov files. Editing beginning and end of video on camera is not possible which would have been nice.  Memory usage is 1.2 MB/second so 16 GB class 6 SD card will store 3.8 hours.  For internet usage, I've found converting to .avi with Indio 85% compression was resulted in files 5 times smaller. You must convert from .mov to .avi using one of several free tools online in order for a Windows machine to edit it.10 MP not better than 5 MP:My biggest complaint is that there is no difference between 5 MP and 10 MP settings.  Regular pictures, zoomed in shots, and macro all appeared to be identical quality under 5 MP and 10 MP settings even when letting the timer prevent blur. Selecting 5 MP standard compression compared to 10 MP fine compression resulted in files 4 times smaller with no change in quality under any conditions when blowing the shots up to look at the details.  The smaller files are much less likely to hang your computer up when editing and viewing thumbnails.Maybe the 10 MP is used to get better digital zoom.  This situation may exist with all 5 MP+ cameras.  All this is not relevant to the typical user who is only using pictures for the computer, in which case 2 MP is plenty.Most MP settings are disabled in auto mode:Sadly standard compression is disabled in automatic mode so 80% of users will be stuck with files twice as big as necessary.  My favorite 2 MP is not allowed. I have to use 3 MP. Combined with disabling the standard storage, all my files therefore have to be 3 times bigger than any computer work needs if you use automatic settings.  A typical computer screen is less than 1 MP, so it seems insane that so many cameras (like this one) do not allow 1 MP pictures.  Since this camera is not improved with anything above 5 MP, you basically have only 3  settings in automatic mode: 3 MP (4:3), 5 MP (4:3), and 2 MP (16:9), with forced fine storage (low compression).  The last 16:9 may actually be good for wide computer screens and HD TVs playback.Macro:Macro can show things you could only see with a microscope at 30x. It can show the hairs on the legs of a flea, 1 inch from the lens in sunlight. It can show the detailed imperfections in each R, G, and B emitter in each pixel of my computer screen.Other interesting features:They went overkill on settings for different subjects and lighting conditions. lots of options if you want them. For example, baby picture and flower modes. Focusing and lighting options are advanced, like tracking a subject once you lock on with half a click, or setting lighting to background, foreground, or spot. Individual face recognition is there, but not synced with eyes open. To have almost zero delay between pressing the button and the picture being taken, you have to press half-way first.In short, I think I will get used to the wide lens and even be glad I have it. Certainly I love taking pictures without the flash. The zoom is great. It's nearly a disaster that they don't allow standard storage in automatic settings.", "Date": "August 28, 2009"}, {"Title": "Not what I expected", "Author": "Julie CSD", "ReviewID": "RURHL80YO8EFE", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "I bought this Lumix ZS1 along with a Sony Cyber-Shot DSC-H20.  The Lumix in general have excellent reviews and people rave about their wide angle, sharp, good quality images, etc, but I found the opposite to be true.  It did have a wide angle, good for including more elements in your photos, but I found the images to be muted and hazy, and most of the time not sharp like the Sony.  This model has 12x zoom, while the Sony has 10x, but I found the Sony to have better reach, and its images were sharper when I zoomed in with the digital zoom.  I did several test shots with both, and in my opinion, the Sony won, no question about it.  The Lumix also has a very weak flash, which seemed to increase blurriness in lower light.  The Sony has a very powerful flash, but thankfully you can adjust its intensity.I thought I preferred a wide angle lens, but honestly, I much prefer the telephoto end and having crisp, sharp images.

I started with one of the first super zooms... added the mini pocket models as well. The last pocket model I owned, the FX-37, was excellent and the larger FZ-28 hard to beat, but I wanted both in one small camera. What do you know... they made the ZS1 with a 25-300mm zoom. In past reviews what I said still holds true in many ways on other models. The lenses on these cameras are amazing, Leica optics can't be beat. What has changed is that Panasonic has put all their efforts into improving their electronics. In the past poor menu design, button placement and chip noise plagued these cameras but I used them for the lens quality. Today, this latest camera has replaced my two camera system and I am very happy.This camera is small, small enough for your pocket but it is big enough that you will notice it there. It is also big enough that it is comfortable in your hand though, which is nice, but not so big as to attract a lot of attention in a crowded market. Probably the perfect travel camera (see the DP Review Travel Camera Shootout review, search Google!). The battery life is excellent, the optics are sharp and color is somewhat warm. The menu system is easy to figure out. The image results are wonderful and although if you dig enough you can find imperfections, please don't compare this to a $2000 professional SLR. It is not, but it is as close as your are going to get for the money and it is way easier to carry around. The flash on this little camera does better than I expected too, which is a bonus. I recently took it on a 3 day backapck trip and took over 300 photos and only needed to switch to my backup battery near the end. That was with a lot of \"on and off\" use which requires lens motor a lot and eats battery life. Not much flash use. Also, the image stabilization works very well and is now a feature I won't buy a camera without.There is only ONE gripe I have with this model and many have had it. The mode dial is the worst design I have seen and surprised since they have other models that solved this design issue. Why did they do this? It only has mode positions that can be selected on about half the dial, the other half is blank, but sadly the dial can be put into these \"blank\" positions. Because of the dial placement without any protection and the anemic click stops, it is easily bumped into the wrong position. It won't mess up your pictures, but you may sometimes find you are pressing the shutter button while in the wrong mode or worse yet, you try to shoot in a situation that requires a quick shutter finger and instead you find an error on the screen that says \"mode dial in wrong position\". Once they fix this issue the camera will have been improved to a full 5/5 stars. Now it is a 4.5/5 in my book.If you want something small, with great optics, great images, a good flash for a small camera and a great battery life (by the way, don't upgrade firmware because all the new firmware does is STOP you from being able to use aftermarket 3rd party batteries which work fine and are way cheaper) this is your camera.... welcome to the Lumix family!", "Date": "September 4, 2009"}, {"Title": "Really fine camera -- a spoiler", "Author": "Ronald K. Goodenow", "ReviewID": "RYZR6C4TXNXTA", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I'm a pretty die-hard Olympus user and have worked my way though many of its digital offerings over the past several years, now using the E330 and E510 dslrs with a large number of Olympus and Sigma lenses for some semi-pro and personal use. I travel a lot and so wanted to have a good backup, my wonderful Oly 5060 being too large for most of my pockets and my year old Canon A550 (a fine performer with the AA's I like) being too limited in terms of zoom, particularly at the wide end. I didn't look closely at Oly compacts due to some pretty spotty reviews and my feeling that the company has pretty well stopped innovating in that market.Having read a bunch of reviews I trust I purchased the ZS1 a couple of weeks ago and have given it a real workout, attending a Red Sox game at Fenway Park and then almost a week on the rocky coast of Maine. To stay light when walking around I slapped a long zoom telephoto on my Oly 510 and put my ZS1 in a shirt pocket to cover everything between 25mm and about 150mm, where my Oly 140-600 (35 equiv) picked up. A great combo. No need to change lenses in windy conditions, though if I needed them they were in a nearby car. OK, some main points:- the Lumix takes gorgeous photos with virtually no noise up through ISO 400 at ALL zoom lengths; image stabilization is quite effective; not quite that of my Oly 510 but perfectly adequate- the IA mode, what with its oft use of multiple exposure areas and selection of a scene mode is dead on, and I found its accuracy equal or superior to my Oly in many circumstances (even when I occasionally used one of my other Oly lenses rather than normally quirky long lenses; Oly dslrs have many great qualities but focusing, in my opinion, is not one of them). Of the hundreds of photos taken none had focusing or serious exposure issues. NONE, and exposure ones I had were taken care of in easy post processing- at first I got limited battery time, topping out around 100 pics (with a fair amount of lcd reviewing), but as the battery went through charge cycles time has increased to the point where yesterday in the course of any hour of messing around I got over 650 shots and the battery was still going strong!)- it is very quick to start up and get off that first shot. About the same as my Olys, which go through a sensor cleaning cycle.- though there are no manual controls to speak of I tend to mainly rely on exposure compensation and the camera's regular normal mode makes that very easy; and there are ISO settings as wellIf I have a complaint it is that Panasonic's latest firmware (1.2) does not permit the use of third-party batteries, something that Panny really doesn't tell us, nor did the seller I purchased a clone from. Aggravating. One can download firmware version 1.1, which permits clones, but I didn't want to mess with that. Instead I ran down a rare OEM battery on Amazon, at a premium price, of course.This all means that I have a camera that is a perfect take along. In very informal or business travel it easily provides virtually all the features and quality one would need. In situations where one wants the flexibility of a good dslr, it is the perfect backup or accompaniment. In fact, now and then I think about all the investment in my dslr's, most lenses for which cost twice what the Lumix cost, and scratch my head. If somehow this little camera could take an add-on flash it would be a marvelous product.Finally, it would be great if some of the large companies could settle on a battery standard and stop reaming consumers for that extra bit of hard-earned cash, the main reason I have always preferred AA's in small cameras. Oly has used the BLM-1 for years now in most of its dslrs, beginning with the 5060 point and shoot. They are easily interchanged and clones, which I find very good, readily purchased (Oly also makes a little lithium battery holder which means, practically, that if one needs emergency power one can head to many drug and hardware stores or Walmart -- that stays in my shaving kit). It's especially irritating that Panny is apparently not manufacturing many batteries for my new camera. A stupid situation.-----------Update:Just took the ZS1 and my Olympus E-510 (with three small kit lenses) on a trip and did a lot of comparison shooting. Scenery, family gathering, some event stuff. Some observations:-- focusing on the Panny is more accurate and, in most cases, as fast as on the dslr; it is certainly superior in relatively low light situations and gave me superb results up to ISO 800 and at low shutter speeds-- sharpness on the Panny is a tad less than on the Oly, but can be easily adjusted in post processing-- with a little fiddling I was able to get excellent flash results from the Panny; the 'manual' setting is far superior to the IA one.So I call the camera a 'spoiler'. Is it superior to a good dslr? Of course not. Fewer options and accessories. But for many kinds of travel, candid photography and situations which don't stress the flash it is a heck of a camera; among the best I have owned. For those of us who choose netbooks over heavy laptops and just want to be light and flexible it would be hard to do better.", "Date": "August 29, 2009"}, {"Title": "First impressions - super camera!", "Author": "Chris A. Kantack", "ReviewID": "RE48IH50QF5J3", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I'm a big Canon fan.  Indeed I almost bought the SX120IS super zoom instead of this one.  But I wanted the ability to have a super wide angle setting (25 mm) that the Canon camera just can't deliver.  (The SX120IS only goes out to 36mm on the wide end.)  Also, I saw in a number of reviews where the SX120IS exhibited higher than average barrel distortion on its wide angle zoom range whereas the Leica made lens on the Lumix ZS1 shines in exhibiting virtually none of the lens distortions that plague many zoom lenses.Though I've only had the Lumix ZS1 for a few days, I can tell you this:  1.  The Leica zoom lens on this camera really is as good as others have been raving about.  2.  This camera takes great shots both indoors and out.  3.  The build quality of this camera is excellent.  It's nearly all metal in construction and very solid.  4.  I'm not experiencing any of the useability problems that I've read in other reviews.  The controls are  very well laid out.  I don't have a problem with the dial placements or the menus or anything of that  nature.Another criticism I've read about the ZS1 is that it doesn't have aperture or shutter priority picture taking modes.  In my opinion, there are more than enough settings to obtain the desired shutter speed or aperture control that you would need.  Indeed there is a minimum shutter speed setting readily available!So far, in my early use of this camera, the only \"fault\" I can find (if you can call it that) is that the automatic white balance setting isn't always perfect in indoor light.  This is true with any digital camera of course and there are ways to manually correct this.Though I've been taking pictures for nearly 35 years, I haven't owned a lot of cameras.  I tend to find a camera I like and then use it \"forever\".

Recently the camera fell from the seat of my truck to the snow and salt covered road as I got out of my truck.  I didn't realise I had dropped the camera until later, and three hours after it hit the road I came back and recovered it.  The camera did not function at first, but the next morning it was as good as new, presumably because it had warmed up.  Because I had replaced a year old Canon that had failed I was hoping this camera would prove more durable.  It certainly has. I wanted a camera I could carry in my shirt pocket that would give me very good image quality and serve for family snapshots as well as scenery shots.  The lens range on this camera is ideal for me and makes the camera a very versatile point and shoot device.  Image quality seems superior to the Canon I had. I am an older person with an older person's eyesight, and the LCD screen is the best of the few I have used in daylight situations.  This camera has fewer features than many, which is not at all a problem for me.  I wanted a point and shoot camera and the feature set is more than enough, in my opinion, for this sort of use.  The controls seem comfortable and easy to use to me.  I get excellent results from macro shots to full extension of the long range lens and the camera does the thinking for me.  That's not what many enthusiasts want, but as a take along camera that doesn't get in the way and yet is almost instantly ready to capture very good images of anything from a wildflower by the road to a wide angle indoor scene to pulling in a heron on the other side of a stream I find it serves very well.  Battery life seems very good, however the camera software will not allow use of aftermarket batteries, or at least those not approved by Panasonic, and I didn't find any that were.  This may not be a bad thing given the stories of counterfeit and dangerous batteries from you-know-where, but plan on paying around $40 for a second battery (since I wrote this the price seems to have gone down at some retailers).

I really liked it and it took great pics, but I got tired of lugging around the bulky camera bag and having to switch the lens all the time for different shots.So, for a upcoming Disney World trip I decided to start looking around for a digital camera.The most important thing I wanted was a good zoom lens to match what I had had with my 35 MM. After many hours of researching and reading reviews I decided on a Panasonic Lumix for sure, but then needed to decide which one. Not wanting to spend a ton of money,I finally decided on the DMC-ZS1 12x zoom, 10 MP.It has everything I needed and more.Things I love about this camera:-it already is set up with a wide angle lens, everything fits in the pic!-the zoom is fantastic! It brought up things from really far away-much closer than I had expected.-no more buying B&W; film for cool pictures-you can change to standard (color), sepia or black and white. I took a great pic of my son in a coon skin cap holding a pop gun in Disny World in B&W; and it looks great! I also took some of the 'Tower of Terror' ride in Hollywood Studios in sepia and they also turned out great!-you can change the 'Scene' to anything from food, fireworks, night portrait, sports, and MANY more, at leat 20 different ones. Several of the restaurants we ate a had small thin squares of chocolate with the hotels name on it stuck in a slice of cake or pie and by switching the scene mode to 'food' it took great up close pics and the hotel name on the tiny piece of choc. is super clear!  I also have pics of the kids playing on the beach in complete darkness, but by switching the scene mode to night portrait they also came out very good.-it is light weight-the battery is very small and the battery charger has a fold in plug making it very compact to store.  We were there for 7 days, used the camera every day and charged the battery twice.-the fireworks pics came out very nice from Epcot.-if you don't want to switch the scene for what you need you can just put it on auto and it will focus and flash for you.  All pics came out great.-I like that it has such a large LCD screen.  I was able to hold it above my head and take shots above the crowds, so that other people weren't in my pictures. Since the screen is so large I could hold it up high and  still see what I was taking a pic of.-you can video.  I took a short video, but did not play with this feature much at all.I really played with this camera at Disney and found NOTHING that I did not like about it.  This camera sure gives an average and experienced picture taker more bang for their buck.  You really can't ask for more, BUT....guess what?When I got home I knew I could view the pics on my TV screen, so I plug it in and the camera asks if you want to do a 'slideshow'. I click on slideshow and sit back to watch all the pics on the TV screen.  Well, all of the sudden this music starts playing, very nice music, to the slideshow!! Imagine my surprise.

I could even live with a slightly smaller LCD but the basic engine, the excellent Leica lens, the solid Japanese construction, superb wide angle and zoom fulfilled all my essential checklists.Even though it did not come with a camera case (a detail that irks me from most manufacturers nowadays) there were no other accessories that I needed apart from a decent capacity SDHC card.I am more than happy with the ZS1 and have no regrets in picking it rather than the 33% more expensive ZS3.

And last year in SE Asia, I had to keep my DSLR wrapped in plastic during most of the Lao New Year Water Festival to protect it from all the spraying water.  This little camera would have been much more useful as it would have been easier to protect and take out to grab a photo of the festivities.  I missed many photo opportunities with the DSLR.I also tried several smaller cameras and have used a few of the \"super zoom\" compacts with zooms from 20X to 26X, but I have't been real happy with the image quality.  The additional zoom length simply compounded image quality problems due to the exaggeration of camera shake at extremely long focal lengths, even with image stabilization.  From my experience, I think the 20X and up zoom capability is more a sales gimmick and leads to lens quality compromises and additional blur from movement.So I bought this camera after reading a dpreview web comparative review of small zooms to see if the ZS1 could deliver quality closer to my wishes.  I have been extremely pleased with it, although I will admit that there is ultimately nothing like the quality and flexibility of a DSLR.  However, I find myself taking the camera more places, taking more shots and having a large number of very nice pictures.  So I begin to think that the trade-off is worth it for me.As a former dedicated SLR user, I feel silly (and amateurish) having to use an LCD instead of a viewfinder and prefer looking through the lens for the clarity of the subject and the additional point of support for getting blur-free shots.  But it is a compromise I am getting used to and the image quality of this camera is very good.I have posted a series of photos I grabbed in my backyard to show the difference between 25 mm and 300 mm equivalent (compared to 35 mm film camera) and cropped two photos and combined them into a single image to show how well the 12X zoom details from 20 feet compare to a no zoom photo from about 2 feet.  I find that the 12X zoom is more than adequate for my photography.My only regret at the moment is not buying the ZS3 to get the higher resolution LCD screen (perhaps I would also use the HD video on the ZS3, but it isn't critical to me).  I suspect that the high resolution LCD on the ZS3 would be helpful in ascertaining while shooting whether a shot is free from blur and properly focused before getting home and putting the photos on my computer.  I think I may order the ZS3 and sell this camera on ebay.ADDED 9-2-09The more I use this camera, the better I like it.

We didn't want to \"haul\" our Nikon D40 and few lenses around everywhere with us.  This camera fits nice in a jacket or cargo pants pocket and was very convenient for tourism.I was duped by the 12x OPTICAL zoom and the Leica lens.  The zoom and lens work well together and take some really beautiful pictures.  Other reviewers mention adjusting the zoom can be finicky, as it moves a little too fast - I agree - it seems you can never quite get the frame you want the first try without overshooting it.  This is more a nuisance than a deal breaker.So, I bought this camera because of the optical zoom and Leica lens and completely missed the fact that it is incredibly noisy at low light levels.  My eight-year-old Canon S200 pocket camera blows the Panasonic out of the water when it comes to low-light shots.Well, my poor choice wouldn't have been so bad if we vacationed somewhere sunny and did things mostly during the day.  :/  We spent a few nights getting lost in Venice (in December), so it was dark by 6pm.  Lots of really beautiful sights in Venice at night, and all of my shots are grainy and full of noise, even after limiting the ISO range of the camera.Also, the latest firmware of the camera was only developed to recognize Panasonic batteries - use anything else (i.e. affordable, and you get an error that you are not using an approved battery and the darned thing turns off.  This can be fixed by going back to the old level of firmware - you don't lose any functionality, just gain the option of using aftermarket batteries.

My intent was to purchase the sx120 but it was missing a few features I felt I wanted (wide angle lens, auto bracket mode) and it was bulkier.  While researching I found a few cameras that met my criteria and decided on the Panasonic.Likes* Wide angle lens 25mm* Auto Bracketing* Image stabilization* Intuitive menus* Nice Build quality* Can zoom while recording video which you cannot with the Canon.* Nice size. Can actually put in your shirt pocket or pants.  You cannot do this with the cannon.* iA (intelligent Auto works well and adjust to macro, etc automatically)Dislikes* No flash intensity control* Thumb wheel turns too easily.* Prefer the button layouts of the cannons (thumb wheel and shutter buttons)to the Panasonic.  I think the different layout might improve the grip.* No manual controls.  Would really like to the ability to set the shutter speed.  :-(  (The canon will do this)* Would like to see more options on the thumb wheel like landscape mode, and night scene.  You can do with the panasonic but you must drill into a menu.  :-(* Non-standard battery.  The trade off here is that this does help make the camera smaller but is limiting when you go out to take a bunch of images with no chance to recharge.  Expensive to replace battery.* (added Jul 2010) Periodically I will shoot panoramic pictures.  The big issue with this camerea is that it doesn't change the file name for the pano images (the cannon does) and this is a problem.  They should be able to address with firmware update but I haven't seen it.  Let me claify, when you take several pictures you want to stitch you cannot tell by the file name that the image is part of a series.  When you go to look at your pics a week later on the chip you may not (probably will not) remember that the picture was part of a series.  You will see the image and say \"whoa what is that\" and think you just have a made bad shot when really it is part of bigger nicer image.  If the file names for panos started with a unique suffix then this could easily be avoided.  I have ended up accidentally deleting images due to this short comming.While the Panasonic is missing some features of the canon (manual controls, flash intensity)it makes up for these with size, and quality. If panasonic could implement a few of the canon's features then you would have an awesome little camera. The bottom line is that the best camera is the one you carry and use.

On my older camera, I can enter the information for 2 different pets.This camera does take fantastic pictures, which almost rival a DSLR, so if this camera will be your first Panasonic, you will be more than pleased with the picture quality.

On the trip, I took about 500 shots with the Lumix.  The lens range, from wide angle to mid telephoto was great.  Picture quality was good, as was focus speed, start up speed and zoom speed.  The camera performed well for a \"point and shoot\" in low light.  One issue was that the LCD did \"wash out\" a couple of times, but that is typical of a camera without an optical viewfinder.  Also, it is probably a good idea to charge the battery daily.  This camera is slightly larger than the average \"point and shoot\" but it still fit well into a pants pocket.  It was a bit too bulky for a shirt pocket.  It seems a very good travel camera for those who want snapshots on a trip and a very good travel camera for those who want to supplement their large DSLR.

I wanted to fully understand the camera before writing the review. Guess what? I still don't understand the camera - the manual is not user friendly at all. However, I learned enough to take some great pictures (I've posted a few for you to see). What sold me was the 25 mm/12x optical zoom lens. I wanted to have a portable camera that could take wide angle shots of stunning landscapes as well as close-ups of people without looking conspicuous. This camera is an excellent value considering all the features that are packed into its compact, well-designed body. The best, most comprehensive review for this camera is at Digital Camera Reviews: [...] If you want to know what my experience has been like, read on.Camera Size/ViewfinderIn terms of size, it's compact but not small or light enough to fit comfortably in your pant/shirt pocket. The body feels quite sturdy and has some weight to it unlike many of its competitors. The 2.75 inch screen is a nice change from the tiny one on my Nikon Coolpix 5200. Before the Nikon, I was using an old, manual Yashica. I don't miss the viewfinder - most are too small in digital compacts to be functional. The one bug I found in this camera: When you're shooting in bright/sunny conditions, rays sometimes appear on the screen. They don't affect the quality of the picture but it is an annoyance.Battery LifeI did not buy an extra battery for the trip - they're very expensive. With a cheap adapter, you can easily charge the battery at your hotel. If you refrain from playing back your pictures and using video, you'll easily get a day's shooting on one charge. So do yourself a favor and don't spend $60 on an extra battery, unless you're gonna be in some remote, godforsaken place. I bought a Class 4 8 Gig SD card (I didn't take video). At the end of the three week trip, I still had plenty of room for pictures on my card.Image Quality/Ease of shootingI mainly used IA (instant auto) and a few of the scene modes. The soft skin setting works nicely for portraits. In IA, you can adjust picture size and color. You can also access \"burst\" mode. There are a few manual settings like shutter speed, white balance and metering. There are also creative settings like Sepia and B&W;, although you may want to save this for your photo editing software.The extended zoom is a big disappointment. It doesn't want to focus. I wouldn't recommend using it on any moving object. Wide angle is the main reason why I bought this camera and I haven't been disappointed with it.My night shots of Saigon came out very acceptable, although there is some noise.  Speaking of flash, I really liked that you could turn off this feature and keep it off. My friend's digital compact always defaulted to the flash setting. She had to turn it off every time she a took a picture.This became a major annoyance for her.The colors are quite vivid and sharp, however, pictures taken in bright light seem a tad over-exposed (even when using Instant Auto). Other reviewers also noticed this in their pictures. This is not an easy thing to correct and Panasonic should look towards improving in this area.Over all, the DMC-ZS1 did me well in Vietnam and I'm very happy with how my pictures came out. This is a great travel camera if you're looking to go beyond snapshots. However, Panasonic still needs to improve in a few areas before achieving the status of a perfect compact camera.", "Date": "January 16, 2010"}, {"Title": "I love this camera!", "Author": "Lifelong learner", "ReviewID": "R8OUY5RPNC2NM", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "My purposes for this camera are to be able to zoom in (optically), to have easy portability, and to be able to understand the settings fairly intuitively.

The optical zoom can be pushed to 21x, at the cost of resolution. Everything is pretty much automatic. Lots of fun. It has many setting choices (parameters like file size, aspect ratios, metering--accessible on Quick Menu during shooting) and numerous Scene modes (including panorama sequence, for stitching in software supplied on CD). The \"Food\" Scene even made my cooking look like real food! Still more fun. Records 5 sec audio with still pictures. Numerous playback modes. It takes about 160 highest resolution pictures per battery charge. I carry it in a little protective bag, and it still fits in my (pants) pocket!I had trouble seeing the LCD image, camera focus, and tiny icons in raking sunlight, either because the screen washed out, or reflected my sunny face. What do I do, look through a funnel instead, or drape a black cloth over the camera and my head (like the original glass plate view cameras a century ago!)? There's no viewfinder, so we can't hold the camera to our face and avoid the whole problem. (Note that these can be problems for most recent compact cameras, with their fixed LCD screens.) Awkward placement of shutter button on mid line and inboard of mode dial and zoom knob.PC and AV cables, as well as one battery and charger, are included (no memory card, although 40MB is built in). Other acessories are expensive, if not a gouge. Buying the optional AC adaptor to power picture transfers will set you back $130 altogether, due to the additional required cable-connector purchase. The AC adaptor does not recharge the battery. All these are proprietary ($$$) rather than standard cables. Note also that Panasonic firmware 1.2 does not allow the use of non-Pansasonic ($$$) aftermarket ($) batteries as spares.The ZS1 does only 848x640 max motion-JPEG monaural movie (while ZS3 adds AVCHD 720HD in stereo). If the camera won't automatically take a picture I like (for example, depth of field, right amount of motion blur), it is hard to alter settings to something I liked better. The camera has no aperture- or shutter speed-priority modes, let alone full manual control. What a shame! That's why I say it is a snapshot camera, rather than THE gloriously pocketable substitute for an SLR. If you demand such creative controls in a faux-SLR, consider the Canon Powershot SX200 IS (whose feature set in the same form factor is better compared to the Lumix DMC-ZS3, both with added HD video, a bigger LCD, and higher price).", "Date": "September 22, 2009"}, {"Title": "Solid camera", "Author": "Travis M Loux", "ReviewID": "R1R9RSR2RBJ5P3", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I used to have a Lumix TZ-1, which was great, and was hoping this would be an upgrade over that.  Most of the technical details are improved (10x to 12x zoom, 5MP to 10MP), but as a general user I can't really tell much of a difference in picture quality.  The camera is noticeably smaller though, which is nice, plus some extra features.  The biggest downfall is that the lens on this camera extends (3/4 to 1 inch) even when the zoom is set to 1x, making it harder to carry around while it is on (once it goes to power save mode or is turned off the lens fully retracts into the camera).  I ended up just turning the camera on and off all day, which was a bit of a hassle.Overall, this camera is great for regular use, with dozens of options that are very useful and easy to navigate.

I've gotta say I'm quite impressed with the capability of this camera.Size: this camera is quite small. it can be easily put in your vest or jacket pocket. when i visited NYC, i had this camera in my vest pocket the whole time, so i can randomly take it out for a shot.Battery: the battery life claims it takes up to 300 images. i am not sure if it's related to my setting or what, i take 3MP in iA mode, i actually took up to 500 images and couple less than 1 minute video clips in WVGA before the battery ran out. however, i'd still suggest any one who buys this camera to get a spare battery just in case, since this is not AA battery that anyone can replace easily. the oem battery is nearly impossible to find, or just expensive. the non-oem are everywhere, just need to make sure it works with the new firmware. and technically speaking, non-oem are at least 1000 amh+, which hold more juice than oem battery.control: the on/off button is obvious and you can feel with your finger. i can just grab the camera with one hand, turn it on on the way out of my pocket and take photo right when it's in front of me. other control such as zoom in/ out, menu selection is quite standard like canon, etc. nothing too fancy.lens: the 12x zoom is amazing, so is the optical stabilization. i was literally able to take a photo of a concert in low light condition, with 12x zoom, and without worry about blurry image. 25mm zoom is great for take images such as whole building in close distance, indoor image, group shot, landscape etc. i am amazed how wide the angle this camera has without having fish eye effects, or any distortion on the edge of the image.flash: i personally don't like the flash as it literally destroy the original color of the image. but when i need it, it's quite bright for indoor, or outdoor brightening object purpose. the recharge time is short, less than a second as far as i know, but i also heard that as battery gets older, the recharge interval time will also be affected.image quality: since i mainly use iA mode, the images are overall pretty nice. with the optical stabilized lens, i was able to take some indoor shot in low light condition without any blurriness, but the iso might be a bit high and more noisy, still bearable compare to my A40 though. the color is generally accurate, the images are not too grainy. the biggest drawback is night shot, the auto mode with night shot is bad, it doesn't capture enough light or doesn't open up enough. the whole photo looks like a pitch black piece of paper with few bright dots. for night shot, you will have to go manual on the settings to get what Canon or Nikon can automatically do. i generally just set the manual mode for night shot only, so when i need to take the night shot, just turn the dial and it's good to go.overall, i love this camera! quite small, excellent battery life, really good optical stabilized lens with 12x zoom and 25mm side angle, easy to control, and it's really just point and shoot. the only draw back is the battery isn't AA (which is cheaper and can be easily replaced), and the night shot is not up to par unless done manually.", "Date": "June 22, 2010"}, {"Title": "Great Camera.......Fantastic Zoom", "Author": "rifrickendiculous", "ReviewID": "R8O2RPFLNNYYS", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I have to start by saying I never write reviews, but after having this camera for only a day, I have to say it is incredible.

I decided to purchase from Amazon as I have with dozens of items in the past. The fast shipping was appreciated.  I was extremely impressed with every aspect of this camera!!!  It was extremely easy to use, the construction is solid, the wide lens created incredibly crisp pictures with a lot of depth.  The Film Grain setting created some unreal shots...after 300+ shots between 3 European cities, I can HONESTLY say there was not a bad picture in the bunch!  I recommend this camera to any level photographer. I don't have one negative thing to say about this camera!

It is used for general purpose \"picture taking\". My goal has been achieved.  The unit is reasonably compact.  It fits easily into my shirt pocket.  The picture quality is good even for hand held shots that utilize the zoom feature extensively.  Only two problems have been noted so far.  (1) The Intelligent Auto Mode does not seem to be very intelligent -- several photos taken using it were out of focus due to incorrect interpretation of the intended subject of the pictures.  I use the Normal Picture mode with default settings almost exclusively at this point.  The picture quality is much better. (2) The lack of a viewfinder restricts the camera's functionality in brightly lit settings.  The monitor is not bright enough to rely on for framing the pictures in those situations.  For those two reasons, I rate the camera with 4 stars rather than 5 stars for my purposes.

The Panasonic fits easily into a coat pocket, and OK in pants/shirt pocket.  It is compact but a little on the heavy side.  The construction seems sturdy.Picture quality is good. Even though there is a lot less glass than the bigger camera I got rid of, it still takes good pictures even in low light.  The ISO400 looks reasonable, and the anti-shake really works.  The flash is fine.  Purple fringing and distortion are not bad at all, even at the ends of the zoom range.  The processing has a bias towards smoothness, so the detail is not great at full size on the computer, but fit-to-window and printed pictures look very nice.Battery life, focus, shutter lag, and shot-to-shot speed are all also fine for a point and shoot.  It comes with a Li ion battery, but it has to be removed to recharge.  I like the built in lens cover, no cap to lose or get in the way.There are plenty of subject modes but not a lot of manual control over shutter or aperture.  At least it generally makes good decisions about focus, exposure, etc.  The zoom range is 12x, but part of that is wide angle, so it doesn't really give 12x on the long side.  It is usable to the top end of 9x real zoom or so, whereas I would not use my old camera (a true 12x) above 10x or so because of fringing and shake.Overall quite satisfied.

Jackson", "ReviewID": "RJ82MCTZGLRWO", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "I learned to take pictures using film and an old 35mm. It was difficult to make up my mind on choosing a digital camera. I researched for years before being satisfied with what I heard about the Panasonic Lumix series. From the very first, I oh so loved this camera; it's small, and I could have it with me all the time without lugging a big machine for special occasions only. When new, it took great pictures, and videos, with terrific sound. Everything I'd heard about the camera was true and my expectations with the quality of the photos, and ease of use were exceeded.It worked well, for about a year beyond the assurance provided by the 1 year warranty. Then the camera stopped focusing while I was on holiday. In immediate need of a camera, with no time for the learning curve associated with a new piece of technology, I bought the closest Lumix (DMC-TZ8)I could find to the one I'd already fallen in love with. This updated version worked fine, though not quite as well as this DMC-ZS1. Then my second Lumix went berserk after about six months of use, so that when the camera is turned on the focus mechanism zooms in and out humming non stop for no apparent reason. Given my history with Lumix cameras I would recommend getting an extended warranty, if available. They're terrific while they last, and they do at least maintain their small size. But I wouldn't expect them to last like the old reflex cameras.", "Date": "March 23, 2012"}, {"Title": "Did everything I expected, still working - but do keep it protected in a case", "Author": "S. Saunders", "ReviewID": "R2I8QQ7HUIUXS1", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I bought this camera 2.5 years ago and have hauled it around town and on vacations. I'd owned, and really liked, a prior generation Lumix, the Panasonic Lumix DMC-TZ3K, and this camera - the ZS1 - was an upgrade in many respects.The main quibble I have with this camera concerns the automatic built-in lens shutter/cover that closes when the camera is turned off or used in \"replay\" mode, and opens when the camera's turned on or used in \"shooting\" mode. It's made of thin plastic and can be easily damaged. It's the same kind of shutter as on the TZ3 lens, and I learned the hard way to keep the camera protected in a case when not in use. I'd tossed the TZ3 into my purse without the case, and the shutter/cover on the TZ3 was damaged from contact with something in there. Fortunately I'd bought it at Costco and was within the 90 day return window so I was able to return the TZ3 and buy another one. Which I did keep in the protective case with no further problems.I've kept this camera in a case when not in use and the lens mechanism still works perfectly.I also own a DSLR which I can haul out for serious photo taking with all kinds of creative control, but I carry this camera a lot more than the much larger DSLR and have been satisfied with the photos I've taken with it. They won't compete with DSLR photos overall but they are almost always enough for my purposes. I confess that I've used the auto settings on this camera almost exclusively, with the main tweak to force the flash off. I'm sure that if I'd used more of the custom and scene settings available I could have achieved even better results.The wide lens on this camera is hard to beat. So often my preferred shots when traveling are of street scenes, landscapes, and room interiors. The 25mm lens has not disappointed me in this respect. I can also get the whole extended family into a group shot from a reasonable distance. I've enjoyed the 12x zoom too.I decided to post this review as a fond farewell to my ZS1, because yesterday I received its replacement - the Panasonic DMC-ZS9. The price for the ZS9 was so good I couldn't resist it, as it's an upgrade to the ZS1 in so many ways, including more manual controls, better resolution video, and a 16x optical zoom. (You can compare the two cameras at the website snapsort; however the ZS9 isn't in their database, but the ZS8 is so use that one for the comparison. The ZS9 and ZS8 are identical except that the ZS9 records video with stereo microphones instead of the ZS8's mono.)If I hadn't found the upgrade camera at such a good price, I'd not have replaced my ZS1. My rational thoughts are to sell the ZS1 for whatever price it will fetch, but my sentimental side will probably prevail and I'll keep it. Besides, it uses the same battery as the ZS9 so now I have an extra battery.I have no hesitation in recommending the ZS1 as a reliable, versatile and very easy to tote point and shoot digicam.", "Date": "December 24, 2011"}, {"Title": "Great camera", "Author": "Daron K", "ReviewID": "R2JP89FJHKFJBU", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Great camera!

This camera sold me on the 12x optical zoom, the great reviews, the Panasonic name (we own two Panasonic Plasma tvs, a DVD camcorder, DVD players, and now a blu-ray player ... all Panasonic).  Let's just say that when it comes to electronics, we tend to buy Panasonic because the quality has always been great, the price is always reasonable for what you get, and we just don't have issues with their products.  I saw this camera, and while it was a bit bigger than our Canon Elph, we decided to give it a try.  Plus, the price was fantastic for what we were getting.  We have been so happy with this camera.

My biggest surprise was the 12x optical zoom. I figured a 12x zoom would need a tripod mount but this was not so. Hand held at 12x zoom took beautifully focused pictures. I just returned from a trip to the United Kingdom and took close to 300 photos. It even did great from a moving vehicle. All shots were taken in the iAuto mode and the camera did great.The only negative thing is (same as any other point-and-shoot camera) it does not do well in low light unless you are very close to the subject. My mistake was to zoom in on a subject in the low light and of course that made things worse.There is another quirky thing that I noticed after viewing the photos on a computer. I don't know whether it is the wide angle lens or the zoom that causes a vertical perspective distortion, I think that's what it's called. The problem is on the photos I have of tall buildings. The structure in the center would be vertical but the buildings on the sides tilt inwards at the top of the frame.

The unit suffered no drop or bump whatsoever, and was inside so cold wasn't a factor. In fact, just to stave off this from happenning, I had purchased and installed an optical glass screen protector which was placed on the unit when I unpacked it.

The images are very good, just not great!  So, if you want the eye-popping color and contrast offered by many SLR cameras/lenses, the ZS1 is not going to be able do that.  However, compared to a few other point & shoots I have used, the ZS1's images are very good.Also, as with most point & shoots, even the ZS1 cannot compare to the speed of picture-taking offered by an SLR.  So, if you are taking a lot of pictures of children, sports, etc., point & shoots as a class sometimes miss the shot.  The ZS1 is no different.  I miss a lot of shots with the ZS1, because children do not like to sit still very long.Video loses quality quickly in low-light, as is often the case, even with dedicated video cameras.On balance, though, the ZS1 is a very good camera.  If you want portability, very good images and video, and do not care too much about being able to snap images rapidly, then the ZS1 is an excellent choice.

The quality of the photos on iPhoto is mediocre. They were muddy and dark, even though the shots were taken on the automatic setting with the flash on. Maybe we don't know how to use it correctly, but you almost need an enginerring degree to understand this camera.", "Date": "January 7, 2010"}, {"Title": "10X OPticAL ZoOM", "Author": "MB", "ReviewID": "R10IYS8XHHVYNE", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "It is a good camera if you need good optical zoom in a compact size", "Date": "September 18, 2009"}, {"Title": "Paid for Never Delivered!!!.", "Author": "Emily C.
