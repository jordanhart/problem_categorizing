For a point and shoot the S70 produces excellent low noise photographs at not only ISO 50, but 100 as well with very acceptable noise levels at 200 and 400 as well.  This will come as a welcome relief to those who are accustomed to unacceptable noise levels in point and shoot camera above ISO 50.The dynamic range, color rendition, and solid build quality are very impressive.  I love the metallic finish.  If you are so inclined the camera possesses RAW capability which comes in handy if you are going to explore the possibilities of the digital darkroom.The white balance, as in virtually all point and shoot cameras and most digital SLR's, is less than ideal.  I wish Canon would attach a flash shoe to this camera.  But, you can't have it all, at least not in the S70!The size of this camera, given its capabilities, is perfect - not too small and not too large.  I liked the S60, but this is a very significant improvement.Whether you are a beginner  or an experienced digital photographer this camera will serve you well.  For the beginner plenty of automation and programmed functions in order that you can begin immediately and get excellent results.  And for the more experienced photographer the camera offers a plethora of controls including RAW format to extend your capabilities.", "Date": "October 30, 2004"}, {"Title": "Great Camera", "Author": "T.

I previously had a Sony that had slow response times between shots and less then impressive colors and clarity.My family just finshed a week long cruise and used the Canon quite extensively.  Very few times did I have to delete a picture because I was unhappy (unlike the sony).  I am still getting use to the various 'presets' for diffent environmental setting (portrait, highspeed, etc.).I also bought a 1 gig Ultra Memory Card ($129 @ Best Buy).  Must have!

Lehmann", "ReviewID": "RIKM66EL06JSA", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "First of all, I am not a serious camera buff. The S70 is my first digital camera because I wanted to wait until the technology was proven before I jumped in. That said, the S70 has proven to be a great camera that takes great pictures.The only problem I have noticed is that the autofocus has a hard time resolving anything without sharp edges. When I was at the Smithsonian a couple of weeks ago taking pictures of some impresssionist paintings they gave the autofocus headaches.My bud is a camera freak. He just bought a $5000 12 MP Nikon to add to his collection of high dollar Nikons. I would ask him what such and such function does and, after explaining it to me, he would be surprised that a pocket camera would offer that feature. For example, for an important picture that might not be able to be shot twice, it has settings that will tap out three photos-one regularly exposed, one underexposed, and one overexposed.He was one to snub his nose at small point and shoot cameras but, being a cameraphile, he cant resist playing around with mine when thats all there is. Over the past few weeks of playing around with it the S70 has earned his respect. He was impressed enough with enough that he recommended it to another acquaintance that asked him for his opinon.UPDATE. I have had the S70 for several months now and have nothing to say about it but good things. I carry it around almost everywhere I go. Like any unashamed amateur, most of the pics I take are junk. Like any digital camera, a view screen and the delete button take care of most of that. Occasionally though, the S70 has surprised me. On more than one occasion people in varying degrees of separation have come across some of the S70 pics and pulled out money for enlarged copies of them. I'm under no illusions of grandeur, most of the subjects are lonely windmills or other icons of rural Texas, and the amounts involved won't pay any bills, but the fact that it happens at all is new to me. I uploaded to the customer pics section one of several S70 photos, taken on a whim, now enlarged to 16x20 and hanging in a local Fraternal Order of Police office (paid for with their $$).Now the S70 is obviously not a pro camera. I haven't seen nor heard of any Time or National Geographic correspondents dashing through rainforests or dodging bullets in Iraq with one. But is has, unexpectedly, made me look more competent than I have any right to claim to be. The fact that something like that happens at all is testament to the capabilities of the S70.", "Date": "June 2, 2005"}, {"Title": "A very good compromise between compactness and functionality", "Author": "ciniminis", "ReviewID": "R30X8579MZA8M7", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "In the 7-megapixel class alone, Canon makes at least 3 current consumer models: the G6 (w/ 4X zoom), the S70 (w/ 3.6X zoom), and SD500 (the new \"Elph\", w/ 3X zoom).  These are priced similarly, within $100 of difference.  (Incidentally, here's a tidbit about the zooming capabilities - the closest telephoto zoom of the \"3.6X\" on the S70 is like a 3X zoom on most other cameras.  The extra \".6\" is on the wide angle end, which is rather unique and is nice for taking in vast sceneries.)My previous digital camera (a Sony Cyber-Shot with 3 megapixels and 3X zoom) was one of the ultra compacts and although I loved the portability and was content with the lower pixel count, I was dissatisfied with the graininess and contrast of the pictures (despite much effort to adjust to lighting situations within the limited interface) and ultimately I put the blame on the quality of the optics.For selecting my new camera, the G6 receives rave reviews almost everywhere I looked, but I wasn't willing to jump to such a large camera (when I am out and taking pictures it's for fun, not for professional use - carrying a big hunk of a camera inteferes with enjoying the trip).  The SD500 is one of Canon's Elph series cameras with an amazingly diminutive size, but previous experience makes me doubtful of the ability of another ultra compact.  And even though reviews do say the SD500 takes good quality pictures, one thing's for sure - it has fewer controls than I'd like.  The S70 happily sits half way between those two, is reasonably compact, and has just enough user controllability that I thought I needed.  Most importantly of all, the S70 seems to have just enough size to house the quality optics necessary for taking great pictures.  My old camera used to take perfectly respectable outdoors photos, but in any indoors lighting condition it took either grainy pictures with bad contrast, or extremely over exposed pictures if I enable the flash.  Not so with this one.  Every snap shot so far has been crisp and vivid, with good contrast and beautiful flesh tones.  The resolution at 7MP is more than necessary for any practical inkjet-printing-at-home purpose, but on the other hand it allows for quite a bit of freedom for cropping if you need to re-frame a shot to get the best composition.Also worth mentioning, a slightly gimmicky but very nifty function is that this camera facilitates taking multiple pictures that can be seamlessly \"stitched\" together (by showing a portion of the previous picture when you take the next shot).  This allows great possibilities of making VR files where the viewer can navigate the surroundings 360 degrees.  I am toying with the idea of producing a few \"virtual\" house walk-throughs for a friend's webpage, who's a real estate agent.Now, what I don't like about the S70 is that the mechanical motors for the moving parts operate way too loudly.  You can go to CNET to see a video clip of the zoom lens coming out and hear what I mean.  Otherwise, just a few minor quibbles on the interface which is arranged not quite as conveniently as I'd like.  No complaints whatsoever for the picture quality.

Worse still, the left 4-way button quit working after only two weeks of use. As for the latter, the button that failed felt different than the others when it did work. If any button is different in tactile feedback, return the unit immediately because it may fail down the line.What I liked about the Powershot S70:(1) Amazing detail - the photos were great under ideal circumstances (but only under ideal circumstances!), (2) oodles of manual controls in a compact format, (2) 28 mm equivalent wide angle, and (4) the protective slider over the lens (great for camping, skiing, and hiking).What I disliked about the Powershot S70:(1) LCD is unusable in bright daylight and is too small (also needs anti-glare coating), (2) lens distortion makes stitching panoramas difficult, (3) chromatic aberration is still too high, (4) lens is too slow at full zoom, (5) \"P\" mode automatic setting for aperture favors wide-open F-2.8 too much of the time, and (6) movie mode lacks decent frame rates at 640x480 resolution.Because the Powershot S70 is still too thick to put in one's shirt pocket or the pants pockets of slacks or jeans, I think having made it thinner than the old S50 accomplished very little (the old S50 fits nicely in coat pockets and the pleated expansion pockets of hiking pants). Instead, the designers should have kept the same thickness as the Powershot S50 and devoted that thickness to a better/faster lens or a mount in front of the lens to add a protective filter. As for the increased capacity of the new NBL-2H battery, I would rather it had been used to power a larger and brighter LCD because I still need to carry around a second battery anyway (even the new batteries don't last a full day of heavy shooting).

The S50 was easier to hold in that respect.  In addition, the S70 uses the same underwater housing as the S60 (WP-DC40), but not the same as the S50 (WP-DC300).

Here is a review on how well they work with the S70.- CF card, at least 1GB in size:  This is a no-brainer must have.  Get a high speed one (but note that Lexar's \"Write Acceleration\" is not supported on Canon cameras).- Canon wide angle lens, and the required lens adaptor:  Not worth it.  The lens doesn't sit very stably on the camera (I expected a more solid feel when using genuine Canon accessories on a Canon camera), and the pictures taken are somewhat distorted.- Wireless controller:  If you have a decent tripod (any brand will do, the S70 accepts a regular tripod screw) and want to be in the pictures you take without resorting to Photoshop, the remote control is a nice thing to have.  But don't expect too much, the zooming control on the remote is pretty much a joke.- Portable dye sublimation printer:  These are marvelous and produce absolutely real-looking (and waterproof too) 4x6 prints that are a world apart from anything inkjet printers can do.  The obvious downsides are 1. paper and color cartridge kits are expensive and 2. 4x6 is the maximum print size.  Other than that, these printers are great fun.  And they are so small these days, you can take one on a trip and print your own postcards to send home.  Canon models are: CP-220, CP-400, CP-330, CP-600 (the later two models include a rechargeable battery, so you don't even need a power source for printing).  Another choice is the Sony DPP-FP30, which is almost as small and has slightly better colors.", "Date": "May 1, 2005"}, {"Title": "There Is NO Comparison-But I DID Do All My Reseach!

Even a few years later I agree, though things in the industry have changed. You simply can't go wrong if you're considering buying this incredibly intelligent and powerful camera-the Canon PowerShot S70 7.1MP Digital Camera with 3.6x Optical Zoom. With so many brands on the market and so many choices, where does one begin to find the right camera for their personal  and professional needs? Where does a photographer or the average enthusiast start to isolate the camera that they want to buy for themselves or as a gift?I really do hope that this personal and honest review will help you narrow your search and help you develop more faith in what you're buying. I'm assuming that you probably have a good deal of experience with photography or you're a person that appreciates great photography. So if you're looking for an outstanding digital camera at a Professional Level, you've found it with this monumental digital camera from Canon. This is a VERY dependable camera, probably in the top of the all the reviews I looked at while doing my homework. If you're a photographer, you know how great it feels to put a great machine in your hands. The Canon Powershot S70 is as sturdy and comfortable as they make them!This camera will always take color-rich and vivid photos for you-even if you make a slight mistake or move your hands just a tiny bit when photographing. It actually has a great deal of technology that is built-in and designed to compensate for anyone who might be in a poor lighting situation or someone who forgets to focus well before shooting the picture. I typically use the function that allows the camera to call all the shots. At first I wasn't comfortable in doing that. After I took my first 2 rolls to the camera store for developing, I soon discovered that I had nothing to worry about and I was dealing with a superb camera.Canon Powershot Digital Cameras are pretty hard to compare with others in the this arena. I've had Powershots for a long time and I've taken over five thousand photos with them-they stand up against my accidental drops or drops of rain when I've exposed the camera to water.Aside for requiring powerful batteries that use a good amount of power, there is no downside to this incredible digital camera from a great digital camera maker. I've been able to have these photographs enlarged to poster size and found them to be as vivid (even close up) as I could ever have imagined. With 7.1 Megapixels, sizes like 8x10's are not even a concern when enlarging.Canon was in the camera business decades before digital cameras were even on the market and they've really pushed the digital envelope with this camera. If you're looking for a gift for someone who is an avid photographer and like digital photography, you've found it in the Powershot S70. You can stop looking and place your order now. Your recipient will be extrememly satisfied with the ease of use and the high quality of this great camera.If you are an avid photographer, like myself, and wish to have a camera for digital shots-this is the baby you'll want to buy! If you're looking to take photographs that you will likely enlarge to 5x7's, 8x10's or larger, this camera has enough power and technology to do the job without looking like a digital photograph. Often my framed digital prints look better than my photographs taken with film-something I never thought would happen!There is a great deal of information that you can read about this camera on the Canon website and other review sites online. You can compare the camera with others in the same category. You might find some slightly better deals with other brands that might offer even larger amounts of Megapixels. That really is NOT what you should be looking for. Often the number of Megapixels is only possible with the use of special software to inerpolate the photographs. You don't want to have to worry about all of that. You are set with the Canon that truly delivers 7.1 VIVID Megapixels!Canon puts together an entire Kit or Package when you buy the Digital Powershot. I wanted to also let you know that the software that's included with the camera package is fantastic and is literally worth the price of the camera in itself. However, you're getting a super package with this deal and a camera that can depend on for as long as you want to own the camera. I've exposed it mine to rain about 10 different times, and I've not EVER had any even a small incidental problem. reminds me of the Energizer Bunny-It just keeps on Going and Going and Going and never stops!

Colors are rich and vibrant.  Camera also haully functional manual controls for the enthusiast.However, this camera has flaws which absolutely ruin an otherwise great product.Negatives:1.)  Subtantial barrelling at widest zoom.  The effect was some of the most pronounced I've ever seen (really evident with indoor close-up flash/nonflash shots).  Of course, as you extend the zoom a little bit, the effect goes away, but for an expensive camera to have this issue where you have to constantly extend the zoom to eliminate this detrimental effect is unforgiveable. Far cheaper cameras don't have this issue...2.)  As with many Canon digital cameras, I noticed the dreaded purple chromatic aberration.  For instance, when you focus on a shaded tree against the blue sky in late afternoon, you can see what I mean by purple halo effect surrounding the branches.  While purple fringing is an issue with digital cameras, the S70 exhibited this problem to a much larger degree than my Olympus C-3000 or Sony DSCW1, which are MUCH, MUCH better in this regard.3.)  Nightime shots are competent, but less vibrant and detailed than others in its price range.4.)  Sliding door needs to go.  Such moving parts will ultimately fail.  It acts sturdy but ultimately it's geared to loosen up to the point where the door mechanism will slide a little and turn the camera off.  Canon:  if you're listening, get rid of these doors  (don't copy the popular Olympus cameras which have this same silly flaw).5.)  Proprietary Li-Ion batteries need to go.  They charge fast and hold a decent charge, but are expensive to replace or to get a spare.  If you run out of juice on a vacation while hiking, for  instance, you can't put a AA in there as you could with its cheaper Powershot brothers.I really wanted to like this camera as it has all the features that I was looking for:  a prosumer camera with sturdy body and LCD screen (plastic cover over LCD is great).However, the flaws of barrelling or purple fringing make this a true deal killer.

I personally accidentally dropped it from hand holding height to the paved bricks sidewalk and amazingly it survived with only a slight tiny scratch to the body.", "Date": "January 6, 2013"}, {"Title": "Nice camera", "Author": "Maymom small biz team", "ReviewID": "RX8QI73F5M7WK", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Nothing to complain, except slightly heavy and bulky (not too much though).

I have had zero problems with it, and have nothing but the best things to say about it's photo capabilities.I think that this is the best balance of quality for the price. Besides, you don't need more than 7.1 mp for any photography. If I shot photos in the full 7.1 mp I could make life size posters!The true test for this camera (to me) was when I went on vacation up the California coast. I shot the most amazing pictures in Big Sur. The detail was exquisite, and the color was amazing. Since I have purchased this camera, my PhotoShop days have been over. I never have to adjust the color of any shot I take, and that is why I love this camera so much.If you are looking for a camera that has the capabilities of an SLR without the size of an SLR, this is definitely the one to get.", "Date": "June 6, 2006"}, {"Title": "Canon S-70 is NOT worth more than $300max!!", "Author": "Tekon", "ReviewID": "R20RDM7IJVS0OA", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "It was a descent camera at the time. I bought it in 2005 for about $390 something from BuyDig(finally a place that gave me no hassle, or the ussual run around.)With wide angle lens, sliding lens cover. But here's what I learned: The slider is flimsy, and comes off of it's sliding rails sometimes, it doesn't do too well in low light. Forget about trying to take a candle lit shot of an altar. I ended up taping a piece of tissue to compensate for the overly bright flash. Above 100iso setting things tend to get rather grainy. This is a very sensitive and finicky camera to work with, you can have it on a setting that you like and as soon as you close the clam shell your setting disappears, and you're back to the default settings that may or may not work for you. Also the mode dial moves too easily, so you gotta be careful when you pull it out of your bag.So save yourself the money. Because if you were to look on current market for point & Shoot digi cam, you'll find other cameras that are (1)cheaper, with (2)higher mega pixel counts, (3)Built in image stabilization/vibration reduction etc. (4)Slimmer body(so you don't look like you're overly excited, or have a pet gerbil hiding in your pants)Finally, if you've been shooting film SLR you probably won't be satisfied with most digicam unless you're getting Nikon D3, or Canon EOS-1Ds MkIII.Because unlike film cameras, the processor in those little digicam decides almost everything if it doesn't live up to standards you're stuck! ...with grainy, unnaturally color balanced images.", "Date": "March 11, 2008"}, {"Title": "Great for a portable 7 MP camera", "Author": "Digital Yogi", "ReviewID": "R1I169RFE41R3A", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I have done quite a research on the portable 7MP cameras (especially the ones that supports add on lens) and this S70 stands out.

I've always owned Nikon products personally, but the features for the price of the S70 swayed me away from my usual Nikon brand loyalty.  In the 12 months I've had the S70, it's been sent to the factory twice for repairs--the second time was just 6 days before the warranty expired.  The first time it was sent in was because the lens door failed to turn on the camera and it was almost to come off of its track.  Eight months later, the flash quit working in all modes AND the door was failing AGAIN!The flash and door problem occurred while I was in Yosemite NP, so you can imagine the disappointment in being in a place like that with a camera that is only half functioning.Now, the warranty is expired and I hold my breath every time I slide the lens door open.
