{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Very poor in low light", "Author": "D. Heatherington", "ReviewID": "R5OE8QKFAEPUJ", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "Normally video cameras have automatic gain control that turns up the sensitivity in low light.  This camera does the opposite.  In any light lower than bright office light it produces very dark and noisy pictures.  In fact, instead of turning up the gain in low light it turns it down.  I pointed it at a slightly dark area and then slid in a white piece of paper to see how the extra bright area affected the rest of the picture.  A normal camera will reduce the gain when a bright object in introduced into the scene.  In this case the background should have gotten darker when the white paper was put in the scene. But, it got brighter!  It turns up the gain when the light level goes up!  Either this camera was defective or it has a serious design flaw.  In any case I'm returning it for a refund.", "Date": "November 18, 2010"}, {"Title": "It worked fine while it lasted", "Author": "e2e4 \"e2e4\"", "ReviewID": "R2A77L1J76QSNG", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "I couldn't really see how this cam works, because I dropped it from about 2 feet and it stopped working properly.Be careful, this thing is fragile..too fragile I might say. Despite my general knowledge about electronics, I couldn't bring it back on line.Something went wrong with the ccd. From what i got to see, the angle of view is narrow, about 60 degrees.Receiver works ok.I guess for the money (around $50) seems like an ok product.", "Date": "July 28, 2010"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": null, "Features": null, "Name": null, "ImgURL": null, "ProductID": "B000UY4MF0"}}
