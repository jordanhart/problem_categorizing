(LZ1 review since there are none for LZ2)", "Author": "Sandy Gardener \"Sandy\"", "ReviewID": "R3PZHJOF7KC9SF", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I've known what I wanted in a digital camera for several years:1. Fast shutter release (my Canon S-200 takes 3+ sec., 5+ flash).2. Small and light (for backpacking, travel).3. Point and shoot zoom(5X plus with image stabilization).4. 4+ megapixel, under $250.5. No proprietary batteries, 2 AA preferred.Up until now, nothing has come close. Then I read in Business Week that the LZ1 and LZ2 had become the best selling cameras in Japan within several months of their introduction. No independant reviews were available (even CNET) so I bought the LZ1 on the strength of it's technical spec's and my previous experiences with Panasonic products.I took the LZ1 to the rodeo several days ago to test it under demanding conditions. I used the \"sports\" setting and burst mode(four exposures in about 1 1/2 seconds under those circumstances), all freehand. The results were stunning! No noticeable shutter lag, no blurry or out of focus pictures, all action frozen. Simply put: point, shoot, you got it!Notes: Actual weight with 2 batteries is 8.2 ozs. The user interface is the best I've seen- full functioned and simple. Flash shots have shutter lag of approx. 1/2 second. I use Panasonic 2300 mah nmh rechargeable batteries purchased at Costco. Panasonic specs claim 370 pictures with those batteries, 30 seconds between shots, flash every shot, full zoom in and out each shot. This camera has no optical view finder. I use a 512mb Sandisc Ultra II SD memory card- a little more expensive, but after having a Viking card quit and swallow 200 pics on another camera, I don't pinch pennies on memory.", "Date": "May 9, 2005"}, {"Title": "One Great Camera!", "Author": "PainterGirl", "ReviewID": "ROVG0OB4W5WGV", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This is one great camera!  I also have a Canon Powershot A75, so I have another great camera to compare it to.  I thought the Powershot took excellent pictures until I got the Panasonic DMC-LZ2.  The LZ2's pictures are even better.  The 6x optical zoom is one of the reasons I wanted the LZ2, and it works great!  I took some pictures of my kids racing (swimming) in the pool using Auto, and they came out beautifully.  They were not blurry at all, and you can even see the splashes of water in the air. I thought they might be blurry since I didn't use the \"Sports\" mode, but they were not.  I also took several pictures of them from about 100 feet away and zoomed in the whole way with the optical zoom.  The pictures are very close, clear, and look terrific.

The cameras I was considering and why I didn't buy them were:Canon SD400-Pretty pricey, reports of a fragile LCD and proprietary batteries.  Also test pix on various review sites from the panasonic seemed to be better.Canon A520-Only 4mp's and when I went into best buy to play with it I couldn't figure out how to turn off the flash.  If you have to fiddle with a camera for the first time and 15 minutes later you figure out how to shut off the flash, I shudder to think how hard the other features might be to figure out.  Granted, I didn't look at the manual, but some features should just be easy to do.  Plus I think it was too much camera. More options then I need as a simple point and shoot photographer.Kodak C360-Good price point and nice features but has a proprietary USB cable and batteries.  Also some complaints about low light photography.  Also, little leary about buying first year models.As for the Panasonic itself I'm happy with my purchase.  I bought a 512 mb SD Ultra II card as well.  When it arrived, I put the batteries in, and started taking pix.  It was a sense of euphoria, I just was snapping away, and when I came to a picture I didn't like, delete it and \"poof\" it was gone.  The camera is performing flawlessly.  It does have it's downfalls, and they are stated by other reviewers these are my negatives:Movie Mode: The movies at 30fps are good enough for me, but I have a digital video camera, and to be honest, the movies are not a must in a digital camera.LCD:  The resolution to my untrained eye is not notieceable.  The pix look good when I review them.  However, in bright direct sunlight I do have to cup my hand over it too see it.  Took me a while to figure out that if I just rotated my body to form a shadow on the camera that worked great!No optical viewfinder:  Ok, I admit it, for the first 50 shots or so, I kept bringing the camera up to my face, bumping my nose in a futile search for a viewfinder.  Took me a couple of days to stop doing this learned response after years with a 35mm Camera.  No viewfiner is not that bad, but in direct sunlight, it is a little difficult to see the shot and then take it, but overall, not that bad.Indoor/Low Light Photography:  Works great with the flash as long as objects are within the flash range, which, if you are indoors that should be fine.  Now I haven't taken it too a large indoor arena or anything, but most of those type of events are lit pretty well aren't they?  In dimlight and the object is a distance away, you do have to kinda guess when framing up the photo but it doesn't take long to figure it out and I haven't had that much problem.Overall:  A good camera, the burst mode is great!!!! and the 6x zoom with the Image Stabilization, awesome.  It can't be understated how HUGE that feature is.  I'm glad I chose this camera over the others in hindsight.  I now send my photo's to costco via the internet to develop what I want, which is awesome.  If you're a first timer to Digital Photography, this is a great camera for you.Take Care,  Sean", "Date": "September 29, 2005"}, {"Title": "Great Little Camera!", "Author": "J. Estes \"Jeff\"", "ReviewID": "R1V37OAMJEKFJ2", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I've been an avid 35mm user, and wanted to take the plunge into digital, but didn't want to spend a lot of money. What got me interested in the LZ2 were the reviews on other Web sites with example photos, and comparisons with other cameras. I have to tell you, I'm not disappointed! The controls are very easy to find & use, and I don't miss the viewfinder like I thought I would; the LCD is big and bright enough, even outdoors here in Phoenix. Plus, even though I use reading glasses, I can get by without them to use this camera, as the controls & menu are well-organized and easy to read.The LZ2 has no manual capabilities, which is typical for this price range. However, you can make up for it to some degree by using things like \"Sports\" mode when you want a faster relative shutter release, etc. It also allows for changing color mode, which gets rid of the yellow effect of incandescent lights and things of that nature.Close-up shots are flawless, and long-distance shots with the 6x optical zoom are crystal clear, even when enlarged 200%. Digital zoom has a lot of noise, and is best reserved for when using a tripod. For all pictures, the LZ2 has image stabilizer to help reduce blurring from camera shake. It's better than nothing, but the best way to hold a camera steady is to lean it against something, or use a tripod. That's the problem with LCD-only cameras -- it's difficult to hold anything steady when when you have to hold it out away from your body.Image quality is sharp with well-saturated colors, normal for digital cameras. Also typical is a very narrow exposure gradient -- When shooting in bright sunlight, shadows come out very dark; the LZ2 is better than most of the digital images I've seen, but still not on par with film images. In any case, for the price range, the images it takes are are excellent.Battery life is excellent, provided you throw away the \"Oxyride\" batteries it comes with and put in some Alkaline or rechargeable NiMH instead. The Oxyride are worthless; they gave out after 20 shots, but the generic Alkaline I replaced them with have 70 or more and haven't given me the 1/2-full notice yet.It comes with software for image editing, but if you're using Windows XP all you have to do is hook it up via the USB cable and Windows reads immediately it like any other removable drive. For editing, I use Photoshop, and haven't had a chance to try the bundled software yet. With all the image-editing software available, don't let the bundled software of this or any other camera sway you; there's a LOT to choose from out there.Pros:* 6x Optical zoom, with 4x digital* Compact & light weight -- you can drop it in a pocket or purse and take it anywhere.* Big & bright LCD screen.* Uses 2 AA batteries, which can be found anywhere, cheap.* Long battery life, even using zoom & flash.* Can hook it up to a PC or a TV for viewing images.* Very convenient (for me) location of controls and ease of use.* Lots of menu options.* Very sharp images, even with enlarging.* Good skin tones for portraits, with or without flash.* Power-save mode: Can be set to go on standby if no activity for 1-2 minutes.Cons:* No manual controls.* Limited autofocus accuracy in low light. This is exacerbated by the fact that there is no manual control capability.* On-board memory is only 14MB. However, most people opt for the extra cards anyway. In my case, a 512MB SD chip will store over 200 high-res images, depending on the light.* Flash doesn't diminish enough when using Macro settings; it's plenty bright for everything else.* Digital zoom is very grainy, but the 6x Optical makes up for it.Overall, this is the best little \"fun\" camera I've seen, and with its light weight and ease of use, I can take it anywhere.

I love Olympus but they and Fuji were knocked out of the running due to their use of xD cards.  I also like using AA NiMH so that was a requirement as well... goodbye proprietary batteries.  I wasn't really enthralled with the plethora of 3x lenses and am a fan of image stabilization so decided to give Panasonic a try.I'm very happy after about 500 photos.  I try to remember to manually set the ISO because at the higher speeds, the noise is very noticeable.  The Image Stabilization system rocks... it's unbelievable how sharp the pictures can be at higher focal lengths and low shutter speeds. The size is great... although if you don't want the longer lens, certainly there are smaller cameras.  Exposures are good and if you need to manually adjust based on the playback, it is easy to do.I don't miss the optical viewfinder at all... the LCD on the back is large and easy to use.  In extreme sunlight, you sometimes find yourself guessing or trying to shade the viewfinder, but it works extremely well.Pros:- SD card, std AA batteries, long battery life.- good optics (can not be overemphasized) with a 6x range.- Image stabilization works extremely well- good color, white balance- nice size for the features- LCD viewfinder works well- Menu system well done, commonly used features are one button push away- unprocessed images look good out of the camera (although a little Photoshop can improve anything)- Like the HDTV mode since I believe my future HD television will be the primary way that I enjoy pictures in the future.  This makes pictures the \"right size\" for 1020 viewing- Simple enough to use right out of the box (I'll read the manual sometime)- Camera and controls have a good feel (like all quality cameras)- Great value for those looking for >135mm focal length.- Little shutter lag for single shotsCons:- A little bulkier than other 5MP cameras- LCD does not twist and turn which is a great feature on the Canon A95.  You have to be behind the camera to see what's in the frame.- More noise at high ISO settings (200, 400) than I like but I really don't know how the Panasonic compares to others in this regard- Dynamic Range not as good as professional cameras but am not sure how Panasonic compares to others in this regard.- flash recycle time", "Date": "July 10, 2005"}, {"Title": "A lot of camera for a reasonable price !!", "Author": "G. Mess \"gmess24\"", "ReviewID": "R2UA8LGE05ACIO", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "WOW .........  this would be the one word to describe this camera.  This camera had almost everything I was looking for at a price that is very competitive with other brands. I was looking for something that was semi-small, had a good optical zoom (at least 4x +), at least 5mp, and that was below $250.00. This was one of the few camera's to meet all my criteria.The optical zoom on this is amazing for a compact camera, while most in this category are a 3x optical, this gives you 6x. The optical image stabilization is an awesome feature, usually found only in more expensive camera's. Even while skaking it up and down, it still delivers a crisp, detailed picture (yep, I tried it for fun) This feature in a compact camera was unique only to Panasonic. Both the 6x optical zoom, and the optical image stabilization deliver as promised. The digital zoom is somewhat noisy, and tends to not be as high definition, but this is true of all digital zooms, and for most situations the 6x optical is more than enough.Lag time between photos is about average, but still could stand to be a little quicker. This is especially true when using the flash. This is one downside of digital camera's, that I expect in newer generations will not be a problem. The 5mp is more than enough for good quality prints.The Camera itself is slightly (very slightly) a bit bigger than others in it's class, but this is neccesary to add the increased features. You could fit this inot a pocket if needed, but overall it is too bulky for this. It's all plastic body does not appear or feel cheaply made. I do wish they would have used some metal, but overall this keeps the camera weight down.Features are very user friendly for a novice (such as myself), and the camera interface is very easy to learn and use. Buttons are well laid out, and for the most part are similiar to all digital camera's.The lack of an optical view finder does take some getting used too, but you will find you do not miss it at all after only a few hours. The LCD screen is large (2\") and the picture is clear and bright. The only trouble I have experienced is in darker situations it can be hard to compose the picture, but this is also true of all LCD's.The built in memory is small, only good for a handful of pictures.I would recommend purchasing an SD card no smaller than 125mb, but if price is not a factor go for a 512mb or higher.I am not one on technical aspects, but the camera does give a user some choice over photo layouts, but for the most part is a simple to use point and shoot camera, with many extra useful bells and whistles. So far I am very pleased with this camera, it performs remarkable, had all the features I was looking for, and will not be obsolete in a few months.Pro's- 6x optical zoom (cannot say enough about it)- optical image stabilization ( a selling point alone)- Well laid out, easy to use interface- Large LCD screen- Crisp, clear pictures- Histogram (checks exposure, and lets you know when it is correct)- Beats all camera's in it's price range hands down on features- Uses AA batteries, and not a properitary battery. ( I did not think I would like this, but AA's are easy to find, and the rechargeable's are modestly priced compared to other batteries.Con's- Slightly bigger than most competitors- Average picture lag time between shots, especially when using the flash- No speaker to hear recorded video- lack of optical viewfinder ( not really a con in some cases)In all if you are looking for a great camera, with many extra features not usually found in this price range, this is the camera for you. This camera would suit an enthusiast who is looking for a small back up camera, or a beginner who wants a nice camera for everday snapshot pictures.

For the range of price you wouldn't find a 5MP piece with a 6X and that picture quality. Further more, if you want to add the 4X digital zoom (not recommended) there it is giving the total 24x. I recently used it at the Champ Car Grand Prix in Mexico City and I took wonderful pictures. The stabilizer function works well and I happen to get the most of the burst mode (it takes about 2 pics. per second) while there was a pit stop so I captured around 12 pictures in those seconds. I was a pit official so I had to check later no irregularities to the rulebook and was great! I think in the real world you can capture those moments when the kids are blowing away the candles of the birthday cake. Imagine the scenes you can capture at a rate of 2 pictures/second (not with the flash on).The setbacks are it has lots of functions (read the manual, that's what it is intended for, didn't it?). No viewfinder (you'll only miss it at very bright days). Buy a rechargeable set of NmH batteries, you'll save a lot! Excellent quality. I printed some pictures taken at the highest resolution on an Epson plotter at a size of almost A3 and were great!Memory fact: I ordered along a Kingston 512 MB module.

I went to Circuit City and tested it in my own hands and then decided that I should give Panaonic a chance. I am glad that I did! The buttons are very easy to understand and navigate. The lag time between shots is not as bad as some other reviewers have mentioned. Only when you use the flash, it needs about 2-3 seconds to recharge. But then again, that is the case for alot of other cameras. I take indoor photos alot, when I use my Sony, the flash gives certain area of the image super bright and the background dark. This camera actually gives it a very even exposure. The pictures come out very natural. The AA batteries are a big plus for I can carry a spare set easily. The power consumption is very good! The LCD is bright and clear. And of course the motion stablizer really works!! It is not a pocket size, but it is light weight and easy to carry with you. I want to mention this camera is MADE IN JAPAN! I don't trust high end electonic stuff to be made in China. Japan is still the only country of manufacturer I truly trust.

Panasonic cameras were not nearly as popular as Sony's Mavica line, but now Panasonic digital cameras are among the best reviewed cameras on the market - and well known for quality optics. Panasonic is also one of the few camera manufacturers to produce products in their home country, Japan.The Panasonic LZ2 may be budget priced, but it offers anything but budget performance. Having tried a host of other point-and-shoot cameras ranging from the highly overrated Fuji FinePix F10 to the Olympus SP-350, I can say with confidence that the LZ two is more likely to produce a greater percentage of useable images than many of its competitors. The secret? Panasonic's entire digital camera line offers image stabilization, not the ineffective high-ISO, high-shutter substitute used by other manufacturers. Moreover, unlike the other cameras I tested, the LZ2 focuses much faster - also a trait of my six-year-old 1.3MP Panasonic - and it does so even in dim light without using one of those startling AF assist lamps. Because the LZ2's auto focus is almost always accurate, I spend less time refocusing and more time snapping pictures. Better yet, battery options are varied enough to keep the camera going just about anywhere: it accepts AA batteries, Oxyride and rechargeable (the best choice being the highest rated rechargeable you can find).After nearly 1,000 photos, including some shot out of the window of a moving car, I can say that this camera is a point-and-shooter's dream.  And you don't have to be a digital camera newbie to enjoy it, either. The LZ2 isn't bulky or heavy like prosumer models and isn't as costly as much of its competition, yet it packs 6X optical zoom - 3x higher than average - into a body small enough to carry in a purse.What gives this camera an edge is its performance in full auto mode. Whereas the cameras I tested work best after manual settings are engaged, this camera does not suffer without full manual controls. Picture adjustment - Natural, Standard and Vivid - allow you to obtain desired color results; auto exposure is sufficient to eliminate much of the highlight clipping common to point-and-shoot CCD cameras; \"purple fringing\" is rarely an issue even in direct midday sun; and eight pre-configured scene modes - including one for tricky low-light indoor shots - will keep your choices useful rather than overwhelming; ISOs through 400 are useable; there are four focus modes; color effects include monochrome, sepia, warm and cool cast; a histogram can be viewed on-screen at all times; a nine-square image composition overlay rounds out the LZ2's assets; and  exposure compensation - on the rare occasion it is needed - is handy at the touch of a button, which means no digging through menus. Finally, the LZ2's white balance is highly effective when set to any one of its five choices, from manual WB to indoor or out.Where it counts most - image quality - this camera delivers. The LZ2 reproduces color so accurately in \"Natural\" mode and meters so consistently that little image correction, if any, is necessary - meaning you can plug the camera directly into a PictBridge-compatible printer and bypass your computer entirely without regretting it. This makes the LZ2 suited for people who want to print album-sized prints up to 8x10 at the touch of a button.What's not to love about the LZ2? If I had to pick just one gripe it is that the flash does not \"throttle down\" enough for close-up shots in macro mode. I consistently washed out the color and detail in my birds' feathering - until an easy solution presented itself. Take a bit of ordinary tape - the translucent foggy type - and affix it to the front of the LZ2's tiny flash bulb. Remove when done. If not for this minor inconvenience, I would have rated the LZ2 as a 5-star performer in the digital point-and-shoot camera category.Having read the reviews, some readers may ask if the LZ2's images are on the noisy side. In my experience the noise is not an issue and won't be for most people who print low ISO images at or below 8x10.  A more compelling concern, in my opinion, is the over-aggressive noise reduction many consumer-level cameras employ to smooth out images for an airbrushed, albeit artificial look. Keep in mind that if noise is a problem you can always reduce it in post-processing using widely available software. By contrast, even the most expensive, up-to-date version of Photoshop will not replace detail where it has been previously obliterated by in-camera processing. To their credit, Panasonic digital cameras generally avoid the rampant noise-phobia that exists in the digital camera marketplace - with the end result being sharper overall images that retain more of a film-like character.", "Date": "April 22, 2006"}, {"Title": "Excellent value", "Author": "Aks", "ReviewID": "R1TQ2EF0RH25O7", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "This camera is great value for the money.

I also use it for situations when it isn't convenient to carry a large camera bag around with me. I use a Nikon CoolPix 8800 which is a fantastic camera but is heavy, bulky and designed for the very serious amateur photographer. The LZ2 was the best value around for compact cameras in terms of features. What turned me on the most was 5 megapixels, 6:1 optical zoom, and image stabilization. No other compact camera has all 3 features. Don't underestimate the value of image stabilization. I ran some tests at max zoom with it in \"Off\", in \"Position 1\", and in \"Position 2\". The results were quite dramatic and \"Position 2\" was clearly the best. The \"Macro\" setting works quite well for taking closeups of flowers.By far the biggest drawback of this camera is the lack of an optical viewfinder, particularly when outdoors in bright light. The built-in flash is also undersized and has a limited reach. There is also no infra red illumination for focussing under dim light conditions. One plus is that the LZ2 uses AA batteries. I bought a trickle charger and 10 rechargeable 2300 mAh Ni-Mh batteries on eBay to eliminate the expense of using throwaway batteries. All purchases involve compromise and cameras are no different than vehicles. This will be a great little camera for a great many photographers but obviously there are far better but much larger cameras available at much higher prices.

Most of my photos have been shot at lower pixels(2MP or less) for ease of e-mailing, but even those have been excellent quality.

I picked up a high-speed 1GB SD card for $60 online that claims to hold about 500 pictures at high resolution.", "Date": "October 3, 2005"}, {"Title": "May be better.", "Author": "Igor Zaychik \"We love it.\"", "ReviewID": "R10ZG2708G2EHM", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "Just replaced my Minolta E323 for LZ2.I was really surprised by perfect qualityof some of my pictures in a simple auto mode.But 5-6x zoom results are really frustrated.Pictures are not clear, wery grainy andnot focused. 5MP are doing the job, if youprint a 5x6 or smaller pictures you willnot see these problems but if you want tomake a wallpaper it is not OK.Red eyes seems does not work.So, LZ2 is a regular point end shoot camerawith better to say 4x optical zoom (5-6x may bepractical outdoor on open space).Colors are not perfect but you can play withwhite balance, compensation and normal, natural, vividcolor modes.Indeed with better color and bigger sensor may kickCanon's current point and shoot line.", "Date": "September 4, 2005"}, {"Title": "Don't buy this camera", "Author": "freezerjam \"freezerjam\"", "ReviewID": "RF3SP3HYZOLY8", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "Don't buy this camera (Panasonic LZ2) if you ever intend to take pictures outdoors.

I spent about an hour reading over the manual and making sure I knew how to use all the bells and whistles.  The camera has a lot of very nice little features and takes beautiful pictures, and the LCD and options are awesome.  BUT!!  the camera has one critical flaw .... it is super delicate.  I have owned several Sony digital cameras and they all have shared their fair share of bumps and bruises, and came out continueing to shoot away.  This little piece sustained a very small impact and the lens would no longer extend and retract.  I litteraly had this camera for 90 minutes before it was rendered inoperable.  I was fuming.The bottom line of this camera is that it has a lot of neat gagets, but you have to treat it like your wife's China or it becomes an expensive paper weight.", "Date": "June 25, 2005"}, {"Title": "Don't Waste Your Time!", "Author": "A.

I have now heard others stories about the durability of this camera that is not involving sand....sure it has a great price for so many good features, but it will die fast if you do very much with it. stear away, pay more for a more durable camera with the features you want", "Date": "October 5, 2005"}, {"Title": "Cumple lo prometido", "Author": "Sabas Monroy Martinez", "ReviewID": "R193MQ1YSXHL5H", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Junto a mi esposa guardamos afici\u00f3n a la fotograf\u00eda sin ser en lo absoluto profesionales en la materia.
