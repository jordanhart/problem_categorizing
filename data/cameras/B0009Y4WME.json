{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Not without flaws, but the best ultracompact for the price", "Author": "Ryan Harvey", "ReviewID": "RNCYKOHCTVJ3N", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I've had about seven digital cameras now, and this one is my favorite of the bunch.Pros:- Excellent picture quality.  In my opinion, Kodaks take the best digital pictures of all point and shoot cameras.  Colors are bold and bright, and daytime pictures don't get washed out.- Very compact size.  Sexy and stylish.  Fits easily into your jeans pocket.- Many picture-taking modes for daytime, nighttime, moving objects, close-ups, portraits, etc.- If you use a desktop computer, the dock comes in handy and provides a convenient place to store the camera and charge it.- Video quality is superb.  By far, the best I've seen on a point-and-shoot camera.Cons:- The zoom buttons on the back of the camera, combined with the camera's small size, make it impossible to zoom and take a picture with one hand.  I miss the zoom dial on the front, operated with the index finger rather than the thumb, on my older, bulkier Kodak.  With this camera, if you zoom, you have to use two hands.- You have to use the dock, and have it plugged into a wall outlet, to transfer pictures to your computer.  I think this is pretty silly.  No way to just connect the camera itself to your computer, or to transfer pictures without a wall outlet nearby. This also makes it impossible to charge your camera by plugging it into your computer with the USB cord.- Speaking of the dock, it's pretty cumbersome if you use a laptop (i.e., if you don't use your computer in the same place all the time).- Camera can easily get lost because it's so small.  I can't find mine right now.  I suspect it's in a pocket somewhere.- No viewfinder.  You have to aim your shots using the screen on the back.- Small buttons on back make for somewhat clumsy navigation.Overall, I'm happy with this camera.  It's a hundred dollars cheaper than the V550, and the only feature difference I can discern is the smaller screen in the back.  It takes good pictures.  I can't comment on the Kodak software because I use Picasa, which you can download for free and is far superior to anything else on the market.  Hope this is helpful; happy shopping!", "Date": "April 8, 2006"}, {"Title": "Simply an Amazing Camera....Period", "Author": "Caesu", "ReviewID": "R24UZB0EBTOB0G", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This camera is just amazing.  Im a very stingy buyer.  I want what Im looking for and I look for the best value on top.  The Kodak V530 is probably the best camera for its price I have ever had my hands on.  Its LCD screen is large and very high quality.  The images and movies play back on a very high resoultion screen with a high frames per second speed time.The camera picture quality is very sharp and natural.  I took home the Canon 5megapixel equivalent for comparison.  although that camera was fast and very solid, the pictures were sharp but the images comparably to what you see naturally looked somewhat artificially enhanced.  The built in lcd screen was choppy, grainy and not comparable to the kodak.Movie mode is beyond nice on the Kodak V530.  A 1gb SD card makes nearly 30 min of 640x480 movie at 30fps.  Its tv quality and its a great thing to use on day trips where you do not want to bring a camcorder entirely.The dock can play the videos/pictures straight to TV and connects to a computer through a USB 2.0 port.  Very nice.I have never seen a digital camera with movie quality this good.  Period.  The aforementioed Canon had a good movie mode too, but its compression was horrendous.  You could only make 1/3 the length for the same amount of memory.Buy this Kodak, you will not regret it.5 stars ++++", "Date": "November 5, 2005"}, {"Title": "Cute and Sexy camera", "Author": "Nee", "ReviewID": "R2PPMS1CSVCCD9", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Appearance: I bought the silver color.  It is small and sexy. It definately has a wow factor. The base looks futuristic, yet the round shape is useful for turning it around.

I was a little confused with playing videos on the tv, but within a minute I got it to work.Picture Quality:  My pictures look great, even on 1.8MP.  There are plenty of different settings for taking pictures.After I ordered this camera, I wondered if I should have bought the v550 instead.  But after I received it, I felt good about my purchase.  The two cameras are pretty much the same except for the bigger LCD, more memory and a viewfinder.  A bigger LCD just wastes more battery, and 2\" is more than adequate.  Built-in memory doesn't matter because everybody buys their own anyway.  And using a viewfinder just takes the fun out of taking digital pics.  Viewfinders are not too accurate anyway.  Oh, and the v530 is SMALLER than the v550.

It is very compact and well built with an aluminum shell rather than plastic. The buttons are a little small, but they are sturdy and click well. The lcd is big enough for clarity, it is bright and detailed, with very good color fidelity and contrast. The menus are very easy and intuitive to navigate and the amount of buit-in flexible features are amazing. But where this camera really shines is the quality of the pictures. Some people have complained that indoor or lowlight pics come out too dark, I have to disagree with that, I found that pics requiring the flash were bright enough to illuminate all the necessary subject's details. The biggest surprise for me was the excellent video capabilites of this camera. You literally don't need a camcorder anymore. This camera's video quality is comparable to vhs and it is smooth and colorful with a built-in stabilization feature which eliminates any shaky moving images. The sound is also loud and clear and a 1gb card can hold up to about 30 minutes at 640x480 or 60 minutes at 320x240 (at this lower resolution the loss of quality is minor and the image still looks very good). Another thing, you can hook up the camera to a tv or vcr and you can view the pictures or videos on them. the tv image is clear, with excellent color fidelity, brightness and contrast ratio, you can even record the video (and/or just the pictures) on a vhs tape and make your own home movies. I still feel that A regular film camera gives a better more realistic picture than any digital ones, but nevertheless as far as digital goes, this is the one. Whatelse can you expect from a digital camera this small and inexpensive?.

For the price ((...)) you really get a lot of features. When I show it to people they kind of laugh at it's size but soon stop laughing when they see what it can do. But first the drawbacks. You need a really big memory card or a lot of little ones to do video. I put a 512mb in it and it will only take about 14 minutes of video at high resolution. And video is one reason I bought it(it does video at 30 fps which is way faster than almost all cameras in the 200 dollar price range). Most cameras in this price range do high resolution video at 10 -14 frames per second so fast action video looks like stop action on other cameras. Secondly, you can only charge the battery while in the camera with the included Dock/charger but you can buy a charger for about $25 that will do this. The battery is not very strong(it will only last for about 120 pictures before needing charging). But I did do 50 minutes of video and took 50 pictures on one charge with power left and it only took about 1.5 hours to recharge the battery. I have yet to find a way to turn off the terrible digital zoom(digital zoom is no good on any camera - Why they put it on anything is beyond me. You can hear the zoom on playback of video. Of course there are other little nuisances here and there but all cameras have them. And now, SOME of the good.  1. It's light and cute( I keep thinking about Mission Impossible), you can take video and most people don't realize they are being videoed, Ha, ha, because the thing looks too small to do video, especially high qualty 30 fps.  2. The controls (buttons) are a lot simpler than that wheel on other Kodaks, especially when going back and forth from video to stills.  3. TV quality video(30 fps). No blurred or stop motion effects when recording fast action.  4. The large LCD(2 inches) is very clear and easy to see.It is viewable from 170 degrees in any direction and no other camera I tried could do this. They all went dark or way light when viewed from anywhere but straight on. This featute is a home run.  5. It has a speaker so you can listen to your video sound from the camera on playback.  6. You can stop, pause, and fast rewind and forward the video on the camera playback.  7. Simple, simple, simple to operate.  8. You can zoom during video recording although as I said before, it is audible on playback. It's not that loud, you can barely hear it if people are talking.  8.

The price point for the features and perfomance of the camera cannot be beat.I took this camera earlier this month on a 16 day cruise across the Atlantic and on to a land tour of France, England and Scotland.In Scotland I slipped into some rapids and was thrust over a small waterfall,etc. The Kodak V530 was in my shirt pocket and underwater (rushing water I might add) for about ten minutes.  I was clinging for dear life with the only handhold and foothold I could find which both happend to be for my left hand and foot. As I was waiting for help I rememberd my camera and reached with my free hand to pull it out from underwater and threw it to someone on shore.I really had no hope for the camera but was hoping to salvage my 1 gig secure digital card with over 400 photos from my trip.Unbelievably after drying out all day and then me running the hair dryer over it for five minutes or so back at the hotel the Kodak V530 came back to life and has worked as good as new since then. Now it may prematurely rust or something but right now it is what I consider the miracle camera. The only thing I had done was to almost immediately take the battery and SD card out to dry seperately.As far as performance goes from a cold start to taking your first pic the camera will come on and the lens extend all in about two seconds!

The following criteria were most important to me: price, quality, and reliability.  Now, before I start reviewing this camera, I want to mention that I have some professional photography experience.  I used to work for Kodak for a couple of years in Professional Digital Imaging department, doing some software testing.  I don't consider myself to be a Pro, but I do know what I'm talking about when it comes to cameras, and digital cameras/photography in particular.  Having said that, I never had a Kodak camera before, and I thought I'd give a try.  Was that a mistake!  Here is why:The Good:Design - This was probably one of the reasons why I bought this camera in the first place - it's cool looking design.  Very sleek.  Very compact.  Very attractive.Price - Another good thing about this camera is its price.  I picked it up at Walmart for [...]  Not a bad deal, considering you are buying a 5MP digital camera by a well known brand.The Bad:Picture Quality - To simply put it - it sucks!  Yes, you heard me.  I am not sure how people get quality pictures with this camera.  Tweaking different parameters, changing modes, etc. did not help one bit.  I was very disappointed, especially after reading numerous positive reviews.Flash - Weak.  Very weak.  You have to be very close to the object to get any use out of the flash on this camera.Software - Why in the world would I need so much junk on my computer?!  All I want is to just transfer my pictures from camera onto my computer.  That's it.  Plain and simple.  But no, Kodak wants you to install their software, that is not only takes up a lot of space and pretty much useless, but also is full of bugs.The Ugly:Battery Life - In one word - horrible!!!  I think it took about half an hour of taking pictures/playing with the camera, for a red warning light to appear.  If for some strange reason you are still thinking about buying this camera, do yourself a huge favor and get a backup battery.Modes/Parameters - I've saved the \"best\" for last.  This camera is supposed to be a P&S; (point and shoot) type of camera.  Well, since the default settings did not produce a good quality picture, I started \"playing\" with various modes, i.e. ISO, resolution, etc.  Imagine my surprise when I realized that once the camera is turned off, and then turned on again, it looses all of your manual settings and changes everything back to default.  What a piece of junk!  Amazing.  No other camera that I know of does that.  Junk!!!Summary:It might seem like a good choice, especially considering the price, but unfortunately it lacks performance.  I strongly recommend to stay away from this camera.Now, if you are still reading this, I have a few suggestions:Like I mentioned before, I was looking for a good replacement to my Canon.  I didn't want to buy another Canon, because I think they are overrated and overpriced.  I like Sony - I think their video equipment is one of the best on the market, but unfortunately the same doesn't apply to their digital cameras.  So, using specific parameters/criteria I've narrowed down my search to a few brands/models: Kodak V530/V550, Panasonic FX8/FX9, and Casio S600/Z600/Z60 (I was also looking at Z750 and Z850).  Kodak turned out to be a waste of my time - two days after I bought it, I took it back to Walmart (thanks to their great return policy - no restocking fees or anything else).  I am not even going to try V550, because it's basically the same as V530, with a bigger LCD (display), and an optical viewfinder (the little peephole that you are looking through when you take a shot).  I wish I could try Panasonic, since it uses Leica lenses, which supposed to be the best of the best.  Unfortunately, none of the local stores carry those models, and I didn't want to buy it online, since there are always restocking fees (if you don't like it and want to return it, the company will charge you anything from 10% to 20% for an open box).  So, I went back to Walmart to see what else they've got.  That's how I discovered Casio Exilim EX-Z60, which is a newly released camera, an alternative to their Z600 model.  To make a long story short, I am now a Casio fan!  I've tried the Z60 (please, read my review which is coming shortly), and after doing some research, comparison, and analysis, I've decided to buy myself a Z600 (I will explain in my review all the details).

Otherwise this camera looks to be good.  I just got my V530 and shot a bunch of pictures in different modes and resolutions and the are all acceptible to good quality -- for the price of the camera I am happy with the results.  The menus are a little non-intuitive to navigate but not a big deal once you get the hang of this camera.  Since I intend to travel with this camera and do not want to lug the cradle/docking station I purchased an after market charger from Kodak, the K7500-C BATTERY CHARGER KIT, about $35 plus shipping.  This is a neat unit that accomodates the battery to be charged and plugs in, entire unit, into the wall outlet (very much like you would plug in a shaver for charging).  This charger is also universal voltage that can adapt to many outlet shapes in use worldwide.  You can also adapt the unit to plug into a car outlet for charging on the road, a real neat feature.  Since I am generally paranoid about installing any software other than that which I absolutely need, I did not bother installing any of the Kodak software since I use a stand alone memory card reader that I have attached to my laptop.  So all I need to do is pop the card out of the camera, plug it into my reader to copy the pictures.  Then I place the card back into the camera and do a Format so that I have a \"fresh\" card.  I am using a 512mb card (Kingston, generic SD card) which works great.  Because of the K7500-C and my laptop's built-in SD card reader, I have no use for the cradle/docking station, but hang on to it anyway since that cradle's USB port may be the only route to upgrade the camera's firmware should the need ever arise.  I'll try to post an update to this once I get some more experience with my V530.Update 7/7/2006. Well I am back from my vacation and have some fantastic pictures.  Overall over one week I found this camera to be very easy to use.  I did find it irritating that every time I would switch the camera off and then on, it would revert to the default \"Fully Automatic\" mode.  I have programmed many special settings into the \"Custom\" setting which is the setting I like to use.  Having to manually switch to Custom mode every time I turned on the camera was a bit of a pain.  Many times I simply left the camera in the default \"Fully Automatic\" mode and the pictures were great, especially outdoors in bright sunlight.  Oh yes, another thing ... the stand alone charger I recommended above turned out not all that convenient after all mainly due to its bulk.  I was hoping to not have to lug along the bulky charging cradle but the stand along charger was actually bulkier than the supplied charging cradle!!  The charging cradle contacts look very delicate and I will not be surprised if one day the contacts get bent or otherwise damaged rendering the cradle interface useless.

The controls are well placed so you don't accidentally push buttons while holding the camera. Display is great and I like the metal shell rather than plastic. I have a more expensive digital camera, but found that I don't use it as often because of the size.  This Kodak is perfect to slip into a pocket or purse, however, I'm very disappointed in the quality of the pictures in \"low light\".  I have used other cameras that perform well in the same light conditions without having to use the flash.  During an evening outing at Christmas time, we took pictures with an older Sony Cybershot and got great pictures.  My new V530 wouldn't even produce an image in the same conditions; the only option would be to use the flash and end up with the typical washed out looking pictures that didn't capture the true look of the shot.  The video is fun feature.  I find it interesting that the video will capture better images in low light than the still photos.

It was small, took good pictures and handled well.  As time went on it developed some minor issues.  At times when I would turn it off, the lens would not retract completely. I just brushed it off as being typical electronic malfunction.  This was until it completely stopped working this summer.

I chalked up to be wear and tear and continued to use because the camera work fine otherwise.

You can also choose to have them repair it, but it will cost $35 shipping and handling plus the cost of the repair.)Now about a year after purchase, 4 months after the initial repair, I'm stuck with the same problem.  I've decided to give up on this one and buy a higher quality camera.  I have a lot of friends using Canon Power Shot SD600.

I was told it was because Kodak was going to quit making this model, which is a shame.Pros- It takes great pictures, and it is very compact and stylish (I made a case for mine out of a hard-cased band-aid box because it is that small!); I always get compliments on how great it looks. I hadn't considered a kodak before due to the cheap feeling of the outside, but this one broke the mold with style and image quality. The lcd is big enough and its crystal clear. It also has a neat feature that will brighten or darken the picture without having to go through a bunch of menus. The video feature is handy, although I'm not sure I'm too crazy about the fact that it gives you the stills with it. The dock that comes with it is a great way to display it, but seems to be a double edged sword (I'll come back to this).Cons- the \"OK\" button is definately too small, as i have small hands and still have to use my nail to press it. Occasionaly indoor pictures turn out a little dark, probably because the flash is right where your hand would normally sit. The battery life is nothing to write home about, but its satisfactory. The dock that comes with it looks nice but it really is not practical as far as transfering pictures because you have to have it plugged in to an outlet and into the computer to transfer pictures, but it is bearable. It came with a neck strap vs. a wrist strap, but thats just personal preference. You can't use the favorite feature without using kodak easyshare software, which is really annoying. These are just a couple of small things that are trivial, as only one thing about this camera really makes me upset- the video records in MOV. This means it will only play in apple quicktime and is not compatible with Windows Media Player or Windows Movie Maker unless you use a converter, which is really unneccesary. Kodak should've thought that one through a little more.Overall I would not hesitate in recommending this camera, and would strongly suggest the black if you are considering it.

Okay, I think, fine.  Receive subsequent letter from UC saying upon further inspection, the damage is due to customer misuse and warranty is void and it will be $180 to fix the camera.  I challenge this with UC who says I must call Kodak.  I call Kodak who says that the final decision is made by UC.

Throughout the years, as the digital camera market has evolved, I've tried out several other compact point-and-shoot ones from other reputable brands like Panasonic and Canon. Here is my experience.  The Panasonic (Lumix DMC TZ4K) has many whistles-and-bells features but the picture colors were not bright and cheerful; and the Panasonic was not user-friendly and always a pain to remember how to adjust it. The Canon one (Powershot series) has bright colors and nice face-zoom feature, but the battery life is terrible. So far, the only one that I have felt comfortable to use, and the only one that consistently delivers is this Kodak V530. Of course, it has limited functions of only 5MP and 3X Optical zoom because it was one of the early digital cameras that came out back then. However, the pictures came out from this Kodak camera are always bright, cheerful, and the right tone, and I rarely have to adjust or edit the pictures. I believe the brand name lens Schneider-Kreuznach-Variogon and Kodak Color Science must have contributed to the beautiful pictures.A few days ago, I had my Graduation day, and I brought with me both the Canon and this Kodak cameras.  The Canon supposedly is a more technologically advanced camera, but I brought this Kodak camera as a back-up, just in case. Oh, glad I did! The Canon would not work, asking me to change or recharge the battery, even if its battery was freshly charged. After fumbling a few minutes with the Canon, I tossed it back to my purse, and pulled out this old-time Kodak camera, which I did not charge the night before at all, but it still retained a nice amount of battery power. And most importantly, it worked! I was so tired at the end of the Commencement ceremony; it was a hot and humid day and a rather gloomy afternoon, so I did not expect the pictures would be very nice. To my surprise, the pictures were brightly cheerful, with good colors, good tone, and good focus! I post the pictures on my Facebook, and my friends and family all liked the quality of the pictures!This old Kodak V530 camera still saves my day! I only wish it had more megapixel.

It even has a setting on there for fireworks and moving objects.One of the main issues I had with the camera that I would have change is the size of the viewing screen and what it is made out of. I just would have liked to see the screen a little bit bigger. Some cameras now have the screen covering the entire back of it and I would like to see this screen bigger. Also, whatever the screen is made of attracts fingerprints like crazy. Every time I would try to wipe off the screen, I just smeared the fingerprints instead of really getting rid of them. I would have liked to see the screen more of a shiny substance easier for wiping off or including some kind of cloth that will take off all the smudges.I recently had to buy a new camera because this one just bit the dust after 3 years. Suddenly the camera just stopped working and I was unable to turn it on or off. The shutter wouldn't come out. Or, if it did, I would have to wait until the camera battery died for it to go back in. Also, all of the screws except one that hold the front cover on fell out.Overall, I would recommend this camera as a solid first digital camera to give a young person to capture the last of their teen years.

It will not save a video correctly. It is over simplified and there really isn't much you can do to edit pictures. Sometimes it won't allow you to correct red eye which seems like a basic function.

Amazingly, it shoots 640x480 video at 30 fps, about 30 minutes on a one gigabyte SD card--and it's smaller than a deck of cards.  It takes more than adequate photos, too.The video feature is really useful to me.  In my work, I'm responsible for developing a seven minute video each year, and having the Kodak V530 will enable me to shoot useful footage on the spur of the moment, with pretty good audio to boot.  As another reviewer noted, it's about VHS quality.  It's definitely not as good as a real videocam--its autofocus makes a sound that sometime can be heard, and it has trouble with changes in light--but it is surprisingly good.  For my purposes, the tiny size and ability to shoot useful footage on 5 seconds notice, really spontaneously, is very helpful.Re photo quality, I've found that iPhoto does a great job on quickly improving the exposure.  The flash is a little on the weak side, and I haven't mastered all the different setting options.  Too, the detail isn't all that I might have hoped for.Extra batteries are very cheap on Amazon--got a nonKodak equivalent for about $[...]So why did I give this 5 stars?

I would like to buy another pocket digital camera, but to be honest...ALL 3 TIMES OPTIACAL ZOOM cameras are bad.  I've tried  a sony, a nikon, a canon, a casio, a pentax...none have picture quality.  I am a very picky person when it comes to quality.  Pictures are memories of ones lives...we need better quality photos.  Why can't camera manufactures start working on improving the optical zooms on these pocket cameras?  THIS...THIS IS VERY IMPORTANT.  In case you didn't realize what the difference between and optical and a digital zoom is...is the optical zoom is the closest comparison to a human eye.  Digital is tiny parts that make up a picutre.  Like a pixel.First the optical kicks in and then the digital.  Digital distorts an image that is already been streched by the optical zoom.  You should always look for a high optical camera when buying one.  I have a Nikon Coolpix 8700 that has an 8x optical zoom. My pictures are very good. They sell them up to 12 x optical to retailers.  Of course..you pay big dollars for this..But.  Man.  What wonderful quality.  Of course the CCD adds alot as well.But back to the KODAK V530.  I give it an 8 out of 10.  The macro is good.  Just don't hold it too close to your macro subject.  Hold it steady and use auto flash and your picture should be good.Telephoto is grainy!  I dont like the telephoto on this camera.That is my disapointment.  You need that killer optical zoom for telephoto shots.LETS COMPLAIN TO THE MANUFACUTUERS...MAKE BETTER OPTICAL ZOOM  POCKET CAMERAS....AT LEAST A 6 TIMES.PS...THERE IS NO VIEW FINDER ON THIS KODAK CAMERA.

Some cameras do offer higher resolution, but at a tradeoff of lower frame-rate, which renders it useless.The sound quality of the video recordings is also good. Recording at a 16kHz, it's better than most. Subjectively, both bass and high end came through with impressive clarity for gadget like this. Also, very little camera noise comes through in the audio (only if you zoom or refocus).Finally, the mpeg4 encoding scheme compresses video files to a much smaller size than on most other cameras. At full res with a 1GB memory card, I was able to record more than 25min of video. That's 3 times more than the 8 min capacity offered by most other cameras (also on 1gb card).My only complaint about the video mode is that it seems like it's impossible to completely disable the auto-focus. So when you move to a new subject, you will often hear a loud click in the audio as the camera re-focuses.Bottom line is that I wouldn't use this camera for quality photos.
