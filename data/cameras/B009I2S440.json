{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Amazing camera - stills and video - with great \"extras\"", "Author": "Lauren", "ReviewID": "RGG38AA7RZSVK", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I could not be happier than I was when I received this camera, along with the cool bundle pack. The Canon Powershot SX50 is an amazing piece of equipment.I'm a professional photographer who has been shooting for 35 years. I have worked with great equipment, expensive equipment, and some of the cheapest equipment. My belief is that - the creator and his/her abilities are ultimately more important than the equipment. I say that because the SX50 is not the most expensive camera, but it sure does compete excellently against them.Being primarily a film guy, who was about to transition into the digital world (even if only 50%), I did some extensive research on the products currently available. This one made the most sense. The Canon SX50 offered so many variables which were impossible to ignore. Even if someone is looking for a simple camera, this will do the trick and falls into the right price range. But if you are looking to do more professional shooting, this is still the camera for you. For someone who resisted the concept of digital cameras for so long, I cannot heap enough praise on this one.The three main reasons I chose this camera are: 1) Price, 2) the incredible Wide-Angle Optical Zoom lens, and 3) the great photographic options within the system.The Pros:* Decent weight - not too heavy, but not so light that it will shake in your hands.* The feel - This camera just feels so right in my hand. The grip is created usefully, and the camera is well-balanced.* A fantastic 50x Wide-Angle Optical Zoom.  even further with the digital zoom. Yes, you can take full view close-up photos of the moon right from your yard. I would recommend a tripod for stability though, but I have taken decent photos just by hand. This offers the ability to shoot wide landscapes up distant buildings and people. And seeing how \"point and shoot\" cameras are being allowed more at concerts and events, this one allows the ability to take close photos from all the way up in the balcony. Amazing!* The options - There are many great extra features and options on the system that allow for better photographing without having to know much about Photoshop or outside editing techniques. From offering brilliant vibrance to color photographs, to various tinting options, to various lighting options (daylight, cloudy, Tungsten, etc), as well as various professional setting abilities for setting one's own functions.* Photo quality - The Canon SX50 creates some stunning photographic results - from low light to daylight. Some pictures may take some tweaking, depending on your understanding of photographic techniques and how much individual control the user wants to put in, but primarily offering very easy controls. The results are very nice.* Battery life - I found, for various types of photography that I do, that the battery life was quite adequate - although I would always suggest buying at least one back-up battery if you do a lot of photographing or video shooting.* The video - Amazing! This shoots actual 1080p HD video, in proper format. I have shot events, concerts, landscapes, and some film projects using the Canon SX50, and found it to be excellent. This is not hype. I did not know what to expect, and frankly wasn't expecting too much outside of adequacy. What I did find was exceptional video quality, stability, and representation. I could not be happier, and I do plan to shoot some bigger film projects using the SX50, to prove that in this day and age, one does not need to spend thousands of dollars to create great art (or decent quality at the very least). For budding filmmakers who want a camera as well, I absolutely recommend the Canon SX50* Video effects - There are some cool effects such as miniaturization and slow-motion that are quite effective, but what I really love is that the SX50 shoots 24fps, giving video that \"real film\" appearance as opposed to the cheap \"Cops\" show look. I really cannot stand most digital video, so I am thrilled about this aspect.* Builit-in Flash AND ability to connect a mounted higher-quality flash - I have seen complaints from some users who mistakenly thought that there was no hot-shoe on the SX50. There is. It is located just above and in front of the view-finder. See the manual on proper removal for usage.The Cons:* Not much. I would suggest getting the highest quality memory card you want to afford, to ensure faster photo shooting, and faster downloading onto your computer.The Results:And excellent camera, in an excellent price-range, that provides some very exceptional features for both the amateur and the professional. If you are someone who has already spent thousands on SLR equipment, you would not go wrong buying this as a back-up camera. And for those who are beginners or amateurs, looking for \"something to just take photos with,\" considering camera prices and features, the SX50 will remain with you for a very long time, negating any reason to think about upgrading in the near future. Simple to use, easy to handle, and feature-packed. Buy it!", "Date": "October 10, 2012"}, {"Title": "Amazing Camera!", "Author": "Shannon", "ReviewID": "R3ATD91XSCTJN2", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I purchased this item after my other camera was stolen.  My previous camera was also a Canon Powershot S3IS, which I absolutely loved and was sad to not have anymore.  I researched extensively which camera I wanted to replace it with...although I loved my Canon, I wanted to check out all the options and make sure that I was making the best possible choice.  After going back and forth between several cameras, some which were more pricey, I decided on the Canon since I was familiar with the layout and had such a good experience with my previous camera.  I needed the camera for a trip to Disneyland and it arrived only a few days before so I had no time to really play with it and see how it performed. I was quite frankly worried that it may not perform as well as I hoped...less MP, less features etc.  After 4 days in Disneyland, I was blown away by the amazing capability of this camera!  The picture clarity is unbelievable and the zoom....WOW!  I bought this as a bundle package through Beach Camera and very happy that I did.  Beach Camera customer service was excellent...after contacting them directly they made sure that my camera arrived prior to my trip.  All the accessories included in the package worked great and even loved the camera bag...nothing fancy and just big enough for the camera and a small thing or two, which made it perfect for storing in the backpack when not in use.Pros- Amazing zoom function...in Disneyland or anywhere else, this is an excellent feature.  The optical zoom is amazing and with the stabalizers you can get really great shots at the maximum distance with nominal shakiness or blurr.- Low light conditions - this camera is fantastic in low light conditions, much better than my previous camera, which again I LOVED! There is a setting for nighttime shots which takes stunning nighttime pics...imagine Disneyland at night during the fireworks, castle all lit up.  With my old Canon I was never able to get very good nighttime shots as it always blurred or simply came out too dark.  This camera puts any other camera I have had to shame...seriously!- Multi shot shutter function - this is on both my pro's and cons because it is an awesome feature, but it takes some getting used to.  It is great for getting those action shots and with great quality.- Video function - can't tell you how perfect it is to have a camera and video all in one, especially when travelling.  The video quality on this is amazing, though I have only used it a little up to this point.- Dial - I know for some this may not be a pro, but as someone who owned a Canon prior, this made it a done deal for me.  I already was familiar with it and knew basically where to find everything that I wanted...it made it all that much easier to navigate around.  This was especially important for me as I needed to be able to use it right away on vacation without having to worry about how to actually use it.- Battery Life - I found the battery life to be pretty good overall.  I did purchase an extra battery and at the end of the day it was just about done.  That is considering that we were at Disneyland for about 12-16 hours everyday and it got a LOT of use, so in my opinion pretty darn good!  At the end of the night I popped in the new battery and threw the other in the charger and never had an issue.Cons- Size and weight - not really a big con because I was used to a bigger size camera with my old Canon, but it was a bit bigger so took some getting used to.  That being said, it is still very manageable and easily fits into a backpack for safekeeping when not in use...try that with a gigantic SLR that needs its own suitcase to lug it around.- Mulit shot shutter function - again on both because while it is a great function, it takes some getting used to and in the beginning I found myself with many, many extra shots that I then had to go through later and delete as they were sometimes \"accidental\"All in all, I am completely 100% happy with my purchase.  After I purchased it I agonized over whether I had made the right decision, but I am happy to say that this camera has exceeded and blown away all my expectations.  I have only had it for about 2 months, so there is much more that I still need to learn and I am sure that once I get more familiar with it and the many functions that I will be even happier.  For the novice photographer or professional, this is an excellent buy...you will not be sorry you went with the Canon SX50...excellent camera!", "Date": "January 28, 2013"}, {"Title": "Best camera ever!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!", "Author": "Lanie Kate", "ReviewID": "R221M0BY6PWBNS", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "For someone who is not an expert and needs automatic but some extra choices - this is super!!

They compare favorably with photos taken with my other smaller Canon Powershot cameras,  I am especially pleased with the powerful zoom.I plan to take advantage of the features on the SX50 to photograph babies and children.The camera is no problem to carry with the neck strap, including exploring at Mesa Verde and hiking.

It is worth at least 4.5 stars. Here are a couple of things I'd like to add.It is tricky at first. I find setting up the two custom buttons just for how I like to normally use the camera really helps on the fly.I do have a complaint. The dial and buttons on the back react to the palm of my hand as I am simply holding the camera. This needs fixing for the next version.Finally, no one else mentioned birding with this camera. I have literally imaged birds with this camera that, because of the long lens, I was able to identify after downloading, but they were too far away to really see in the field.
