When asked, Celestron finally responded after two days that I need to put the camera onto the star diagonal in order to focus it instead of directly into the visual back, which is completely wrong!  Then they proceeded to tell me that a product that is supposed to be supported by Windows 8 (both 32 and 64 bit) must have installed the wrong drivers and gave me a link to drivers for the wrong camera!  To make it worse they even suggested that my USB port is not supplying the camera with enough power and to try all of the ports.  A 5V port that can power an external hard drive is more than enough to power this small CCD chip, it is basic Electrical Engineering.  So I have had enough of this nonsense and am returning this for a cheaper and much better Canon DSLR and T-mount as I should have gotten in the first place.", "Date": "September 7, 2013"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": null, "Features": null, "Name": null, "ImgURL": null, "ProductID": "B00DQSBAA2"}}
