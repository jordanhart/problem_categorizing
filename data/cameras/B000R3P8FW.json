{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Mighty mini", "Author": "music fan, amman, jordan", "ReviewID": "R2D3HAMJF628V0", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Fantastic take everywhere camera. Standout features are (i) excellent image detail (ii) tremendous auto white balance, best appreciated on a calibrated monitor (iii) very easy to use (iv) highly portable and unobtrusive. If the camera is held super steady, the pictures can be sharp too. At the highest quality settings, the files allow for significant crops and enlargements.The lens is competent enough and does the job. The let down is that it's not wide enough at the wide end and is pointlessly long at the long end. In 35mm terms, it is a 37-111 zoom; a 24-70mm would have been more useful for day to day and travel snaps. The longer focal lengths are unusable handheld because they greatly magnify vibration and the really unimpressive anti-shake system is of little help there. A shorter, wider, optically superior lens would have given the camera more bite. To be fair, though, most comparable compacts have the same lens coverage; even the Canon G9 does not go much wider, but Casio could have been more innovative and daring.The packaged software transfers images to a computer but does nothing beyond that. For non-destructive jpeg editing, Picasa is necessary and is brilliant.My unit persistently overexposes so I routinely reset exposure to EV -0.7 or more before each shot. The -0.7 setting is lost at power-off and has to be reset at each power-on which is very frustrating. If there's a way to store this setting, I still haven't found it.The z1200 gets 5 stars because if I were buying again today, this is the one I'd get. Used with discipline and imagination, the results are frequently breathtaking.", "Date": "November 6, 2007"}, {"Title": "Awesome Camera", "Author": "Nhan Nguyen", "ReviewID": "R3LS78SLA1TW1O", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I bought this camera a week before my trip and I really like it.

Movie mode is practically HD quality albeit at 24fps.  I like the adjustable flash intensity, which is good for macro mode.  The face recognition mode sounds pretty impressive technically, but I doubt if I will ever use that, and it wasnt a consideration for me.Cons: for me, the Quicktim MOV movie format is a step backwards, compared to the AVI format of the Z850, as my video editor will not take it directly and I have to do a conversion step. Also, the frame rate of 24fps is slower than the 30fps of the Z850 and the motion in movies does appear noticeably jerkier than in the Z850.  Also the shot-shot delay time seems longer in the Z1200 than the Z850, it seems to take about 2 seconds in the Z1200, and about 1 second in the Z850 (both at max res superfine quality). The absence of the mode select wheel is a minor annoyance, I find it hard to get used to the new scheme of selecting shooting mode, which takes more time to select an option. After a month of using it, I still find myself preferring the Z850 because of the mode select wheel, and the AVI movie format.Overall, a very attractive, easy to use, and powerful camera with excellent picture quality!", "Date": "December 10, 2008"}, {"Title": "I GOT BURNED.
