Also its really cool that it shoots video at 720p, the quality of the video is not out of this world tho, the video image looks kind of dull ... its not amazing, but it works.

It is available in red, indigo, black and silver. I just got it so i haven't done much on it but i have taken a few test shot and they came out crystal clear. It is user friendly and perfect for me.

The few photos I have taken were crystal clear and downloaded quickly and easily to my PC. I know it can take hi def recording but I need a larger memory card, they always give you just a few megabytes. Overall I am very pleased with the camera especially for the price.

Finn", "ReviewID": "R2JNM72CU9D1PS", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "Bought this for Christmas 2013. At first loved the price and quality seemed ok. However after repeated indoor use I found photos taken without the flash came out blurred half the time, and when using the flash it took about 20 seconds(which seems like a life time when trying to take a picture) for the camera to refocus for the next shot. Outside without the flash it works fine for a $50 camera...not a $90 one. There are better deals out there.", "Date": "September 26, 2013"}, {"Title": "Nice Little Camera", "Author": "Busy Mom", "ReviewID": "R3KZR0ZWIH2VJJ", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "We got three different brands of camerasfor our kids at Xmas.
