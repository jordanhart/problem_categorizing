I have a six year old Olympus C-2100 ultra zoom 2.1 MP camera, and the reason I have never upgraded is because the image quality is simply sensational on that camera. So I bought another Olympus thinking that the state of the art would have improved even more. However, my six year old camera simply blows away this one when it comes to image quality. Yes, it's big and clunky compared to this one, and this camera is easier to use, but at the end of the day what difference does that make if the pictures aren't as good?Specifically, the edges are too \"soft\", particularly indoors with the relatively weak flash. Also very grainy in low-light situations.I was simply astounded when I compared the 400KB jpeg files from my old camera to the 2.5MB pictures from this one. There is really no comparison. Everything from color correction, color fidelity, sharpness, graininess: simply EVERYTHING is better on the old images.So next time I'm looking for a compact camera, I'll do more homework first.

I had a chance to use it and I give it a big thumbs up.  Now, keep in mind this is a point and shoot style camera and if you're looking for 'pro' features and quality, go look at a Canon or Nikon SLR.  I do reccomend this for a first time buyer on a budget and wants easy straight forward controls.  It has high resolution for the price range, enough optical zoom to work with and a unique help screen that gives you tips and hints on how to take better photos in different situations.This little camera is tough to beat since not many other manufacturers offer simlar features in this price range.  The next closest one I would consider would be the Nikon L15 simply for it's size.  I own Canon cameras myself but they don't offer one quite this small unless you spend $250 or more.It does offer many automatic settings which will adjust settings to most typical shooting situations.  I did notice that the flash can either overpower and washout photos if you're too close or be underpowered if you try to zoom on a subject in low light settings.  There isn't much you can do but I suggest that you try to use the flast on subjects atleast 5-6 feet from the camera and no more than 8-10 feet.  There's not much you can do to compensate for the lighting other than to have actual light on your subject.

I had a $400 Nikon camera which decided to break on me 1 month after the 1 yr warranty. I had a Sony Cybershot (forgot which one) which lasted at least 2 yrs. But the new ones are not even close to the quality of the old ones. A Canon Powershot A530 - which got great reviews... but has a CONSTANT battery low blinking.. That only lasted 5 months.  Lastly, a DXG (Kyocera) CHEAP CHEAP CHEAP $50 dig camera. Waste of money, stay away from it!! That thing is a joke!  Anyhow, none of them lasted long for what I paid. I bought the Olympus this time, because regardless of the quality of the pictures, I wanted something that will LAST longer than 1 or 2 yrs this time. So far, so good. It's been 6-8 mos since I purchased it.The quality of the pictures are not exceptional. But they take good enough pictures. I used to have to have a great camera for when I sold on ebay, but these are just general pictures I take now. Thank God for Jasc Paint Shop Pro.. at least with that, I can fix a lot of them. I will say though, it is a better quality camera for motion pictures. Most others I had before I would have to take numerous pictures if I didn't have a steady hand or whatever. (Edited: NOTE!!  This camera is TERRIBLE for taking evening pictures. No matter WHAT way you take them!!!!!)One thing I especially don't like about this camera. I've had a bunch of cheap AA batteries laying around that I wanted to use up. They don't even work. If you want this camera to last longer than one use, I highly suggest getting the Engergizer Lithium batteries. I miss the fact with my old cameras, you could just pop out the big battery and put it in the charger. They always had a much stronger charge time.Overall, this camera is easy to use. Point and shoot, you can get done easily without any knowledge. Even if you want to use the other options, it's set up very easy to change the way it takes pictures. Overall, it's about a 3 out of 5 due for the fact it has only so-so quality pictures. Btw people.. those you not knowledgeable about megapixels.. You really don't even need a 7mp camera! You really only need a 3 or 4 sized one. 7mp will allow you to print a poster. and I'm sure most of you won't be doing that.Bottom line. Do a lot of research prior to spending your money on a digital camera! As you can see, I have gone thru A LOT of them, and spent A LOT of money. And I'm getting no where fast. My most reliable camera for the past 5 yrs is a regular film camera I bought USED on ebay for $100 - Minolta QTsi.

When I read the reviews, I got nervous. So I popped it out and took it around with me a couple days, including an evening at a Sonics game that the hubby won tix for.I didn't run out of battery power, so I am thinking consumption is on the high average of most digital equipment. The lag time is what it is for most dig cameras, you can't spend a hundred bucks and think you will get something that speedy. It was as slow as my 3 year old 5mp that I love, and yep I have to anticipate the shot for it.Really the critical thing is the prints, and yes they are soft. That is because a 1gb card can hold 500 somthing on \"normal\" on a 7mp camera!!! The compression rate is extreme!!! I set it to fine, and when looking at the photos, print size is about 8x10, give or take, but looking at pixel size it is incredibly artifacted.So if you want something that gives you phenomenal enlargements, well nope, but even tho my daughter shows signs of wanting to follow in my photographic footsteps, this is the camera she can take all around with her,  goof around with her friends, and come to me if she wants something more artistic.People who are severely disappointed with it, well the best quality and features cost more than a hundred bucks.", "Date": "April 7, 2008"}, {"Title": "Manufacturer needs better disclosure!", "Author": "styledaraweb", "ReviewID": "R6XU1CA8I6UXO", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "This camera was brought to replace a Sony 3.1 mega-pixel.

Mostly, I take pictures of my family, pets, vacations, and some random nature shots. I previously had Fuji cameras and were very happy with them. When it was time to move from my 4 megapixels Fuji to something with more mega pixels, I decided to go with this camera for the price and because it could use the same memory cards as the Fuji.Without a doubt, the regular pictures that I took with this Olympus were wonderful. They were crisp and clear, even after cropping. The only thing is that some times the pictures were a little dull but I would simply darken the contrast with the software and the colors would turn truer and more vivid. I loved the clean, larger, close up videos as well (although I wished it had sound).However, I still used my Fuji for closeups. The super macro mode on this camera gave me blurry pictures, the regular macro was too grainy. I was absolutely frustrated with the camera up to this point.What I found out though is that if you play around with the camera long enough, you will get what you want. I finally realized with super macro mode, you had to focus first and indoors, you needed extra light. Also, use the image stabilization when using super macro. The pictures were amazing! Once I figured the camera out, I went crazy taking pictures every where I went and having so much fun with it.Many people after seeing my pictures have asked what type of camera I used and are shocked when I tell them, they were expecting something more expensive. Obviously, if I had a couple hundred dollars to spend on a better camera, I would.

It does have a built in stabilizer but even then, the reaction time is slow.  The Olympus FE-210 takes 2 AA batteries which is a nice feature as compared to a custom battery but the camera sucks too much power so you'll need to buy quite a few if you're going to take a lot of pics for the day.  The biggest gripe, no sound when recording a movie.  A 7.1 mega pixel camera that doesn't record sound?  Quote taken directly from their \"Advanced manual\": Recording movies Recording moving images. Sound is not recorded (end quote).  And that does not mean that if you record non-moving images it will.

I've had it out for long periods in temps down to 40 degrees with no problem and have used it outdoors well below freezing, but I carried it from inside and didn't let it cool down much before I was back inside.Shutter is slow (note price of camera!) but long range action shots work pretty well. If you have to have speed, buy up. I bought this primarily to have a camera that would fit in my pocket and take decent pictures.If you want a decent little camera for not much money, you simply can't beat this for bang for the buck.

In the past year I've used it mabey 5 times. In this year the lens managed to get scratched I paid $80 to fix it plus I bought a case for it. Nevermind the 10 batteries it has already gone through.This camera is so SLOW! Kids don't hold still. the flash goes off 10 seconds after you push the button. When it does go off, everything is blurry. I'm amazed at how many crappy pictures I can take.So now, on my fifth and final time using this camera, I was going through and deleting some of my fuzzy pictures, when the entire screen goes white. I can't view anything, take pictures, or put them on my computer. Nothing.

It is! But what they had in common was no audio with the video! The memory card would get errors and freeze on me. I charged a new set of batteries and put it into the cam just to hear it beep and say that it's low and would turn off. Then after repeatedly turning it back on, it'll show that the battery is fully charged. It does that often. It's ridiculous, frustrating and the purchase isn't worth it. The lag on this camera is appalling. It'll take minutes to process a picture and by that time you're ready to scream like a madman in public.If you're reading this, hit your back browser to another item.", "Date": "November 25, 2007"}, {"Title": "Buggy and Awkward in Use", "Author": "Eric W.
