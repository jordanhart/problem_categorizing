It really helps me when I need to inspect a nest in a cavity of a tree or in a cave in the ground I can see what species are using the cavity, how many individuals there are and if it has eggs or young. The only mishap was when I put the sensor in a cavity in the ground where lived a skunk... Plop! -  I had to run and return at night to get my equipment. It is excellent and I recommend for this and other uses.", "Date": "November 9, 2011"}, {"Title": "Amazing", "Author": "rsalamun6147 \"rsalamun6147\"", "ReviewID": "R9E7J773DS92I", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "works flawlessly. would recomended to anyone that needs an inspection scope for automotive work and exploration. great visability on screen.", "Date": "December 23, 2012"}, {"Title": "Great product!", "Author": "Amazon Customer \"RunningGal\"", "ReviewID": "R1TTWQASVS84YD", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I bought this for my husband, & although he has not used it a lot yet, he absolutely loves all the features.

The model number ordered was identified as \"8802AL\" in the operator's manual. The accessories for this model include a 90 degree viewing mirror, a magnet tip for retrieving magnetic objects, and a hook to retrieve small objects. The problem I had with the order, and the reason I could not rate the product at 5 stars, is the accessories shipped were meant to be mounted on borescope/camera model \"8803AL\" and the supplier was not very accommodating.I contacted this supplier, BrainyDeal, several times about the discrepancy, citing the operator's manual and providing photographs of the accessory configuration supplied with the order. Despite the photographic evidence, Brainydeal insisted the parts shipped were correct. The borescope was needed for an on-going aircraft wing and fuselage under-floor inspection so returning the tool was not an option. Unfortunately for me, I was unable to use the 90 degree mirror since its mounting was not compatible with the product provided and there was a real risk the mirror and other accessories would get dislodge in an inaccessible area. If I were somewhat sleazy, I could have used the borescope/camera for the job and returned it afterwards for a refund. Then I might not have written this product review.The borescope/camera is useful and worth the money, but think about supplier performance before you purchase from BrainyDeal.", "Date": "June 23, 2013"}, {"Title": "Excellent!", "Author": "Louis Martinez", "ReviewID": "R2LFV5637KT6ZV", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Before I purchased this inspection camera I bought the 'Mini 7mm USB Flexible Inspection Camera Microscope Borescope Endoscope' at $38.
