This camera is an upgrade of the SX100 and feels much more sleeker than the previous model.Here is my take on the camera:Strengths:- 9MP CCD sensor with DigicIII processor, the CCD sensor is 1/2.3 inch which is bigger than the most SD series cameras resulting in better pictures- Controls are intuitive and a separate replay start button on the back gives you the flexibility to switch on the camera for playback without extending the lens- Feels good in the hands, battery compartment gives the camera a better grip, DSLR like black color- Huge 3\" LCD scratch resistant screen makes composing shots easy- Great 10X optical zoom and 40X digital zoom- Flash can be flipped up or down as needed, this camera also offers 3 manual flash settings which really helps with portraits- Sharp pictures - Daylight pictures are excellent and zoom is great for capturing landscapes- Many modes to shoot - night mode, portrait, landscape, kids and pets, indoors, special scene modes (fireworks, aquarium, foliage, snow, beach etc.) and custom colors too- 2 extra buttons at the back for changing exposure in 1/3 stops and also adjust for face detection- Macro mode results in stunning close-ups with outstanding level of detail- Uses 2 AA batteries, can take 300-400 pics with one set of rechargeable NiMHs and if you run out of battery they are universally availableLimitations:- Size and bulk makes it inconvenient to carry at all times, this will probably become your vacation/ special occasion camera.- No optical viewfinder, has not bothered me but can become an issue for some especially in bright sunlight or if you want to conserve battery- Noise is noticeable beginning at ISO 400, ISO 1600 mostly unuseable- Cannot adjust focus or optical zoom while shooting in movie mode, you can only zoom in digitally which reduces movie picture quality- Typical Canon chromatic aberration (common problem with P&S; cameras)- No RAW shooting modeOverall, this is a great camera for the price if you want a camera with high zoom, especially for shooting outdoors in good light. It also offers some manual functions as well as flash reduction which helps you take the best picture.", "Date": "October 18, 2008"}, {"Title": "Great zoom, Image Stabil., a little slow", "Author": "Mr. T", "ReviewID": "R3N4O3XX4KTIAT", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "I searched for along time for this kind of camera. (in the $200 range) I was drawn by the 10x zoom and Optical Image Stabilization(IS). (both work great and are very nice to have!) After using it for a few weeks, I have had mixed results. Before you read on, understand that I also shoot with a canon xti, often with a $300 50mm lens on it, so I think my standards might be a little higher than the average user. With that said, here is what I think:When you shoot in auto mode, the ISO it chooses (ISO 200) will not be as clear as the camera is capable of. Thus I find you have to use a Program (P) mode and set it to ISO 80 to get better reduced-noise pictures. Otherwise pictures can be grainy. The pictures are poor at ISO higher than 200.Focusing is a bit slow in low light, and unless you can balance the camera on something steady, and your subject is not moving, you will need to use the flash. As I have read it on reviews on its predecessor Canon sx100, the recycle time on the flash is somewhat annoying. You will have to wait a good 5-6 seconds before you can ready up for another shot. This is a drag when you have people who are posing, or for a subject that is passing you by, like at an evening parade. The flash is set \"on\" or \"off\" by manually raising the flash with your finger. No automatic pop-up. Not a problem for me as I don't like using flashes anyways, especially on this camera!!!I think the video quality out of this camera is great, far better than what I got out of older Sony Cybershot models DSCW-50 and the DSCW-55. Note that you cannot optically zoom while shooting video; it will let you zoom digitally.The upsides for this camera are many. The 3-inch screen is amazing. It does stick out from the back of the camera, rather than being inset, so it may be prone to scratching. The programmable features are excellent. You can adjust the exposure time to 15 seconds. Playback/review is easy and fast, due to a wheel that lets you scroll through pictures quickly. Viewing it on the big screen with auto-rotation (landscape-portrait) makes it easy to check for focusing and such. Macro shooting is amazing. You can practically touch the subject with the lens and get a clear, very detailed shot!If you want a quick convenient camera for casual shooting, don't really care about too much zoom, don't get this camera. Get something smaller and faster, and something that comes with a rechargeable lithium battery. I would stick to Nikons, Sonys and Canons. This one takes two AA's, and dealing with those has its pros and cons. I bought this camera for the big 10x zoom for the relatively small size, and the programmable options. I studied studio tests from dpreview.com (great site!) and found this was the best for my needs. The Lumix TZ5 pics looked fuzzy and the design of the Sony H3 is ugly. For other models and side-by-side comparisons, check that site out.

Caught hold of Canon SX 100 IS, but it vanished from the market before I could purchase it. Wanted a medium size camera so could not settle for Nikon P80/Canon S5 IS, because of its large size. Ordered Canon SX110 on the launch date itself with apprehensions about its features..but believe me, I am not dissapointed AT ALL.Great manual controls for Aperture and Shutter speed make it a camera for Pros, while the Auto mode is wonderful for learning photographers. The zoom is great and the image stabilisation that the camera offers at the maximum zoom level (Even at 10x optical and 4x digital i.e 40x combined zoom) is awesome. The photos in low light during my recent trip to a hill station were good in the Night mode with lots of saturation of natural colours.Face detection is also a good feature with the camera able to detect faces very very easily (I don't know how does it work, but it really works :-))The Digital Zoom, unlike others cameras I have used, does not distort the image to a very large extent, thanks to the high resolution and the safety zoom features. I can upload photos to depict this.(I don't know how to do this in Amazon :-))The battery life seemed ok only , as I was able to shoot around 200 shots with my Sony NiMH(2500mAH) bateries with flash. But the batteries are brand new and should gain more strength with a couple of charge-discharge cycles. But a spare set of batteries is always helpful.I had a Nikon 5600 prior to this so wanted a middle size camera with extended zoom and manual controls, and glad to find SX 110 fit all my needs.A thing that is missing is a Sports mode, which is a feature to shoot fast moving objects. I had this in my Nikon 5600, but could not yet find it on my SX110. Possibly the Manual controls for Aperture and Shutters could make this up for me. Still in the learning phase :-)", "Date": "September 22, 2008"}, {"Title": "Better than I expected", "Author": "D. Golden", "ReviewID": "R2HAGNRUS006N6", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "The feature that made me buy this camera was its image stabilization system. Friends who use digital cameras professionally all told me that Canons optical image stabilized zoom system was the best in its price range. Due to a slowly worsening tremor, this has evolved into an important issue.The digital zoom is amazingly effective. Recently, I caught a game at Fenway Park. My seat was adjacent to the infamous \"Green Monster\". From that distance, I was able to take photos of players at bat, that captured detailed facial features. I was even able to get some very respectable images of players in action.The camera settings are easy to use, and equally easy to access. The Auto setting is fairly idiot proof and does a good job under a wide variety of conditions. I found the SX110 to be solid, well built yet still small enough to fit into a laptop carrying bag.I never imagined that I would buy anything other than a Nikon, but now I  think this was one of the best purchases that I have made in a long time. It delivers on its promises, producing pictures whose quality rivals those of much more expensive digital cameras.", "Date": "October 4, 2008"}, {"Title": "The most camera you can get for this price.", "Author": "RLSd", "ReviewID": "R3BXJX6AIU2Z7G", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I'm a fairly serious hobby photographer and have used the previous model Canon SX100 in addition to the latest SX110. Everything about it is slightly better than the older model, so all the past reviews on the SX100 and praises still apply. The SX110 is like the cheaper version of the Canon G10 (minus RAW, wide angle, flash hotshoe, and build quality), but the CHDK mod could close the gap even more with advanced features. Here's my summary of likes and dislikes:Likes:- Superb image quality for a compact camera, lens corner to corner sharpness, minimum color fringing, and detail vs noise tradeoff are all better than other cameras in its class.- Manual controls (PASM), exposure compensation, contrast/saturation/sharpness adjustments, custom white balance, flash intensity are all adjustable.- 3\" LCD screen with 230k resolution, average specs for new generation cameras today. Viewable from a wide angle, and visible in bright sunny conditions.- 9 Megapixels is good for most large prints, more megapixels would've meant more noise without much improved detail due to physical light diffraction limits.- Good 10x zoom all the way to 360mm equiv.- Macro mode focuses all the way close to 1cm (less than half an inch).- Fast lens, meaning the aperture doesn't get too small as you zoom in so a fast shutter speed can still be used to freeze action far away or in dim conditions.- Optical image stabilization works well giving about 2 stops advantage.- AA batteries are great, get the pre-charged (aka hybrid) NiMH and you can get consistently 400-500 shots per recharge. Also don't have to worry about lost charger on a trip. Better for the environment long-term than proprietary batteries that only fit one camera.Dislikes:- Wide angle not wide enough (28mm would've been better than 36mm)- Minor barrel distortion at the wide angle, only noticeable when there are straight edges in the frame, they look curved.- The zoom setting is not displayed, it only pops up briefly when you change the zoom, and it's not exact. A better solution would've been to always display the 35mm equiv value. Also a zoom resume or preset would be nice, so when camera is powered off and on, it resumes the zoom it was in before. This does happen when the camera powers off to save battery, but not all settings are restored in that situation, such as the drive mode or macro focus settings.- No optical zoom during video recording and HD video, only 640x480 30 fps highest quality.- The software interface is outdated and unintuitive sometimes. Turning auto ISO shift on should AUTOMATICALLY shift the ISO (like older SX100), not requiring the press of the \"print\" button after half pressing the shutter. Some of the features require a lot of button presses. Also auto-power off mode only has option of off or 3 mins, and lens retract in playback is either immediate or 1 min, there should be values in between.- Image noise is noticeable at ISO 800 & higher, not unexpected for a small sensor camera. Maybe if Canon used a slightly bigger sensor like 1/1.6\" instead of 1/2.3\"...- No live histogram. For a serious camera with manual controls, live histogram should be an option instead of only available after the image is taken.- The command wheel is only good for scrolling through a long list, but I would've preferred a less finicky button interface. Sometimes it's easy to accidentally scroll a value when you meant to press the button or vice versa.- Flash recycle can take 7-10 seconds after a full power discharge, but not a big deal since I don't use the on-camera flash much (I use natural lighting with higher ISO sensitivities, or an external slave flash triggered by the camera's flash). It's one of the tradeoffs of using AA batteries.I admit the dislikes are very nit-picky, overall this is a great camera, but I'm writing them here so that either Canon or one if its competitors can pick up on these issues and improve on them in future models.", "Date": "November 11, 2008"}, {"Title": "Really fine camera for the price (4.5 stars)", "Author": "R. Kyle", "ReviewID": "R3F3JVZ8S9T55Y", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "What I love about this camera is it's just plain easy to pick up and use, but it's got a load of advanced features that you can learn as you go.Pick up the SX110 and you can feel how solid and stable it is in your hands.  Okay, it's not the new thinner camera, but it still fits nicely into a shirt pocket.Right off the bat, all the controls are up top and pretty clearly marked and understandable.  Good for Canon.  I looked at another brand and someone had to clue me in on what \"BS\" meant in terms of photography.  It means Best Shot, by the way, but should I have to read the manual to find that out?  The 'easy' settings should be intuitive and they are on the Canon.The zoom is 10X optical, which means you're going to get clearer zooms than you would with a digitally produced effect.  That ends the jagged edges.The 3\" LCD is clear as a bell.  Colors are sharp and they stay that way in the pictures.  In order to defeat the automatic white balance correction, you have scene selectors for sunset, snow scene, and night scene among others.Anti-shake means the camera will correct for tremors in your hands.  This is great if you're like me and take a lot of scenes from a passenger side window.A huge plus is the camera operates on two AA size batteries.  Trust me, this is a very good feature.  We once got ready to go on a whale watching cruise only to discover our fancy camera's proprietary batteries were DOA.  What to do?  No camera store in the vicinity.  We were lucky to find a disposable film camera to take semi-decent shots, but if our camera took AA's we could have bought replacement batteries right off the wharf.The only drawback in this camera is the proximity of the flash to the lens.  Even with red eye on, photos of my Siamese cat looked wrong.  We finally took pictures in room light with 1/10th of a second exposure counting on the anti-shake and got EXCELLENT shots of the cats.If you're looking for a portable camera that's easy to use and supply, this little Canon is a great camera to look at.  For the money, the features and quality of pictures are excellent!Rebecca Kyle, October 2008", "Date": "October 26, 2008"}, {"Title": "First Impressions", "Author": "One persons view \"Dave\"", "ReviewID": "R1GFF1SH1F5SRU", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Out of the box impressions are excellent.

At full optical zoom and 4x digital images are still sharp when using the \"super fine\" and 9MP settings.  Gonna read the book and start playing with all the features.

I dropped it a lot, and after 2 years of prodigious beatings it finally gave out on me.  It was nice while it lasted, but one thing is for sure, I hated the fact that I could not zoom while recording in movie mode.I received that Cyber-Shot 2 years ago, and when I recently researched Sony Cameras, I found out that they still did not offer zoom in movie mode, even in their top of the line equipment.So my first priority when researching a new camera was to make sure Optical or Digital zoom was available while recording video.  I researched every camera on the market, and after such extensive research, Canon was at the top of my list, followed by Nikon and Panasonic.It took me about a week to finally reach my decision, and I am very satisfied with my purchase.  Canon Digital cameras are top of the line, and most of them offer digital zoom in movie mode, and the Canon SX10 even offers 20x Optical zoom in movie mode, but it was too rich for my blood.At the end of the day, the Canon SX110IS had everything I wanted and more.  The things I was looking for were:1.  Zoom enabled in movie mode.2.  3 inch LCD at 230,000 megapixels.3.  Manual mode.  (So I could prepare for Professional SLR cams)4.  Long range zoom in still mode, between 5x-20x.5.  AA cell operated.6.  8-15 Megapixels.7.  28mm Wide Angle Zoom LensThe Canon delivers 6 of the options I wanted and the Panasonic Lumix DMC-TZ5 delivers 5 of the options I wanted.  The DMC-TZ5 is equipped with options 1,2,4,6, and 7, while the Canon is equipped with all of those options, except 7.We might also note that the Panasonic Lumix DMC-TZ5 records movies in HD, and has \"Optical\" zoom enabled in movie mode, while the Canon SX110IS does not offer HD quality movies, and only has the \"Digital\" zoom in movie mode.If you do not know the difference;  For an easy summary, \"Digital\" zoom magnifies the target but distorts the picture as you zoom closer, while \"Optical\" zoom magnifies the target, and as you zoom closer it keeps the image as sharp and clear as possible.  The Canon can only shoot \"still shots\" using the 10x \"Optical\" zoom.In movie mode, it only offers the 4x \"Digital\" zoom, which is not that bad, considering I had no zoom at all in my Sony Cyber-shot.  I have no quibble with the \"Digital\" zoom; I use it, and the picture quality looks fine to me.I went with the Canon because even though I wanted the 28mm wide angle zoom (and the HD video quality, along with \"Optical\" zoom was tempting), I was willing to sacrifice those options for the full manual controls and AA cell operation (and this might only be a rumor, but I heard the Panasonic's picture quality didn't come close to the Canon).  The Panasonic does not offer any manual mode/controls, which would've been an impediment to my learning in order to advance to professional SLR's.I especially like having a camera that is powered by AA batteries.  I recently went to an auto show here in Los Angeles, and I took around 300 pictures (with flash), and when my batteries ran out, I had 2 more AA's to back me up (Sanyo Eneloop, rechargeable (highly recommended)).But even if I didn't have any of my rechargeables on me, I could have went to any concession stand and purchased a pair.  But with a propriety (custom battery), I would've been out of luck.The cons of this camera are as follows:1.  The flash can take forever to recharge sometimes.  At the auto show, the cars spin around on a platform, and when you snap one shot with the flash, you could be looking at 10.3 seconds before your next shot (if the camera had to use the full power of the flash), but then you'll have to wait for the car to spin back around to the position that you wanted.I watched as my neighbors with their thousand dollar cameras, snapped shot after shot, every half second with full power flashes, and never had to stop and wait.  Of course, cheaper cameras offer those functions, but not every other feature I was looking for to go along with it.2.  There is no in camera picture edit, but that's ok, because Canon provides 3 software programs you can use to edit your photos which work perfectly for trimming, cropping, and sharpening, etc.  You can turn on Red Eye Correction in the camera, though.3.  No optical viewfinder, which can really come in handy when you want to conserve power.  But at the same time, I didn't want an optical viewfinder; I wanted a 3-inch LCD.  Most optical viewfinders on cameras within this price range are going to be WAY off targeting (about %80 accurate), but will come in handy when you don't have a place to purchase batteries.4.  If Canon would've went with 28mm wide angle zoom with this camera, I'd be in heaven.Those are the only things I didn't like.  But trust me, the picture quality is so superb, that even when the camera recommends you use the flash, you don't have to, and your pictures will still come out excellent (as long as you had the right settings); so also the functionality, wide range of options, and the manual mode also make your experience highly enjoyable.I also recommend that you buy at least an 8gb memory card.  I purchased the SanDisk, Ultra 2, which is class 4 in speed.  I uploaded around 300, superfine (highest quality), pictures to my computer within 3-4 minutes.For only $200 bucks, the Canon SX110IS is easily worth the buy.  Check out the images I upload from the car show.I check my comments often, so ask any questions if you're still unsure on which camera to go with.And lastly, I don't know why people are rating this camera at 2 and 3 stars, but most of the reviewers sounded like they didn't know what they were doing.

I'm mainly leaving this review for people with kids who are wondering if this camera can keep up with taking quick fast shots, without missing out on precious moments.Fast Camera!!!This camera has NEVER missed a shot and she's a very quick and fast little two year old. I've captured every single quick smile, precious pose, and all of her active moments. I do this using the sports mode. In this mode, the camera actually takes the picture the very same instant you press down on the button (no delay whatsoever). In this mode, when she's running, there is no blurryness.Great Indoor Camera!!!This camera also takes GREAT indoor pics as well. It is a bit heavier than the little camera's out there....but if you want to sacrifice qaulity and performance...go for a little one.Outstanding Detail and Zoom qaulityI wanted something that was powerful, and something that my husband can take to football games, basketball and other sporting events. That's actually how I sold him on the idea of purchasing this camera. The zoom capability is out of this world. For example, we went to the park the other day and I was able to get pictures of the ducks from the OTHER SIDE OF THE LAKE....and in very clear detail. Now that's powerful.Easy to use!!!The minute this camera arrived, I took it out of the box and started using it. I didn't even read the instructions...that's how easy it is to use. I'm more of a beginner type when it comes to camera's. I popped the batteries in, and went crazy taking pics. The video mode has a dedicated button so you can video events very quickly without fussing with dials.No Regrets!!!I hope I've helped someone out on making their purchase decision.

I  purchased an Olympus camera, which despite its high price, I found in my opinion terrible in comparison to my old Canon.As the camera was for our honeymoon, I decided to buy another camera. Unfortunately I purchased the Olympus online at a store that does not offer refunds or exchange on poor choice. Expensive lesson learned there.I purchased the Canon SX110IS from a bricks and mortar store with refund/exchange policy, for peace of mind. Just days before I had recommended friends buy a Canon, and they bought this camera, and when I saw their shots, I knew this was the camera for me.Straight away I felt so relieved and happy that I had purchased another Canon. Beautiful shots even on Auto and Easy modes, with lots of other modes and settings to play around with if you wish.The most important thing about a camera to me is that it takes great pictures on Auto - as I dont like to spend much time playing around, I just like to have fun snapping.The canon has the same size LCD as the Olympus, but the quality of the pixels is MUCH better, and clearer.Image Stabiliser is excellent, (it stabilises the LENS, not the camera body like other cameras),sometimes my hands get shaky with some pictures, but they still come out absolutely beautifully.The colour is amazing, pictures are crisp and sharp, even in low light. I took pictures in a completely dark room and they came out great. I don't mind waiting for the flash to recharge,it does not let you take pictures till it is recharged. In the Olympus I erroneously bought, you had no idea whether the flash was charged or still charging, so you could make the mistake of taking shots too quickly in low light.The camera body feels very sturdy in your hands and you can easily grip it, your hand can wrap around where you see the silver bit, near the words PowerShot SX110. This is in contrast to slimline cameras that probably look prettier this camera. I'd rather have sturdy, especially with such a big lens and zoom. I was, however, surprised when I saw the camera \"in the flesh\" it is a lot smaller than I imagined.Don't worry about lifting the flash (Where canon is written), it's not a bother at all, and the camera (at least in Auto and Easy mode) suggests you lift the flash when it deems it appropriate. If you lift it and have the flash on auto, it wont fire unless required. I just lift the flash whenever I take pictures, but it will only fire when needed.Canon have improved their picture program for the computer too, but some people may not think the program gives you enough to play around with and may seek other programs.One thing that i think would be neat would be the ability to change pictures to black and white or sepia on the camera. That is about the only thing that Olympus did that the Canon didn't do thousands of times better.Overall, I think the camera's brilliant.

I purchased it because it had the best reviews of the point & shoot variety cameras and the digital camera I have is only a 4 megapixel & it was time to upgrade....or so I thought. I used it for a week and returned it for the following problems:1. It had an excruciatingly long shutter lag compared to my \"old\" kodak easy share. I couldn't ever get off shots in time to catch my 1 year old doing something cute. And, if she moved...like all kids do...the shots came out blurry. I even had it on the setting for kids and pets. Also I had the SDHC card in it.2. No matter what I did (yes, I read the manual) I kept getting photos that looked very poorly focused. Not even as crisp as my 4 megapixel.3. With the flash on, people were washed out, with it off, they were in dark shadows. There seemed no happy medium.4. The \"face finder\" feature made getting a shot off take too long.5. The color in photos seemed off...not natural.6. The menus just were not all that easy to follow or intuitive, at least to me, from other cameras I have used in the past.I have been taking photos for 25 years and am used to getting really great shots.

I chose to stick to a smaller size camera so I would take it with me most places instead of leaving the bigger camera at home. So even though I love all the features of the Canon Powershot SX10IS 10MP it's just too big for me right now.First I would like to point out that this is a point and shoot camera, designed for everyday pictures and some advanced shots if you have the know how. We would all love to get the hand held digital camera that can take stunning SLR pictures but unfortunately that still doesn't exist. This camera with the right equipment and experience can come close though.I have to disagree with those that are saying the battery life is short. I have had very good battery runs, including the batteries that were supplied with the camera. So far this has been one of the best point and shoot cameras I have ever used. Here are my run downs:Pro:-Great image quality, I mean really superb. Can go to ISO 400 and still be a good enough to print pictures. After that your going to need some clean up with an editing software or \"noise\" will be too prevalent.-Fast response time from power up to shot. In between shots it depends on what level flash you use, the brighter the flash the longer it will take to recharge the flash. This problem, however, is in just about all cameras of this caliber. Even the sony and canon SX10 would take 5-7 seconds to recharge after a full flash was used. I have a sony alpha and that flash drains sometimes takes 4 or more seconds to catch up.-Great LCD. I have it at half brightness and it's more than enough in almost any situation.-Easy to learn operation, don't believe me, just set it to easy and it'll do all the work and be right most of the time.-Nice solid feel to it.-Prints have been excellent and full of color.Cons: -I wish the f/stop would go below 2.8. That's just me maybe.-Even though I know the flash will take a few seconds to recharge, I wish someone could come up with a way to make that faster. It would save some missed pictures.All in all it's a great camera. Easy to use and not so bulky that you won't take it with you everywhere. I carry mine in belt pouch and have been lucky I had it for some great pictures, that yes would have looked slightly better with my dslr, but I wouldn't have gotten them at all if I didn't carry my dslr with me.Highly recommend it and am probably going to get one for my wife so she'll stop taking mine.", "Date": "November 27, 2008"}, {"Title": "Great camera, unless you get lens errors", "Author": "S.

This is alright for me b/c I use low res for mostly emails and 4x6 prints, however may not be good for people who like to take pics in higher resolutions.  The other flaw is the SLOW flash recycle, you could miss out on some good pics bc of this.

I do have some minor points to add, however. I am using this camera for more than a month now, and overall I am very pleased, even though a few things does bother me.First of all, I miss the wide angle zoom. Canon released the G10 and the SX10 (20x super zoom) at the same time along with the SX110, the other 2 got the wide-angle lens, but not the SX110. Why? I would anytime pick a wide-angle and 9x zoom over the 10x zoom.Also, Canon features the new Digic 4 processor on the other 2 cameras, while in the SX110 it is still the older Digic III. It's not bad, but I would appreciate the newer technology with the i-Contrast and more.The SX10 (with 20x zoom) lets you zoom (optical) during video recording; However with the SX110 (and G10) you can't zoom (only with the useless digital zoom).The biggest problem, as many others pointed out, is the flash recharging time. I had several Canon's in the past (point & shoot), and have never encountered such a big delay between shots (when using flash).I am upgrading from the PowerShot SD700, which was much faster between shots. The battery also lasted much longer. In overall, I am from those who appreciate Canon's battery pack over AA, even though I can not ignore the benefits of AA availability - and this is true even with the rechargeable AA's - I just don't like them.A major drawback for me was when I found out that there is no battery meter. One of the things I hated in my older SD700 was the lack of a battery meter (it only notifies you when the battery is dead to replace it, no prior notice), and I was happy to see that since the release of the PowerShot SD1100 Canon added the battery meter so you always know how much juice you have left. I was looking forward for that on the SX110 as well... Well, I was wrong. Seems that Canon is unable to meter third party (AA) batteries! What a disappointment!I also think that there is not enough grip. I would like the battery compartment a tad bigger, and some added rubber. The way it's now, it's a bit slippery. Also, the battery/card door is a little difficult to open and requires an extra unnecessary step of pulling a little piece before opening.Another problem is the placement of the little speaker. I find it always covered with my left hand! The area on top left is a natural place for the fingers to sit; the speaker does not belong on this spot!About the 3.0\" LCD - when I first got my SX110, I was surprised at the nice 3.0\" LCD - until I compared it to the 3.0\" LCD of the Canon G10 which my friend bought at the same time - what a difference! The resolution is so much better on the G10, with double the amount of pixels (460,000 instead of the 230,000 on the SX110). (By the way, the new professional Canon EOS 50D has even double the pixels of the G10, for an unbelievable total of 920,000!!)Also important to note, that this camera does not feature the \"EDIT MOVIE\" feature which most other Canon cameras does. That means no more cropping beginning/end of your clips! I really miss that!Otherwise, I think this is an excellent overall camera. I am really impressed with the pictures, and they're better than the SD700, especially in lower light conditions. The image stabilizer also works a lot better. So much more flexible and all the controls are so useful. Manual raise/close flash is excellent and makes it very easy to control flash ON/OFF (and it's beyond me why they didn't the same on the G10); the face detection works great, and it will never overexpose a human face even with flash close to the face - which my old SD770 was terrible at it. Noise appears in higher ISO or in dim light conditions, but usually in most situations it's perfect, and definitely better than previous Canon's.

I am frankly amazed at the flexibility and image quality from a camera at this price point that fits in your pocket. I find myself grabbing it whenever I go for a walk. At a store I compared it to the Panasonic TZ5 and a Nikon super zoom in the same price range. In shots without flash the Canon had far better image quality. (The TZ5 is nifty, but the image quality is mediocre: Its noise reduction really smears the colors.)The 10X zoom lens is great if you don't mind a small amount of fringing on high contrast edges. The controls are logically laid out and easy to use, yet there is comprehensive manual controls if you need it. The image sharpening is a little overdone for my taste: I recommend shooting in P mode using a custom color profile with the sharpening turned down to the lowest level. The problem is that Canon chose to go light on the noise reduction (a decision with which I agree), but the default sharpening tends to turn low-level noise into \"spiky\" artifacts.I wasn't expecting much from the video mode, but I must admit that it does well, even in low light conditions, and the sound is surprisingly good. It is a nuisance that you cannot adjust the optical zoom in video mode, since the digital zoom really degrades image quality.It obviously still has a relatively small sensor with limited dynamic range, so don't expect silky smooth DSLR-like images at medium/low lighting, but at reasonable light levels the images are beautiful.Highly recommended.", "Date": "November 1, 2008"}, {"Title": "Great pictures, poor build", "Author": "Drifter", "ReviewID": "R7C1SSAKKYLUV", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "This camera probably has the best zoom lens among point and shoots under 300 bucks.

I have had Canon products for many years (was a professional) and decided to stick with them.This camera is absolutley amazing. The PQ is outstanding as is the video quality. I was blown away by that.We recently had a snow storm and I took night photos (tripod) and the photos were excellent. I then took more photos the next morning and they were outstanding. The photos were of trees with heavy snow on one side. Great contrast between the snow and the bark. The trees were about 30 - 200 feet away. And all photos were taken through a window! They almost appeared to be HD quality. If anyone doubts this, I will gladly email you some samples.The camera is feature packed and some have complained about this (too many settings). My advice would be to get a cheaper digital that you may feel is easier. But for a novice it is still a great camera since you can put it on full 'auto' and get exceptional photos. Then you can learn at your pace. But I would recommend this camera just for the PQ alone.A friend of mine had a new Olympus and after seeing this camera and it's PQ, they returned the Olympus and bought this one.Pros: - EverythingCons: - NoneLet me address some other users \"cons\".* Poor battery life - This camera has excellent battery life. I had an older HP digital and the batteries kept dying after about 30 shots, then 20, then 10 then nothing. I thought it was the camera. Turns out it was the batteries. I was using a fast charger (30') and that killed them. I educated myself about batteries and found that you need a good charger that is capable of charging at different rates. The fast chargers are harmful and will prematurely end the batteries life.My friend who had the Olympus had the same problem. New batteries and was only getting about 30 photos. She thought it was the camera. I took her batteries and charged them in the Maha C9000 charger and after the first charge, she got over 180 photos (test) with the same batteries.GET A GOOD BATTERY CHARGER AND YOU WILL SEE A MAJOR DIFFERANCE WITH ANY DEVICE.Another 'con' mentioned was about poor indoor shooting quality. The camera has an 'indoor' mode that takes away the tungsten lighting effect and gives great PQ. Of course you still need the flash. I took photos of Grandchildren moving indoors and the PQ was great again. Even without the \"indoor\" setting the PQ was great.As mentioned, I was blown away about the PQ of video. It was THAT good. Granted, if you put the setting on \"320\" which is the setting for emailing, then you will see some PQ degradation. But on the upper quality settings it is outstanding. With a 2GB memory card, you can get about 18' of video on the highest quality setting. About 45' on the lowest setting.Of course, the camera, will have features you will never use, but it's merits are the PQ and overall features. The macro setting is excellent also. You can get within a 1/2\" of the object. The detail it shows is terrific also.As you can see, I can't rave enough about this camera. I do NOT work for Canon or have any affiliation with them. It's just that I am that pleased with this camera.A word on their customer support. Great!I emailed them with a question AFTER I bought the camera (locally). Their Web site says they will get back to you within 24 hours. I was skeptical. Were talking CANON, not Mom & Pop.They answered me in 12 hours!Great camera... just remember to educate yourself on batteries. This is important.

The same shot took seven seconds using the flash. In general the actual image capture process is slow on this camera.- Picture quality issues.You can take a decent picture with this camera but odds are you will not be doing it in auto-mode. In particular I find ISO settings above 100 produce very grainy, noisy pictures. I tend to use this camera in either \"P-mode\" or \"M-mode\" 99% of the time so I can manually set the ISO value to 80. If you always shoot in perfect lighting, or can use a flash maybe this may not be an issue but really you should be able to use higher ISO values without noise totally dominating the picture.- Construction quality.The construction of this camera makes it feel somewhat fragile, like I was cradling an egg needing to be super cautious. I kind of wonder at the durability of this unit. Maybe others who have had one longer can comment.Overall I think this camera had some pluses, and some definite minuses.

With that said, there are a couple of things you should know when un-boxing the system. First of all, the measly 32mb memory card you receive is just about worthless. Plan on purchasing a 8gb card. They can be had for about $15 and if you take many photos or any videos you will be glad you did.Also, my camera's video setting came out of the box in the \"compact\" mode, which in my option produces unusable video. Change it to the standard video/640 30fps (page 89 in the User Guide). While this still will not provide you with HD video, it is acceptable for causal shooting. However, the included 32mb memory card will only hold about 15 seconds of video at this setting.Now for the important part. For the price point, this camera would be extremely hard to beat! The features are numerous and quite amazing. I took a picture of an object so far away I could hardly make it out, at full optical and digital zoom and the results were unbelievable. However, I must say I did enhance the photo a bit in Photoshop. You could probably do the same in just about any photo software program, even the one that comes with the camera.I can't say I found any \"cons\" with this camera. Since I take causal and semi-professional photographs in my web designing business, I wanted a camera that was compact yet provided excellent results. If I wasn't concern with the size, I would have likely purchased a SX10 IS or XS1 IS, but for what I need the SX110 IS is more than adequate.However, as others have mentioned the camera does eat a steady supply of batteries. Either buy your AAs in bulk or goes the rechargeable route. I didn't call the camera's energy requirement a con, because I like the big, bright and beautiful LCD and other power hungry features.

Lord \"Picture Lady\"", "ReviewID": "R13PBBBBSMCVN6", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "When I make any kind of purchase, I like to research EVERYTHING.  What I was looking for in a camera:- Higher megapixels - in the 10 MP range- Bigger zoom- manual modes - to help me prepare to tackle an SLR- double A batteries: because that's what I had, and I have a terrible fear of running out of battery power- reasonable pricing - less than $250I checked out models in stores, and researched them online extensively.  I narrowed it down to three choices: Canon SX 110, Nikon L100, and Panasonic Lumix TZ 5.The Nikon L100 was the first to fall, because for more money, it does less -- it is best for a person that wants to take good pictures without putting in much effort, or taking time to learn about adjusting different values (aperature, shutter speed, white balance, etc).  It's a basic point and shoot - with a nice zoom - in a heavy casing that looks like it should do more than it does.  This would be great for some people - like my parents - but not what I was looking for.  Also, the L100 takes double As, but not rechargables.  This really disappointed me.  The next step for Nikon seemed to be the P90, with manual modes and more control, but also out of my budget range.  I would consider the P90 as a possible SLR replacement.  Overall, I was disappointed that Nikon didn't offer a mid-range camera, somewhere between the L100 and P90.As for the Panasonic TZ5, I discovered that camera in a shop and considered it mostly because it has a Leica lens, a famous lens renowned for its quality.  Added bonus: wide angle lens, 28 mm, unusual on a point and shoot, good for indoor shooting.  First downside: no double As - so I'd have to put out extra expense for a back up battery.  I eventually rejected this camera because it had no manual modes - although it did have extensive scene modes I was accustomed to from my other point and shoot - and I decided I really wanted that feature.  Also, the 10x zoom was extremely unstable -- I was not impressed by the lack of clarity when I took pictures indoors at full zoom and had trouble holding it steady enough with my own hands.  Carrying a tripod everywhere is not really an option.  Additionally, I checked out a website touted by another reviewer, and noticed that the TZ5 picture quality in low lighting was not comparable to its Canon equivalent.Which leads me to the camera I chose - even without being able to test it in the stores!  This was the only camera I didn't try until it arrived in the mail - and my purchase was completely justified.  I chose the camera for its manual modes (Manual, AV, TV, P), for its 10x zoom and for its 9 MP.  I was unprepared for how much I would enjoy those manual settings -- now I know why people love SLRs!  I've been able to take pictures previously impossible on a point and shoot.  Even on this camera, taking a picture in auto mode (still good) just doesn't compare to the human calculation behind a picture taken in another mode where every setting can be perfectly adjusted.  I took the camera into Philadelphia one night for some night shooting and was pleased with the clear results.  Also, the image stabilization - a problem in the TZ5 - is excellent in the Canon SX 110 -- clear pictures, no matter the zoom.  I never use digital zoom, and would never have recommended it at all before this camera, but surprisingly, this camera produces a clear image at 40x zoom, the max (keep in mind you won't be able to print super large, but 4x6 would still be fine).Before receiving and testing the camera, I was worried about lag time with the flash.  I read that it took several seconds to reboot.  But I have not had a problem so far.  Some modes - night specifically - take longer to store and adjust the image, but this has never gotten in the way of my picture taking.I never expected to be this impressed with my purchase - and I never expected to convert to Canon (I've always been a Nikon girl).  But I couldn't be happier.  Only trouble I've had so far is that sometimes in macro focus and at the 10x zoom, I've had some trouble focusing on objects that blend in with backgrounds - no surprise there.  Pretty standard for point and shoot.  It just takes a little time to refocus - patience!The manual flash clears out extra menu hopping, and I adjusted easily.Overall, this is the best camera I could have bought to meet my needs and budget.", "Date": "August 18, 2009"}, {"Title": "Very good, but not perfect.", "Author": "Julian Velasco", "ReviewID": "R3DQ0PMMQDKZCF", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I've had this camera for about 9 months, I've purchased quite a few cameras in the past few years, and I take pictures daily (literally!).

But I'm still not fully satisfied, and I keep looking for something better.PROS:* AA batteries: you never have to worry about running out of juice.* 10X zoom, with a decent lens.* Small size, for a super-zoom.* 9MP -- I don't really care for more.  In fact, I'd happily take less.* Face-detection auto-focus.* Image quality is very good in good lighting.CONS:* A little big for a compact -- but what can you expect from a super-zoom?* Flash must be lifted manually.  (Really?!)* A little slow shot-to-shot, especially with flash.* Somewhat cheap feel, especially the battery door.* Poor automatic ISO settings: often too high or too low.* Image quality is fine, but not good, in low lighting / high ISO.* DIGIC 3 instead of DIGIC IV (older technology).Obviously, a compact point & shoot requires compromise, and this camera does as good a job of striking a balance as one could reasonably expect, especially at its price point.  Most people would love it.  But what I really want -- and I think most regular people do, too -- is a good low-light camera for indoors photography.  This is not it.  It's as good as the next camera, but that's not good enough.Final thoughts: Anyone considering this camera should at least look at the SX200 IS.  When I bought this camera, I also considered the Canon Powershot SD990, but it doesn't have enough zoom for me.  And I'm currently lusting after the Fujifilm Finepix F200EXR, which has a much larger CCD and should be better indoors; but it also has much less zoom (a barely-enough 5X) and has gotten mixed reviews.

After all that, I've reached the conclusion that most \"expert\" camera reviews are mostly written by pros who typically review nuances most of us won't care about.As the proud parent of a toddler, I'm convinced the real test of a camera's capabilities is simply \"how well does it handle indoor shots of a fast moving toddler?\"Well I'm happy to report that after 4 weeks of heavy use, this camera performs much better than my old Canon Powershot SD1000 (Elph) camera.  But having said that, it does require a bit of fiddling with camera controls to get GREAT results.  It's not very complicated really, just take plenty of test-shots and see which camera modes work best for your environment:Maybe you're at a wedding, and you're not allowed to use the flash.  Well, the telephoto zoom lens with good indoor lighting should be fine.  (The zoom lens is a bit slow to fully extend, but once extended...whoa! Amazing clarity!)  I found power-on time acceptable at about 2 seconds.Maybe you don't want to carry a camcorder, but want the ability to take up to 1 hour-long videos.  Well there are two vides modes , 30 and 15 frames per second.  (I know the Quicktime MOV format is gaining popularity among the HD-video crowd, but I prefer the ease of AVI format which can be easily played/edited on most computers - no additional software required.)Maybe you want to compare your customized settings with the Canon's pre-programmed modes.  Well there are 13 automatic scene modes, plus another 4 traditional manual modes -- and a large crisp LCD screen to view your results.But maybe, you're like my wife and just want to turn on the camera and start taking pictures.  Well, there are not 1, but 2 auto-modes (one of which is an \"Easy\" mode that disables buttons from accidentally being pushed).The point is that is an incredibly versatile camera.  Smaller to carry than the traditional UltraZoom cameras, but more feature rich than your traditional point-and-shoot cameras.PS- Forget any negative attention you might read about the battery life.  I put in a couple of rechargeable AA (2650 mAh) batteries, and they lasted for hundreds of shots over 10 days.", "Date": "April 14, 2009"}, {"Title": "Awesome - Practically a Pocket-size SLR", "Author": "Tripod", "ReviewID": "REG49JVHXWNSO", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Just came back from 9 week backpacking trip in Asia.  I usually use a Canon DSLR, but could not bring my SLR due to size, weight, worrying about its safety all the time, attracting too much attention, etc.However, if you're an SLR user like me, you miss all the professional functionality, versatility and most of all, zoom range when you settle for most point-and-shoot (PAS) cameras.The SX110 IS was my dream come true.  The 10x optical zoom makes all the difference... in 35mm terms you have a max focal length of 360mm -- like carrying a massive zoom lens on an SLR.  Can't count how many beautiful shots would have been impossible if I had been using an 5x zoom or less.Pros:- full creative modes (Av, TV, Manual, exposure adjustments) that are actually faster to adjust than my SLR, no fake \"Manual\" modes that lots of PAS's have, which are anything but Manual- (it's still got all the scene modes, e.g. Landscape, Action, Portrait, etc. and most of the common ones are on the main dial so you don't have to cycle through them onscreen to get them quickly if you're not comfortable with the creative modes)- lots of white balance options- you manually flip-up the flash, only when you want to use it... I hate it when cameras automatically decide for me when to pop-up and use the flash (or you have to cycle through the flash buttons to get control of them) ... I know whether I want flash or not dammit... also you can adjust the flash intensity (great for using light flash on daytime shots in the shade)- massive and beautiful 3-inch LCD- form factor... compared to others in its class, i.e. PAS's that have great zoom and full creative modes, this was the smallest -- it actually fits in your pocket (bizarrely I've seen a bunch of reviews that say it's too big for your pocket -- not true at all as long as you're not wearing ridiculously tight pants), unlike those PAS's (including a lot of Canons) that are, to me, in no-man's-land because they're too big for a PAS and too small, not enough lens quality and w/o lens interchangeability to be a SLR- has a jog dial! (like SLRs have)... so great, and not that many PAS's have it.  Let's you very quickly review/search through tons of photos, and quickly change shooting parameters like ISO, aperture, shutter speed, instead of pushing pushing pushing buttons to get what you want- the awesome Canon user interface -- I have tried all different brands and Canon is the best hands down- image stabilization seemed to work pretty wellCons:Big Cons - I do not like the AA battery as power source.  This camera chews up AA batteries like no other... on one day when I took about 250+ pictures I went through 8 AA batteries.  Granted:  I probably should have bought a rechargeable AA system before I left, never tried that and also, the batteries for sale in Asia are cheap but they are absolute crap (even Western brands, although they were probably knockoffs).  The high-quality $12 lithium AA's I bought in the US before I left lasted much longer, but still not that long.- the flash has to sit there and get recharged by the batteries before you can shoot again.  My guess is it takes about 3-5 seconds, which is an eternity when you're asking people to hold a pose or you've got a fleeting chance at a great photo opp... this actually caused me to miss a few good shots- video -- you cannot zoom in or out once you start filming!  I have no idea why not.  Also, the video quality options are that of cameras from a few years ago.. can't shoot in HD, and can't shoot at a super-high rate of frames per second like some tiny Elphs from years ago canSmall cons- can't shoot in RAW -- won't bother most people since most people just shoot JPGs but I will be moving to RAW soon- a bit slow to focus, I have definitely seen better in lots of PAS cameras- face detection was not as good as some other PAS's I've seen -- slow to recognize faces if it even recognized them at all -- although not a huge deal for me as I never rely on face detection to focus- in the display review, there are four displays to cycle through -- the 4th is a \"focus check\" which zooms on the center of the photo (or face if detected).  It's pointless -- it does nothing more than what you do anyway to check focus when you do a standard review, you zoom in using the zoom buttons and move around the picture to see what you want to check -- except it adds extra cumbersome steps.  Canon should get rid of this -- all I want when I cycle through review display modes is the 3rd display -- to check the histogram and see what the camera chose if I'm not in full Manual (i.e. what ISO if I'm using auto-ISO, what shutter speed if I'm using aperture-priority, etc.)- would be nice to have an exposure bracketing feature, but this is something you almost never see on PAS's anywayAnyway, I gave this 5 stars, I couldn't have bought a better camera for my trip, but would have given it a 4.5 if possible due to the above issues... HOWEVER, I see now that Canon has already fixed some of this in a new model called the SX200 IS, which has rechargeable lithium ion battery, more megapixels, HD video and more zoom (although I believe this is deceiving since the 35mm equivalent is actually lower than the SX110, maybe the SX200 has a smaller sensor?  Anyway the upside is you have a wider angle shot when not zoomed).In summary I highly recommend this camera.", "Date": "April 9, 2009"}, {"Title": "Fantastic Camera - Canon Powershot SX110IS", "Author": "W.

The 10X Optical Zoom is amzing.  I take mostly outdoor pictures, so the fact that I need to flip my the flash is not a factor for me.  I do not take many indoor action pictures so that 10 second recharge of the flash is not an issue for me.

B., NA \"lestasha2\"", "ReviewID": "RGHFC9WZ6LW1Z", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I'm basically a point and shoot guy, but I have enjoyed changing camera settings and dabbling a little bit in taking pictures of individual tropical fish in my aquarium, which is somewhat of a chore.  Last year I bought a Sony H7 to replace my Canon A85.  Though I could get good fish pictures after much reading and fiddling around, I was terribly disappointed and frustrated by the Sony's inability to take good indoor pictures using the automatic settings.  I always had to go through the long process of editing the brightness and color of my pictures and even then was not always happy.  I now have the Canon SX110 and am very happy with it.  Here's my take on a comparison of it to my old camera.Things I really like about my Canon SX110 compared to my Sony H7 and others . . .1. Blur check feature on playback setting2. The mode dial doesn't get accidentally turned as easy and mess up my pictures!!!!3. The auto setting puts out better picture color in florescent light than the Sony did!!!4. The auto setting chooses a lower ISO (200 vs 400) in low light giving less grainy pictures than the Sony!!5. The view screen is bigger and has more pixels making it easier to tell if my printed results will be satisfactory!!6. Image stabilization seems to work better than with the Sony7. This camera is small enough to carry on my belt, in my coat pocket, or in my wife's purse8. The cheaper price (counting a case, batteries, and cards, I spent $220 versus around $3009. The lense cover is automatic instead of having to remember to take it off and put it on.10. The manual settings are more easily navigated- e.g.the 2 click process to change ISO or face detection11. Ability to erase a picture with two button pushes rather than three12. The Program mode will hold it's settings even if you have changed the ISO, aperature, or shutter speed while in Manual mode (I missed good pictures because the Sony changed settings across the board)The few things I don't like about my Canon SX110 compared to my Sony H7 and others . . .1. The flash does not pop up automatically2. The flash does not recharge as quickly3. The zoom is shorter4. There is no neck strap, but instead just a wrist strap5. The memory card is inside the battery compartment so batteries can easily fall out while removing the card.Concerning the flash, I just have to get in the habit of putting it up like I had to get in the habit of taking off the lens cap with the Sony.  If I forget, the camera does tell me.  Concerning the recharge time, I have to live with that, but you can take a non flash picture while waiting and there is some benefit to being able to use AA Alkalines in a pinch and cheap rechargeables the rest of the time.  Concerning the zoom, I have yet to miss it and can always cut and crop.  When I did zoom the full 15x on my Sony it seemed I always had color output and exposure problems anyway.  Concerning the lack of a neck strap, a good camera bag will have one and you can add one to your camera too if you can find one like I had from a Sandisk flash drive.  Concerning the battery compartment, I've found it easiest to hook the camera to the computer using the USB cord that I just leave attached to the computer, and that's a small price to pay for the ease of getting good picture output.  On the same note, it would have been nice if the cord attached to the camera on the side opposite the grip of the camera.A few other features some may dislike or miss with the Canon vs the Sony1. The battery life is shorter2. There is no viewfinder to use in bright light or to help conserve battery power3. The flash is not as powerfulBut none of the above bother me in the least.  It's easy to carry extra Nimh AA batteries and I never used the viewfinder with my Sony to begin with nor on the other digital camera I had before it.  As for the flash, even though I envision that I would use the extra power occasionally and did try it a few times with the Sony, that occasion is too rare to worry about.  I was never happy with Sony's \"green\" and grainy output in such circumstances, so that makes it easier not to miss.  Besides, Canon does sell an add on flash that one can use with this camera if he sees a need for it.A few other features some may like about the Canon versus the Sony1. On the fly red eye removal2. The well chosen scene setting selections available with the twist of the dial and others easily accessible3. The more popular and universal SD memory card versus Sony's propriety MS Pro Duo card4. The easy setting that requires no camera know how except to pop up the flash, point, and shootThat does it for a review from the perspective of a simple point and shoot guy.  I hope it can help someone make the choice that will best meet their needs on the first try, instead of having to buy two cameras like I did.

And I wanted a stronger zoom for wildlife shots.  I wanted something pocket/purse size to keep with me, which ruled out the SLRs, and this seemed to have both the size and the zoom capability I wanted.  It does.  And it's so slightly larger than the older camera that I can still use the same protective case (by Pentax, not Canon).However...It has taken some time to get used to its differences from the A520 (some more, some less convenient).One of the elements that I don't like is that the SD card slot is in the same compartment as the batteries, so I have to be very careful not to dump the batteries out when I'm removing or changing the card.  I need either an extra finger or two, or a lap, available to hold them while I'm manipulating everything else.Also, I often find the DC-in/AV-out compartment cover ajar.  Whether it opens upon being brushed or bumped or whether it simply doesn't latch firmly, I haven't yet determined.  I'm concerned because it appears flimsy enough to break off without much effort.As others have mentioned, there is no viewfinder on this camera.  I was used to using a viewfinder but have had no difficulty adapting to using the screen.  I must admit, however, that I haven't tried to use it on days bright enough to potentially make viewing the screen difficult.  I tend to shoot during the golden hours or with angled lighting rather than in strong sunlight so haven't given that an adequate test.I expected the stabilization to work better than it seemed to at first, as I shot casual critter shots.  Then I discovered the setting for \"children and pets.\"  That has helped considerably.  Practice and experimentation will no doubt teach me to use the camera more effectively in other ways, as well, in the months ahead.By the way, I don't like the Canon Zoombrowser software at all.

Over the past month, I've been able to really test it out, and it hasn't let me down even once.The 10x optical zoom is not a 10x digital zoom, it is true optical zoom with excellent lenses. Some of the other 10x (mega-zoom) camera were reviewed to have poor exposure results through their lenses, surprisingly this included Nikon. The Canon performance is awesome. The effective pixels total 9 mega-pixels, plenty of pixel density on a .28cm sensor. The main sensor is a CCD type that measures 0.28 sq cm. There is a huge LCD on the back and the screen is awesome with lots of detail and a built-in portrait-to-landscape accelerometer (orientation sensor). The flash is manual which means you just flip the flash up if the display says you need it; leave it down if you don't need it--no fumbling for buttons to set the flash preference. I haven't be disappointed by the shots I've taken on auto yet. With face detection, just a light touch on the exposure button, the face detection senses the faces in your shot and focuses perfectly. Then mash the button and get a great shot every time. Easy to learn right out of the box. Nothing complicated about this camera. If you want aperture or shutter priority, you'll have to spend more. This camera is the best value I was able to find for the features and I've been really impressed with the quality of the prints that I've made on top-quality photo paper. The video is awesome, even on a 52\" plasma. We're using this camera exclusively and pretty much shelved our Canon DV video camera.The research that informed my choice included Amazon reviews, JR Photo reviews, Consumer Reports, Digital Camera Review, Canon Web site, Nikon Web site and the Sony Web site. In my research, I looked at the most critical things that mattered to me. Sensor size and mega-pixels ratings can be confusing and deceiving. The higher the number doesn't necessarily mean better shots, especially if you're comparing a compact with a subcompact. I used the buying guide at Digital Camera Review extensively to narrow down to the compacts with the best performance features and to make sure I was comparing apples to apples.I compared camera in the Consumer Reports ratings, and though I found that they didn't seem to pay much attention to CCD sensor size in their ratings, as always, the review was very informative and helped narrow down the top brands for features, performance and reliability.Once I had a narrowed down list of a few cameras that looked like they had the best mix of features, performance, usability, price and quality, the clear winner was this Canon. Plus the fact that I have had excellent experiences with other Canon electronics, I chose the SX110.Bottom line, this camera takes great pictures and video. I've photographed and shot video at the max of 60 feet from my subject with excellent results. I've photographed in low light, too, and as long as you're relatively still, great results with minimal blur. I've been amazed at how much I've been able to shoot without the flash. The flash does produce some red-eye, but it is possible to fix it with a feature right on the camera. I use a Mac Book Pro with iPhoto, and the compatibility is ideal. I'm sure the same is true with PCs.The first shot delay is almost not even noticeable; very quick and second shot recovery after using the flash is great.I also recommend getting a 4GB memory card and a Sanyo Eneloop 4 Pack AA NiMH Pre-Charged Rechargable Batteries w/ Charger.", "Date": "January 10, 2009"}, {"Title": "Professional for Non-Professional Cost!", "Author": "A.

If your setting are right, you don't need the flash on most the time, unless most of your shooting is done in low/dark light. Frankly, i rarely use the flash unless i'm in that kind of light setting and my pictures look better for it.I would NOT recommend this camera for the first time, or casual picture-taker. This camera is best suited for someone who has a growing interest in taking better pictures because while you're learning to use the more advanced features (which takes time and practice) you can still take great shots in the \"auto\" setting.THREE NEGATIVES:1. It's somewhat heavy (which i don't mind but you might).2. Also, when you DO use the flash, the viewing delay time is pretty significant. What I mean is as soon as you take a picture with the flash on you will have to wait atleast four seconds to take another picture.3. There is no eye viewer (i'm sure that's not the correct term).

When I decided to get a digital camera, I had a lot of very specific criteria I was looking for, and I did a lot of research.  Indeed, not finding any camera that met these criteria kept me from \"going digital\" for several years.In the SX110IS, it seemed I had finally found what I was looking for -- a compact digital camera with a built-in flash, that I could use to take multiple trial shots of displays before committing them to actual film.  I wanted something light and portable.  I wanted the option to auto-focus or manual focus; this camera offers both.  I wanted the choice of a full-manual mode; this camera has it.  I wanted a significant amount of /optical/ zoom; the SX110 IS comes through again.Especially important to me was the battery situation.  I own a Sony digital camera in which a replacement battery-pack costs more than the camera is currently worth; I didn't want to get into that situation again.  That the SX110 IS runs on common AA batteries was a huge plus for me.  However, this boon is offset by the short life of batteries in this camera -- this thing eats batteries.  I got so that I wouldn't go to even an afternoon holiday get-together without bringing at least two sets of spare batteries, and I'd use them both.  If I used the flash a lot, I'd go through three sets of batteries in 2 hours.For a while I tried rechargeble batteries, which at least meant I didn't have to buy them in packs of 20, but they have an even shorter lifespan in the camera, going dead about 20% sooner than non-rechargables.Well, the battery situation was annoying, but not unmanagable.  The real problem, the one that made me rate the camera three-stars, rather than four or five, came later on.  I don't take a great number of flash pictures, and I usually keep the flash set on \"medium\", so I don't think I was taxing the unit beyond reasonable expectations.  Yet after less than a year, the flash quit working, suddenly, and completely.  I took the camera into a camera shop, and the repairman got it working again by \"cleaning\" something in the camera.Just about a year later, the flash quit working again.  This time, the local repair shop said they couldn't fix it, so I sent it in to Canon, with the $111 fee they estimated it would cost to repair it.  After about a month, not having heard back from them, I e-mailed the company, and was told that \"parts were no longer available\" for this camera, and they suggested I \"upgrade\" -- at a certain cost, of course.Well, none of their suggested \"upgrades\" (all of which are refrubished, used cameras) have the selection of features for which I purchased the SX110 IS.  They're either bigger, heavier, don't have the same selection of shooting modes, or use expensive, proprietary battery packs instead of commonly available batteries.More to the point, I am astonished that a camera, purchased new from the company, and barely 2-years old can't be repaired because /parts are no longer available/.  How can that be?I can buy parts for a 22 year old car in any auto parts store.  I just repaired a 15-year old refrigerator, with no trouble.  I have a 75-year old DLR camera that the local shop can still maintain.  But the /manufacturer/ can't get parts for one of their own products, less than 3-years old?That kind of thing is a deal-breaker for me.

Just for context:  I am an amateur, mostly taking pictures of family, friends, and outdoor scenes.  However I have been taking pictures for at least 20 years and have used digital cameras (previously Nikon Coolpix) for at least the past 5, so I do have experience.  I am really enjoying this camera.  Here are some points:Pros:1. Nice feel in your hands; solid but light and small enough to take everywhere - which I do.  I have back problems so I wanted something lightweight but with reasonable zoom, and I have no problem carrying this around.2.  Great optical zoom, really fun to use, works great3.  I personally love the fact that you manually raise the flash - less redeye concern and it gives you more control.  I've heard people say they forget to lower it, but I can't imagine having this problem:  it's staring you in the face!4.  Takes great pictures with wonderful color!5.  LCD screen is beautiful and really a pleasure to use6.  Very convenient with controls which are pretty intuitive and easy to use, although reading the manual first makes a big difference!7.

The battery and memory card sit in the same housing and the cover is awkward/tough to open, I anticipate that it will break at some point, which I know can happen because I've had that happen before with other cameras.3.

The flash takes a long time to charge, but the batteries last a long time.The problem is that after less then two months the shutter release button fell off. It continued to work fine so we hesitated to loose it for a couple weeks for service. Then the camera started giving intermittent lens error messages. When we sent it in for warranty service they refused service on the basis there was damage. They also claimed the button \"just doesn't fall off\".  When the camera was returned not repaired because I refused to pay half the purchase price, I had to search very hard to find the damage. It is very small and barely noticeable.  In my discussions with Canon they claim quality products with very low product failure rate, but in my experience they do their best to find fault with the customer rather then provide support for the few products that need service.

Benn \"katiebean\"", "ReviewID": "RLZ0M3ES3N3G6", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I bought this camera to take with me to a concert I went to back in february.  I knew that I was in the 6th row, so I needed a good zoom, and I needed something with fairly low noise at high ISOs because of the indoor lighting.  I also needed something that was fairly low in price.After much searching I decided on this little gem of a camera, and boy am I glad I did!Some of the things I love about this camera:It's compact.  I was looking at the sx10is which is a bit of an upgrade, but ultimately the compactness of the 110 won me over.It's inexpensive.  At least as far as cameras go.  I make very little money with my part time job, so I was looking for something that wouldn't break the bank and for about $[...] you can't argue with this.You can set most everything manually.  This came in great handy at the concert when I needed a quicker shutter speed than the pre-set settings wanted to give me.  I also like knowing that I can control the image instead of just pushing a button and hoping for the best.Beautiful 3in screen.  Very lovely to use and very clear.Manual flash.  I hate hate hate built in flash for anything other than when you're taking a quick snapshot of you and a friend at night, so this was very convenient for me.  I could flip up the flash when I wanted it, and when I didn't it would stay down.Pretty nice in low lighting.  At the concert there was very little light on stage so I cranked the ISO up to 800 and was happy with the amount of noise.  It was still there, but it wasn't distracting like on some other cameras.Nice video quality.  I wasn't sure of the video quality when I bought it and was hoping for the best at my concert where I know lots of videos get overwhelmed with the bass.  Luckily, it didn't sound like a bomb was going off at every beat.  The sound isn't as good (in my opinion) as the sx10, but it's still pretty good.  The video is also pretty high quality.10x optical zoom.  I.  Love.  This.  The whole trip I took while seeing the concert was filled with me playing around with the zoom from our 9th story hotel room.  There was a group of police officers talking with a man directly across the street from our hotel and you could literally read their name badges from how close it could zoom in.Now for some things that I don't like so much.First of all, the screen has no protection so it's easily scratched if it's not in a case whenever it's not being used.  This is a turn off for me only because I'm the kind of person who likes to throw stuff into my bag and be on my way without worrying about it getting scratched up, or having to worry about the bulkiness of a case.  This is by no means a reason to not buy the camera as this problem is easily remedied by keeping the camera in a small case or using a screen protector.Next is that you can't use the optical zoom while taking movies.  This bothers me because I really like to take video at concerts and it's a pain if you set the zoom wrong at the beginning of a video and can't change it throughout.On that note, it's also VERY easy to switch from \"standard\" video mode to \"compact\" mode.  Compact mode is a considerably lower resolution than standard and is closer to the resolution on a camera phone than the much higher quality of the standard mode.  This has happened to me on at least two occasions and I couldn't figure out how it was happening until too late.  It can easily change if the wheel located near the right thumb is moved while the camera is in movie mode.  This is the one flaw that is causing me to give the camera 4 stars instead of 5 (I'm still bitter about the footage I lost because of it).  This, however, can become a non problem if you're aware of how it can happen and how to fix it if it does happen.To wrap this up, the sx110is is an excellent camera if you want an awesome zoom, and good quality images on a budget.  I will definitely continue to use this as a non DSLR concert/everyday camera far into the future!EDIT: I tried to leave some links to pictures and video I took with this camera, but apparently I can't do links in a review.

It's hard to pick a camera, so I decided since I liked what I had, just wanted more zoom and more pixel, why not stick with Canon PowerShot?  A wise choice.  I am in amateur photography heaven with the choice.Zoom is all you can handle without tripod. Works good enough to catch the glint on the eye of a deer across our pond.  Details include tongues of baby robins being fed worms before their eyes are open.  Individual hairs on feathers of birds 50-60 feet away.  All with auto-focus point and shoot ease.  And fantastic macro capability on the other end of the spectrum.Batteries last as long as the 4 required in my last camera, but only takes 2 AAs.  Since I bought a relative inexpensive half-hour battery recharger set, cost of batteries will be free after a month or two of shooting.  Something I recommend. If you travel, then buy batteries to avoid carrying the charger.No lens replacement capability of a SLR, but I don't need that. One camera fits all my needs, inside and out, landscape and portrait, nature and still life, passive and action shots, in the light or dark.AND THIS CANON POWERSHOT FITS IN MY SHIRT POCKET.Image stabilization great for this grandpa shooting grandkids, flowers, and animals.The only thing I regret about this camera is the fact that I waited until the other camera died before I made my purchase.

It really captures the needs of a lot of different users, from great advanced features and access to setting modification for those who like to dabble with the outcome of their shots, to a large and vibrant display that will satisfy any mom or pop at Jonny's soccer game.  Over time, Canon has trimmed its on-board buttons and menus down to a VERY useable and accessible set, now rivaling the super-easy to use (but not very high quality) Kodak line of point and shooters. The picture quality on this guy rivals my Canon 30D's quality on automatic settings in both incandescent indoor shooting as well as outdoor shooting, but have not put the high ISOs to the test. The face detection feature is really nice; it does a nice job of picking up on the faces in a shot, so you do not have to try to manually focus.  Again, very nice for Gramma to take great looking shots.It seems like there had been a boom in DSLR sales in the past few years, with people forking out WAY too much cash for more camera than they need (and end up using in the long run).  If you are one of those folks who are tempted to get into photography \"more seriously,\" but really don't have the money to spend on a number of lenses (let alone a decent body), or the time for classes at your local tech school,  this is a really nice camera to consider.  The 10x optical zoom, rarely before seen on a sub-$200 camera, can give you some added push in your shots.  If you insist on \"looking cooler\" with a big camera that (until you learn its nuances) will yield shots of equal quality to this one in automatic mode, then I'd recommend staying in the Canon family, with a Rebel product or even a 40 or 50D.  Canon really does the best job for the money.The ONLY minute detail that I would point out to the negative would be the fact that small size coupled with the smooth rounded edges makes it just a bit difficult to grab and shoot if you have big paws like I do.

demonstrate some of the features.

To help consumers judge the quality, I will also post a few images on the main product page.  This camera has so many features and settings that it take owners a while to learn them; however, if you want to do more than take standard snapshots, you will appreciate the camera's versatility.Note:  This silver Canon SX100IS is the same as the black model, just with a different housing.Recommended purchases:  Toshiba 8GB High Speed SDHC Memory Card, 12 ENERGIZER RECHARGEABLE AA / AAA BATTERIES + CHARGER-- Debbie Lee Wesselmann", "Date": "August 10, 2009"}, {"Title": "Amazing zoom and clarity for a relatively small digital!", "Author": "Lisa Papp \"faerie-at-heart\"", "ReviewID": "R1EL8TFTO0XXPM", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "We were impressed by the amount this camera can zoom in on objects and still maintain clarity.

Canon's face recognition technology is useful: whatever it does I am not sure, but portraits come out great. The camera's real asset is the long lens combined with image stabilization. 10x optical and 4x digital zoom, for a combined 40x zoom make amateur wildlife photography a possibility, which really can't be done with a point and shoot and until a few years back could only be done with SLRs with huge lenses.

I was amazed with the clarity and sharpness of each shot after I'd made the necessary manual F Stop and speed adjustments. Over the last two months I'd been experimenting with all the scene modes; indoor mode shots, kids & pets mode, night-snapshot mode, landscape and portrait modes. I wasn't as impressed with any one of them. The TV and AV modes don't impress me, however, if I don't want to use time making manual adjustments, TV and AV work fine. Don't expect your photos to be exceptionally sharp. I have yet to work with the P (Program mode). This Canon takes clear, steady movies. The sound is good, too. Just be careful...when you turn to movie mode and want to shoot in standard, turn the ring around the Func/set button. You'll get a readout, it tell you which mode you are in...Standard or Compact. Compact makes the movie small thereby emailing will go faster. But the compact mode gets blurry when watching it on the full screen computer or TV. I take my movies on Standard mode 640x480 30fps. By using that you'll get the clarity of almost HD movies. Oh, I use rechargeable Ni-MH AA batteries. I was in Denver, CO for three days last month and took 150 photos and three movies on one set of rechargeable AAs, and they still had juice in them when I got home. I also use a 16GB memory so I'll won't run out, but I do carry a 4GB SanDick ExtremeIII memory card as backup. Check the front page of this camera to see the closeup shot of a yellow flower I took last month.This Canon SX110IS is my fav. I'm going to purchase a Flip UltraHD camcorder, 120 minute. Both cameras will accompany me to San Miguel de Allende, Mexico in October when I go for my son's wedding. I'm aware that the Flip doesn't have image stabilizing, but my hand is Ultra Steady.

For a few months I was able to hold the outside sliding battery cover lock while closing, thus causing the inside white switch to be pushed toward the SD card, allowing power on.

Fairbanks", "ReviewID": "R17TFX3Q70REQP", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "When used outside in good light (or extremely bright indoor light, such as next to a window) it is an outstanding camera.  It can take high-quality shots of stills, portraits, and action shots.  The zoom is very effective at distance, and the settings can go from fully automatic to completely manual.  In the right light this camera can get professional-quality shots.However, indoors this camera is no better than a typical point and shoot camera that would fit in your pocket.  The flash is weak (even at the highest setting), and pictures without flash are almost impossible.  ISO greater than 200 is pointless as photos will be overcome by noise.  If all you plan to do is have people hold still while you take a picture from less than seven feet, then you'll be fine.  If you are trying to get action shots indoors, forget about it.This camera will gobble batteries faster than a pig runs to slops.  You'll be lucky to get fifty pictures out of a new set of alkaline batteries.  However, if you get a good set of rechargable batteries, you'll be overwhelmingly and pleasantly surprised by how many pictures you can get:  hundreds.  Go figure.  I have four rechargable batteries.  I use two at a time, and can easily take 500 pictures before having to recharge.The flash is very slow to recycle, so again, indoor shots with this camera are slow and annoying.The camera is very reasonably priced.  I paid two Benjamins for it new and have taken a couple thousand photos already.  The colors are brilliant and popping, but realistic.  Like I said, with good light, you can't go wrong with this camera.  I mostly use the TV setting.  I set my shutter speed at about 250-360 and then I don't miss a single action shot.  It's fast, reliable, and fun.  This camera can get you results that look professional.The camera is bulky.  If you carry a large purse, you'll be fine with it, or if you use a backpack/briefcase.  But if you're expecting to slip this into your shirt pocket or jeans pocket, forgetabboutit.  It won't fit.  It will only fit in a very loose pants pocket, and even then it's annoying.  You could put it in a case and attach it to your belt, which works great, but ruins the style factor.  This camera looks like an old 1980s film camera (although it performs like a dynamite digital).  You won't win any style points with this camera.If you are going to have to lug something around and want the best quality you can afford, look at the Rebel XS, the best priced digital DSLR on the market.

West phal", "ReviewID": "R2CHMH65HZTI1Q", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I just received the SX110IS last week and have been playing around with it.  I researched this purchase extensively, so I'll share a few thoughts about that as well as my experience so far with the camera.  I'm a pseudo-serious amateur photographer who produces and shoots some video professionally.My criteria for selecting a camera was as follows:  -- I wanted a very portable camera with great image quality to upgrade my trusty A530 at a maximum price of $200.  (I think that spending any more than this on a point and shoot is a waste of money -- you'll never get the qualities of a quality dSLR, or a cheap film point and shoot, like shallow depth of field no matter how much you spend.)  -- I plan on upgrading my DSLR to a full-frame model with high definition video capability in the next year or so, so I wanted something now that was portable enough to carry in my shoulder bag or coat pocket (but not necessarily my shirt or pants pocket).  -- I valued advice from Consumer Reports, Steve's Digicams, and dpreview.com reviews (as well as savvy Amazon reviewers!).  -- I wanted at least some manual controls, optical image stabilization and at least a 4x zoom.  -- My bias was toward good low-light capability (although I understand the limitations of compacts) and AA-battery capability.  I really dislike proprietary batteries.  They tend to die a slow death, putting you in the frustrating position of deciding when you've had enough of their diminishing capacity and need to search for a replacement.  You have to buy and carry a spare at all times and purchase a third one after a year or so, which adds at least $60 to the cost of the camera plus hassle.  (New technologies in NiMh rechargeable batteries like Eneloop are versatile, economical, high performing and more environmentally friendly.)  -- The video size had to be at least 640x480 with a frame rate of at least 30fps.  I was hoping for high-definition video capability, but still-image quality was paramount.Just based on image quality and portability, I considered a handful of different models, like the Panasonic Lumix TZ5 (proprietary battery, so-so dynamic range, but great portability and high-def video), Canon A590 (can you believe they downgraded the 640x480 video to 20 fps?  A non-starter for me), Canon A2000 (max aperture of 3.2 is too small, plus no manual controls like aperture-priority mode) and Canon SD1100 (great size and interesting video features, but lack of manual controls), and the one listed here, the Canon SX110.  I had a hard time choosing, and finally went with the SX110.I've been using the SX110 for a couple of weeks now.  The image quality, when light is adequate, is nice, and the zoom is fantastic given the camera's size.  I've done some side-by-side shots with my A530, and the image detail and low-light capability of the SX110 is quite lovely.  (I have to say that it's downright depressing when compared to my cheapie Canon Rebel 35mm film camera with a 50mm lens on it--hence my comment about not spending very much on a digital point and shoot!)At the end of the day, the SX110 is a great package overall with respect to optics and functionality.  However, the build quality of this camera gives me cause for concern, despite the fact I'm VERY gentle with all my equipment.  Aside from the entire camera housing \"feeling\" very cheap (much less sturdy than my \"cheap\" old A530), which is something that I could get over, there are two major problems:1) The little \"video out\" door on the side of the camera, once opened, will not shut completely and stay closed.  It seems the latch to keep it closed isn't engineered right, or else it must have broken the first time I opened the door.  I thought it wasn't a big deal, but the fact that this little door is always ajar is a real pain (e.g., it catches on things because it just falls open when you tilt the camera on its side).2) The sliding door that contains the batteries and memory card is extremely hard to open.  It appears to have the same basic mechanism as my A530, but it is infinitely harder to operate.  I can do it, using two hands and inserting my fingernail to move the door over, but it really feels like I'm forcing it, and I can guarantee it will break after a dozen or so times.  And that door can't afford to be opening unexpectedly!I don't know if I got a lemon, or if this is what I should expect out of this camera, but it is definitely going back.  This weekend I'll stop in a local store who I know carries it and see if I encounter the same issues with their display model (I'll update this posting when I have more information).  For now, I feel like being generous so I'm giving the camera four stars.  It could go to five stars if I get a replacement model that has functioning doors, or to one star if that camera doesn't exist.  If that's the case, I'm going to take my money, replace my Olympus Stylus Epic film camera that got stolen, and go \"back\" to using film for my snapshots.  I'm almost frustrated enough to abandon any hope of a digital point and shoot that comes close to the same league as a film point and shoot.

In fact so great, it was hard to remember how difficult the picture actually was.  About the only example of that was when I was head-on to a bison, and wanted a profile shot.  I walked to the side about 50 yds, and when focussed again on the distant dot, realised that his head had turned, and he was still watching me.  Not a panic, since he was a long way away, but I then took the shot (zoomed in and out) to show how far away their awareness runs.  Still get the thrill of realising that the distant dot was watching me...I kept wanting to stand next to people with cumbersome (D)SLRs, and say \"Is this the photo you wanted?\", before slipping the camera back into my pocket.Away from the great outdoors, the flash combines well with the dynamic ISO seting, and allows good head shots across the dance floor at parties.Oh, and the usual thing from Canon CCDs that have minimal cascade even in low light conditions; near-black photos still have little sparkle in the image, just as it should be.And I have found good macro pictures, which I didn't expect.

Borntrager", "ReviewID": "RWNQSI61IG03V", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I honestly think that this is the best digital non-SLR out there right now. For its sub-SLR size, and its price, you simply can't beat it. The features on this thing are just endless. I find myself using 'Manual' mode almost all the time. Once you get to know your way around this thing, tuning the different parameters becomes second nature. I bought this camera to use on a 2 week trip to Uganda. I didn't have a chance to work with it much before I left, so I had to learn by doing, but the learning curve isn't that bad.I find it very easy to get exactly what I'm looking for in a shot. The manual focus is great, with the little focus box like a 35mm lens. I like the manual flip-up flash, too. It keeps it from firing when I don't want it too, and you don't have to try and remember what setting you had the flash on, you just have to look and see if it's up or down. I think that 9 megapixels is more than enough to work with, even when cropping. I have had a few problems with graininess above ISO 400. The continuous shooting mode isn't bad; I can 6 pics in 5 seconds if I'm using a fast shutter speed. I generally try and keep it in the 80-200 range and make up for it with shutter speed and focus range. The zoom is perfect. It's just enough to really get in close without getting too crazy. I don't see why you'd need the 20x zoom of the sx10. It just isn't necessary.As far as battery life goes, it uses 2 AAs, so...it's easy and fast to just carry extras and replace them, but the battery life suffers with more than I'd like, especially if you zoom in and out a lot, or review your pics quite a bit. I wish it did have an optical viewfinder, which would save a little on juice, but I'm not sure where you'd put it, since the flash is smack in the middle of the camera. A second loophole for a neckstrap might have been nice, too.Overall, though, I haven't seen another non-SLR camera out there that I like better.

I've never had a problem with an image being blurry because I was zoomed at the time. No camera is perfect, but this one really is top-notch.

This is the third in the Canon Powershot line of cameras I've owned over the years.  While on the other hand my old Nikon F4 SLR from the 80's is still holding its' own.  Perhaps a statement on the general lack of quality in electronics in these days of rapid fire progress and obsolescence.  But...  The changes that have been made over the past 3-4 years in Canon Powershot cameras is stunning.  This model SX110 IS, is a fabulous camera.  The viewing screen is very large, easy to see details, which lends itself to facilitate taking pictures.  The face recognition feature is also an improvement which makes taking good pictures easier than ever.  I've only been using this camera for over a month now, but have only praise for it.

We burned them to DVD and viewed on our big screen TV and the clarity of the videos held up great.  I found no audio issues - again, very sharp and clear.  Only once did wind noise get picked up.  The digital zoom for video was poor and I stopped using it right away.  When I wanted to zoom, I stopped recording, changed the zoom, and then went right back to recording.  Since I did our recordings in fairly short segments, this worked fine.I was most impressed by the low light capability.

The current model is a powerhouse.  9 MB file size, a 10x optical zoom giving you the same view as a 550 mm 35 mm camera lens lets you really pull images in from almost any vantage point.  The image stabilizer is also a great tool as there is no visible blurring due to hand shake.  The only issue for a really great camera is battery life.  The first set of batteries, the ones that came with the camera ran out fairly quickly, granted my 10 year son was shooting movies and then reviewing them over and over again, but still. This is the first digital camera that allows for the use of AA batteries off the shelf which in theory shouldbe convenient except that they really don't last very long compared to the rechargable batteries that usually come with these cameras. As a result a sprang for  rechargable batteries and a charger and then batteries seem to last a bit longer.

My biggest issue is that I cannot default the flash to \"on\" in average light situations.

The camera was well taken care of, kept in a case, wrist strap always used, never left out for little hands to grab. Went on vacation and was in the process of putting the camera back into it's case when it dropped to the floor (maybe a 2 foot drop). Immediately the flash stopped working, even when it was raised I got the 'raise flash' error. It still took pictures, but you had to have perfect artificial lighting for the camera not to need the flash to focus. I kept it throughout the summer and sent it off to the repair facility. For all purposes of this review, I will skip 99% of this story. Just make a mental note that if you crap from Canon breaks and it 'might not' be under warranty DON'T WASTE YOUR TIME WITH THE SERVICE CENTER. They are by far the worst customer service center I've ever had to deal with. After keeping my camera for a month, (and failing to email me status updates, as they had promised) I find out the camera is being shipped back to me because it's 'beyond economical repair'. For a camera that was as well taken care of as this one was, and dropped ONCE, 5 months old and cost a few hundred dollars. It should be a little more durable than that. I went from a 'buy nothing BUT canon' to a 'never buy Canon (or allow my family to buy) canon ever again.' It's pitiful that one customer service department cost this company hundreds or even thousands of dollars worth of business from screwing over my family alone. We will be upgrading to Nikon and participating in the extended and accidental warranties. Surprisingly all of the photographers I personally know recommend Nikon anyway. Now why didn't I just listen to them in the first place?^ EDIT ^I put a lot of work into picking out this camera. I wanted a better quality camera for a great price. The more professional cameras started at $400 it seemed, so I stuck with the bargains. I had the Powershot A630 with a flip out screen previously. My daughter found it on my desk and started to play with it, dropped it and the shutter broke and the auto focus seems to be off too. (For Christmas she got her own durable kid's camera, lesson learned!) So the first brand I started reading about was Canon Powershot. I saw an ad for this camera by chance while browsing another Powershot and immediately I loved it. It looked like a great balance between the SLR's and the pocket cameras. It's exactly what I wanted.Pros: Very large LCD screen, large viewing range, 9MP, Great auto focus and a great pop up flash. It's a 'meaty' camera. It makes me feel like it's durable-although I'm not going to let my 3 year old test that theory.It takes AA batteries. I guess that could be a pro or a con, depending on your preference. I prefer AA's because if I get in a bind I can just run into any store and pick up some cheap batteries to last a few hours.Cons: No eye hole (sorry, don't know the correct term for that thing!). It's a little slow recovering from a busy picture. If there is a lot going on in the background it takes a few seconds to write the picture and be ready for another one. It's also large for a pocket camera.

I took my selection down to 2 cameras - this one, the Canon Powershot SX110IS and the Sony Cybershot DSC-H-10 Digital Camera.  I really liked the Sony and probably would have purchased that one, except they advertise a 3\" screen, but the images shown on the screen only used 2\" of the screen.  There is a black border on top and on bottom, just like the wide screen movies on your TV.  Plus there is no lens cover.  One of my \"requirements\" was to have a 3\" screen, which I love.  The 10x zoom is great; pictures are clear and beautiful.

I've always had cams with less than 4x optical zoom before, so this one does show the stark difference. I have been able to click good photos of mountains that are anywhere between 10-30 miles from the point of clicking, while zooming on objects close by shows amazing details of the objects which I have not been able to capture with other lower optical zoom cams.- Focusing is good. With my previous cameras, I've had a 30% rate of good photos vs. bad ones. With this one I think the number must be above 75%.- Other shooting modes are excellent. For example, none of the photos I've taken in sepia mode are below average. Surprisingly though the camera lacks the color accent and color swap modes seen on other Powershots.- Battery life is average. But with spare rechargeable batteries (i.e. a total of 2+2=4), clicking up to 300 photos should be possible.- Flash is where the only problem I've found yet it. It feels very slow to recharge, and thus taking multiple pics in succession in a short time is difficult.I'm yet to explore more, and maybe I'll update this once I have done so.", "Date": "January 4, 2009"}, {"Title": "A bargin with alot of cool features.", "Author": "Pat", "ReviewID": "R3E4XU4R66TPB0", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This camera is a great deal but does have some pros and cons.The good stuff first a nice big LCD screen,strong flash for a point and shoot,alot of adjustments you find on higher end SLR models,great image stablization.The camera is vey sleek and compact and the 10x zoom is alot better than a 4x zoom on point and shoots that are around $200.The flip-up flash is both good and bad.You have to remeber to flip it up but if you are taking pictures somewhere you shouldn't use a flash all you have to do is leave it down on other cameras you have to find the flash off.Also on the selector wheel a couple of the most used modes (party,kids with pets,night snapshot,landscape and portait) all have their own notch.On the down side no veiwfinder (but this keeps the camera small) ,it is slow between pictures and some of the buttons are a little bit too sleek and you have to use the edge of your finger to push them best.Canon put alot of nice features into a small and inexpenise camera.The camera itself dosen't feel cheap and you would think it would cost much more.Unless you really want to get into photography and buy say a SLR with different lens and pay awhole more look no farther this it the best out there for the money.", "Date": "December 24, 2008"}, {"Title": "Canon powershot sx110is", "Author": "H.

Please read.", "Author": "lighten_up_already2 \"lighten_up_already2\"", "ReviewID": "R2AB442XTZGUEP", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Update -- 07/29/2009 --This is not a good camera for videos.  One reason is the inability to focus while zooming during a video.  The other reason is much more subtle. Some brilliant enginner put a \"compact\" video mode that one can easily switch to -- from hi res - just by turning the thumbwheel one quarter turn while in video shooting mode.  This is very easy to do by accident and without noticing.  The display resolution doesn't change much if you do this.  You only see it after you upload your videos to your computer and find they are all fuzzy until you reduce the video window to a little tiny box.  I ran off several videos and found later they were in ultra-low res and viewable only as a tiny box.Now my wife returns from taking our kids camping, and I find that all but one of the videos she shot were in low res because she accidentally in haste bonked the thumwheel -- which surrounds the \"set\" button that is frequently used.  The only indicator is a little envelope in the corner of the screen, which is not self explanatory and often not visible in the sun anyway when you're outside.  What a stupid design.-----------------------The camera meets a specific need in our family, and that is as a simple and rapidly deployable \"grab and go\" camera for recording cute stuff the kids do at school and on field trips.I already owned a Canon S3/IS camera (currently the S10/IS) which is well over $300 and vastly superior in several ways, but it has one major flaw and that is its thick profile.  It's a bulky camera.  You can't just stuff it into any pocket or purse or in a jacket.I figured that I was missing a good amount of recordable cuteness because my wife wouldn't grab the big fat S3/IS and take it with her, so I bought her this slim and not quite so capable camera with essentially the same menus and controls as its bigger brother.Now my wife grabs it and takes it places and I get more pictures and movies of the kids for our archives.  What a great age to be a parent.Here's what I particularly like.1.  The big screen on the back.2.  Face detection.3.  30 fps DVD resolution movie capability.4.  Just plain takes good pictures.5.  High Capacity SD chip compatibility.6.  Skinny even with the AA batteries.7.  AA batteries!  I really hate having to remember to charge proprietary little batteries. You have to have at least two so you can use one while the other is charging, and they eventually become useless and you have to replace them.  I love buying AA batteries in bulk, using them, and throwing them away.  Bwa ha ha ha ha!Now the stuff I don't like1.  It can't auto focus while zooming and shooting a movie.  I don't know that any camera at this price point does.  The big brother S10/IS probably excels at this because my S3/IS sure does.  I miss that capability in this camera.2.  Can't shoot around corners or hold the camera at weird angles because the LCD is in the back of the camera and does not flip out and swivel.  I can't hold this thing over my head and shoot down.3.  Chews up the batteries faster than the larger Canon, understandably, and takes longer to ready the flash than the larger Canon does.4.  And, a nitpick that really bugs me.  The SD card and the battery compartment are behind the same little door, which is on there really tight and it's a pain to have to open the battery compartment just to pop out the SD card, which I do way more often than swapping batteries because my PC has a card drive built in and transfers several GIG in a few seconds when I plug a card into it.So, if you want a LCD on a pivot, or you really want your digital camera to double as a camcorder, by all means spend the extra money to get the higher end camera.  If you want a \"grab and go\" camera that's a cut above many of the little tiny silver things that so many people seem to be in love with, try this one.", "Date": "February 13, 2009"}, {"Title": "Worked about a year and now it doesn't", "Author": "B.

I was not impressed with the blurry pics I was getting with the Sony. So i returned that item and got the Canon SX 110 IS. I did a lot of reading before getting this. I must say I got really good pictures with this camera. I took almost 600-700 pictures with this camera in different conditions. I took pictures on 2 completely different occasions, one was on a day on which we had a snow storm. So there was no sun and only snow, the other day being beautifully sunny. I got exceptional quality pics on both these occasions. I am still trying to explore the various options this camera provides especially the manual mode etc.My list of good and bad is as follows:G00D======1. Great Picture quality in most conditions.2. Very good in handling difficult light conditions.3. Exceptional 10X Optical zoom. I could get really close to distant objects.4. Beautiful black body. Very comfortable in your hand.5. Terrific maintenance of colors. Got exceptional color quality in bright sunlight.6. Great manual features. Helps photography enthusiasts like me to learn new ways of photography and techniques. Also has the auto modes for people who like to keep it simple.7. I like the SD card format for its simplicity. I ordered an additional 4GB transcend class 6 card which is amazingly fast.8. It runs on 2 NIMH rechargeable batteries. I got the Sony cycle energy 2000Mah to go with these and they also provide me exceptional long lasting power.9. The SD card also performs very good. very fast to copy and delete, reformat etc.NOT SO GOOD===========1. The Flash recharge time is very slow. This is one thing which I am not liking in this camera. It takes atleast 5-6 seconds to recharge the flash and during this time, you cannot take another shot. So you might miss out in catching a good shot on time.2. The AA cells this cam uses makes a bit heavy to hold. I am ok with it but others might want a lighter camera.3. Sometimes it looks like the camera takes some time and is a second late to take the picture after pressing the shutter button. So instead of capturing the intended action of the subject, it captures the next action which defeats the purpose of the shot.4. In low light conditions and photos taken inside the house, it shows some kind of white patches in the picture. I took a picture of my wall and it is showing some kind of white patches on the wall which is not seen normally. I dont know what extra the camera is able to see or should I be changing the settings. Yet to explore on that.5. It doesnt come with a neck strap. I would have liked if it came with a neck strap.6. The supplied image gateway software has been useless to me. It is of huge size and is a drap on my laptop. I didnt find any real useful or addtional features in this than what is there on other image editing software.All in all , I think this is a great camera for the $200 you spend. You will get beautiful snaps with this camera. At the same time, I think you should take this camera if you have real interst in learning photography and do a lot of reading becos thats how you can appreciate the lot of manual features this camera offers.

I've been very pleased.  I want to mention that after I dropped the old SX100IS model on concrete while it was on and the lens was extended out, the lens had actually jammed back in toward the body.  I thought it was a definite goner.  I jiggered it a bit and the lens unstuck, retracted back in as usual and then came back out when I turned the camera back on.  It seemed to realign itself after it went in and out a few times!  The only other problem was when I turned the camera on, the first shot could not be seen through the LCD view panel (there is no viewfinder) so I had to take the first shot blind and then everything would go back to normal after that.  The camera still seemed to take really good shots especially where there were contrasting colors.  I couldn't believe it.  It cemented my intention to buy the successor model when I replaced it.  It's also still small enough (with a protective case) to get into my medium-sized handbag for those occasions when I want a camera that's better than my cellphone.", "Date": "September 8, 2009"}, {"Title": "I love this!", "Author": "Lori Mickle \"mom of 4 boys\"", "ReviewID": "R1CDB8WH1UMXVN", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I had a Kodak Easy Share and wanted an upgrade to get closer shots.

In addition I do a lot of SLR digital photography and find myself in the middle of discussions about cameras a great deal. When people ask me about this little Canon I will definitely give it a thumbs up, albeit with one or two caveats.First of all, let me say that I am an insanely impatient person. When I get a brand new camera I want to use it RIGHT AWAY!  I don't want to have to spend any time mucking around with a manual.  I want a camera that is going to be user friendly enough for me to navigate within the first 5 minuets of owning it.  So on the scale for impatient people like me, this camera rates about a seven.  I could find my way around most of it but have had to pull out the dreaded manual once or twice to get to a menu that was well hidden, or to interpret a symbol that was unfamiliar.I like flexibility in a camera.  I want to have plenty of quick-to-get-at user settings, but  also want the freedom to adjust my settings as needed.  The camera gets a TEN on the flexibility scale.  It also gets big points for the 10x lens, and the way the flash works. I hate flashes that pop up automatically when you have all your settings on automatic.  There are plenty of times when you don't want a flash even though your subject is technically too dark.  This camera suggests (in big letters so you wont miss it) that you raise the flash, but doesn't insist.  If you do choose to use the flash it's as simple as manually flipping it up.  There are some other great features about this PowerShot as well.  The zoom is fast, the lag time is short, and the camera just plain feels good to hang on to.My only complaints so far are the batteries.  I prefer to have rechargeable, camera specific, batteries from the manufacturer.  I keep an extra set and have one charging while one is in use.  This PowerShot takes regular AA batteries.  In addition to being wasteful (the camera pulls a lot of power and sucks down batteries pretty quickly) this is no good for cold weather conditions.  I've gone and gotten some rechargeable AA's, but those seem to wear out even faster than the regular ones.For the price though, I think this camera is one of the best you'll ever own and I have no problem highly recommending it.", "Date": "February 6, 2009"}, {"Title": "This is a great camera", "Author": "Victor L.

I've been researching buying a new digital camera off and on for about 6 months and I can say my patience has been rewarded.  My two previous digital cameras were Sony's.  The main reason for a new digicam was image stabilization.  I've taken up kayaking and found many of my on water photos were coming out blurry, even in bright daylight.Likes:Macro is amazing with the SX110is.  You can rest the cameras lens on a page and it will autofocus on the lettering.  You can also manual focus in most modes.  Great for catching minute details.10x optical zoom!  40x digital zoom!  It gets you up close when distance between you and your subject is required.  Zoom up to 4x digitally while recording movie, although it does get grainy and you can hear the lever click on the recording.This flash is so much better than either of my Sony's.  The range is so much farther, and that's without any flash level adjustments.The cost!  A camera of this quality, with so many options at the $200 mark!  Outstanding!Dislikes:It would be nice if the flash would automatically pop up when needed like the Sony does.  Although I'll admit it made me jump while playing with one at Best Buy.Too many options (13!) on the Mode Dial .  My last Sony had 6 and the other options were software accessible.  I'm just afraid all that turning is going to wear out the dial faster.Also the control dial can be skittish while reviewing photos.  It's too easy to press (select) while spinning (scrolling).This is the second SX110is I purchased from Amazon.  I think the first one was a return because it was missing the documentation tray and the little tag that was hanging of my new one.  I returned it because the usb/av cover wouldn't stay closed.  No problem with the new one I'm happy to say.Overall it's a great camera.  My first Canon.  I can't wait to get back on the water with it.

This camera allows for Aperture Priority, Shutter Speed Priority, Custom ISO settings, Manual Focus, or complete manual control over all of these features.+Good build quality+Image Stabilizer (definitely helps when using the optical zoom)+Standard Mini-USB port+Backup battery for clock and settings (so you don't have to reset the clock when replacing the batteries or the SD Card which is located next to the batteries)+ SD/SDHC card slot+Face recognition (which is easy to quickly turn on or off with the press of one button)+Runs off two AAs. Both a good and a bad thing, although mostly good since you can change batteries when in the field or find extras at a local shop.+Direct-Print to printer with a USB cable (I've never used this, but could be useful and convenient for some)Cons:-Okay battery life. Battery can be used quickly  when using the flash a lot or using optical zoom often. Setting the LCD brightness down can help. I bought High-Capacity rechargeable AA batteries and these helped a lot. I wouldn't recommend cheap AAs though. It's worth investing money in good rechargeable batteries.-No optical viewfinder-Optical zoom can't be used with recording video (once started.) You can zoom in then start recording, but not while its going.-Grainy at high ISO speeds (although this is typical of P&S; cameras.) Anything up to 400 looks nice, but it's noticeable at 800 and 1600 and 3200 aren't usable at if you care about quality.-Not very compact and a little heavy. While this is fine for me (I like the form factor) this camera may not be for  someone who wants a thin light-weight camera.While I'm just an amateur photographer, this camera is definitely is worth its money for its impressive picture quality, optical zoom, and features. While the graininess at higher ISO settings is sometimes noticeable, this is common for point-and-shoot cameras. Some may ask why bother with this camera if you can get a 10+ or so Megapixel camera for about the same price or cheaper, it's simple... the SX110 IS takes great pictures, has 10x optical (which is very important in comparison to digital) zoom, and provides many features not found in most point-and-shoot cameras. Megapixels are not benchmark of the quality of the pictures, but rather the size (resolution.) If you want an advanced nice P&S; with extra features, but don't want to buy an SLR, then this might be the camera for you. If you plan on getting serious and want to take action shots that require higher ISO settings, consider an entry level SLR such as the Nikon D40. The D40 is around $450.", "Date": "January 5, 2009"}, {"Title": "great midlevel camera", "Author": "John R.

The menu is easy to use and I like being able to adjust as much or as little as I want.  I wasn't sure whether I'd like a pop-up flash, but it becomes pretty automatic to put it up and if you don't, the camera reminds you.  Lastly, I like being able to review my pictures without turning the camera on.  There is some lag time after a picture has been taken, but I am still using the memory card it came with while awaiting the arrival of my new one.  Once I have rechargeable batteries (I ordered Eneloop, which was recommended to me) and my Ultra II memory card, I expect to see some difference.  All in all, I am quite happy with this product.", "Date": "November 30, 2008"}, {"Title": "Another winner from Canon....", "Author": "Floyd Goodrich \"Jim G.\"", "ReviewID": "R3GF5UNZDRPFS", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This Canon SX110IS is as great as all the other reviewers say it is so I won't bore you by repeating all it's great features. I will only bring up a couple of minor things about this camera.Wish List....1. The SD card slot was not in the battery compartment.2. It would be nice to able to \"dedicate\" the print button (top left on back of camera) to video start and video stop like the Canon ELPH SD1000 is able to do. Turning the top control wheel to video is inconvenient when you want to start filming instantly.3. Although I don't dislike having AA batteries powering the camera, I would like a solid long lasting rechargeable battery like my SD1000 has. I am suspicious of this 400 shot capability with 2 AA's.4. One troublesome feature is how easy it is to change the quality of the video with the control wheel on the rear of the camera. A little movement of this wheel changes the video quality and you won't know it until its too late. Changing video quality should have been a drill down menu option instead of a control wheel function.The above are minor items and in no way take away the quality this camera has. This camera has nice to have features and not a bunch of silly never used features. I love the automatic lens cap, ability to review shots without turning on the whole camera. I love the solid feel and look of this camera, it's well built and small enough to carry around in your pocket or purse. The pictures it takes are Canon quality pictures and to me that means first rate just like my Canon Rebel XT.

We have tried all different brands of batteries with the same results.  We thought maybe we could use AA rechargeable batteries but the instructions state not to use this type of battery.  When they first start to die, it takes FOREVER for the camera to write the picture to the card, therefore you miss the next shot because you are waiting for the camera to reset.  It is not good in low light, therefore you need to use the flash more often, making the battery life even worse!  We took the camera to a 1 hour children's breakfast with a fresh set of batteries and by the end of breakfast had a low battery warning.  I decided to write this review, because after 1 year of owning this camera, I am back at amazon looking for another point and shoot.  I am embarrassed to see how much I paid for this! I could have bought a Canon G series for this price (the G series size is not all that much bigger)!  I own a Canon G2 and it is one of the best cameras I have ever owned.Things I liked:- Video mode takes nice videos for computer use (youtube, facebook etc.) I am not sure how they look on a regular TV.- Canon menus and settings are easy to understand.  I own or have owned at least 5 Canon cameras.- Had problems with other Canon cameras and the power switch being too easy to accidentally turn on the camera.  Not a problem with this one.Things I did not like:- Battery life is terrible.  I did not have this problem with the canons that use dedicated rechargeable batteries.- poor in low light.  Did not notice that IS made the low light pics any better.  Have to use flash almost always.- Slow to reset, especially as battery gets low- Slow to focus, especially as battery gets low- Plastic feels cheap and shows signs of cracking and wear after 1 year of use- Price.

This one did much better in that department; still not super fast, but if you want that you have to get an SLR.The really cool thing I wanted to mention is the impressive macro feature.  The saleswoman held it so that it was touching my engagement ring, and then so that it was touching a key ring, and it was able to focus on my ring band and on the key itself that close.  That to me is awesome!  I use to work at said camera store and played with all of the cameras' features.

Overall it is a great camera- it even has manual modes on the dial which is always nice if you know what you're doing with them =)I'd highly recommend it, but since I don't own it yet I only gave it 4 stars, incase I am missing a negative...", "Date": "October 18, 2008"}, {"Title": "Excellent camera for the money", "Author": "L.

I was looking for an easy point and shoot with a good zoom. The camera is a little bigger than I expected and already presented a problem when I was out with my friends and family. I kept putting the camera away instead holding on to it.  The time in between pics for the flash to recharge is unacceptable! After reading so many reviews it seems the cameras with AA batteries tend to have a delay in between pics, why I don't know.  That alone has steered me away from this camera. I'm a mom of 2 active boys and I wanted a camera that's easy to take along, take quick pics and easy to learn. The camera however, does take amazing pics and great video.  However, a ton of my pics came out blurry, especially if I didn't remember to lift up the flash which I never did.  There is just too much too learn with this camera and just too many features and setting. A little too overwhelming for me. Curious as to why the flash recharge is so long? Does anyone know? So I'm returning this camera and getting my SD750 fixed for the $100 Canon is going to charge me or I'm getting the A590is, not sure.

I was incredibly disappointed that after 2 years, the lens jammed. Called an error 18. Upon doing research I learned it is a common problem with the Canon lens. Customer service was less than acceptable. I still wanted a zoom lens and shopped around for price point, size, optical zoom. I was a little gun shy with Canon and compared the camera to its competitor which I believe is the Lumix. I ended up getting Canon's new version of the 10x zoom. It increased the mp to 9 which is good. This camera is much smaller which is great. The pictures are good and so far I don't have any complaints. I am still learning about the camera and have not yet played with all the features. My concern is the shelf life with regard to this lens as I do use the camera frequently. If this lens tanks on me I will no longer be a Canon Camera owner. So, at this point I would recommend the camera with re: to size, picture quality, optical zoom options and image stabilization.

I was a little unsure of use of AA batteries instead of a lithium ion battery.  And that was the ultimate downfall of this camera.  I went through the two AA batteries each day of use.  This can get quite pricey.  I loved the zoom and the large screen, but I did find a few dead pixels on the left part of the screen.  I could have lived with the dead pixels, but again the battery life was deal breaker.

I bought this camera to tote around in my purse when the other camera is too big.  Many problems with this camera.  First, it doesn't work with my Card Reader.  I've NEVER had a problem with any camera I've used with it, but this camera \"writes\" the picture to the card differently, so it doesn't work.  You have to use their software.  The pictures are an odd size ( about a 6x8)  so when you go to have them printed as a 4x6, the bottom is cut off along with the date stamp.  The flash doesn't pop-up by itself... it's a manual process.  This is not  always a bad thing if you don't want the flash, but you may miss a few pictures when you forget to pop it up.The f/stop is usually 2.8 for many settings whether it is for the \"mountain setting\" or the \"portrait setting\".  If you don't know what this means, don't worry.  In a nut shell, the focus area is too small and if someone is standing slightly behind someone else... they will be out of focus.  Very crappy setting for snapshots.  The shutter speed is usually too slow for indoors... translating to blurry pictures if someone is moving (when flash is not on).  If the flash is on, it will \"freeze\" the motion but will be really bright.The self timer doesn't work.There's more, but I have to say, I'm really disappointed in this camera.", "Date": "January 11, 2010"}, {"Title": "Canon review", "Author": "WarwoodJudy", "ReviewID": "R1N6OYQFQD06C7", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I purchased a CanonPowershotSX110IS for my daughter for Christmas.

This was way too long to wait so I proceeded to cancel the order.  Lo and Behold, the camera was now in stock at a price of 199.00!!!  I went ahead and ordered the second camera and cnaceled the first one, but I feel that I was caught.  I believe that Amazon knew that all the customers who wanted the camera for Christmas would pay the extra 50.00 just to get it. The camera is just what she wanted, but I wonder how the company could go from having the camera at 149.99 (delivery in late Feb. or early March) and then in the space of several days suddenly have the camera at 199.99---immediate delivery.
