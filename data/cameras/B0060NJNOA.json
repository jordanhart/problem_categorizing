First you have to be careful because to use this item you also need to buy an internal hard-drive. That point to me isn't really communicate all that clearly. Anyway once I got the unit set up and my cameras set-up I ran the included software from the included disk. I kept getting to a certain point and the indication was that my cameras, though recognized, would not connect to the DVR. I made the dreaded call to the support line and after the usual waiting a tech took over my computer and made the proper selections to get the cameras to connect and record on the DVR. I should note that my cameras are D-Link cameras. Without the tech \"showing\" me how the connection cycle works there is no way I would have figured it out. The instructions and software did not show these techniques. So plan to spend some time with a tech if you buy this unit. Also somewhat annoying is the fact that from time to time the DVR decides to go off line, so you have to restart and reconnect the cameras. So pay attention when the tech is showing you the sequence because you will need it again.", "Date": "November 19, 2013"}, {"Title": "Works like a charm!", "Author": "Smedz", "ReviewID": "R1FMW2MVBSLNE3", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I bought this item the first week of Dec 2012. It was easy to set up and it currently supports 4 IP cameras and I'm getting ready to add two more. I have had no trouble with it and I can access it remotely just as advertised. I would highly recommend the DNR-322L for home or small business network camera security sytem.", "Date": "December 26, 2012"}, {"Title": "Terrible.

It can connect to them and I can get a live view, but cannot record.  I've restored the device to defaults and started over, following the install guides from the beginning, line by line. Still nothing. I can get it on the network, it will connect to the cameras. I can set up the recording schedules.  But this network recorder refuses to record.  So, its pretty much useless.
