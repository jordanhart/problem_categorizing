{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Hit Or Miss Quality & Functionality", "Author": "Perfectly Funny Wanderer", "ReviewID": "R2E7WDMOIAQAW0", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "The camera just came out but doesn't live up to the hype and reviews I had read.  This is based on about 2 weeks of use, indoor and outdoor, including an indoor speaker event, a large outdoor rally on the mall in Washington DC, a party, a hike in a park during autumn, and various other activities.  The camera is physically well-designed and manufactured with quality materials & construction.Biggest Issue: picture quality is hit-or-miss, mostly miss.  Quality for both color and sharpness was occasionally excellent, and typically like a cell-phone camera.  There are over a dozen interesting settings, such as sports and landscape modes, and they didn't help enough to solve the picture quality & consistency issue.Other Cons:most of the controls are on-screen, and these are not always fast to operate (such as zoom in & out, and changing photo settings)menu system is not as helpful or intuitive as it could be, so sometimes it was easier to turn off and on instead of navigating.the camera has internal memory that always came up first when reviewing photos... had to click through several menu options to view today's photos by date just to see the most recent photo taken.  And everyone wants to see how they look in the photo you just took, so it wasted a lot of time.video is HD but grainy at timesauto-focus seemed slow to kick in at times (this may be setting-dependent)time stamp on video files was different by several hours and minutes from the time stamp for photos (on Win 7 PC).Pros:Pinch-and-zoom touchscreen works nicelythe optical zoom is all inside the camera, and will stay clean... and worked well.when it took nice photos, the 10+ megapixels were nice to have for printing, cropping, etc.small and slimhas some internal memoryboots up fast enoughOverall the camera works okay for taking photos & video, but appears to almost be defective in execution.  Given the price (upper 200's) it is not going to be kept (even if I have to eat the cost of returning it plus Amazon's fee of apparently 15% for opened items.)  Researching the other new Nikon - Nikon Coolpix P7000 10.1 MP Digital Camera with 7.1x Wide Zoom-Nikkor ED Lens and 3-Inch LCD.Original Review Nov 10, 2010.Update Nov 24, 2010: I bought the Nikon Coolpix P7000 and it has the superb quality & features that I hoped would have been better delivered in the S80.  I've sent the S80 back to Amazon.Also, since this camera comes in many colors, check the reviews of other colors (Nikon Coolpix S80 14.1 MP Digital Camera with 3.5-Inch OLED Touch Screen and 5x Wide Zoom-Nikkor ED Lens (Red) (many reviews) , Nikon Coolpix S80 14.1 MP Digital Camera with 3.5-Inch OLED Touch Screen and 5x Wide Zoom-Nikkor ED Lens (Black) ).

This camera was more than I wanted to spend but it was worth it! It is not going to be one of those camera's that take great pictures in fast motion, but it does take pictures when someone is moving which is more than I can say for other small cameras.  The other feature that I really liked was it did not take FOREVER to take a picure in the dark and for me to view it.  If you want an awesome camera, well you will have to buy the larger more expenive ones, but for an easy to carry and understand, good camera, this one I liked.", "Date": "November 6, 2010"}, {"Title": "Slick, Sleek and Portability", "Author": "Trapshooter \"UncleGuido\"", "ReviewID": "RMOVK956NTQWY", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I purchased the Nikon S80  two-and-a-half months ago, and I have shot about a thousand shots with it.  I bought it because I wanted a camera that performed decently, and had a slim body so that it could be easily carried in a jacket or suit pocket.  I give it four stars because it provides what I expected from a small, sleek camera, and fits a niche in my camera stable which was missing.  I have had a few bad shots, but frankly most of these bloopers were due to my own fault in not practicing enough with the camera and exploring its capabilities.I am shortly leaving on a trip, and wanted to carry a point-and-shoot with me for quick shots when I was not carrying my larger Canon EOS Rebel T1i 15.1 MP CMOS Digital SLR Camera with 3-Inch LCD (Body Only).  I put it to a head-to-head comparison with my Canon Powershot SD990IS 14.7MP Digital Camera with 3.7x Optical Image Stabilized Zoom (Silver) \"point-and-shoot\", and found that the images on the Canon were perceptibly sharper, shooting a blank stucco wall on my house, with overcast lighting.  A tripod was used for all shots.  I shot at various ISO's, and the results on the  Canon were consistently better quality.  To be fair, the Nikon has a fixed lens, and the Canon has a more sophisticated system.  But, of course, the Canon was more bulky.Here are the pros:1.  The camera has such a slim body that it can be easily be carried in a suit or shirt pocket without any bulk.  It is a pretty little camera.2.  The touch screen is large, and gives a good view of the subject to be photographed.3.  The touch screen controls are easy to get used to, and the lack of ability to fine tune the shutter speed and aperture make shooting pretty simple.4.  The software which accompanies the camera is very good and user friendly.5.  The ability to shoot by touching the screen is a nice feature.6.  The camera will charge when connected to the computer through the USB cable which is provided.  If you are traveling with a laptop computer, you don't have to worry about carrying around bulky chargers and cords.  The USB cable connection both charges and acts to transfer the photos from the camera to your computer.7.  The ability to record a memo with the shots is a nice feature.8.  Movies are of decent quality.9.  There is a 2-second timer (as well as a 10-second), which is nice for shots taken with a tripod where you just want to avoid camera shake which comes with depressing the shutter release.And the Cons:1.  The quality of the photos is good, but the small fixed lens does not have the ability to deliver the sharpness you will get with a more complex lens system.2.  The touch screen is both a pro and a con.  Sometimes you will trigger the shutter release inadvertently.  But this is a minor problem, since the photos are digital and you can erase them at no cost.  The touch screen electronics are not instantaneous, and sometimes there is a slight delay between the touch and the camera's response.3.  The lightness and lack of bulk is, again, both a pro and a con.  The lack of bulk contributes to a fair amount of camera shake.  The vibration reduction system helps with this, but in the movie mode you really need something like a tripod or monopod to steady the camera.4. Without an eyepiece, you are at the mercy of the sunshine reflecting off the back of the touch screen.  It is difficult to use in sunny conditions.If you are looking for the ability to fine-tune your shots by working with the AV and TV settings, and require a lot of flexibility in how you set up your \"point-and-shoot\", this camera would probably not meet your needs.  But if you are looking for a camera which scores high on portability, simplicity, good looks, and decent functioning on both still shots and movies, this camera may be for you.", "Date": "April 5, 2011"}, {"Title": "Returned the Camera", "Author": "Nat", "ReviewID": "R1434H5QC0ZJ11", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "Touch screen was a nightmare (finicky and unresponsive).

I read some negative reviews about this camera and I was very concerned about the product I bought, but when I started using it, it simply turn out to be a very impressive camera.There may be some features that a professional user may find out to be lacking improvement, but a common user would be glad to have what he paid for.My needs of this camera was a point-and-shoot with a clear wide screen, compact, a lot of mega pixels, high definition videos and simple to use. Every need I have was more than satisfied with this product.Screen: has a very good resolution and the touching features is completeley responsive in every way.Compact: the camera is as thin as it gets and built in a hard case, so it look pretty resistant.A lot of mega pixels: well, 14 mega pixels are more than enough.High Definition: videos look very good in TV.Simple to use: this is a quite interesting feature. The icon based screen is very friendly and do not interfere with the image of the picture you are taking.Plus: the touch screen have some features than turn out to be helpfull during a photo shooting, like registering the target to be shot with a simple touch, and watch the camera follow the target with the focus.The touch screen is also multi touch, so zooming in and out in a taken picture, is pretty cool, plus other touch screen gestures.The album feature and the rating feature for your pictures makes it very fun to organize your tons of images.Summerizing, I think it is worth the price.If you want an tablet to work as a computer, you would be dissapointed. Same with this camera. If you want it to work as a professional camera, you would be dissapointed.

The battery will drain when video recording so I would recommend getting extra batteries.Pros: It's very easy to use.

I sent it back to Nikon's west coast repair center, where the optics were cleaned.  That fixed the dark area.It tends to freeze up when playing back its own video. When it freezes, not only does the touch screen do nothing, but it won't power off. The battery has to be removed to reset it.  This happened twice today. I've seen this reported in other reviews, so I suspect a software bug.  Is there a firmware upgrade available?Taking video, and downloading from the camera, seem to work fine.  Video works well in bright light, but becomes grainy in moderate indoor lighting.As for the design, it's hard to hold and use.  Since the whole back is a touch screen, you have to hold it withouttouching the back.  The lens is at the upper left front, so you can't hold it there or block the lens.  The shutter release is at the top right, so you can't hold it there.  It has to be held carefully, by the corners.The touch screen is frustrating. About half the time, touching something doesn't have any effect.  Others have reported this problem.I expected better from Nikon.  They used to have a great reputation.  No longer.

Before I bought it I read all the reviews and there was a lot of people who weren't to happy about it. I had played with it for a few hours at Best Buy just to have them tell me that they didn't have it in stock. (Thank you Amazon) And they only had 2 colors...Some people were complaining that the picture were coming out all blurry...and for awhile mine did that too, till I realized that if you barely hold the button it focuses, and then you press and it takes the picture crystal clear, problem solved. This camera is just so awesome, I've been playing with the settings on my own, but do intend to read the user's manual for it. It's not a professional camera, more of a point and shoot, and you can't really take pictures while moving, but that's ok since most of the pictures I like to take I like to stand still for. It even comes with a program to help you upload your pictures.I did have a problem at first with the slider on the camera it would randomly open in my pocket, but I ended up just using a case for that, since I don't like the thought of bumping into something and breaking my camera. The battery is not even that bad...it doesn't have a battery meter on the actual camera itself, but once you plug it into the computer, the main screen shows the battery gauge. And it lasts for quite awhile, I had mine charge for 3 hours+ before taking it out a test drive.The touch screen is fun too, I feel like I'm using my phone, except with a better camera on it. When flipping through the pictures, it may lag, but I found out if you start from the top right corner they flip through much faster. There is even a picture editor on the camera, which is fun to play with, it's like a miniature photoshop.

Ok, don't get me wrong: it's a Nikon and takes great pictures. And it's compact, sleek and sexy with a cool rubberized slide to uncover the protected lens and turn it on. Good zoom too.But... the touchscreen is hard to use and a little unresponsive. Way too hard to change any settings. Would have been nice to not have the zoom control on the touchscreen. And a touch slow on it's time from turning it on to taking your first shot. And the camera lacks some of the in-camera editing options of other Nikons.And this is incredibly annoying: when you review your images, if you delete one, it returns to last image taken. Argh! Forget editing or going thru pictures on the camera.Nikon usually makes great cameras. I can reccomend a bunch of other Nikons and other compact touchscreen cameras to choose instead of this one. If you want a great, pocket sized camera with the small lens and sliding cover, I heartily reccomend the Fuji z10, z20 and z100s.

The flash is unpredictable. Even when I have selected a flash picture, it will work, then with the next shot, won't work (two shots in sequence). Or, one picture will come out great with the flash, the immediate next one is washed out. The on camera menu - though a great idea - is slow, unresponsive, just plain clunky. Deleting pictures is a nightmare. You delete one, then you are taken to the end of the picture stream, only to have to scroll slowly back to where you where. I would have expected Nikon to come out with some type of software update for this camera to resolve some of these issues, but nothing.
