{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Simple Door Lock Install", "Author": "smiley", "ReviewID": "R2JS9NNB7QH6I7", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This significantly simplified the keyless entry install. Plugs directly into my viper 5701 and using 1 resistor I was able to wire it up to a mazda 3. This allows the viper 5701 to unlock all doors as if it was pressing the unlock on the doors lock/unlock button. I highly recommend this over the two relay install because it comes with all the wires preattached, resistor pack, and in a smaller footprint.If you're looking for driver door priority unlock, then you need a different solution than this. This device is only for unlocking all doors or locking all doors.", "Date": "October 9, 2010"}, {"Title": "make my day easier", "Author": "M.Xiong", "ReviewID": "R3MNB7VJVOF0MW", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "nice product easy to install and use for all door lock actuator... is a must have no more relay lying underneath the dash... great product as stated...

Rainwater", "ReviewID": "R11JN9QTNELYLL", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I like the fact that I was able to intigrate it with relative ease into the Viper system I installed into my 2010 Ford Ranger. The polarity is reversed on the ford door lock system so you will have to hook them up in reverse order. Splice, check then solder. I was able to make all my connections at the fuse panel. Butt connectors are o.k. but you cant beat solder or a good connection.", "Date": "July 19, 2013"}, {"Title": "Compact and Works", "Author": "josh \"jtd\"", "ReviewID": "RF2HONK8GTZQN", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Basically a two relay lock setup in a small box, works just like two independent relays but is far more compact and has a nice clean professional look. used a few of these and haven't had one fail yet, my go-to lock setup.", "Date": "June 6, 2013"}, {"Title": "Great mod", "Author": "Bryan", "ReviewID": "R2YT7HN4SM0DO6", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I originally wanted to setup a double relay but found this.
