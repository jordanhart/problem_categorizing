Knell", "ReviewID": "R3V66G8UCJH7R3", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "What can I say?  I love the 5400!  It is my second from the Coolpix series.  My first was a CP 880 that took a fall so the 5400 was a replacement.  It's well worth the money.  I looked around a lot and couldn't find anything I liked from other manufacturers that packed the features and flexibility of the 5400.If you are a new digital user, the auto mode and scene modes are great.  I usually shoot in P or M modes and can turn the dial to Automatic mode and hand it to my wife who likes the ability to point and shoot without thinking about adjusting anything.  You can grow into this camera if you don't know yet how to shoot manually.The 15 different scene modes to choose from are excellent. The panoramic assist mode is particularly cool.  You can shoot a panoramic horizontally, vertically or in a 360 degree circle.  You take photos and then put them together after download with the ArcSoft software that comes with the camera.  It even allows you to fine-tune the pictures in case they do not align they way you want them too.Pros:Turn a fully automatic camera into a fully manual camera with the turn of a dial.  I haven't found anything this camera cannot do that my recently auctioned SLR could do.  Picture quality is equal to me.The camera feels great to hold.  All of the buttons are in convenient locations.  Menus can be customized to show what you adjust frequently and you can store two different user settings using the function button.5-shot buffer is great.  It will take photos as long as you hold down the shutter release.  It only stores the last five frames even if you have held the shutter release down long enough to make 20 exposures.  Also does time lapse.Shutter speed from Bulb to 1/4000.Crisp Macro shooting.The Vari-Angle display is much better than a fixed position display.Three metering options- Matrix, Center-weighted and Spot are very effective.Takes Type I and II compact flash.  I wouldn't go with anything less than 256mb.  Make sure it is USB compatible memory if you plan to use a Compact Flash reader in a USB port.Hot shoe for accessories is a great addition.  When a speedlight is attached, you can set the camera to fire the internal flash and speedlight or you can turn off the internal flash and use only the speedlight.  This is great if you want to bounce your speedlight and use the internal for a fill-flash.  It also works with a SC-17 remote cable if you want to get the flash off the camera for close up/macro shots. (If you are thinking about getting a Nikon speedlight, go with the SB-80DX or find an old SB-28 or SB-28DX versus going with the SB-50DX.  It's worth the extra money if you are going to do any manual shooting/adjusting of speedlight.  There is no manual mode on the SB-50DX so you can't really fine tune lighting if you are shooting with the camera in manual mode.)Battery life is good (about 1.5 - 2 hrs.) It comes with a charger and 1 battery.  A second (or 2CR5) as a back-up in my case has come in handy.Cons:The autofocus is not very good in low light situations.  I have a Nikon SB-28 speedlight with autofocus assist but the 5400 doesn't activate it. I knocked off half a star for that.You have to go through a 1/4 view screen before going to full-screen view when using the Quick Review.  I think it would be better if it went straight to the full-screen view and did away with the 1/4 screen view. (-1/4 star.)The only option for adding filters is the HN-CP10 hood with 77mm filters.  It's great to have a hood large enough to stay out of wide angle compositions but the 77mm filters are very expensive. (last 1/4 star)Card cover is flimsy.  I have a card reader and each time I open the door to remove the card, I think about how flimsy it is. The 880 had a much more sturdy door.Area through the viewfinder is significantly different than what you see in the monitor.  I read somewhere it is about 35% less through the viewfinder than the monitor.Overall, it's a great camera for the beginner or advanced user.  As a result of purchasing this camera, I shoot only digital and don't miss my SLR one bit.  The owner's manual is 160 pages and thoroughly explains all the camera's features.  I've had it for 3 months now and am still learning what this camera can do.", "Date": "November 7, 2003"}, {"Title": "A digital beginner's impression:  Very good, but not perfect", "Author": "golden comet", "ReviewID": "R27PE59GK3CLN8", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Although I have had years of experience with conventional cameras in both 35mm and medium format, the Nikon Coolpix 5400 is the first digital camera I have owned. I had grown weary of traveling with a 35mm and several lenses, or even more bulky medium format cameras.Other reviewers have amply written about the features of this camera.  I am going to focus on performance.The Coolpix 5400 has good optics.  I have shot the equivalent of several rolls of film on it.  The photos have been crisp, had faithful color rendition without any glaring digital artifacts, and really don't need any software manipulation.  So far, so good.All is not roses, however.  The Coolpix 5400 is very, very, very slow in writing from the a/d converter to the flashcard.  Fire off a bunch of shots in continuous mode and get ready to wait.  And wait some more.  Smokers will have time for a cigarette or two; others could take a short bus ride or file their nails.  It's that bad.  I find this to be inexcusable in a camera sold at the original price point of the 5400.  In fact, a lot of less expensive cameras are quicker.  Canons don't seem to do this as poorly as the Nikon 5400 and Sony with its new V3 may be the fastest prosumer camera on the block for the time being.  I think most other name brands will be quicker also.  I should point out everything is relative: all point and shoot and prosumer digital cameras will be much slower than a digital SLR.Another shortcoming:  the autofocus in dim light problem that has been amply documented by other reviewers.  This has not bothered me that much, but it is a problem to be aware of (this problem is not unique to Nikon).A former shortcoming, the lack of a RAW file format has been rectified.  You can now download firmware enabling RAW files from the Nikon USA website.  It is up to you whether you want to utilize the RAW format.  RAW is essentially uncompressed, but I doubt you'd be able to discern any real differences between a RAW or JPEG photo at normal print size.Were it not for the glitches I listed above, I'd highly recommend the camera to just about anyone.  As it is, the Coolpix 5400 is suitable for someone like a landscape photographer who takes a long time to compose a picture and has some patience; but it's not for the person who wants to take action shots and  review them quickly.The Coolpix 5400 has been recently discontinued by Nikon, and, depending where you shop. the price has dropped from a bit to enormously. That may make its few flaws more acceptable to the new buyer.  My advice: shop around and try to use the camera you are interested in buying as much as possible.  Online reviews can provide a good guide, but you really need to put your hands on a camera and run through the controls to see if it is right for you. What feels good in my hand may not in yours.Hope this has been of some help.", "Date": "November 27, 2004"}, {"Title": "Excellent Camera!", "Author": "R.

Although this camera does have point and shoot capabilities, the camera is clearly designed to be tweaked and played with to get a professional image.  This camera is the grade in between a consumer and professional camera and you'll immediately see and feel that when you begin to use the camera.As for what remarks I've seen regarding fuzziness, blurriness or quality of images... the 5400 produces crystal clear, professional images once you've taken the time to learn how to use the camera and produce the images.  If you're not willing to sit down and learn how to use the camera, you're wasting your money.  Of course, if you're a previous Nikon Coolpix user it will be a relatively easy learning curve.Frankly, who cares where the camera was made?  Every element on the 5400 works and functions great.  Nothing on the 5400 has been overlooked or \"skimped\" over.  This camera's been on the top 10 at PC World for months since its release and for good reason.My favorite feature compare to the 5000 is that I'm not always removing the lens cap to do simple tasks such as downloading images into my computer.  The menu is also a lot better and it's a lot easier to navigate between the different shooting modes.The features have already been thoroughly reviewed by other users, but overall this camera is an excellent camera with more features and absolute control then you could imagine.

Very good all around performance, a few small problems (no Focus Assist light and fairly small LCD are some) but overall a solid camera with a lot of features and unbeatable at the price.For those who are having problems focusing in low light I have to ask, are you shooting on a tripod or by hand?  Take advantage of the nice feature whereby this camera shows you the exposure time right on the LCD when taking pictures, at medium and low light levels the camera will often have an exposure time of 1 second or more, this will lead to a blurry shot if it's not heald perfectly steady.If you are having blurry shots at low light, try the same shot on a tripod or just sitting on something solid, I bet the shot will be crystal clear and very bright (I took some late twilight shots tonight and they look almost like midday with the right settings!).Many features seems advanced for a camera of this price range, and sometimes at the cost of point and shoot ability, but if you are looking for a good prosumer level camera I have to say this feels like a solid bet.", "Date": "January 18, 2005"}, {"Title": "Nikon's Coolpix 5400 is full of Great Features", "Author": "Peter M.

This made-in-Japan wonder, has not let me down.  Have been using the 5400 about 10 days now.  I took camera and manual up to a lean-to in the Adirondacks for an overnight, and had a great time trying the various features.  I took pictures in the deep forest in a misty rain, using a Leki Photo walking stick as a monopod and got great results.  I set the white balance for \"cloudy\" and colors were rendered accurately.  Subsequently, on a clear day in the shade, with white balance set to \"shade\", greens were nice and warm - not blue as with slide film (unless you put on a filter.)  You can even bring along a piece of white paper, aim the camera at it, and set the white balance precisely for any lighting situation.  I have methodically plodded through the manual, and pleasant surprises abound.  The camera is a joy to use, controls are well deployed.  And with battery, it only weighs 13 oz - a backpacker's dream camera, with 28 - 116 zoom.  This is possibly the only 5 MP camera on the market with a 28mm equivalent wide angle lens integral to the camera.  In macro, it will focus as close as 1/2 inch!  If you are into scenics and nature, this is the camera to own.

It weighs 0.8 lbs with the battery.  As I am 200 lb size man, this camera definitely is compact for me.The camera is powerful.  It has a wide angle lens, standard. The optical zoom is 4x. Shutter speeds range from 10 mins (bulb) to 1/8000 sec (ultra high speed); but, 97% of my shooting uses 1/8 sec to 1/700 sec shutter speeds. f/ values range from 2.8 to 8.0 (8.0 reached at 4x zoom). In 1600x1200 jpg fine picture mode, it can snap 7 frames in 2.7 sec (high speed continuous), or 54  frames in 33.5 sec (low speed continuous). For faster continuous shooting, I recommend using the QuickTime movie mode (includes sound), rather than the ultra high speed continuous mode. The movie mode is 15 fps, 3 mins max at 320x240 pixels or 70 secs max at 640x480 pixels. You can combine and edit the movie clips, using QuickTime Pro software ($30 extra).The camera can be used in fully auto mode, or for the best pictures, you will want to go to the fully manual mode ( this will be a learning experience for the novice).  Also, available, if you need extra high quality pictures (better than jpg), you can use the TIFF 2,592x1,944 pixel mode (5 mega-pixels is also available for the jpg images).The color accuracy of this camera is very high. While photo editing the pictures, I seldom need more than one click of adjustment to achieve perfect color, and half the time , zero adjustment is needed.Auto focus will be 97-100% accurate in average or bright light, but if the light is very dim, then the auto focus quits working. Also, the natural focus of the lens tends to be soft, so that a setting of high image sharpening, + contrast, and +1 color saturation is recommended. The lens has rather low chromatic and linear aberration.The auto ISO sensitivity and the auto white balance of the camera is generally very good , so no manual adjustment is needed or recommended.  Image \"noise\" is almost zero at ISO's of 50 to 150.The monitor measures 1 1/4\" x 7/8\" , 1.5\" diagonally. It is easy to see the image in bright sunlight, and has good resolution at 134,000 pixels. The monitor is big enough for me - I am nearsighted, but a lot of people would prefer the 1.8\" size monitor.I can't give this camera a 5 star rating, because, then you would have to give the professional league cameras a 6 star rating.

I am a fine artist and need to archive my work. In the past, that meant shooting everything in 35mm and then my better pieces needed to be shot again in 4x5 format as well in the event I wanted to reproduce them at a later date as large prints. I had to bracket each shot at least three ways to make sure I got the best shot. And at the end of a photo shoot, it could get pretty expensive with all the film and processing. Along with the 5400, I also purchased a 512mb flash card and a AC adapter so I wouldn't have to continually upload my images. In one session, I was able to shoot over 40 works, and only two needed to be reshot because they were soft. I shoot in bright natural light and the auto focus worked very well. I shot everything at the highest resolution setting as tif files which are pretty big. I was able to store about 35 images on the flashcard before it ran out of memory. The colors were so accurate, I hardly needed to tweak them at all in Photoshop. Needless to say, the camera paid for itself in one photo shoot and the ease and time saving qualities are priceless to me. I would highly recommend this camera, but get yourself a flash card with more memory if you want to store more images than using the card it comes with. (I think an 8). Also, I would suggest steering clear of sellers who are offering this and other similar items at a ridiculous savings. They will try to upsell you with incredibly high cost extras like extended waranty and cases and cards and lenses. If you don't agree to buy any, they will likely screw up your order, lie to you and make your life a living hell.

Moore", "ReviewID": "R2LW6G6EN4EF0W", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "In response to the made in Korea question, I received my camera a week ago and was terrified to see that it was made in Korea (having read the reviewer's comment).  After a week of unneeded stress, I can personally say that there is absolutely nothing wrong with my camera - it works perfectly.  I'm sure the reviewer had a problem with his camera and simpy assumed it was the fact that it was made in Korea.  More realistically, he simply received a lemon camera - it happens.  (Incidently, the \"Made in Korea\" is located on one side of the box in tiny print, or on the bottom of the camera.)  So far this camera has been amazing.  Super wideangle that no comparable competitor can surpass, and great macro capabilities.  I went for this one over the 5700 for that fact (and the price difference - plus having to deal with rebates).  I haven't yet had any reason to worry about the buffer speed as some reviews have nailed it on.  How many times do I need to take 30 continous low res shots in a row (as in, holding down the shutter release) and then turn around and take more shots?  Really, the only major drawbacks to this camera in my opinion, are the optical viewer and the price.  The viewer doesn't cover the entire actual shot taken which can cause you to get a shot you hadn't intended.  So I basically rely on the LCD screen usually.  But isn't that what most people do anyway?  The price is high basically because its a Nikon and built out of good materials.

I loved my 990 from the first day I took it out of the box. The 5400 has taken a little \"bonding\" time and I'm still a little ambivalent about it. Some of the things I like best about it are also the things that annoy me the most.The 5400 produces images of superior quality to the 990, not just in pixel count, but in dynamic range. It also produces sharper images over a wider range of the zoom, with less distortion and color fringing problems. The color balance is better, too, especially in the rendering of skin tones.Most of my photography falls into two categories: Tabletop catalog-style shooting with external flash, and travel pictures using natural lighting, both outdoors and indoors. The Nikon 5400 fulfills both roles beautifully.My budget would have allowed me to choose any of the prosumer cameras, including the more moderately priced SLR cameras, but given my shooting habits and requirements, none of them looked to be as good a bet at the 5400. And given what I know now about the camera I most likely would purchase the camera again today. The following is a listing of what I like least and best about the Nikon 5400.What I hate about it:1.) The optical viewfinder - The viewfinder has an excellent diopter adjustment, but the camera captures a signifcantly larger area than the viewfinder shows. This makes it very forgiving of sloppy ahooting. You're unlikely to accidently crop someone's head or feet off, but it's impossible to accurately frame an image. (He pauses and spits.)2.) The small size of the LCD - It provides excellent performance in bright ambient lighting, but it's just too small for effective evaluation of the image after capture is completed. It compensates for varying image brightness to make it easier to see the image, but this kills your ability to judge the exposure. You can be in for some surprises when your view images in the computer that looked good in the camera may be underexposed or have blown-out highlights. Thank goodness there's a histogram view you can use to evaluate the exposure.3.) Inferior dust seals on the sliding tube for the zoom lens - You have to be very careful when cleaning the lens on this camera. I don't know if it's a common characteristic, or if I just happened to get one with a bad lens barrel seal, but I put away the canned air after the first couple of times I cleaned the lens. Some tiny fibers apparently blew into the inside and you can see them on the inner element.4.) The small size - Because of the 5400's small size and pretty much non-existant grip I fully expect it to slip out my hand at some point. I will always use a strap and wrap it around my wrist when I'm using this camera.What I love about it:1.) Its superb wide-angle zoom lens. The was a deal maker for me. The widest angle is roughly comparable to a 28mm on a 35mm camera. This is simply not available on many cameras, and it's far superior to using an auxilliary lens to achieve the wide angle.2.) The swiveling LCD - Another deal-maker for me. It allows me use the camera at what would otherwise be very awkward high or low angles.3.) It has an optical viewfinder - Awful as this one is, it does provides a real, live view that never freezes or blacks out at the moment of exposure. The lack of an optical finder is what prevented me from buying the Nilon 8400, which zooms on out to a 24mm equivalent.4.) The small size - This is such a compact camera I can easily carry it along with me at times I would otherwise leave it at home. It fit easily into a jacket pocket, or hangs around my neck all day with no discomfort.5.) Scene Modes -  Especially the Panorama Assist. It's nice to be able to quickly select a scene mode to handle a particular type of shooting situation, such as backlighted portraits.6.) Super-close macro - not as convenient or as versatile as the 990's but still superior to most of them out there. You don't get maximum macro capability unless the lens is nearly at its widest setting, but you can still get very close as long as the macro mode is turned on.", "Date": "August 11, 2005"}, {"Title": "camera needs AF assist illuminator", "Author": "Cees \"shutterbug\"", "ReviewID": "R21TJEVYVIUN1B", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "i've had this camera since Dec 03.  i did extensive research, comparison shopping, and hands-on playing before purchasing this camera.  i was torn between this one, the olympus 5060 zoom, and sony dsc-v1 (since discontinued).i wish i had listened to the repetitive negative reviews regarding the 5400's slow to non-existent low-light AF.  i purchased this camera to document my son's childhood, but have sadly missed precious moments due to this camera's slow focus and shutter lag.  i pretty much prefocus and press the shutter button halfway in my son's direction and wait for a kodak moment to ever have a chance at catching anything.  prefocusing seems to help the shutter lag issue.i was also pleased to have the option for continous burst mode to capture my son's milestones in sequence shots, but please be aware that you will need to know how to set aperture and shutter speeds for proper exposure.  the flash is not usable in this setting and incorrect settings will result in blurred images.the horrible focus issues had me regretting my purchase days after the $700 transaction.  i purchased an additional battery and larger CF cards as well so it was a hefty regret.  i found myself wanting to purchase the V1 since it had a nightframing capability allowing it to focus in darkness, but couldn't justify another $700 purchase.  i unfortunately failed to discuss my return options with the store i purchased it from so i was stuck with the 5400 blind monster.  i have been taking my old reliable 35 mm Minolta with me to events like weddings since i anticipate low-light situations then and the need for a quick-response camera to capture once-in-a-lifetime moments.i love the option of manual controls for more creative shots.  there are a lot of buttons and controls on the camera body so you'll have easy access to them without navigating through the LCD.  however, i can't get past the slow AF issue to fully love this camera.  also, the writing speed is nothing to write home about!  SSSLLLLOOOOOOOWWWWW!  this is not a snappy camera.i will agree that the 5400 is capable of very good shots, but i think it's better suited for still life and landscapes.  and just like every other digicam, images still require photoshop manipulations to correct color balance and saturation, sharpness, and contrast.  i may be more picky than most since i've never printed an image without photoshop editing.i have decided to purchase the older Canon S410.  i have handled a friends S410 and love the EXCELLENT AF especially in low loght even at a long zoom.  the next-to-nothing shutter lag is very impressive.  it also uses CF cards so i can use the 3 Lexar 256 MB cards i already have.  the S410 is also only $250 from this site!  it's only 4MP, but i actually don't mind since i found the 5400's 5 MP setting too noisy and often used the 3.2 setting.  the S410 will also be more pocketable.  perfect for our upcoming summer vacation.  yes, the S410 doesn't have all the manual controls, but right now i just want to get focused and actually capture the moment.  i contemplated getting a Canon SDxxx model, but am hesitant to spend more money on new SD cards.  I'm sure an SDxxx would be even faster, but i'm already impressed with the S410 and i can save some money.i had previously given this camera 4 stars when i started typing this review, but after writing this much, have decided change it to 3.  i hope this helps.", "Date": "May 25, 2005"}, {"Title": "A Pro's camera", "Author": null, "ReviewID": "RE81IYZ9DXWLD", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Having had some doubt about the ability to get high performance from a digital camera (below stratospheric costs), I decide to try the Nikon 5400.

The old 990 had proved to be a dependable workhorse; other than some self-inflicted problems that occurred after I spilled some sugary soda on it (I had to have it professionally cleaned to the tune of $200!), it never let me down. Still, I'm getting more serious about my photography, and wanted something with better resolution and more advanced options.I had been really looking forward to receiving the 5400 and was predisposed to liking the camera a lot. In reality, I soured on the thing within 72 hours.First of all, BELIEVE what camera cognoscenti say about the inability of the 5400 to autofocus in low-light conditions. What I hadn't understood until I was shooting with the camera is that 'low light' doesn't necessarily refer to broom closets or dinners by candlelight. I was snapping pics of my two-year-old in the living room today, on a sunny afternoon, with the blinds mostly open. Half the time, I couldn't get the camera to lock no matter what. Moving to the hallway, where there's only indirect light sthat streams in from the living room and dining room, effectively rendered the camera inoperable. I encountered no such problems outside, so if the great outdoors is where you do all your shooting, the 5400 may be for you.Except for one other thing -- and this is a biggie. What absolutely DESTROYS this camera's performance is its pathetic color accuracy. Maybe I got a lemon -- I find it hard to believe that Nikon, the top-of-the heap manufacturer of pro-quality imaging equipment, would release a model that is so wildly off in how the internal chip processes color. But at least with the specimen I have, all the colors come out hyped. I photographed a still life that included some salmon-colored paper; it acquired a distinct, troublesome reddish tint in the picture I took with the 5400. This is a CRITICAL area for any camera; if it doesn't render reds and pinks accurately, it's an almost useless tool, as Caucasian faces, especially, will look ruddy and unappealing. And my 5400 has trouble with other hues, too, first turning a purplish blue shirt into a something much more like ROYAL blue, then pulling the exact same feat with a baby blue yogurt lid in another still life. It makes no sense to me either, but there it is.I spent HOURS tweaking white balance and playing with the camera's saturation settings, all to little avail. Was the 5400's (too-small) display at fault, perhaps, as opposed to its internal color-rendering chip? I wish. After transferring the pictures to my Mac G4 and opening them in Photoshop 7, the same problems were immediately evident on the big monitor. To a degree, the 'off' colors can be corrected in Photoshop, of course. But sorry Nikon, I'm not prepared to do that kind of digital cosmetic surgery on virtually every picture I take.My old Nikon 990 has better color accuracy by a mile; so does a more recent four-megapixel Canon A70 point-and-shoot that a friend was using to photograph the same test scenes on which I trained the 5400.I should note that I am not a professional photographer, and that I'm probably much more forgiving of mild deviations in color and sharpness than a pro lensman would be. But the problems I mentioned are far from mild. They were, in fact, easily picked up and commented on by my wife, who is supremely uninterested in tweaky, geeky stuff, and who would presumably be happy with an old Kodak Brownie if it took halfway decent pictures.I still give the 5400 two stars because the macro pictures it takes are nothing short of astounding (if you can forget about the patently incorrect colors for a moment). A picture of the engraving inside a ring brought out awesome detail, even specks of dust and scratches that were hard to pick up with the naked eye. A photo of a piece of transparent sticky tape I'd pulled off an envelope showed paper fibers in such detail, it seemed that by zooming in just one step further, actual atoms would appear in the image...Still, all told, I'm sorely disappointed, and so this camera is going back to Amazon for a refund.

Unfortunately it cost $999. The 5400 is the 5000's replacement and is superior in most ways, and 4 years later, I have my hands on it for a quarter of what the 5000 cost in 2002.In my opinion this is the best wide-angle digicam currently available at the price of $250 used. The Canon G5 is selling for more than this camera purely on its brand name. This camera is pretty much neck and neck with it and you will get a good deal on it because it does not have the Canon logo on it. In short, with the Nikon you sacrifice the faster lens for a wider lens.What I like about the Coolpix 5400:- Nice 28mm wide angle- 5mp is plenty for the 1 1/8\" sensor size - do you really think a current 8mp camera can resolve 8mp of detail onto a 1 1/8\" sensor?- Fast startup time- Smaller than the G5, too large for a pocket but small enough for a sweatshirt pouch- Good battery - rated only 680mAH but still lasts quite a while, charges quickly, and is easy to pop in and out compared to other cameras that use 4 AAs- RAW support with 1.4 firmware (download from Nikon's website)- Nice array of buttons, not a lot of poking around in the menus necessary, common functions all have a button. Takes some time to learn them all, but once you do they make you faster and more efficient. I even wish it had one or two extra user-definable buttons.- LCD is visible even in direct sunlight, and its small size saves the battery- Flip-and-twist LCD is one of those \"How did I ever get by without one of these before\" things- Panorama assist is nice, unfortunately it only supports JPEG and not RAW- High quality build, except for the battery & CF compartment covers- Black cameras just look so much cooler than silver onesWhat I don't like about this camera:- Slow lens (max f/2.8, decreases with telephoto)- ISO 50-400 (small 1 1/8\" sensor would be too noisy at higher sensitivities)- HORRIBLE low-light camera - no AF assist lamp and if the autofocus even works at all under normal incandescent room lighting, you'll be lucky- Vignetting in the upper left corner at full wide angle and maximum aperture- Colors on the LCD look washed out - many photos that look dull on the LCD actually look fantastic, causing you to question whether the photo you just took is any good- Tripod mount is not centered underneath the lens and is plastic- Doesn't support USB 2- Slow CF write speed- Camera is unresponsive while draining the buffer onto the CF card- Only supports 2GB CF cards max- Locks up too frequently (seemingly every 75 shots when I shoot in RAW and keep taxing the buffer) - have to reinsert the battery and I usually lose a couple of the photos I just took- Slow shutter response and shot-to-shot time - terrible for sports or any kind of action- Very awkward in my hand - I have normal-sized hands and I simply cannot hold this camera securely with one hand. The grip sticks out enough but is too narrow. I have to rest the camera on my pinky to keep it from falling out of my hand.- \"Quick review\" is not quick since you have to press it twice for it to be usefulEvery camera has strengths and weaknesses, every camera is a tradeoff and this camera makes some \"unique\" tradeoffs.

This is a review of a camera not a judgement of people and their eyesight or if they knock the camera they \"can't afford it or don't understand it. As stated I have years of photographic experience and compared the camera to the Nikon Coolpix 990. I have had the 990 since the first day it came out (about 3 years ago) and it has been one of Nikons biggest selling digital for many reasons. I also campared it to the camera it's ment to replace , the Coolpix 5000. In my review I stated many people will like this camera and it does take good pictures, but compared to the new technology that's out there and the compitition from other camera makers (Canons new G5 for instance, and I don't own any Canon products) the 5400 as a whole is a disappiontment.  People shouldn't write a review based on having a product for a week and comparing it to nothing.I've used Nikons for over twenty years. I have always expected improvements with new models and most time they didn't disappoint. I loved (and still do) my Coolpix 990. The 5400 is a downer. First, it's made in Korea! The smaller sensor is stretched for quality. The dull 1.5\" LCD screen is also a step in the wrong direction (if you can even see the image on it). Nikon's older 5000 had a larger chip and 1.8\" screen. Nikon should be making better cameras. Cameras with larger chips and a nice 2\" LCD (don't be fooled when they say the smaller chip is better technology, not!) Many people will love this camera and say they get great pictures with it. With the right know-how and software you can get excellnt images with a 2-3 MP camera. It's cute and does have a great amount of features (why I gave it 3 stars). If you want better images get one of the new SLR's.For your money stay with what you have ( 2-3 MP) or spend half the money and get a 3 or 4 MP (from [Amazon.com]) and wait for a better product from Nikon or something from the competition that's more reasonably priced...", "Date": "July 1, 2003"}, {"Title": "Sounds great, but doesn't deliver", "Author": "\"ow1n\"", "ReviewID": "R3SJIXC4FU4Q6M", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "This camera looked like the perfect thing--many of the same capabilities as the 5700, but a more compact body.  I was very excited when it arrived. After using it for a while, though, I realized what a mistake I'd made.  Number one problem: focus.  The camera has no auto-focus assist lamp, and does a TERRIBLE job of focusing in indoor light situations.  Nikon would have us believe that the flash is normally required for those times, but my 4-year-old Canon Powershot S10 handles similar situations perfectly.  In fact, the Powershot S10 outperforms the 5400 in a lot of ways.  Compounding the problem of the 5400's inept autofocusing is the small, grainy LCD.  So even if it looks like your picture's in focus, chances are when you see them full-size you'll realize they weren't.

It has a large number of useful features for it's price.  Aperture and shutter priority, Programmed auto, and Full Manual along with more than 10 preset modes including multi-directional panorama, and other surprisingly useful modes.  You will not be disappointed with the scene options.3. Macro is incredible. Being unable to afford a 600 or 700 dollar Macro lens for my D-SLR I sometimes find myself still using the Coolpix 5400 for macro shots.  This is where the camera really shines.  I can literally touch the subject with the lens and still get focus most of the time in good lighting.4. Easy to use.  Important features are all easily accessible.5. Price.  If your looking for a good point and click with lots of features and good image quality for less than a hundred this old lady will treat you right.  Also keep in mind that most accessories are extremely cheap as well.6. ISO 50-400 could be considered a bad thing but it means the camera is well equipped to take excellent photos in good to cloudy lighting and fair indoor lighting.  Even modern point and click cameras take poor, grainy pictures with any higher ISO anyways.7. Flip-out LCD screen with huge range of motion. It flips out all the way and rotates 360 degrees allowing for all manner of camera angles. Need a mirror? Just flip out the screen and point the camera at yourself.8. Many affordable accessories.9. It has a video mode with sound. This is a gimmick however, I wouldn't record anything important with it.CONS:Keep in mind this is an outdated camera, so it's cons in the modern market may be more than you can take.1. 5.1 MP, which means the images can only be enlarged so much.  This also means that the digital zoom (beyond the normal 4x zoom) is nearly worthless.2. The battery life of the Nikon EL-E1 battery which comes with it is fairly short.  I would recommend purchasing 1 or 2 3rd party battery replacements (you can buy 2 for less than 10 dollars from a 3rd party that have twice the battery life).2. FPS.  When not on continuous shot mode (or one of it's numerous other multiple pic shot modes) it takes pictures fairly slowly.  One of my biggest annoyances with this camera was the 1-3 seconds between pictures in single shot mode.3. Start-up time. Plan on waiting 2-4 seconds before taking your first shot after turning the camera on.4. Crappy viewfinder.  I have always used to LCD screen, which has a little more than 90% accuracy (your photo will be larger than what you see on the LCD screen)5. Has been known to lock up at times.  This is not a normal occurrence but it can be bothersome.  I have found that turning off the camera, removing the battery, then reinserting the battery and turning it back on seems to solve whatever issue the camera is having with little to no loss of images.6. Slow internal picture organizing.  I wouldn't take the time to delete individual pictures from my memory card using the camera.  Just plug it into a computer.  Card formatting is fast enough though.All in all I would still recommend this camera to bargain shoppers looking to take some high quality pictures.  With the price of the camera and 2 new batteries you are looking at a $110 investment with the guarantee of sharp pictures, strong features, and extremely good macro capability in the point and click genre. It's main issues are it's slow picture taking speed and somewhat low megapixels which make it obsolete in today's market.  Because of this you are getting an extremely low price on an otherwise high quality camera.", "Date": "May 8, 2009"}, {"Title": "great manual mode", "Author": "rubenpjr40 \"buff\"", "ReviewID": "R1D4TAQNMBOBL", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I've heard many negative reports about the 5400 but I am well pleased with mine mostly because of it's many modes and especially manual mode.It's easy to operate and intuitive.", "Date": "July 12, 2007"}, {"Title": "Great Pictures", "Author": "David Perry \"nghtshde\"", "ReviewID": "R162D97B7QEVKM", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I have been looking at cameras for quite a while but was having a very difficult time deciding if a digital camera would take the type of pictures I am used to with a 35mm.

Nikon still has some of the the best macro capabilities (very important to me) out there, but the 5400 is not as good as the 4500, 995, etc, rotating body style cameras.When in macro mode, the autofocus wants to hunt.  The lens on the 5400 protrudes from the camera body and moves in and out when zooming.  The bulk of the camera and protruding lens tends to shadow the maco subject more than the rotating body Coolpix cameras.  Unfortunately, the SL-1 LED ringlight will not work with the 5400, so keep a flashlight handy!In fact, most of the accessories that work on the 4500 (etc...) will not work with many of Nikon's newer cameras- a huge waste of my money on accessories that are now essentially useless.

I rarely used this camera because it's so SLOW and inconvenient to use.  Also, one of the times I actually did use it, it fell off my coffee table and onto the carpeted floor and jammed the zoom and totally quit working.  I couldn't believe that it was so fragile!  I sent it off for Nikon to fix and it cost over 200 dollars to fix!  Yet another shocker! It takes nice pictures most of the time, but as others have mentioned, often they turn out hazey in certain lighting.  I'm just disgusted that so much money has been invested in a camera that I've never enjoyed using.  The one I just purched cost 1/4 of the amount that has been spent on this nikon.

She purchased it from an online store (NOT Amazon, as she should have done)who called her for \"confirmation\" at which time the salesman talked her into a very expensive (over $200) filter add-on which is nearly useless and could be bought elsewhere for under $30. I should have waited for the d70 for just a little more money (actually I now have a d70 and it is amazing!). The 5400 takes great wide-angle shots, so you would think it would be a good camera for interior pictures, but it is hampered by its poor autofocus habits in low light. The 5400 is small, but its odd configuration means you will have to carry it in a larger case than you would expect. Images are generally very good, but the lcd is so small, you won't find it very useful for composition.I also had the same experience as another reviewer, the tiny screws holding one of the strap lugs stripped out and gummed up the lens mechanism. This caused a complete breakdown. As it was just out of warranty, I opted to have it repaired at my expense($150), but now wish I hadn't. Nikon should make good on this issue, as I suspect it is far more common than they will admit.
