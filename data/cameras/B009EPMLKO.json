{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Another Casio winner", "Author": "D. Foss \"debnh\"", "ReviewID": "R3B8A1Z1L0E9W1", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "First let me say, I was scared to death to purchase a camera in Japanese language setting and not be able to switch it to English.  BUT it was so easy to find the setting.  Literally took me 3 seconds to figure it out and I'm not that tech savvy!  Don't be deterred by this, you can do it. I used the CASIO website, opened up the manual and read up on it before purchasing.  So glad I did.This is my 2nd CASIO Exilim.  Previous model was the EX-S10 that I've owned for about 5 years and traveled the world with it; literally.  However my favorite camera lacked nighttime photo quality, as many point & shoots do.  It was time to update and so I began debating the top notch name-brand cameras on the market such as Nikon, Cannon and Sony. Sadly I was not impressed with their speed and functionality. I found myself going back to CASIO.The CASIO EX-ZR1000 is everything in one neat little package!  It's quick, turn the power button on and it's ready within seconds to take a shot.  There is panoramic built into the camera, no need to \"attach\" photos when you upload them onto your computer. The HDR and ART photos so far have been amazing; and fun! Premium Auto Pro function is great for when I'm being lazy and don't want to fuss with adjustments and still get great shots. Also has Best Shot which makes colors pop. The ZR1000 feels solid in your hands, not plastic and flimsy.  Flash works great, not overbearing and blinding but bright enough.  There are advanced settings for more advanced users and simple settings for those of us who just want a good shot every time!", "Date": "October 29, 2013"}, {"Title": "Very fast, quality pictures!", "Author": "bigstudio", "ReviewID": "R3GCZOHS0NOHN2", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Just what I wanted, the camera was as fast as advertised [30 still frames per second], many higher end features [raw image capture, many manual features, HDR, focus ring, 1080p video, etc.].

Like me ,also a Photog. , I have grown tired of luggiing the \"heavieyes)s\" around, 1D's and 5D's with the glass.So looking for a quality alternative ,I took a look. I was impressed so I ordered one and havent looked back since. The camera is way more than I expected in still and video possibilities. Too many features to list here and I keep finding more.Its not to replace the DSLR, Just to have a pocket cam that will do everything I need it to do in a very quick pinch.Excellent resolution Very reachable 300mm digi zoom ( yes) to a 14mm uber wide aspect.With lots more tricks in between.I would buy this camera again and I do recommend you do too, at least give it some consideration. The price is right, only thing : this camera is not available in stores in the U.S.. It comes with Japanese instructions and starts in the same language. English is available online.", "Date": "April 28, 2014"}, {"Title": "Good", "Author": "Yuzhen Zhang", "ReviewID": "R2XA7FWMDS54CA", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Althougt the flash is not as well as TR but its still very good and valuable, try to use it in a light place.", "Date": "September 10, 2013"}, {"Title": "Excellent social camera. Not for photo snobs.", "Author": "tomahagne \"...\"", "ReviewID": "R17BOZITPLMNXP", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "The BEST thing about this camera is the swiveling view-screen for self-portraits. It may seem trivial at first until you use it. My wife and I used this to take photos of ourselves in front of landmarks and on hiking trails in Puerto Rico where there's sometimes no one around to take your photo, or when everyone's so busy taking their own photos, they can't be bothered. And let's not forget the language barrier. The lens is wide enough to capture a fair bit of background at arm's length. The hands-free trigger is genius. The screen swings both ways so you can tilt it up to take really low shots from the ground and you can tilt it down to shoot downwards at arm's length.The SECOND best thing about this camera is the Best Shot. It captures several images in a short burst and pieces the best elements together. This ensures excellent exposure at multiple distances. And it's pretty seamless. There're hardly any artifacts for something that's so processed. It's nearly impossible to take a poor photo!Those 2 alone make this camera worth every penny.We also appreciated the light weight, attractive appearance, big optical zoom, large swiveling view screen, and decent ergonomics. We haven't really delved into the other neat features like high-speed video and various Art Shots.I will call the images \"pretty good\". They're more than enough for 4\"x6\" vacation photos, but you won't be submitting them to any photography magazines or blowing them up too big.I think this is perfectly suited for social photographers that enjoy lots of pictures of their friends and/or with friends in front of landmarks and monuments or at dark parties/restaurants. It's not really catered towards artsy photographers.", "Date": "November 21, 2013"}, {"Title": "Works great!", "Author": "he cong", "ReviewID": "R3LUKZPJK68XO9", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Love everything about this camera, only down side is it is kinda hard to take picture when you flip the screen up.", "Date": "April 17, 2013"}, {"Title": "Great deal!", "Author": "Peter P", "ReviewID": "R3Q4T51TNC8WQ9", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Amazing camera with great functions and the price is right, much cheaper than if I were to buy locally. Can't complain, bought it for the slo-mo function, works as it should, just remember to film in bright light to prevent grainy dark videos. Also, indoor lights and screens will flicker in highspeed videos, so you may want to invest in studio lights or something like that if you are into taking slo-mo videos. Shoots fast for normal use, battery last for quite a while, you may want to get extra batteries if you are using it for long outdoor activities though. I have 4 batteries and I went on a tour for a day, was up to my last battery at the 10-hour point when the day ended, safe to say that I wouldn't run out for 12 hours+ with 4 batts. Absolutely love it, using my phone for taking photos lesser and lesser, LOL", "Date": "May 18, 2014"}, {"Title": "very good", "Author": "yingpan", "ReviewID": "R3MV7K0BPG9IDU", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This camera take a picture very beauty I like it\uff01ems is ok no quick no slow~Good camera like appearance", "Date": "September 6, 2013"}, {"Title": "awesome!", "Author": "lisachen", "ReviewID": "R3W1NXR3NOUUMH", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "it's really a good camera have so many function, its much greater than casio TR serises. you will like it!", "Date": "January 25, 2013"}, {"Title": "Good job", "Author": "Emma Li", "ReviewID": "R1AKG68FT17KMY", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Nice shoot and amazing result.
