The body is beautiful and sleek.  It feels solid with the metal frame and no cheap plastic parts.

Night shots haven been excellent as well.PROS:* Image quality* Night shots* HD Video* ZOOM while recording movies (not many other cameras can do this)* Great looks* Sturdy cameraCONS:* No lens cover* No button for recording video (have to use the menu instead)", "Date": "September 9, 2009"}, {"Title": "Panasonic Lumix DMC-FP8", "Author": "Chuck", "ReviewID": "R1WL7SMPYD1YL4", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I bought this camera to replace a very old Kodak.  I picked the Lumix FP8 because of it's speed.  I wanted a camera that would take consecutive pictures without much hesitation.  I used it last weekend at a wedding for the first time; and the pictures turned out pretty good.  I have a love/hate relationship with the size; it's great because it fits easily in about any pocket, but it is so small I feel a bit clumsy operating the controls.  I have to concentrate on holding such a small camera still so I don't get camera shake.  It would be nice to have a viewfinder in addition to the screen for better stabilization.  Overall, I like the camera and would recommend it.", "Date": "September 26, 2009"}, {"Title": "Pleased", "Author": "J.

I am very pleased.  The one caution is that you have to be careful to not get your finger in the way of the lens - this camera is very thin and it is easy to do.", "Date": "February 5, 2010"}, {"Title": "Love it!", "Author": "SR", "ReviewID": "R3CK531NAMGO8G", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Very fast time for 1st and 2nd picture taken!  Finally I'm not missing moments because of a slow camera.  I used Consumer Reports to make this decision and I'm very happy with it!", "Date": "April 8, 2010"}, {"Title": "It does its job, but it feels cheap", "Author": "Norma R Ryan", "ReviewID": "R15VI0NAEJPGCZ", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "The camera itself looks slick, but I really disliked the cheap-feeling buttons and overall plastic-y functions. It's an okay camera for the money and takes fine pictures. The menus can be irritating to navigate through; I like using built-in features but navigating through them is kind of a hassle on this camera. I probably would not get a Panasonic next time around; I went for an upgrade and got the Canon Elph... pretty pleased with it and the extra hundred is well worth it in just about every arena.", "Date": "July 8, 2011"}, {"Title": "a good little camera", "Author": "Don T. Hun", "ReviewID": "R3KJ0VJRULH4LX", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I like this little camera.  The only problem I have is not having a separate view finder.  I have to remember to keep my finger out of the way of the lens.  I am used to viewfinders, not just looking at screens.
