{"Reviews": [{"Title": "With 25mm f1.8 the EM10 is 95 Percent as Sharp as my Sony A7 with Zeiss 50mm f1.8 ...", "Author": "stephen", "ReviewID": "R3P1JVWBL7M2LQ", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "[UPDATE March 18 2014 dpreview just awarded the OMD EM10 its Gold Award]I pixel peep ... a lot ... I figure if it's sharp at 100% crop, it's sharp period. I do pro street photography and primarily use the Sony A7 with a variety of lenses, but my go to lens is the Zeiss 55mm f1.8. This lens has been DXO tested to be second only to the the $4,000 Otus lens. All that to say ... it's SHARP.  I recently got my OM-D E-M10 after comparing the images to the O-MD E-M1 and others costing much more. So ... I bought it.[WORKS FOR MY STYLE OF SHOOTING]I have a Sony NEX-6 with the excellent Sony G Lens 18-105mm. I use the NEX-6 as a backup to the A7. However I wanted something smaller to carry with me when I was not specifically on a street shoot. I thought about using the NEX-6 as my casual camera. It's small, but I really wanted something with the full manual control set that was like the A7. The NEX-6, while good, did not replicate the control buttons and dials of the A7. Plus the NEX lenses really added to the size of the NEX-6. But the EM10 used much smaller lenses and was completely customizable, AND had the two control dials just like my A7 ... one in the front on the top right, and one in the rear on the top right. I shoot in Manual mode and use the front dial (which I can easily turn with my index finger) to change shutter speed. I use the rear dial (which is placed perfectly for my thumb) to change Aperture for effect or bokeh, etc. Since the A7 has an Auto ISO that functions during Manual mode, it controls my exposure mostly for me. Not every camera has an Auto ISO capability that functions in Manual mode. The EM10 does. And I can set the upper and lower limits for ISO to use so I never get too much noise by going too high in the Auto ISO selection process. So between the two dial functionality being the same between the A7 and the EM10, and the availability of AUTO ISO in Manual mode and ISO bracketing on both cameras, I can use the same controls and the same setup for either camera.[PRO LEVEL IMAGE QUALITY FOR MOST WORK]Now for the good part ... The image quality on the EM10 is literally 95% of the image quality of my full frame A7 (both using the good glass). I'm talking about at full 100% crop. Now, to be sure, the EM10 is not an exact A7 equivalent. The 95% holds true only in reasonable light. In the lowest light the EM10, though good ... and slightly better than most APS-C cameras like the NEX-6, is simply no match for the full frame A7. But, for the money, and with the Olympus 25mm f1.8 lens, the little EM10 is excellent, and even is 95% of the image quality and capability (fast AF and 8fps vs 10fps, etc) of the EM1 to my eyes (in decent light). And the in-camera image stabilization makes it an even better bargain than many cameras. In fact, though I bought the camera to use as a third level camera in my \"fleet\", I am absolutely convinced it is slightly better than my NEX-6 with good glass. And I'm a Sony guy that owns an RX100 (by the way, the EM10 is significantly better than the 100 even though I love the little RX100), and an RX1 along with the NEX-6 and A7. I shot with the kit 14-42 Olympus, but it is not in the same league as the 25mm f1.8 Olympus glass. So I simply keep the better lens on the camera. I have found I can crop in on the raw EM10 image shot with the better glass and get the equivalent magnification the 14-42 would have given me by zoom ... and the f1.8 image is still better than or equal to the uncropped, zoomed-in image of the kit lens.[COMPARISONS TO THE O-MD E-M1]So, it's a go everywhere little camera that absolutely can replace my full frame A7 in a lot of my work. I'm simply amazed. I think the little EM10 just kicked my NEX-6 out of second place in my arsenal. The best part IMHO is that the EM10 is 90% of the camera the EM1 is ... to me. I don't need the weather sealing and would never knowingly take a weather sealed camera into a downpour anyway. But that's just the nature of my work I guess. Perhaps some people don't have an option and must be in the weather. I wanted to shoot a few thousand shots before I reviewed the little gem. The focus speed is virtually identical between the EM1 and the EM10. The same image processor gives practically the same noiseless higher ISO image quality. The EM1 has a slightly better image quality due to the lack of an anti aliasing filter, and the EM1 snaps 10fps vs 8fps for the EM10. The 3 axis image stabilization on the EM10 does about 85% of the work the 5 axis stablization of the EM1 does because the EM10 keeps the 3 most important corrections (yaw, roll and pitch).[STREET PHOTOGRAPHY PRACTICAL CONSIDERATIONS]The only thing I miss from the A7 is the location of the power switch. I carry my A7 on a wrist strap in my right hand and I always have my index finger on the power switch so that, within a second or so, I can turn the camera on and have it up to my eye and catching the moments. Then I simply switch it back off on the way back down to my side. I have found that when I operate like that I routinely can take over a thousand photographs on a single A7 battery charge. With normal CIPA measurements the reviews have the A7 at around 350 shots before the battery expires. All that to say that the position of the power switch on the lower back right of the EM10 means I cannot be ready quite as fast. BUT ... the EM10 has a setting that lets the camera go blank and save power after one to five (I think five?) minutes. Once it goes blank, it is saving power, but a single press of any key brings it back to life instantly ... so my situation is mitigated.  Therefore, I just leave it in that 1 minute-to-power save mode and the battery lasts good amount of time. Not everybody uses the CIPA method of using a camera with flash and extensive LCD viewing of images. Once you realize just how much of the battery those two activities use, you can change your habits and realize a lot more battery life per charge.[CONCLUSIONS]All in all, I am very, very happy with this little camera. I feel it is perfectly capable, in the right light, of producing professional results for output even to large format. I hope an upgrade someday includes an Exposure Compensation dial that works in Manual Mode as well as others and an HDR dynamic range mode that does not disable Auto ISO when in Manual mode. But, even as it is,  the little O-MD E-M10 is a breeze and a pleasure to use and carry around. I take it practically everywhere I go. It's small enough and high quality build enough ... with professional features and controls ... to be a revolutionary replacement for larger cameras in a lot of DSLR work. But it's not too small making it uncomfortable to use for pro photography. And the price is right. Great job Olympus!", "Date": "March 5, 2014"}, {"Title": "An absolute gem!

Chaney", "ReviewID": "R21J6FH6V7CBG8", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This camera takes good pictures.

I will strongly consider the E-M5's successor when it is released, as having a weather-sealed version of this camera, without giving up WiFi or focus peaking, would be nice.[About this reviewer: I'm upgrading from an Olympus E-PL1 and Panasonic GF3 (rarely used) to this camera. I've been seriously interested in photography as a hobby for about 18 months, and have closely followed many of the product releases in the last 9 months waiting for a camera that I felt would be a good fit for my budget and perceived needs.]GOOD PICTURESThe 16MP micro four thirds sensor used on this camera combined with the internal software and image processor (the latter designated the TruePic VII and found here for the first time outside of the company's flagship E-M1 model) is capable of capturing images that are suitable for every consumer grade digital application and printing at any size short of poster. With very few caveats, the micro four thirds lenses and sensors are considered to perform at a level equal to or highly competitive with APS-C (\"crop sensor\") and all other sub-\"full frame\" mirrorless cameras. There's nothing about the E-M10 that breaks this pattern, and indeed some reports suggest that the already very usable \"high\" ISOs have been improved upon from it's predecessors, including the E-M5.Auto focus is quick and in my testing so far accurate and reliable. I have run across a couple of shots with the Olympus 45mm f1.8 where I was trying to shoot inside the minimum focusing distance and auto-focus could not be achieved, in which case the camera would scan the full focal range about twice in what felt like about 1.5 sec before taking the picture. Auto white balance has been effective in indoor and outdoor lighting both, including facing fluorescent, incandescent, mixed, and cloudy conditions; I haven't yet caught one of the few sunny moments of this weekend through my lens. To complete my assessment of the \"auto\" features, the maximum auto ISO can be specified via the menu system, and you can configure from a set of options as to which shooting modes present auto ISO as an option.In camera JPEGs are pleasingly rendered, and a few helpful in-camera transitions are readily available. Specifically, the Olympus art filters can be batch applied to a RAW image, and a \"e-Portrait\" option has so far been pretty effective at detecting and smoothing the apparent imperfections in the skin of my subjects. Unfortunately, the RAW format ORF files are not yet recognized by the latest version of Adobe Photoshop Lightroom [5.3], but I don't expect that to hold true much longer.TECHNICAL FEATURESThe grab bag of technical features of this camera can certainly be overwhelming to consider if you are unfamiliar with the OM-D stablemates [at present time the E-M1 and E-M5] as well as the higher-end offerings of Olympus' competitors, notably the Panasonic GX7. Rather than trying to cover them all, I'll focus on what stands out to me about this camera apart from the sensor and processor covered above.*Viewfinder: The built-in viewfinder has diopter adjustment, an eye detect sensor [configurable and disabled when the tilting screen is pulled away from the camera body], and automatically adjusts brightness to match the scene through the lens which should prove beneficial in night shooting. Additionally, it is a true 3-color display unlike the sequential display used in the GX7, though it doesn't tilt. I did encounter some distracting image jumpiness/lag while panning to capture a black puppy running on white snow right around my feet, but in every other application it has been more than adequately fast.*3-Axis Image Stabilization: Unlike the 5-axis IS utilized in the other OM-D models, the E-M10 can compensate \"only\" for yaw, pitch, and roll. Movement of the camera up-down and side-to-side cannot be compensated for. In any event, I feel like it's a significant improvement over that of my E-PL1 and adequate to my needs. It's also nice to know that it will work in video mode, as recently demonstrated by Blunty on YouTube. Unlike lens based stabilization, it also works with legacy lenses like my Olympus OM-mount Zuiko 50mm f1.4. One complaint is that there's a moderately audible mechanical \"ocean\" sound that appears when the IS is doing its job, which I have configured to happen during a half shutter press.*WiFi: Based on the shared features and similar body-only cost of the E-M5 I had long considered jumping at that camera, but the lack of the WiFi options in that model (limited support via EyeFi cards which are costly and not 100% compatible) were a deal-breaker for my interest in rapidly sharing pictures via social media. The expanded Olympus WiFi offerings first found on the Pen E-P5 are more than I had hoped for, and the degree of control I have via the OIS (Olympus Image Share) app and my tablet/smartphone are great. I look forward to future iterations of the app, and also hope to someday have the 14-42 \"EZ\" lens so that I can play with electronic zoom remotely!*Focus Peaking: Another nice function added to this model and not found in the E-M5 is focus peaking. It works pretty well, though did have some difficulty with my 50mm f1.4 (~30 year old lens) wide open. It's also a bit disappointing that it doesn't have a color option (e.g. red/blue) but is limited to black and white.*Built-in Flash vs. \"Missing\" features: It's worth pointing out that the E-M10 has a built-in flash (+1) and lacks any degree of claimed weather-sealing (-1). If WiFi functionality isn't central to how you intend to use your camera, you should strongly consider the E-M5 as the small and low guide number flash isn't anything exceptional. But it does have a very satisfying \"pop-up\" action, a seemingly capable catch in the closed position, and despite what I believe to be a plastic construction a relatively congruous appearance with the metal top plate [in the silver finish model, anyways].*Video: From specifications I know this camera will capture either Full HD 1080 or HD 720 footage at 30 progressive frames per second. Those are the video options. Oh, and it has a built in stereo microphone. If you are a videographer this probably isn't the camera for you, but as I'm a stills photographer who might want to capture 45 seconds of \"Happy Birthday\" being sung at my nephew's next party in order to share it with relatives who couldn't be there, this camera *will* do that - unlike the 4 times as expensive Nikon Df. [Had to say it.]EASE OF USEIt's almost unfair to compare this camera to the E-PL1 as they sit several years, a product line, and in general worlds apart in the photographic food chain in terms of their handling. That, however, is the camera with which I was previously most familiar and let me tell you the handling of this model is simply streets ahead. The touchscreen, twin control dials, and (once unlocked) Super Control Panel (SCP) user interface are a beautiful combination allowing me to easily control aperture, shutter speed, ISO, and white balance. And about 20 other features/functions, including specifying if the auto focus should target eyes, the left eye, the right eye (no joke, those are options)... it's really a powerful and well designed screen.I won't sugarcoat it and say the Olympus detailed system menus aren't daunting, or claim that there's a valid reason not to ship the camera with the SCP enabled by default. But I sat down and played with the menus for between 30 minutes and 2 hours and got the camera set in a way that I'm reasonably happy with. Now I get to enjoy using it and make small tweaks to my preferred use of the configurable function buttons (and d-pad buttons) as I get more familiar. It's not the end of the world, and oh are those twin control dials a pleasure to use. For my money, they're in just the right place and feel like they have just the right amount of clickiness; I'm unfamiliar with other such dials, but was having read at some online review sites that they felt the dials turned too easily I can't help but feel like they're either being extremely picky or had slightly differently weighted dials on their copy of the camera.BUILD & APPEARANCEFirst, the camera is smaller than you're thinking. Unless you've held one in person in the last 2 hours, your probably imagining it's bigger than it really is. I had held the E-M5 and E-M1 at my local camera store, but I still wasn't 100% prepared for what I removed from the box. It's not small in a bad way - I'm 5'11\" and have fairly large hands and find it very manageable - but it's a very pleasantly compact package that fits in my coat pocket with the 45mm f1.8 native m43 lens attached.Second, it looks and feels very solid in the hand. Anyone holding this camera will recognize it's a serious photographic tool. Again, not in a bad way - I don't find it's at all overly heavy, and I would say it is very well balanced. But it feels like it's meant to be used in the real world, even as it looks nice enough to be proudly displayed on a shelf.Final Note: It's Sunday afternoon, and my camera was received mid-day Thursday, so don't consider this a definitive source on longevity and niggling UI details, but rather my initial impressions.", "Date": "February 9, 2014"}, {"Title": "Comes across as a \"poor man's\" E-M1 ...", "Author": "GoDark", "ReviewID": "R1OP4S1UULL5L4", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "The E-M10 had a special appeal to me as a \"poor man's\" E-M1, given its mix of E-M1 and E-M5 technologies at a much lower price.

And if I do, I have learned a few techniques to minimize exposure.  That and the fact that most of the lens offerings aren't even weather sealed makes it less of an issue too since one will still have to protect the lens in some way in most cases.The lack of 5 axis IBIS seems to be a non-issue so far.  And what I think it gains that is HUGE is less to almost no shutter shock.  Shutter shock is why I sent the E-M1 back.The savings vs the E-M1 allowed me to get 2 more lenses, the 25mm f/1.8 and the 14-42EZ (still waiting) for compact pocketability.The files are top notch m4/3.  Not the same quality as the X-trans from Fuji, but the combination of the lens line-up and portability seem to make up for it.I wish the battery/memory card compartment were easier to open and would pop open once unlatched like the E-M1.  Instead you have to unlatch it and then get your finger tip under the edge to open it.  Also, the compartment can't be opened when a tripod plate is attached (very, very annoying).Having the built-in flash is great for spur of the moment fill flash.Dials don't have the tight detents I expected, but aren't loose either.  Should be fine in the long run.  Buttons are a bit clicky.  I think people like this for the feedback, but there is a bit of cheapness to the feel.  Nitpicking here.

I'm coming from using SLRs in the past, and then chucking them for point and shoots cuz I was in the backcountry a lot and tired of carrying all that junk. But I now think m4/s have gotten to the place where I wanted to try a camera with better resolution, manual controls, and lens choice. I was using a Panasonic superzoom and loved the camera.This thing is small and light, and if you get the EZ lens it's quite small. But without being so tiny it's hard to operate controls. The LCD is fairly bright, but you still need the EVF outdoors. I definitely dislike the fact that the monitor in back doesn't flip over; you can set the camera on it's back and do some major damage to that screen. Careful.I am very impressed with the image quality, but I'm just an amateur. It isn't just the better lenses than the P&S; cameras I've been using, it's the control over shooting parameters. But the nice thing about this camera is that I can put it on all auto and it behaves just like a simple P&S.; Versatile.Unlike some other brands I was considering, Panasonic and Olympus have a 300mm zoom, which I wanted for wildlife pictures. I've found so far it works handheld with the in-body stabilization just fine; probably helps that the ergonomics of the camera with that lens are conducive to handheld. For outdoors stuff the tilting monitor in back, availability of macro tubes, time lapse, sweep panorama, and especially wifi remote control are very useful.Olympus, and indeed other manufacturers, need to make more use of wifi. This camera has a nice implementation, but I don't see why they don't have the ability to connect to a laptop. On any wifi camera using wifi to transfer images is painful, especially RAWs. Just get a fast card reader. But it is super useful for remote control, which allows for stealth pictures of bird nests, close ups at odd angles, shooting when the camera is mounted in a weird spot, etc. The camera is actually small enough that I can attach it more easily to things with clamps than I could ever have done with an SLR, which allows for some interesting shots. Hero sticks, using ski poles as monopods, gorillapods and the like all work better with this cuz it's small and light. Not so much with a 300mm at one extreme, but definitely true with a smaller lens. Or the lens cap lens, which works surprisingly well. And again you can use that wifi connection and your phone to trigger the camera while viewing what it sees; super cool.It didn't concern me that this isn't weatherproofed. Most lenses aren't anyway. You're probably better off with a case. The card slot/battery hatch is a bit flimsy; it could definitely be stouter. Battery life is fine; there are lots of aftermarket chargers and batteries. My Wasabis have worked fine. Wifi eats it up, so you'll need extras.I do wish it did 60fps video; seems behind my Panasonic in that regard. It's fun in outdoor activities to shoot at that rate and then slow it down. Burst mode is quite acceptable. I have found the autofocus to work fine, but then again I'm not shooting courtside at the NBA playoffs. YMMV.Some might consider the optional grip, ECG-1. It's very well made, but is weighty. Which might be a plus for some. Gives a much sturdier one-handed grip. And a cool feature is that it has a quick release so you can easily just slip off the grip, leaving only a small base and tripod mount, and making the card/battery slot accessible. And it does protect the whole bottom of the camera. Very well made.There are an awful lot of good cameras out there now.

Beauty, function, and technology all rolled into one!", "Author": "C. Pinchon", "ReviewID": "R2R8T4L4IR0PEY", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "First, let me say that this is my first and only mirror less camera and that I am a beginner photographer (only began 1 year ago) when my husband purchased a Canon Rebel SL1/100D (APS-C sensor). Since then, I\u2019ve been studying photography and researching gear, etc.I bought the OMD EM 10 for several reasons:Smaller and lighter and more compact than even the SL1 (Canon\u2019s smallest DSLR in their range, came out in 2013).The buttons and dials are near perfect, making easy to shoot in manual (not very easy with the SL1\u2019s single dial) and a super control panel that allows you to change your settings by tapping the screen and swiveling the dial or using the arrows on the keypad. There are other screens that come up to make quick adjustments too.I wanted an EVF and LCD screen. Both are very bright and come with lots of cool features that even modern DSLRs (sorry, Canon!) don\u2019t have. I can view my highlights in bright red and shadows in blue, I can adjust the highlights and shadows before I even take the shot. I can see my exposure compensation applied to the shot before I take it. Focus peaking and magnifying of the subject to fine tune focus. So cool!The LCD is tilting, but not articulating, and the touch screen feature was really important to me. It allows three settings (tap to focus and take a shot, tap to focus only, and turn off touch screen). I can easily toggle between these settings. Its very touch sensitive and I find myself using the LCD more than the EVF (less squinting in my opinion).Price! At $700 USD, this is pricier than my Canon Rebel SL1, but I felt like it was the right fit for my needs (looking for sharper images, touch screen, family shots, vacation camera, take out and about camera).Fast autofocus. Sharp images. When I tap the screen using Live View on my Canon, it focuses slowly and finally takes the shot (like 1 second goes by). This Olympus is fast\u2026.tap and zap! I love the 81 auto focus points, but I find myself just tapping the screen where I want to focus and it does that. Try doing that with the Canon (it will\u2026just really really slowly and you\u2019ll miss the shot!). I\u2019ve been experimenting on shooting my 5 year old boy and by tapping to focus and shoot, the majority of my images are sharp (though it can\u2019t keep up if my kid moves at warp speed).Image stabilization! I found a lot of my Canon photos to be just slightly blurry\u2014user error, lens error, I don\u2019t know. But with this stabilization, I can see the effect when video recording and when hand holding in dark situations. I did some compare shots with the Canon and I got the first shot using the Olympus sharp, and with the Canon handheld, it took 3-4 shots before I got a usable photo.Love the idea of focus peaking and magnifying, though I am still practicing how to use this feature. I couldn\u2019t get it to work a few times, its most likely user error.Allows various file formats (RAW, Raw + fine JPEG, Raw + Normal JPEG\u2026)Their Olympus app allows you to use the camera\u2019s built in wifi (woohoo!) to upload images, to control the camera in a Live View mode (I used this to get self portraits), only caveat is that to upload photos to your phone, you have to shoot JPEGs (RAW files won\u2019t be able to be uploaded). I discovered this issue after some trial and error. The app worked right away though it took me a few tries to get the hang of it. You turn the WiFi on the camera, then go to your settings on your phone (I have iPhone) and connect to the WiFi of the camera, then exit, then open the Olympus app. If you try to use the camera (like to play the last photo or take a shot) while the WiFi is on, it turns off the WiFi connection. Even in their app, I can tap the screen to focus and take the shot (95% of my images came out pin sharp. I did the same test on my canon with an equivalent lens and with a remote trigger and only like 70% of my shots came out sharp).Cons:I\u2019ve been playing around with the options and discovered the WB feature has a \u201ckeep warm tones warm\u201d or something like that. Turn that off. I was taking pics of my son playing in the bath and he was golden, and the white tiles were yellowish. Much better when I removed this feature.On/off switch is stuck on the back lower right corner. So I was not turning it off, and accidentally taking photos when the camera was bouncing around.So many customizable features\u2026a bit daunting (I don\u2019t know what some of it means) but I got the settings to where I want them and played with some of the more advanced features. Download the PDF manual and read that. The paper manual that comes in the box has bare minimum information. There are articles and YouTube videos to help explain some of these features.Lenses: I bought the tiny pancake zoom M. Zuiko 14-42 mm 3.5-5.6 EZ MSC power zoom (instead of the kit lens) for its compact size. I plan on using this for movies and shots where I need the zoom feature.The new 25mm 1.8 Olympus lens with hood. Just got it yesterday and together, my images are PIN sharp. I am super impressed.Overall impression: very pleased with this purchase and I have no reservations about it at all. I am impressed by the bokeh I am getting using the 25mm 1.8 lens because I didn\u2019t expect much from a micro 4/3 sensor. Highly recommend this camera for its style, customizability, totally cool digital features (focus peaking, magnifying, immediate view of your adjustments before you take the shot, and WiFi connectivity).", "Date": "May 3, 2014"}, {"Title": "Glad I waited on the E-M5", "Author": "bop800", "ReviewID": "R26DRQZS2O2RBD", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "When the E-M5 came out I read the rave reviews, but waited because of the (relatively) high cost.  I'm glad I waited.I picked up an E-PL5 when it was released because it used the same E-M10 sensor at a substantially lower cost.  It was my go-to camera for many events.  I loved the portability and was thrilled with the vaunted Olympus colors.I also own a Panny G6 and GX1, both of which have given me superb results.The M10 has pretty much shelved my PL5 and G6 and regulated the GX1 to travel cam status.The M43 sensor may not quite keep up with the full frame cameras, particularly in low light, but for an amateur enthusiast like myself it has not been an issue.  Shooting primarily with primes is a big reason for this.  The Oly 75mm on this camera is simply amazing.E-M10 PROs- CONTROL DIALS - Superb when shooting manually.  Big improvement over my other cameras.- Oly colors- Focus peaking - When shooting with vintage lenses, this is a must-have- Compact size.  If you want a beefier grip, pick up the ECG-1 accessory.- Many people disagree with me, but I much prefer the Oly up/down display vs. the swing out 180 degree display.  I've owned both and the E-M5 (and PL5) display is much more convenient.- Built in flash with wireless flash control (although I haven't tried it yet)WiFi - Convenient for remote shooting with my Nexus tablet.E-M10 CONs- Generally inferior video to my GX1 and G6.  Not an issue for me since I shoot almost all stills.- Not weather sealed - Not a big issue for me, I have a tough camera for inclement weather- Image stabilization makes slight whirring sound.  I've heard others complain, but the one time I shot video the stabilization was superb as I panned the shot.- No electronic shutter.  A nice feature on my G6.If you don't care about weather sealing, skip the M5 and have a hard look at the M10.", "Date": "April 7, 2014"}, {"Title": "A Pocket Hercules", "Author": "Neutral grey", "ReviewID": "R255AYFUG2LKMX", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "This is one amazing piece of engineering.  I used to use a Nikon D7100 for serious shooting, Fuji X-10 to carry everywhere, and an IPhone 5S in a pinch.  I was looking for something more portable than the D7100 and with more creative control than the X-10.  I nearly bought the Fuji X-T1 but when I learned that it was difficult to control the focus points, that was ruled out.  I was hesitant to go with any micro 4/3 until the EM-10 came out.  Since purchasing this I have not had the desire to use the D7100 or the X-10 and rarely use the IPhone.  Below are the pros and cons. It gets four stars rather than five only because of performance in sports and action photography was not on par with a DSLR, but their was a firmware upgrade in May 2014 and by setting \"Release Lag-Time\" to \"short\" it works much better for sport and I may upgrade my review to a 5 star later.Pros:1) Small size:  the camera is so incredibly small yet so usable.  It is actually smaller than the X-10. It's like having a miniature DSLR in your pocket.  It easily fits in your coat pocket or suit jacket pocket with the power zoom lens.  All the lenses are very small and can fit in your coat pocket.2) Design: The controls and menu system is great.  I never could get use to the controls on the D7100 and the controls on the EM-10 are so intuitive and user friendly. I mainly shoot full manual and I can quickly control aperture and shutter speed with the command dials and access the ISO and white balance to control with the two command dials.  It also has auto ISO in full manual which is great.3) Focus points: There are 81 focus points throughout the screen that are easily controlled by the directional dial. Whenever you press the direction dial it will control the direction of the focus point.  Nothing else needs to be done. I know of no other camera that has this feature or that can control focus point so easily.  That is reason alone to purchase this cameral for me. The D7100 had 51 focus point that were all bunched up in the center.4) Electronic view finder (EVF):  If you have never tried an EVF, please do so. After using an EVF, I could never go back to an optical view finder (OVF).  The image quality is so much better, bigger and brighter then with D7100 OVF.  What you see is what you get. The exposure and white balance changes that you make are reflected in the EVF.  There is no guesswork in the exposure.  You rarely have to rely in the light meter.  You can also play back photos in the EVF. Even in the brightest outdoor lighting you can playback the photos in the EVF.5) The tilting touch screen:  This feature is to die for.  No longer do you have to lie on the ground to get a creative shot.  You flip out the touch screen and tap the screen with your finger where you want the photo to focus and be exposed.  While I prefer to use the EVF when possible, this really comes in handy for the hard to get shots. The focus is also blazing fast.6) Video with image capture:  DSLR's are terrible for video.  The live view is awful and the autofocus is noisy.  Not with this camera.  The focus is spot on and totally silent. Best of all, you can do completely silent image capture while recording video.  No longer do you have to choose between video and photo.  You can snap away during video and nail great pictures very fast.7) Easy access to advanced features:  Custom white balance, HDR, bracketing and multiple exposure are so easy to use and much better than the D7100. It would take to long to explain each one. For custom white balance, you just point it a white sheet of patient, snap a picture and your done.  You now have perfect white balance during difficult lighting.8) Low light performance: In my opinion this camera is superior in low light to the APS-C D7100.  As far as I am concerned, it is very good up to ISO 6,400 and totally usable up to 10,000.  Most reviews would disagree with me, but unless you are pixel peeping and cropping, that's been my experience.9) Auto focus:  The singe auto focus is blazing fast and accurate.10)  Menus system: While not necessarily intuitive, it is logical, easy to use, easy to learn and easy to access.  The manual is good.11)  Built in image stabilization: It works12)  Lenses: Multiple great lenses to choose from. Excellent fast prime lenses. The 14 - 42 mm pancake power zoom with built in lens cap is so incredibly convenient.  You have to see it to believe it.13)  Image quality: With the prime lenses the image quality is equal to or better than the D7100.  With the kit lenses the image quality is good, but not on par with the D7100 using my Tamron 28 - 75/f2.8 and 70 - 300 mm. Not a fair comparison though.14) JPEGS:  The JPEGs are so good that you hardly need any post-processing.15) Manual focus peeking:  I rarely use it, but it is a nice feature.16) Small lens diameter: Because the lenses are so small you can shoot through a chain fence at a little league baseball game.17) Design: I like the retro DSLR look and feel.Cons:1) Continuous auto-focus and auto-focus tracking: READ THIS CAREFULLY.  This camera does not focus in the same way as a DSLR.  Contrast detection is different from phase detection.  This is important when it comes shooting sports or children playing. Faces do not have a lot of contrast and if you focus on a face of children playing the camera may focus on the background.  This is not important with portrait photography, but with people at a distance it is a real problem.  There is a way around this, though.  You have to pick the smallest focus point. Go to the focus point menu. At the bottom left of the screen you can control focus point size and face detection. Select the smallest focus point size, the camera DOES NOT come set this way and you won't easily find it in the manual. Also select the large superfine JPEG (check the manual). You have to go into the menu system to do this.  Most important, focus on shirts and not faces.  Shirts have a lot more contrast and you will get better results.a. The autofocus tracking works, but is unreliable.  Nowhere on par with a DSLR. Best avoid using it if possible. Don't believe the Youtube tests. Yes, the autofocus tracking will work great on a brightly colored motorcyle circling on a dirt track. It will not work for a small child running around a cluttered playground.b. The continuous autofocus works pretty well, but you can't see the focus point in the screen when taking multiple shots at either 3 FPS or 8 FPS.  With the D7100 the focus point were always lit up red, in the EM-10 it lights up green once and not again.  The focus point is otherwise so faint you really cant see where it is.  You have to just put it in the center of the screen for action and keep the subject in the center of the screen.c. For fast moving sports there was a noticeable delay between what you see and what is actually occurring until the May 2014 firmware update and by setting the \"Release Lag-Time\" to \"short\".2) Does not have quiet or silent mode for photography.  The shutter release is little loud, so less than ideal for street photography.Conclusions:  Amazing camera, small and convenient, great low light performance, image quality on par with a DSLR, excellent controls and functionality, attractive design, great lenses. Did not initially excel at sports and action photography but with a recent firmware upgrade and setting the \"Release Lag-Time\" to \"short\", focus speed is now outsanding may exceed a DSLR.", "Date": "May 25, 2014"}, {"Title": "Excellent", "Author": "Stephen Ingraham \"lightshedder\"", "ReviewID": "R2ZVDFYSJITCYU", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I bought into the OM-D system for the 75-300mm zoom as a compact wildlife outfit.

I came from an Olympus E30 (With a sizable investment in Lenses) to this and I'm pretty happy so far.  I consider myself a DSLR hold-out.In spite of its size, I found this camera to be very DSLR like in operation I was pretty comfortable with it in about five minutes.  I got used to the EVF very easily as well.  This EVF makes manual focusing in dim light very easy. There are 2 individually controlled software based focusing aids that work pretty well.  The first is an image magnifier so you can really look at your focusing target as you move the focus collar on the lens.  And the second is something called focus peaking, which is a clever control that puts a sort of a 'halo' around the objects in the viewfinder.  The size and thickness of the halo tells you  how well in focus the objects are.  The thicker the 'halo' the more in focus it is.  In daylight, I don't think the two focusing aids are needed, i had no trouble focusing without help, so I turned them off to save power.  Why waste it when you don't need it?There is also one of those red focusing lamps to help with auto focus in dim light, but the size of the camera makes it difficult for me to hold the body in a way that doesn't interfere with the lamp.  I can do it, but the grip in that case is kind of awkward.  But in most situations that is not an issue.But the REALLY good news is that with the proper adapter, my Olympus DSLR lenses work in full auto mode and they aren't too slow in operation.  The adapter IS kind of an expensive extra, but it is nothing if you have a sizable investment in still good lenses.  My DSLR 9-18 mm super-wide angle zoom (roughly equivalent to 18 - 36 mm in 35 mm film cameras) works as quickly as the m4/3s lens.  The sales clerk in the shop I bought it from and I tested it against an m4/3s 9-18 zoom and neither of us could tell the difference in speed. I look forward to using this with abandon!The older 14 - 54 'normal' zoom (28-108 mm for 35 mm) and the 40 - 150 mm Tele zoom (80-300mm for 35 mm) being of an older generation focused much slower, but I would judge them acceptable in full auto mode for landscapes, portraits, still life, and architecture shots in bright light.  However, the superior manual focus capability of the camera means that manual focus is probably going to be faster (or as fast) and dead on accurate.  I'm thinking no auto focus can be as good as manual focus, so I have set up a function button to switch to manual focus with a single press of the button.For those serious shooters who like to know these things, I have discovered that the images tend to be over exposed by + .5 EV, so I have set the camera up to UNDEREXPOSE by -.5 EV for best results. To the NON photo GEEKS, don't let this worry you. this camera will provide you with wonderful photos straight out of the box.  This is an arcane and obscure fact of interest to the truly obsessed.  Image quality is superb, as good as my E30 DSLR was, the E-M10 is clearly superior.The user's manual (on disk, with an abbreviated paper version in the box) is dreadful.  Not up to the standards of the manual that came with my E30.  The thing is usable, but be prepared to really READ the thing when you need information.  The organization isn't good enough to skim through it to find the info you need.  But you can probably get all the help you need by going to a photo enthusiasts site like Digital Photography Review and asking questions in the forums, oddly, DPR is now owned by Amazon, go figure.On the whole, I'm very happy with this purchase.

The manuel that come in the box is a condensed version so you have to load the long version from the CD. It is not the most user friendly menu however. I am forever trying to figure out how to get back to the place I want to go. I wish it were more intuitive in that way. I am also having a hard time with the touch screen. I can get it to focus from the screen and take pictures but I can't figure out how to slide the f-stop/shutter and ISO from the touch screen. I have to use the dials to change everything but I'm pretty sure I saw a video once where the person was using his finger to change the settings on the screen. Not sure if it's not working properly or if I have to get into another menu to change something. I took some pictures of some deer today in a forest preserve and they came out great.

I liked what I saw in the Olympus Om D  4/3 cameras, but I was reluctant to pay the over $1000 for the M5. When the M10 came out, I decided that the price was low enough to try getting into M 4/3, and if I didn't like it I did not have a lot of money in it. The M10 turns out to be a great camera, pretty much everything I need at near half the price of the Oly M1, and is lighter as well. I don't think that the waterproof feature of the M1 is worth the extra money, as I don't take pictures in wet conditions.The image quality is great, the camera controls can be customized to suit individual taste, and it is fast to focus. The electronic viewfinder is a great plus, as you can actually see exposure and white balance adjustments before you take a picture. The grip is recommended, though if you really want to save weight the camera is OK without it. Adown side is the small battery, and for my use it lacks capacity, so I quickly bought two spares. The charger is bulky and uses a cord, unlike like Nikon which comes with a cord and a small plug adapter.

Now if you read through the other reviews you hear that the images are as every bit as good as full frame camera.. i.e ones costing $3000 - 4000. Ok if I was buying that much camera I would expect that I would expect some improvement but your not looking to spend that kind of money and your not looking to put up your images on a Bill board. But get this I took a picture of my bed side table under ambient light had held, and then zoomed in on the finished image 100 times and I could read a stamp that was on the stem.  The definition is amazing.  The LCD screen in bright, and it articulated for ease of viewing, it has wi if. So you can send pictures to friends from camera, and it allows remote shooting. It has a bunch of art filters, that are fun, you can take time lapse movies, night shots are possible on a tripod and you can literally watch the image build up on the screen.  It has in camera HDR, It can bracket, it shoots in RAW and jpg at the same time, and if you tap the screen it will focus on that spot and then take a picture.  It is the most fun I have ever had with a camera. And I am only scratching the surface . Oh get this , I am using lenses that I bought 20 years ago, with a 20.00 adapter.  I have an adaptor for my FTB cannon lenses and one for my old manual Nikon lenses. You can't go wrong.  And yes it is small, they sell a cool larger grip.  Makes the camera really to easy to hold one hand.  Oh yeah .. On camera flash too....I could go on...

Not its size as much as its \"reality\". My adjustment to this camera is more philosophical than technical (although the menus system as we all know is a rabbit hole), it seems real, it performs, yet I continue to give  and think of it as a point and shoot, which it is not. This new \"feel\", its size, small, its weight, light... I am learning to take it seriously... time will tell... Due to its diminutive size, it went unnoticed sitting on the bar as I exited. To clarify for those that do not get it.. this was not a technical review.. There are plenty here... I'm  learning to love a very small light weight camera that offered much of what my larger DSLR offered. The photos are excellent. The WiFi works flawlessly with my iPhone and its pretty quick...

I'm a Panasonic user (LX5, GF1, GX1, G2 and GH2), but not a fan boy and wanted to use the Oly 12-40mm with the stabilization.  So I bought my first Olympus, the E-M10 because he has a built-in flash. Got it yesterday, returned today. Why ?When the IS is ON, you're waiting for shooting, you will hear a very annoying humming sound. I didn't read that in the previous reviews. Maybe I got a lemon ? That's why a three stars neutral review.I wanted to \"love\" this beautiful camera but:- It's too small for my large hands, (the GH2 is the perfect size to me).- When I compare this Oly menu vs the Pannies menus, I remember Windows 98 vs OS.9.- I'm almost sure that the battery/card door will break in the next 6 months (same flimsy construction on my 1986 Canon AE-1P)I can't (and don't want to) review the image quality but bad m4/3 cameras simply don't exist in 2014.And of course there is a good video mode, even the stupid fanboy below said the contrary.I will wait for a G7 with in-body stab and focus-peaking.Pierre", "Date": "February 13, 2014"}, {"Title": "Don't Understand the Hype, Panasonic GX7 better in many ways.", "Author": "Jholmes", "ReviewID": "R1FDDMJUW7TQ3C", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "I have been using Panasonic M 4/3 for 4 years now as well as Sony NEX's and decided to try the OMD EM10 since it is a reasonable price (but I like the Body Style of the EM1 better, but its way overpriced).- Menu System is in small text and a little confusing. The Panasonic Menus are simplified and much better organized and there are almost as many settings.- This camera is built fairly well its a little lighter and a little smaller than the GX7, maybe even a little too small, and the Shutter Release button is not as good. The LCD screen on the EM10 and Viewfinder are not as bright as the GX7's but very decent. The Battery Door is not as solid and the Card slot is too tight and the card release mechanism is not as good.- The Picture Quality and Autofocus is about the same in daylight, but testing both, I give the edge to the GX7 as it is sharper, especially in low light with the Panny 20mm F1.7. The GX7 has much better low light focus as well as picture quality. The EM10 like some of the NEX's tends to get smudgy at high ISOs. Panasonic's Metering and White Balance are also much more accurate.- The WiFi works slightly better than the Panasonic G6 and GX7, but I don't use it much.- Video..what video ?  Panasonic shine in this area by leaps and bounds. Even the G6 Video blows away the Olympus attempt and Video - very disappointing.- Battery life is about the same as the GX7.- The IBIS on this OMD is 3-axis (as opposed to 5 on the EM5/EM1) and it is as effective as the GX7's which has 2. However, the EM10 has IBIS during Video which is a welcome feature, but the video quality is not worth using.- The Panasonic G6/GX7 Time Lapse, Stop motion work beautifully and have more options and can create great videos over the EM10. Again, the video is not worth using on the EM10 as it only has 30p.The overall build quality, user experience and picture quality of the GX7 is better than the EM10. The GX7 is ~729.00 and the EM10 is ~699.00 - so I would definitely recommend the Panasonic over the Olympus..", "Date": "February 7, 2014"}, {"Title": "Wifi connection does not work", "Author": "Cisco H.
