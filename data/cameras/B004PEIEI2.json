The pictures it took were horrible.  Indoors, outdoors, flash on, flash off...  all the pictures were blurry or grainy.  I returned it to Best Buy where I had paid 29.99 for it.  Surprised that Best Buy would sell such junk.  Save your money or spend a little more for a better camera.", "Date": "December 24, 2011"}, {"Title": "SUCKS SO BAD, EVEN AS A GIFT FOR A 3-YR-OLD!!", "Author": "Lotus flower mama \"Lotus flower mama\"", "ReviewID": "RDRC73BIRQRNA", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "Bought this for my 3-yr-old daughter for Christmas, since she's always taking my more-expensive Canon, and I figured this would keep her away from it. Well, you'd think 5.1 MP would be pretty damn good, since it was only a few years ago that 4 MP was the most expensive (okay, maybe 9-10 years ago, but still...the pictures were GOOD!). But, as the previous reviewer wrote, no matter where or how you take pictures, they're GRAINY, and the flash is WAY too bright, washing everything out! It looks like you took the pictures with a REALLY old instant camera, maybe way back from the  1960s or something! Yes, you can see what's in the pictures, but they still really SUCK! MAYBE a decent toy for a 3-yr-old, since I doubt she cares about picture quality, but, first, I'm surprised a Vivitar camera SUCKS this bad, and  second, her Fisher-Price kids' camera actually takes pictures that are pretty much the SAME quality as this!! DON'T BUY UNLESS YOU'RE GIVING THIS AS A CHEAP TOY TO A KID!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!", "Date": "December 31, 2011"}, {"Title": "Travel camera", "Author": "Michele McKenzie-Jones", "ReviewID": "R1BFUKJLYDYVJU", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "The price was perfect for my 14 year old.
