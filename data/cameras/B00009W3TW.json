I doubt you could put a heavy video camera or spotting scope on it, especially with the extensions extended.  Its probably best for digital cameras and small digital web cams etc.", "Date": "September 15, 2009"}, {"Title": "love it!", "Author": "April", "ReviewID": "R1H5CEOBNRX2TK", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "This is an excellent little table-top tripod to have. I have a Nikon D5000 and it works with no problems. Unlike a cheap plastic tripod that would fall over, this little guy is built heavy with rubberized feet to stabilize it. The rotating ball joint can't be screwed very tightly, though; you can still rotate the ball joint even when you do tighten it, however it doesn't fall over with the weight of the camera, so it doesn't matter much.A must have.", "Date": "June 26, 2010"}, {"Title": "Great Quality", "Author": "J.

That's what I was looking for. I needed to replace an old one that broke and used it each time I went out and a good photo posibility existed. Really light and easy to carry.I like that you can tilt the head for vertical pictures.But the one I received is a bit different than advertized. It said Operational height range: 5 5/8\" to 12\", Extended Height: 9.75-inch, Minimum Height: 2.75-inch. But really the range goes from 5.50\" to 7.50\" when legs are closed, when opened it's a little bit shorter. In the picture you can see the legs spread wide open, but in reality it doesn't. I haven't use it yet, but gives you the feeling it won't be stable once you put the weight of you camera on, specially on different types of surfaces or terrain if it's windy outside.", "Date": "December 31, 2012"}, {"Title": "Bait and Switch", "Author": "dwc", "ReviewID": "R3NXWW9A1P4A94", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I have a Sunpak 2003 it is a great little tripod for a point and shoot camera.

It weighs 155 grams, yet it plenty strong to hold my 215 gram (7.6 ounce) camera. The legs slide with a good amount of friction, and have a spring-ball to lock them in place. I got it in a light gold color. Although this was never meant to hold heavy items, it is not flimsy at all.", "Date": "January 12, 2010"}, {"Title": "Looks good but poorly built", "Author": "Richard Gray", "ReviewID": "R3H25ZPR48W7V6", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "Ordered 2 of these, one for myself and one as a gift.  Coming out of the package they looked good and felt pretty hefty.  But both units had problems with the ball joint, which is about the most important component.  It appears as though the manufacturing tolerances are way off spec.  There's no way that one can get a smooth and easy way to align or re-align your camera.  It feels like the ball is pivoting against rough and uneven surfaces.  I put a little oil on the joint but that didn't help.  I suppose this is a classic case of getting what you pay for,  I will return these and fork over a bit more for replacements.  Don't waste your money on these.", "Date": "January 31, 2014"}, {"Title": "Great tool for the iphone movie maker!", "Author": "K.

It feels good and is sturdy, but the mechanism for holding the camera in place is a complete failure.
