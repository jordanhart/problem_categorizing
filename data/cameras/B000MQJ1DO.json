I wrote them that I was missing one of the 3 lens filters that was supposed to be included and asked if they could send it separately. No response. They sent me two generic e-mails saying they hoped I was enjoying my kit, but no direct response to two e-mails regarding the filter. Like asking help from an automated recording.Given that all key items were in the kit and in good shape, the filter was a minor thing as far as I was concerned so I let it go. But I'll keep this experience in mind next time I'm considering getting a lens or kit.", "Date": "October 31, 2013"}, {"Title": "I'm in love with my new lens!", "Author": "Cristina Sempere \"in the middle of the world\"", "ReviewID": "R13NZHX0QWZFD1", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This telephoto lens is perfect for taking pictures from a long distance. The focus is great! I use it on my Canon T4i and it is so quiet I can also make videos without having the auto focus sound or even having to wait for it to focus. The only thing I didn't like about it is that every time I want to take a picture from an object near me I have to change de lens to the original one.Also the protective cap holder came apart so I had to glue it back on. Everything else is perfect.", "Date": "January 6, 2014"}, {"Title": "Cheap and nice", "Author": "Miro \"miro\"", "ReviewID": "R29183GKF0AHA7", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I bought this lense to supplement my existing collection of EF and EF-S lenses. For the price it is great. Don't expect miracles.
