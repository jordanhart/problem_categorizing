Sterba", "ReviewID": "R2LU7TMBW237KP", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I bought one of these to connect to a new averdigi card I purchased for my computer.  To be honest, the motivation was that it had a Sony image sensor a good number of IR led's and one of the lowest prices I've seen.  So far this camera has been excellent.  It's not the sharpest resolution, and certainly doesn't compare to what you would get for a lot more money, but for a simple camera it's great.The picture quality both day and night is good, body and mount are solid.  You can see the IR LED's at night (faint red glow), but nothing obvious or distracting.  I wish the mount had a little more movement, but you can make it do what you want for the most part.The 3.6mm lens gives a nice wide view, even at close distances, excellent for an entry, which is what I'm using this one for.So far it's been a good camera that I would recommend, and will personally be buying at least a couple more of.", "Date": "December 19, 2010"}, {"Title": "Ok", "Author": "JJ", "ReviewID": "R3GUNWKYSQLR2D", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "Video quality is avg.

The original system was sold with only 4 cameras, by design. I purchased an additional three low profile under eve mount for the front of the house. You would not notice them in the daytime unless you are looking for them. At night, the infrared glows as a warning to anyone that needs to be warned. (My wife likes it that way). The final camera for the system is the VideoSecu above. This is a rather large outdoor camera (3X) as compared to the original Defender cameras. It appears sturdy and well made. The optics are as good as the original cameras with a wider field of view. The night performance is as good as most quality night (B&W;) cameras.The camera mount is very sturdy. The price with free shipping is very attractive. The VideoSecu cable is of better quality than most.  The only reason I did not give this five star is that focal is not adjustable. This however is nit picking, as this camera is not advertized as an adjustable focal length camera. VideoSecu will sell you one, if you need this feature.", "Date": "March 3, 2011"}, {"Title": "Good Image- Well Built", "Author": "Ben", "ReviewID": "R2W54H8V1AXVAQ", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Initially I purchased ne of these cameras to use to monitor my house entrance.

I see someone reviewed this camera and gave it two stars complaining about resolution.  It's resolution is 420.  I was very pleased with the quality of the image.  I'm using my cameras on the exterior of my home.  The picture quality in daylight and nighttime is good.  I have several other 420 line cameras, and the image on this camera is the best of all of the ones I own.  Although I didn't need a mount, the mount which was included is a good quality mount.  I'll be ordering another one of these today to replace my other bad camera.I've purchased from Videosecu in the past, and even spoke with them on the phone a couple of years ago when they were doing business on Ebay, and they're customer service has always been excellent.", "Date": "February 6, 2011"}, {"Title": "GREAT F.L.I.R.

This camera blows the old camera away.  Something to note is that these cameras are not like camcorders or webcams so you can't expect HD quality or anything.  This camera has great color and easily lights up my front yard at night.  One of the things I like about this camera is that the infrared lights do not just come on full blast as its getting dark outside.  The darker it gets, the brighter the infrared lights become so that you get a nice progression on the video.  The camera over all feels very sturdy and well built.  I am considering buying another of these to add to my security system soon.Another thing to note about this camera is that the infrared LED's are the cheaper ones that put off a very very dim pink glow.  Some people like it because its a good warning to anyone who is sneaking around that they had better back off and that is probably better than having to deal with whatever they were planning on doing.  I hope to see more people include whether this glow is present or not in their reviews of other cameras.", "Date": "June 26, 2011"}, {"Title": "Spice up the bedroom", "Author": "bahhhoo \"bahhhoo\"", "ReviewID": "R3HPEX1PI9CD2", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "This is an update 3/1/12.

The image is noticeably sharper (not crystal clear, but about as good as one can expect for the type of camera and price) and the transition to night mode is gradual and smooth.

The pictures are grainy and would not be of any value in a retail area to distinguish items on a shelf, especially if something ends up missing.I am assuming they are only about 420 lines of resolution, or less, but like I said, I still can not find enough info on them to know for sure.

The mount was easy to adjust and the camera has a large field of view with great night vision range. It seems to be much better at motion detection than some other cameras I've used. It definitely is a big step above the 1/4\" CCD cameras. The only issue I've had, and I think this applies to all cameras of this type, as other brands of cameras I've used have had the same issue, is it doesn't react so well to bright lights, like motion detection security lighting directly visible in the field of view. I think it's much better if your security lighting acts as back lighting to the camera.
