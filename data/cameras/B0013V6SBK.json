It is not a great camera for outdoors.

These do color reasonably well, but color is a waste of system resources. They are providing excellent results (reasonably sharp image) during daylight hours. However, \"unaided\" night vision is severely limited and grainy. With the \"aid\" of extra outside lighting, however; they are plenty adequate. Facial features are easily recognizable up to 30 feet during the day, although \"license plate\" recognition will not be possible with these cameras. These cameras are fairly small and are easy to install. They come with a power cube. Video and power is contained in one cable. I had to cut the cable from the camera during installations to past the cable \"through-the-wall, otherwise a fairly large hole would be required to pass the video and power connectors. Cutting the cable enabled only a 3/16th hole versus a 1/2in or larger, otherwise. I use these as outside cameras and have crafted a tin shield to keep the weather off them. I have had NO issues with condensation or moisture during adverse or wet weather operations. If you need good night time illumination during operations, these are NOT your cameras. You would be better off spending a few more dollars and purchase cameras with 30 or more IR LEDS. However, if you have supplemental lighting during night operations, these cameras work well. These cameras do have a few IR LEDs, but realistically, are barely useful for anything other than catching critters flying in front of the lens, maximum of 5-10ft distance at their very best. This camera NEEDS good interior/exterior lighting to function well.2/18/2013After two years since my last comments on the GE 45231 video camera, I felt I should add a few more comments regarding my experiences with it. I still have the original GE45231 cameras running on my Zoneminder camera system and they are doing exceptionally well to this day. I must confirm that the camera works far better if used in conjunction with some outside lighting source such as a security light. I have purchased several \"very\" expensive $150+ cameras with 30 or more LEDs. The problem is that the expensive cameras are \"far\" more sensitive and pick up minute bugs, dust and fog causing excessive false imagery. I have found the back lighted GE 45231 to be far superior in night time operations. Daytime operation has never been an issue. Moral of the story is, if you desire minute detail, then the GE 45231 is not your camera. If, however you wish general video monitoring, the GE 45231 does an exceptionally good job. Yesterday, I purchased two more GE 45231 cameras from Amazon to replace two cameras I burned up due to experimentation.( grin ). I discovered they are \"very\" sensitive to voltage spikes.", "Date": "April 17, 2011"}, {"Title": "Better Than I Expected...", "Author": "C. Weaver", "ReviewID": "R3FNBIN96RXFBW", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I used to have a security camera system that had a small 7\" B/W monitor and a camera so I wasn't expecting to much from this camera at first. Well, I was very pleasently surprised. I have a front porch that has a good protected area on it and I wanted a camera that would face toward the drive and street I live on as the trailer I live at has a front door that faces away from my street. Installation wasn't to bad. I ran into one small problem as the instruction book indicated that there were a template included as to where to place the holes to mount the camera base on, but I couldn't find one included as mentioned in the instructions. This was solved by taking a piece of paper and placing the camera base on it and trancing the outline of the base on it and then lifting it up and carefully punching two holes where the screw mount holes narrowed down. After this it was a matter of drilling two small holes with my drill and driving home the screws. The camera's base allows setting the camera in any position you need even upside down if you need to. Running the cable wasn't that hard. I suggest that you don't plug in the 60 foot cable before you need to. Since the 60 foot cable contains A/V and power your not limited to where you place the power supply and it can be at the end of the cable. I ran my cable from the front porch to the Computer Room which is at the front of my trailer about 50 feet from where the camera was. I had more than enough cable for this. I plugged it into a VCR I had and when I plugged it in, the camera worked the first time withj no problems. The picture is much better than the old camera I used to have and the audio is good too. I did noticed a very small amount of hum on the audio but it wasn't all that bad. I have a small night light on my front porch and it seemed to help the picture at night. I also noted and when a car turns in to my street at night,  the color comes back on for just a second when the light reaches the porch from the road so it seems to adjust well to changing light conditions. To this time, I can little to complain about and it seems to work fine and without any problems so far. I'm glad I got this.Update 9/24/13: I'm more impressed now than at first. One of these cameras that I have is in a really hostile location. It's subjected to water, rough treatment at times (A raccoon tried to eat it!) and if it was going to fail it should have by now. To make a long story short I thought it had two days ago. I noted the picture from it flicking and after about a day it went out, so after I noted the camera felt cold to the touch, (They run a bit warm when working.) I decided I'd lost a camera. After ordering another replacement, I was pulling the old camera's cable out and found a small area where a squirrel had chewed thru the cable! After replacing the cable, the camera was as good as new! So after everything this one camera as been thru, a chewing squirrel cutting the cable was what caused the camera to go down and NOT a camera failure. One of the best buys I've made and I ordered another for a spare!!! Well, made!", "Date": "April 24, 2013"}, {"Title": "wide angle view with mid-range quality-Great Value", "Author": "Matthew Miller", "ReviewID": "R3KHLLRLJQVY8O", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "this was an upgrade from one of those $20 pinhole style indoor cameras.  This camera offers an improvement in night vision, a bit better resolution, and a wider angle.  I use it indoors.  it is mounted on a far wall in a dining room that looks into a living room and towards a front door.  The closer room (dining room has about 75% room coverage, and the room it looks into (living room, gives about 90% coverage.  The closer room has really good detail, but due to the wide angle, the further room is visible, but lacks enough resolution to see everything real sharp.. I can see my cat moving around in further room (about 30' away) but if it is curled up on couch, I have to really look at the image to realize that.  -For $35 however, this thing is fantastic.I will see if I can upload an image from my camera to the 'customer images' on the product description.It has AUDIO, however I have not actually listened to it to verify quality.The Provided cable is essentially an S-Video cable style cord, so on the end of the Camera there is short cord with what looks like a male S-video end.  Then in the box, it provides a short adapter that takes that S-video end, and splits it into 3 wires; Powercable, Audio, and Video.*** Note, my unit was provided with the incorrect Power adapter..  It is a 9Volt power supply, however the adapter had an incorrect end, and was much too small to fit into the power plug on the cord.  I ended up splicing the power cord end from the old camera that this replaced.  -The box I received from Amazon had some tape on part of the box, so it is possible that the unit I received was used/returned previously.", "Date": "January 8, 2014"}, {"Title": "great little camera", "Author": "elguapoviejo", "ReviewID": "RAB7NGS7IKE4P", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "cute little camerea, really works great.

The wireless is not bad but has problem loosing signal too much. This particular model I have used it without a DVR card direct into my Graphic card's Video input port and also use it as webcam. It is much better than any webcam on the market in its picture quality. Night Vision is not bad at all for 9 leds.  Does a great job , very sturdy and not easy to break. Works great with 3rd party softwares Power VCR , PYE and many more. NO Drivers needed. GE like always is hard to beat even for its simple things like this cam. I use AGP 64 bit NVidea graphic card. If you have a better Graphic card I am sure your results will top.  This little cam will do a lot with almost any software if you got a VIDEO IN ( RCA TYPE) in your PC , independant card or integrated in graphic card whichever it is. It will work without asking for drivers. XP/2000/98 and Vista 32-64 bit both. I checked it on all these Platforms. Bravo !
