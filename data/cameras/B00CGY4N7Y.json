It looks pocketable, and under most normal circumstances it is pocketable. The camera is light and fits nicely into the front pockets of my Express shorts and producer pants. The pocket-bulge is nearly identical to an iPhone fitted with an Otterbox case. On the other hand, you can go ahead and toss away any conjured fantasies of stuffing it into a pair of 511s though. It won't happen. I've already tried. Ergonomically, the GR feels great in the hand. The grip is sort of sticky (in a good a way), so it adheres nicely to my palm & fingers; making it perfect for comfortably long shoots.One of the most important things while taking photos is limiting the barrier between you and your subject as you snap the shutter. The less a camera is in your way, the better. Luckily for the GR, it's quite simple to assign and change up the functions to suit any particular style of workflow so it gets out your way immediately. It's somewhat reminiscent of the OM-D. It may take a day or two to find the most intuitive button layout that suits you, but once you've found it, you'll probably never have to touch it again. (As an aside, if I could add one feature to the menu, it would be the ability to shoot RAW alongside small or x-small jpegs. Currently the camera can only save RAW photos alongside large JPEGS.) In action, I find the GR snappy and stealthy; buffer speeds are quick, focusing is lighnting fast in adequate lighting, and the shutter is barely audible. It's not all chocolates and roses though. Despite being accurate, the focus is slow in low-light; the latter being a room with one or two lamps on. In the aforementioned shooting scenarios, the camera sometimes takes between 1.5-2 seconds before it locks. But once you're accustomed to the snap-focus feature and prejudging distances, it's not that big of a problem.If you're in the market for this camera, you know you're in it for the large-sensor photos. Heading over to Flickr and browsing the real-life samples will probably give you a better indicator of the IQ than what I can put into words. To put it simply, the GR's sensor/lens combination is one of the sharpest kits I've ever used; even wide open. (Much sharper than my old X100.) The photos have a nice `pop' to them that I find tough to achieve with the Panasonic 14mm. ISO looks clean up to 3200; with noticeable noise kicking in at 6400. Keep an eye on the white-balance though. It strays from the norm every once in a while, more so than my m43 cameras. But if you're shooting RAW it's easily correctable in-camera. And for bokeh lovers, I'll be upfront. At 28mm, this is not a bokeh machine. You can isolate subjects, but the f/2.8 lens is best suited for contextual shooting. I prefer compositions with backgrounds and context while shooting 28mm anyways, so this is no issue to me. Having video at the flip of a switch is nice too. However, I wish I could have some kind of basic control over the shutter speed while recording in order to smooth out the motion cadence a bit.Before you purchase the camera, please be aware of its limitations. The GR will not suit everyone; especially at its current price. But for its target market, it's almost everything one could ask for. Luckily, I am that targeted market. And while f/2.8 is adequate, the GR does not substitute my Panasonic 20mm combined with Olympus' stabilization. But if you're okay with the limitations & you must have DSLR-like IQ in a pocket, what are you waiting for? Thus far I've taken the GR to a rave, a few dinners, and many other places that my larger ones will not go. Personally, that alone is priceless.", "Date": "May 25, 2013"}, {"Title": "Great, but . . .", "Author": "Ben Zim", "ReviewID": "R35XXYMU4LDI5R", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "I bought this camera and had it with me nearly every day.  Great to carry around, put in pocket and have a very solid camera to take everywhere.  Very easy to use as well.  Great image quality, that can't be beat for such a small size.It can be particularly excellent in situations impractical for others.  It is silent, small, convenient, easy.However, the other day while shooting a wedding (a 3rd camera on me) the camera would not got to iso 100, only 400.  It killed some shots and I didn't have time to futz with it.  Later, I reset the camera and it enabled me to then use ISO 100.  But this problem resurfaced.The camera also froze about 8 times.  Ejecting the battery would always work in resetting.  However, it also later wouldn't zoom in on photos taken properly and that would not change even with resetting.  So I returned the camera.Before trying to return, I wanted to speak to someone at Ricoh about it and see what they say.  I can't see any reasonable way to reach them.  Thankfully, I bought on Amazon and can return. Otherwise, I'd be very unhappy.This is a great camera and has some features I wish were on every camera.  Well thought out in many regards.  Only a tiny bit short on dream list of what I'd want, which is great because no camera is perfect for everything.  But instability along with an unreachable company is not something I want to sign up for.  I'm guessing I had a lemon or a firmware upgrade will resolve those issues.  I may even buy again, but need to see if they address issues in a future firmware upgrade.-------------Update:I actually may even buy this camera again if Ricoh provides a firmware upgrade to deal with above issues I experienced with mine.Amazon has always been amazing with service and came through here as well - DESPITE the seller, ACE Photo, trying to block the return despite being within the 30 days Amazon offers.  ACE tried to charge me a few hundred dollars for that trial period citing I took too many shots and that the camera - which had problems - was now \"used\".  MGR at ACE was down right rude and did what he could to block the return.  Knowing he was out of line, he wouldn't even provide me his name.  Absolutely appalling service and attitude from ACE.  They also cited it did not have problems and no one else had the same issues whereas I've seen others comment on the same.  I buy from Amazon so I can return if needed and because of their stellar service, delivery, etc., and thankfully that came through here as well despite ACE's attempts to block it.", "Date": "August 21, 2013"}, {"Title": "A true gem for those prepare to do a little digging", "Author": "Oscar Hamilton", "ReviewID": "R33H7QZDSPWWFO", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Lets begin by saying that contrary to what most might imagine, anyone, regardless of skill or artistic sensibility would be well served by owning this camera. After all, its fixed focal length, small pocketable size and extraordinary ability to yield B&W; images make it the 21st equivalent of an uber Instamatic, albeit a very expensive one. A few decades ago, cameras of this ilk were the common man's snapshot engine and there's really no reason to think that in auto mode the GR can't perform well beyond expectations of those who simply want to record head to toe images of their friends and loved ones.Of course, in modern times snappers generally expect far more amenities such as zoom lenses, portrait and sports modes, wifi etc, none of which this camera provides. And as the consumer mantra today tends to emphasize sugar over substance, more doodads obviously make for a better product. Not so in this case. Nevertheless, for the vast majority of folks looking for a new camera, all the image quality in the world could never trump this camera's lack of 'basic' conveniences. If that's where you're coming from, hit the backspace key and get the hell out of here. This camera wasn't made for you.But for those who do high tail it out of here, it is a shame, because this camera represents a true landmark in the history of photography. Dollar for dollar, ounce for ounce, cubic inch for cubic inch, it is the most powerfully concentrated still imagining tool humans have ever created. Some here have complained its not truly pocketable. Clearly none of these people ever smoked. Its just a touch larger than a pack of cigarettes and just as addictive. Addicts dont care if their fix means their jeans bulge a little, it's actually a source of comfort to be reminded every so often that what you need is just within reach whenever you need it.In even modestly skilled hands the Ricoh's image quality is truly astonishing. And while its an incredibly effective and inspiring tool for those interested in documenting the urban landscape, it is by no means limited to that venue. I now carry it with me for every round of golf I play, an activity I never before considered as a viable opportunity for image making. Throw the GR in your push cart's cup holder and while your playing companions are mucking around over thinking their next shot, you can grab some amusing shots of extra-urban life as well. And as a bonus, its wide field of view coupled with its full HD video capability is perfect for recording every painful aspect of your playing companions swing. Might even pay for itself if you threaten to take the resultant videos viral.If it isnt plain by now, I truly love this camera. Not perhaps quite in the same way as with my XE-1, but just as vehemently. The Fuji along with the X mount family of lenses is a camera system and therefore far more flexible. But there are places the Fuji simply can't go that the Ricoh can. As the old saying goes, the best camera is the one you have with you. And these days, I always have the Ricoh with me.So why then only four stars? Well, for starters despite what you might have read about the GR interface, I find aspects of it very frustrating. The basic controls are extremely good. With the exception of occasionally bumping the EV lever, I never corrupt a shot due to an inadvertent button press. For such a small camera this is miraculous. But the underlying menu system and several options found within are not as well thought out. Items are often confusing and in some cases nearly non-nonsensical. If that was the worst of it, I'd have rated the camera five stars, but the GR has one glaring flaw which I find utterly unacceptable and frankly in all the reviews I've read has never come up. I shoot in raw mode, no jpeg. The trouble is that when reviewing images the rendering on the display in many instances is utterly useless for determining the focus accuracy of the shot. Straight lines can be jagged, noise can be prevalent enough to imply missed focus or exposure.  As a result what turns out in post to be a tack sharp, nicely exposed photograph can easily be tossed in the field as unacceptable due to the lies told by the display. I've yet to use the camera in raw + jpeg which perhaps might mitigate this problem. If you do shoot raw only with the GR, I'd advise you keep everything until you've had a chance to review it off camera. Regardless of any workaround, I find this to be a very serious flaw which hopefully will be fixed in firmware sometime in the near future. One other thing to note that is that in a month or of in the pocket use, the screen has gotten some annoying scratching. I suppose I should have anticipated this, but having had iPhones that took years to show significant signs of screen wear, for a camera supposedly designed to go in your pocket, this is a problem. I'd far rather have paid the extra ounce and $50 for gorilla glass than now having to resort to film or a snap on cover. With these flaws, I simply cant give this camera a perfect rating.My final words are for those talented amateurs who take photography seriously, buy into the portability aspects of the GR, dont have a huge budget in either time or money to waste on failed experiments and have lived their entire life in the company of 24-100 mm zooms. You may be inclined to pass on this camera because despite it enticing attributes, you simply cant get past the 28mm fixed focal length. You're afraid its just too wide, too limiting, too inflexible. If that's the case, I'd urge you to summon the courage to give this little beast a try. I'm betting it will change the way you see the world for the better and forever alter how you approach capturing its beauty and ugliness. The GR is a rare class of camera that has just the right stuff to ignite a deeper more insightful passion for photography. If that sounds like something you're searching for, look no further, this is the partner you require.", "Date": "August 15, 2013"}, {"Title": "The Next GR Series Evolution Delivers in Spades", "Author": "K. Rosinbum \"\"chickentender\"\"", "ReviewID": "RCK0E5773VJO3", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This is meant to be an initial reaction review and is in no way as detailed as many write-ups that already exist on the web. Having been a ridiculously happy owner of the GRDIII since 2009, as well as an avid Pentax DSLR shooter, I pre-ordered this camera from B&H; only a couple days after it was announced, the first time I can remember ever pre-ordering anything.The GR (many refer this as the GR5) handles almost identically to my beloved GRD3 with only minor changes found here and there in the menus and controls. If you've used a GR series cam in the past, rest assured this is a GR. The weigh and handling and customization are on par with all the rest - stellar. But the truly remarkable part is the APS-C sensor that is crammed into this awesome compact. In using the camera for about 200 shots in a day I have cropping possibilities that I would not have ever DREAMED of with it's older brother the GRD3. Everything about the image quality is improved in every way in my opinion and that fact is by itself amazing. Snap focus is still present of course among new modes such as pinpoint AF and a new metering system. My only gripe thus far is the GR's autofocus seems to hunt and be much slower in lowlight compared to the GRD3, though I have heard that it is hopeful this can be much improved in firmware updates. I find the lowlight AF acceptable but definitely not as amazing as every other aspect of the cam... e.g.the exposure and High ISO performance on this model is outstanding for lowlight, the latter *more* than making up for the slightly slower lens than it's predecessor. The new lens however has a 9 blade aperture and I have noticed that the bokeh it produces when in the more open aperture ranges is much creamier than the GRDIII produces.  Also, with snap focus and manual focus available within a couple quick presses, the slower lowlight AF does not matter as much as you might think.I'll update this review down the road after I've truly put this thing through the paces, but my initial reaction is amazement... especially amazed that there has been this much improvement on a camera design I was already in love with. Hats off to Ricoh-Pentax... They've darn near nailed this one.UPDATE 1/5/2013: Just a brief update to note a very crucial change to my review. I've been very busy with videography the past several months and have not been shooting still shots nearly as much as I'd like and as such I completely missed a Firmware update from Ricoh back in mid-October. I've just installed it this evening and I have to say that the low-light focus is now *nearly* as phenomenal as my old GRIII. What this means is that there is now nothing, and I mean *nothing* I do not love about this camera. It is the bee's knees and my perfect focal companion. I now have to seriously contemplate downsizing my DSLR rig and glass. An unreal little gem this thing is.", "Date": "May 24, 2013"}, {"Title": "Great Camera in Raw Mode.", "Author": "Amazon Customer", "ReviewID": "R204XFHFXGQ3BO", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I own a Sony RX100 II and the Ricoh GR. After comparing the two I was set to return the Ricoh as the pictures from the Sony looked better and sharper under large magnification. Turns out the JPEG engine in the Ricoh is not so good. The Sony's pictures shot in Raw and JPEG look very good. The Ricoh produces excellent raw images but the JPEG's are definitely not as good. So in raw mode the Ricoh takes significantly better pictures than the Sony, no doubt due to it's much larger sensor. In JPEG mode however the Sony is better. When I want absolute best pictures in JPEG format I now shoot with the Ricoh in raw mode, import into iPhoto then export them into JPEG mode. The conversion process via iPhoto export provides excellent results. I'm sure a separate raw converter would work even better with more editing options. The Ricoh does come with Silkypix LE software which I assume offers raw conversion. I generally avoid loading other software to keep my computer uncluttered.Finally one important point. The Ricoh GR does not have image stabilization. In low light it is harder to get a clear picture than with the Sony which has stabilization.", "Date": "May 16, 2014"}, {"Title": "Best large-sensor compact on the market in 2014, ergonomic delight", "Author": "bens.optics \"Mark\"", "ReviewID": "R1F1FE4MTYCEGQ", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "If I could give it 5+ starts I would.I have owned many film and digital cameras before GR, and still do \u2013 Canon DSLRs starting with D30, many Olympus compacts (C2020, C2100 \u2018Uzi\u2019), Fujifilm X100, NEX 5N, NEX 6 as well as many lenses \u2013 85/1.8, 35/1.8, 30/2.8, 19/2.8 etc. Mostly primes. I tend to shoot wide-open and process RAW in LR5.Many of the above cameras are fantastic tools and produce wonderful images if used well. However, nothing comes close to Ricoh GR for its unique *combination* of size, weight, ergonomics, and stellar image quality.This is a true \u201cphotographer\u2019s camera\u201d and should be used to be appreciated. It doesn\u2019t look like much, but it does deliver.Pros:+ Phenomenal ergonomics that is a match, if not superior to X100 ( It\u2019s deeply customizable and designed for comfortable one-handed operation)+ Grip (very very comfortable)+ Light weight (perfect as a street camera)+ Small size (fits in the pocket, X100 is not even close, and also twice as heavy)+ Very, very sharp lens starting at F2.8 (it gets razor-sharp at F4, corner to corner)+ Wide latitude RAW files that are sharp and contrasty+ No AA filter (16Mp that is close to \u2018normal\u2019 20-22Mp output of other APS-C sensors with AA filter. LOTS of cropping ability)+ UI is close to perfect (very functional, easy to learn, easy to customize)+ ND filter that is either Manual or Automatic!+ LCD is very sharp, bright, and has fast refresh rate+ Great bargain at current prices, in the low to mid six-hundredsCons:- Auto-focus is kind of slow (it does not hunt in good light, just slow)- Auto-focus in Multi-point mode is not very reliable (be careful, as it can show green rectangles on the subject but actually  focus on other parts of the scene)- Battery indicator in not very linear, it goes pretty fast from one \u2018bar\u2019 to nothing (just get Wasabi charger with 2 batteries for ~$20 on Amazon, this should solve the problem)- Would love to have Auto-HI ISO in TAv mode (maybe future firmware update)Most of Cons are pretty minor, with the exception of AF. I suggest using single center point and then re-frame, or use excellent snap focus.Other random thoughts:I got GH-3 adapter plus hood, but it turns out I rarely use them. The hood is simply NOT required, besides it makes the GR not pocketable so it defeats the main advantage. The adapter is useful for 49mm filters, if you\u2019d like to use a polarizer, or stronger ND filter for long exposures.I got a simple neoprene case on Amazon (Case Logic), but the case, while fitting snugly, significantly increases apparent camera size. I ended up not using it, and instead got thin magic fiber draw-string bags on eBay for a few bucks, and use one to protect the camera while in the pocket.I have an optical viewfinder (adapted from Sony NEX system).  I had to remove mini-shoe from adapter the bottom to reveal standard shoe mound. That was a $70 purchase, a bargain compared with Ricoh optical viewfinders. However, it also makes the camera not pocketable, so it gets little use. My advice is before you buy any of the accessories try using GR as-is, and see if you miss anything.Overall, if you are looking for large sensor compact that actually FITS in the jean's pocket and produces great images time after time then there are very few choices. X100 is a great camera but not really pocketable. Nikon A is much more expensive and frankly UI seems un-engaging compared to GR. Sony RX100 are fine cameras but UI is, again, computer-like rather than camera-like. They are not one-handed cameras either.

The handling it great. It's so configurable and I've customized it so it mimics the 5D3's control system quite well, so switching back and forth between my cameras is easy for me.It's not a beginner's camera though. There is no image stabilization. There's no zoom. It does best when you set it to manual settings instead of putting it into auto modes (in bright conditions, I set the shutter speed and aperture and have the camera use auto-ISO).

I wish the typeface on the menus was a bit larger but that's a minor quibble, I can get to menus on the fly easily with it's physical controls.I also have a Sony RX100 and use it almost exclusively at 28mm so I wasn't worried about buying a relatively expensive compact camera with a prime lens. I have no regrets and while I wish the lens was a bit faster (f/2 would have been nice) I understand that a larger sensor meant a different lens given the small depth of the camera's body. The lens produces excellent out of focus areas when used wide open (bokeh) and has little edge to edge distortion for a wide angle lens.I have yet to experiment with all of the built-in image processing options, I'm just testing it with RAW images so far and they're excellent, deep images that are easy to process with Lightroom.For those who know what they want in a small camera, this one is certainly one to consider, the ultimate small travel/street camera for sure.", "Date": "June 10, 2013"}, {"Title": "Best compact camera I've ever owned", "Author": "Bob \"Bob\"", "ReviewID": "R3SAPR6KXNGLEQ", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "First of all, know what you would be buying: a camera with a 28mm-equivalent f/2.8 lens and no viewfinder. If that's not what you want, don't buy this, and don't downrate for being what it is.Ricoh has achieved an incredible breakthrough in weight reduction. This is the lightest APS-C (as well as when compared to micro-four thirds) camera + lens ever manufactured. The lightness of this camera is incredible given the image quality, and it's so easy to shoot one-handed and it barely weighs down your pocket (but a jacket pocket or unusually large pants pockets, don't expect this camera to fit practically into jeans pockets).Image quality: never have I encountered such incredibly sharp pictures, all the way to the corners of the photos. While there are a lot of lenses that are very sharp in the dead center, it's rare to find a wide-angle lens with such sharp corners as this. Perhaps this is the overall sharpest 28mm-equivalent lens ever made, or at least it's pretty darn close. The lens is also pretty resistant to CA and purple fringing, although I can spot some under the right circumstances (like tree branches against a bright sky). The lens seems sharpest and has the least purple fringing at f/6.3. But even wide open, the lens is no slouch at all. Also, the front element of the lens is recessed when the lens is extended, so it sort of has a built-in lens shade, which is very nice.I also praise this camera for having far more manual focus options than any other camera I've encountered. Also, having three custom modes available on the mode dial is a big plus. And kudos for having all of the camera controls easily accessible with just your right hand. The physical controls are definitely way above average for a camera of this size.Otherwise, most other aspects of this camera are average at best. Don't expect the fastest auto-focus (it's good but not great), or the best auto-color balance, or the best high-ISO compared to other APS-C contenders from Sony or Nikon. The menu system isn't especially easy to use or intuitive.The camera lacks image stabilization (perhaps a key to making the lens as small as it is), and with such a sharp lens/sensor combination, old rules about shooting at 1/30 of a second with a 28mm lens need to be thrown out. 1/125 of a sec seems like the more correct minimum shutter speed to ensure the sharpest photos.The price for this camera is a bargain considering that it has an APS-C sensor and such a sharp lens.

As with my full sized dSLRs, all the controls I need are easily accessible through \"real buttons and knobs\" on the camera body.  This is as opposed to the typical arrangement for compact cameras where functions like ISO adjustment are buried somewhere in a menu tree.I've found the image quality to be top notch.  The wide angle lens presents remarkably little distortion, the f2.8 lens provides a shallow depth of field when needed, and the sensor does a great job in low light allowing me to shoot comfortably to at least ISO 3200.  The lens doesn't zoom and the field of view is nicely wide, a bit wider than what is in my field of vision.The lack of a zoom doesn't bother me and I believe its absence contributes to the overall image quality.  I'm not an optical engineer but I've talked to enough of them to know that optics are a series of compromises and the number of them grows with each variable you introduce.  Having a camera that only uses a specific lens and that lens doesn't do anything besides adjust focus means the camera can be, and from everything I've seen in this case has been, optimized for that configuration.Another handy feature this camera provides, and it has become my favorite, is the ability to take a picture immediately when you press the shutter, without having to wait for the camera to focus.  While it does focus fairly quickly, there is still a noticeable lag.  Being able to avoid that has allowed me to capture images I would have otherwise missed.  The way it works is you can set a specific distance that the lens will immediately focus to if you depress the shutter.  When you see that once-in-a-lifetime situation, all you need do is point the camera and press the shutter.  Thanks to the wide lens and something called the hyper focal distance you can easily pick a default focus range for your situation that will properly capture anything you are likely to encounter.  And, when I want to allow the camera to focus I just depress the shutter half way (as with any other camera) and it works like \"normal\".I do three things to make this setup even more effective: - I set the camera to continuous mode.  This allows me to hit the shutter as I'm bringing the camera up and leave it down as I'm framing the shot.  In continuous mode the camera shoots four frames per second.  I've found this gets me the shot as quickly as possible.  It also acts to counteract any bounce from a clumsy shutter press. - I use an external viewfinder, the kind that slips into the flash hot shoe.  Ricoh makes a great one, I'm sure.  However, I got one from a popular online auction site at a fraction of the cost.  The quality probably isn't as good and for this application it works just fine. - When I'm carrying the camera I keep the display turned off (don't need it until I change settings, thanks to the optical finder) and the camera turned on.  The batteries last a very long time and the camera is always ready.A couple accessories I've found very handy are the OP/TECH USA Bin/Op Strap and the Wasabi Power Battery and Charger Kit for Ricoh....  The neck strap connects easily to the camera, doesn't allow the camera to slide around when it's on my neck, and supports my goal of quick access.  The batteries fit perfectly and last as long as the \"official\" one that came with the camera.  Besides, Ricoh doesn't provide an external charger with the camera and this allows you to shoot *and* charge at the same time.Ricoh provided this camera with no obligation other than I provide an unbiased review.", "Date": "August 5, 2013"}, {"Title": "Best advanced point and shoot on the market", "Author": "The Noise", "ReviewID": "R2ZFGNDLUGXMDY", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "The 28mm fixed focal lens on this camera is excellent.

If I had to sell all my cameras I would be tempted to keep just the Ricoh GR (V).This is further reinforced by the fact that after purchasing the camera I had to barely change any settings to make it function the way I want. Usually when I get a new camera I have to fight with it for a few hours or sometimes even days to get it to work just how I like it, with this one most of the defaults are just how I like it. It took me 5 minutes to figure out how to disable AF assist light, power light and beep sounds (I like my cameras not to reflect and make noise).There is simply nothing that rivals it at this price range and form factor.", "Date": "April 26, 2014"}, {"Title": "A camera for the human brain.", "Author": "Bob Moon", "ReviewID": "R1OO96ZYZN0F3V", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I am going to keep this short.

This camera is a real gem and one of my favorite point and shoot purchases by far.  I purchased this camera to replace an Sony RX100 (Dust magnet, difficult flash on/off, huge menu system, and you can't view video and images together as they are taken.) and Nikon P7700 (I like it more than the RX100, but it is so much bulkier, and if you hold a button down by accident the shutter won't fire which happens quite often).  Although I'm still on the fence on the overall value for the price and size.The Ricoh did everything I wanted and more.  I have a few pictures with 5,000 ISO and up that are simply amazing.  Blacks rarely have a lot of color noise in them at high ISO.  The dynamic range is surprising for a point and shoot.  The video is okay and not on par with the IXUS 100hS and 300HS Canon's (I've used and liked for the price for years) which take great low resolution video.The menus could be broken down into smaller segments.  It could use a setting ring around the lens.  I'd REALLY like an articulating touchscreen for this price.  The buttons are too small, and the exposure +- gets changed unexpectedly (ANNOYING! but you learn to watch for that).  Image previews and zooming are horrible, and there's no automatic picture review.  I felt the lock on the mode dial a bit overkill, especially because it doesn't stick out like other makes do.  You can't change this with one hand and keep a comfortable/firm grip on the camera.There were many times when I wanted to turn the flash on/off and the menu wouldn't come up.  It should always be available.If you use a Nikon pro DSLR the image navigation is so awkward and many buttons and dials do the same thing when they could be made more useful.

High contrast black and white mode is a blast. I borrowed a Fujifilm X100S and loved it. It's a great camera but the Ricoh makes it look like a clunky gimmick. There's a good reason why high-end DSLRs don't use retro mechanical controls - they are more clumsy and less flexible and you end up looking at the controls instead of the scene. The 35 mm equivalent Fuji lens (a stop faster than the Ricoh 28 mm) is also just not wide enough for street photography. I have shaky hands and was concerned about lack of image stabilization. With the APS-C sensor I can get clean images in low light at 1/125 shutter speed which eliminates the issue. Fill flash is spot on. Dynamic range compensation is excellent.  I don't miss the viewfinder - never been a fan of EVFs anyway. And finally, the price is right.

It needed to be small, compact, with decent image quality. I was debating among three cameras: the Olympus EP-5 w/17mm 1.8, the Fuji X100s, and this one. In the end, I decided to go with the most compact camera, which is this one. After four months of shooting and 2000 shots later, I have found that the stellar reviews that I have read seemed to have given me such high expectations that I ended up feeling somewhat disappointed with the camera.So, first, what I dislike about the camera:1) You cannot customize the exposure compensation buttons (up and down buttons on the side). I normally like shooting on M mode, and in M mode, that button just automatically adjusts your exposure to be correct (how silly - why would you want automatic exposure functions in manual exposure mode?). I would have loved to have this be set as ISO control, but alas, you cannot customize the exposure compensation buttons.2) So why not TAV mode? It's practically manual mode, just with no ISO control. Basically the camera decides the ISO. This however is not the same as Auto-Hi ISO, meaning that you CANNOT set a maximum ISO. How infuriating. Shooting in low light is nearly impossible with this mode.3) In-camera noise reduction is awful. It renders faces in artificial lighting very poorly and makes them look plasticky. So JPG shooters, ought to consider reducing the noise reduction or just removing it entirely and use software to lower noise.The meh:1) Image quality is okay; I was expecting a stellar performance since nearly every critic raves about the image quality. To be fair, image quality is good for a camera this size, but if I get this kind of image quality from an APS-C sized sensor in any other body, I would be a little let down. Maybe it's a matter of preferences, but I find that my 7D looks better even though DxO Mark rates the Ricoh sensor 12 points higher (78 to the 7D's 66).2) Focal length being at a fixed 28mm FF equivalent means you're stuck with this length. While those who love this focal length will have no problems, make sure that you are absolutely okay with it. Shoot at 28mm often and try to think if you will adapt to it and produce beautiful images with it. I felt like I would, but in the end, I still gravitate towards a more standard focal length (around 40-50mm).3) Ergonomics and build quality - like I mentioned earlier, this camera is not as customizable as one would hope. Only three buttons are customizable essentially (Fn1, Fn2, and Effects). Of course you can switch the aperture and shutter speed dials in TAV and M modes, but really, customization isn't as good as it seems. However, the rest of the ergonomics are excellent. Everything else is kept simple and clean and are intuitively placed. Build quality is just okay. I like the rugged textured body, but it was surprisingly lightweight and felt more fragile than it looked.What I loved:1) It is super small and super compact. To get an idea of the size, it's about the size of two iPhones placed back to back. This means that it will fit in most pockets, and that you can carry it with you everywhere. And like I said, the image quality isn't bad for its size.2) Snap focus mode. This is an amazing thing. Without this feature, the Ricoh would be an utter failure. It has pretty slow autofocus in low light conditions and it doesn't have good manual focus ergonomics, so the snap focus is definitely a redeeming quality when you cannot rely on AF. Just don't forget to turn off Macro mode; otherwise, when you snap down on the shutter, hoping for a quick shot, the lens will hunt forever. You'll be walking away trying to review your shot, wondering why the playback button won't work when you realized that the lens is STILL trying to focus.3) Good AF in good light. The AF is unreliable in low-light but that's expected for most compact, contrast-focusing cameras. In well-lit areas, AF is pretty fast - not as fast as the incredibly fast Olympus EP-5 or Fuji X100s, but definitely fast enough.So all in all, a decent camera. I just wish the image quality was as good as I had hoped. But I suppose that's my own fault for reading so many reviews and having high expectations. And I wished the exposure compensation buttons could be used for ISO adjustment in M mode. For now, I will keep this camera, but I expect to jump ship as soon as the next \"small\" thing hits stores.", "Date": "December 24, 2013"}, {"Title": "Ninja camera", "Author": "Brian Hayes", "ReviewID": "R2GE3U7DWAR5N1", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I absolutely love this camera! Compared to my girlfriend's DSLR, this camera is so much more pocketable, which means it's easier to pull out when an opportunity strikes. I'm also relatively new to photography and this camera has been easy to learn, providing many straightforward options in an easy-to-navigate menu. I like the ability to edit RAW photos on the camera itself. The 16 MP A-COS sensor is fairly ubiquitous right now, and the image quality is decent. I just got back from a trip to Kauai and have hundreds of photos.Battery life and view finding are my only complaints. The view finder adapter is $250. I find the LCD screen usable, but slightly less creative because I shoot looking at the screen, not the image itself. Also the battery life supports around 290 photos. This seems like a lot, but because of the size, this camera prompts a high volume of shooting.I highly recommend this camera for beginners that want to learn. There are helpful exposure and other display settings to teach you how the camera functions.

It's incredible how such a powerful camera has made it into such an unassuming package.First of all, the quality of the images is outstanding.  I have used it for landscapes, street scenes and even macro photography - and I have not been disappointed.  Straight-out-of-camera JPGs look great; the RAW images need some post-processing, and are very malleable in Lightroom; black and white conversion in particular produces stunning results.Second, the ergonomics are nearly flawless.  The rubber grip fits my hand perfectly, and allows me to hold the camera in one hand while simultaneously changing settings with the thumb and forefinger of that hand.  The external controls allow me to quickly and easily adjust aperture, ISO, exposure compensation, etc.  As others have noted, the controls of the Ricoh GR are very customizable, and I've played with around a number of different configurations.  Ricoh clearly designed this camera with photographers in mind.I had thought that the lack of a viewfinder would be a downside, but I have found composing using the LCD screen to be easy, even in very bright conditions.  If this camera had IBIS (I have been spoiled by the OM-D E-M5 in that regard), it would be perfect.Before buying the Ricoh GR, I tried the RX100 and the Nikon A.  The RX100 produces wonderful images, but I did not like the external controls and I did not like how it felt in the hand (though adding the Franiec grip helps).  The Nikon A seems like a terrific enthusiast's camera, but it is not better than the Ricoh GR, and certainly not several hundred dollars better.

This purchase had been my first investment in a real purpose-built street camera. My budget had been considerably higher, and the final cameras in the running were this, the Fujifilm X100S, and the Sony DSCRX1R. My budget was clearly much higher than what I spent.Not to be understated is the difference between (effective) 28mm focal length and 35mm. With a 35mm effective focal length, the photographer must be fairly close to the subject, but can still assume a somewhat safe distance. At 28mm, you must be right in the thick of things, so close to your subject that they can lay hands on you (if they were so inclined) without taking a step. I'm finding a certain intimacy at this focal length that was somewhat diminished at 35mm.The Ricoh GR is insanely pocketable for such a high quality camera. As a result, I take it with me everywhere. When I go out on the streets, even just to walk to lunch from my office, the camera is in my hand. It's small enough, and low-key enough (almost entirely black, minus a fairly low-key \"GR\" on the front) that my subjects almost never appear threatened by the presence of the camera.If you're running in one of the manual modes, the controls are right at your fingertips without having to shift your view away from the viewfinding screen. They are very well laid-out and I've found them to be convenient. I have very large hands and have not had a problem here.I generally shoot in one of the three user-programmable modes. For daytime outdoor use, I'll preprogram it for TAv (Shutter-Aperture Priority) where I dial in the aperture and shutter speed I want, and the camera picks the best ISO for the job. For my work, I don't mind a little grain/noise if the camera goes high on the ISO but I do want more control over depth of field and shutter speed when I'm on the go. The metering of this camera has been outstanding and I have not regretted using this mode. There is also a snap focus mode, but the auto focus is very quick and accurate in the daylight. This camera will hunt for focus in low light, be warned.The flash is almost always turned off for me, but I've found that when it is needed, it is fairly pleasing (as much so as on-camera flash can be).I've had no problem importing & processing the RAW files in Adobe Photoshop Lightroom 5]. I also like Street Presets, which are not available through Amazon.I debited a star for one major reason: battery life. When I'm walking around and the camera is turned on all the time, I can't even fill a 4GB card before the battery goes kaput and the camera unceremoniously shuts off. Spare batteries are expensive and largely unobtainable, even at Ricoh's high price. Aftermarket batteries are not available at the time of this writing, as best as I can tell.If you want to see examples of photos I've taken with this camera, and stylized in Lightroom, follow @Ralwegians on Twitter, or check out Ralwegians fan page on Facebook.

I have to say that it took me a few weeks to warm up to the camera.If you're like me you are going to want to explore the camera extensively. You'll soon find the camera to have a myriad of features and optimizations that could be daunting to those who are impatient. Unfortunately, I am a bit impatient and found myself struggling in operating the camera effectively. Of course, leaving the camera on Auto will eliminate the complexities of the camera.The camera is well built and balanced. The large grip is a big plus that gives the user a boost of confidence in shooting the camera without concern of slipping. The GR is a small camera; about the size of an Olympus XZ-1 or Panasonic LX-5. The fact that they were able to put an APS-C sensor in a small body is a great feat of engineering. It is one terrific reason for purchasing the camera. To be able to carry a small camera that produces DSLR like quality has been the dream of many photographers for a long time. The Ricoh GR is successful in building that type of camera.The many customization's and features the GR possesses is both a delight and a maddening experience. In that regard, the GR requires some experimentation and trial and error to get the camera to shoot the way you intend too. There is no question that the GR can be very versatile and quick to use - it has all the manual controls and customization's to satisfy your shooting habits - but  getting there can be a little bit of journey. And the reason is because the Ricoh is a machine that has to be finely tuned to your habits. Some of the features and customization's the GR has are unique to Ricoh, and can therefore be somewhat troublesome to those who are new to the Ricoh system.Once you get the settings correct, however, the camera is quick and responsive. The auto-focus on the GR is fast and does well in low light. I've read some reviews from other people who have complained about the speed of the auto-focus and the poor performance of the AF in low light conditions. Honestly, I haven't any problems with those issues at all, but maybe that is because I am using the latest firmware that might have corrected those issues. The GR also has the snap-focus feature which can utilize hyper-focal and zone-focusing techniques.It's safe to say that the GR has many features and gives the user the ability to shoot how they prefer. The features the user uses the most can be assigned to any number of customized buttons or the handy customized lever. In essence, giving the user a highly customized machine.The GR has many different filters within the camera, and the reason I specifically mention them is because I find them to be very good. Filters like the high contrast B/W, positive film, or beach bypass filters I found to be very useful on many occasions. You can shoot these in JPEG or process the raw files in the camera.The pictures the GR renders are sharp. I find the JPEG's to be a little flat in color and contrast, especially if you're going to compare it to the Olympus or Fuji pictures which have a lot of \"pop\" to their JPEG's. In that regard I would compare the GR JPEG's to that of Pentax JPEG's. However, as I mentioned earlier, the filters on the GR are terrific.RAW files are very good and malleable in post processing. The GR also produces good tonality for B/W pictures.Pictures on the GR can get a little noisy rather quickly when raising the ISO number. Even at low ISO numbers (400-800) the GR can produce a small amount of grainy noise. This can be a negative to some but I personally don't mind the grain. The grain is not unattractive as it is in some other cameras with smaller sensors. But that is a personal preference.Ricoh is also very active in firmware updates. Releasing updates to fix certain glitches and adding even more features to an already stacked featured camera.The Ricoh GR is not the most user friendly camera. There is a reason why Ricoh is considered to be the camera maker for geeks.  The vast amount of features on the camera to many, including myself, can seem to be unnecessary and over the top. However, the user can make it as simple or difficult as they want in utilizing the GR; at the end of the day the GR is a compact, powerhouse of a camera that delivers DSLR quality pictures.

Interesting to note the Ricoh GR opted to use the highly regarded Sony sensor 16 MP that is used on the Nikon D7000, Pentax K5/K5II, Sony NEX series and Olympus OMD, Nikon Coolpix A so there are no surprises when it comes to the image quality although the GR truly shines is Monochrome mode, Ricoh has hands down tuned it well that it still has the nostalgic film like that the other camera companies can't match.For some that ask why is there no zoom, blah blah, folks this is a 28mm focal length prime lens, when it comes to prime lenses you're the one that is going to do the zooming not the camera. The rationale behind it is that it forces you to be more creative and to focus on the composition of your photos if you can live with a fixed focal length the GR will reward you.Although it's tough to get your hands on this one right now, it's truly worth the wait because no other APS-C compact camera can match the features it offers for the solid asking price Ricoh/Pentax asks.", "Date": "July 16, 2013"}, {"Title": "Good...very good...not perfect for me.", "Author": "MS", "ReviewID": "R1FBFG2SE1WB6G", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Let me first say that this is a nice little camera. But ultimately I didn't decide to purchase it (rented it for a week). It is truly everything that you have read; small, sturdy, quick, customizable, and the image quality is reasonable. I enjoyed being able to set a custom function to flip between the 28mm and 35mm crop modes quickly. The 28mm focal length is not my ideal, but that's a completely personal choice, no mark against the camera as many famous photographers have used this range. The 35mm crop gives about a 10 megapixel file and the quality is still quite good. It is very small in size but durable which is great for having your camera with you everywhere. The camera is very responsive, focuses fast. I thought I would love the snap-focus feature but ended up not using it much because the camera can focus so fast. Even if you're shooting in RAW you can still change the effects (B&W;, cross-process, high contrast, etc) which will be reflected on the LCD while shooting. You can see the world in B&W; and your RAW images will still just be color RAWs for your later conversion.In the end, even though I respect the camera a lot, I didn't find it fully satisfying. Again it's small, but it's still not exactly pocketable; it will fit in a jeans pocket but sitting down and even walking around it gets a bit squished. Since it isn't really fully pocketable all the time I started to wonder why I wasn't just carrying my Fuji X100. It's got better image quality and is a more enjoyable camera to use. The GR feels like a typical, 21st century digicam, not a lot of style so-to-speak, which is not a deal breaker but important to my personal enjoyment of taking pictures. I think not having an optical viewfinder to compose with is part of the reason. The lens is sharp, no argument there, but the images are somewhat middle of the road, not bad in any way, but not characteristic either like the X100, even after editing RAW images. I can easily distinguish images between the two cameras. That's actually what made my decision final; I was looking through some images and was suddenly struck by one and thought 'wow, this camera takes incredible photos' and I realized it was a photo from the Fuji.To summarize, I mean no criticism of the camera, I liked it a lot, it lives up to its promises and online reviews. It's quite an amazing camera really but not a great fit for me personally. I really recommend renting it before buying. I really thought about just purchasing it sight unseen as I thought it sounded like a perfect go-anywhere and street photography camera but in the end I decided what I had already was better for me.", "Date": "July 21, 2013"}, {"Title": "Underwhelming", "Author": "Marcus Censor", "ReviewID": "RV4ZT85KCRFOZ", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "The GR is about half the price of the x100s, and as soon as it's in your hands you know why.All the switches, dials, etc. feel as wobbly bits. Maybe some of you remember \"disposable\" cameras, and once you took a photo you had to spin that plastic dial with your thumb for the next frame. The front right dial of the camera, controlled by the index finger of your right hand, feels exactly like that: very \"toy-like\" or \"juvenile\" as does the jog dial. When manipulating the controls you feel like you don't want to push or press too hard or you might break them.I'm not sure why reviewers call this camera \"durable\" or \"solid\" when it's not really that way at all.Image quality is above average due to the sensor, though not as good (in my opinion) as the x100s with considerably more noise once you hit 1600. With the x100s I can shoot 3200 without worrying about it. Not so with the GR.There's also this funny business about the GR automatically setting ISO in TAv mode to ridiculously atmospheric levels, like 6400 without any justification.The one area where the GR may outshine the x100s is in RAW conversion to black and white. Awesome detail in the GR's RAW files.But in the end, for me, the GR stands for a Great piece of Rubbish. It is basically a nice big sensor in a disposable body.
