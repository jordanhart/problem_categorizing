It is the smallest 3.3mp camera on the market and takes incredible pictures. The best part about this camera is its ability to take both type 1 and type 2 cf cards. This means that the S20 can use  the IBM Microdrive (170 or 340 mb). With the 340 mb drive (@$400, with  pcmcia card adapter), the camera can hold 379 shots at largest size with  medium resolution, or 164 shots at largest size with best resolution. I  literally shoot all day and sort the pictures out later. No more asking  yourself, \"should I take this shot, or will I fill the card too  quickly.\" If you are not going to buy the microdrive, I really don't  see the need to pay $800 for this camera. Its like buying a rolls royce and  getting bicycle tires. Also, be aware that the S20 takes a proprietary  battery (cannot be replaced by regular batteries in a pinch). When you buy  the camera, buy at least one extra battery that day. Nothing is worse than  having 150 shots left, but a dead battery. I love my S20, but be aware that  after the camera, charger, 340mb microdrive and an extra battery, you are  talking about $1350.", "Date": "July 12, 2000"}, {"Title": "Great Camera", "Author": "Dave", "ReviewID": "R1WTVD6T7KRZGW", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I have been looking at digital cameras for the past year, The prices just couldn't be justified for me... Until the 3million megapixel camera's came out.  This isn't the right camera for professional shooting, as it does not  take raw tiff's.. but the large superfine Jpeg's turn out close enough to  raw images. This is a high end Point and Shoot camera, you do not need  professional photography experience to take great photos. The camera is  small and lightweight.. similar to the Canon ELPH camera's design.. so it  can slide in your pocket.. And Canon has been known for their optics for  years.  The software works fine, I just use Adobe Photoshop to get my  images though.  The photostiching is neat, and works well, I took pictures  in a circle around my apartment and stitched them seamlessly together to  make a really wide panoramic shot.. using USB to get your images is FAST, I  had no problems setting the camera up with USB or Serial.  The cons of this  camera is that it doesn't come with rechargable batteries (a MUST have) get  the recharge/ac adaptor kit, or else you will spend hundreds on batteries.  the 16MB CF card will fit about 100 average quality photo's, 34 above  average, but only 7 SuperFine quality photo's (time to go buy a bigger CF  card).. Digital camera's are going to be expensive, especially if you want  quality and features, The higher end Kodak's, Sony's and Olympus's offer  about the same features and quality, but the Kodak and Sony are much larger  and bulkier.

I would agree with the other reviewers on this page with one exception: according to one reviewer you can't check the quality of your photo immediately after  shooting - this is not true: keep the shutter button pressed in after  shooting and the photo appears on the TFT screen until you release the  button. The supplied 16Mb flash card is not enough for efficient use, but  it does get you started. You can take 44 photos in medium res (1024 x 768)  which is good enough quality for screen viewing. Batteries will last long  enough to fill the 16 Mb card but I bought 2 extra rechargables with mine  and I keep TFT screen and flash use to a minimum when not near a power  supply. My biggest niggle with the Canon is that in Auto mode it only takes  pictures in the highest resolution, something like 8 or 9 photo's on the 16  Mb card. With maybe a 170 or 340 Mb IBM micro drive and a couple of extra  rechargable batteries this is a brilliant little machine suitable for most  users, takes great pictures and fits in your jacket pocket too!", "Date": "June 18, 2000"}, {"Title": "Amazing", "Author": "boonedocks", "ReviewID": "R2D260OPF3TCDK", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I picked up this camera to do a web catalog photo shoot of flowers.

I really liked the 3.34MPixel resolution.  It is easy to turn out some really nice photos.  I haven't owned another digital camera, so it is difficult to judge battery life, however, many of the digitals do not have a way to turn off the LCD.  Doing so greatly enhances battery life.  Also, instead of the IBM 340Mb micro drive, try the SANS 256MB flash card.  It has much lower battery consumption and still holds 100-300 (in hi-res mode) photos depending upon compression settings.Also, GET the battery charger kit!  It has a NiCad included.  I saved the original lithium as an emergency battery, plus I bought an additional NiCad.

So-so battery life.In addition, I found that the camera was fairly easy to use. I was able to do the basic things -- take photos, change the resolution, erase, etc. -- on a first or second try. (Then I read the manual to figure out the advanced stuff.)My only dislike of this camera is that its automatic whiteness settings aren't true to life: it's too blue. For example, light-skinned (caucasian and some asians) people's skin has a bluish tint to it. You can play around with the manual settings to get accurately colored photos, but it's a pain to adjust the whiteness for every single snapshot you want to take. The resulting discolorations can generally be fixed in Photoshop, of course, but having to do this for every photo is not ideal.I had heard about the whiteness issues before I bought the camera and purchased it anyway. I'm glad I did; the resolution, its size, and overall quality are worth the slightly disappointing optical issues.", "Date": "December 12, 2000"}, {"Title": "Great Camera - bad battery", "Author": "S.

It performs outstandingly, and its small size is excellent for carrying in a pocket or purse.  The images, at full 8X10 size when printed on photo paper by a decent printer (HP 932C in my case, about $200), were SO GOOD that people came from all over work to view them in my cubicle.  The zoom is outstanding, the macro is easily as good, the ease of use makes it perfect for the novice, while the flexibility and carriability make it excellent for the most professional (or addicted) photographer around.The ONLY problem I have is that the camara is EXTREMELY sensitive to moisture.  The instruction manual does not make that clear enough, and my camara was ruined after three months by a humid environment.  I can only say excellent camara, EXTREMELY POOR CUSTOMER RELATIONS BY CANON.  Fortunately for me, Amazon went to bat for me on this purchase, and I highly recommend ANY Amazon purchase.In summation, GREAT camara (even at the $600 I paid, and the $400 price now), crappy customer service by Canon, and truely proffesional sales and support practices by Amazon.JUST DON'T EVER LET THE CAMARA EXPERIENCE EVEN SLIGHT LEVELS OF HUMIDITY!!!!!!!!", "Date": "November 1, 2001"}, {"Title": "The Best Little Digital Camera Out There", "Author": "Cliff Bauer \"Cliff\"", "ReviewID": "R3LP5U8OO1RNQR", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "The Canon S20 is the perfect combination of simplicity, function, and high technology. The camera takes fantastic pictures that are consistently clear, ungrainy, and in focus, even in odd lighting conditions. The metering system is great, as is the autofocus and the telephoto; all work near-flawlessly.The S20's greatest strengths is its simplicity and its size. Although it does not offer advanced features (such shutter-speed priority, full manual, etc.) that some of the Nikons and more expensive Canons do, even an inexperienced camera user (digital or not) will have no problem taking great photographs. All of the moderately complicated features on the Canon such as macro-mode, toggling the flash, and red-eye reduction are as easy as hitting a clearly labelled, obvious button. Additionally, the S20 is just like a \"regular old camera.\" There are no bizare swivling things like on the Nikons, and more importantly, the camera is small enough to fit easily in a small bag or large pocket.Please note that in addition to the camera itself, you will have to buy the battery recharger and, unless you want to be limited to a few megs, an extra PC card which will both add some money to your purchase.

The people who use this camera have never used a camera in their life, so having them come to me the next day and telling me how easy it is, was a great relief to me.The only draw back to this camera is the battery, I highly suggest buying the charger kit for this camera for the added money, mostly because the battery that comes with it drained after the first two hours, and $20 for each new battery is really not worth it.", "Date": "December 26, 2000"}, {"Title": "Used for almost a year under various conditionsGreat Camera!", "Author": "Jason Shea", "ReviewID": "R2KEBD9EWFBDBX", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "My dad bought this camera just under a year ago and he bought the IBM 340mb micordrive and about 3 extra batteries(wise decision). I took it with me to Vancouver,BC  this summer and shot over 600 pictures in two weeks all on the superfine,large resolution and the quality surpases 35 mm film by fAR. You can fit over 1000 images on the lowest quality but on the highest you can fit around 90-100. Don't even think about using a digital camera any less than 128mb because you'll run out of room quickly. Although this is the first digital camera I have used, I am an experienced photographer and this camera simply makes taking pictures more relaxing and whats better is that you dont need to freak out if 90% of the photos you shot were useless. I used this camera at altitudes of 9000+feet and under very cold conditions and in total darkness as well as on the back of a motorcycle at 90 miles hour. I had used the camera many times prior but I was concerned with getting the most out of my pictures while on vacation so I utilized almost every mode and option on this camera.Pros: -excellent quality during high speed photography even with low light -small, light, durable. I gave up carrying around a [price] nikon slr and a video camera for this baby. -stitch assist mode actually works great; basically it makes panoramas out of a series of pictures you shot. I used it for overlooking Stanley park, grousse mountain, and the totem poles in capilano as a test and I was amazed that it actually worked. Very easy too.Cons: -Battery power is a major issue especially if you have a microdrive which i recommend for this camera if it is cheaper than a 5oomb flashcard; with the lcd screen off you can shoot maybe 90 pics and the highest resolution with the flash. My sister did it at a party 91shots in under 5 minutes and drained a fully charged battery.  -not really manual controls, you cant set aperature and shutter speed but use fast shutter, slow shutter, etc.-flash is good indoors even in complete darkness but outdoors the range is severly limited to about 15 feet at mostI'm assuming if you are reading this you are doing a fair bit of research before buying so you've already encountered the same complaints about battery power and memory but really this camera has the same issues as most digital cameras so there arent any major problems specific to the s-20.

After using it for a few days, I realized that it is truly a beginner's camera.  There is little manual options and those that are there, are very \"dumbed down.\"  The resulting pictures from the 3.3 Megapixel CCD are extraordinary.  They are very sharp and crisp.  However, if you are taking pictures of objects further than about 5 ft. away, make sure there is ample lighting because the flash is sub-par.  The Microdrive and the power supply kit certainly add to the overall price of the product, but IMHO, are true necessities.

I did a lot of research, wanting to make sure I bought the right one.  My first camera was a very expensive mistake.  It took proprietary clik! disks and took forever to write to the disk.  The pictures weren't superb either.So when I went out to buy a new camera, I really did my homework.  I was a little taken aback by the fact that I had to purchase the rechargeable battery and charger seperately.  In the end it was the best camera there was, so I sucked it up and bought it seperately.  I now use the original battery sent with the camera as a backup in case the rechargeable one runs out.My only beef with this camera is that in the \"Image\" mode, the display automatically turns on.  There is apparently no way to turn this setting off.  The only course of action is to depress the \"Display\" button twice to turn it off, and you have to wait two to three seconds to do so.  The reason I insist on taking pictures in this mode is because it has a \"Fast Shutter\" setting, which is *absolutely* necessary for taking pictures of a baby with flailing limbs (or now, a constantly moving toddler).  I've also used it to get some great shots of fish zipping by in tanks at the aquarium.  It really DOES make a difference.It is both a blessing and a curse that you must continue to depress the shutter button for a display of the picture you have just taken.  A blessing because if you don't WANT to see the picture, it doesn't waste the battery.  A curse because when you DO want to see the picture, you usually forget to hold the button down!  Usually, I'll take a series of pictures of various things and playback and delete ones I don't like, so it's not a problem.This camera takes GREAT outdoor pictures in bright light, very clean and crisp shots.  Indoor pictures are nice as well, but if there is not enough light you must remember to use the flash.  Sometimes the flash does not work if you are too far away from the subject, but that goes for almost all digital cameras.  The pictures are SO great, that we've stopped using our other \"expensive\" olympus semi-pro camera (circa 1998).  That one still takes great pictures, but the cannon takes great pictures at a higher resolution with more megapixels.  So we tend to use my camera for anything we intend to print out.While it's great that this camera takes type I and type II CF cards (ie: microdrives), it's not absolutely necessary to use one with this camera.  CF type I cards are so cheap now, that if you don't mind switching cards every now and then, you can use a few 128 MB cards or something similar.  128 MB cards hold ~35-40 high res pictures on one card.  The display will tell you it can hold 58, but it lies!  It usually takes off two pictures for each you take at the highest resolution.", "Date": "May 31, 2002"}, {"Title": "Poor ergonomics, mediocre picture quality", "Author": null, "ReviewID": "R186W4CJCGQ1C", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "I've owned this camera for about two years, and I'm generally pretty unhappy with it.My biggest complaint is the incredible delay between the time you hit the shutter button and the time this thing actually snaps off a picture ... it varies depending on conditions, but usually is a full 2-3 seconds.  That doesn't sound like much, but try counting it to yourself ... one Mississippi, two Mississippi, three Mississippi ... and imagine trying to take any kind of action shot with that sort of delay.  Forget about kid pictures, they don't sit still long enough for this thing!  I've gotten more pictures of the backs of my kids' heads than I can count.The digital zoom is hokey and clumsy to use.  The optical zoom works well, but is underwhelming at 2x power.The detail in the full 3 megapixel shots is very nice, but the color balance and exposure are often too dark, too orange, whatever.  Outdoor shots in full light usually look good with nice contrast and detail.  The flash is weak, as noted by other reviewers.Nearly all of this camera's functions are dependent on a fragile four-way \"joypad\" control.  Mine broke after a few months, and was replaced free (after another 2 months of delay) by Canon.  The knob on the top that selects operating modes feels very flimsy, and sticks out such that it is easily jarred into an \"on\" setting when the camera is slipped into or out of a pocket or bag.Canon's lack of inclusion of a rechargeable battery and recharger are inexcusable for a camera that burns through $15 disposable batteries in a few days.One last complaint -- this camera is heavy for its size!

Ridiculous", "Author": null, "ReviewID": "RP75APJM78NF", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "The battery included with the S20 camera lasts approximately an hour.  At that point you soon discover that a power cord and a rechargeable battery were not included with the product (the included battery is a throw away Lithium).  You are apparently forced then to purchase the \"Canon Power Supply Kit\" (which includes a rechargeable battery) for [$].  Well, it's a good thing I don't need to take pictures anytime soon.  Sure, I'll wait two weeks for replacement batteries and/or the [$] rechargeable battery kit to arrive.  A rechargeable battery and a power cord are ABSOLUTELY necesary for this product.  These items ABSOLUTELY should have been included with the original product (outside the US the \"Canon Power Supply Kit\" is included with the original purchase).  I am returning my S20 camera because of this. I will be purchasing a new digital camera from a company that does not force its customers to pay an extra [$] for something that should have been included with the original product.  After you factor in the [$] battery kit surcharge to the purchase price of the S20, there are plenty of other, better, and cheaper digital cameras out there.Also, the S20's image quality was not as good as I expected, though I only had 1 hour to check it out before the battery died.", "Date": "January 12, 2001"}, {"Title": "The most useful digital camera on the market today.", "Author": "Logan L. Lindquist \"llbbl\"", "ReviewID": "RU5IFRWMPVYZC", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I see the average consumer having too primary needs for a digital camera. The first and most important in their mind is a tool to record those moments that need to last forever. This translates into a digital versus film because of the unparalled ability of digital to display the recorded image. These are the shots that include family and friends, everyday life. Other important factors in choosing a camera that will handle this aspect would be zoom and flash. From what I have seen of the performance of such a small camera, it does fine.I can't wait until canon makes SLR rangefinder digital cameras similar to the s20, but with the option of extended zoom capability. That would be cool.The second most important need that I can percieve is a camera that is portable enough that it is not a big deal to carry with you most of the time. This would be for those shots that the consumer says \"Oh that looks cool\". This camera fits the bill perfectly bieng the smallest on the market that is able to support a microdrive.I think toshiba recently released a 5 gig mircodrive. I can't believe how many pictures this translates to. Of course it costs almost as much as the camera, but for people whom are serious about recording a moment in their life, then the investment in the camera / rechargeable batteries / leather case / microdrive goes without saying.Hope this helps!", "Date": "July 28, 2001"}, {"Title": "An excellent little camera...", "Author": "Mike C.", "ReviewID": "R1UU33KIQ05V8R", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This is an excellent little digital camera that is both rich in features and high in megapixel resolution--compared to the competition.

My other Camera is a G2 and admit the G2 is far better than the S20. As most will agree the battery is flat too soon to trust for more than 20 mins. I've built some Li-ion batteries for this camera and solved the problem. I now can run almost 3hrs. before  a charge in needed. Canon made a big mistake powering this with 5 AAA Ni-MH cells, should have been the Li-ion's like my G2. The G2 goes forever on a charge and the Li-ion batteries hold a solid charge with a very low rate of static dicharge.The S20 is still a valid camera in my bag and many of my local news photos are shots taken with my S20. Its been a solid kick around digital thats hit the floor many more times than any plastic model could ever take, and if its too heavy for some then I guess you'd be crying about why Canon made the case out of plastic. Yes I have dents in my S20 but the case is why my S20 has lasted the many miles and bumps it has.
