It takes fabulous pictures when in Auto mode, and is also fully manual if you want to put in a little more effort.  The kit is alright.  The extra rechargeable batteries are nice, but the case and most of the little extras are poor quality.  The camera actually doesn't even fit well in the case.", "Date": "April 3, 2013"}, {"Title": "My Fujifilm HS20", "Author": "Betty White", "ReviewID": "R2OP0UDRYWXB0Z", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I take this camera everywhere.

I am a novice photographer and this camera looks and feels like a DSLR. I especially like the manual zoom for its feel. One might want to check out the fujiguys channel on youtube to get a good understanding of the camera features.Accessory Bundle: The price for the bundle with 8 re-chargeable batteries, a 16 GB memory card and camera bag is good, but I am very disappointed with the tripod and the battery charger. The charger that I got was very flimsy and one of its sockets was damaged. In addition, it would falsely indicate that the batteries were charged, so a couple of times I had them die on me after a single shot. I would recommend that you invest in a good charger. I am currently using a duracell charger and it seems to be working well.Additionally, when I saw the image of the tripod I assumed it would be much bigger. However, the one in the bundle is really tiny and is pretty much of no use as the camera keeps tipping over. The only use of this tripod is when one wants to clean the camera, but since it is so small I am unable to use it.In all, the price is good for all that you get, but I would recommend buying a separate charger.", "Date": "May 14, 2012"}, {"Title": "akawillie", "Author": "akawillie", "ReviewID": "R13GWJBO4AGR9M", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Product was everything I expected, and more.
