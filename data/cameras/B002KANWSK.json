Kocmoud", "ReviewID": "R1WQ9RXZYHW61V", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I bought my Nikon S640 pocket digital camera after I dropped my Olympus pocket camera and broke it this summer. I was an avid Cannon and Olympus fan and finally decided to try a Nikon this time after reading some of the online reviews before the launch of this camera in the market in Sept 2009. I must say, this is by far, the BEST pocket camera I have ever owned! The pictures are consistently crisp with vibrant colors in any setting and that is using only the AUTO feature for settings.  I took the camera to Paris in Oct and took many night shots -- all with no flash , and only had 4 out of 125 that I had to delete because they were too blurry to use. The high ISO (6400) in low light is a real differentiator for this camera. I also liked the fast shutter lag between startup and first pic as well as between pics.  Its  a bit longer if using the flash, but overall, much improved over my Olympus.  I have a Cannon digital Rebel 5MP that I used to consider my favorite / BEST camera for special occasion photography, but now I think I can easily consider my new Nikon the BEST for ANY occasion. I Highly recommend this camera.", "Date": "November 1, 2009"}, {"Title": "Absolutely LOVE this camera!", "Author": "jocool459", "ReviewID": "R2E50MCJVT1G1A", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I was looking for a point-and-shoot for those priceless shots of my granddaughter and this one is just what I wanted!

The features on the camera could be better, I've seen more options and better detail on other camera designs. If your just looking for something that you can have around and use on the go without too much flipping through a user guide this is definitely your type of camera.Construction is neat enough that slipping in and out a new battery or Memory Card is a breeze. The only thing I found a bit of a bug was the small buttons with only icons to tell you what their use is, though once you master those icons its not much of an issue.Picture quality is a bit sub-par even for a 12.2 megapixel camera, switching through the very limited features to different conditions and settings, it seems to do best without using the flash, and does better with more exposure time which is a bit out of the ordinary, the setting for best shot selection in particular allows for more exposure without too much fiddling with the settings. Obviously, there is a reason that was put on this camera.As far as Portability goes this camera is compact enough for any purse or glove box, or even a pocket on the side of your pant leg. It weighs next to nothing and has the convenience of always being ready if you need it with its Lithium Ion Battery. Just a simple flick of a switch its ready to go and shoot 10 or 100 or 10,000 pictures depending on your memory card, and the picture quality selection.I have yet to test the video clip setting on this camera, though am quite sure it would have the same quality or worse than a normal picture due to the already below average quality of pictures.Overall, I got what I asked for, in some regard though was a bit disappointed at the picture quality and was forced to clip a star from it.

Barrett", "ReviewID": "RKBS0TIRQ2E2K", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I purchased this camera through Amazon about a month ago, in anticipation of an upcoming cruise to the Caribbean.My goals when buying this camera were pretty straightforward.1) Good picture quality.2) Very portable. Something to fit in jeans / short pockets.3) Fast interface and quick to snap photos.4) Limited motion blur. Basically image and camera stabilization.After packing this camera around everywhere I went for 10 days straight, and using it religiously over the course of the past 4 weeks, I must say I am very happy with the results. My pictures from the Caribbean turned out spectacular, as have all the others in between. So here is the breakdown.1) Picture quality is great. It does a pretty good job on the auto settings, but it isn't terribly hard to manipulate your shot in manual mode as well, if you're into that.2) For 10 days straight I packed the camera around in jeans pockets and board shorts. It is light and easy to carry, fits just fine, and isn't a pain.3) The interface is incredibly fast! It loads up super quick! It does take an extra second or two before all the features are fully loaded, but that was of no concern to me. Navigating the interface is a breeze. You're able to take photos pretty quickly, and with the adjustable ISO you can make it even faster if you so desire. To start it up, and snap a good quality photo in auto mode, might take 3 seconds or so. Very happy about that.4) This thing is incredible when it comes to blur. I was so impressed I even did a series of tests with it. In auto mode it is easy enough to capture a car traveling 50mph+ with no blur, from a standstill. I took it in my car and on surface streets, traveling 30mph+, captured photos of the city with no blur and good colors. Taking photos from a tour bus on my trip turned out wonderful as well. Using it on my cruise from the tender boats was great. Despite traveling at a decent pace the shots never blurred, even when capturing fast moving settings like the boat wake or other boats.-- Bonuses --Works decently in low light situations. Sometimes the auto mode isn't exact and you need to take a second photo, but it works well 99% of the time. I was very impressed by turning off the flash and letting auto mode adjust the ISO in low light situations - those pictures came out great! I played with the ISO in manual mode a fair bit as well, and you can do some fun stuff in low light. It isn't going to be a DSLR, but shoot, for what this camera is and what it costs, it does well.Macro mode! It is killer on this camera. Extreme closeups come out nice and crisp.Rechargeable battery. I know this is virtually standard these days, but just in case you didn't notice it. It's really handy.I was able to purchase a high speed SD card for very cheap online (newegg), and expand my storage up to 8GB. This worked out well, and offloading pictures is nice and quick.All in all, if you're in the market for a decent point and shoot, this just might be the camera for you. I shopped through a ton of cameras, and then narrowed it down to about 15 for detailed review. This one came out as the winner in my book, and I'm very satisfied with my purchase.There are several other great cameras out there though, so do your research and read reviews, especially if you're after certain features. All I can do is share my experience with this particular camera, and in this case, it was outstanding. So I hope that helps in some regard.Cheers, and good luck!", "Date": "December 22, 2009"}, {"Title": "Surprisingly disappointed", "Author": "Burning Water", "ReviewID": "R3I1MC20LWQZSJ", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I'm a semi-professional photographer who's been using Nikon cameras and products for several years with zero complaints.  I purchased this camera to have something more portable for snapshots of friends and family.  My faith in Nikon was misplaced and I've found myself sorely wishing that I had gone to a brick and mortar store to test-drive a few small cameras.  I admit that it's quite possible that I'm jaded and spoiled after having shot with a D200 and D700 for years, but the picture quality of this camera is incredibly dismal, the build quality is so-so, and the speed of operation is also incredibly disappointing.If you like to use a flash a lot and aren't really concerned about the quality of your pictures, this camera might be acceptable to you.  But if you are somewhat technically savvy when it comes to cameras, you should be aware that the 12 megapixels and ISO 6400 capability do NOT translate into even marginally acceptable picture quality.  The sensor in this camera is really from the bottom of the barrel, and after having used it for awhile, I was very disheartened to discover that my iphone actually takes better quality pictures than this camera.  Additionally, start-up is surprisingly slow, auto-focus is only quick in really bright light and I've had a few problems transferring files from the camera to my computer (issues with both speed and glitches).On the bright side, the video quality, although limited by the poor sensor quality is not half-bad.  Although I have occasionally had issues with the sound quality (choppy sound sometimes occurs when recording movies).My advice is to shop around before purchasing this camera.  I paid $200 for mine two months ago, and in spite of trying to like and use the camera, I've regretted it ever since.", "Date": "February 13, 2010"}, {"Title": "Best Nikon Yet!", "Author": "R.

I have a very fast child and all the cameras I have used until now were too slow and I was missing shots. For this feature most people referred me to a DSLR. And I am sure they are right about that being the very best option. But when I asked them if they took their camera with them they confessed having missed opportunities because their DSLR was too bulky to throw in a purse. With my limited budget (around $200) and need for portability I was persistent in looking for a point and shoot. In the tests I did there is a difference among the point and shoots and I think this one is among the best for speed. I relied heavily on a british camera review site which I highly recommend to other seekers - cameras.co.uk. This site rates many cameras according to shutter lag. I am very pleased.

K. Richardson", "ReviewID": "R2TMOI6M3EM8VO", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "I'm disappointed with this camera that's supposed to be the best Coolpix to date at the very least. But it really takes a while to save the pic and be ready to take the next. So long that I don't get good pics of my daughter cause she's waited too long. With the Coolpix P2 it was snap snap snap snap. Now with the S640 it's snap wait wait wait a bit (I could have taken 3 additional pics in the time). I reduced the MB of the pics from 12 to 5 hoping it would save the pic faster but not much improvement.There is another annoying delay if you've selected the auto mode. Although you're ready to snap, the camera hasn't yet decided what mode it should switch to - portrait, close up, night, backlight, etc. So my daughter is posing and I'm snapping and wondering why the picture is not happening and then I realise it's still 'deciding'.  What's the sense in having the fastest start-up (<7 seconds) but in between the pics you have to wait 10+ seconds to take the next pic.Also, I'm not a camera/picture specialist - just an amateur who likes to take pics of my daughter. Somehow though the quality of the pic on the display is not as nice as on my P2 - pics seem dark and I'm using the automatic settings.I'm frustrated and disappointed because I thought that it would be an improvement on my P2 but it's just stressing me out.I love the pink and I'm not girly - the pink is a lovely dusty rose color. The size is fantastic too - nice small fit. But I feel to cry about the delay in saving and mode selection.

My philosophy regarding cameras is located here and I will not repeat it (at [...] and select \"equipment\" from the home page). I will start with my negative points. 1) it is not an indoor sports camera 2)It does not have a manual override; however, the scenes can be selected with an eye towards min depth of field (portate mode) sports for fastest shutter etc. 3) no ability to create raw files. It was a challenge to take an indoor photo without flash at 1600 ASA with a decent shutter speed but it can be done.  The time between image capture and operator view of the image is in multiple seconds and seems long.Positive points - 1) nice form factor, light and small, 2) relatively quick to startup (less than 2 sec) to shoot if in automatic mode, reasonable quality (see gallery of unretouched photos at the [...] equipment selection and then the \"here\" hot word under point and shoot discriminators).
