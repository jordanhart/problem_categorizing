Daftardar", "ReviewID": "R15X4I9852778I", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "In fact, I have a small story to tell before I review this camera (Kodak M1033).I used to have Kodak EasyShare DX7590. That camera was producing beautiful and great quality pictures. I still have this camera but I wanted to buy a small camera that will fit my pocket. So I bought Sony W-170 CyberShot, but I sold it after one week because I didn't like the pictures at all. The pictures were not clear and the general quality is too low.In that moment, I returned to the shopping mall and reviewed all the small cameras they have and after a careful consideration, I decided to buy Kodak EasyShare M1033.Kodak EasyShare M1033 gave me the quality I want with reasonable price. I noticed that all Kodak products are delivering the same great quality and sharp pictures.Kodak M1033 has different modes that you can select depending on the situation. I used the beach mode when I went with my family and the pictures were so great and the color the blue water was so nice in the pictures. Even my family couldn't believe that this camera was able to capture such pictures with that great quality.The overall experience with this camera is GREAT and I strongly recommend it for anyone wants a small camera with high quality and resolution pictures. This camera is easy to use with its programmed modes that provide various types of pictures in different situations.Regards,Yousef", "Date": "July 13, 2008"}, {"Title": "A Surprizing Find", "Author": "Bernie J. Lofaso", "ReviewID": "R17BCWFSW7LWEU", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Having owned digital cameras for nearly 10 years now, I'm no stranger to them. I currently own a somewhat old Sony 5mp \"prosumer\" camera (which still takes very nice photos) and an 8mp Canon DSLR. Since the latter weighs nearly 4 lb. with my favorite lens on it and the former is not exactly compact either, I went shopping for a reasonably good quality and not too expensive pocket camera. After reading some reviews I was interested in a Fujifilm J10, which while inexpensive seemed pretty decent and got good marks for image quality. I treked down to a local Best Buy to check it out. While the J10 does look like a very nice camera for the money, I was not quite enthused about what I perceived as a sluggish response, and the camera buttons seemed a bit clunky. I decided while I was there to look around at other brands and models while I was there. That was when the Kodak M1033 caught my eye. I thought it was a very attractive looking camera. Part of this was due to the fact that it had little in it's finish that would attract finger prints ... something that drives me crazy. Upon picking up the camera I then noticed it was a Kodak and was a little surprized. To be honest, I've not perceived Kodak cameras as being of particular quality or performance. Upon playing with the controls I was immediately impressed with the build quality and the feel of the buttons. Discovering the joystick control ... I was off to the races. Most of the camera operation was fairly intuitive and I found the joystick a much more convinient selection method than the multi-way controls used in most pocket cameras. I was also impressed by the quick responses of the camera ... start-up time, shutter lag, magnification and image scrolling on playback were all quite good, particularly by pocket camera standards. I decided to wait and research the camera some more and then once I found out about the HD video modes with MPEG-4 compression, I decided to give it a try. After several days of using the camera, I'll say that overall I'm fairly impressed with it. The image quality doesn't compare with my DSLR but even though shots in low light are frequently a bit noisy and blurred (again, by DSLR standards), they look pretty good compared to other pocket cameras I've seen reviewed. With 10mp you can afford some blurriness which you'll never see unless you enlarge quite a bit. While full manual modes are not present on this camera, it does give some manual control and has several features that surprized me on this type of camera (spot metering and histogram to name two). On one hand the high ISO settings can make for pretty blotchy and/or noisy images, but again, I've seen far worse in camera reviews of shirt pocket cameras and I must say I'm surprized that these images seem usable even at such high settings. I'm just a bit embarrassed to admit that I've grown accustomed to shooting most of my shots in fully-automatic \"dummy\" mode. I can't complain about the results and should I need a little more control, to some extent I have it. All in all I'd have to give this little bugger a big thumbs up.", "Date": "July 29, 2008"}, {"Title": "First small camera", "Author": "Colin \"iworkout2\"", "ReviewID": "R5UDCOBR9TUC8", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Small camera I bought and took on a vacation to Las Vegas and Route 66 in Arizona. I carried it in a carrier hooked to my belt. I took over 400 pictures and only 2 were discarded. (I didn't wait for the camera to focus) Very quick to turn on, and at 10 mp and a 2 gig card I had plenty of room on the card. Very sharp pictures.

Auerbach", "ReviewID": "R11SDU3S1BZ6NG", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I bought this as a back up to my bulky full size digital camera. It is great for vacation and you can easily slip it into a pocket. No need to worry about a neck strap or large bag to carry it. The picture quality is about what I expected and occasionally exceeds my expectations. As with most small cameras low light situations are basically out of the question. The flash will compensate for short range images, but don't expect to catch any movement from a distance at night or a poorly lit room. It does great outdoors though. The panoramic stitching impressed me by seamlessly bringing together 3 pictures. The optical zoom isn't that great (I'm so used to the 12x on my other camera) but for general snapshots it should be just fine, and with 10mp you have plenty of room to crop and zoom after the fact. Also, the big 720p video selling point is, in fact, 720p but again don't expect to use it in anything less than perfect lighting conditions. The regular 640x480 does a great job though.Overall a great buy with a reasonable price, if only for its tiny size.", "Date": "May 9, 2008"}, {"Title": "Great Little Camera", "Author": "Leighanna Barr \"Peejthejeep\"", "ReviewID": "R17XEI27KQX0A0", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I bought this camera to replace my Kodak EasyShare C530 5mp.

I had actually been shopping it for over a month before I caught the bargain I'd been waiting for on AMAZON.  I have always endorsed and recommended Kodak camera products.  I feel they have the best record of quality over time and have never failed to deliver what I have been looking for.  I've never been a big supporter of Sony cameras or HP cameras, just because I feel that they are companies doing more that what they can to go outside their scope of industry and are just looking to get \"a piece of the pie\" on other \"hot\" terriories.  I have seen the capabilities of some of their products and have always found a Kodak that not only matches the spec, but in many cases supercedes it.  I was a photographer in High School, so I am not very unfamiliar with photography and I hope my review will help you in choosing your next camera.  For the record, I have been waiting a long time to upgrade, my last camera was Kodak CX7530 5.0 MP camera that served me faithfully and continues to do so when I don't use my new m1033.The m1033 is extremely compact that carries a huge screen compared to many like models with similar capabilities.  I love being able to see a picture on the screen and know what I may be missing before I press the shutter.  It also has the Kodak smart capture feature, which allows for the camera to be able to dictate to the user what type of setting to snap the picture in rather than have the user choose from its mulitiple variations.  I have found the smart feature to be accurate for the most part, about 8 times out of 10, which isn't too bad; however it doesn't help to have this feature on when you are trying to snap a picture in \"the moment.\"  The screen may look like the picture is coming off blurry or grainy, don't worry, this is natural and once you have pressed the shutter, you will see your picture the way you want it to print out.  The other feature that jumps at you right away is the stabilization feature.  While this particular model does not carry the IS (Image Stabilization) technology, it does have a built-in indicator which tells you how steady the camera was when the picture was taken.  There is a green hand with motion bars for steady, a yellow hand with motion bars for in-between and a red hand with motion bars to let the user know the camera was not steady at all when the picture was taken.  I like the feature, however it was not always accurate and on some occassions (very few) I was perfectly still and yet received a red hand.  At which point I felt that perhaps by resetting it (turning it off and then on again) the system would restore the lens.  Oddly enough, I was right.  This may seem aggravating to most, but unless you are a photo journalist who needs his camera to be ready to fire at any given moment, this shouldn't be too much trouble the one time you may have to do this as the camera loads extremely fast.  Other features include the ability to e-mail a photo from the camera once you dock it or connect it to your computer.  The m1033 also has the Kodak Perfect Touch feature, which basically touches up your pictures immediately after being taken in order to minimize the amount of editing on a PC.  The video shoots extremely well and I was able to view videos at a 720p capacity on a 19\" monitor just fine.  If you are desperate to have your PHOTO camera shoot in higher resolution so you won't have to buy a camcorder, then this camera is not for you.  The last feature I was very impressed by was the stitch feature.  This allows you to take a panoramic photo by taking three individual photos and then stitching them together at their seam points.  I thought this was a nice feature for the times when one picture just doesn't say 1,000 words but instead 333.  You'll find this feature particularly handy at football and baseball games as well as other sporting events.  The only thing I will warn you about is that it is intended for still-frames so don't expect to capture action in this mode, you will only be able to get what remained still throughout shoot.The review asks for best out of five stars, but if I had to give it a TRUE rating (best out of 10), this would be an 8.5 out 10.  Excellent point-and-shoot camera with some great features.  It is super-slim and is about the size of a Motorola Q or Samsung Blackjack.  I recommend this to anyone looking to upgrade but doesn't want to spend too much money.  If you have to spend more than $150 on this particular model I recommend you go for the m1093 IS, which is better than the m1033 on some aspects.  No matter which model you go with, you will always find that Kodak does not disappoint.", "Date": "January 11, 2009"}, {"Title": "HD Video in Your Pocket == Awesome", "Author": "FromPersonalExperience", "ReviewID": "RC27MARPBT3UA", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Here's my backstory: I bought a rather expensive Sony camcorder with photo capabilities thinking \"this will help me chronicle my adventures while I'm in Europe.\" This turned out to be one of the biggest mistakes I have ever made! Despite being such an expensive camcorder, the Hard Drive Disk Sony model took grainy footage and to put a sour cherry on top, the photos were terrible! I returned the piece of crap. Since the $443 camcorder had such crap quality, I thought about going all in. Let's get an HD camcorder, but we all know that requires a lot of money. Fortunately I found a much better alternative. Kodak M1033! I have reviewed footage from this Kodak camera and I it is 10x better than the Sony camcorder that I had. It features 720HD video capabilities and I must say this is an amazing deal. It totally beats an upscale Sony camcorder AND it takes great pictures. Definitely worth it if you're into making decent home movies. If you just want a solid digital camera, you can score with a canon powershot which sells at a price a little cheaper than this.

I'm tired of gadgets that try to look powerful by being hard to use. I want a camera that is--dare I say it--like my iPod.Good: Ease of use, picture quality, video quality.Bad: Battery life, occasional freezing (?!)This camera really is easy to use, but it doesn't sacrifice features or power to do it (sure, it's no SLR). It's a great pocket camera.I'm pleased with the picture quality. The automatic mode displays the icon of the most appropriate \"specialty mode\" as it takes the picture, perhaps educating you for future shots. Colors look good. Flash is good for a camera this size.I'm pleased with the video quality. I saw the review where someone was complaining about video quality--I'd have to guess that he's shooting in low light. What can you expect with a lens the size of a dime? I'm using it as a stand-in to replace my failing Mini-DV camcorder. DV is better, sure, but even as picky as I am, I'm willing to use this for video in the meantime. It does stabilization in 480p (not in 720p). It also has standard and high quality video modes (not sure what other reviewers used). I recommend high quality 480p with stabilization.The battery doesn't seem to last long. I rotate through my batteries pretty frequently (once a week with \"moderate\" use--what's moderate?). I couldn't make an entire day at a theme park visit on one battery. Have extras.Mine has frozen up a couple of times. Talk about weird. I just popped out the battery and put it back. Nothing was lost. All was fine. Just weird.I'm willing to change/charge the batteries more frequently for a CLEAN DESIGN and GREAT PICTURES.

Christiansen \"Dave\"", "ReviewID": "R3N134MFZ6UTZ", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "I picked the M1033 up at a local Best Buy, intending to replace my decrepit 3.3Megapixel Olympus.  I wanted a small form-factor camera with high resolution, and passable video I could use so my wife wouldn't have to lug around our video camera for occasional use.At first, I was excited, but the glamor wore off quickly.  I would not recommend the device without SIGNIFICANT CAVEATS.  Read on...* Form factor: the camera is friggin tiny.  That's excellent -- what I was looking for.* Still image quality: once you turn OFF the digital zoom, the image quality is as good as one would expect from a ten megapixel camera.  However, if you zoom all the way in on the image (on your computer), you'll see compression artifacts because it exports JPEG files, rather than PNG or TIFF.  This dims my otherwise stellar recommendation.* Video quality is HORRIBLE, especially in low light.  I was SHOCKED at how awful the video is.  Why would I take 720p high-definition video if the image quality is noisy and grainy?  IF VIDEO IS EVEN REMOTELY A PURCHASING CONCERN FOR YOU, YOU WILL NOT BE SATISFIED WITH THIS PRODUCT.* Video format is Quicktime MOV.  If you have a Mac, this is no big deal.  For the rest of us, this is a pain.  EDITING QUICKTIME MOVIES REQUIRES PURCHASING ADDITIONAL SOFTWARE.* The unit's basic layout could stand significant improvement.  For example, the position of the lens makes it a natural place to hold the camera, which is okay when it's turned off.  However, once you hit the power button, it's very easy to brush the lens with your fingertips.Further, the EasyShare connector (NOTE: proprietary USB plug) is located very close to the tripod shoe connector.  This means that you have to choose between installing a quick-release shoe for your tripod and plugging it into USB.  I can understand this (somewhat), as the camera just isn't very big and you have to put these things somewhere.Still, together, this is very disappointing.  I'm imagining that I'd have to clean the lens A LOT due to fingerprints.* the buttons on the top row are easy to hit at the same time.  This resets the camera to factory configuration.  I discovered this six seconds after handing it to my wife.  Fortunately, it's easy to reconfigure, but I don't intend to reset the clock on the thing every few weeks.* volume control for the unit appears to be universal -- the sounds the camera makes are controlled by the same logic that limits sound of video playback.  This control is buried in the setup system.  So, when I turn the camera's insipid sound effects down to the minimum, I can't easily hear the video soundtrack even on maximum playback volume.  Poor design choice.* joystick-stud is difficult to use for some people.  Like my wife, or me when I get excited.  Pushing the button in (ENTER) often causes the stick to go in one direction or another.  Imagine doing this on a very cold day.* Digital zoom RUINS the image quality.  Make SURE to turn it off or you'll be wondering why you bought a 10MP camera.SUMMARY:  This camera is for you if you can meet ALL of the following criteria:1. you want very high-resolution images and small form-factor2. you can tolerate extremely poor quality video (or don't need video at all)3. you have a way to edit (or don't need to edit) the quicktime movies the camera produces in such low quality.4. you seldom or never use a tripod5. you have tiny, agile fingers and never take pictures in cold weather6. you can remember to immediately turn off the digital zoom...otherwise, seek a different product.", "Date": "October 6, 2008"}, {"Title": "My Favorite Camera", "Author": "L.

We wanted a small camera that we could easily fit in a pocket, purse, etc. so that we could have it with us for more of life's events and, therefore, take more pictures.  We've had a larger \"prosumer\" model for years that takes great pictures but we rarely had the camera with us for those spontaneous \"in the moment\" photo opportunities because the camera was just too big to lug around.  So the size of the Kodak M1033 was one of the primary factors in our purchase.  Of course, the picture quality was also a concern.  With the decent reviews the camera received, we decided to give it a try.In short, we love it!!!  It is small enough to fit in any pocket which means we can carry it with us whenever and wherever we choose.  For our purposes, it takes great pictures.  And it has great features for such a small and inexpensive camera.  I'm sure professionals would (and do) find fault with the picture quality.  However, years from now when I'm looking through pictures I was able to get because I happened to have my Kodak M1033 with me at just the right place and time, I doubt I'll care much if the picture quality wasn't technically on point due to the saturation of grey around the edges when the picture is cropped and magnified 100 X's.

It's a great pocket camera.I'm pleased with the picture quality. The automatic mode displays the icon of the most appropriate \"specialty mode\" as it takes the picture, perhaps educating you for future shots. Colors look good. Flash is good for a camera this size.I'm pleased with the video quality. I saw the review where someone was complaining about video quality--I'd have to guess that he's shooting in low light. What can you expect with a lens the size of a dime? I'm using it as a stand-in to replace my failing Mini-DV camcorder. DV is better, sure, but even as picky as I am, I'm willing to use this for video in the meantime. It does stabilization in 480p (not in 720p). It also has standard and high quality video modes (not sure what other reviewers used). I recommend high quality 480p with stabilization.The battery doesn't seem to last long.

Since we're talking about cameras here, if a device has say, easy steps to change flash settings, that is no good. The steps themselves are easy, yes, but it is the necessity of steps which faults it.Thus, I may declare that the Kodak M1033 is wonderfully step free. Powering up the camera is a one button affair, no jog wheels to confuse. One button brings up the camera modes and the same one button confirms the selection. Plus, if you do bring up the menu, the camera helpfully hides all of the options that are not used by the active mode. When my father first opened the box on Christmas day, it was completey intuitive for him I use. I'm making a note here, huge success.  (Of course, I did cheat a little by opeining the box the day before and changing all of the initial settings.)The camera does still hold some surprises for power users as well however. Manual picture taking has some fine options and features to be found, including a large ISO range for a camera of this range, useful color options, and for once a surprisingly accurate auto-white balancer.I do however knock the camera down one star for a few complaints I had as a power user. If you are shopping for yourself and consider yourself to be a casual user, then just consider this a five star review and move on.The digital zoomis completely horiffic and will destroy a d picture it is used in, even at low levels. The menu has an option to permanantly turn the digital zoom off. Use it. Although the camera claims to shoot HD video, video in any resolution looks completely unwatchable.

It's still in great shape, with whatever small glitches I blame on the refurbished factor. I've never owned a Canon, but I know they are all high quality cameras, but I feel like you can make this Kodak work in wonderful ways.Photos: The pictures from this camera can be awesome if you use the right settings. The SMART mode is helpful especially if you're trying to take a nice quick picture. It has auto focus for macro or landscape, low lighting, etc. But I've found that under the SMART setting, you get really noisy photos under low light. So in order to get a nice shot in that case, you'd have to use one of the Scene modes or the Program mode. I love messing around with the Program mode because you can get all the settings however you want and your pictures can come out great. I would even compare some of the pictures with some DSLR photos. You just have to know how to take them. This Kodak camera came with a mini tripod which I've used on occasion, and it's really nifty! It has adjustable legs, and I've been able to take some beautiful long-time exposure pictures of scenery in low light. I wish I could share some of them here. The hardware is easy to use, however, some people have trouble distinguishing the shoot button from the power button when I ask them to take a picture for me. The flash is bright but good. The screen is very nice, bright and clear - I've had a screen protector on for most of the time, but overall the camera is extremely sturdy. I've definitely dropped it a few times, even on concrete, and there's barely any damage except for tiny scratches.Video: The quality is pretty good, it can record in 720px which is HD. I really like the sound quality from the mic. I've recorded some artists at concerts and it sounds pretty good. Sometimes the focus goes in and out, but there are settings if you want auto, still, or continuous focus, which helps out a lot.Battery life: I haven't had a problem with the original battery. I still use the same one. And like I've mentioned, I've taken this camera to concerts and I've been able to record a good amount of footage on one battery recharge.

I received the first as a Christmas gift and I believe the purchase price was near $130 at the local big box store. After a year or so of heavy use but lots of care, the camera could be turned on, but immediately turned itself off, and without the telephoto working. The warranty had expired. After switching batteries with no luck and searching the 'net for an answer, it became clear that this is a common problem with this camera, as several reviewers have reported. I also had the same bad experience with Kodak's customer service reps as other reviewers. Of all the companies I've ever dealt with via phone, they are the worst. Enough said. So, why did I buy another M1033? The big positive reason is that this camera is the easiest to use of the other major brands I tried. It's just more intuitive for me. Other reasons are, I bought a great Panasonic Lumix at over $250, dropped it in the water and it was gone. I needed another camera soon, so found a used M1033 on this site for under $60 with a return guarantee if it wasn't acceptable. I was more used to the Kodak than the Lumix and the price was right, so here I am with another one. I would never have paid full price, but a bargain is a bargain, so we'll see if I wasted my money again. Bottom line is this: If you can get one used and at a very low price, it's worth it.

I loved my 8 megapixel easy share that had great photo and video quality. After dropping the first Kodak onto cement, I decided to replace it with another easy share with more mega pixels and this camera was my first choice at the time. Right away I noticed that the video quality is horrible. I stopped taking any video within the first week. The camera worked okay for the first few months. I take probably around 40 pictures a week of my kids, so we aren't talking a lot of heavy use either. The picture quality was pretty good for a small camera, but then the problems started. Within the first 2 months I had a couple instances of the camera \"locking\" just as many other reviewers have mentioned. I was always able to reset without issues. Then it started happening more frequently. When the camera does work, it often gives me an error stating that the memory card needs to be formatted to work properly and in order to do that it wants to erase all the pictures I have taken with this camera that are already on the card. I find nothing more frustrating than taking a few pictures in the morning only to turn my camera on in the afternoon and it tells me that the card needs to be formatted. I know it works, I just used it a few hours before that! I dealt with the issues since I have 2 year old twins and not a lot of time to go to the store to look for a new digital camera that actually works. I've given up after a year. Now the camera is permanently locked with the lens out, black screen...no power...and a battery that has charged for the last 2 hours and refuses to turn on. It's going in the trash on my way out of work today and I'll be getting myself a Canon Powershot like the one I use at work that takes beautiful pictures and gives me no issues whatsoever.

My original review was just about a year ago and I dislike this camera more so now.Below is my original review.  I've actually downgraded this camera to one star because Amazon won't let me go any lower.  I have now lost more pictures than I can remember - hopefully I downloaded them before this piece of junk died for the 4th time.  I will leave my original post in below but I cannot stress how awful this turd of a camera is - sad, sad, sad.This camera is very easy to use and takes good pictures and video when it actually works.  The smart features helps even a novice like me take nice clear pictures with little to no red eye pictures.  It is small and looks nice too.Then the bad -- I had the camera for about 3 months when it started.  I had the exact same issue that some others wrote about - I wished I would have read more reviews before getting this camera but my husband wanted a Kodak since it is USA made.  After about 3 months of use - not a lot of use, mind you - the camera lens would not retract back into the camera and it wouldn't hold a charge.  I got a new battery thinking that was it - nope.  I ended up sending it back to Kodak.  The 1st time it went back, I reported the issue online and was able to return it without having to call customer service.  Since it only worked for about 1 week after I got it back, I had to call the 800 customer service number.  Not fun times.  Kodak - made in the USA - appears to have outsourced their customer service to another country.  I had a lot of trouble trying to explain that it still was having the same issues even though I had just gotten it back, sigh.  Finally I said, please just let me return it for servicing.  Lots of quiet on the other end and me saying, hello, hello, are you still there ?  Finally the man on the phone agrees to let me send it back for servicing for the 2nd time - that took more than 20 minutes phone time - and I sent it back again.  The group that serviced it was very responsive and sent it back within a week - but having this happen again for the 3rd time - same problem - is why I say no to this camera.

I'm a previous owner of the cannon digital elph 4mp camera that finally croaked on me recently after 4+ years of use.  The picture quality of the m1033 varies greatly depending on the situation, from absolutely terrible in low light to amazing in brightly lit scenes.The different modes provide a decent amount of control to how the camera takes and processes the image, however the 'smart' mode is absolutely horrid in low light situations and fumbles to find the correct setting to take a picure with, especially if you're not using a flash, something my old cannon would excel in (taking pics in low light w/out flash). The scene and Programmable modes provide deeper control but the menu system seems to get in the way of quickly programming it for a specific shot, for example, there's no quick way to adjust exposure level, iso, macro, etc. which out going through its onscreen menu.Note that there is no manual viewfinder on this camera, so in bight sun, you'll be straining to see the screen to see what you're taking a pic of.This camera is lacking one major feature that was almost a deal breaker, the lack of compression control of the jpegs produced.  Granted my old cannon only had a few settings for this (small, normal, fine, superfine, etc) but to me this is a huge plus for the canon system.  Kodak just uses whatever jpeg compression it feels is best and gets praise for \"only using 1.5mb for and image instead of 3mb for this other camera\" (read that in another review).  Which is ridiculous, there are definitely times when you want to be able to control the level of compression in the final jpeg image, sacrificing disk space for a much higher quality image.The easyshare software is bloated and clunky, just like most camera software, it wants to manage every document on your computer for you and wash your laundry and feed your kids.. well guess what kodak, there are some things I've already got software for, so butt out! Or at least give me a lighter version of your software to just facilitate transferring without loading this behemoth program every time, geesh. By default it will nuzzle itself into your systray and stay running on your pc 24-7 just in case you might plug in your camera and assumes that you are too dumb to *gasp* click an icon.  This is another peeve of mine about camera companies and their crap software, consider for a second kodak, that some people *gasp* would prefer to not use your software for picture management and instead use google's picasa or something, in which case, just provide us with the simple option of a transfer only program that would allow us to dump our photos into wherever we want without running your bloatware service in the background hogging up vast amounts of memory.  Granted you can turn off the service and start it manually but there is no way to transfer photos from your camera without loading this giant software suite, which is annoying.Ok, ranted a bit there but if you're looking for a camera that works, takes great pics in well lit situations and is cheap as hell for a 10mp camera, its great.  If you're a cannon user, you'll be disappointed with the quality.Last thing, the HD video feature is AWESOME!  It does have a stabilization feature at a lower rez but not at 720p HD video.  But either way the video works greats, takes great 720p videos, again in well lit situations for best quality.  But the point is, the hd video option is very handy, throw in an 8GB SDHC card and you can take several hours of video on this thing, very cool.", "Date": "February 28, 2009"}, {"Title": "Best (and cheapest) way to create HD Video", "Author": "Amazon Customer", "ReviewID": "R34DS2ZEWJUUL9", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I am going to focus on the HD video capability of this camera.

I could not even turn it off.  Removing and replacing the battery solved the repeated problem for a few weeks, but then even that stopped helping.  The camera was inoperable.  In less than two months of use I had a brand new camera that would not work! It does come with a one year warranty, so after an hour long conversation with a Kodak customer service agent who was difficult to understand (I think she was in India), they are taking the camera to service or replace with a refurbished one. I hope it solves the problem, but seeing online how many others have experienced it I fear the whole design may be flawed somehow...In short, my experience has been that it is a great camera when it works, but its unreliability makes it a poor choice...", "Date": "February 20, 2009"}, {"Title": "Pretty good", "Author": "Matthew J.

The image quality is ok, the size is compact, and it's great having HD video capability in my pocket.That being said, there is a serious flaw in the firmware that puts you at risk of losing picture and movie files stored on your SD card, particularly if you are a Mac user.It should be noted that there are also some minor operational issues that myself and others have experienced, most commonly that of the camera locking up on occasion. This has happened to me perhaps 5-7 times over the past few months and is easily remidied by removing and replacing the battery. Another flaw is that now and then, a completed movie is unplayable on the camera, yet is playable on the Kodak HDTV dock or computer software such as VLC.The BIG DANGER, though, is in utilizing a card reader (as many of us do) in order to transfer your pictures to your computer. On a Mac, the \"Finder\" (file browser) inserts many hidden files on your SD card, which you can see if you look at the card on a Windows computer or in the Terminal on Mac. These files evidently give the camera MAJOR problems when you insert it back in the camera. However, the problems do not seem to manifest themselves until you shoot a movie. I've had the camera corrupt every single picture and movie on the card through this design flaw. Another time, I got lucky and only about 70% of the files were corrupted.This is a SERIOUS problem that Kodak needs to correct in a firmware update. My Kodak Z740 never had this problem.As a workaround in the meantime, I highly reccommend using a free little utility called CleanUp smb mess, available at [...] . It removes all of the hidden files put on the card by your mac. I keep it in my dock and use it all the time! Once you drag your disk over it's icon and eject it, you won't have any problems with corrupt files.

I opened the cover by unscrewing the little screws all around the camera. When I opened it, the zoom button fell right off.
