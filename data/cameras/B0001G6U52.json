{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Superb Digital Camera", "Author": "TuMahler", "ReviewID": "R3L7CM16E24XCX", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "After researching other cameras in its class including the Panasonic DMC-FZ10 and Konica Minolta DiMAGE Z2, I finally decided on the Canon S1 IS. Having taken a few hundred pictures with it, I am completely satisfied with my purchase.With this camera I have the flexibility to take pictures with point-and-shoot ease while also having plenty of manual capabilities available to take more artistic pictures. Although the camera has \"only\" 3.2 megapixels this is more than compensated for by the 10x optical zoom. With this zoom you simply don't need as many megapixels (although it would be nice) because you won't be cropping out as much of the picture. Instead of cropping out excess, you just zoom in while you are there and have a nice original to begin with. Furthemore, more megapixels don't necessarily mean a \"better\" picture. There are other factors like the lens, cmos, and other processing that will affect the image quality just as much as the megapixels if not more.Image stabilization is an awesome feature and until now has been reserved for the more expensive cameras. This feature definitely helps with the long zooms and low-light conditions. With the long zoom you can do shots where the primary object is very clear while the background is all blurry. This isn't as easy to do on cameras with less zoom.The physical layout and the menu interface are excellent. The placement of the buttons are very intuitive and the menu setup is among the best I've ever used on any electronic device. It allows me to use all the manual settings with ease and speed. I can't really think of any better way to set it up.Although the viewfinders tend to make images look like they are overexposed I think that as the viewfinder ages and dims (as any LCD will do over time) the picture will improve and not look as overexposed. So, I think it is excellent foresight on Canon's part to make the pictures seem overexposed. Personally, I don't find it to be a major issue because I view all the pics on my computer before deleting them anyway. The swiveling LCD is a feature that is indispensible. Not only does it protect the LCD if you flip it around, but you can take pictures of yourself (or others next to you) or and you take pictures at weird angles (such as close to the ground or high above a crowd) without contorting yourself.I don't find battery power to be an issue. Just get 2 or 3 sets of NiMH batteries and you should be fine for a long day of heavy shooting. Plus the fact that you can use AA instead of a proprietary module means you can use regular AA alkaline batteries in a pinch.The movie mode is great not only because of the high quality movies, but also because you can zoom while taking the movie. Most cameras will not let you zoom and you have to leave it where it is. The only downside is that you will need a high-speed compact flash card (like the Sandisk Ultra II) to take the highest quality movies. Slower cards can't keep up with the high amout of data being written.The focusing system is also great and not usually found on cameras at this level. You can move the autofocus box to any postion you want and set an autofocus lock so it doesn't change once you've set it. You can also use the manual focus if you can't get a good focus in low-light situations. There is a meter that pops up showing the approximate distance to the object that you want to focus to which is quite helpful. With the manual focus, I've been able to focus on any object without too much trouble.There are only 2 things I would like to see improved. One would be some sort of battery meter but it would be wildly inaccurate without some sort of proprietary battery (which they don't make you use) so I'm ok with them leaving that out. I would also like the lens cap to 'click' on instead of just sliding on. I understand why they made that decision though: they want the cap to slide off automatically when you turn it on which is a convenience so I don't have to take it off every time I turn it on. These are just minor suggestions and really just personal preference things. Otherwise, this camera is perfect for the price and what you get.I highly recommend this camera to anyone to both point-and-shoot people and people who want that along with some artistic flexibility. The feature set is unbeatable and the picture quality is amazing.[...]", "Date": "May 22, 2004"}, {"Title": "Canon Powershot S1 IS", "Author": "Fred Sgrosso", "ReviewID": "REFTAVNRGVHLV", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I have used the Canon Powershot IS 1 for over a month and have shot many 100's of images with it.The good points:*Produces beautiful images under most conditions.*The image stabilization system works very well. You are able to take sharp pictures down to 1/6 sec in the wide angle position.*I used it exclusively at Disney World for the Epcot International Flower Show and thought the night exposures were wonderful. No flash, just hand held photography.*The movie mode works well under the difficult lighting conditions encountered at the night time parade at Magic Kingdom.*The color saturation was beautiful. I used the Program mode mostly at ISO equivalent of 100 and the Vivid setting.*The noise was minimal with the 100 ISO setting. The advantage is higher shutter speeds to stop the action.*I was able to set the depth of field in Aperture mode for good garden bed shots.*The 10/1 zoom is incredible!The bad points:*The Electronic viewfinder is terrible! The resolution, sharpness, color accuracy and saturation of the finder make you wonder what Canon was thinking of. An optical viewfinder is 100% better.*The finder blanks out when going from dark to bright outside subjects, making fast picture taking impossible under many instances.*The resolution is so bad that it is difficult to see if the focus is right on. It usually was.*The Canon A-70 is a better camera for faster picture taking. However, the anti- shake and 10/1 zoom override all other considerations for me.*The LCD viewer on the back of the camera is useless in the bright light and its color accuracy is terrible too. I have taken many beautiful sunsets and you cannot see the red sun in the viewfinder or on the monitor. HOWEVER the resultant images were spectacular when viewed on the computer screen.*The battery consumption seemed to be higher than the A-70 but I did not do a very accurate test. I used two sets of NiMH batteries in a full day of shooting at Epcot. However I was shooting in movie mode some of the time and using a 1 GB flash cards to hold the many images. All the images were taken with the best quality jpg settings.The bottom line is that the camera is very good for most picture taking opportunities, but is no good for fast moving objects such as flying birds.Forget what you do not see in the viewfinder or the viewer and shoot away.The big thing here is to have faith!I give the camera 4 out of 5 points.NEW! I just had to change the Time/Date battery. My instruction manual is WRONG!!

It arrived even before Amazon said it would!  This is my first digital camera and so far I am very pleased with it.  I wanted a camera that would take good travel pictures and images of grandchildren who often don't like cameras near them.  I expect to print the better pictures as either 4x6 or 5x7 and occasionally 8x10s.  At first I was reluctant to consider 3.2MP cameras but my research showed that a figure of merit for a digital camera should actually be proportional to MP times the optical zoom factor squared.  This gives a heavy weighting to optical zoom (it's related to picture area) and it also means that you can avoid considerable cropping and wasting of MP.  That's why people are often surprised that this camera does so well against its higher MP competition.  It's also adequate for printing my size pictures. Unfortunately, most hand held 10X cameras used at maximum zoom also need to have a shutter speed of 1/400th of a second to avoid picture bluring caused by camera shake so that you can use this 10X feature only in bright sunlight, unless you support the camera.  The Canon S1's image stabilization system allows hand held pictures with much slower shutter speeds so it is useful more often.  I always leave it on and I've taken sharp pictures of ducks, birds, and, oh yes, our grandchildren at a playground.  Our daughter, who is a professional photographer, has even commented on the quality of these candid shots, something she did not do with my film camera with lower power zoom.  Independently, I also purchased a lightweight RipVan100 battery charger that can operate at overseas voltages and I carry around an extra set of charged NIMH AA batteries, just in case, although I've yet to need them.  Of course, in a pinch, I can always use universally available AA batteries, another feature of this camera.This camera, like all 10X zooms, uses an electronic viewfinder.  I find that it is hard to see well in bright sunlight (especially if I'm wearing sunglasses), even at maximum brightness setting.  Its resolution is also poor and the images often seem overexposed - but, and this is important, the images don't shake at 10X with the IS on! and the actual pictures are correctly exposed. The swiveling LCD screen grows on you and you can take pictures looking down at the camera at waist level.  The grandchildren may not even realize you are actually taking their picture, adding to the candid effect. I haven't found the lack of an autofocusing lamp to be a problem in dim light and you can always set the manual focus to about 8 feet (no zoom used) and everything from 4 feet to infinitity will be sharp.  (I got this tidbit from my research).After it was announced but before it was readily available the camera received so-so reviews but the recent user reviews from those who actually own and use one have been highly favorable and I agree with them.  It's well made, not too heavy, and the basics can be learned quickly.  Advanced users can find many features to investigate and I'm still learning how to use some of the exposure and focus lock modes for special cases.  I think that using the Auto mode (or the Program P mode) with IS on will work for most people, most of the time.  And, as an added bonus, you can even take movies (9 minutes/1GB at best quality) if you have a large memory.  I'm glad I discovered this \"fun\" camera.", "Date": "June 6, 2004"}, {"Title": "A delightful 10x stabilized zoom camera", "Author": "AP", "ReviewID": "R2EU5BKX7CHDYY", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "If you're like most people reading about the Canon Powershot S1, you've owned at least one or two digital cameras in the past, and chances are they've been the point and shoot kind. Now you'd like something with a few more manual controls.I'm not going to repeat what's in many other reviews here (an amazing 10x stabilized zoom ... you'll find it difficult to move back to a camera without this, generally excellent photo quality, and really compact - HOW do they fit this all in such a tiny package??) but instead I'd like to point out a few aspects of the camera that haven't been discussed that much in other reviews here.1. Get yourself a basic book on digital photography, so you will actually use some of the manual features of this camera. A $15 investment will give you better photo results within 30 minutes. Guaranteed. I got myself \"Digital Photography Pocket Guide\" from Amazon and I can already see the results in my photos.2. You'll love taking photos by using the viewfinder and not the LCD screen (which, at 1.5\", seems dismally small for a camera such as this) - the viewfinder is full of (though not cluttered with) details of your shot. Aperture, resolution, etc.3. The zoom control is tricky and takes time to get used to. A slight flick of the control and you have quickly moved beyond 5x magnification. You'll get the hang of it quickly, but be forewarned that you will be frustrated using the zoom initially.4. while other reviews have commented on using the Sandisk Ultra II card for taking VGA movies, I'm a little perplexed. While the movies are recorded on the card just fine, transferring them to my 2.4 gigahertz P4 machine leads to loss of data in the transfer and I am unable to view them properly. I am convinced there is an issue with the file transfer speed related to the camera's mechanism, NOT the memory card - for I have tried multiple ones. If you are buying this camera purely for this reason, do check this out carefully so that you too don't deal with the same problems (besides, the 512 MB card allows barely two minutes of 640x480 video.)5. The battery meter, which comes on only when the batteries are about to run out, could be better and indicate the approximate number of shots left. Come on Canon, you can do better...All in all, these are small deficiencies, certainly not glaring. I'm pleased with my stabilized zoom camera choice (the Panasonic FZ series were too bulky, the Minolta Dimage Z series too plastic feeling).One last point. Avoid the Canon PSC 70 carrying case made for this camera. Do read my review on that one should you purchase this camera.", "Date": "October 1, 2004"}, {"Title": "The S1 is simply a great Camera", "Author": null, "ReviewID": "R34T9VX3UCVXJG", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Hi,I just picked up my Canon S1 an simply love it.  The feel of it is very sturdy in your hands and feels well constructed.  The controls are very nicely placed.  You could easily handle this camera with one hand.  The zoom control is nice and fast, it takes a bit to get used to how touchy it can be, but easlily controlled once you get the hang of it.  The colors look great for outdoor shots, and indoor shots as well.  The AF(Auto Focus) seems to pick up indoors quite nicely, except for really low light areas, as i've usually had problems with my Fuji and other cameras, the Canon seems to focus more easily.  Plus you can see thru the LCD or viewfinder indoors as well very nicely.  You also get a 32mb CF with the camera, which is nice, but of course can fill up fast.  I suggest picking up at least a 256mb card, Costco has Sandisk 256 for around $41.  As for the menus, very easily done and easy to navigate thru.  I also love the MF (manual focus) on the S1.  You can't use it in Auto, but can in all other settings.  Where I couldnt focus with the AF, I could easlily focus with the MF.  I love the the LCD screen swivel capabilities also.  I'm looking forward to shooting above crowds while being able to see what im shooting at.  The 10X optical zoom is wonderful, and combined with the Image Stabilizer, is just near perfect.The cost of this 3.2 MP camera may seem alittle overpriced, but with the super bright LCD swivel screen (easily viewed in daylight), the Image Stailizer and the 10X optical zoom, and the 640 x 480 @ 30 fps video, \"automatic pop-up flash\", indoor low light capabilities and nice overall construction, plus a ton of other features, you will know its worth every penny.I almost went for the Minolta Z2, but the construction of that camera seemed very poor as the lens it self felt like it was going to fall out. Also when shooting video with the Minolta, the AF sound constantly was picked up in the video, making that a completely useless feature. Not so with the Canon S1, the USM zoom feature is that, Ultra Silent and so is the AF.  Not one sound is picked up while shooting video with the S1.  The Minolta did do great shots as well, but I finally went for the Canon for the sturdy construction and more readily available accessories, such as a underwater housing and optional remote control.Also as a side note, I really like the way you can customize the sounds in the camera under \"My Camera\".  Having a bird chird or dog bark, its just the icing on the cake.  I'm trying to make a Disney theme for my camera before vacation...I'm glad that companies such as Canon really know how to let the customer feel like its there very own camera, instead of just another cookie cutter gadget.Honestly, the only cons of this camera is maybe the price, and that is easlily justified with the attention to detail Canon has given this camera.I would highly recommend anyone to go out and give this camera a run though, you wont be disappointed.  Anyone can use this camera,very user friendly.  This camera will give you and your family many years of great memories...Thanks Canon...", "Date": "April 4, 2004"}, {"Title": "canon s1", "Author": "M. J. Brookbank", "ReviewID": "R2YMV8KYRNAUXF", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I bought this camera about a month ago after researching about a hundred different cameras. I was looking for something aroun 4-5 megapixels and $200-$300. This camera had lower megapixels (3.2) and it was at the top of my limits. I have one thing to say:I am glad I bought it.I received the camera in a matter of days from Amazon. That was normal for any order that I have placed with Amazon. Fast service. I received it just a few days before we left for a vacation to Disneyland in California so I did not have time to mess with it much, but I had time to play around with some of the features on the way down and I am impressed with this camera. I took pictures from day to night and from stills to shooting scenery out of our vehicle going 85 mph. Oops, I meant 75 mph officer. I would say that 99% of them came out great. I turned the video resolution down to the next one lower. A 512 MB CF card held about 12 minutes of video in one continuous shoot. That is probably the one feature that sold me on this camera. It did not have a limit on the minutes of continous video that could be shot. Other cameras had a 1.5-3 minute limit. I even used it to record half of a speech that I gave to a group to see how I presented myself. The camera was about 10 feet away and it still picked up my voice.The included AA alkaline batteries went dead within about a couple of hours. I bought two sets of rechargeables and found that one set lasted from 8 am to 10 pm at Disneyland. And I took alot of pictures and video! One day, I filled two 512 MB CF Cards and one 256 MB card. That is my only suggestion with this camera. Buy rechargeable batteries and a larger CF card if you are going to shoot video. I am planning to buy a 1 GB CF card later.When I bought it, I had the intention of selling it on ebay if I did not like it. No way. I am keeping it. Oh...one other thing in my favor, my daughter-in-law works as a photographer. She could show me things that camera would do that would have taken me quite awhile to figure out. She had a chance to use it and she was impressed with it.", "Date": "May 22, 2005"}, {"Title": "Very good but flawed", "Author": "L. A. Kane", "ReviewID": "R2Y9B2MSWL8QLF", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I've had this camera for about a year now and overall I'm still quite happy with my purchase. The drawbacks to this camera are common with all digital models I've tried and the picture quality is quite exceptional. Here's some more details...First the pros: It's very ergonomic, well-designed, and easy to use, even for first time digital camera owners like me. The 10x zoom works smoothly and very well. In good light the auto focus locks on quickly and the pictures turn out great, even when blown up as large as 8x10. With the right paper in the printer I cannot tell the difference quality-wise between these pix and my old film camera. I really like the flip out monitor screen for shooting pictures over crowds (e.g., at sporting events). It's very visible except in harsh, direct sunlight. The image stabilization works well, eliminating the need for a tripod in most situations. Sports mode gives clear action shots even when your subject is moving quickly. The self-timer is a nice feature too. Images are easy to download to the PC (with XP you don't even need the software that comes with the camera). The built in flash works better than I expected (up to ~10' away anyway).Now the cons: In low light situations the camera is extremely challenging to use. First off, the viewfinder is electronic and you cannot see what you are aiming at through it or the LCD monitor. In night or auto mode close-up pictures come out okay, you just have to guess at your aim. Longer shots do not work out well at all. At my son's Christmas concert last night I snapped 43 shots. 5 turned out well and 2 more were usable. The rest were garbage. Anytime the kids moved at all, the shot turned out blurry no matter what mode I had it set on (and I tried several), even with a tripod. This was extremely frustrating!! Further, like most digital cameras there is a significant delay between when you push the button and when the picture is actually snapped. It is very hard to take sports shorts unless you get lucky with timing or use the movie mode.Other stuff: you'll want to purchase a larger memory card. 32mb just doesn't cut it. I went with 256 and have been very happy. You also want to purchase some rechargeable batteries. This thing takes 4 AA's and really chews them up fast, especially when you are using the monitor and zooming a lot. Be sure to use the lens cap strap. It's designed to slide off when the camera is turned on (a convenience?) yet it tends to fall off at odd times since it does not snap in place. Don't buy the Cannon camera bag. It is poorly designed and overpriced.", "Date": "December 17, 2004"}, {"Title": "A very, very fine product", "Author": "I should be at the gym", "ReviewID": "R16SE04681SF1P", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Canon's done a great think with this product. This AA-ready, 10x-zoom product from a highly reputable camera manufacturer is a *highly*-recommended option for the serious amateur photographer. All in all, this camera is a GREAT value. If all consumer electronics companies held themselves up--for every product they made--to the basic dependability, overall ease of use, and impressive versatility of this camera, we'd all be in a much more affordable and hassle-free world relative to our mobile phones, DVRs, MP3 players, computers (especially), and everything else that sometimes beeps, whirrs, or flashes in our lives!If you're a \"point and shoot\" kind of photographer, however, move on: this PowerShot S1 is far more feature-rich, large, and heavier than you'll want.My review is based on 8 months of use. Heaven forbid that it stops working properly anytime soon--or even anytime within the next 5 years--but, thus far, I'm impressed. The camera accompanied me from the U.S. on a wintertime trip to England at the end of 2004 where it got a thorough workout and a great deal of manhandling, and held up through the entire vacation (and since then) solidly.*FEATURES: Manual over-ride exists for every key element: aperture, ISO speed (only a 50 to 400 range, however), flash, and even focus. Other features I find myself using a lot include switching the timer from 2 second delay (when I don't need to run in front of the camera to get into the photo myself) and 10 second delay (when I do), and over-riding the flash--that is, setting it from AUTO to ON, so that it will act as a \"fill flash\" even when the light meter is reading that the scene is bright because of background light. (There are two or three features I'll never use actually--and which I find rather silly, frankly--like \"sepia\" mode. Whatever.)*I.S.: Image stabilization is solid--not extra-ordinary, but good.*BATTERY: I have not had problems with battery depletion simply because I did what I'd recommend you do, too, if considering this product. I bought a AA recharger that I also cannot recommend highly enough (the \"Sony Power Charger with 4 Ni-MH AA Batteries\"--purchased via Amazon at the same time I purchased the Canon PowerShot) and 4 additional rechargeable AA's at my local K-Mart. So, as I shot, I simply kept 4 charged batteries at hand to swap in for the 4 temporarily exhausted ones if needed. I was never at *any* point without the ability to take photos for want of power. And then I recharged batteries, if needed or desired, during the night. Regardless, I found that 4 batteries lasted through *hundreds* of images with the camera set at the ideal setting for 4\"x6\" prints (150 dpi, I suspect, but I'm not sure off-hand), and in normal temperatures (more on that below).NOTE: far too many digital cameras require special batteries, sometimes proprietary (like Kodak for one). Setting aside the issue of batteries being rechargeable, the simple fact that this PowerShot takes AA's is fantastic. It means you will never have a difficult time finding power for your camera...as long as you're not far from \"civilization.\"NOTE: *Temperature* affects battery life to a surprising extent. I'm aware that cold temperature can affect battery life, but the PowerShot seems particularly sensitive to this. When shooting outside in England in December, keeping that second set of 4 AA's was very important. Four AA's alone would not have been enough. However, indoors or at regular temps in spring, summer, and autumn, 4 batteries--especially those manufactured for use in digital electronic goods--will be adequate.*VIDEO/AUDIO: I only took 3 video clips on my trip. My sense is that this is what drains battery life; it certainly drains memory. Nonetheless, I considered the video feature \"icing on the cake,\" and didn't care about it much anyway. So, I was very pleasantly surprised when I played back my video clips on my computer and encountered not only a very clear image which demonstrated the camera's ability in video mode to zoom and refocus fast, but also audio that seemed neither muffled nor--the other extreme possibility--\"tinny.\"(One word of commonsense advice though on using the video mode. Don't speak loudly or at all when you're the shooter, because the microphone will pick up your voice very well due to your proximity to the microphone, and in play-back you'll be roaring compared to all the other sound. I can even hear myself breathing in the playback!)*INTERFACE: The interface of this camera was designed fairly well considering the wide range of options and features. It's got lots of buttons and lots of options, so ***practice*** with this camera before you use it for some special event or vacation, etc. Canon seems to have correctly anticipated which features people will want to over-ride or mess with the most (such as turning the flash to ON, OFF, or AUTO) and separated those buttons from the rest, which is helpful.*COLOR: I have not encountered color distortion when viewing images digitally. I have printed out very few images, since I put images online mostly, so I cannot yet review how the PowerShot's images translate color-wise when printed. Of course, the printer one uses affects the quality and color-correctness of prints, too.*WT/SIZE/FEEL: This camera is totally SLR-esques in feel and heft, though it's more compact than an SLR. I'm happy with the camera's feel. Its size would be difficult to make much smaller given current limits to technology, unless one sacrificed the basic SLR-like mold of the camera. I was able to get this camera completely into the pocket of my winter jacket--I never while in England needed a bag, case, or carrier for it. It will not, however, fit into a typical coat pocket--like on a light jacket, a suit coat, etc. It will fit into a normal purse, I'm sure, but not a small handbag.It *is* heavy, however. That is one thing to note that is a negative. But, along with that heft, I feel, comes better control and stability.There are a few little niggling things about the camera's menus that annoy me, 10x zoom is good, but often not enough for me, and the lens cap doesn't stay on very well (but, it's attached to a camera by a shot nylon cord, so you *won't* lose the cap!), and when I think about these negatives I'm tempted to give the camera 4 stars, not 5; but, there are so many other strong positives with the PowerShot S1 relative to the FUNDAMENTALS of camera use and design--plus a competitive (though not \"low\") price--that I realize the negatives are ultimately minor. If \"4 1/2\" was an option, I suppose I'd give the product that rating.That said, I'll rate this camera \"5 stars\" as an excellent product for the dedicated amateur photographer.", "Date": "June 8, 2005"}, {"Title": "Powerful camera for the price", "Author": "Rose M. Swinson", "ReviewID": "RAZHI6KOE1CKM", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Let me tell you, straight out, this family is a digital family.  We've had digital cameras for years now and we've had quite an assortment.  Everyone, in our family, has one.My personal favorite, is the digital rebel.  I know you're asking, why is she reviewing this camera then?  Easy!  I wanted a camera that I could easily whip out and capture a shot with... but I didn't want the tiny handheld ones.  I wanted something that felt comfortable, in my hand.... yet.. wasn't heavy.  I was also looking for zoom.This camera fits that bill, perfectly! and at a great price too!To start, this camera runs on 4 AA batteries.  Usually, that's a turn off for me, but I picked up some 2300 mhz batteries and I can easily get 500+ shots out of a charge of those, w/ the LCD and the flash on.  With the batteries, this baby weights, about a pound.  While that may seem heavy, compared to the little tiny cameras and cell phones that are avialable these days.. Let me tell you.  That's not heavy.  It's got a great neck strap and the camera carrys comfortably on that, around your neck,  w/out weighing you down.The 10x zoom is real nice!  Now, I'm only using optical zoom, otherwise, with the digital kicked in, it would be a 30x.  I just rely on the optical.  This camera takes some VERY nice pictures with that zoom.  A picture worthy of the Canon name!  And you can capture such a nice picture because of the IS (image stabilization) that is built into this camera.  You will notice little (or no) camera shake when you have it fully zoomed in on something.  Admittedly, it seemed like it, with the first couple test shots I took.  I was looking through the viewfinder, aiming at something down the street.. and it seemed like I was waivering all over the place.  But when I downloaded the pictures.  I was VERY pleased.  Crystal clear!I have the found, that some cameras have terrible color saturation, w/ the picture right out of the camera.  This isn't one of them.  With the default settings, the blues (sky, water) are rich, tonal, and dimentional.  There's no red problems, when shooting reds, that I've noticed.  Sometimes reds will bleed out .. or not appear true.. and that's simply not the case.Indoor pictures.. I'll be honest.. W/ the built in flash, this little camera, kicks my $1K camera's behind!  The flash doesn't tend to wash out the subject (on the default settings).. skin tones are exactly what they are.  Little or no adjustments are needed, in my book.This camera is fast to start up, and write, to the CF card that it uses (buy a bigger CF card!).  It's got auto controls for those that don't want to think.  For those that want to learn a bit more about photography, it's got the F stops, and all that jazz..ALONG WITH...the ability to change your focal point.  You're not stuck in the middle of the frame.  If you want your subject off to the left of the frame..and the rest to be 'soft'... That's not a problem.  With a simple push of the button, your point of focus changes.I can go on.. but I'm sure you have the idea, after reading all these reviews.This is a great camera for the money.  While you maybe taking a step down, in megapixels, you're gaining the zoom ability.

Canon hit the nail on the head with this one. As a botanist/ecologist/photographer (internationally published with medium and large format images), I do a lot of plant photography. I tried the Powershot Pro1 (see my review there) and was left a bit disappointed when compared to the S1 IS I purchased earlier. Although the S1 IS has only 3.2 megapixels compared to the Powershot Pro1's 8 megapixels, the S1 IS can produce images that, for basic uses and prints up to about 8x10 inches, will beat the Pro1. The problem is that the Pro1 seems to have trouble focusing up close (except for its SuperMacro mode which is limited to only 4 megapixels) while the S1 IS rarely misses the exact point. The S1 IS is also much easier to use.The color of the S1 IS is very true and has nice depth. The images are generally less noisy than the Pro1. The colors produced in the vivid function will knock your socks off, and yet it is never gaudy.The real marvel of this camera is Canon's tried and true optical stablization. I have the teleconverter for this camera which gives you the equivalent of a 608mm telephoto (that's about like a 12 power binocular) and not only does the converter actually improve the contrast of the main lens, you can hand hold the thing and get sharp images at only 1/200 of a second. I wouldn't even think of trying that with my EOS 10D, even with image stablization. I have taken some wonderful bird photos with the S1 IS (better than the 10D); they're not publishable, but definitely produce excellent prints.Like most low pixel count cameras, the digital zoom is pretty worthless. I recommend keeping it off and cropping an image taken at maximum zoom.I also highly recommend getting the filter adapter/lens shade kit. It's plastic, so you have to be careful of the threads, but if you put a number 3 closeup lens on the filter adapter and zoom all the way to maximum zoom (not digital zoom) you can get close to life size images. It won't match the EOS 10D with the Tamron 90 mm macro in sharpness, but it comes close for smaller prints, up to about 8x10. But then the S1 IS with a filter adapter and closeup lens doesn't costs over two grand either.I highly recommend this camera, just keep in mind that it does have its limitations. But it's limitations are far, far less than you would expect. It will truly surprise you with what this camera can produce.", "Date": "July 11, 2004"}, {"Title": "Canon S1 IS Experience", "Author": "Al \"Cub Fan\"", "ReviewID": "R2Z6JT19KPHYO", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I have had this camera for about 3 months.  One complaint I read in other reviews is that it uses up batteries quickly.  Well, my experience has been that I think it does very well on Rayovac rechargeable NiMH batteries.  These recharge in 15 minutes and last a long time.The features on this camera are great for beginners and the more advanced.  For beginners you can use all the automatic settings and it does a great job.  For the advanced you have shutter or aperture priority settings as well as manual settings so you can do some creative things.  You can change the ISO from 50 to 400 based on lighting.  I also like the movie mode.  I bought a half gig compact flash card, which are not that expensive, and can store 4+ minutes at the highest resolution to about 20 minutes at the lowest.  The pictures are clear and crisp and the colors are brilliant.  I read some complaints about the flash.  I have not experienced any problems, but it is possible to adjust flash output if pictures seen to be over-exposed, as some complained.At maximun zoom, unless you're using a high shutter speed, the image stabilization is not enough to compensate for movement.  You may need a tripod.  I took some action pictures at a baseball game and used the 400 ISO setting and shot a lot of pictures at 1/2000 sec with max zoom.  The pictures were outstanding!I highly recommend this camera", "Date": "November 1, 2004"}, {"Title": "Great camera!", "Author": "sewing susie", "ReviewID": "R9JOYBUI02Z2T", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I think the Canon Powershot S1 IS is a great camera for those wanting to step up out of a regular point and shoot type of camera.  Wanting something more, I researched various types of digital cameras for a year, and finally placed my order for the S1 IS this past May.Currently, I've taken about 1800 pictures in all types of situations.  The feature that sold me on the camera was the image stabilization and optical zoom.  Yes, the 3.2 megapixels was a concern since I was hoping for 4 or more, but the pics my camera takes have been excellent.  No second guessing in my camera choice!Most shots of mine are outdoors of the kids, sporting events, and recreational activities which produce fabulous pictures.  The indoor shots for school concerts, birthday parties, etc., are very good.  Sometimes some tinkering is needed to get a good shot indoors or in low-light situations.  Auto mode indoors usually produces good shots, however the early evening outdoor shots appear darker than they really are.  I am seriously considering getting a tripod so I can manually change aperature and shutter speed settings to get realistic lighting in evening shots without blurred images from hand shake.  The camera can produce decent low-light shots, but be prepared to spend time experimenting in getting a shot you like.  Manual focus comes in very handy for these shots.I've read much about the lens cap from other reviews.  Actually I like the fact that it slides off easily.  The manual says to loop it through the neck strap so it doesn't get lost, and for people who may turn on the camera and forget to take off the cap, the easy slide off may actually prevent damage to lens when it extends after turning it on.  I really haven't found this to be a problem, more of an asset.Fast moving sporting events can be a little tricky.  Many times I have full zoom on when shooting at soccer games.  With the kids running around a lot, I tended to move the camera as they were moving, but of course, the image freezes in the viewfinder or LCD for two seconds.  The camera can be set to eliminate the freezed image after taking the shot, but there is still a lag time until you can take the next shot, thus your subject is out of the viewfinder.  With this in mind, I decided to set the camera for continuous shooting, keep the camera still and aim for a spot where the kids are headed (but not in the viewfinder or LCD yet), and start shooting.  I get a lot of good shots this way.  Yes, the first several pics are nothing but green grass, but as the kids run across the field continuous shooting works to your advantage.  At events like this, I take about 100 pictures and therefore can pick and choose several that are great shots.  Keeping the camera still while continuous shooting also eliminates blurring.  Although image stabilization does work extremely well, trying to constantly follow players in a game at full zoom causes a lot of extra hand shake and camera movement which can result in slight blurriness.  The continuous shooting mode and keeping the camera still while shooting helps to counteract this allowing the image stabilization to really do its job.Comments have also been made on the tiny LCD compared to other models that have 2-inch plus screens.  Remember, larger LCD's use more battery juice.  I tend to use the viewfinder most of the time anyway so this hasn't been an issue for me.As for the video mode, this camera takes EXCELLENT video clips.  I bought a 512 card when I bought the camera and love taking short clips here and there.  I usually set the video mode to 15 fps, although 30 is recommended for excellent quality.  15 is more than adequate for me just as long as I keep the camera still when recording.  Camera movement makes the 15 fps very evident resulting in a choppy look to the video.  Keeping it still makes for a smooth movie with a decent amount of recording time.  Also, the zoom is a GREAT feature in video mode.  The video aspect of this camera, in my opinion, is a such a plus to parents of school-age children.  No extra camcorder needed for school events and there's no problem sitting in the back seats of the auditorium or school cafeteria.  The 10X zoom will get you close to your child.  (The digital zoom, however, does not work in video mode).As for batteries, get two sets of rechargeables, and keep a spare set of alkaline ones in your camera bag.  Be prepared because when the low-battery indicator goes on, the camera will turn off VERY quickly after that warning.  I purchased a $6 camera bag at Target which fits the S1 IS nicely as well.  No need to buy the name-brand Canon one which is probably pricier.  I also bough a card reader to plug into my USB port so I don't have to worry about plugging the cables into my camera and computer.  This saves on battery life as well.  As for the tiny, useless 32 MB card that comes with the Canon, I have found that I can save about 20 - 30 pictures on it to take in for \"developing\" at a local Rite Aid or CVS.  This is great for mail order pics as well since I really don't care if this useless-sized card gets lost.Overall, I give this camera 5 stars.  It has produced some fabulous pictures for me.  I really wanted a camera with 10X optical zoom because I don't have the time to be cropping a lot of pictures.  I want to get the picture the way I like it when pressing the shutter button.  It does have some shortcomings which would probably bother experienced professionals, but for me its a great camera that does the job I exected it to.  Even recommended it to my brother who bought it as well.  The manual is great too, and is very easy to read and understand.  All the controls are easy access with the camera having the right size and feel.  Auto mode works great in most situations and the camera is great for those like to rely on the camera doing the work most of the time.  The creativity is there, however, for people like me who want to do something more with their picture taking.  Other features I love are the sepia and black and white options.  There are many features one can experiment with when using this camera to stretch their experience in photography.", "Date": "October 4, 2004"}, {"Title": "Canon S1 - best features for this price range", "Author": "K.

The diopter on the viewfinder is another unique feature that this bi-focaled person appreciates. Adjust it to your vision and images are focused perfectly in the viewfinder. The LCD screen can be flipped in different positions, which is handy.  Bonus: fold it down to keep it from getting scratched and full of fingerprints. It's a tad smaller than I'm accustomed to, but suffices.  The pop-up flash is handy, and again, is less likely to get damaged when down. The lens cap, when tethered to the neckstrap, pops right off when you turn the camera on. No more losing lens caps or getting the lens dirty and scratched. (Yes, I'm tough on my cameras.)The 3.2 MP size is perfectly suited to 8x10 or smaller photos. You don't need more than that for casual or semi-professional use. The 32 MB memory card is adequate, but purchase a 512 MB compactflash card and you are set.  Yes, it eats batteries, but purchase a set of rechargeable batteries and charger and you are set to go. I even bought an inverter for my car so that I can plug in the charger when on trips.

THE CAMERA DIED WHILE PROPERLY STORED IN ITS CASE WITH THE BATTERIES REMOVED.  IT NEVER WAS DROPPED.  IT JUST PLAIN DIED.  HAVING RECEIVED NO ABUSE WHATSOEVER, THE CAMERA'S DEMISE MEANS EITHER PLANNED OBSOLESCENCE OR CRUMMY CONSTRUCTION.  EITHER WAY, I'LL NOT BUY ANOTHER CANON SINCE I'M NOT THE ONLY ONE TO HAVE EXPERIENCED THIS.  I'VE DROPPED IT FROM 4 STARS FOR ITS SLUGGISHNESS TO 1 STAR FOR ITS POOR VALUE GIVEN ITS EXPECTED LIFE SPAN.While I am delighted by the camera's picture quality, wealth of features, and logic, there are some caveats. But, although this is just a 3.3MP camera, I think the color quality and resolution will satsify all but the perfectionists. The caveats are all really related to the pace of the focusing, especially when the zoom is used. Going from no zoom to a 10X zoom is to wait for a good two to three seconds for the focus to catch up. At first, the zoomed-in on object will be just a blur -- both to the viewfinder and to the picture itself if you opt to shoot before the focus catches up. And, in addition, there is -- zoom or no zoom -- about a second's delay between getting the frame in focus and getting the shot. So, I've taken off a star for the camera's speed. My objection is not about one to three seconds but about the loss of several candid shots you might otherwise enjoy. The other disadvantage is that the camera DOES go through regular batteries rather quickly. However, with rechargeable batteries, the battery life is several times greater tha with disposable batteries and quite good. (I took about 140 shots on vacation and spent a lot of time fiddling around with the camera in between shots without needing to swap out my rechargeable batteries.) If your primary reason for wanting the camera is to shoot animals, sporting events, or small children, it's quite possible that you'll be less satisfied with this camera than I am. On the other hand, there is more to love than the quality and color of the pictures you do catch. The features, which are many, are easy to use once you've read the manual to find which buttons do what. (This is NOT, as a few have written, a difficult camera to learn to use. You can and will be up and running with it in a short time. However, thanks to the wealth of features, the advanced features will take some additional time to learn. This seems reasonable enough to me. Excel is more difficult to use than a calculator and quite difficult to master in all its aspects. That's not because Excel (or this camera) is awkwardly designed. On the contrary, both are very well-designed. Excel is more difficult to MASTER (not use but master) than a calculator because it does so much more. So, of course, MASTERING all the features of this camera will take more time than MASTERING all the features of a disposable camera. Seems fair and logical enough to me.) Some of the features I especially like: - It is a cinch to disable the flash by simply cycling through the flash options afforded by the dial (i.e., \"diopter adjustment dial\") that is located, logically enough, right next to the flash. If you decide to shoot a picture off your TV or to shoot a lit Tiffany lamp at night or to capture just the candles on a birthday cake (and so on and so on), you'll love the ability to turn off the flash. - The default settings for the camera seem very logical -- the highest setting for photo quality, the disabling of the digital zoom, the enabling of the red-eye protection, etc. So, if you can't wait to start shooting, you'll start off with high quality shots and with setting that you'd probably want most of the time. (Your digital zooming can and probably should be done via software after you've captured the highest quality image with the optical zoom. This will give you the option to decide later whether you really want to give up the quality of the image for a closer look. If you use the digital zoom when you shoot, you've given up the option to back off for higher quality. If you decide that you'd rather give up the quality for a closer shot than the 10X optical provided, you'll get the same result via the included editing software.) - Macro photography requires no special setting. However, to avoid overexposed macro shots indoors, you may elect to use the zoom rather than to get right on top of your subject. - The included software provides the option to see what apertures and shutter speeds were used for each shot and whether or not the digital zoom was used. (It doesn't directly tell you whether the optical zoom was used.) - For those not adverse to reading, the Canon documentation is extensive. Final tip: Discover early the diopter ajustment dial next to the immediate left of the viewfinder. This is a focus for the viewfinder. The focus on the viewfinder was not clear until I discovered this little dial. Once adjusted, it has tended to stay adjusted.<P(...) If the MAIN attraction of this camera is the stabilized 10X optical zoom, you might be surprised to find that it becomes the least desireable feature thanks to its slow focus. However, as one who has owned a Nikon and a Fuji in the past, I soon found that the Canon jumped to the head of the list for its picture and color quality -- as well as for its excellent additional features. And, oh yes, the camera is loads of fun. You can spend hours exploring its features and in discovering the advantages of its various modes. In just two days, the camera has me taking shots I've never been able to take before. I haven't mastered the camera, but I've acquainted myself with a host of new (i.e., to me) features already. More important, most of my pictures are coming out great. I can still come up with some duds, but that's not the camera's fault!

When i depressed the button to take the picture on my old camera, i could follow my subject as it moved, and when it could lock into focus, it would.  What you have to end up doing is focus on a stationary object at the same distance/focal length as the moving object you want to shoot.  Get it to lock in focus and then move over to your moving object and shoot it.  It's really not that bad, but not ideal either.- only 3.2 mp.  I sure wish it was 5.- electronic zoom.  I had manual zoom with my last camera and that was outstanding.  It was so precise and I could zoom at the speed I wanted.- no low light auto-focus assist lamp.  What this means is that if you're shooting in low light, it takes about 1.5 seconds for it to focus.  If you're shooting kids or something moving, that is not easy.Bottom line is that all the important qualities in a camera are here, and the movie mode is awesome.

The body style is ergonomically pleasing and lightweight, the overall design is simple to use, it will satisfy a novice and professional alike, and the pictures are beautiful! Even the manual is well designed. My long search for the perfect camera finally came to an end.When I first took this camera out of the box I was in love with the design. Weight is important to me, and this camera balances beautifully. It's extremely lightweight and easy to grip. Obviously, a lot of engineering went into the body style. After trying out a myriad of cameras that fit my hand clumsily, this one fit like a glove. The only drawback is that it's meant to be gripped with the right hand, so it could take some adjusting for lefties. Otherwise, it's an ergonomic 10 out of 10.The overall design of camera options leads the pack. It won't take long to master the operation of this camera. The most used options have their own buttons, so you don't have to wade through menus all the time. It is loaded with features, and sometimes this makes a camera hard to master for a novice. Not with this one! If you want a point and shoot camera that you can set and forget, this camera is for you. If you are a hobbyist or pro who wants the ability to easily switch from automatic to manual operation, this camera won't disappoint. It is also a camera that can grow with you. With a ton of add-ons and interchangeable lenses, you won't have to shell out money for a new camera as your skills improve. The zoom is more than you get with most cameras, and having a viewfinder is a must if you like to shoot outdoors in bright light. There's even a vision adjustment on the viewfinder. You may have read criticism of the lens cap. If you read the manual, you will see that it's meant to attach to the neck strap, so you really don't have to worry about losing the cap as some reviews state. I would prefer, however, a more secure snap on cover.As we all know, the proof is in the pictures, and Canon is still delivering the goods. I immediately set out to shoot a little bit of everything. In my opinion, one of the hardest shots to get perfect with point and shoot is indoors at night with inconsistent ambient lighting. I used the low light option on the dial, and I was really impressed. The shots I took were very evenly lit and the flash hadn't overexposed my subjects. I took a picture of an outdoor scene through an indoor window using the zoom. The picture looked like it had been shot outdoors rather than from inside. I took a picture during the day in a well lit room with no flash and it was beautiful.If you buy this camera, do yourself a favor and spend an hour going through the manual. You will find out how easy it is to control the many options, so you will be more apt to use them. I even liked the manual design. There are separate manuals in Spanish and English, so you can dispose of the one you don't need.I know I will be happy with this camera for years to come.

Lucio \"juannyc\"", "ReviewID": "RP1WOCUQELY7U", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "My experiences with Canon cameras have been excellent, and so far they achieve the best picture quality and best colors. Solid feel, portability, good ergonomics, simple menus, good software and attractive styling are features that Canon cameras have and I like, and the S1 IS, for the most part, is no exception.So why do I give it 3 stars?Simply put: IT DOES NOT FOCUS EFFECTIVELY IN LOW LIGHT CONDITIONS.  I feel this fact has been glossed over by many other reviewers. Just about all digital Canon cameras I know of have an Automatic Focus Assist Light or Illuminator. (A little beam of light projected by the camera so that it can achieve a rapid and sharp focus in difficult or low light conditions). The Canon Supershot S1 IS does NOT have an AF Illuminator. This omission makes it tough to shoot indoors, at least for me. Some say it takes longer, and yes sometimes it does, but often it just doesn't focus at all, especially when zoomed in on people. Perhaps I have been spoiled with my trusty Canon Powershot S100 camera (with an AF illuminator); it does an excellent job in low light and indoors.AN AF ASSIST LIGHT SHOULD BE AN ALL DIGITAL CAMERAS! I was \"iffy\" about buying this camera for that reason, but the reviews gave me the impression that this was not an issue. However it is an issue that one should be aware of, hence my review.Although you can focus manually (and very well too), and it has an automatic focusing bracketing feature, trying to get a spontaneous shot of someone indoors, at a party or at dusk becomes easier said than done. It will focus better on a still object or shooting with a wide angle in a dim setting.There are so many pluses of this camera; I won?t elaborate since other reviewers have detailed them rather well. My favorite is the variable speed and nearly silent zoom, which can be zoomed slowly during the excellent movie mode. It is also very fast to zoom to the full 10x with virtually no blurred images (handheld, with out a tripod) thanks to the built in Image Stabilization. This blurry image at 10x issue was a problem I had with my previous camera (Olympus C-740).I know that one digital camera can't do it all (at least not yet), but if the Supershot S1 IS could focus well in low light, then I would then say this one does it all. If you want an outdoor camera, or don't plan to take a lot \"happy snappies\" of friends and family indoors, then this camera is for you. For now it looks like I?ll just carry both of my Canons!PS: Unless you are going to be making huge prints (larger than 8 x 10) the 3.2 Megapixel resolution is more than adequate for most users. I would like 4 Megapixel... but that is not a deal breaker for me.UPDATE: 11/15/04Well I did find the camera that so far appears to do it all, the Nikon Coolpix 8800. It is amazing, and I recommend it as an alternative, worth the extra money! Focuses quickly in low light, and does have AF light as well as Vibration Reduction, 10 x Zoom, great movie mode and an excellent lens.UPDATE: 08/20/05Looks like Canon listened, the new Canon PowerShot S2 IS does have an AF assist lamp!", "Date": "June 12, 2004"}, {"Title": "Canon Powershot S1 IS Good Family Camera and Beyond", "Author": null, "ReviewID": "RDCGZG84VD9MN", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Hi everbody,First of all, I was fortunate enough to get this camera from Adorama Cameras for $374.00 plus shipping.  Must have been some sort of introductory special on Amazon.  Got the camera about a week after ordering.  Let me say that this is my 4th digital camera and I regard this as the best I have had so far.  I have owned both Olympus and Minolta digital cameras prior to buying the Canon S1 IS.  I want to say that Canon definitely thought out the ergonomics and the feel of this camera.  It feels very comfortable and sturdy (I'm right handed.  It is clear that they did not skimp on workmanship  I love the smoothness of the 10x Optical zoom (that's reason I wanted a good long zoom camera)and there was no blurriness thanks to the Image Stabiliser.  I recommend if you are taking shots and you are zooming in at 3X or greater on the optical zoom, engage the IS.  I don't recommend using digital zoom on any digital camera, it is always easier using photo editing software to crop your photos.  I tried the camera at a couple of family outings and I was definitely impressed.  I was a bit concerned about it being only 3.2MP but the pictures I took looked better than my sister's 4MP Kodak camera.  The auto mode works fairly well and the LCD certainly shows good detail in bright sunlight but be warned, have the display set at full brightness especially if you are using the EVF outside.  There are only 2 display brightness settings.  The photos I took had good contrast and very vibrant colors.  There was some very slight purple fringing on some shots I took with the optical zoom at maximum.  You may need to adjust the exposure setting if you are trying to photograph a subject that is on a background that doesn't contrast well.  I also found that you definitely need rechargeable AA batteries, especially if you are running the LCD screen and if you are running the camera in movie mode.  That reminds me, the movie mode is incredible but you need at least a 1GB card to record anything substantial at 30 fps.  I recommend if you can afford it, get the 4GB microdrive.  I have heard that you can take the microdrive out of the Muvo2 4GB player and use it in the camera since the S1 accepts CompactFlash Type II cards if you know how to do it right.  With so many different modes, this camera will definitely grow with you.  I wished that Canon had put a flash hot shoe on this camera but I can understand them not trying to create a light stripped down version of the EOS Rebel.  Indoors, the flash is above average compared to other digital long zooms but could still be better, it will illuminate your subject.  The camera AF did slow down somewhat in very dim lighting, make sure to run it in night scene mode, not auto.  The extra long exposure lag definitely improves the shots and just to be fair, the low light performance was certainly superior to other digital cameras I have owned.  I do like the fact that Canon included a nice get started quickly template but the manual could be better organized.  For most people, I would say using it in auto is fine but if you like to tinker, the full manual mode is a lot of fun.  All in all, a good buy despite the fact that Canon should have also included a AF assist lamp which surprised me somewhat since they put them on most every camera they make.

The main features I purchased the Canon for were for the 10X optical zoom and the image stabilization, both of which work tremendously.The battery life is fairly decent, I got around 200 pictures with one set of rechargeable NiMH batteries - albeit with the flash mostly turned off and using the viewfinder. The picture quality is very good, and the 3.2MP coupled with the optical zoom make for some spectacular short and long range photography.This camera is relatively similar size and weight wise to the Minolta S414, another camera that I've had some experience with. The Canon's 10X zoom far outdoes the 4x zoom on the S414, and the picture quality is relatively similar (in some instances the S414 does deliver a better picture.) Movie quality is better on the Canon than on the S414.I also purchased a Lexar 512MB CF card to use with the camera. The interface is great, most pictures are stored on the card before I can move my face away from the viewfinder. Right now I have 169 pictures of highest resolution settings on the card and have room for around 250 more (according to the camera). The 512MB card may be overkill - the average user can probably get away with a 256MB card.As several other reviewers mentioned, the auto focus feature in the zoom doesn't seem to work well in dark environments (i.e. indoors, in dark areas, or in dense fog.) One trick I've found to work around it is to zoom out and then zoom back in on your subject. The other is to be patient and wait until the camera can figure things out, which can take up to 5 seconds in some instances. If you're taking pictures of moving items - forget it. But if you have the patience to wait, the results are really worth it. There are several setting which you can tinker with which probably would take care of this problem. The auto-focus problem is the reason I gave it 4 stars (once you get used to it, it's really a half-star problem - but still a problem.)For someone looking to upgrade from a non-zoom or mid-zoom camera or looking to explore amateur photography, I would recommend this camera hands down.", "Date": "July 26, 2004"}, {"Title": "From a Web Developer", "Author": null, "ReviewID": "R2K89Z049KS6A4", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Being a grad student, I am very picky when it comes to spending a larger amount of money on a piece of hardware technology.

But that gets heavy and hot in the Everglades.I have been using the S1 now a month or two.  I absolutely love it.  The zoom power is wonderful for that long bird shot.  You lose some resolution using the digital zoom though, but that's expected.  It's a light camera but you can still handhold long shots thanks to the image stabilization.  I use a monopod most of the time now.It's almost like an SLR, with the digital viewfinder!  Using the back screen that most cameras have is difficult in bright sunlight.  The digital viewfinder in the S1 is still a minor difficulty in bright sunlight, but very usable.  All the functions are pushbutton, and settings visible in both screen and viewfinder.Functions at this price level are amazing.  I am very very happy with available options.  It has a \"one button preset\" where you can set one button to do a chosen function.  I use that button for setting ISO speed.I use a UV filter all the time with the special adapter.  Beautiful outdoor shots.Macro capability is very good.The S1 is not cheap...but it tries very hard to be a digital SLR.

I have my own website and pics are fine.  3.2megapixels is ok.  I think more sensor resolution must be coupled with better optics, otherwise no point in a 6mp camera with plastic lenses.  So the S1 is fine in this respect.  Good optics, adequate sensor.Battery life is good.  Some complain about battery life.  I find it good with 2200mah Nimh rechargables.  But those who complain don't realize the first few times you use a rechargable battery the battery only has limited capacity....so it ain't the camera, it's the battery.  If you get new batteries, charge them up and stick them in a flash light and discharge them like this a few times.  Then you will get good battery life in camera.I gave the S1 5 stars.  It deserves them.If you don't need all the features or long zoom, try the outstand \"A\" series by Canon.  The A75 is a great value.

Now I needed something lighter and choose to stick with Canon because of their optical quality.  I picked the camera after having gone to a photofair and seen blown up prints taken with different cameras and subsequently chose the PowerShot S1.  Pixels are too much in focus, too little is said about optical quality.  My own experience is that even tough this camera has less pixels than some other cameras, the picture quality is better due to optical quality of lens.I have not had time to learn all the settings of the camera but take it as it comes.  It's a good idea to start using the Auto-mode.  I have bought a Lexar 256 mb. card and it works fine - no problems.One problem I have is with the White Balance of colours.  In daylight when pictures have strong contrasts - the sky always comes out white - even when the other colours are fine.  I don't know how to overcome this problem, but it annoys me.  I had hoped that downloading a firmware update from Canons webpages would solve it, but it didn't.Conclusion is that I'm happy with the camera, the quality seems good and the picture quality is the best I have seen from all those different cameras I saw in that fair, but white balance needs to be improved.A year later:I have learned to manipulate the whitebalance and that has improved the problem with white skies and daylight somewhat.

It has controls for every aspect of picture-taking that I could ever want to adjust. The commonly used functions are usually only a button press or two away rather than buried in the menu system.The movie mode is quite useful rather than just a gimmick. I can definitely see myself leaving my camcorder at home in situations where movie-taking opportunities will be few and far between.My D-460Z supports alignment guides for panoramas (when using Olympus-branded flash cards), but I'm blown away by the PowerShot S1 IS's \"Stitch Assist\" implementation. For every shot after the first, you are presented with a dimmed version of the overlapping one-third of the previous shot with which to align your next shot.I really like that this camera uses standard AA cells. It will save me a fortune on extra battery sets vs. the Li-ion batteries used in several other digicams.I wish Canon had opted for a USB 2.0 or Firewire interface because the files -- movies, especially -- take forever to download over USB 1.1. This fact did not detract from my rating because I find the workaround to be perfectly acceptable: a USB 2.0 or Firewire CompactFlash reader.I do have a couple of nit-picky focus-related complaints. First of all, I find the autofocus to be very problematic in incandescent room light, which leads to many out-of-focus shots because even the manual focus is difficult to use in that light.

The camera has a lot of capability that you have to learn, such as how to control where it focusses and where it sets the exposure, but once mastered, it is fantastic.  I am not a professional, but an experienced enthusiast.  The 3.2MP has not been a drawback for me, since the zoom capability allows putting my pixels where I want them.  The movie capability is awesome, especially the 640x480 30 frames/sec with fine compression, but with corresponding awesome storage requirements!!

Also, when you're zoomed in at 10x, it helps you keep the camera steadyManual Focus:  I guess this counts as a feature, but that being said, its not a very good one.  When you zoom in, it wont let you focus under two feet, which isnt very useful.  Also, the auto focus on this camera isnt so great, since it only has one point and doesnt have an AF assist lamp, so focusing right can be really annoying sometimesMovie Mode:  This camera has a GREAT movie mode.  The 30 frames per second really makes the movies look nice, plus the sound quality is better than most digital cameras.  The thing i really like, though, is that you can use the 10x lens to zoom while you're taking movies, just like a camcorder.  Now, the zoom isnt silent while your taking a movie, even if you use it at its \"reduced speed\" for the movie mode.  If you use the zoom's REALLY slow speed, though, it doesnt interfere with sound, so thats not really a problemPanoramas:  This camera helps you take a series of pictures to form a panorama.  It saves them as individual pictures, but the software the camera comes with to stich them is very easy to use and stiches the pictures nicelyTime lapse:  This camera can take time lapse shots; you can take up to 100 pictures, and its a nice mode if you want to make an interesting movie  Theres probably alot of other modes i didnt get to, but when you get this camera, youll be trying to figure out all it can do for a long time.

I really like this camera, and here is why:1) It has an \"Auto\" mode so that my wife and kids can use it without worrying about flash, f-stops and shutter speeds.  OK, almost all digitals do this.  ;-)2) But, you can change to Program AE, Tv, Av or fully manual mode.  Now we're talkin'!  I'm all for point and shoot ease when it comes to family snapshots, but sometimes I like to get creative with a sunset, moonrise, night shot, fill-flash, silhouette, etc. and this camera can handle it.  It's got up to a 15-second shutter, which is longer than many in this class.3) You can add narration comments to photos, which I find handy when documenting something that the picture alone does not explain.  Like, I do genealogy photos so I want to say who lived there or whose grave marker that was, or whatever.  You can download the comments to the computer as a WAV file as well.  It's like taking notes while you're recording the scene.4) Movie mode is *almost* a replacement for my Sony Digital8 camcorder.  Other than the camcorder recording in stereo and having better low-light sensitivity, the Powershot S1 can handle most of what I use a camcorder for.  Image stabilization and zoom while recording are bonuses in this camera class.5) No lens swapping any more.  With the 10x zoom from 38mm to 380mm, there's no need to carry any lenses with it, although you can get a wider wide angle and a longer telephoto, but why?  If you're that into photography, you should be looking at digital SLRs anyway.6) Vari-angle LCD makes it so much easier to get an angle that you can't when the LCD is attached.  Shoot over your head, from your feet, around a corner...  not many cameras in this class can do that.7) Stitch Assist mode.  OK, this was a feature I liked in particular that you may not care about.  But I like to take panoramas, and with the T70, I was guessing how much overlap I had, what the exposure should be for each shot, etc.  With the Powershot S1, it locks in white balance and exposure on the first frame, then shows you 1/3 of the last frame in the next shot so you can line them up.  I can do hand-held panoramas all day!  :-)OK, so there were a few negatives that I'll share too:1) There's no hot shoe for my Vivitar flash, although you can buy a Canon flash unit for this model.  But I probably won't because I think the built-in ~15 ft. flash range will be all I need.2) Speaking of that... flash pictures that you take from about 5 feet and closer seem to be washed out in the highlights.  That may be because the sensor is reading the dark background and overcompensating.  But you can manually adjust the flash power, which I set to about 1/4 on the scale and that seems to cure the problem for close ups.3) A low-light focusing lamp would help.  I had some trouble on Halloween eve focusing outdoors with natural light.4) I think I like the pre-flash type of red-eye reduction rather than the little LED light that's on this camera.  It doesn't seem to take care of red-eye in all cases (like when people are not looking directly at the camera), but it works OK in most cases.I believe the newer Powershot S2 takes care of some of these issues, but then again, it's almost 2x as expensive at this point in time.When you buy this camera, you will need a case and a memory card for it.  I bought the Tamrac 5693 Digital 3 Bag here on Amazon, which fits the S1, an extra set of batteries, an extra memory card, and the camera's video cable.  I've heard that the Canon PSC-70 bag is on the small side for this camera.  The memory card I bought (here on Amazon again) was the SanDisk SDCFH-512-901 512MB Ultra II CompactFlash Card, which has plenty of space for what I need and is a pretty fast card.One other thing you'll probably want to buy is some NiMH batteries.  I didn't have a charger either, so I bought a package of 8 2500ma Energizer batteries and a nice Powerex MH-C204W charger for about $50 at [...]I came away with this whole setup for about $375, which I think was a great deal and well worth the convenience and quality that I got.  I considered the Panazsonic Lumix DMC-FZ4 too, but I liked the Canon features and the fact that it used cheaper AA batteries and CF card.

Virtually every setting is configured automatically in movie mode, which makes movies something I will avoid with this camera (but I didn't expect to get a video camera anyway, so not a big con here).The USB connection to the PC from the camera uses a special connector on the camera. This connection is very small, and it is difficult to insert the USB wire into it. I'm afraid something might break if this connection is used often. A Compact Flash card reader might be the best solution here, but that puts extra wear on your memory card :\\No AC adapter included ... only a 32MB Compact Flash card included (which will only hold something like 20 images on the highest quality setting).Overall, I am very happy with this camera as my first digital camera.

However, for snapshots, for fast-moving targets (particularly in day-light or with flash), it works quite well.It feels good in the hand, like an old-type SLR. The shutter release is in a comfortable spot, though some menu buttons can too easily be pressed by your palm. Note that it's fairly heavy - I like it the feel, but it isn't the forget-it's-in-your-pocket/purse variety.For me, for all it does it doesn't do what I want it to. I find the camera excels at snapshots - for which I wouldn't have bought a 10x zoom. I am realizing, as well, that 3.2 megapixels renders computer-resizing difficult (again, small objects), as too much detail is lost. I think more megapixels, macro, and less zoom would probably work out better. Since the lens--if you haven't bought its second lens--only goes as wide as 35mm., I see this as either a camera for snapshots or a specialized camera for those taking photos from afar or of/from moving objects. The image stabilizing feature works especially well.Overall: It has a lot of bang, but not the right combination of bang, for the buck.", "Date": "March 31, 2006"}, {"Title": "amazing!", "Author": "S.

It is also annoyingly slow to auto focus, especially on close-ups, and fails to lock in on many shots. The camera's manual focus feature is too cumbersome to be of any use.

An out of warranty LCD problem took it out of commission for 3 months while Canon fixed it after admitting a manufacturing problem. Two months later the lens retraction system gave out - the lens stays out, will not retract, while the gearbox cranks. The only way to get my pix out was to buy a card reader for my pc; the failure disabled the entire camera.This is a notorious problem for Canon, with millions of users complaining, and Canon ignoring it. (It's the E18 error and it's well documented: [...])I've always been a big Canon fan - my old SLRs are all Canon. So are my printers and scanners. But Canon's refusal to deal with this problem is unacceptable. The failure was not do to accident or misuse. I treat my camera like a baby. They wanted $220+ to take a look at it, with no guarantee of repair. The camera isn't worth that, so I stripped it down myself.The problem was not sand, or dust, or anything I did. The problem is a serious gear-system malfunction deep beneath the circuit boards and virtually inaccessible to even a knowledgeable techhead.

The camera has exceeded my expectations and is better than the Olympus is many respects.a) The Canon S1 has a much better video mode that records in 2 modes (hi and low resolution) with great sound. Even in low resolution, the video looks good. I can also frame the video by zooming in and out since the 10 times zoom works great while in video mode.b) The stabilizer is great. I have a technique that I use to capture quick shots using only one hand (eg, when skiing or when driving). I'll set the film speed to the highest (ISO 400). I then set it to shutter priority mode (Tv in this camera), and set the shutter at a fast speed--1/400 second or so). I just hold and aim the camera, holding it with one hand,  in the general direction of the action I want to capture, without looking into the view finder to focus, and snap away. The camera's auto focusing unit is fast enough that I've captured very good shots that I would not have been able to capture any other way.The Olympus may have slightly better color and resolution than this camera but not really noticeable in any way that counts (to me at least).I've taken this camera on multiple vacations (bryce and zion canyons in Utah, skiing at Sugarbush and Killington) and it has performed admirably even when I was taking pics in a snow storm (in Sugarbush).

I was unaware of the PowerShot S series at the time, but have the PowerShot G2 model.Have had the PowerShot S1 IS for over 5 1/2 years now and still works great. Its LCD went black (known malfunction) in June 2008 and sent to Canon to have it repaired. It was well out of warranty, but had replaced free of charge because of the defect. Received it a few weeks later and has worked as it should ever since. For some reason, its picture quality is a smidgen less from before the repair. I have recently purchased Panasonic DMC-ZS3.Overall experience...- Taking photos of the snow comes out clear and not too blue under ambient sunlight. Takes great sunset photos without the flash. Once took many photos of the Moon - even lunar eclipse twice, with decent results on maxed zoom. However, it takes trial and error because focusing is difficult with dark/bright subject.- Picture quality very good, but has compression artifacts and some grain/noise.- Movies are quite yellow and grainy under incandescent lighting, but much cleaner and whiter under fluorescent. Does surprisingly well in grayscale (B&W;) on well-light highways at nighttime, especially in the rain and snow (albedo effect helps?). Recording movies has subtle-bright vertical bars, i.e. chandelier, tail/head lights, and sun (says a phenomenon with CCD in the user manual), but as with any given CCD camera, these bars aren't recorded in the photos.- Excellent movie recording at the time of this model, but mono sound to the newer S2 IS (I don't have that camera).- Don't record movies with alkaline batteries - after two minutes, they are exhausted. With NiMH Duracell batteries, once I recorded about an hour of movies before the low battery light came on display. Have not tried lithium.- Recording movies with high-capacity card works well, but using a standard (not high-speed) card will cause corruption, or more likely, intermittent dropped frames, especially when moving or zooming quickly on the fine setting. Use of 640 X 480 @ 15 fps on any speed card recorded w/o problem.Suitable with the neck strap and small case, but not for carrying in your pocket (why I purchased the Panasonic). I would recommend this camera, and if you do buy it, check for firmware updates and watch out for any LCD defect. If the camera's viewfinder starts flickering intermittent green/purple blotches, it is a matter of short notice the display will go black, needing repair.Camera Window has a tendency to malfunction on PC and Mac (uncertain of its known issues), but when it works, copying the data is straightforward, but will copy 1-2 megabytes per second via USB.Hope this review is helpful.

I was just getting everything set perfectly (yes, it's taken me 4 years) when the lens quit extending.  It is now a paperweight or doorknob art.  It does still read cards...a plus, for door knob art, I think.  I saw one person whose camera didn't work for them in the winter very well at all, mine worked fine while dog sledding and other great times in Montana and this camera moved from Florida all at once.Shooting it fully automatic as you would with a cheap compact, you miss out on many of the features, not to mention: many good photos from dawn through a dimly lit club in the wee hours~~all without flash.  If you can read the manual, you can work this camera, which has ways to personalize settings without worries as you can always \"return to default\" without concern.Mine enjoyed over exposing when running free on fully automatic in full on daylight.  I wish it would had been better at identifying moving targets and selecting shorter exposures, even in rapid mode.These problems aside, the camera itself is capable of very good photos. Be advised,  this could be a point and shoot, but to get the photos that you really want, decisions must be made!  I don't believe this is for the casual photographer that is only interested in point-and-shoot.  A feel for the basic photography concepts: using aperture or timing priority or fully manual; knowing what effects ISO and exposure compensation, etc.  These will all be explained enough in the manual for you to operate the camera enough to enjoy it, I think. If you know how to use Picasa, the simplest way to add UV filter, I think, you don't even need to buy the proprietary click in version to actually place on the camera to make your photos look more appealing and professional.  Go to go to Irish Gypsy's my space page to see photos ALL taken with this camera.I strongly recommend spending a few hours with the advanced manual and the camera and learning properly how the exposure, white balance and focus controls work. It will really pay off!  What you see on the approximately 1 knuckle length wide by about 1.5 knuckle long display screen will be what you get.  Though it is difficult to see the itsy bitsy screen in bright daylight, this camera really shines in dim light  with help from things like white balance to make sure you don't get the false sepia tone that makes things look so awful in dim light photos and Image Stabilizer mode, which I used even on the tripod, in case I forgot to turn it back on.  Either way, this camera ate batteries like a bear on huckleberries.  My battery recharger is worn out!!  I'll be replacing the camera and the recharge.All in all, worth the cost of purchasing the camera as a first digital camera.

We'd been really happy with the 3100, and we'd read a lot of professional reviews of available cameras before settling on this one.  A lot of people liked it, so we figured it was a good bet for us.At first, though, it was frustrating; the camera seemed to struggle with focus indoors, and we weren't able to get it to take many good pictures.  For the first half an hour, I wondered if it would just be better to return it and go for another camera.However, that's first impression; and I was used to a little point and shoot camera.  Once you get used to this one, though, you find that it's much more capable; and the problems it has are mostly things you can get around.Firstly, the focus in low light.  There are a number of ways around it - firstly, the manual focus combines with the autofocus pretty well.  I was able to get some pretty sharp results out of this the very first time I tried it, using the camera at full zoom in not great lighting.  Secondly, you can use some of the little camera tips (focusing on similar-distance objects that the camera can pick out better - a little backward as a solution, but it works pretty well) and finally, because the camera lets you configure a custom shooting mode yourself, you can set up a hyperfocus mode.  A lot of people using this camera have found that a decent hyperfocus setting all but wipes out the camera's struggles with focusing in low-light, allowing it to work well as an indoor point-and-shoot camera.The next issue is the screen size - but honestly, I don't have a problem with it at all, probably because it's the same size as our old camera had.  On top of that, the screen is a decent resolution, it's clear and much brighter than the screen on our old camera, and the fact that you can tilt and flip it means you can take pictures from just about any angle or position you can dream of.  If you want to take a picture with the camera close to the ground, just flip the screen out and angle it upwards; and if you want to take pictures of yourself, flip the screen around.  No more guesswork, and no more pulled muscles and twisted necks trying to take tricky pictures!The other features add together to make this camera wonderful, especially at the price.  The video mode is great - 30 frames a second, 640 by 480 pixels with good sound recording to boot, though you'll want a fast memory card to use it, and the video clips come out as fairly hefty AVI files.  The 10x zoom is nice to have too - you can take pictures you were never able to before.  Image stabilization, too, works a treat - and the battery life is wonderful.Basically, this camera has traded megapixel resolution for features and versatility, and I think it's more than worth it.  3.2mp seems small in today's market, but it's still a good resolution; far more than is needed for web pictures, and plenty to produce crisp 5x7\" prints.  And with the other features that this camera has, the pictures you'll be able to take will simply be better than those you could have taken with a higher mp, but less capable camera.In the end, it's a little less accessible than the simpler point-and-shoot cameras at first, but it's very rewarding once you get to grips with it.  Definitely worth getting, and definitely worth sticking with.(Update - after almost a year of use, we still really like this camera.  Its quality for general photography is great, and the quality of videoclips it can takes are more than good enough to put onto a DVD.  However, we've missed the quick response of our old little camera sometimes - there are certain situations where our old Nikon was faster and much easier to handle, and for very close-up photography, the lack of resolution means you're a little limited.

Unless you're blowing up poster size prints, this is all the camera you will ever need.  The 10x optical gives extremely crisp full zoom pics and even with full digital zoom (32x) the pics still look pretty good.  It is bulkier and heavier than my powershot A60 (which is also a great camera), but the extra pixels and super zoom make the larger package worth the effort to drag it around.  I couldn't believe the quality of the video that I took in existing light at night time.  With my 512mb card, I can use the S1 as a digital camcorder and it is certainly a lot smaller and lighter than a camcorder.

I enjoy the everyday kind of photo taking that most of us do. This was my first digi cam and to tell you the truth it is a little overwhelming at first. But Canon has done a great job with making it fairly simple to figure it all out. When you first get the cam they pretty much have it all on auto, including the software that it comes with. So by the time you get around to reading the manual you have already taken pictures, downloaded them on your cpu, and printed them out. As I am sure I am not alone with the sickness of, play with it first and read it all later. I espeacially like that fact that you really can't mess this camera up to bad with all the functions that it has. (trust me I tried) It is so simple to fix it, all you have to do is turn it off and it resets. But for those of you who like to keep certain common settings there is a setting for you too. If you're reading this review to find out what all the camera can do, well to be honest I really don't know. What I do know is that if you're looking for a camera that takes great photos and movies with the option of getting lens adapters, look no further. This camera will be one that you will be able to learn on while taking pictures all the while. One thing is for sure, the quality of the pictures you get from this camera will test your printer's limits. I am currently chastizing mine as you read this and am gonna have to up grade! But before you go out and buy the S1 you should seriously think about get more memory and rechargable batteries for it. Hope this helps you make a decision, and have fun with taking photos.

While looking to upgrade to a newer camera a few months ago, the S1 IS caught my eye. I waited for it's release and purchased it when it became available.Other than some frequent focusing issues and only being 3.2 megapixels, I liked the camera for what it could do. So I purchased the telephoto lens and adapter mount, and two large high-speed memory cards for the camera.I successfully tested the cards and camera taking many photos around the area in which I live. So, because of it's zoom capabilities, it was the camera I choose to go on vacation with me this past week.What a mistake that was! The first day of the vacation was with me and my wife participating in the Richard Petty Driving Experience at Atlanta Motor Speedway. A very expensive trip and we couldn't wait to capture those moments with still photos and the movie capability of the S1 IS camera.After a few, apparently successful shots, the camera reported a memory card error just as my wife was getting in the race car. So I grabbed another card, with the same result. So I opted to use the original card that came with the camera, and it failed to work as well!!!The camera would sometimes seem to take a photo, but would then report that it was corrupted, there was a card error, or that the card had no images when attempting to play it back.So, now all of those memories are just that. Our only option was to purchase three photos from the experience organizers for over $100, just so that we could have some photographic images of that day.And that was only the first day of our vacation. We spent the next four days traveling about, visiting historic parks and landmarks, amusement parks and a nice evening at Stone Mountain, GA... all with no camera!!!After contacting support, they were less than willing to defer the costs of shipping the camera.
