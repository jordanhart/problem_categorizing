Although we expected the camera and lenses to be quality because we knew exactly what we wanted when picking out a camera, we weren't sure how the other items in the box would rate. Good news: everything was great! We couldn't be happier with this package! If I had to make one tiny complaint, it would be how long it took to get the package delivered to me. The shipping offered was 3-5 business days. It took them 3 full business days to process the order before shipping it out and then it took 7 full business days (not including the day it actually left their warehouse) to get it to me. If they had offered 7-12 business days for delivery I still would have ordered it, but they didn't, they offered 3-5. So, that was a little disappointing but not a deal killer. All in all, a great buy!", "Date": "March 19, 2013"}, {"Title": "Great product!", "Author": "NIKKI G.", "ReviewID": "R1CVWXL005GVVX", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "So happy with this camera, very easy to use, I was a bit intimidated at first but I think anyone could capture amazing photos with such a great product!", "Date": "April 26, 2013"}, {"Title": "Good Deal", "Author": "Ken", "ReviewID": "R3NSZIGB45AX0R", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This bundle is a good deal. The camera works perfectly and the lens are great. I like this bundle because both lens have image stabilization. I haven't used the macro and 2x lens and I considered them fillers. The 32gb card allows 3000 - 4000 pictures. The bag is cheap but I expected that. I bought a larger bag and use the one in the bundle to hold the camera on day trips. That is about all it is useful for to me. I SD card holder is neat but I don't have need for multiple cards. Most laptops have card readers, so the one in the bundle is not needed for me.", "Date": "March 24, 2013"}, {"Title": "Good value", "Author": "Gary Miller", "ReviewID": "R1VWQWY5EAW58W", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "The camera, lens and filters were all great making the deal a better buy than the camera and lens alone at other places.

My review will stick to the accessories.First- If you do have have experience shooting with a SRL I do not recommend buying this camera right before a vacation or big event. You will need time to learn the functions of the camera to take decent shots and a lot more time to take full advantage of the camera. If you are in a time crunch I suggest sticking with a point in shoot.-  I'm pleased with the three lens filters because like all filters they provide the actual lens with a measure of protection from scratches and dust. Without thinking I threw my last camera inside my backpack and scratched the lens. Big mistake.-  I'm very pleased with the image stabilization of each of the lenses. I'm happy I sacrificed focal length for IS.-  The macro/wide angle and telephoto lens accessories are great. These accessories sometimes visibly distort the pictures but for the price I'm extremely pleased. I knew I wanted to occasionally shoot macro but I didn't want to splurge a few hundred dollars on a macro lens. Plus, the camera has a crop sensor so the camera provides a slight magnification to all the photos; the macro lens allows pictures to be taken in cramped places- like taking a picture of a hotel room. (made by Vivitar).-  The SD card reader did not work for me but that could be a problem with my computer. The camera does have HDMI and a/v outputs so the card reader shouldn't be necessary for anyone.-  Unlike some of the other reviewers, I like the carrying bag. It's entirely padded so I put the carrying bag inside my backpack and I don't worry about small bumps or dirt.-  I never saw the tripod because a friend ditched it to save room when traveling from the US to Africa to bring me the camera. However, with enough effort, the mini tripod will work for me when I take long exposer shots. Even without the tripod this set is a great value.-  32 gb SD card capacity is helpful for shooting in RAW so again, very pleased.-  The SD carrying wallet is bulky but does the job. I don't think I will ever use it.-  Extra third party battery, lens cleaning kit, car charger... all work.-  All of the accessories (I don't have the tripod) fit inside the carrying bag.-  The camera comes with a camera strap. It's alright. I never use it but when I allow someone to barrow the camera, I'm happy it's there.-  Each camera comes with a lens cap but I wish I bought extra ones with strings because I know I'm going to misplace them.Not including the two lenses, I would have happily paid $50 for the accessories. The package has everything you need to start shooting. I also separately bought a remote (works well).", "Date": "May 20, 2014"}, {"Title": "This is a great starter camera", "Author": "alicia sheeks", "ReviewID": "R16IQ4WWWCXZ36", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I was super impressed with everything except for the bag that it came with. It is not big enough for all of the equipment that came with this bundle. This was a great buy and the price was right for me. I love shooting with this and it takes amazing pictures. I am glad that I was able to get the warranty with it. The one thing that I did have happen is when it came, there is a small package that included the cleaning stuff for the camera, well I didn't open it till yesterday to use the tabletop tripod in it and the entire bottle of solution had leaked out and everything in it was molded and ruined, so I will be contacting you guys about this issue. I am so happy to have purchased this bundle and the shipping was fast! I needed it asap and I got it! Thanks so much for this great product!
