{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Canon gets it right with this mid-range SD series camera. Small and versatile!", "Author": "AmazonDiva \"Keep Calm and Carry On.\"", "ReviewID": "R2VSS8BIDDSJMF", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Last year, Canon SD870IS camera was a winner in the SD series and the SD880IS manages to offer even more at a lower starting price (than that of SD870IS last year).>>>What's NEW?--New DIGIC 4 technology, up from DIGIC 3 which tries to improve the camera performance in low light and at higher ISO - is it successful? I noted a slight improvement in some shots.- Updated face detection technology. It helps the camera create better contrast for faces and does not bleach out all color from the faces in a shot. The Face Detection Self Timer is new, so if you want to take a group shot including yourself all you have to do is focus the camera on the group and then walk into the group. The camera will detect a new face and click the shot.- A BIGGER CCD - 1/2.3\" up from the previous 1/2.5\" in the SD870 which allows for increase in MPs to 10MP (up from 8MP of SD870)- 4X Zoom (up from 3.8X on SD870) and a wide angle which really helps with shots at close quarters (in a car/bus, of a large group etc.)- Motion Detection is also new. On this mode the camera allows you to focus on a moving object or person by pressing the shutter half-way and then click the shot even though the object/person continued to move across the frame. Earlier, you would have got a motion blur if you tried to take the same picture- The huge 3 inch LCD screen is the same as the SD870 but slightly improved technology gives you brighter playback in low-light which makes it easier to see the shots in replay. It does not have a viewfinder but I have never missed the viewfinder on my SD870 since Canon made the screen anti-glare. I'd take a bigger screen any day over a 2.5 inch screen with a viewfinder, but if you like to use the viewfinder to compose your shots you might need to look at the SD990 IS and drop another 100 bucks.- Updated Scene Modes. It gives you the standard Canon modes like before: Auto, Manual, Digital, Color Accent (you can pick a color to retain in the shot and the rest of the picture will be black and white), Color Swap (swap a color in the pic for another) and Stitch Assist (take a panoramic pic by stitching together many shots).The SD880 IS makes some additions to the special scene modes like Sunset and ISO 3200. The rest remain the same: Portrait, Foliage, Snow, Beach, Fireworks, Aquarium, Underwater, Indoor, Kids & Pets, Night Snapshot. I really like the special scene modes and use them extensively. According to Canon they are based on their library of shots and I agree that they really work very well to give me great pictures.>>>The other Canon features are the same as before on this camera. Some that I find useful are as follows:-Image stabilization, this is particularly helpful at higher zoom- Single Shot and Continuous mode- Colors you can set in the manual mode -  Vivid, Vivid Blue, Vivid Green, Vivid Red, Neutral, Sepia, Black & White, Positive Film, Lighter Skin Tone, Darker Skin Tone, Custom color (RGB adjustment)- Movie mode - regular and also slow synchro (allows you to create interesting videos by shooting at timed intervals)- On camera editing and Pictbridge (print directly from camera)- Red eye reduction - the face detection technology minimizes red eye more accurately than before. If you still get red eye, especially when you're shooting indoors, I've found that this camera can take care of it automatically. You can select \"red eye correction\" option in the menu while in replay mode, the camera automatically searches for faces in the pic and removes the red eye and also allows you to do it manually if you want.- Connect to TV with included cord and run slideshow with transition effects of your choice to view pics. Very useful while on vacation or at a friend's place.- Allows you to erase pics by number of pics, or by date taken, or even by people vs. scenery/objects, a very useful feature in this age of high capacity cards- You can record sound bites on pics to remember locations etc.If you can take the time to read the manual, you will discover more features which allow for more creativity with this camera.>>> Limitations:- No viewfinder, I prefer the bigger screen but it may be critical for you- Some chromatic aberration, common to most point and shoot cameras not just this Canon model- If you're shooting at night in low light with full zoom the wide angle causes the camera to sometimes focus on the dust particles in between resulting in white orbs in the picture. I've taken care of most issues by setting the focus correctly by half pressing the shutter and using night mode but some orbs still show up in some pics especially if there is moisture in the air and I am using the zoom.UPDATE 11/21/2008: Downgrading rating to 4 stars, this camera does have more \"noise\" than my earlier Canons.>>>SummaryThis camera is very well priced for the features it offers. If you are looking for a reasonably priced compact P&S; that is still pocketable but gives you superior shots and more flexibility in composing shots (read wide angle), look no further. If you're looking for a smaller camera than SD880 that gives you superior performance, I recommend the SD790 although it does not have wide angle.", "Date": "October 20, 2008"}, {"Title": "Perfection in a portable, feature-packed point and shoot camera", "Author": "MW", "ReviewID": "R1Y2G5WOO19MUD", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This camera hits all of the sweet spots for those wanting a powerful, small \"point and shoot\" camera with excellent speed and picture quality.  What sets it apart from other cameras in this category is the wide angle lens.  You can fit more into the picture especially group shots and landscapes.  Also, because of the wide lens, you can zoom in on your shots without cutting off objects or people on the edges.  Most other ultra compact cameras do not have this feature.  I have used Canon's other wide angle compact - the SD870IS and loved it.  This newer model adds many upgrades to that model: 10 megapixels, fast and powerful Digic 4 processor, motion detection, 4x optical zoom, intelligent contrast, self timer with face detection, and a smaller size for pocketability.  Even though it is an excellent \"point & shoot\" it is also feature packed and can be adjusted manually with many different options and settings if you want.Things to look for in any camera in the compact/ultra compact category:- Picture quality, of course- Image stabilization so shaky hands don't ruin the shot- Fast shutter lag times and shot to shot times- Face detection software- Good OPTICAL zoom (not just digital zoom)- Great battery life- Large LCD screen- Adequate megapixels to enlarge and crop your images when needed.  Also to print larger sized photos.This camera has all of the above.PROS:Wide angle lensExcellent picture quality10 megapixelsImage StabilizationFace detection and a self timer with face detectionUltra compactFast Digic 4 processor - Almost instant start-up & fast shot to shot4x optical zoom and 4x digital zoomLarge 3\" LCD screenMotion DetectionIntelligent ContrastMultiple pre-programmed picture modes tailored for the best shotEasy to use controls and interfaceAttractiveCONS:No viewfinder (LCD only).  Some prefer viewfinder - personal preference.May be too small for some people - again, personal preference.It's not cheap...  But it is a good value.  You might spend more, but you get a lot more.I have taken many great shots with this camera since I've had it and really couldn't wish for more.  This camera has got to be on anyone's short list when shopping for cameras in this category...  Can you tell that I really, really like it?", "Date": "October 10, 2008"}, {"Title": "Almost perfect Canon", "Author": "Christopher Chung", "ReviewID": "R1D3JS6PBRQTZM", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "This camera rocks, but it does fall short for the title \"Perfect Camera\".  It has all the bells and whistles you expect from a compact digital camera.  This new one even has this great timer function with face detection.  What's so great about it is that it will start the countdown after it detects a new face in the camera.  The wide angle lens is great for group shots, portraits, and the usual stuff with scenery and people.  Yet, it only has a 4X optical zoom.  This is not enough if you have a wide angle lens.  In comparison, a camera with a 36mm equivalent will have a longer zoom even with a 3.7X optical zoom, such as the new SD990IS. Canon Powershot SD990IS 14.7MP Digital Camera with 3.7x Optical Image Stabilized Zoom (Black)  Yet, it is good enough for everyday and for that special trip to Rome.  But, forget about zooming in on that statue a few blocks away as it will not reach.Although this camera has tons of features, it does not have enough manual functions for the enthusiasts.  The new SD990IS has new manual functions to play with aperture, shutter speed, manual focus, and all the good stuff.  I am guessing Canon will not add these manual settings in to the 800 line until later next year.  This is too bad as the functions would make pictures come out even better with the ability to adjust settings to perfection.All in all, this camera is great and would be a good replacement for any older 800 series such as the SD850 or SD870.  I highly recommend it as long as you don't need any manual settings.  The auto focus, DIGIC 4 processor, and the iSAPS will give you enough automatic settings adjustment to take quality pictures in a blink of an eye.PROS:10MP3\" LCDDIGIC 428mm equivalent wide angle lensmore functions than SD870CONS:Only 4X optical zoom (typical for compacts)Skimpy manual settings (typical for compacts)Ugly 3 position slide switch on top of camera (why?)", "Date": "October 11, 2008"}, {"Title": "Tiny Camera with Outstanding Optics ... If You Get a Good One", "Author": "Michael Morgan", "ReviewID": "RY6YHONPOCT1C", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I bought this for my wife as a B'day present to replace her tiny and always carried SD450 (5MB, no IS and 3 years old). The SD880 is a much better camera, costs less than the SD450 did in 2005 and is still tiny (fits in the same case). The improvements are many: ultra-sharp 28mm wide-angle lens with 4X zoom, 3\" bright and clear LCD, both optical image stabilization (IS) and a new low-noise (for it's size) 10MP sensor.A few reviews here report crappy images and/or high noise levels but those are not my findings, at least not relative to other point and shoot cameras. I tested the SD880 against: her Canon SD450 (5MP), my Fuji F31fd (6MP) and a borrowed Panasonic LX-3 (10MP).SD880 images are sharper than any of the three other cameras at the same f-stops and focal lengths.  This is especially true regarding the SD450.  Given the Leica pedigree on the LX-3's super fast (f2.0-2.8) 24-60mm lens I had expected it to be sharper than the tiny SD880 so was surprised to find noticeably sharper images with the SD880 even near the edges of the frame.  Although the Fuji is just 6MP, it is closest in sharpness to the SD880, but only in good light at lower ISO.The SD880 produces lower image noise at high ISO's (400 and up) than both the SD450 and the LX-3.  Beating the LX-3 in this test at ISO 400, 800 and 1600 was also surprising given the LX-3's slightly larger sensor size. The Fuji has the lowest noise level at high ISO BUT images become overly smoothed with less sharpness than either the SD880 or the LX-3.  The SD880 retains more sharpness than the Fuji as ISO is cranked up to 800 and 1600, but did have more noise. ISO 400 noise is low with the SD880 and images are usable at ISO 800. ISO 1600 should be reserved for low-light emergencies where flash is verboten and if prints are kept 6\" x 4\" or smaller.Another low-light advantage of the SD880 (at least for nearly stationary scenes) is the optical IS. This really works and allows lower ISO values to be used with longer shutter speeds. My wife often blurred shots on the SD450 due to camera motion. The IS has helped a lot to reduce this.UPDATE: The optics on my wife's SD880 are so sharp that I decided to get one too.  My copy produces softer photos, not really fuzzy and about as sharp as the 6MP Fuji but without the super crispness of the first SD880. I can clearly see the difference.  My revised conclusion is that it is possible, but not certain, to get a Canon 880IS with exceptionally sharp optics.  For that reason I would downgrade my rating to 4 stars if Amazon would permit (they don't).  Good luck.", "Date": "November 17, 2008"}, {"Title": "Would get 5 stars if only the noise problem is not so obvious", "Author": "QualityFirst", "ReviewID": "R1SO5S86MBWNK0", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "My dissatisfaction with the Canon SD880IS all stem from really missing my old Fujifilm F30.  That good old camera has the best lens/CCD of any point-n-shoot that I've ever seen.  Even ISO1600 photos were usable.  Everything was low noise.  But (probably because it's Made in Ch---) the two F30's that I've owned all crashed way before reaching 2 full years of use.  Yes, I had liked the camera so much that after the first one died I bought another one to replace it.Yes, the problem with the SD880 is NOISE NOISE NOISE.  Even at very low ISO I can see the noise everywhere on the picture.  I tried going for lower pixel count but they are still very visible.  If you want to buy this camera, make sure that you've taken a few photos and zoom them out in playback mode.  It's only after feeding a photo through Noise Ninja that I finally breathed a sigh of relief.Noise problem aside, the SD880 is packed with so many neat features.  I've set the manual white balance to be trigged by the printer button. All I have to do is to point the camera at the white ceiling, press the printer button, and the camera is white-balanced exactly for that specific lighting.Face detection works great, and I really like the TV - self-timer - Face detection combo:  I hook the camera to the TV, put the self-timer on Face detection mode, press the shutter, and nonchalantly walk to the spot of my choice before turning to face the camera.  The camera reads my face and multiple shots of me are made.This camera takes BEAUTIFUL indoor photos -- with a flash, that is.  (The Fuji F30 had been able to take all sorts of great indoor photos without flash.)  The Canon engineers have done a great job with post-processing to get such nice even lighting on indoor photos, especially with such a tiny flash.I take photos with i-Contrast off.  In the playback mode, I can apply the i-Contrast as I choose.  And speaking of i-Contrast, I find that the SD880 tries too hard to second guess what photos I want, and the photos tend to turn out a bit flat.  The photos all improve tremendously when I use Picasa or Photoshop to deepen the shadows.  This is especially true with indoor photos.The video mode is not so useful.  There is no optical zoom with video.  The camera fakes a video zoom by doing a digital zoom.  Of course, if the video is already only 640x480, doing a digital zoom will get you horrendous resolution.  So just pretend that there is no video zoom.  The microphone on the camera is bad.The handling of the camera is very good, and it is a beautiful looking gem.  And I hope that its being \"Made in Japan\" will at least buy me more years than my two terrific but unfaithful Fuji F30's.  Now if Canon were to come up with a 28mm F2.8 camera that had the same CCD-sensor philosophy and the manual controls as the F30 (fewer Megapixels for superb noise control), I would really PAY for that camera, bad economy or no.[Correction to my original review]I gave up on this camera.  I had written that indoor photography with flash was very nice.  I WAS WRONG.  The flash is simply too weak.  If the subject is perfectly still, yes, indoor shots with flash is lovely.  But last week I photographed some kids at a Thanksgiving dinner party.  They weren't even moving that much, but the flash could not freeze their motion.  In a normally lit room, with the camera set at hi-ISO (ISO 250) the shutter speed was 1/10 sec with flash.  Subject blur occurred.  I have never encountered such problem with any of the myriads of point-n-shoot that I've owned in the last 25 years.The camera is truly beautiful to behold.  But at the end of the day, it's decent photos that I want.  The lens is too small, pixel density on the CCD is too high, and the flash too weak.  No fancy bells and whistles on the electronics can overcome these physical limitations.", "Date": "November 12, 2008"}, {"Title": "So many features, a lot to love about this little camera!", "Author": "Modern Blue Argonaut \"No I do not have a shoe...", "ReviewID": "RBEUIUDQ0AW4O", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I was previously a big fan of the Casio digital cameras, but after having to replace two due to the battery compartment loosening over time, I decided to try a different brand, and I'm glad I stumbled across the camera.There are a lot of improvements with this camera over ones I've previously used, but the primary reason for purchasing this camera was the wide angle lens. Most of our family photos are vacations pictures from theme parks and beaches, so this worked out perfectly. I always hated having the important landmarks cut out of the pictures in the past.The other reason I chose this camera was due to the large LCD screen. My son has a Vivitar with a 3\" inch screen, and I really fell in love with being able to instantly see much more detail of the snapshot without having to zoom in to check details.The contrast on the pictures seems spot on, but most of our pictures are taken during the day, so I can't comment on the contrast capabilities in the evening or night.Other than that, the camera has all the bells and whistles that were on my Casio. It has various scene settings such as low light, underwater, aquarium, fireworks, indoors, sunset, foliage, snowscape, beach, pets, kids, nightscape, and portrait. This is nice because I have no idea how to set up a point and shoot to take good fireworks or sunset pictures.This camera also works excellent as a small video camera picking up voice as well as video. I also like the fact that this camera comes with a rechargeable battery and a small SD card. You'll probably want to upgrade the SD card right away though since it doesn't hold many pictures.If you plan to use the camera underwater, I was also thrilled to know that they sell an underwater case. That will come in very useful when we go to Key West and the good news is that Amazon sells it: Canon WP-DC26 Waterproof Case for Canon PowerShot SD880IS Digital Cameras.To sum it up, I love this camera because of the wide angle lens, the large glare resistant LCD screen, the rechargeable battery pack, and the ability to do underwater shots with the addition of the underwater case. I just hope the underwater case drops in a price a bit, since it seems to be overpriced at the present.The shots turn out great, even motion shots, and I will be recommending this camera to everyone I know.", "Date": "October 26, 2008"}, {"Title": "Con: Flash bunnies", "Author": "Nic", "ReviewID": "R21X8YH9EXZM8U", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I just received this camera four days ago. I've taken indoor night photos and outdoor day photos.Four ProsThe camera is quick, and I can whip it out and take a photo without missing a shotThis camera takes really amazing photos at 6 mp (more of that below). And the outdoor photos are amazingly crisp.Night shots are for the most part correctly exposed (not too dark)The scene modes are really fun like photo stitch, color accent, and indoor mode.An idea I hadOn Mega PixelsLike many people have been saying 10 mega pixels is a lot of mp for the size of the CCD, so what I decided to do is lower the resolution to 6mp (and put the quality to superfine) to improve photo quality. I think that the quality of the photos I have taken in this fashion look good up to ISO 400. Photos still print very well at 4x7 and well at 8x10 just an idea you might want to play with. Its nice however to have 10 mp, if I wanted to make a poster.Two ConsOn FlashThis camera produces flash spots (I don't know the technical term for this). A flash spot is a small circular white dot in the photo that is not in the original scene. It's caused by the placement of the flash in comparison to the lens. One way to try and get around this is simply take two photos of the same scene and hope one does not have a flash bunny. Supposedly this is a common issue with compacts.  This is the main reason I am giving this camera 4 stars instead of 5.On manual settingsYou cannot set the shutter speed nor f stop. The only reason this is annoying is because when I take indoor photos at night the camera automatically sets itself to 1/60 shutter speed. Which might be a problem for dancing shots or photos of my friends that really talk with their hands. However, as of yet all the night shots have been clear and correctly exposed.", "Date": "October 27, 2008"}, {"Title": "Excellent camera - The New York Times was right!", "Author": "Goldengate \"Goldengate\"", "ReviewID": "R2NV3LS54YUVOX", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "There are many reviews for this product with lots of helpful information so I almost didn't write one, but I did want to address a few points.  I purchased this camera because of all of the favorable Amazon reviews and am very happy with it.  The New York Times rated this the #1 camera in 2008 and I can see why.  Lot of features, easy to use, and great quality pictures.Here are a few of the things I was concerned about before purchasing this...hope this helps you:1.  Shutter lag?  Nope, virtually none - the second I press the button it grabs the shot.  And that's with an old SD card.  I imagine the new SDHC card I ordered will be even faster, if that is possible.2.  Gold vs silver?  I wanted to purchase this from Amazon so got the gold color.  It's a very subtle gold and could easily be mistaken for silver.  I was worried it might be too gold and flashy.  The color is more of a champagne color.3.  Easy to use?  Yes, only a couple of buttons on the back, and the auto mode is really all you need to get great pictures.4. What type of media card?  It takes SD or SDHC, both of which are great formats as they are cheap and universal.  That's why I don't buy Sony products as they use a proprietary technology.5.  Easy to slip in my pocket? Yes, slips in my front jeans pocket easily, good size and light weight.6.  Battery charge?  Lasts a good long time - unlike my last camera that had to be recharged at the end of every day.I highly recommend this camera!

This is a fine camera, except that it suffers from excessive noise (even at 80 and 100 ISO) for it to be fully useful.  The 10MP is of limited value, as most of the pixels are smeared by the aggressive noise reduction.  Bumping down to lower MP levels does not alleviate the problem.  Could be a good camera to use in full sunlight or outdoor shots, but not for anything indoors.

purchase the camera as a replacement to my aging second still / main video camera the Fujifilm Z1.My main camera is a Canon Xti but because of it size is not a good day to day, carry everywhere camera.The SD880IS is has a very fast start up time (it has not being an issue in any of the shooting situations I have encounter)The controls are very intuitive.  They maid the two most used controls (at least they have become that for me) the ISO selector and exposure compensation easily accessible.Both functions are just one click away.The camera takes excellent pictures at ISO 80 and 100 and good pictures at ISO 200 and 400.  The Pictures at ISO 800 and 1600 have been the best I have seen in non SLR cameras (Decent and very usable).The click wheel controller is easy to get use to and a very efficient way of getting to the different camera functions.Having a wide angle lens makes the biggest different on this camera that make is superior to the other higher pixel count pocket cameras canon.  Image stabilization is great.  It let me shoot sharp pictures at shutter speeds as low as 1/30 sec.  The other reason I have pocket camera is to use it as a video recorder and this camera makes an excellent job even in low light situations (a lot better than my old Z1).Both David Poug from the New York Times and DPreview.com tested this camera with the other on this category for this year and it was picked #1 by David and #2 by DPreview.  I definitely recommend it as your next pocket camera.", "Date": "December 22, 2008"}, {"Title": "RMA written all over it", "Author": "M.

I read all the reviews on Amazon.com, Digital Photography Review, and Ken Rockwell.  I finally decided that the SD880IS had the features that we wanted.Well, after a week of using the camera, I am very pleased with the camera.  The 3.0\" LCD is very sharp, and the colors are very true to life.  My wife took a picture of an amazing sunset with red, purple, and orange hues.  After taking the picture, she compared it to the actual sunset and the colors were identical.  The Image Stabilization (IS) also works very well.The automatic settings are great for general use, and you have some manual control on some settings.  One of the bells and whistles that we like is the ability to shoot black and white except for one color.Some people have complained of the noise at the higher ISO settings.  Yes, there is some noise visible.  Considering everything that this camera does, and how well it does it, a little noise is not that big of a deal.  If you want reduced noise, don't buy a point and shoot but a DSLR instead.I also bought my wife the Transcend 16 GB SDHC Class 6 Flash Memory Card TS16GSDHC6.  I can't even fathom filling it up.  We can take up to 189 minutes of video and several thousand pictures at the highest resolution.", "Date": "December 14, 2008"}, {"Title": "Great all around camera", "Author": "Federico Hattoum", "ReviewID": "R35Z2FVGG97EVB", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I bought this camera to replace my old SD-1000 (which replaced my SD-660, which replaced an S-330).My first reaction was not positive, only because the camera is larger and heavier than my previous Canons. What I liked the most about my last two cameras was their elegant, light, slim design. The SD880IS is nicely designed, but has noticeably more heft and is thicker.Once I started taking pictures with it, I forgot about the increased size. It's faster than my SD-1000 in taking consecutive pictures, and performs much better overall, especially in low light. Whenever possible, I try to take pictures without flash, because I find the images to be more natural. Because of its more sensitive imaging chip, the SD880IS allows me to take more hand-held low light pictures than I previously could. The increased sensitivity, however, comes with increased grain in very low light situations.The revamped controls took a little getting used to, but quickly won me over. No more needing flicking a switch to put the camera into display mode.If you take any panoramics or landscapes, you'll love the wide angle lens on this camera, which is equivalent to a 28MM lens on a 35MM SLR. The zoom lens, now 4x, instead of the more common 3x in older models, does not actually provide the ability to zoom in closer to your subject. Instead, the additional \"x\" makes up for the wider lens. This means that at full zoom, my old SD-1000 with a 3x lens, and the SD880IS provide the same frame.If the camera were lighter/thinner and produced less grain in very low light situations, I would have given it 5 stars as being perfect.Pros:Faster than previous models.Revamped interface simplifies use.Light sensor more sensitive, more useful in low light.Wide lens, great for landscapes, large groups, etc.Cons:Heavier, thicker than many previous models in same category.In extreme low light conditions, sensor can produce a lot of grain.Requires new battery type (can't use left over batteries from older models)", "Date": "January 13, 2009"}, {"Title": "Great point and shoot", "Author": "Mark", "ReviewID": "R3RMFB12BFLGA", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I got this for my wife who likes to take photos occasionally but doesn't want to fuss much.This camera can take really decent photos.  Like all P&S;, its Achilles heel is flash photography.  The flash is good but you can tell it was used (vs say using a nice flash attachment and bouncing or diffusing it).But I set it so that in the P setting, it is 400 ISO with no flash. Consequently all my wife has to do is switch to P mode with her finger and she can take the same indoors shot with no flash.  With the image stabilization and 28mm setting, that about does it  great indoor shots during the day or evening with no flash.This has a great macro setting in its pre-set scenes that you can easily cycle thru with its iPod-like dial.  You can get about 2\" away (flash is off or at least doesn't seem to fire).The color saturation is nice as is the auto-color balance.  The auto face-detection is funny to see kick in - even if you are taking a photo of a photo, you will see little boxes form around the faces in the LCD.The wide LCD and 28mm really are good features.  It turns on fast, you can set it to take multiple exposures (but I think that will turn off the flash).You can set a lot on it manually - three things you cannot do are: manually set the focus or speed (most P&S; users never would anyway) and adjust the flash with a flash exp compensation.  It has a number of really nice scenic settings - from taking aquarium photos to snow scenes to an ISO3200 for really dark stuff - although it is very grainy. Of course it does video too.The product shipped fine from Amazon.

Image quality is excellent; the 3\" LCD is crystal clear and the controls are very intuitive.  This is one camera that you can use immediately, almost without reading the instructions. I like the wide angle lens, the face detection and anti shake; 4x optical zoom is acceptable. The camera provides the capability to lock in features using the \"P\" mode.  I like the vivid setting and the grid lines which really help improve landscape shooting.  The in-camera red eye correction works very well, avoiding the need to use Photoshop for this common correction. Indoor shots are pretty good but the use of artificial lighting is recommended as a supplement to the flash whenever possible; also, use the \"indoor\" setting in the scenes mode for better quality images.  When shooting video clips, you cannot use the zoom but this minor shortcoming can be overcoming by just walking closer to the subject if you need to \"zoom in\".While this is a matter of personal taste, the gold color, actually a champagne, is very attractive and gives the camera a classy appearance.All in all, a most impressive camera for its size.

I bought a second which I keep just in case in the case.The picture quality is excellent, I certainly can't fault it and the screen is remarkably bright and large.The camera comes with a charger that you plug the battery into directly.  As the camera itself only comes with a 32Mb memory card, I purchased an additional card.  This card coming with a USB stick enabling me to plug it straight into my PC.  Therefore I discovered I needed no cables needed at all.Negatives:Not much, I would have liked a jack for an external microphone.There does not seem to be a wide screen Video mode, though there is for still photos.Summary:By the time I bought an extra battery, 16Gb memory card, leather belt clip case and a table top tripod I had still spent less than $300.00.

Not Excellent", "Author": "Cockypops", "ReviewID": "RAB765HI7IL48", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "For the pixel peeper set and those serious about image quality:The image quality of SD880IS fell a little short of my expectations. My last camera was a Canon S70  (7MP) which is now quite old, but it still produces better per-pixel sharpness, except wide open in the corners, than the SD880IS. Some limitations of the SD880IS for those serious about image quality are1) The DIGIC IV chip will perform noise reduction at all times, even in bright daylight at ISO 80, reducing detail in areas of low contrast; you can't turn it off.2) No manual modes means living with sub-optimal aperture selection, further reducing sharpness.3) The auto exposure is much more likely to clip highlights in contrasty settings than on the S70; be ready to use exposure compensation of -1/3 to -1 to avoid blown highlights.4) Whether it's optics or DIGIC processing I'm not sure (it's not shutter speed), but I frequently have image areas that are smudgy when viewed at 100%, effectively reducing the amount of information in the 10MP file to something similar to a sharp 6MP file.5) The movie mode shows very visible vertical streaking at each specular highlight, not just on the display while filming (not unusual), but on the stored file as well. Neither the S70 or G9 have this problem.With 4 years separating the S70 and SD880IS, I was expecting a real noticeable improvement in image quality. If it's there, it's not very noticeable. That said if you never print > 8x10\" you'll probably not notice these issues.In all other respects, however, the camera performs nicely and shows the progress expected of the intervening years. Speed of operation is good, display very visible in daylight and image stabilization allows one to handhold very slow shutter speeds. Barrel distortion is noticeably lower and CA and purple fringing are better controlled. Flash power is good but recycle times are slow, as is the continuous shooting rate.Given the information available at the time of purchase, it seemed this camera was clearly a good choice (dpreview, NYTimes).

If I were a practical sort, I would immediately select it ahead of other Canon models in the SD series for 2008 as well as 2009.  Not only does it employ Canon's newest processor but it has a lens with sufficient range and aspect ratios to be considered \"wide angle.\"  This means that you can get those tight group photos (which frankly present themselves more frequently than telephoto close-ups).  Moreover, if you're using, say, video mode, you don't want to physically move backwards, taking the camera with its pinhole microphone with you, because that reduces the chances of picking up some interesting conversation or dialogue that could turn out to be as valuable as the visual evidence.  And some of the principles of the old photography still apply: a wide angle lens will give you greater depth of field, thus assuring sharper focus on all of the objects in the picture.  The SD890 has an even wider angle lens than the SD880 and, given the sizable price discounts, is difficult to resist.  Nevertheless, it uses the previous processor (Digital 3 rather than Digital 4), has not been reviewed as favorably by the professionals, and is one of the few Canons to go with a plastic body (no doubt a major consideration in professional reviewers' lack of enthusiasm for the camera).The SD780, lthough touted as the successor to the Lilliputian SD770 and listing practically the identical dimensions, is actually more diminutive than the specifications would suggest.  Even the cardboard box it comes in is 30-40% smaller than the container that accommodated the SD770.  The camera itself looks smaller than the SD770 and is conspicuously lighter in weight.  It's definitely a sexy, sleek, ingeniously designed device that some of us (namely, moi) are apt to fall in love with despite some necessary trade-offs due to its size.  Not a smidgeon of space is wasted on front or back, and it takes a bit more time and practice simply to locate and use the viewfinder.  The flash unit, moreover, is smaller than that of the SD770, and hence slightly less powerful.  The camera is so petite, in fact, that one can't overlook the danger of dropping, misplacing or simply losing it (check for holes in pants pockets before slipping it in). Perhaps the most common misjudgment of many users of these cameras is to equate smallness with convenience: at least initially, patience and care are the key.  When I'm in a rush, a Canon A410 (3.2 mp) is the first camera I go for.In sum, the form factor is the major consideration with the SD780 whereas the SD880 is as much about performance as style.  If you need practical reasons to rationalize selecting the SD780, HD video capability has got to be first.  Since I don't have room to carry a Flip or any other gear in addition to what I already have, I'm using the SD780 as a videocam more frequently than I thought I would.  The results--at 720 pixels--are quite satisfying if not impressive, especially considering the minute size of this mini-overachiever.  As for the 12.1 megapixels of the SD780 vs. the 10 of the SD880, that's probably best seen as a non-factor or mere sales hype.  The SD880 registers less noise in dark conditions than the SD780, which is likely to translate into more consistently stellar results.  All the same, the SD780 is capable of competing with its bigger brothers, especially if a thoughtful photographer holds up his or her end.", "Date": "June 4, 2009"}, {"Title": "Used for Business", "Author": "Wayner \"Energy Dude\"", "ReviewID": "R378XMJQWE19PK", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I bought this camera a few months ago and have been extremely pleased.

Many of the photos that I take are in equipment rooms or even inside pieces of equipment where lighting is minimal to nonexistent and where room to move around in is very tight. The wide-angle lens  and Digital macro modes are lifesavers for me. I installed an 8 GB memory card and it can hold almost 1800 pictures at 10 megapixels each or up to about 45 minutes of video. I don't have to worry about space anymore. I can just snap pictures at will and sort them out later. The photo stitch software that comes with it is also great for taking pictures of a high-rise buildings or a very low and wide warehouse of himand ending up with everything in one photo.

Over all the camera takes great pictures and it takes them fast, so if you have little kids you won't loose those shots when they decide to move. :) I would have given it a 5 if it wasn't for the occasional shot muffed up by the dust orbs....", "Date": "November 17, 2008"}, {"Title": "Kudos to Amazon service, Canon QC shaky", "Author": "T.

Harley", "ReviewID": "R3H11GRS6BGY7E", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I wanted a versatile compact camera in a small package.  I also own the Canon XSi, but let's face it, there are times when I don't want to lug around a DSLR and all of the lenses, so I first tried the Powershot G10.  It was a nice camera, however I experienced a little too much blur, unacceptable noise (especially at higher ISO's), and it was a bit bulky.  So I returned it and decided to get a smaller, less versatile camera with great image quality. After exhaustive research, I decided on the Elph SD880.  I feel I made a wise decision. Image quality is great in just about every shooting condition.  I shot low light, bright light, indoors, bright sun, macro, full auto and program mode.  All performed wonderfully.  My images are sharp with little or no blur (except under certain obvious conditions), and the noise levels are acceptable. Brightly lit shots are usually noise-free, however, things do tend to get a little \"noisier\" as the light fades.  Although there is more noticable noise at higher ISO's, general setting shots look great, and even most of my low-light shots were better than expected.  I would say the noise is on par with my expectations, unlike the G10.  Honestly, my test SD880 images have significantly less noise than the images I took with the G10.  I tried every trick in the book to try to improve the image quality of the G10 (because I really liked the features and wanted to justify keeping it) but 14.7 megapixels is going to definitely reveal any shortcomings.  I know a lot of people think the new Digic IV processor is \"noisier\" in general than its predecessors.  Both the SD880 and G10 have this new processor.  This is my first Canon P&S; since 2001 (Powershot A20), so I can't comment on the validity of that.  However, I do believe you reach a megapixel limit before quality is affected with the small sensors in point and shoot digicams and the SD880 seems to be right at that limit.  If the Digic IV actually is \"noisier\" than preceding digics, then this \"flaw\" is much more pronounced on the higher resolution G10 than the SD880.  I took identical shots with both cameras and the SD880 images were clearer with less noise. My shots look good enough that I feel comfortable saying as a fresh buyer that I don't think the Digic IV is flawed.  It may not be as good as it's predecessors, but it's not flawed in my opinion.  I haven't noticed any significant chromatic aberration and I've experimented several times with challenging shots attempting to trick the camera.  I've noticed it a few times under extreme shooting conditions, but that's to be expected at this end of the camera spectrum.I opted for the silver color because the gold seems a bit garish for my tastes.  The camera is super small, powers up and is ready for the first shot very fast.  I haven't noticed any significant lag time betweeen shots.  For the tiny form factor, this camera performs just as well as the larger and sometimes more expensive competition.  If you're looking for a tiny, pocket camera without sacrificing quality, this is the perfect choice.  I will admit that movie mode was a crap shoot.  I shot three videos.  Two were crystal clear and hard to distinguish from footage taken with a traditional SD videocam, however one was pretty grainy, even in bright light.  The problem seems to be focus.  There doesn't appear to be autofocus in movie mode.  If you begin filming out of focus, it will stay that way for the duration.  It does allow zooming while filming in movie mode, however, it remained out of focus.  Movie mode delivers good results, just make sure you properly focus before pressing the shutter button.Although I sacrificed a few desired features such as RAW mode and additional programmable options, I still think this is the perfect camera when you just want something to slip into your pocket and move about freely.  The large anti-glare LCD is nice and clear, although you might want a soft lined case to protect it from scratches.

I find that it's so convenient that I get shots I never would get with a big camera ... because I have it.

First things first:  the photos are gorgeous!  Beautiful color, vibrant but not unnatural ... sharp as a tack,  clear as a bell, quiet as a whisper!  Of course, Canon cameras are known for excellent image quality.  The wide lens format of the SD880is in a ultracompact camera was a real plus.  And the wide-angle lens was only the beginning of good things.Style-wise, the gold/bronze exterior is understated and very attractive.  The 880is feels sturdy, and is a good weight-light but not too light, easy to hold, designed to be stable in your hand so it's easy to shoot using one hand.  I must mention the excellent controls; intuitive, easy to use.  I like the pillow style buttons and rotary wheel control set-up a great deal.  I was able to jump right in and start using this camera right away.  The viewscreen  is the nicest one I've ever seen ... and shows well under all light situations, even brightens automatically in low light situations.  Although I am used to viewfinders, I haven't missed one so far, because unlike viewfinders which I have found show only a part of the photo, the viewscreen shows you exactly what the picture will be.  With this camera you won't start out guessing and end up editing!  This camera also has lots of special scene choices and user settings (white balance, exposure, etc).  Highly recommended, this camera is a gem!Update 8/10- the \"slider bar\" which chooses between modes-crumbled apart (and no it didn't drop - just from ordinary use) - a year and ONE WEEK after purchase .... and two days before a long-planned trip.

The replacement took even worse pictures, so I returned that one as well. I think Canon cheaped out when producing this new model in trying to sell mass quantities for a lesser price. Shame on Canon for putting out such rubbish! If you want the real deal and the best Powershop Canon on the market, get the SD870IS and you will never look at any of the other models ever again. Just look at all the positive reviews for the SD870IS and you will understand what I mean. As for the SD880IS, all I can say is Get Outta Here!", "Date": "December 1, 2008"}, {"Title": "Good point and shoot", "Author": "Chris Jaronsky", "ReviewID": "R2WFKCS8ZV947J", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I just got this camera and have been playing around with it for about a week.  I formerly had an Olympus and loved it, but everyone who I knew who had a Powershot loved them, so I thought Id's give it a shot.The LCD is crystal clear and I like the dial.  It is fairly easy to get the hang of.  I do recommend reading the manual, though because there are a lot of things this camera can do...I have a tendency of putting my camera in Auto and leaving it there, so please read the book!  I love the Color Accent feature where you can single out one color in the frame and make the rest of the shot black and white.  I like that you can shoot in black and white and also sepia, or focus on a color and make it vivid.I haven't gotten the hang of the other features, for example foliage.  The pictures always seems to come up blurry for me when I shoot in the different modes.  I don't know if I am doing something wrong, but I have read the manual and have followed the instructions with these specific features and if you don't hold your hand COMPLETELY still you'll get a blurry shot...you get a better shot if you just shoot in AUTO.I will continue to play around with all the features and try and master them, but in the meantime I really like this camera and would recommend it to anyone that asks.shelly", "Date": "December 3, 2008"}, {"Title": "Canon's Warranty Program is Defective", "Author": "robwi \"Rob\"", "ReviewID": "RQCQBNRKHRHUI", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "Be aware that if your Canon camera fails within the first year of ownership, you may be charged $109, (\"Flat rate repair charge, + shipping\") to get your camera repaired.

It's been banged around, bumped into things from within my pocket, and even dropped from five or six feet onto pavement, with the lens extended. After 8 months of all this, it still works like new, with just a bit of missing paint on a corner or two to show for its journeys.I've taken thousands of pictures with it, and they come out far clearer than similar cameras (I'm guessing it's the image stabilization). The wide angle is a definite plus, since I really enjoy taking outdoor scenery shots and making panoramas. The battery charger is compact and the battery itself has a very long life -- I think I've only recharged the battery three or four times since I first got it.

Safianow \"Kiddo\"", "ReviewID": "R2B8PZ9JLDQNAS", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "For those who have followed my past reviews, I reviewed the SD600 a couple of years back. Fast forward into 2009, and I have upgraded to the SD880. There are many things that I loved, the more I played with this camera, the less I could find that I didn't love.A lot of things have changed on this camera over the years. The interface is still very similar, but because I don't believe this camera is a direct replacement to my previous camera I had to get used to what was new. One thing that I liked was the scroll wheel by the screen. It let me easily change from Portrait, to Night Snapshot, to Kids&Pets;, and many more. The big 3.2\" Screen made it easy to get the shot I was aiming for, and the big buttons make even people with larger fingers pretty easy.Let me break it down the pros and cons:PROS:EASE OF USE - The selling feature for me. Canon's have always been straight forward. Either you put it one of the many preset lighting situations, or you use the Program mode to adjust everything from White Balance, to Exposure, to Color Palate, to ISO. Like most point-and-shoot cameras, if it is not easy to use, it will not sell well. There are no gimmicks with this camera, no touch screen, to screen that you can draw on, make dialogue boxes, or anything of that nature. Lots of features, wide camera, and great pictures.BATTERY LIFE - Another Canon with great battery life. I have always been impressed with their strong battery life, and quick charge time. You can go through a whole day of taking pictures with or without flash on, with no problems.FEATURES - I'm a pretty simple guy when it comes to cameras. I don't know 32X zoom, I don't need in camera accenting, I don't need over complicated features that I won't use. I know Photoshop, so I just need a camera that does basic things, that takes fantastic pictures. This camera does exactly that. You do have some cool features, Color Accent, Sepia, B/W, Macro Focus, Stitching (not like a full panorama picture, but aids in editing for later), and ISO up to 3200 (although I don't recommend it). The image stabilizer works very well, had great face detection, and a pretty good red-eye eliminator. The zoom toggle is easy for those used to Canons, and the camera focuses very quickly after you reach the approximate zoom you were trying to achieve.SCREEN - Amazing screen. Very large, vivid, easy to see during the day, and at night. Lots of colors, clarity, and great video playback.EFFICIENT - Lightning fast start up, probably one of the fastest I've seen in a point-and-shoot. The whole point to a point-and-shoot is to be able to POINT and SHOOT. And you can do that with easy without missing your shot. The continuous shooting is fast, but not the fastest, but the lag between shots is very short.LOOKS - Just a great looking camera. The front of the camera is classic Canon, and the black is a gorgeous black with glossy buttons that looks sleek and modern. Everything about this camera was very familiar to me, from how to get the battery and SD card out, to turning it on, putting the wrist strap on, turning Macro on. Everything was just the way you would want it.CONS:NO VIEWFINDER - I am personally indifferent about a viewfinder. My SD600 had a view finder, and all it did was collect dirt. I never used it, but for those that are old school and like the viewfinder are missing out on that.NO INTERNAL MEMORY - Most cameras today are starting to come with internal memory. I am once again indifferent. I prefer taking the SD card out and loading it directly into my SD Card slot. Because I can change out cards, if I fill one of them up, I can quickly put a new one in there without having to worry about filling up all my usable space.NO HD VIDEO - This does not give you the option for High Definition video recording. The video recording in this camera is pretty decent, but a lot of the cameras have 'True HD'. Their True HD however, is not True HD. It is on a higher resolution, yet on a point-and-shoot camera, this usually isn't the dealbreaker.SIZE - A little thicker than my SD600, and definitely not as small as the SD1200, yet it is the right size for what I use it for. It is a little bigger than my palm (my actual palm, not a Treo), but the buttons are the perfect size for people with thick fingers. It will fit decent in loose jeans, but some of the tighter jeans and shorts, you might have to just hold it.BOTTOM LINE: Overall, this is definitely worth every penny. The price has gone down from $349, so there is a lot to offer. Every time I get a new device, I get a happy feeling, and this one did not disappoint. I am very happy with the camera, and can confidently say this is the best point-and-shoot camera for the money.", "Date": "June 14, 2009"}, {"Title": "Awesome Camera - 28mm Lense Is What Every Indoor Shooter Needs!", "Author": "L.

The controls are all intuitive and easy to use.  The pictures are sharp, and the colors are extremely accurate, in most situations.I'm personally impressed with its ability to take photos in low light conditions, where most family type pictures are taken.However, the star of the show is the 28mm lens!  When people purchase a camera of this type, they are mainly looking for one that works well indoors for such activities as birthdays, candid shots of the family, family reunions, graduations, etc.  This wide angle lens will take in most, if not all of the action.The 10MP lens is more than enough for excellent photos of all sizes.  It would be nice if the Optical Zoom was stronger, but it works in most situations.  I recommend turning off or not using the digital zoom on any camera because it usually causes blurry photos when not on a tripod.All-in-All...Nothing but \"Thumbs Up\" for the Canon PowerShot 880.

When you're in that mindset, this little camera excels!  It has several interesting preset modes that allow even a beginner to take extraordinary images.  My favorite preset is the Digital Macro mode.  This allows you to be able to focus on objects that are VERY close to the lens.  Be careful:  You can focus so close that you will have to make sure you don't bump the lens on your subject!The wide-angle lens is more practical than the telephoto end of the spectrum, so I would get this camera again in a heartbeat when compared to even newer variants of this camera.  The wide angle lens on this camera will help you capture family gatherings, holidays, and stunning landscapes.The camera has a nice telephoto range, but its practical application is limited.

The rotary pad Canon put on the back is perfect. All cams should have this.Now most importantly, the image quality is spot on for a camera in this range. It's no D_SLR but thats NOT the point here. You can pull this camera out of your pocket and get a really good looking shot with no fuss. The wide angle, F 2.8, and IS really help this thing shine.

My intent was to go back to Canon as I had an Elph (non-digital version) before and I felt like the pictures/color were brighter and more defined. Also, I had compared my boyfriends 8 MP Canon pictures of the ocean and others from our January '09 trip to the Riviera Maya to my Coolpix and there was no comparison in colors, his pictures were so much better. I intended to get an 8 MP as I primarily take photos of my daughter and don't need anything that fancy. I wanted something with a faster shutter speed to catch those moments with children when playing.  The two salesmen at Best Buy talked me into this camera showing me how it has continuous picture taking abilities - perfect for kids and moving objects. At 10 MP and one of the newest and higher priced models I wasn't sure, but bought it anyway. (I had gone there for a different Canon on sale, (the 1100) but they talked me out of it). Anyway, I came home and before using it researched the internet to find other user comments (which were mixed) and Amazon was by far the cheapest \"reputable/known\" site and there was no sales tax or shipping charges. The no sales tax saved me about $25 alone living in Chicago at a 10.25% sales tax rate.  Anyway, this camera is nice - the 3\" LCD makes me a bit nervous because it is so easy to damage if you are not careful, as it takes up almost the entire back of the camera. The one thing I really DO NOT LIKE about this camera is the video feature. I constantly take videos of various things - mostly my daughters dance or swimming class, but the video is terrible! Not only is it very grainy the microphone for the camera is right next to the zoom button.  So, if you need to zoom anything, you hear the noise of your finer scraping back and forth across the speaker/microphone. You can use the video okay if you don't need to zoom, but any zooming expect a grainy picture and the noise. I bought a Video Flip to carry in my purse separately to alleviate the issue. Also, I know I went from 4 MP to 10 MP, but plan to buy at least a 4-8 GB SD memory stick because my 1 GB was useless after a few weeks (without videos). Finally, don't get the camera case that goes with this camera. The snap on the inside for the way you need to put the camera in goes against your LCD making the possibility to scrape or damage the LCD highly probable. Also, it has no storage for extra battery or SD card if you are one to carry a spare.  Had I not dropped my camera and really needed a new one right away, I might not have bought this camera, but it will do for what I need it to do minus the video. Hope this is helpful to you.

The camera works well with a PC or Apple MAC. ( We have 3 Apple Mac's in our house, but I tried it at work with a PC. ) Canon's warranty and support is excellent. I have had other Canon cameras repaired by Canon and they were fantastic.I have not tried or used the included software as I use the Apple iPhoto software for working with photos.I highly recommend the Canon HF-DC1 High Power Flash accessory for this model or any other Canon pocket cameras if you intend to take many indoor shots. The built-in flash only goes about 10 feet. The external flash can go up to 30 feet and be used in creative ways.I highly recommend the new Canon SD880IS. It is an outstanding compact camera.

I compared them with my A530's pictures which I owned for 2 years. The SD880's pictures are blurry, the objects' edges were not sharp & unclear, The wide-view feature twisted the objects on both sides of the pictures. The colors were not as bright & nature as A530's. Another thing was \"not easy to hand hold it\" & easily mass up the set-up by touching the bottoms unnoticed.But Amazon was nice enough to let me returned it a week ago.

I could take 5 or more pics to capture a neat action such as your child jumping up and down or spinning. Smile detection was a nice feature but wasn't fast enough. Then I tried the fugifilm finepix (i can't remember which model) great zoom, but blurry pictures and this camera took atleast 4 seconds from the time I pushed the button until it actually took the picture (in low to mid lighting) So, it was out! A professional photographer recommended the Canon ELPH for a point and shoot camera. So, I bought this one. So far so good. Fast, good quality pictures, rare blurry pictures, wide angle zoom is nice, a few features I wish it had...is the continous shooting, a bigger zoom.

I also found the color to be not as vibrant as my old Canon digital. I had my photos taken under Program at 200 ISO and White Balance at Daylight. Also took photos inside all on Auto.I wish Canon would go back to a good solid 6 or 8 mp non-complicated point and shoot. I don't need all the bells and whistles.

I will stay away from some of the traditional, confusing jargon that I ran across when agonizing over reviews when I purchased this camera. My family has owned one digital camera, this is our second.  We wanted a good all-in-one solution that we could use for trips/special occasions.  We had a Canon before, which lasted for 4, almost 5 years before the LCD went out.  I was pretty pleased with our last one and Canon earned a seat at the table of consideration when it came to buying a new one.  Here is the bottom line:Things I like:Color Swap & Color Accent Functions28mm wide angle optionPillow Top Button Controls (unlike other Canon models I considered)Quiet Zoom when shooting videoAccompanying softwareThings I would improve:More optical zoomAbility to film video in more formatsWrist strap is tricky to attachThe one thing I can say is that I haven't really had the opportunity to run the battery down, so I can't speak to battery life....yet.  I have also not mastered the iso settings for night time shots, so I can't speak with a great deal of knowledge about those.One suggestion which I would offer you is to consider how much the accessories cost with different brands of cameras (memory cards, replacement batteries, etc....). Some companies require special memory cards that or more expensive or their battery costs are excessive.  This model's low cost of ownership (that's what I call it) and Canon's reputation made it an obvious choice.  It's the same principle I employ when considering a good printer....how much the cartridges cost, etc.....

Compare cost of this camera with that of the Panasonic Lumix DMC-ZS3, which has most of the necessary features found on this or any other camera.

I've played with the SD880 for all of a day, so I can hardly add much to the previous detailed reviews.  I have a digital SLR already (Canon 5D) but it's heavy and bulky, and I've found a need for a pocket camera I can take everywhere, when I don't want to lug around the 5D.  Plus I can use it as my (only) video camera.The SD750 was nice - I took it to Italy when I bought it as a pocket camera.  In the SD880 I looked forward to a wider angle lens and Image Stabilization - two glaring issues I had with the SD750 (where I NEVER seemed to be able to get far enough back).The SD880 seems much more responsive (faster processor) in interactive use than the SD750 and of course takes nice pictures.  However, one HUGE disappointment is that the SD880 does not have a \"time-lapse\" movie mode!!!  Time-lapse may seem like a gimmick if you've not used it, but I found it incredibly fun on the SD750.  When in Italy I used it with my tripod to record some fun videos such as tourists at the Leaning Tower of Pisa, and that was my favorite video shown to my friends from my trip.  I may have reconsidered my purchase (or gotten last year's SD870 instead) had I known this feature would be removed - I just assumed this would be a standard feature since it was in the old SD750 and is still in their other consumer cameras.

The image quality is excellent for a camera of this size.  The extra features are nice, but there is a learning curve and you should read the manual that comes with the camera before trying to use the settings.

Not sure if that is because of the battery itself or if the camera is using more power than normal.

The features I use the most are very easy to get to and switch between on-the-fly.The image quality is very good in good lighting. As with most low cost consumer cameras the quality of the pictures goes down drastically in low light if you don't use the flash or have a tripod. This camera does have an ISO 3200 setting which will get you images in low light without a flash... which has been very helpful in live performances where use of flash is not allowed. There is alot of noise in these images, but not as bad as past versions of the camera. Overall the picture quality and color is very good for most applications.Most everything I look for in a 'point-and-shoot' is represented in this camera. The battery lasts a really long time between charges. The memory card is easy to change out. The different shooting options I use most are quickly accessible (macro lens, ISO, flash/no-flash, stock lighting defaults, video, manual vs. auto modes). The metal housing is great. The zoom is better than previous versions of the camera, but I try not to use much because image quality is compromised quickly, especially at maximum zoom. The size is perfect, not too big or small. Its easy to get your finger in the way of the flash, so I have to be mindful of that.Overall, this is one of the best cameras I have owned and it would be a tough sell to sway me away from this line of Canon cameras.", "Date": "April 27, 2010"}, {"Title": "Very happy with this purchase & Canon's customer service", "Author": "nik456", "ReviewID": "R1TQ3Z38PNQLRL", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I purchased this camera 6 months ago and am very happy with it.

So thats great.  We don't mess too much with settings and aren't very experienced photographers.  But our DSLR takes considerably better pictures and lightning fast compared to this sucker.  But we expected that.  We just wanted something smaller as well as something we could record video of our daughter with.  The great thing about recording video is it can be as long as your memory card can fit.  The bad thing is the horrible placement of the mic.  It is exactly in the spot your finger wants to rest - directly next to the record start/stop button.  It's a ridiculous design and one that's given us movies with no or extremely muffled sound.  We've learned to keep our fingers off the mic - both my wife and I had to learn the hard way though.  Also when recording video, sometimes you can zoom, sometimes you can't - no rhyme or reason to it.Another thing that's likely unique to ours is a purple spot appeared on the LCD during a trip to Hawaii, right after we bought it.  It's permanent - seven months later it's still there.Pros-Very portable - small, light and fits nicely into a shirt or pants pocket.-Takes decent pictures, better than most in its class.Cons-The worst possible location for the mic.-Zooming during recording videos usually doesn't work.-Slow if you're comparing it to DSLRs.

I take off auto flash so that faces don't get washed-out but if your subject is moving, you'd better leave auto flash on so that the picture doesn't come out blurry. If you take off auto flash, then the camera has to leave the shutter open longer and this means you have to hold it EXTRA still in order to get a clear shot.

For someone such as myself who will red eye in about every picture this is an excellent tool.Physically the camera is impeccable, the folks at Canon really know how to design an aesthetic device. Optical zoom while filming a video would be a great addition, however. One piece of advice if shooting a video is to avoid the zoom feature at all costs unless you zoom BEFORE you start recording.

I take pictures because I want to see the things in my life, not to create art.  I like to have some control over a few features (a mode setting, shutter speed, flash, zoom) but I'm pretty much a pick-it-up, point and shoot guy.  I actually read the manual for this camera (front to back!) and I owned an earlier model Canon PowerShot from a couple years ago.  All that goes to say that your experience with this camera might be different than mine if you're different than me, if you know more about cameras or if you have the time to research the issues (I note that many of the very favorable reviews of this camera come from people who seem to know a lot about cameras).My main beef with this camera is that the pictures are very fuzzy and blurry.  I've tried all the pre-set modes (it has a bunch, many more than my old Canon - Fireworks setting, Aquarium setting, Snow setting...) and they all seem to involve fairly long shutter times, so the pictures tend to range from slightly blurry or hazy to downright fuzzy - if the subject moves at all, or if you are not completely steady, the picture is compromised, regardless of the mode you use.  This problem is much worse if you turn off the flash, which I do quite a bit because the camera autoflashes even if the lighting is ok but not great and, if you're within 5 or 6 feet of the subject, the flash will completely bleach out the picture (faces are just bright white blobs).  The camera seems to automatically slow down the shutter speed even more without the flash on, so the problem of blur becomes worse.  I think this would proably be ok if you tend to take \"staged\" pictures of things that don't move much (adults, landscapes, etc) from places where you can have a good steady hand and time to concentrate on being still, but I take pictures of my kids, and I usually only have a split second to catch them and no time to concentrate on steadying the camera.  This camera is just not good at that.For the non-photographer, the manual setting menus are virtually incomprehensible - I tried to use them to get past this problem and haven't figured them out at all.I give this camera 3 stars because I assume there must be a way to solve this problem if I just knew more about the camera or spent more time researching it.  My wife, who's about the same level of sophistication as me with cameras, detests this camera and is about to buy a different camera even though we've only had this one for a month and a half.  All in all, I would not buy this camera again - I'm sure it's great for some things, but it just wasn't meant for someone like me.UPDATE:  I recently tried to print pictures from this camera of my new daughter, between month 2 and 5.  It turns out that the camera has a setting that takes ultra low resolution, thumbnail pictures (like 70kb images).  Our camera had inadvertently been put on this setting, and I couldn't print any of the pictures, even on basic 4x6 pictures - the resolution was too low.  I suppose that we, at some point, inadvertently changed this setting, though my wife and I don't remember doing it and certainly didn't know what we had done.  My point isn't that this setting is inherently bad - with as cheap as memory is, I personally would never use a setting where I knew in advance that the pictures, no matter how good, could never be used for anything other than putting on Facebook, but I suppose some people might.  My point is that a camera designed for ordinary users should not allow you to change to this setting without making sure you wanted to do it and understood what you were doing - it should have warnings that clearly spell out that you won't be able to print the pictures.As I mentioned before, I think this camera is good for a camera person, the people who like to spend a couple of quiet evenings bonding with their camera, studying the manual, taking a bunch of practice pictures, experimenting and unlocking its mysteries and idiosyncracies.  But if you want to take it out of the box, charge the battery, spend 10 minutes on the manual and then take good pictures without issue for the next 2 years, then I'd definitely recommend against buying this camera.", "Date": "December 1, 2008"}, {"Title": "Beware! You might be one of the unlucky ones too!", "Author": "RH \"TimeTravelerer\"", "ReviewID": "RWB4LWCHJ20F5", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "We did a ton of research before buying a camera...read review after review of cameras on amazon and other camera selling websites, checked consumer reports, etc. This camera has an overwhelming number of positive reviews and rates as one of the top cameras on consumer reports. Now, I always like to read whats being said thats negative, so of course I did pay attention to the 1 star and 2 star reviews as well; however, after reading many of those I was of the opinion that there was a small percentage of cameras in this series that might be faulty but what are the chances I'd be one of the unlucky ones to get one!? After all--look at all the positive reviews!! Well, guess what!? I'm one of those \"unlucky ones\" and I could not be more disappointed because I really was hoping to recieve the quality so many others on here have described.When researching cameras I looked for the following before buying: clear and precise pictures, decent movie mode, quick response (I have toddlers!), and ability to take good pictures in a medium to low lighted setting (with flash off). I would give this camera a one star rating but decided to give it a two star rating only because when taking pictures outdoors, I have gotten some really clear and precise shots that are wonderful and the movie mode is pretty decent (although, zoom is not great in movie mode but if you read the manual, it does suggest holding the shutter down until the subject comes into focus before recording and I think that does help somewhat). The thing is, I already have those things with my Olympus C-60 which is several years old!I think the most disappointing thing about this camera is the indoor shots. They are absolutely worthless regardless of if you have the flash on or off (washed out, grainy, lots of noise, low clarity)!!  I hate using flash because I feel like it washes out the shot and distorts true colors (which, by the way, this camera is a culprit of). But when you take the flash off, the pictures are very blurry. Of course, you can change the iso which helps to reduce some of the blur but then the pictures become grainy and washed out (that is at 800 iso--anything above that is downright horrible and anything below, there is too much blurring). And, if you do use the flash, the flash is very weak. Even close up in a medium lighted room, the subject is more than likely only partly illuminated and there are some very dark spots on the picture where the flash does not reach. By the way, I've tried tinkering around--using both auto and program settings. Nothing seems to make much of a difference.The response time is also disappointing. There are certain settings you can put the camera on to get faster response time when taking pictures; however, those setting are not always convenient depending on time of day/ subject/ place the picture is being taken.Going back to outdoor shots...again, this camera will take some decent outdoor pictures--not consistently--but a large majority turn out very nice. Here and there I do find shots to be washed out by sunlight. I haven't tried going outside of \"auto\"...I guess because I figure whats the point? It's not the camera I want it to be anyway, its never going to be perfect no matter how much I mess with it, its a lemon! Like I said, the majority of outdoor shots turn out nice anyway on auto.Like other reviewers have mentioned--buyer beware! It seems to me like it must just be bad optics or electronics or whatever that is making a some of these cameras into lemons. If you want to take a gamble at getting one of the good ones then go for it. I suppose it prolly could happen with any compact camera you buy--all those little tiny pieces, working together just right--there are bound to be some bad ones among the good ones. I'm going to send this one into Canon and see if anything can be done but I'm not holding my breath. It sounds like even if they do work to it, there are no guarantees that I'm going to get a better camera back. It's just so disappointing, all the research and effort I have put into looking for a good, compact camera and in the end the worst case scenario has come true.Oh yeah, and I cannot believe the price these cameras are being listed for now on amazon!!!

They design cameras with great options (especially the infinite panorama mode, and this is the only camera that allows so many shots that you can make enormous panos), solid builds, and reliable quality of construction.  Incredibly, their image quality has gotten WORSE with each passing upgrade of their DIGIC software in the camera.  I would advise going to [...] to get an idea about how consistently Canon point-n-shoots are polluted by noise.  It's as if they went with the most generic, cheap jpg processor on the planet to put in their cameras.  No matter how good the lighting, the noise is obvious on viewing on any large screen computer monitor.  In suboptimal lighting, the images are terrible.In a nutshell: Don't get this if you want quality images (which I do).Pros: Size and construction quality are great.  Plenty of options to select scene modes of choice, very limited options (understandably) for custom image adjustment.  This is a camera, like the Casios, meant to be easily pocketed so it can be with you at all times.  It's hefty, though- but that's a good thing.  Better stabilizing of images when you hold it, and it's solidly built.

So after looking this up online, I was like, \"WOW COOL GLOWING REVIEWS YAYYYY\" -- but I guess because this camera is so new, there aren't enough REAL reviews from users who have had a bad experience with this.Let me tell you this.The SD1000 delivers crisp, gorgeous images, while the SD880 is SPATTERED with noise and pixels! It's embarassing! I really don't like this camera. I feel like I could've just bought a crappy little fujifilm finepix z100 and had to suffer through the same thing (which I already have, by the way, and that camera SUCKS OMG. The noise is even WORSE on that LOL)!!I lose a LOT of cameras partying. Haha10mp on the SD880 vs 7.1 on the SD1000 does not always equal a BETTER camera. In fact, increasing the MP actually INVITES more noise into your pictures, giving it a grainy, rough feel instead of a smooth, pretty image!I really feel like I've wasted my money. I should have just gone with the SD1100 or the SD1000. *SIGH*Probably the only thing nice about this camera is the CONTINUOUS focus. Meaning, when you hold down the shutter button halfway, you can still move the camera around and it will continue to adjust its focus for the movement and different objects entering the image. Also, the LCD screen is MUCH larger.But why does that even MATTER when you're just going to load these up on your computer anyway?? And you can basically just zoom in and blah-blah-blah.Plus, this camera is MUCH fatter than the SD1100 and SD1000.ANOTHER downside to this camera is the position of the microphone!WTF?!Which genius decided to have the microphone directly under your finger when you're hitting the shutter button!? It produces crappy scratchy noises and makes it incredibly inconvenient to shoot. I can just IMAGINE handing this camera to one of my friends during a party without them knowing about this, and having them screw up the ENTIRE movie because of the location of the microphone!
