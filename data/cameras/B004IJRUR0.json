I asked if they could replace it. I'll update when I get an answer.If you are running wireless internet where you set this system up, the camera signals WILL cut off your G wireless signal..now I have to figure out how to get around that.Overall, the package you get is impressive. Complete kit is plug and play..if it all works. The cameras are fully articulaing, metal encased, but does NOT come with mounting hardware (screws). The signals are ok, but if you have them too close together, they will interfear with eachother.I gave it a 2 star rating mostly because of the non-working camera and that because the cameras have to be so far apart to work clearly so I cant get an optimum view of the areas I want to monitor. I'll keep it, but not happy.**Update same day. I got a form letter email from ther seller saying to return the \"Item\". Clearly they did not know that I wanted to replace just one camera. So, they didn't even read my request.I did, however, take apart the non working camera with a small phillips screwdriver. After pushing in a few connectors to re-set them, the camera just started working. I put it back together and now its fine.Again, this system will interfear with your G wireless router.Also one of the cameras, the #3, has to be within a few feet of the reciever to get a clear signal.I'm basically happy/not happy with it. Its doing the job I need, but I still give it a 2 star.", "Date": "September 6, 2011"}, {"Title": "thought it would be more then it is", "Author": "Bobby", "ReviewID": "R1X3CFFMUV3YCQ", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "so far so good don't have anything to say bad about it. but the sellers need to let people know you can't hook it up to your computer you will need to buy parts to get it to do that and it don't record either", "Date": "April 3, 2011"}, {"Title": "bad receiver already", "Author": "akdoggie", "ReviewID": "R35BDI6TWY20KC", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I bought mine last spring, hooked it up and had only 3 of 4 cameras working.
