Having used the waterproof cameras with the rubber bands in the past, the design of the Hero was refreshing. Be sure you use it when the light is good (I usually surf as the sun comes up and goes down). I've gotten some surprisingly awesome photos with this camera. Two other recomendations - be close to your subject (objects in photo are closer than they appear), and be sure to keep your \"o\"- ring clean when switching film. Otherwise, have fun...I have.", "Date": "April 14, 2005"}, {"Title": "Coolest camera ever!", "Author": null, "ReviewID": "R2PB23MLND527X", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This camera rocks. Super light, easy to use...I love it! For $19.95, I can't believe it. The pivoting neoprene wrist strap is perfect for sports. Finally someone came up with this camera so I can easily shoot photos while I mt. bike and surf. I'm hooked. GoPro, thanks!", "Date": "April 12, 2005"}, {"Title": "Not bad for the price", "Author": "RCKTQWN \"RocketQueen\"", "ReviewID": "R5798MFE4T0JA", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "I wanted an inexpensive underwater camera for our Caribbean trip...I must say I was pleasantly surprised that this camera never leaked. The pictures we took didn't come out too bad, but they weren't great. I'm not sure if a flash would've been necessary, or possibly a zoom? The fish and coral pictures weren't great, but the sea turtles came out pretty good. Love the wrist strap...everyone else was struggling to snorkel while holding their cameras by the strap. Strap this to your wrist and you don't have to worry about it, just flip it up to take a picture...also helps to steady the camera. If you don't want to spend a lot of money for something you may only use a couple of times, give this camera a shot!", "Date": "July 18, 2007"}, {"Title": "Worked Great Until It Broke", "Author": "Cathrine E. Taylor \"Chatty Cat\"", "ReviewID": "R5PJ1HQMGH9RG", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "I bought the camera to take pictures in my pool of swimming students.  At the end of each session of swimming we give them a picture of themselves swimming in the pool under the water and they love it.  The camera took great pictures for 5 roles of film.  On the sixth one, the part of the waterproof casing used to advance the film broke, so the only way to take pictures now is to take the camera out of the case, advance the film, put it back in the case, take one picture, and repeat the process.", "Date": "August 10, 2006"}, {"Title": "Great for the price!", "Author": "megbot_423", "ReviewID": "R21JXOA7BSJTLU", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "For a cheap camera this is great. It's never leaked, easy to use, and fun! Take it anywhere you wouldn't take a \"real\" camera! I haven't taken that many underwater pictures, but it's great to use on canoe trips or inner-tube floats. Just strap it to your wrist and don't worry about it! Picture quality is not bad.
