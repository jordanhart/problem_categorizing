{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Fast, hassle-free shipping for a new in packaging item", "Author": "Emma Sallee", "ReviewID": "R2QX12M33DJCQ0", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "The rating is contingent on the camera working well, but being a film camera I see no reason why it shouldn't.The item came in brand new packaging, which is great.The camera is a little bigger than I thought it was going to be, but should still be okay for my five year old.She looooves taking pictures and I think she's going to love this.The shipping was fast and hassle free, my only complaint is that USPS nearly destroyed the shipping box, one corner was entirely torn open (but I left feedback for that as well).Overall, minus one star for the carrier crushing my box, but I'm pretty happy with this purchase and I think my daughter is going to be one happy kid on Christmas. :)", "Date": "December 10, 2013"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": null, "Features": null, "Name": null, "ImgURL": null, "ProductID": "B00008ZCGQ"}}
