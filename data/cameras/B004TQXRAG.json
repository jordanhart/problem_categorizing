{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Hidden Camera Termometer DR", "Author": "Hicoteo", "ReviewID": "R12THLBNHE21E4", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I bought this because it can be left on standby for up to twenty days on a full battery charge. I haven't found another hidden camera that can do that. I use it at the ranch where we only spend two nights a week. If anyone breaks in when we're not there, this camera will identify them.Its very basic, works well and the video quality is good. There is a little button on the back to turn it on and off. It would be better if the button were on the side, though. When it's turned on, any movement activates recording. It will record for as long as there is movement or stop two minuets after the movement stops. I wish is stopped recording thirty seconds after the movement to save memory. Since this camera is motion activated it works best in a place where there should be no movement. For example if you place it in a window the swaying trees could activate it and fill the memory.I haven't left it for the full twenty days yet but every time we return it is still working. I plug it into the laptop to charge it and there are usually two clips on it. The two-minuet clip from when I turned it on and the one from when I turned it off. Last time there were about five clips. The motion sensor was probably triggered by the shifting shadows through a window. I wish it had a delay so I could turn it on and get away without activating it. Copying the files to the computer takes a lot of time so I just view them right off the camera and then trash them.I had to go to a web site to download a time program to set the date. Now that it's installed, every time I plug the camera into a computer the date and time resets automatically. I suspect this program should have been saved to the memory at the factory but wasn't.It may be a bit pricey but it works well. I don't feel it's that cheaply made either. Its plastic but I actually find the thermometer useful and refer to the humidity gage regularly. Best of all it gives me a piece of mind when we are not at the ranch.Aug. 24/2012 Note: Once the memory is full it will not write over old files, it just won't record. So, be sure to erase old files or you may miss something.15/09/12: My on-off button just got pushed in now, too. It still works though. I wish they made a simplified version of this - One that last for 20 days but is better quality without the thermometer. Can't find the web site with time program.22/08/13: It's been a year and a half and its still working. You can pry the back off and glue the button down again if it gets pushed in. I still like this thing and wish they made a better quality one with the same technology, maybe in the form of a little picture frame or fridge magnet. This should also reduce its price.", "Date": "February 29, 2012"}, {"Title": "Horribble instructions.", "Author": "TammyJean", "ReviewID": "R1WG1ZHER45TBZ", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "I ordered 2 units;When I got the boxes today I plugged the first one into my computer to load the battery and I found about 500mb of videoclips of (chinese?) people, very weird.I deleted those and was going to make no fuss about it.Then I found the button on the particiliar unit was all crushed in, so I contacted the company and asked for an RMA to return, they responded quick.The paper with instructions is horrible, the English looks like a direct internet translation from the language on the other side (chinese?) I asked for a manual in English so I can make sense out of it, otherwise I am going to have to sent the other one back too.There is a horrible \"beeeeeep\" in the recordings.", "Date": "March 24, 2012"}, {"Title": "place it where light is", "Author": "t", "ReviewID": "R3UMI76TYD6AAK", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "this item does work. the instructions are kind of hard to understand. i will rephrase them for u a bit. to turn on- press A for 3 seconds, you will get a long red light (its now in stand-by mode). to activate camera to record constantly: press B for 3 seconds, red light will flash 2 times then go off (now its recording). to stop recording: press B once and quickly press A while the light is flashing(the light will flash 2 times when pressing B and 4 times when pressing A). ((pressing A saves the file and stops recording)). To turn off: press A for 3 seconds. you can now plug into computer and go to (computer tab under start button) to view recording. and now for motion detect recording. to turn on- press A for 3 seconds, you will get a long red light (its now in stand-by mode). press A (red light flashes 6 times) now its in motion detect mode. press B to stop the motion detection (red light flash 6 times) then press A (red light flash 4 times then u get a long red light) stand by mode. press A for 3 seconds to turn off. plug into computer to view.  the distance/range for this item is not very far. maybe 15feet i guess. measurement taken inside house going from room with light to one with no light. maybe its better with a lot of light. picture quality is great upclose. audio works on this also. i dont know about the battery life yet. dont know about putting it outside yet. i will do that. will update on other functions later.", "Date": "December 16, 2012"}, {"Title": "rip-off this is the x-205 thermometer available for 40$", "Author": "Angelo Haltric", "ReviewID": "R39LHFWR70SZXE", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "Everywhere I look for this x-205 thermometer is not more than 40$.For over 100$ it is very cheaply built.My bad I did not research it before buying.", "Date": "August 24, 2011"}, {"Title": "Does not work as advertised.", "Author": "Jackie B.", "ReviewID": "R2BPWG1I33IEKW", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I ordered this to put at my 80 Year old Mothers door to monitor and hopefully catch whomever has been ringing her doorbell and terrorizing her at all hours of the night. Put it up and left it for about 2 weeks. Sound and video was good quality however, it was not motion activated as shown. It stayed on continuously until the battery ran down. Also, contrary to the instructions, I could not set the time and date. Instructions were horrible and I'm pretty techie but this one just was impossible. I'm returning it even though it is over the return period,  just hope I can recoup some of my money.
