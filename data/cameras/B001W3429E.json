If they know enough about cameras/photography I will delve into all the details about why it is so different and why I love it so much. But for those friends who are less knowledgeable I just tell it to them straight - \"no it can't zoom, yes it's only 4.6MP, yes I paid $650 for it and it's worth every penny. It takes beautiful photos.\" I spent some quality time with this camera on a recent trip to Victoria, BC and here are my pros and cons:PROS1. Amazing image quality (pixel-perfect sharp and colors are especially stunning. Always shoot in RAW)2. Small (likely to fit in any coat pocket)CONS1. Sometimes you will miss candid opportunities because autofocus and shot to shot times are not super snappy. If you tend to be a \"capture-the-moment-trigger-happy photographer, this will probably get on your nerves. If you are more of a composition photographer, it likely won't.2. Low-light autofocus is a bit useless. Pop it into manual.3. The lens cap sucks. Really, Sigma. It needs to be tighter.4. Some say the LCD isn't bright enough for sunny conditions. I personally didn't have a problem seeing the info I needed to see to properly set up shots. But it is certainly not as well-suited for reviewing shots.I may have listed more cons but for me the 2 pros far outweigh them. I list them so others know what they are getting into. This is not a camera for the masses. Then again, maybe that's why I love it so much.", "Date": "May 31, 2009"}, {"Title": "Meanest little camera you'll ever use", "Author": "R. Li", "ReviewID": "R3T338KZCKQ1TJ", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "There's a ton of technical reviews of the camera, and I can't add anything more to that discussion. I 100% agree with them, noisy at high isos, slow, etc. So let me give you my \"every person review;\" for background the Sigma DP2 has become my everyday camera, I'm taking about 5 pics a day; things I see that's interesting, or just to document something happening e.g. bad drivers. I've logged well over 200 shots on this camera, since I also go to events and pretend to be a photographer in my spare time. So I feel comfortable, about offering my review after only owning it for 2 weeks.This camera, is the meanest, most abusive, slowest, frustrating and confusing camera you'll ever use; 4 out of 10 times, you have no idea what it's focusing on. Sometimes, it treats the the shutter button press as a suggestion not a command. Also when you ignore it, sometimes it just crashes.However, it will take some of the best pictures you'll ever see. Some how the colors pop, look more 3 dimensional than any other camera I've ever used. Images just seem more life like and clear. Other than futzing with white balance (it always seems slightly off), I don't have to edit the pictures coming out of this camera.When shooting indoors at night, you'll need to learn how to use the manual mode, even with adequate lighting the camera always seems 3 or 4 seconds behind what ever you want to take. Usually the focus doesn't work. You'll also have to get used to using the flash, if you're like me a person who hates flash photography the higher ISOs are practically useless (unless you don't mind converting them to Black and white). Even so, out of the 3 tweet ups that I've used this camera at, the pics I take with the Sigma (when they turn out), by far are the best compared to all the other photog's there. Even beating out some of the Canon and Nikon dSLRs. Again, color's pop, the lens is so clear its spooky and some how it just feels closer to film than traditional bayer CCD/CMOS sensors.FYI It isn't anywhere close to being 14 megapixels, RAW files have a remarkable ability to zoom and crop but it's closer to 8 or 10 megapixels. This isn't a bad thing, think of it like film, you don't wonder how many megapixels there are in the film you're using.Also, you can't hand this camera to a regular person to \"here take my pic\" I've tried it, and the camera for some reason has performance anxiety. It's slow reaction time, ends up with a lot of pavement or sky shots, and its slow focus confuses the average on the street person.As a side benefit, I'm finding my subjects act more natural when I take their pics (street photography) using the sigma instead of my Rebel SLR. Some how they're more comfortable, until the sigma acts up and i have to say \"hang on, sorry, my camera is acting up.\"In case your wondering, YES it is alive. Treat it nice and you'll get amazing pictures, use it in a way that is slightly wrong and it'll make you pay. I love it, i'm not trading it in, but I hope to FSM that the DP3 will be less temperamental and hate me less.  If you do buy it, get a spare battery, power adapter and a good case. I'm saving to get the leather case.[...]", "Date": "July 8, 2009"}, {"Title": "sigma dp2", "Author": "Steven R.

I wanted a go everywhere camera.The auto focus is slow - the manual focus is not so great because the lcd is not so great. Maybe the viewfinder will help. I'll buy one soon because despite the faults this camera is worth keeping.Dont buy this if you want to photograph people - the auto focus is too slow.There is just something about the photos this camera can take. When the focus is bang on its great. But its more than that. These pictures don't look like photos taken with other digital cameras.I put them into photoshop and need to do nearly nothing to them - especially the B&W.;Use this camera if you can use an slr. Use this camera if you have patience. Don't use this camera if you want a quick auto focus.If you can be patient and if you can put up with slow(ish) write times you will like this. If you are used to an slr and want a walk aroud , you will love this.This is a great point and shoot but not a point and shoot for somebody who can't use an slr. In terms of sharpness etc it may not be better than some others - the panasonics/ leicas, the g10 etc. However, the photos this produces make it stand apart from them. The dymnamic range is great. But its something about the colour and the contrast. I have used all the named above so can make that judgement.I really wanted a digital rangefinder and coudn't afford one right now. This is not a leica or even an epson but these pictures have a certain chartacter in the same way that rangefinder images do to me. They don't compare, no question of that - but I have not been disappointed. These are not your usual digital images and I love them for it. They may not be leica images by a long way but there is still something unique about them that makes them stand out and they are undoubtedly comaparable with some dslr images.I love film but also love the convenience of digital. So I use alien skin etc in photoshop. To my eyes, this is giving me something of the halfway house with minimal help from photoshop.Give it a go if you are prepared to take your time and dont want quick auto focus and particularly if you want something against the grain, that stands apart from the usual crisp, clean digital image; an image with character earned by the camera and not just by photoshop.If you can use a cmaera you can make good with this. Not a point and shoot for someone who wants a simple point and shoot. You can find quicker and cheaper point and shoots. You will get the most of this if you understand the basics of camera controls, have patience and appreciate film.", "Date": "June 7, 2009"}, {"Title": "A small camera that captures the beauty of this amazing world", "Author": "D.

In my opinion, this camera does a better job in capturing details and colors than many DSLRs. I am always pleasantly surprised by the pictures it makes.2. Size and weight. I take it with me almost everyday. It's impossible to do so with my once owned D90.3. Control system. The buttons and menu are well designed, so changing settings is simple and quick.4. Look and feel. I know some people will not agree, but this is just my opinion.5. Manual focus function. It's good, but not perfect. With firmware 1.02, I have to press the OK button to magnify the focusing area. I hope the focusing area will be automatically magnified when the focusing wheel is turned.6. When the ISO is set to auto and the flash is not used, the ISO will not go beyond 200. (Firmware Version 1.02)What I think is not too bad:1. Auto focus system. Yes, it is a little slow for shooting actions. That's why I have a vidiocam. I set the AEL button to AFL, and allow half pressing the shutter release to do AEL.2. LCD. I don't like to use a camera screen to check the detail and color of my pictures anyway.3. Focusing noise. After using it for a few weeks, I think the noise is funny rather than annoying. To me, it sounds like a hen in my hand.What I don't like:1. Relatively short battery life. I hope Sigma will make a bigger battery for DP3.2. The shutter release is a little stiff for such a small camera. Easy to introduce camera shake.3. No image stabilization.In general, I love this camera.", "Date": "August 19, 2009"}, {"Title": "Much better than previous efforts", "Author": "John Muehlhausen", "ReviewID": "R28SYHUP3OZ4R", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Having owned all of the Foveon/Sigma cameras other than the DP1, I can say that the software and reliability are much improved in this product.Previously, I felt like I had to fight the controls every step of the way in order to get amazing photographs... but I did get amazing photographs.  With the DP2 I feel like the controls are working with me rather than against me, for the most part.This is not a camera for someone who doesn't want to futz with it... definitely not for the \"point and shoot\" crowd... if you think about your target depth of field, etc, then this is the compact camera for you AFAIK.I haven't tried the Leica compacts, which I have heard great things about... mainly I'm addicted to the lack of strange artifacts with the Foveon sensor in the Sigma line.

Ihde", "ReviewID": "R11H6IPKTT47CM", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I have had a little over a week to get used to my DP2 and I am thrilled with it.  I also own a Canon 50d and am happy to say that this little DP2 outshines the 50d in terms of photo quality.  Of course the 50d has its obvious advantages of more frames/sec, interchangeable lenses, etc.  (Yes I am using L lenses 135f/2, 200f/2.8, 300f/4 and 400f5.6)  But, in just over a week of use I have gotten images with the DP2 that otherwise would not have been obtainable.  I don't know what disadvantages can negate that.  I will still keep the 50d for sports, action and so forth.  But when I want to catch that beautiful sunset, or colorful close up there will be no question which camera I will reach for.  If I want to pack a camera along for a bicycle ride the DP2 will get the call.  If I don't want to walk around making a spectacle of myself with a canon body and L lens, but still want to record professional photo's, the DP2 will get the call there too.  So on, and so forth.The only complaint I have with the DP2 is the short battery charge time.  I attribute some of that to shooting in RAW format and the large file sizes to transfer to the memory card.  Never the less the batteries should stay charged longer in my opinion.I have heard complaints of the LCD.  I am scratching my head because I don't have a problem with the LCD at all.  In fact mine is turned down to one notch above the dimmest and I still use it in bright sunlight to focus.  I only do that to preserve the battery time.  Even that is sufficient for me to use in broad, bright daylight.In short, I grew up with a Pentax K1000.  With the Pentax I had to think about what I was doing with the camera.  If I messed up it cost me in time and in film and I learned.  What I learned made me appreciate the art of photography so much more.  The DP2 is a similar camera.  It will make you think about light, exposure, ...  If you care to spend some time with this little gem your photography will soar.  If average snapshots at 8 frames per second is your thing, then this is probably not your camera.One last comment, use the DP2 in RAW format.  Thats where it truly excels and it is beautiful.****************UPDATE FEBRUARY 2010*****************************I thought so much of the sensor in the DP-2, I purchased the SD-14.  The SD-14 is an equally capable camera with the benefits of using SLR lenses.  I compared the SD-14 to the Canon 50D I had.  After seeing the results, I sold the Canon equipment I had and now happily own the DP-2 as well as the SD-14.****************UPDATE OCTOBER 2010******************************The DP-2 Continues to amaze me.  No other camera gives me the thrill that this camera does.  Why the update?  Today I saw on amazon the DP-1s is to be had for $300.  Do I need another DP camera?  No. But to get this Foveon sensor with a wider lens for such a bargain price I punched the BUY (One click) button.  YIKES I believe I've got Sigma GAS.

When I say this, I mean it in a way different from what many others meant here.  It seems chief source of complaint is the camera's overall slowness.  This does not bother me at all.  It has always puzzled me why people complain this camera is slow when they almost never complain the same thing about manual focus camera such as a Leica M8 or an M9. Unless prefocused, manual focusing is almost always slower than automatic focusing, no matter how slow automatic focusing is. The fact that you missed a shot is not excused by that you were holding a manual camera any more than that you were holding a slow automatic. And make no mistake, this camera is not so slow as to miss too many moving objects at \"normal\" speeds.  It is of course slower than a DSLR, but for ordinary daily use, keine problemo.My agony stems from this camera's post-processing software.  Not that it is in any way flawed.  Far from it.  It is a tremendous software, so easy to use and so convenient.  The best thing about this is that you can have as many customized settings as you want and simply let it run the whole folder for automatic conversion.  You will find for most photos this conversion will take care of itself and you won't ever need individual touching.  But it may take a while to find the ideal setting combination as there is no guidance.  You would have to experiment and find the combination that you would like for MOST of your photos through trial and error, and this process could be very tricky and time-consuming.  If you cannot find the right combination for you, you will be frustrated.  The colors will look either too gaudy/unnatural/saturated or too mundane, the picture will be either too bright or too dark, etc.  This is really the crucially important process, I find, and I suggest that you search discussion forums in the Internet for a guidance.The operation of the camera is superbly simple and convenient.  Manual focusing could be used in all modes (eg in program mode, in aperture priority mode or in speed mode) just by pushing one dedicated button and turning the dial.  Most important settings such as ISO/flash/WB/exposure are all in one specially designated button. Exposure compensation is easy as it is done in one step.  Auto Exposure Lock (AEL) is very useful and has its own button.  Battery life is good enough (200+ RAW shots).  One oddity is that Auto ISO setting works only between 100 and 200.  Considering that this camera produces eminently usable results at ISO 800, Auto ISO should be allowed to go up to at least 800.  Another feature I like is that when you go into the menu button, do certain things, exit and then you go back to the menu again, it remembers where you left off so that you don't have to scroll through the entire menu list again.  A thoughtful feature.  Same for AEL - it remembers the last exposure obtained by pushing of the AEL button until either you push it again or you take a shot.  The camera has certain analogue smartness and lacks digital stupidity, rendering its operation intuitive and simple.  Unlike many electronic cameras these days, this camera does not have a bunch of features that people almost never use but rather seem to focus on the core set of useful features either in one-step or two-step operations.When you shoot in RAW (it is a requirement; otherwise don't buy this camera), process it with the right combination of settings, the image result could stun you.  Almost as good as a 1:1 DSLR and certainly more exciting.  Yes, better than a GF1 or a PEN PE1 (I have used both).  Very close to film cameras (film scan or slides).  The colors are alive and kicking.  Don't take my words for it -- just google seasoned professionals such as Julie Mayfeng (India & Nepal works) or Carl Rytterfalk who swear by this camera.

For a while I have been looking for a camera that puts image quality first in a portable package.

It clearly puts image quality first and produces astonishing images for such a small package.  Focus is not lightning quick, the lcd screen is not the sharpest, the control system is not elegant, but it is more than enough to take excellent photos.  The image quality rivals, is perhaps better than, many DSLR cameras.This is a camera for someone who understands photography and not someone who is looking to quickly and mindlessly capture images.

Sarte", "ReviewID": "R155993V2DQENT", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I've been shooting with 35mm, 120, and Canon full-frame digital SLR's for a long time.  I've never used a Foveon based camera prior to owning this DP2.  I can honestly write here that I'm astounded at the image quality coming out of such a tiny box!  In fact, I'm so impressed that I've made up my mind to pick up Sigma's SD15 once it becomes available for purchase.  The pictures are just that good.The camera itself is a bit quirky.  I won't go into technical detail here.  If you're after a technical review, check out the DP Review.  I will note what I've found odd or inconvenient.  First, the lens is great - sharp corner to corner with no CA and minimal distortion BUT it's slow.  It's faster than the DP1's wider lens, but slow compared to some of the lenses I'm used to working with (50mm F1.2 Canon prime for example).  This makes shooting in low-light conditions problematic, especially when it comes to focusing or using low ISO's to minimize image noise.  If you want to shoot in low light, use a tripod.Another gripe is that the AF system is slow and loud.  The loud I don't mind so much, but its slowness relegates the camera to shooting mostly static subjects.  In other words, dynamic street photography (for which this camera's physical size would be perfect for) can be an exercise in futility.  The AF accuracy on the other hand has generally been very good when it does lock on.  I haven't noticed too many OOF pictures, even in low light.The LCD screen could definitely be improved as well.  Manual focus using the screen can be a bit tricky due to its low resolution.  On the other hand, it works pretty well outdoors contrary to what some have said, and I find its color and contrast rendition to be pretty decent as far as tiny LCD's go.The DP2's battery life can also be improved.  I've only shot in raw mode, and as such only manage to get 70 or so captures before the camera tells me to recharge.  I think a second battery is definitely a need.Finally, high ISO performance can still be improved.  50 to 400 ISO are definitely usable.  800 ISO can work depending on conditions.  1600 to 3200 ISO are useless for color photography, but can yield some interesting results when converted to black and white.Now I've mentioned what I thought needs improvement.  Here's what doesn't: Image Quality.  The IQ is stupendous.  I haven't seen this level of color accuracy come out of a digital camera before.  Ever.  Foveon's X3 sensor lives up to its claim when it comes to color detail and rendition.  The images coming out of this camera are very close to film.  If you've shot a lot of film before and miss that look, then you should definitely consider trying one of these cameras out.  You'll be pleasantly surprised.Below are a few links to sample images I've taken with this camera:[...]Please stop by my gallery and check out the rest of the pictures.

But by no means I wanted to deal with bulky DSLR equipment and for that reason I purchased Canon A620 three years ago which gave me all manual controls in a compact body. As I became more comfortable with Av, Tv, M, and P modes, and other features of photography, I became aware of some limitations of P&S; cameras especially around depth of field and grainy quality at low light. I wanted to expand my capabilities but still didn't want to deal with bulky equipment. After extensive search on-line, I was intrigued by the picture quality of this little camera Sigma DP2. It seems to be exactly what I was looking for - very unique and artistic tool, very different from any P&S; but without bulkiness of DSLR. I was not looking for a replacement to my P&S; but rather an addition for those creative moments when I wanted to \"think and shot\" instead of just \"point and shot\". This camera fills the bill perfectly. After owing it for just two weeks, I have already built a small collection which I want to watch every day. I've put it on my screensaver at work and my colleagues are just thrilled by the quality of my pictures. Everybody comes and asks which DSLR I used to make these shots. It is just amazing. I don't know exactly how to describe the feeling I get from looking at the pictures; it is very similar to the feeling I get from the 24P \"cinema\" footage from my Canon HV20 camcorder.Yes, this camera is light years away from perfect in terms of software quality. For that reason I am taking away one star. Even after upgrading to 1.02, my camera freezes more often than I even expected (after reading some other reviews). This is probably the most disappointing thing. I don't care too much about slow focus or lack of zoom as I don't have the intention to capture every single moment around me. And even if I miss a \"great\" shot, not a big deal, there will be plenty of moments in the future. But I am totally amazed by the pictures I can produce and would buy this camera again if something happen to this one.Bottom line, I think this camera is worth a try as an addition (not a replacement) to either P&S; or DSLR. It guarantees a lot of excitement despite all it's quirkiness. I hope Sigma will keep developing Foveon technology and improve the quality of their software. I will definitely consider it when decide to upgrade again.", "Date": "July 30, 2009"}, {"Title": "Worlds first fun digital camera", "Author": "GOAT \"Goat\"", "ReviewID": "R3KPBZIPLWVZP0", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "If you've heard about this camera you probably already know the pros and cons of the unit so I won't elaborate.I haven't had this much fun taking photos since I was on film", "Date": "September 24, 2009"}, {"Title": "The magic is back!", "Author": "Thomas J. Schum", "ReviewID": "R31CUWAXY0HOEH", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Years ago I had a hobbly while in high school: I developed and printed my own black-and-white photographs.  I quickly learned that a good photograph is the result of carefully dealing with the idiosyncracies of the camera, the film, the photo production process (developing, enlarging, cropping, printing), and of course the subject matter.  I got into digital about 10 years ago, finding things to be similar to film except: no smelly chemicals and no media costs.  At first I was enthralled with the new method and eventually took a few very nice photos.  More recently I bought a Canon EOS 30D to try for some serious hobbyist-type artistic achievements.  That camera has its strengths and I do not intend to get rid of it, but in working with it for a few years I began to percieve a weakness:  the \"filmlike\" sense seemed to be absent from my photos, but I couldn't really be sure it was the sensor.  I had heard about the Foveon sensor when it was developed about 10 years ago, but for a long time I held off buying something so \"different\".  Now that I have a Sigma DP2, I am sure it was the sensor!  The DP2 sensor surpasses the bayer sensors found in other cameras, giving me photographic results that are, to me, filmlike.  There is an unmistakable smoothness and immediacy to the images.  At feature edges, I've seen no artifacts except for those rare cases when a feature beats with the sensor pixel pitch.  Even these artifacts do not have the harsh rainbow look of those in my Canon.  Looking at a photo is no longer like looking at a TV image printed on paper, it is so much more like looking at a photograph!  The magic is back!  I spent time living with (learning) this camera.  Pros who make money with photography will not like it because there is a significant learning curve.  The sensor has its idiosyncracies, as does the camera.  The photo production process (using the Sigma raw viewer) is not quite exactly the same as with the Canon raw viewer either.  Mastering all these details is highly worthwhile in my opinion, because of the wonderful results you will get.  After living with the DP2 for a while, I find it easy to use.  The sensor does not like low light as much as the bayer sensor in my Canon 30D, or long exposures (slowest shutter speed is 15 sec, but I don't recommend using that slow a speed).  The sensor saturates easily, so I usually shoot with -0.7 EV to reduce this problem (I can fix this later using the raw viewer).  Color fringing on a detail can occur when the sensor is near or past saturation but you really have to be looking for it to see it.  The lens is breathtakingly clear and sharp.  Manual focus works like a dream (a good dream, not a nightmare as some have reported).  When using manual focus there is no shutter lag.  No one is intimidated by this camera either.  One of the nicest features of the Sigma DP2 is that once you have set up the shutter release for a 10-second lag, the camera will not reset that (or any other of your settings) if you power down.  I found it quite annoying that all my other digital cameras reset stuff when you power them down.  If I could run my Canon 30D like the Sigma DP2, I would much prefer it because I think Sigma has put a very good user interface into the DP2 system.  Finally, after experiencing the results from the Sigma DP2 I don't think I will ever buy another bayer sensor camera again.  If I get a new SLR in the future it will probably be a Sigma SD15, in spite of the sizable investment I already have in lenses for my Canon 30D.

Was really excited to see the pictures.To my disappointment, the item arrived with a crack... when I looked at the LCD for the first time, I noticed a weird \"spiderweb\" artifact.  At first I thought there was just some dirt on the lens... after some looking, its obvious they shipped me a defective unit.  (The crack is not on the LCD, its in the imaging path... either the lens or sensor as the spiderweb shows up in the pictures... the outer lens appears intact so its internal to the camera)  Imagine looking through a piece of glass that was shot by a pellet gun... that's what they shipped me.The 2 pictures I took looked amazing, if you ignore the fact that there is this subtle spiderweb on every single picture.This is going to be a great product, but Sigma needs to take a serious look at their quality control.  This should have been easily caught.  The item was well packed, and does not appear to have been damaged during shipment.  How you ship a $650 camera with such an obvious defect baffles me.---------------------------------UPDATE:Got the replacement.  Had some time to get used to it a bit.  So my background... I'm not to familiar with photography... so I might not be the target customer for this, and some of my comments might be my lack of knowledge.Anyways, for such a small size, this thing can definitely take some amazing pictures.  What I noticed is especially in well lit situations (outdoors) where you've got alot of different light (reflections, sun, shade, etc) the pictures really pop out at you.  In mid to dark light, it takes more work.My biggest gripes... I don't like the LCD.  Its very difficult to do fine tuning when viewing through an LCD.  This makes some of the settings difficult to tweak (especially the manual focus) because you are tweaking below the noise floor of the LCD.  If you there is light on the LCD, it makes it even harder.  Its not impossible, it just takes some practice.The auto focus works fairly decent, and the flash has a reasonable recharge time.  Zoom would have been nice, but you know going in you won't get that feature with this camera.I'm still practicing, but I'm fairly happy with it.

Handling is the worst I've experienced.The lens width/radius is big and extends so much during power-on, much like a Point & Shoot Zoom cam.  It is not exactly pocketable at all especially when you include the lens cap and included Sigma bag.The battery charger, makes a scary hissing noise the first time I charged the battery. At first, I thought it was the battery sounding like it's going to pop or explode.  Leaving that way for an hour, the noise weakened.  It's probably due to a drained battery.The LCD is not small as I expected from reviews,  what made it bad is the resolution or video mode, as though, interlaced video (i suspect due to the included analog A/V cable).  It is not accurate, as one will need it to be, to use manual focus well.  The edge detail in the screen needed for accurate manual focusing gets interlaced.Manual focus is very much needed.  It has trouble auto focusing under indoor lighting such as fluorescent light even at F2.8. Skill in estimating distance during MF will be useful.The image preview is less useful for this high image quality camera.  The white balance is never accurate, the picture appears too sharp, contrast is too high, and incorrect color saturation.  I deleted about three pictures on first use and thought my settings are wrong.  I quickly noticed the bad pics continued despite various settings. Uploading it to SPP, the pics were great and just needed white balance tweak.Flash sync speed is not specified.......since it syncs to shutter speeds up to 1/2000!!!  Love it!It is proof that flash is very fast and only lengthens the flash duration to sync with a camera's shutter speed. I'm excited to test it using an external flash and under bright sun.Anyways, use it all the time to save flash/battery power, adjust aperture for correct exposure.Use SPP version 4.1, at least.  It can utilize the second processor core in your computer, so it is noticeably faster since it is very slow.Overall, this purchase is a very good one for me.  I bought it at 429.99. Image Quality per Price ratio is the highest (just made that up).  This is not a poor man's Leica, this is even better in terms of image quality.  Not fun to use until you see the results.

At the moment I shoot with a Leica M8, Dlux 4 and now the Sigma DP2 acts as a backup to my M8 when I need something compact.  The images from my M8 shot with lenses like the 28 Summicron, 50 Summilux, 50 Noctilux, and 90 Summicron, are by far the most impressive I have seen coming from any camera, be it digital or film.

Let me just say that this is all you expect it to be in regards to image quality, quirkiness and slow performance.If, however, you've stumbled upon this camera and are unsure about what makes it special, let me briefly introduce you to it: Sigma cameras have Foveon sensors that work different to anything else in the market. Most sensors use a red-green-blue array of pixels (50% green, 25% blue, 25% red), where each image really captures only about a third of the photographic information: light comes into the sensor, depending of its wavelenght it gets picked up by either the red, green or blue pixel, and that's the only color information you'll have. This is how 99% of the cameras work today and years of engineering have made this approach a safe bet that works pretty well. Sigma is different. Their Foveon sensors are not structured in a red-green-blue pixel array, instead there are three layers of pixels: a ful layer of green, another one of blue, and another one of red pixels. This allows each pixel to record absolutely complete light information per each pixel, since the light will penetrate all three layers of color per image captured. In comparison, the Bayer sensor only captures about a third of information and \"wings it\" with the missing 2/3 by guessing what the correct color information should be (this is called interpolation).On paper, it sounds like Sigma's sensors should be much better than anything else, since there's no interpolation through which to invent/guess colors that were never captured as it happens in Bayer sensors. Right? Not so easy. There's 2 problems:1) The 3 layer stack structure of Foveon sensors means that light gathering works different than the single layer in a Bayer sensor, hence it's quite easy to get amazing greens (top layer) but reds tend to suffer a little bit (lower layer). By no means to Sigma cameras give you bad image quality, but it's sometimes harder to get their images to where you want them to be, you need to know what you're doing. Another disadvantage that even to date hasn't been fixed, is the fact that by not having 1 layer perfectly exposed to light and instead having 3 layers where 2 are further from the light than the top layer, sensitivity noise is a problem for Sigma cameras from ISO400 and above, there's no way to get around this technologically (for now). The 3 layer structure also has a marketing quirk: when a Bayer camera mentions it has 15MP, you should know these are not real 15 megapixels because of what I just explained: the 15mp spatial resolution is divided roughly by 3, so there's about 8mp green, 2.5mp blue and 2.5mp red. Still, due to the checkerboard pattern, the image you get will be, spatially speaking, 15mp large (but as you now know, those aren't really 15MP, it's more around 2/3 that amount since the other third of the image is basically made up and not real detail). Since Foveon sensors are 3 layers stacked, it's effectively a 5mp green, 5mp blue and 5mp red configuration, which means that although the image has 15mp of information, spatially, the image only stretches to 5mp.2) As I said earlier, Bayer sensors have received most of the market's attention so far and have evolved greatly. Sigma is the only player to produce 3-layered sensors, and thus their progress has been much slower. This means that Sigma cameras tend to have many less features and technological advances than their Bayer counterparts, since Sigma isn't big enough to compete with Sony or Canon. However, make no mistake: 3 layered sensors are the future, and the fact that both Canon and most importantly Sony are getting these kinds of sensors ready to be marketed in the next few years proves it.So, should you buy a Sigma camera? It depends. If you want amazing crisp and clean image quality at low ISO values, if you don't need to take really fast pictures (these cameras are kind of slow) and you can put up with the quirks and uncomfortability of these cameras, then by all means BUY these cameras. You'll get amazing pictures that you would only get with much more expensive Bayer sensor cameras at a fraction of the price, but these cameras will make you WORK to get those images. These are not point and shoots, you need to know what you're doing with regards to ISO, aperture, etc. Personally, I bought both a DP2 and a DP1 and I'm delighted with both of them. While for all-around performance/quality my NEX 5N is untouchable, when I want something even smaller that takes great quality pictures I never hesitate to take the Sigmas with me.

The Sigma Photo Pro software (which I find very easy to use although it takes a bit to get used to) coaxes the most out of their RAW format and I love the results. There's an indefinable quality about the APS-C size Foveon sensor output. Maybe it's the color or the sharpness... 12x18 inch images print exceptionally well.Handling: What I'm not crazy about is the speed of autofocus on the DP2. Yes, it is a bit faster that the DP1 but not enough that you won't lose shots with it. No, it's not a point-and-shoot, so maybe this camera is not for you. It's not really for spontaneous action (unless perhaps you use it in manual/zone focus with the accessory viewfinder). It's for photographers that have the time, style, and inclination to wait, to plan or anticipate the action (landscapes, architecture, still lifes, flowers). It's not perfect for portraits--capturing those fleeting expressions will be a challenge. Having a viewfinder helps, but again, it all depends on your style and what kind of images you want to make. Focusing manually gives you the advantage of a magnified view but the 2.5 inch 230,000 pixel LCD doesn't make it easy. The LCD is fine for reviewing images but a chore to use for manual focus and very difficult to see in bright light.Biggest pluses:* Full APS-C sized Foveon sensor.* f2.8 lens is sharp.* Image quality is excellent.* QS (Quick Set) button is fast an easy to access to change ISO, quality, and formats, etc.Biggest hinderances:* NO IMAGE STABILIZATION* Slow AF* Black engraved text on black buttons impossible to read.* When auto-rotation is enabled vertical images are magnified to the same narrow original width, window does not expand. Poor planning from Sigma.* MOVIE mode is useless because lens does not change focus during recording manually or on auto. Previewing movies is impossible because it plays back tiny, at 1/4 the LCD area.Conclusion: Excellent image quality hindered with slowness.

I own & use Pentax K20 and quite a few lenses to go with it. On a number of occasions I did shoot with various Canon DSLRs  (with several lenses, including Sigma's own) and I own (or owned) quite a few compacts. The latter includes eg. Fuji F40fd and F50fd - naturally, with the Fuji's Super CCD but not quite or at least not fully observable in practice claims about sensor's performance. Similarly about the other cameras. So naturally, I was more than a bit skeptical about Foveon's .This Sigma DP2s camera is exactly what the company writes about it - well, when they do not say that it is 14 megapixels.  IMHO- this camera indeed has unmatched color fidelity/resolution, coupled with exceptionally good quality lens. And all this in a literally pocketable format. Camera  produces images which can be viewed at 1:1 pixel level without any loss of quality. In fact, the images frequently can \"survive\" scaling up to ~ 1.5 times with still quite acceptable result.Despite what I read about this camera, I am absolutely happy with its interface/menu/buttons etc - it is very intuitive & anyone with DSLR experience will not need to study camera's manual or memorize a long list of confusing menu commands. And again - it weights very little and literally fits in the pocket. At the same time giving you a  DSLR - and frequently even better-  quality. It makes almost prefect photos, leaving the photographer with no doubt as to whom to blame for a not-quite-good result -with this Sigma you would know that it was not the camera...This particular model has only one serious limitation - 4 megapixel sensor. This size coupled with the fixed lens leave no room for cropping. Thus relatively minor mistakes in composition of the original shot frequently result in the image which is too small to be of any value.  There is a real 14 megapixel \"DP2 Merill\" version of the  camera on the market, though.Of not serious (minor)deficiencies - battery life is not brilliant and sufficient for only (?) ~ 50-80 shots. However, there are ~ $5 batteries on the market, they are small light so I usually carry an additional one or two with me. Camera's RAW format is not supported in the version of Photoshop I use. The company's software for RAW processing is in fact not bad at all - it is not fast but not too slow either with decent number of processing options.

The image quality is amazing.3. The software is the key to the amazing images.4. The auto focus is not as slow as everyone says.  It is slow, but usable.Ok, so about the software;First, it is pretty easy to use, start with the auto setting, then as you adjust the settings, it switches to custom to preserve your adjustments.  These adjustments can be saved with names and used for subsequent photos that were taken in the same conditions. This is very good. Be sure to use the white balance, to get the best results. I also found that setting the color balance from Auto to sunlight or shade or whatever the setting was, helps a lot with getting a nice result.  The marking of under or overexposed areas is also very helpful. The DP2 has a lot of extra room to handle over exposure, but not underexposure, so you are best to overexposed a bit.So, the software is the best I have seen, and it can also be the worst. What I mean by that, is that it can be very unstable when dealing with high ASA noisy images. SigmaPhotoPro 4.0 has problems with the noise reduction software that causesit to crash when trying to open these images. Sigma is working on it, but it has problems.When the noise reduction software is working, it is wonderful, but it doesn't always work. When it works, it removes the noise from the dark areas of the image perfectly. Sigma should allow the noise reduction to be used at low ASA setting, AFTER they fix the crashing.I am still learning how to use it for HDR photography, but I think it has great potential. The DP2 will shoot three shots AEB automatically with the self timer which is great for avoiding tripod vibration, over a 6 EV range.My commentary on the sensor is that it may be low resolution, but does upscale to an image that is of 8-10Mp quality.
