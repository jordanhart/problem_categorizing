It was garbled.", "Date": "August 1, 2007"}, {"Title": "Plastic Scam", "Author": "Nik Willmore", "ReviewID": "R1Q1S87T25BVO0", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "Not only is this thing all plastic with FIXED levers that are merely decorative, if you look at the product image carefully you'll see a HUGE black plastic black box on the back of it which even kills the cuteness factor of it.
