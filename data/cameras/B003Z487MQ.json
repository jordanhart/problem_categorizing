They stopped recognizing the mouse, then video out started rolling and finally stopped seeing any hard drive I put in. NO SUPPORT, basically a flawed design..", "Date": "June 28, 2012"}, {"Title": "Decent hardware, lousy software", "Author": "Glenn M. Muller", "ReviewID": "R1KY1HKDI93PDA", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Hardware worked well out of the box and was up and running in minutes. Using the DVR over my ethernet connection was challenging due to issues with the ActiveX controls needed to run the viewer in Internet Explorer. No support for Firefox or Chrome. The Software CD was blank, the manual is very poor and not written in proper English. After days of tinkering, I was absolutely unable to record on motion detection only. I called the US customer service numbers and they were both disconnected. The H264 video files are impossible to play on my PC no matter what player or codecs I download. It's a decent piece of hardware for the money, but the software will leave you frustrated.Since the original review, I did contact someone who spoke English and I have the software working properly. The system is a good value for the money. I would consider purchasing again.", "Date": "May 16, 2012"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": "$289.99", "Features": "Video Input / Output: BNC 8/BNC 2 plus VGA\n500GB SATA HDD for recording\nRecording Mode: Continuous/Scheduled/Motion\nDisplay Mode: Each/All/Auto Switch/Hidden\nRemote Access: LAN or IE Browser", "Name": "Zmodo 8 Channel Security Surveillance Digital Video Recorder with built-in 500GB hard drive for Recording and Monitoring - Remote Internet Access", "ImgURL": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/31P6XlmB3ML._SY300_.jpg", "ProductID": "B003Z487MQ"}}
