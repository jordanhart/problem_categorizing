I got all that and more with this camera. Since there are plenty of \"expert\" reviews, I'm not going to say anything about the ins-and-outs of the camera. So, for what it's worth, here are my random comments.1. Besides the 30x optical zoom on the SX510, the other cool feature is the wifi capability. Setting up the wifi was not particularly intuitive, but I eventually got everything working. I read one review from a mac owner that the wifi would not transfer pictures wirelessly from the camera to the the Apple computer. That's not true. All you need to do is download some Canon software (available here: [...] Once you download and install the software, you need to connect your computer to the camera via your home wifi network. Again, this isn't very intuitive, but it's not too difficult either. After the connection is made, you'll be able to transfer photos from the camera to your Apple computer via the \"Image Sync\" command.2. One reason I decided to get a new camera (I upgraded from an older Canon Powershot, the S3) was because my old camera took terrible pictures indoors and in low light. I read that the SX510 did much better. To my untrained eye, this certainly seems to be the case. I took a couple of indoor pictures that turned out very poorly on my S3; using the SX510, the same shots were significantly better. On close inspection, I could see some \"noise,\" but relatively speaking, the differences were huge.3. The SX510 is very compact and light. One big reason, of course, is that it uses a proprietary battery, rather than 4 AAs. A lot of people prefer AAs for obvious reasons, but as long as you are prepared, the proprietary battery should not be a problem. You can buy extra batteries online (on Amazon) for a very low price. Having extra batteries will help you avoid those sad situations of not having batteries when you need them.Well, that's all I can think of for now.", "Date": "December 25, 2013"}, {"Title": "Great Camera", "Author": "Les", "ReviewID": "R3GN1FXDS1M8O4", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I have the professional Canon 5D Mark 2 camera with all the lenses, flash filters and everything else, but I needed a small camera for riding my motorcycle to events.

I was really surprised at how small it is but it does take a nice 12 meg picture. For the price, I can't imagine using anything else.", "Date": "September 26, 2013"}, {"Title": "5 Stars so far, truly impressed", "Author": "LoveMyKindle! \"Amy\"", "ReviewID": "R1RVSOAXJO2JV0", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Wow.  This is a truly amazing little camera.  I bought this to replace my Nikon Coolpix.  I had my coolpix for just over 12 months when it broke, due to no fault of my own, and it was going to cost $150 to repair.  Rather than repair a camera that I liked but didn't love, I decided to make a new purchase.My initial intention was to purchase a Canon Rebel, I have used my mom's in the past and really love that camera.  I loved using the interchangeable lenses and the ability to manually focus.  Seeing the cost though ($500+,) plus the cost of additional lenses, it just wasn't in my price range at the moment and I needed a new camera urgently.  If you're looking for a DSLR, do not expect this to function the same.  It's a powerful little camera, but it is NOT a DSLR.  If you're an amateur photographer and have no intention of taking a class to learn how to use the functions of a DSLR, this is a perfect camera for you.So began my research.  It became a toss up between the Canon SX510 and the Nikon L820.  Reviewers were split between the two, some preferring the Nikon, some preferring the Canon.  They seemed to come out about even except in a few minor categories, and having been very pleased with the Canon Rebel, I decided to go with the Canon despite it costing about $30 more than the Nikon.Pro's-*30x Optical zoom - awesome, no more grainy pictures of kids on stage during performances*Built in wifi - go ahead and upload your pics to facebook, send them to your phone, or directly to your wireless printer.*Manual setting - can do your own iso settings, white balance, shutter speed etc.  The auto setting works fabulously in most cases, far better than any camera I've ever owned, but the option is there for those times it's just not adjusting quite how you want it.*CMOS sensor provides for a clearer image, especially on the macro setting, than my own eyes give me.*Zoom assist - for when you use your 30x zoom but lose your subject*Size - for anyone that has gone hiking with a DSLR and multiple lenses, you know what a pain that can be.  This lighter camera is perfect for running around and still has a lot of the qualities that you'd look for in a DSLR.  So unless you're out taking professional shots, this comes in really handy*Discreet mode - This is a setting on the dial, great for those events when there is no flash allowed.  In this mode, the camera doesn't make noise when turning it on, nor does the flash go off.  Even if the camera goes off and you turn it back on, because it is set on the dial, it doesn't reset itself.  I've accidentally had my flash turned back on so many times that way on previous cameras.Cons -*Very poor manual - A lot of skipping around to get one thing done.  IE Looking through the start up manual, it says \"for instructions on attaching (the lens cap cord and neck strap) please see the user manual on the canon website\"  Granted, it wasn't difficult to figure out, but there was no clear spot for the lens cap cord, and it is something that should have been included in a \"start-up\" manual.  Another example of a poor manual, referring to the downloadable pdf manual...say you want to learn how to use the miniature setting...so it says \"miniature setting, pg 48\"  You go to pg 48 and it says to follow steps 1 and 2 on page 46....okay back to page 46, got that down, back to page 48.  It seems to be this way when trying to learn how to access any of the features.  I can't fault the actual camera for this, but definitely Canon.  I actually made up my own cheat sheet for accessing my favorite features until I have it down.*No ability to manually focus - Being that this camera is not a DSLR, I didn't expect or really even hope for this feature.  I would have liked it, but for the $$, I definitely can't complain and will upgrade in the future.*Mirrorless - I would definitely prefer to use a viewfinder, I am used to going without though, so it's easy to work around.*No Raw Shooting - this feature doesn't apply to most people, but sometimes I prefer to use it*No Touch Screen - This is taking time for me to get used to, I find myself constantly tapping the screen.  My last 2 cameras, going back to 2010, have been touch screen, so I'm surprised to find this camera doesn't have one.Some reviewers have complained about the difficulty of accessing the wifi, this was fairly easy for me and took about 15 minutes max.  It's a little more work than it typically takes to connect a device to wifi,and you have to use the computer to do it, but it's still not overly difficult.Despite the cons, I'm still incredibly impressed with this camera and it has definitely earned 5 stars when taking into account the type of camera, the construction, and the value.  I'm very happy with this purchase despite the fact that I was hoping for my next camera to be the Rebel.  I never imagined I'd get a camera of this level of quality for under $400.  (I paid $229, could have bought a slightly cheaper one, but wanted one that was Amazon fulfilled and prime)", "Date": "April 16, 2014"}, {"Title": "Great Camera", "Author": "jayan", "ReviewID": "RFMAT6B7TOLG1", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Great camera for  travellers,, fast  shooting ,, best thing i found is ,.. one can zoom while taking video.. which i have never found this feature in this  type version of cameras before", "Date": "October 23, 2013"}, {"Title": "Camera stops recording HD video randomly.", "Author": "Matthew H.

Wood \"Onetree\"", "ReviewID": "R24HY62WHUBAV9", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Had I not been leaving town for a trip the next day (October 18), I would have bought this through Amazon with the additional warranty, just to be safe.  The Amazon price is a great price.  This Power Shot is an upgrade from my first Cannon Powershot, the A590.  For me the selling features were, it's a Cannon and the extended telephoto 30X Optical Lens.  I've had great success with Cannon cameras, with many of the pictures I've shot with the A590 being used for magnetic photo bookmarks I sell.  The primary limitation with the A590 was the optical telephoto only being 4X with digital abilities to shoot out to 8X.  Shooting many outdoor shots, particularly of hummingbirds as an example, I could never get the quality shots I wanted.  With the SX510 I can stand off, zoom in and now have great shots.  It has all the features of the earlier A590, plus the longer telephoto, better battery life with it's Lithium Ion battery and some great new features I'm still learning.  One limitation is the lack of a viewfinder.  The digital screen is great, but a bit cumbersome to use when I zoom out to catch something in the distance.  That takes a bit to get used to and I'm still working on it.  As long as my subject doesn't move, fly off or disappear I can find it and shoot.  The other drawback is it's limited number of F stops.  I prefer the full range of F stops on my old SLR camera.  The SX510 gives you F3.4 - F8.  Although limited I have found it adequate for present.  The kit that it comes with gives you everything you need to get started.  It did take me a couple of weeks to realize that the little snap strap on the camera case is meant to snap around the camera neck harness.  That's a nice feature - I pull out the camera and don't have to fumble around trying to put the case down - I just let it hang from the neck strap and start shooting.  All in all, this is a great little camera for the price and it's a step in the right direction from earlier PowerShot cameras.  I would buy it again with no qualms.  This will do what I need, while I research Digital SLR's to replace my old film SLR.", "Date": "November 4, 2013"}, {"Title": "Love this camera", "Author": "Sarah Inghram", "ReviewID": "R1RIBWEB08Q12J", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I own 12 cameras.

Wither AE lock?", "Author": "Book Nut", "ReviewID": "R2RZ2YATLJUJ2F", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I'm shopping for a camera in this class, and settled on either the Nikon L830, Canon 510HS, Fujifilm S8200, or Sony DSCH300. I'm a Canon-kind-of-guy, and was happy to decide to get the Canon after a comparison. The Canon has some drawbacks, but it scored enough for me to go with it\u2014until I realized what a dumb design it truly is (fortunately I read the manual first). I.e., I probably will not spend my money on it. And I am really miffed about it, because I really wanted the Canon. So I'll share with you, FYI. There is a deal breaker with me when it comes to cameras, and it is the absence of Auto Exposure Lock (AE Lock). My itty-bitty compact 2007 Canon Digital ELPH, has it. And so do many if not most Canon cameras. It allows you to quickly get a good exposure in auto  mode, in one area of the ground/sky/wherever, and apply that exposure to the scene you want to shoot elsewhere but are struggling to get a balanced exposure on (e.g., think bright sky and dark ground in a landscape shot). I use it all the time outside, and it makes for well exposed pics really quickly without fussing. With the 510HS, for some reason, the AE Lock cancels after taking 1 pic! What?! Why would they do that? It's ridiculous. But OK, for one photo at a time I can live with it begrudgingly. But then I discovered another deal breaker I didn't realize I had in me...the camera doesn't have a panorama feature (all it's competitors do!) and it also doesn't have a Stitch-assist  function, which once again, even my low-end compact from 2007 has! It's like discovering your $100,000 car doesn't come with mirrors. So to take a panorama when you are traveling, you have to manually compose the pics without the help of an assist, and then compile it with software later. OK, once again I could deal with that very begrudgingly...except now have to keep the exposure constant somehow between all your pics! How could you do this? Well, with AE Lock. Oh. Wait. It cancels after one shot! Son of a...! Do they not want you to take panoramas?! So yes, Canon, I could work around it by fidgeting with Manual exposure for 5 minutes until I get the perfect aperture and shutter values and then take multiple images and then use software to merge the scene...but you know what, I don't have to go through that 5 minutes of hell, because I can use my 2007 compact elph to take the shot in 5 seconds, or just buy any one of your competitors' cameras with a panorama feature that'll lock the exposure. Oh well, I now realized that I secretly did want the Nikon's twice-as-fast shooting lens for safari shots anyway.

Must be very careful of camera shake if not using the flash.", "Author": "Clyde R. Henderson", "ReviewID": "R21Z99IIM5UILT", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I purchased this camera from a local store while visiting in Arizona in January 2014. The trip was supposed to be very short, only a few days, and I was 'traveling light'. The only camera i had with me was my iPhone 5s.As the trip time stretched out to over a month I decided I wanted another camera to take 'better' (i.e. zoomed in) pictures but I didn't want to break the bank for a temporary camera.  Thus the choice of the 510 HS.  The local store agreed to match the Amazon price otherwise I would have ordered it from Amazon as I'm a Prime member.I didn't expect a whole lot from this camera (I own a Canon 5D Mk III and a Canon 7D) but I was surprised in how well it does work if held in a stable manner.  Except for a little bit of softness (described below) one can get very good images using manual mode. I even managed to get a very good image of the moon using 30x magnification--hand held no less--and manual mode.The system is not really sensitive so one has to be careful if not using the flash.  Watch out for the orange symbol indicating camera shake as that indicates the exposure time is below 1/20th of a second.  Anything below about 1/125 is going to give considerable blurring when handheld in a caviler manner.  I suggest using the flash, if possible, whenever the exposure time grows larger than 1/60.Even when taking flash pictures, the images are a bit soft but they usually become 'good enough' if given a little sharpening.  I'm not sure if this softness is native to the 510 HS or if it's my particular unit.  I'm used to the incredibly sharp images I get from my 5D Mk III or 7D so it may just be the softness one can expect from an inexpensive camera with a huge zoom range.  In other words, I'm being too critical of an inexpensive camera with respect to softness of the image.To sum thing up, I'm not sorry I purchased the camera.  It will be used quite a bit for quick snapshots--my wife already prefers the 510 HS to her S95.", "Date": "March 15, 2014"}, {"Title": "Small form, big results", "Author": "Jim Elmer", "ReviewID": "R3O9ELVIZ5JACD", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I needed a small camera able to zoom long distances that could also take shots in low light.

I took it on vacation to Jamaica with my girlfriend and they really captured the experience. The video is impressive and the stabilization is really useful when you're filming while walking or driving. I love this little camera.HoweverI purchased it on March 24th 2014, and today, May 18th 2014 it has stopped functioning properly. Less than 2 months. I am outside of the 30 day exchange period, so I will have to pay shipping to get it replaced or fixed. The button that snaps the photo, as well as the zoom slider have both become difficult to use. When I zoom it sticks, and continues to go either out or completely in until it can't any further. The button also intermittently works when I snap a photo, I have to press relatively hard and that leads to a blurry photo. I probably got the lemon of the batch, but in order to review it properly based on my experience I will warrant it only 3 stars.EDIT: I ended up talking to customer service at Amazon, and no questions asked they sent me a return label. Since it will be so easy to exchange, I will bump it up to 4 stars!", "Date": "May 18, 2014"}, {"Title": "I love this camera!", "Author": "Brigid", "ReviewID": "RHZT7LA8IXBDJ", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This camera is a perfect blend of a digital camera and a professional.Pros- Many different effects to help you take the perfect picture. Once you learn how to use each of them, it's very easy to choose the right effect to help you take a good photo that won't require much editing. I personally love the Vibrant feature, Portrait (blurs the background), and Hi-Speed Burst.- The zoom is incredible, at 30x. I have taken fantastic photos that would have been pixelated from the zoom with other cameras.- 12.1 MP creates flawless photos, it gives the illusion that I have a professional camera and actually know what I'm doing! Haha.- The camera strap is great. I often take pictures at the zoo, and instead of fishing my camera out of my bag, I can just put the strap over my shoulder or go full-tourist by putting it around my neck.- The camera is a nice size that allows you to comfortably grip the camera.- A rechargeable battery is great, I prefer it to carrying around a pack of AAs like I did in the good ol' days. The battery has a long life, and doesn't take long to charge. If I were going on a trip where I didn't have access to electricity, I'd pack an extra battery.Cons- I wish there was a viewfinder! Sometimes it's hard to see the screen when you're in the sun--I had trouble in Hawaii.- WiFi isn't all that great. I prefer taking the SD card and putting pictures right onto my computer, it's a lot faster than waiting for them to upload via WiFi, then downloading them from the site, then editing, etc. If you don't edit your photos, then you would like this feature, I personally don't.- Be careful, it's very easy to delete all of your pictures! I bought this camera right before I went on vacation to Hawaii. After I had taken over 300 photos, I was trying to look at a set of pictures I took with the Hi-Speed Burst function, and accidentally deleted ALL of my photos. I freaked out for a minute, then googled to see what I could do, and it turns out that if you don't take any pictures, you can find software online that will recover every photo you have ever taken on that SD card. It took an entire evening to recover all of my photos, and I'm always very careful when reviewing pictures on the camera so that I don't have to experience that headache again.- Manual focus would've been nice. As this camera is not a DSLR, I can't really blame Canon for not allowing some manual focus... But at times when I'm trying to get the camera to focus where I want it, I have to lightly press the capture button several times until I get what I want. Not unbearable, but in the future it'd be nice.All in all, this is a great camera. I've been using Canon for years, and this is by far the best camera I've ever owned from them. If you want a camera that feels like the lovechild of a DSLR and a Digital Camera, then this is the camera for you.", "Date": "May 14, 2014"}, {"Title": "Interesting little Canon camera", "Author": "Stormy1", "ReviewID": "R1L6VOF7OOCOET", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I just received my Canon SX-510 HS digital camera to replace an older Olympus digital camera since I needed a replacement pronto. First thing I noticed when I opened up the box & took out the camera and my first thought was.....\"holy cow...it's so small!\" It looks like my Canon SX-50 HS camera, but smaller with a few features missing.I took a small variety of photos yesterday with this camera and overall, not bad.Photo quality outdoors seems good and also in low light situations, this camera seems to take decent photos without flash. Indoor photo quality seems good with flash. Video quality is fine also and in HD.Overall, this small camera seems easy to use and very similar in ease of use compared to my bigger Canon SX-50 HS camera.Pros include:  easy to use, good menu system, 30X optical zoom, large rear LCD viewfinder, nice quality-looking camera, comfy hand grip....tho a bit smallish, great high speed photo shoot option and finally acceptable photo quality inside and outside.Cons include: a fixed rear LCD viewfinder [not really a big deal], zoom operates a little slow and rather smallish camera. I am not really a big person, but this camera seems tiny.....like a compact point & shoot with a huge zoom on it.To me, this camera seems built for a smaller adult, teen or younger since it's really smaller than I thought. If Canon made the grip just a bit larger, that would have solved the problem....at least they added a rubberized outer coating on the grip and that's a very nice touch.It's a nice little camera that takes decent photos. I intend to keep this camera and overall, I gave this camera 4 of 5 stars mostly due to the fact this camera is a bit smaller than I expected and a bit sluggish with the zoom operation.

Maybe it is just me but I am blown away! I think the average person will find this camera to be fantastic. Photography nuts will undoubtedly find issues with controls and sensors and things, but for the rest of us that just want to take a good picture, it fits the bill.Size: This thing is a little smaller than I was expecting, and that is great. It is easy to take pictures with one hand if need be, but is also comfortable to hold in two hands.Pictures: To my eye, the pictures out of this thing are great, and much improved over our older cameras and current cell phones. For now I have just been using the Auto settings and letting the camera decide what internal things to change, and it is great. I am a notoriously bad photographer (at least according to my wife) and even she things I take good pictures with this camera.Usability: I haven't played with the picture taking settings yet (ISO, aperture, etc). But I have played with some of the pre-set configurations and they work as advertised. It is easy to adjust so I think I will sit down one day and really get a feel for what I can change. Taking movies on this thing is ridiculously easy. Push the little red button by your right thumb and you are in movie mode. Sound comes in pretty well and the movies look great on our TV. The optical zoom is excellent and the \"finder\" feature when zoomed way in is indispensable.WiFi: So setting up the wifi was amazingly easy for me. The instruction book jumps around a bit but if you follow the instructions, it takes less than 5 minutes. I have successfully connected the camera to my home Wifi and computer, as well as my tablet and phone. I love that I can connect it to my phone/tablet even without an available wifi (the camera itself becomes the hotspot). This is perfect for downloading vacation pictures in the evening.Overall, I am very pleased with this purchase. For the price, I feel that I am getting a great camera with a ton of features. For those that want more than a traditional point and shoot rectangle camera, but don't want to drop a grand on a DSLR setup, this camera is perfect. Even my photog friends are impressed with the capabilities of this little guy.", "Date": "April 9, 2014"}, {"Title": "Great Photos, extremely flakey wifi...", "Author": "Chuck", "ReviewID": "R1TQOYEL30ZDYN", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "So the Camera itself has been great so far. I have take some great photos with it and it has taken some great movies too. The zoom is pretty good although indoors it does have a bit of a tough time gaining focus when zoomed too far in. I like the added adjustments it has.The two complaints have have are one, the microphone is a bit weak, in that it doeasn't pick up voices all that well and when taking video outside, even with the wind filter on, it really picks up wind noise. Plus, it also picks up the zoom motor when zooming during a movie.The other issue is the wifi. I have two main issues...1) It doesn't recognize wireless access points properly. I have 2 routers, one at each end of the house, because one router will not cover the full house. I have one set up as the main router and the other as an access point. With just about all other devices, I only see one wireless network in my house for the \"G\" network(as I should) and devices will just use the access point, to that network, with the strongest signal when connecting. HOWEVER, with the camera, I see two completely separate networks, both named with the identical name. So when I goto connect, it will always try to use the access point it used prior. If it is out of range, it fails and I have to redo the setup, choosing the other network of the same name and connect. Since this thing doesn't have great wireless range, I also sometimes get the \"Invalid Password\" error, if I am too far from the access point it is trying to use. This REALLY gets annoying after a while having to change the \"network\" I am using depending on where I am in the house.2. As mentioned in 1, when it has a weak signal, it is quick to suddenly not recognize my wifi password, giving my a \"Password is Invalid\" message. Moving right next to the router will sometimes correct it but it will still fail sometimes. Even choosing the \"other\" network(aka access point) it still won't recognize the password. Once it gets the password error, it seems like it gets stuck in the mode somethimes and the only way to get it to connect it do a WPS connection with the routers. Once I do that, it will be fine until the next time I try to connect and I am too far from the access point it is set to use and I get the error again.The wifi issues are enough to really sour me on a good camera. One of the reasons I liked this camera was because of the wifi. I love not having to mess around with cables and such getting my photos/movies to the PC.I gave it 4 stars but it probably should be 3.5, as the pictures are great so far(which is what a camera is for) but if it supposed to have wifi as a main feature then it should be implemented right and it's not.Pros...Great photos so farGreat movies so farMany setting to choose from, even includes a manual focus modeCons...Poor microphone for moviesZoom motor noise during movies.WIFI issues!!!!!", "Date": "February 17, 2014"}, {"Title": "Nice camera.", "Author": "Carl A Smith", "ReviewID": "R3K598A7MOYADW", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Nice camera takes excellent pictures.

It won't quite fit in a pants pocket, but if you have cargo pants you may be able to fit it into one of the cargo pockets.  But it comes with a neck/shoulder strap so you can wear it that way as well,A few other reviewers have commented on the camera saying they could not take a clear picture.  I would say it is user error because I have not experienced any blurred pictures.  The auto focus takes some getting used to for people who have never used auto focus.  The shutter is not instantaneous.  You have to hold the camera still until after the shot is complete.  You can't simply press the shutter and take the pictures,  You have to wait until the shot is done before moving the camera.The camera has LOADS of options for shooting, similar to  a DSLR.  But the Auto feature yields good results as well.I am very pleased with this camera.  I would buy it again.  The video is very good and the still images  are also as good.  I would recommend this camera for anyone who wants more control over their video and camera abilities. You'll enjoy this camera if you are looking for a smaller camera.  I bought it because I didn't want to take my expensive DSLR on a family trip.  This camera is a cross between point-and-shoot and a DSLR.", "Date": "April 2, 2014"}, {"Title": "love this camera", "Author": "Judy R.", "ReviewID": "R1AQQ5REQ8OWFD", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I have not had this camera very long yet and I am still \"playing\" with it.

They have dropped a huge notch in my book unless they make good on these items.", "Date": "December 27, 2013"}, {"Title": "It's an okay indoor camera for the person that has never taken a picture.", "Author": "William J. Sagaberd", "ReviewID": "RS0ZRZBJ8JGBN", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "If you like to take pictures outside this is NOT the model of camera to choose.  Without a view finder this camera is pretty much useless outdoors since the screen becomes completely obscured by moderate outside light.  If it's a clear sunny day you are not even able to tell if the camera is turned on or not unless you use BOTH hands to surround the screen to block all reflections.  Why is this relevant?  If you have to use BOTH hands in order to see the screen how do you depress the shutter button?  If you cannot see the screen in bright light how do compose your scene or see if it's in focus?The MACRO function is rather odd.  When you switch the camera to Macro shooting mode you are forced to high speed burst mode that only allows pictures up to 3 mega pixel. (That's a 75% reduction in picture quality.)  I've been through every single page of the new updated manual but have not found any way to disable the high speed burst mode when shooting in any mode except 100% automatic.  The firmware will not allow low-light pictures to be taken.  If the firmware decides the there is not enough light it will not allow a picture to be taken until the flash has been physically raised.Anther outdoor downfall of this camera is the proprietary Lithium Ion battery that can only be charged use 120v AC current. So if you are off the grid camping, hiking, or traveling away from North America plan on buying several extra batteries and budget your camera usage carefully.Very Important Safety Note:  The obnoxious bright green auto-focus assist beam cannot be turned off.  Which means you cannot use the camera at any indoor sporting events that prohibit flash photography.  I was ejected from three events. I finally realized it was the BRIGHT green auto-focus assist lamp that was drawing complaints from participants. Could not find an option to disable the beam, so I covered it up with a piece of dark colored tape.  When the beam is covered or blocked the camera will not even power on.  IF the beam is covered after power up it displays \"HARDWARE FOCUS ERROR - Service required\" then powers off.  You have to remove the battery, and also the small button cell battery that maintains the settings (CMOS) and clock before the camera will turn on again.  This also explains there the extreme red-eye effect in every picture of people whether or not the flash was used, this includes animals also.  Pretty bad when you are getting red-eye effect in pictures of birds outdoors.  This also explains why road signs, reflective clothing, and reflective signage all appear as directly illuminated even in bright sunlight.  It seems the beam is illuminated just before, during, and briefly after the exposure of the picture.  Why?This is not a photographer friendly camera, it's seems to be entirely designed for people that have never taken a picture before and do not understand what is causing the conditions I'm describing.  The optics of this Canon camera are exceptional, but the operating system of the camera renders them pretty much useless.", "Date": "June 4, 2014"}, {"Title": "Easy to Use and Takes Great Pictures!", "Author": "PB&Jam", "ReviewID": "R38BSWW439UN6P", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I am no photographer but I wanted a camera that took really nice pictures without me having to learn a special skill set.

And as prices came down, we'd get a little better camera - usually Canons. Last year, we decided we wanted, and could afford the next step up - a Nikon J1. Long story short - nice pix, short battery life, too much stuff to drag around.This year we decided that we wanted to see if there was something available at a reasonable price, that could take almost as good pictures as the Nikon, but was handier to take on vacation (no lens switching). I AM SO HAPPY I FOUND THIS ONE!! (Sorry, I hate all caps, but that's really how I feel.)The pictures are incredible. I only used flash as a 'just in case' backup picture, but the non-flash pictures are all better. I've never seen such nice lowlight resolution in a moderately priced camera.The zoom is INCREDIBLE. I hope to post a couple pix that show its range. And though I tried hard to be still for long range shots, I don't have the steadiest of hands, but the anti-shake in this camera is ... yes, incredible.The battery life is all that I needed. I took about 100 shots a day and used the zoom a LOT, and only had to change the battery every day and a half. (I bought a spare for that very purpose.)I love the flash popup - so simple, yet so effective.Here are my little nitpicky cons: The zoom feels a bit rough at high speed.

I got a harness for the SLR but with this little Canon Gem I don't need it because it isn't any heavier than a point and shoot but so much more capable.I think I agree with the reviewer that said the aftermarket batteries last longer than the Canon batteries that came with the camera.

After doing research online, this camera was 'best fit' for his needs.  With the assistance of Amazon's 'you might be interested' feature I ordered software, SIM card, and carrying case.  I do not recall reading ANYWHERE in the features/benefit or specification page that a CANON-SPECIFIC USB cable did not accompany the camera, or I would have automatically ordered the cable.My husband has just spent over two (2) hours with the camera, computer, and different USB cables attempting to download the software onto his computer.  The message indicates 'no device detected';  needless to say he's frustrated.  I came back to the Amazon site and looked up the camera and saw a USB Cable for this camera; usually under $20, on sale for $5.75.  Not a problem except we live in Hawaii (not eligible for PRIME) and the shipping will cost more than the RETAIL price of the cable; not to mention shipping time.Bottom line:  camera is ready to go, software is ready to go, without a CANON-specific USB cable, nothing's going to happen.  It's like buying a car, only to discover that before you drive it away, you'll need to buy the car keys.I strongly urge Canon to include the cable with the camera, whether you choose to charge extra is a no-brainer to reduce customer frustration (read customer reviews under Canon SX510 USB Cable).  From a marketing perspective, it's little things like this that could be prevented if you looked at the impact of total customer experience.Will submit an additional review ONCE THE CAMERA is up and running with downloaded software in the computer.  In the meantime, we'll just set all the parts/pieces aside and wait for a week or more until the USB cable arrives; then we'll repeat the installation/set up process.

First of all, the camera shell is plastic and seemed cheaply made.  I felt that an occasional bump might break the camera easily.  Secondly, the lens cap was separate and manually operated.  On my old sx170 the camera autoclosed the lens cap when you turn off the camera.  Thirdly,  the flash does not pop up automatically.  This is a pain for me.  I don't like the shape of the camera either, the lens is so big and sticks out so far that it could not easily fit in a pocket.  I ordered the Canon sx260 to replace this one.

Terrific results!!  It has a 20x optical lens, and for several long range shots I used the digital magnification out to 50x without running into grainy photos.  It uses AA batteries which proved essential when the batteries needed to be changed \"out in the bush.\"Was thinking I'd upgrade to this one, but reading up on the specs leads me to conclude that Canon has taken two big backward steps:  this one has no viewfinder which is critical to finding and photographing the lion at 800 yards!  And going to a rechargeable battery vs AA batteries was the wrong thing to do with this type of camera.  Yes, you could buy a spare rechargeable battery, but I had total confidence in carrying two sets of fresh AA batteries into the bush.  I'll stick with my SX20.", "Date": "March 24, 2014"}, {"Title": "Didn't receive 16GB memory card or case as stated", "Author": "David Gallant", "ReviewID": "R1TDS38A7ZTE8K", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "I'm giving the rating 3 stars for now as I haven't really used the camera because when it was opened on Christmas morning there was no 16GB memory card or carrying case as stated would ship with when I made the order.

There was a limited time promotion on the camera when I ordered the camera. The bag and the memory card were advertised as part of the purchase price but they were not in the package when I received the camera.When I called the Amazon customer care, they said that they were not aware of promotion as it is no longer available and will have to forward it to their promotion department. The promotion department responded to the query by putting a link to another promotion which said that the bag and card should have been ordered with the camera. SERIOULY AMAZON !!! If you do not mention the brand of the case and card in the promotion how the heck will the customer know what to add. Do you expect us to guess? Also, if there was a promotion and you expected the customer to add the it to the order should you NOT have prompted me to add it if it was missing. Were you expecting to get away with providing the card and case if the customer forgets to add?The next time I called Amazon customer care to challenge the response and the customer care rep responded by apologizing for not having sent the case and card (That's why one star else it would have been no STAR!). But she was not able to send them to me now as the offer had expired and hence cannot be added to the cart to be shipped.The expectation was that AMAZON should have sent the case and card with the package as advertised and not rely on the customer to guess something and add it to order hoping that it will be waived at the time of order confirmation.
