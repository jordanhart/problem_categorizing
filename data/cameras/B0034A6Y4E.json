I started some checking myself & found the 12V power supply for the cameras was defective. I called back & got a recording so left a message saying I needed a  replacement power supply.  I can't remember how many times I called & either got no answer at all or an answering machine. E mails didn't work either.(The smartest thing I had done was to go through AMAZON to buy this thing!)After a week of getting nowhere I contacted Amazon. They offered me the option of returning it for a credit & even furnished a UPS shipping label for that purpose.I have to assume they contacted the seller for me because I heard from them right away & even got answers to E-mail. I was told a power supply would be shipped out right away & a tracking number would be E-mailed to me. That was the last I ever heard from them. I tried more E's & phone calls & even waited a week or more to see if something might arrive. I finally re-packed the whole thing & sent it back to Amazon.

It was a bit difficult but manageable with some networking knowledge. Its working well with DSL & its slow by dialup. The picture on my LCD TV does not show the room true colors. I don't know why yet. Cameras are NOT made by Sharp or Sony but they said they are made from sharp or Sony parts. They look high quality cams.

I was forced to improvise the weather proofing of the connections by using srink tubing and a heat gun.

Prior to this we had a single b&w; infrared camera hooked up to an old TV and it was just awful, and that camera itself cost close to fifty dollars. If bought separately, I'm sure just the major components (DVR + cameras) would add up to more than what it costs. Bundling them all together with nice long cables, custom security monitoring software and a remote control makes this a lot of system for the money.Picture quality: colors are not bright and vivid, but this is actually an advantage in challenging lighting, for instance if there is bright sunlight with deep shadows. Clarity is sufficient to keep an eye on everything, and up close images would be good enough to give law enforcement a recognizable image. At night, the infrared illumination isn't color, but it's not monotone, either -- makes it much easier to see.Software: there's certainly a learning curve and we've not yet tackled the networking aspects of it, but once you get the hang of it, switching between views and zooming is such a great feature vs. our old stand-alone camera. I like that the alarm goes off if anyone messes with any of the cameras, though that was a bit of a pain when we were setting it up and hadn't figured out how to switch that off.Hardware quality: these are good solid cameras, with good sturdy mounting brackets, and the DVR with 500GB is more than adequate storage, even if you record on high quality it holds close to a week of recordings. Make sure to clear off space before it gets low, otherwise you risk having alarms go off in the middle of the night. The connections in the back were a little iffy at first, but after we got everything set up we tied down the cables and no problems since then (if you experience this you will really want to make sure you put the unit and cables where it doesn't get bumped, as that alarm will go off if the connection is disturbed).My only wish would be that it had built-in audio as well, but it's set up so that can be added at a later date if we wish.All in all I am very satisfied with the purchase and very comforted by the ability to keep an eye on our questionable neighbors and have evidence should anything happen.", "Date": "May 4, 2011"}, {"Title": "HAHA", "Author": "James TC-AZ", "ReviewID": "R1KNSLM2JD79O8", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I'm laughing because when I was looking for a system I played Russian roulette. And I got one great system. I'm a first time buyer in the field of cameras. I also picked this because it came with 500 gb HDD, day and night cams, that works amazingly well, and that I can view on my phone. I hooked it up and BAM!!! It was perfect. I'm still trying to figure out the network thing to view on my phone. All I've done was plug in a network cable and downloaded the EagleEyes light app for iPhone and it worked over my WiFi but not on 3G so I gotta fix that. Haha. I'm stoked cause this had mixed reviews. But I'm soo happy because this is the most expensive purchase I made on amazon. And it was packaged well.Now for my problems with it. When I opened the box it looked secure and packed well. The HDD dvr fealt flimsy and had a dent in the top. It looked like a pre packed issue not UPS fault. And when I would shake it something would rattle. I said well if it works I'll keep it. And it worked!!! Other problem was one cam mount was broken. But I fixe it. I ran all my wires and it all was great. I'm giving 5 stars cause it's a great buy. But it might change depending on the life of the cam and dvr.UPDATE!!! 11-18-11hi guys and ladies. It is now November 2011. Roughly 4 months since I purchased this unit. I bought some added stuff to go with this. They are a 20 inch Asus monitor, 25ft VGA monitor cable, and a monitor wall mount. These items compliment the system very well and it makes it look cleaner in my home. Now I suppose you are wondering how the last four months have treated me. Well I'm pleased to say that everything is still 100%. I've had this unit running 24/7 and I've had no issues. Out of the four cams I have 2 of them outside and they are still 100%. I would recommended using srink tube for all cam connections indoors and outdoors for added safety. But as of today I have had no issues what so ever. I'm pleased.UPDATE!!! 11-5-12Hey y'all. Its been well over 1 year since i brought this camera system into my home. Coming up on 1 year since my last update I am glad to inform you that my experience with this has been great. First off i will let you all know that i do live in Tucson AZ and i have 3 cameras out side exposed to the elements. They have been in the same spot since i first installed them. They have handled the heat, cold, rain and recently a few small rocks thrown at one of them by some punks. lol they are tough cams and the picture is still great since day one. I want to mention that the wires supplied and even purchased do not look to be rated for out doors. I recently placed my wires in the wall of my home for a cleaner look and to keep them out of the weather. As for the one indoor cam its perfect no one touches it and it just does its own thing. Through the last year i have done some extreme remodeling in my home and i have had a chance to run all my wires to a central location in my home. The wires have been beaten up and smashed with in the walls of my AZ home. Im not done with my remodel but after testing all cameras before i closed up my walls the wires and cams still work good. Now last but not least these cameras are night vision equipped so they have a ring of red infer red lights that turn on when there is no light. there are roughly 20-60 of these in cameras and quite visible. Recently i noticed one of my cameras has one light go out. This is not a issue being that there are many more to cover it. This is normal with any camera so be prepared. There are two things you can do. 1 is to purchase a new cam here on amazon for roughly 50 bucks or buy a Infer Red spot light. With the spot light you will double or even triple your night vision range. The spot light is invisible to people and will not cause any harm to your cameras. I will be installing a few of theres IR flood lights shortly as a added measure incase my IR lights go out on my cameras. Well i think this will be my last update on this product. I think these cameras are a great buy and well worth the time and effort to install. Having that added security and making me and my family feel safer is all i could of asked for.UPDATE!!!! 08-16-2013I LIED HERES ANOTHER UPDATE!!!!!! WOW how long have i had this thing? Like 2 or so years now!!!! BUY THIS No questions at all!! I most definitely thought i would have had to replace a camera by now but nope!! Works great! Still does everything it should do! Been running non stop 24/7 no problems, it handles power outages well with no problems. I really don't know what else to say on this. I was not sure at first but now its a no brainer. I have recommended this system to all my neighbors and many have purchased it. the cams hold well in the tough AZ heat 110 degrees and higher!!!

Make sure 4 channels is enough, I though 4 channels was plenty when I purchased but somewhat wished for an 8 channel after I was done, but I would certainly buy again.The DVR is a brand name AVTECH (mine was a KPD674). This DVR can record 704x480 at 30 TOTAL IPS (across 4 channels this gives capability of 7.5 frames per second on each channel). This provides quite good RECORDED video with acceptable frame rates for most purposes. Motion recording, alarming, and lan log-in work well. Also has prerecord capability (DVR will record for several seconds before motion is detected to ensure that no action is missed). Automatic email sending reportedly DOES NOT WORK if you also use time based motion detection, so beware. LAN access appears to become unreliable after a few days of heavy use, and requires DVR reboot. No issues with recording have been encountered, even when the LAN is being cranky. DVR has audio recording capability but system comes with no mics; but check your local laws on recording audio before you try it! Dont update firmware unless you want a significant risk of bricking your DVR. No display of space remaining on hard drive with remote login.Cameras have quite good day capability, but dont expect it to look like a multi-megapixel movie camera (as good or better than bank camera footage on TV). Nite function of cameras is good to about 20-30 feet, but dont expect to recognize faces from that distance. Numerous bugs are attracted to the infrared illuminators, so keep this in mind for nite usage outside. The illuminators glow dully red at nite, so they are not wholly covert. Possibly next time I will use cameras without illuminators built in, and use separate illuminators to reduce bugs tripping motion at nite.Included 65 foot camera leads are fairly good, but I did need one 100 foot cable.

Another great feature for me and my needs is the motion detection, with this set up, when I review the days motion alerts (sequenced by time and camera triggered) I can review the days motion and see exactly when someone or something moved in the cameras viewing area (this feature may not be as beneficial in high traffic or windy areas) making it so easy to review without spending  a great deal of time fast forwarding through hours of footage.Concerning the remote viewing, it took me several hours of research and trial and error until I finally was able to get remote access.  It may take you more or less time depending on your knowledge of port forwarding, your internet provider's modem and service, and your router and it's configuration. Well worth the time, because now I can view my cameras on my Iphone and can view and modify settings on my laptop from anywhere in the world (with internet connection).Since it was set up, everything on this system has worked well, except one camera which seems to have a hardware issue of which I just e-mailed the seller to see if they know what is the issue.

So knowing this, this is our experience setting these cameras up for local network access and accessing from the world wide internet.  My husband did the setup of cameras attached to dvr (which was not difficult) and then my job was to get our cameras so we could see them on the internet. Well, not knowing the difference between local network IP address and internet provider IP(which at the time I had no clue I had a local network -I will call it behind the firewall, which doesn't reach the world wide web and accessing the cameras from the world wide web.)I spent five days, long hours, reading forums and watching youtube, which all helped, but still I had trouble getting this all working.  Finally I could see my cameras on my local network and they worked GREAT.  I learned about setting the local IP address for the dvr, port forwarding through my Linksys Router, but still I couldn't see my cameras on the server IP (which is now you access when you travel away from your local network.  Well, it took a KID who plays games online to explain about doing a bridge.  You see my internet provider modem is not only a modem, but a ROUTER also, which has a firewall.

You have username and password to keep private. We actually got the cameras for fun, watching around the outside of the house and because they were affordable.

Baca", "ReviewID": "RMTG45X6NGO1Z", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "This whole system is super complex to install. I couldn't figure it out with the provided directions and had to research other systems on youtube at which point it worked whenever I did a magic handclap and sang it a song....in other words it is constistently unconsitent in its ability to talk to your smartphone. You need to know advanced network and port abilities to install this thing. The instructions are in chinese english and are completely impossible to understand. Broken up garb, wrong tense, wrong words, wrong structure.After spending half a day running cables through walls and sucking insulation etc. I find out that the cables provided with the DVR don't work on night vision cameras. Turn off the lights and the camera goes blank or disconnects. As soon as this happens you suddenly can't access your DVR using your phone or remote internet connection until you reboot the entire system and turn the lights back on so the cameras can \"See\". I did buy a 3rd party cable by Videosecu that DOES work for the cameras provided during pitch black night. So in short, yes the cameras are night vision, but no, the cables are not. If I had to buy another system I would look into Videosecu right off the bat as they have a much more informative description about their product and TELL YOU that you must be ADVANCED in CCDTV to install their product.And one more note: cameras cannot see through glass at night. If you do this, they reflect back and basically film themselves. You have to install them OUTDOORS. You can't expect to install them in your room, looking out your window.And like others, the system I got was not at all like the one in the picture.Update: I contacted the seller, KC USA and explained that I had lost a day of install and had ordered my own chords to replace the ones that were bad. I asked them to reimburse me with a free camera and power chord, which they agreed to do once it was \"in stock\". After about 4 emails and finally a threat to report them to Amazon they did in fact hold true to their word and sent me another camera.In hindsite, the 1st thing you should do is1) make sure it works in the dark before you run cables2) study up on router basics with CCTV. Your internet service provider basically sees certain ports on your router as \"highly exposed to hacking\". Which means you can get your system to be viewable through the internet but then it suddenly stops working once your internet service provider figures out that you are viewing your DVR through a common port. Visit \"[...]\" for more info on how to bypass this. And then sign up for an IP fix at NO-IP.com in the case that you have a dynamic IP address (which will also screw your ability to view your DVR online).3) realize the night time range of my cameras is about 15'. After that everything is a blurred pixel. In the day time, the range is about 30' to see details on peoples faces. After that, things are a blur of pixel movement even in good light.", "Date": "October 29, 2011"}, {"Title": "Security Surveillance DVR w/ Four CCD bullet Cameras KIT", "Author": "entity247", "ReviewID": "R2273TTZNJNE36", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "Nice system, but the online and smart phone feathers are hard to setup and needs lots of extra software to work.

I used the system for my annual Halloween haunt, which picked up all the action in the key locations.  A very cool option is recording as soon as you turn on the system, which is an automatic option in the system menu.  The reason it was important, I didn't recall the secure code to unlock the menu until I returned to my office the next day for the manual.  Once I used the code, I realized that I didn't miss the action the night before.

I have the pc viewing from inside my home network and due to the recording features I haven't felt it necessary to view from off-site. I just come home and do a fast paced scan. This system is almost self explanatory if you read and pay attention to the menu descriptions. I'm a tech so maybe that makes an end user difference. Only 2 reasons I dropped a star was for the fact that I would have preferred software to load on my computer rather than having to change all my IE setting to get the viewer to install; however after that and putting default settings back (not good if you have custom settings) viewer worked like a charm. 2nd is the viewing angle of the cameras, I would have liked to see a little wider viewing angle to cover the yard.
