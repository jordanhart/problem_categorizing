Since it hasn't been upgraded in quite some time, I thought it was the end of the line for the series. When the G15 was announced, I immediately wanted one. Having had it for a couple of days now, I'm very happy with it. Out of the box, the biggest difference I noticed was that the G15 no longer has an articulated swivel screen. To a lot of people, this will be a huge disappointment. There is a positive to this though. Without it, the camera is thinner and lighter now. The screen is also larger and higher resolution. (3\", 920K). The lens has the same focal length as the G12, but the new G15 lens has a wider aperture. f1.8 vs f2.8. My results show a nice improvement in low light situations. Canon has also improved the auto-focus speed. Megapixels have been increased from 10mp to 12mp. The G15 has a 1/1.7\" CMOS sensor, which is larger than most compact style cameras. The DSLR style controls and menus are easy to navigate and understand. On my initial battery charge, I managed just over 300 shots, which I consider good. Now for the most important thing. Image quality. I took several hundred pictures in various conditions. Image quality was excellent under all circumstances. I shot in JPEG mode, using ISO 80-800. Images shot outdoors in good lighting conditions were almost DSLR quality. Images shot indoors were excellent too. Image noise up to ISO 400 was barely noticeable. At ISO 800, noise become more noticeable, but results were still much better than you'd expect from a compact camera. I only shot a minimal amount of video since I have little interest in using it, but what I did shoot does look good. The G15 can do 1080P at 24fps. All in all, the Canon G15 is just a great camera.Pros:Excellent image quality.Fast 5x 28-140mm lens.RAW image capture.DSLR style manual controls.Good battery life.Fairly thin and lightweight.3\", 920K screen.Optical viewfinder.Cons:No articulated screen.Ergonomics might be awkward to some.", "Date": "October 2, 2012"}, {"Title": "An excellent camera", "Author": "S. Vogt", "ReviewID": "R165F1031Z4X2I", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Updated 9/25/13The first thing I noticed when I took the G15 out of its box for the first time was its impressive build quality. Everything is tightly constructed and what feels like a tough mag alloy body. It's not necessarily pocketable but is slightly smaller and thinner than the G12. One minor complaint, however, is that the handgrip up front seems shallower than on the G12 so at first it doesn't feel as comfortable to grip. The battery is of a good size and the camera gets excellent battery life.The control layout on the back of the camera is the same as the G12 and G1X, generally straight-forward and logically placed. The menu system has not changed at all from previous models... so if you're coming from the G12, you should be able to locate where everything is rather quickly. You have the function button for the most commonly accessed settings and the menu button for all other settings. The LCD on back, while sadly, not articulated like on the G12 is gorgeous...very bright and clear. The viewfinder is the same small one found in the G1X and G12..but it works okay when you can't use the LCD.Canon promised improved AF performance over the G12 and it is most certainly quicker. It isn't the fastest in its class but it does have reliable AF and no problems even in low light locking on. Most folks will find it perfectly satisfactory. Lens performance is quite snappy though, and you can zoom in and out relatively quickly. The camera also has some of the most rock solid image stabilization on any camera I have seen.The image quality that this camera produces is excellent considering its sensor size. You can of course wring out more detail out of your photos if you shoot RAW. But the JEPGS are excellent as well. Color performance is excellent. It produces punchy but accurate colors and the lens is decently sharp at all focal lengths. Noise is well controlled through ISO400 but you can still get decent results up through ISO1600, especially if you shoot RAW and don't blow the photos up to huge sizes. However, with the fast lens, you may never need to go that high. My one minor gripe with this camera is that it overexposes at times. You can correct that problem very quickly though by dialing in some negative exposure compensation. But overall, I think most people will find the photos that this camera produces very nice.I have not messed much with the movie mode but it has a few manual controls. One feature that stuck out to me is the 1280x720 HD iframe recording, which can be imported right into Apple video editing software without losing any of its quality. If this feature is important to you...the new G16 does not have this feature so it might be worth sticking with the G15.Judged by image quality alone, the Sony RX100 models are at the top of the enthusiast point and shoot heap. But if you're not interested in plunking down $650-$750, this camera offers a well-rounded shooting experience and will probably give you many years of dependable operation and great photos. This camera is soon to be replaced by the G16, which will command a $100 price premium over this model. The G16 is an overall much faster camera with about the same photo quality (maybe slightly improved high ISO performance), but if you're fine with slower AF and don't need the high burst rate of the G16, I would save your money and get the G15.", "Date": "October 2, 2012"}, {"Title": "Excellent!!!!", "Author": "fastest drummer", "ReviewID": "R13WZR2WMTY07", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I have been looking for a compact for a while. First, I got panasonic Lumix lx7. Handling of the  Lumix didn't feel right, and I ended up returning it. Then I tried Nikon P7700, which died on the first day. I really wanted it, so I got a replacement. The second Nikon came dead on arrival. So two lemons in the row. Not good. Then I ordered the G15. First impressions: The built quality is outstanding. It's built to last, and it is also \"Made in Japan\" which I think makes a statement (unlike Nikon p770 that was made in China.) The battery compartment door feels solid as well as the pop up flash. The two dials on the top are conveniently located and the ergonomics are quite comfortable. The aluminum it is made off feels good and solid. It is not too heavy not too light, just about right. There is no annoying lens cup taking on/off to worry about. Optical viewfinder is really nice to have in the bright sunlight. Size wise, it is still on a compact side, so you can fit it in a larger pocket.The power up time till first shot is quite fast. The image quality is outstanding. Of course, due to the sensor size it's not quite up to a DSLR quality if you are looking for smaller details in distant shots, but it is still very good for a compact. I think this is the best in class (maybe second to Sony RX100). The menu is very logical. Shot to shot cycle time is relatively fast in the single mode.The shutter lag is minimal,DSLR like.  You can also do up to 10 fps (burst mode) with continuing focus tracking. Awesome!!!. Really sharp pictures. You can fully customize your settings for the quick access. Macro mode is outstanding; it is really 1 cm and looks like a DSLR picture in this mode. If you need an extra rich, you can use a digital zoom extension (optical plus digital, 20x all together), which I found was helpful for some rare distant shots (minimal iq loss). Usually, I turn this feature off, but on this camera it works pretty well though. It's worth of trying.  Now the wish list:articulated swivel screen, 24mm wide lens, and a larger sensor would have been nice.Someone might wonder why not Sony rx100? To me, the built quality, size, handling, and picture quality are very important all together, and the sony is not up to the standard as far as the built quality is concerned. Sony is a very good camera and also deserves 5 stars  (for the sensor size/picture quality; it's also $150 more BTW), but to me it seems like could use a little improvement making the body a little tougher,so the flash,and battery compartment don't feel that flimsy. The canon G15 seems like a good compromise with all of these qualities I have been looking for. Even though the sensor on the G15 is significantly smaller, the picture quality is still pretty darn good. I think you will enjoy G15 for casual and vacation shooting. Due to its size, you are always going to have that with you. Have a good snapping!", "Date": "October 12, 2012"}, {"Title": "Quick summary of my first impressions of the Canon G15", "Author": "Robert V. McGarrah", "ReviewID": "R1GMM1ITOOG6H", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I have owned and loved my Canon G12 for the past two years. When I recently learned of the new G15 I wound up buying it on impulse due to my previous good luck with Canon and the promise of improved performance. Also influencing my decision was the fact that I was about to leave on a fall vacation trip which would provide a great opportunity to test the camera.I could not be happier with the performance of the G15. Here are the features that impress me the most.1. The smaller form factor does make it a bit easier to carry.2. Low light performance is incredible. Even at higher ISO's up to 1600 this camera produces very useable images.3. The image stabilization continues to be excellent and allows good handheld shots to be taken in difficult lighting situations.4. I use the movie function sometimes just to insure that I capture an optimal still image for various events. The new 1080p HD shooting mode and ability to refocus while zooming are real improvements that I find very useful.5. The elimination of the separate ISO control on the top of the camera and the rearrangement of the exposure dial control have been easy to adjust to and have not caused me any difficulty.6. The loss of the moveable rear LCD display has also turned out to be a non-problem. I only used this feature sparingly on the G12 so the larger and sharper (although fixed) LCD on the G15 is actually another improvement for me.A quick comment on the included software. I find the Canon Imagebrowser to be largely worthless for my needs. It has a strange interface from my perspective and takes up a huge amount of disk space. My main need is to edit movies. For this task the freeware program Video Pad is much superior. For RAW image manipulation the Canon Digital Photo Professional software is quite sufficient.The bottom line for me... I think Canon has done a great job of moving the G series along with the new G15. I am extremely pleased with the camera and strongly recommend it for those considering an upgrade.", "Date": "November 4, 2012"}, {"Title": "A Worthy Successor to the G12", "Author": "Pro recordist", "ReviewID": "R3FSX2KERRXEQP", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "The G15 is summed up by dpreview, in the conclusion to their multipage review, as follows: \" The Canon Powershot G15 is a well-refined product and a joy to use. It is very quick and responsive in operation, built like a tank and offers the most external controls in its class. In combination with the fast 28-140mm F1.8-2.8 lens that makes it a very versatile and pocketable photographic tool that offers almost the same degree of control as much larger DSLRs \"The G15 is highly commended by this reviewer ( I have owned one for a few weeks ) for outdoor work, where a high quality compact camera is required for convenience and portability, and it is useable at higher iso settings than any previous G series Canon. Within the 'G' series, the G10 will produce very slightly higher quality images, but only at its lowest iso setting, above which it gives up ( unless you're prepared to post process raw files). High iso settings are essential for taking photos in low light, or of night scenes like floodlit cityscapes without a tripod, and only recently in the history of digital camera development has it been possible to achieve good high iso results with compact cameras. The G15 is as good as it gets in this regard, at time of writing, for a compact camera with a fixed zoom lens. It is wonderfully fast to focus, as well.The G15 must be used with care for good results with flash. By default an evening scene will be transformed into bright daylight with all the atmosphere of the evening or nighttime lost. Best portraits indoors or in low light are usually taken with fill in flash and Canon is notoriously worse than Nikon or Fuji at getting this right in auto mode. To compare: If I set my Fujifilm X100 to auto, I get a perfect shot every time, retaining shadow detail and lowlight atmosphere with the flash set to 'on'. The G15 needs more work, but that's not to say it cannot be done. This is how, for an indoor portrait where you are within 12 feet of your subject:TIP: Set the mode dial to 'P'. Click the flash up, and set it to 'ON'. Set the iso to 200 iso. Set white balance to 'auto'. As a starting point I would suggest exposing at an exposure compensation of -2, and setting the flash compensation dial to -2 as well. Too dark? Of course it is, but now you know how to find the two settings you need to adjust! Raise one or other slowly, a little at a time, and only one at a time between each trial shot. This is trial and error, to get the result you want, but with no variables because you are only adjusting one setting at a time. When you have reached the level of brightness that you like, remember your settings, write them down, and use them for indoor portraits. Finally adjust your white balance away from 'auto' if you wish to remove a colour tint ( for example if your lighting is correct but your result looks too yellow, or blue, or orange...)TIP2:Another method: Don't use flash at all. Set the camera to auto iso. Make sure your subject is lit more brightly ( you can still be subtle about it ) than their surroundings so that they do not disappear into the shadows. Shoot. Adjust white balance as necessary. Shoot again.Combine both of the above. or even try using an external flash, which can 'bounce' or ' diffuse' the light it produces. Photography is, after all, best described as \" Painting With Light \".The G15 is a fabulous compact camera, the best 'G' series ever, and I know of several photographers who would unhesitatingly use one to take exhibition quality landscape shots to print at sizes up to A3+. At a level of expertise where the results might be mounted and sold, most semi-pro photographers would then post process, but it is not necessary to do that to create very fine photos indeed, even in auto mode if you are a beginner.I chose the G15 over all other compact cameras because it takes fabulous pictures and because of the size and shape of it, which better than all of the others, for me, allows me to hold it steady for best results, even on top of a dartmoor tor in a howling gale. And because of how fast it can focus, even in low light. And I still love my G10 ( see my review of that also if you're interested ), just as my wife continues to enjoy her G12.Thank you for reading, and I hope you enjoy your photography!", "Date": "November 22, 2012"}, {"Title": "Incredible Camera", "Author": "California Customer", "ReviewID": "R3V39U3XRC29C5", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "The Canon G15 is just what I've been waiting for, after recently selling my rugged and reliable G10 to my son (for a song, I might add).

I have owned multiple G7s for years, not having the desire to upgrade because none of the newer G series cameras brought enough to the table, or even less to the table.  The G15 brings more to the table in a big way for the following reasons:1. Larger apperature and more sensitive sensor = much much much much much better ability in low light.  No flash needed even in very low light.2. High definition video at higher frame rates (The G7 had high def, but some of the models after didn't).3. Can zoom in and out while taking video!!!! (note: at a slower rate than normal zoom, but enough)4. Adjusts exposure while taking video.5. Separate video button so you can quickly start/stop videos and take photos in rapid succession, no stopping to spin the mode dial.6. Much faster zoom.7. Can take photos at significantly shorter intervals.8. Smaller and lighter; not much, but noticeable when you tote in your pocket.  Battery is much lighter than G7's so it is a big contributor to this.9. Nicer screen - not enough to warrant an upgrade, but a nice improvement.10. Rougher finish - nice feel and easier to hold one handed.Some cons:1. The separate video button is where I like to put my thumb when one-handing it.  Not that big a deal, I expect to get used to this.2. Non articulated screen - I almost never use this, but it would be nice to rotate the screen around when non needed to protect it.

I have to admit I was slighty skeptical when it came to dropping all that cash on a point and shoot camera instead of looking at new lens for my Canon DSLR.I will not write any specs or any of the stuff all of you are most likely tired of reading or watching on YouTube, but things I know you will ALL be interested to know if the G15 is part of your wishlist.It's worth the high cost. It's literally a professional level point and shoot intended as a DSLR companion which can take advantage of your Speedlite Flash if you own one! It gives FULL manual control to your pictures as if it was your DSLR! Amazing noise control when using ISO up to 800 (noticeable after that) and of course, it's huge aperture even while fully zoomed makes it ideal for low light situations and offers excellent bokeh shots! Amazing macro capabilities.It has no tilting screen unfortunately, this in an effort to keep it's size under control. Not a big deal for me, but for others it can be an issue when comparing it to the G12.Please people, I noticed you CAN'T judge the quality of the picture you just took by looking at it from the camera itself. When looking at the from your computer, the difference is quite amazing. I was disappointed when zooming into the picture I just took from the camera itself to notice high noise and color issues only to see a perfect picture when transferred to my computer.Ability to shoot RAW+JPEG is also a very refreshing thing to see! A SanDisk Extreme 32 GB SDHC card will be ideal with this purchase. Amazing battery life in my opinion.Did I mention it feels just, right? It's tank-like construction makes me feel like if I am holding nothing but pure quality! Yes, it's not all metal like the G1X (which I don't really like at all when comparing it to this camera) but it is constructed extremely well. It can definitely survive some punishment!It's video quality of 1080p is superb! You won't be able to really obtain film-quality video with it like a camcorder but it will surely please your video recording needs when on the go! Simply look up \"G15 Video Samples\" on YouTube and turn on the 1080p option. It's really good considering everything this little camera can do.I often notice people comparing it to the Sony RX100 which is an amazing compact camera as well! But keep in mind there are a few things to consider here. I went with the G15 over the fact that I am a big Canon guy, with a Canon DSLR, lens and flashes. I want to be able to use my flash and I've grown close to Canon products. If you want to spent more money on a DSLR companion, then perhaps the Sony RX100 will be a good choice (over the G1X \"yes, I hated it\") but I personally don't see a reason to give out my G15. It feels solid, it' packed with amazing features able to satisfy my manual mode cravings and it performs beautifully (even better than the Sony RX100 based on many video reviews) when it comes to low light situations.I am happy with my purchase. It's an amazing compact companion and I take it everywhere I go!

When the price of the FZ200 actually dropped to the same neighborhood as the G15, it made the decision all the more difficult. However, in the end, I just really liked the Canon. I finally bit the bullet about three weeks ago and bought the Powershot.This is the first camera we've ever had that cost more than $200. Our previous was a basic Panasonic Lumix TZ4.Neither my wife nor myself have any basic photography knowledge. I was looking for a camera that was beginner friendly, while still offering advanced manual controls to satisfy the experts, with superior build quality and feel, and portability. Of all the cameras I researched, the G15 seemed to offer the best combination of what we were looking for.My first impressions: This a serious, quality-made instrument. You get that \"man, big-boy toys are so cool\" moment when you handle it and feel that nice rough metallic finish and how it lays just right in your hand when you hold it (it doesn't hurt to see the \"Made in Japan\" label, either). It's got enough weight to convey that it packs a lot of electronic goodness inside...I do not find it to be heavy at all, as some pro reviewers complained about.This is the first camera I decided to actually sit down and learn how to use in Manual mode. So far, I can now begin to properly adjust Aperture, Shutter Speed, and ISO on the fly and in different lighting situations (I have yet to even think about the more advanced chroma controls, such as white balance).The G15 is great for a beginner like me. The control dials are metal, thick and have that satisfying \"clickiness\" to them. The two main dials are situated so that you can easily reach them with your thumb and/or forefinger and they adjust very nicely. You don't have to worry about flying past the desired setting because the flywheel is set too loose. I know G12 users complained about the lack of a dedicated manual ISO control but since I never had it, using the ISO button on the directional pad on the back of the camera works just fine. Manual focus is a bit of a pain, since you have to use up/down buttons to adjust but I don't use it enough for that to matter much and it actually does work well when I do need it.The LCD screen is a thing of beauty. It's made of dark glass that isn't too reflective at all, and it's very bright and with excellent contrast. In anything less than direct sunlight I have not had any problems seeing the screen. The other big complaint about this G series camera is the lack of an articulating screen and, to be honest, it did factor into my looking at other cameras. However, in the end, I figured I won't miss what I never had, and it was not a deciding factor for me. I do appreciate the size difference versus cameras that have the rotating screens.The optical viewfinder was also on my list, and I've tried it out but since the last optical viewfinder I used was on disposable 35mm's from Walgreen's from like 15 years ago, I don't have any complaints about this one.The zoom is very fast and the auto focus works quite well. I rarely have to set it manually. Also, Auto mode is great for my wife, as she just wants to \"point and shoot\" the family events most of the time.The thing I've been most impressed about this camera has been what, oddly enough, several \"pro\" reviews have complained about...low light shooting. I mean, it's PHENOMENAL to a beginner like me. Last night, it was dark out...I mean way beyond twilight, just a glimmer at the horizon type of scene...and I just bust out the G15, adjust some settings in Manual and I got great pics.Of course, I have yet to crop and print any photos and that is where most \"pros\" said you can see the low light deficiencies, but again, since I have nothing even close to the quality of this G15 to compare it to, I find it's low light performance to be absolutely impressive for a Point and Shoot.Details are also amazing on close ups. I took some pics of a cured flower bud and you can zoom in and see the little crystallized hairs on it! I took a pic of my red towel and zoomed in to see each individual fiber as well as the dust clinging to them.Battery life is good. I have yet to reach full discharge in anything less than two to three days of moderate to heavy use.Another big complaint from reviewers is the lack of manual control while shooting video. While I would certainly love to have that control, I don't find myself missing it so far. This camera takes very good 1080p videos, and they look great on my 60\" 16:9 HDTV. Most modern TVs, including ours, can properly display 24fps content, so the lack of 60fps video shooting does not concern me.I use the mini HDMI to HDMI cable that came with my Kodak ZX3 to connect it to my home theater system to view photos or videos. You can also remove the SD card and use that, if your equipment supports that media.The only software I use is the Digital Photo Professional to view, edit, and convert RAW photos. I find it to be more than adequate for my needs. You have the option to install only what components you are interested in when running the setup CD.I needed to justify spending over $400 on a camera...and the Canon Powershot G15 has provided me with ample evidence that it was an excellent decision. Both my wife and I recommend it.UPDATE: It's been a little over 9 months since we purchased this camera and we love it. Every once in I while I wish it had a higher zoom, but the fast lens and bright aperture more than make up for that. I am constantly getting compliments on the family photos we take. I definitely recommend this camera.", "Date": "December 15, 2012"}, {"Title": "Great Small Camera--Buy from Amazon", "Author": "David M. Pittle \"David M. Pittle, Ph.D.\"", "ReviewID": "R1U1X1SJT9MXP1", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Wanting a small camera to carry around, I have tried several small point and shoot style cameras over the years. The latest one was a Nikon P7000. When I am deliberately doing a photo session, I like my DSLR's but they are heavy and bulky for everyday use, especially after adding a bunch of lenses.The problem with all of the P&S; cameras is that I'm spoiled. I want the camera to take a photo when I push the button. My DSLRs do that, but all the small cameras take long enough that the photo opportunity is long gone. It's called shutter-lag and it is very frustrating. Even if I do a half-press to get the focus before the moment, they still take too long. But I decided to try again after reading all the reviews. Also I do want to adjust various parameters on occasion so I can throw a background out of focus, etc.The Canon G15 has proven to be the very best of all that I have tried. It has a very short lag-time even in low light. It allows me to control every parameter from ISO to shutter speed to aperture. Even more, it does some nifty things like a credible HDR, automatically. The icing on the cake is the f1.8 lens which coupled with a very capable image stabilization means taking photos in very low light without a flash. Of course the flash is available if needed, but it is rarely needed. Well--maybe the icing for me is that it shoots RAW format that I can use in Photoshop.The full HD video is extremely good and handy. Of course the built in microphones pick up a little camera noise as they do in any camcorder.The look and feel of the camera is excellent. Well, it is a Canon. Canon, Nikon and Pentax have been my cameras for more than 40 years. It feels hefty enough to hold steady even without the image stabilization and the grip is comfortable. Controls are placed where you would expect them. The optical viewfinder is not very useful, but we've gotten used to using the large screen to compose our images. (Reminds me of the days when I used a 4x5 Linhof.)This is almost as good as my D90 cameras--well only almost. But it is the best small camera I have found.Now the only con. I didn't buy it at Amazon. I bought at another on-line seller after a friend told me that they had a special price. I buy a lot of my purchases at Amazon and should have this one. Amazon price is slightly better. More important to me, about two days after placing my order, I received a call from the vendor salesman who \"wanted to confirm the address.\" During the phone call, he tried to up-sell me on a special memory card for an additional $140 for an 8 GB card. He insisted that I could not get the full movie functionality without this high price card. I did not bite and he was lying through his teeth. There is no special card needed.

Well, I just returned from four weeks Europe (Germany, Austria, Slovenia, Italy, Switzerland, and France) and I hopped trains to get around with my trusty T4i (which I just upgraded from a T2i in June this year). There were times when I wished I had a point-n-shoot camera instead of my SLR just because of the size and weight. As I traveled around, I noticed the tourist from Japan had a Canon PowerShot G15. I do not have lens envy, I'm a hobbyist and notice things like this. I researched at my hotel and found out that the G15 was released in my home shores in mid-September.I was able to take a few shots while on holiday by offering to take pictures of my fellow travelers who owned the G15. After doing this for almost 4 weeks I was convinced that the G15 was the answer to my second, alternative, point-n-shoot fall-back camera. I like the idea of traveling overseas with a backup camera.I've had the G15 for several days and have shot over 200 pictures while learning the features. There was not one bad picture that I did not cause. The G15 is fast. I have no plans to ever give up my SLR but I now have a complete package (for me). I had a very specific need for this G15 and it meets it.", "Date": "October 14, 2012"}, {"Title": "Great in low light but some poor features", "Author": "R. J. Hunter", "ReviewID": "RRAT47SRLITTK", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "If you have a specific need for a camera with outstanding low light performance then consider the G15. Film speed goes up to ISO 12800 and the lens is really 'fast', with an aperture of f1.8 at wide angle and f2.8 at full telephoto. The trade off is that this limits the optical zoom ratio to 5x. For a general purpose camera I'd consider a zoom of 12x to be the minimum.What made the G15 attractive to me? About half of my photos are taken in high school gyms at sports like volleyball and basketball. These present a real challenge: low light, relatively fast moving objects, and the need to change focus rapidly. On the other hand the size of the court is limited so you don't need a big zoom. The specs of the G15 appear to be well matched to these conditions. I've had a Canon Powershot S5 for the last 4 years which I love, and will be happy to keep it as my everyday camera, so for me the limited zoom of the G15 wasn't a deal killer.This could have been an outstanding camera, but I think that Canon made some poor design decisions, so before discussing how it performs, here are the things I don't like:1) The ergonomics leave something to be desired. I think they were aiming for a pocket camera and tried to make it too small. It just doesn't fall comfortably to hand. For my money it should be a good half inch wider and the right hand grip should be more deeply recessed. You can't hold it with just the middle two fingers hooked round the grip, but have to actively grip it with your thumb. On the other hand I really like the position of the wheel on the front right of the camera for setting exposure time or aperture (depending on shooting mode).2) What happened to the great tilt & swivel LCD display? They've replaced it with a 'cheap' flat-against-the-back screen. This was a REALLY BAD decision. You want to hold the camera over your head? You want to rest it on a waist-high rail or fence post? You want to hold it low down to get a pic of a flower from the side? Sorry, not with the G15.3) The first thing you'll probably want to do is get a protective UV filter. Unfortuneately the lens isn't threaded for a filter so you'll have to buy the adapter tube. But this will stick out the front and then camera won't fit in your pocket any more. At the time of writing the adapter tube didn't appear to be available yet in USA.4) If you don't get a filter then you'll want to get a lens cap to protect the flimsy (and in my experience easily damaged) iris diaphragm which it has instead. There is no provision for a lens cap, but you may be able to find one that fits. If not then look in your kitchen cupboard to see if you have a plastic screw top for a sauce jar that will do the job.5) Canon used to provide handy, pocket sized, printed user manuals. Now the manual comes on CD only so if you don't carry your computer around with you you may find this annoying.6) The 'ZoomBrowser' software which Canon used to provide has now been replaced by two separate programs: an Image Browser and an Image Editor. When I installed the software it asked for a home folder for the image browser. It then complained that the folder I specified contained too many pictures snf told me to go back and pick a folder with fewer - but it didn't provide any way to do that. I guess I won't be using the Image Browser. On the other hand the Image Editor looks pretty good, but I haven't explored it in detail yet.OK, so how does the camera perform?The day it was delivered I took it to a volleyball game in a gym where the fastest exposure time I'd been able to get with my Powershot S5 was 1/80 sec. I stepped the G15 through film speeds from 800 to 12800 ISO. At each speed I stepped through the range of exposure times, and at each exposure time took a couple of pictures at different zooms. I like the improvements they have made to the way settings are displayed on screen and controlled with the finger/thumb wheels.Frankly I was impressed. The camera focusses really quickly so that instead of having to follow one player and wait for the ball to go to them I was able to follow the play, point, and shoot. I got great pictures at exposures ranging from 1/125 to 1/1000 sec. and up to full zoom. My general rule of thumb for digital cameras is that graininess starts becoming an issue at film speeds above half of the maximum, and the G15 looks to be right in that ball park.I had a very specific need which the camera meets, but I think that misfeatures like taking away the swivel screen are likely to send a lot of potential customers looking elsewhere.", "Date": "October 13, 2012"}, {"Title": "Another Great Canon Product", "Author": "David White", "ReviewID": "RFCRHHNX1KD15", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "The G15 camera did everything I had hoped it would.  The pictures are sharp and clear.  The zoom worked better than I had expected when taking distance photos at a large football stadium.  There are a multitude of photography options and settings that I have yet to use, and frankly, may never use.  The one drawback I have noticed is concerning the fixed viewing panel on the back of the camera.  The G12 offers a moveable, directional viewing panel that makes composing photos in a crowd (that is, by holding the camera above head level) much easier.  Admittedly, I had identified that issue before purchasing the G15 and am completely satisfied with it.  The G15 is smaller than the G12 and is easy to take in aircraft carry-on bags and while touring Europe.

I used that camera for over 30 years, until it became evident that film based cameras were on the way out. In between, I've used a few digital cameras, but have never been pleased with one until now. This latest offering from Canon provides a fairly large, high resolution screen that I find very easy to use. Unlike my previous cameras, I'm able to easily see what I'm photographing, even without glasses. The aperture setting, which opens to a maximum of F1.8, makes it a lot easier to photograph in lighting situations that are less than optimal. The results that I've obtained in dimly lit situations are far superior than in any of my previous cameras. The instruction book is easy to follow, and the camera itself has very intuitive menu features. I've photographed close-ups of small gold coins using both manual and automatic settings. While the auto focus feature works superbly in most situations, I found it a little bit difficult to use when shooting very small objects, such as the coins. Nonetheless, after experimenting for hours, I was able to get the technique down pretty well in auto focus mode. This was for experimental purposes only, as I enjoy the thrill of choosing my own settings, as I always did with my reliable friend, the Canon FTb. The camera is fairly thin and on the light side. While I realize that these are good features, it still takes me some time to get used to, as my old SLR felt sturdier, due to its heavy weight and proportions. I know that with time, the thinness and weight will be beneficial, as my hands aren't as strong as they used to be. The bottom line is that this is an outstanding camera, it's very easy to use, and it provides exceptional image quality. It has a superb wide angle to telephoto lens and has a very easy on the eye viewfinder. About the only negative I can think of, is that it's only 12.1 MP. In comparison to my older digital cameras, this is an upgrade, however it would have been nice to have 16 MP for those rare occasions when I want to make massive size prints. Since this is something I rarely do, all of the other positives of this camera far outweigh this minor inconvenience. This is a great digital camera, keeping the Canon tradition of high performance photography alive and well.", "Date": "October 23, 2012"}, {"Title": "Awesome", "Author": "Sam Shartzer", "ReviewID": "R15WTHGFIWP63V", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This camera replaced my old Canon S90.  So glad I made the purchase.  Before purchasing I wondered if there would be much advantage and I have been very pleased since the purchase.  For those thinking about taking a step up for a nicer camera here is what I like:-More zoom for easier composition-Much better aperture range at all zoom positions (getting the blurry backgrounds with subject in focus is way easier)-Great 3\" screen-Built in ND filter will allow me to get better motion blur in high light conditions (S90 didn't have a chance)-On screen level sensor is great for composition and eliminating bad pictures-All the knobs for adjustment are very quick to get to even with gloves on.  I especially like the dedicated exposure compensation-View finder should be nice when I am trying to get a shot of a moving object with the background blurred (race car, bicyclist, whatever).  Not having a viewfinder makes this very hard, I know.-The body feels must more like a tool than a consumer product.  I feel confident this camera will last longer.  Actually after buying the G15 the S90's ring adjuster broke and has some major lense issue.-Battery life seems betterHope this helps.  I am very happy with my purchase and don't regret buying it over the Sony RX100 that I am sure most of you are thinking about.  I also considered the comparable Nikon and Fuji.

Brown \"New Grammy\"", "ReviewID": "R2KQ05ORFNJWJW", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I am just a regular person that wanted to upgrade my camera. I am not a professional photographer. I wanted a decent camera that I can take family, nature, pet and vacation photos but it also needed to take great macro (close ups) to photograph the beadwork that I make and sell online through photos of my work. I read everything I could about available cameras in the price range I was looking to spend, comparing features, reviews and reading photography blogs for weeks and weeks. I bought this Canon G15 and couldn't be happier.My priorities when searching were as follows - in no particular orderMust be lightweight and fairly smallable to drop in my pocketbook (I keep it in a neoprene pouch)no lense cover to fumble withmust shoot manual (I really want to learn)Good Macroquality image stabilizerViewfinder (Very handy in full sun)Quality lens (always worth extra $)good zoom (many are longer but quality extended is poor on a lot of them)good in low light (Not always able to use flash & range on most regular cameras is not that great for indoor use)3\" screenarticulated screen (boo, does not have this)FAST shooting (toddler grandson)dedicated video button(baseball playing 8 yr. old grandson)Built in manual flash (I learned while researching that it is better to have manual so that you can decide for yourself, but the camera will rec. when to open the flash)So with this Canon G15, I got everything except the articulated screen. This camera is AMAZING! My husband, who has never been into taking pix has even been enjoying taking photos with this. We just went on vacation and both enjoyed playing with this camera so much. I took amazing sunrises and sunsets.  My husband took shots of the moon reflecting on the ocean that are stunning, with the camera (very easily) set to handheld night scene. I took great videos of the little guy toddling around in the surf for the 1st time and the 8 yr. old running, playing and doing flips on the beach. (Glad I insisted on a camera with a viewfinder for these beach videos)We took night shots of all the children piled in the lifeguards chair that came out wonderful. We went to a botanical garden and photographed bald eagles in trees and the zoom was fantastic, very crisp even fully extended. At the same garden we took close ups of a dragonfly that look professional. Last night we took video of our calico cat chasing her tail, so cute! Our all black cat was always difficult to photograph with my old $125.00 Sony,the photos I took of him with this camera took my breath away, so beautiful, every whisker and hair clearly defined. The macro is fantastic! Close ups of my beadwork are stunning and colors are very close to true. Much less editing work to do with the photos I'm taking with this. Quick shots of \"what I'm working on today\" to post to social media are plenty good enough to just upload with no editing at all. On our trip I took photos from my car window of the NYC skyline and other sites along the way while my hubby was driving 65 mph and they are perfectly clear. NOTE: All of the above mentioned were done with the camera set to auto - I have not learned how to use the manual controls yet. I should mention that the G15 also shoots in RAW as well as JPEG format. Although I don't know to much about RAW yet, I have been told over and over when trying to get the best photos of my beaded jewelry that I should learn to shoot in RAW. So I'm hoping to learn about that down the road.This camera is lightweight and yet it feels very solid in my hand. It fits my husbands hand well too. (So many are too tiny for his fingers to use) It's small and lightweight enough to keep it with me in my everyday life. I love not having to fuss with a lense cap. A cap makes it tougher to just throw the camera in a pocket or bag. I have the camera with me at all times in this small neoprene and velcro pouch B001EWEB3U that I throw in my pocketbook or my hubby drops in in a cargo pocket or clips it to him with one of those rock climbing clips. This case just fits the camera, nothing else.Although I have not counted how many photos the camera took on one battery charge. I will say that a full day of shooting everything in sight and charging at night worked fine for us. The battery charges in a couple of hours. I did purchase this 2 battery and AC/car charger combo pack that I'm pleased with. B006ZNBILG Always nice to have a back up battery handy and the ability to charge in the car is nice too.I bought the EyeFi Pro2 card. My photos transfer instantly to my phone and PC to share within minutes on facebook, instagram, text message, my website etc. If you share your photos on social media or text photos a lot BUY THIS CARD or a comparable one - the faster the better. People in other reviews mentioned seeing the display with the tiny hand that says busy & you need to wait to take your next photo. The faster your SD card the less likely that you will see that and need to wait. I have only seen it a few times in thousands photos taken so far.  B0090XWU8SI bought the HDMI cable and was very pleased that I could connect the camera to my TV, and in less then 1 minute, we could watch the videos and view photos we took on our TV with the family.This camera is so easy to use, the buttons are convenient. It's fast, and while it's not as small as some cameras out there, it small and lightweight enough for me, considering all that I am getting for that bit of extra size and weight. (I suggest cutting a piece of cardboard or even paper to the dimensions of the camera to get a true idea of the size. That's what I did.)It takes great photos and videos. Canon is known for the quality of their lenses. I like the potential to learn RAW and manual, but love that it takes awesome shots on auto too.I bought this book, 1285434668 hoping it will help me to learn more about the use of this specific camera and how to use manual and work in RAW. I've learned a few things from it already. It's well laid out. This is the 1st regular book - versus - digital book that I've bought in years. I think for instruction a regular book will be better for me, but it is offered in digital format also.If you're a regular person that just loves to take photos, like me, I think that you will be as happy as I am. I'm very happy with this Canon G15! I tried to really test this camera out in every way that I could think of to be sure that I wanted to keep it within the 30 days Amazon gives for their return policy. For me - this is a keeper. Before this camera I had purchased the Panasonic FZ2000. It was a great camera, but it was to big and too bulky to carry around with me all the time. It wasn't convenient or easy to grab and start shooting photos and I HATED the lense cover constantly wanting to pop off of it, so I returned it. It also needed a dedicated camera bag. I do not want that commitment.So that's my review. Sorry that it is composed kinda scattered, just writing it as I think of things I want to mention. Again - not a professional photographer. I'm not sure why the pros are even reviewing this camera. It's clearly not made for a pro. But, for someone like me, that really likes taking quality photos, all of the time, wants a camera with some features that I can grow into - or not - a lightweight, easy to carry with you camera, this is it.BOOO on the fixed screen Canon! That is why I did not give 5 stars. I really wanted the articulated screen. In my search, I could not find a camera that met every one of my wishes, but this one came the closest, so I had to settle for the fixed screen. Obviously, it was not a deal breaker but sorta dumb on Canon's part to get rid of it on this model. They put it back on the G1X but that camera has other things that I did not like about it.", "Date": "July 3, 2013"}, {"Title": "G15 will ignite your desire to know more about photography", "Author": "Eduardo", "ReviewID": "R3QO305B1LQX9J", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Hello everybody,I am not a professional photographer and do not know much about aperture, shutter speed, raw, and those specs.

I tested both, for many days, and honestly speaking, overall, this Canon is superior. The sensor is smaller than the rx100, but Canon's lens is better and its processor is a bullet, it focuses so fast (Digic 5), and the images are so SHARP, the colors so vivid.

Battery last quite long, and build quality is also very good. The design is also mostly OK, but a little more grip wouldn't hurt. Kudos to Canon for they went with just 12 megapixel, and didn't push in more pixels in this relative small sensor.Just a few quirks which I'd like to point out:The LCD with over 900K pixels is razor sharp for photo viewing, but too bad that Canon does not take advantage of that to redesign the menu interface and the fonts / icons which appears on the LCD and they're still pixelated and cheap looking.1080 HD video recording is stunning, but the 24-fps is sub-par for today's standards.The zoom ring (and shutter button too) is way too small and difficult to control.One flaw that I still have with all my Canon cameras, that is some lighting condition (mainly florescent), some colors are not accurate. Purple shows like blue. And it's difficult to correct, even with white-balance control. I must do it in Photoshop.I also don't like the mega-strap that is included with this camera.

I've started taking pictures in RAW format and have actually noticed a significant difference between JPEG and RAW.  The colors are better, shadows are more defined, and while I haven't tried this myself, those in the know say RAW format is much easier to edit in post production. Here's the thing - compared to JPEG, RAW format files are H-U-G-E (in some cases, almost EIGHT times as large!) No wonder the RAW images are prettier.  The JPEG files average out at about 3.5 - 4 Megs per photo, while the raw files are upwards of 27 megs . . .! I guess I'd better invest in some extra storage space!I have been a fan of the Powershot G series since the G1.  I have owned the G1, G5, G9, as well as SX200IS and SX40.  I was lured away from the \"traditional\" G series by the prospect of a greater optical zoom (SX200is) and ultimately the \"superzoom\" (SX40). Now I have returned to the G15 and I am overwhelmed with joy.  While the zoom and superzoom cameras take decent shots and have nice close-up capabilities, the overall quality of the photos (color balance, sharpness, depth of field) was lacking.  The superzoom had issues with vignetting and distortion of the image at the outer edges.  One of the things that the early G series (as well as most early model digital cameras) had problems with was low light shots.  The sensors couldn't handle low light situations without graininess.Enter the G15. It is a solidly constructed body, has plenty of functionality for the budding photographer and the serious amateur, takes GREAT low light shots, and just takes beautifully crisp, balanced pictures.

The user will appreciate this camera since it has a wide array of options (many built-in filters, post-processing, movie digest).This camera was chosen after conducting a fair amount of research.  The Panasonic DMC-LX7 was initially my first choice since I have owned Lumix cameras in the past.  I was very satisfied with their performance and build quality.  The LX7 is still a good choice, and the final decision may come down to personal preference.In comparison to the Panasonic LX7, here are the main reasons I chose this camera:1. Higher megapixel resolution, which still matters in the 10-12MP range.2. Better optical zoom range.  Again, this matters when you only have 5x to use.  The higher megapixel rating lets you push past the 5x optical range into the digital zoom, where you are still shooting with 9-10MP.  The Panasonic can't optically zoom past 3.8x before it starts dropping resolution below 10MP.  (If you don't print photos above 8x10 or crop your photos, then this would not impact you.)3a. Better lens.  An advanced photography website did a lens comparison with a multiple objects and a color wheel.  I could literally see how the Canon lens was better than the Panasonic.  It was not a whole lot better, but the difference was consistent.  That was really the #1 reason that swayed me.3b. Defocusing (Bokeh) for shallow depth of field.  Again, pictures posted from both cameras showed a significant difference.  Canon's shallow depth of field can't be beat at this price point.Panasonic does have more built-in filters, but the most utilized ones are available in both.  With most post-production software you can make your own creations.Other notes about the operation of the camera:- The speed to turn on and operate is fast. About 2 secs.- The Image stabilization is excellent.  I have held the camera as low as 1/2 sec with sharp pics.- It's natural default to low ISO and a wide open aperture tends to yield great photographs.- The macro setting lets you get as close as 1 inch to your subject.- The fish-eye lens setting and other options are very fun to use.  (There is an option to make the entire photo black and white except for one color, which can yield professional style pictures.  You don't have to post-edit - you can see it on the preview screen.)- Works fine with after-market brand batteries.Minor cons/ drawbacks- I found using the add-on 430EX flash creates a significant weight imbalance.  This should be expected for a camera this small.- It turns off to save the battery life fairly soon.  This can be changed in the settings.- My $250 point-and shoot had a printed manual.  My $700 DSLR had a printed manual.  This camera puts the 300 page manual on a CD-ROM, which is inconvenient.  I printed 2 pages front and back, totaling about 75 pages I put in a binder.- For a woman putting it in a purse, the size won't compare well to point-and-shoot models.  Compared to other cameras with this range of features and lens quality, its size is average.- Sometimes when reviewing photos, it takes some time to process the images taken and to show them on the LCD screen.  I have a Class 6 memory card, so it should not be a slow writer/reading issue.I am overall very impressed with this camera.

It is light enough to carry when you don't want to lug a big DSLR around and the picture quality is not far from a DSLR.

Although the optical viewfinder is nice, it needs to be upgraded for parallax correction and with some shooting information to be visible.The lens is really sharp and being able to shoot at f1.8 is really helpful in low light.Photo's are crystal clear and I have blown many up to 11x14 and they are vivid with no noise.I would highly recommend this camera for anyone wanting to take pictures seriously.", "Date": "June 15, 2013"}, {"Title": "Fast, versatile, Small and produces excellent pictures", "Author": "Hoi Ching Hui \"WH\"", "ReviewID": "R1RFIW2USBL69A", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Have owned Canon cameras for a very long time since the 2mpix S100. This is probably one of their best so far. My recent crop of Canon Cameras include the 60D, G10, t1i, rebel xt, and a few point and shoot Canons.The 60D is versatile in the way of interchange-able L lenses, Remote Flash units and so on, this G15 beats an SLR when it comes to portability and weight during travel. While it's does not have a Canon L lens, this camera produces pictures that rival my 60D with it's L Lens in lots of scenario, except in extreme cases eg. in extreme light cases when you can actually use a different lens for that scene.I bought it to be used during my overseas business travels (when I cannot be lugging around a SLRs all the time). This camera is special if you use it as is. Don't go adding flash units, lens adapters and etc. Instead, when you need to use the built in flash for example, move closer to the subject. When you want the best of it's f1.8 lens in dark scenes zoom out and walk up closer. Very good up to iso 800, and very good videos in 1080p 24.The G10 has more megapixels, but the G15 is clearly superior in detail quality in the pictures. And while the G10 has more shots per charge, the G15 is much lighter and more petite, and hence more pocket-able. I know there are many people lamenting the loss of articulating LCD, which my 60D has. But, without that, Canon made the G15 thinner than the G12, and I definitely prefer petite in this camera over the articulating LCD. I thought I would miss the ISO dial in the G10, but I haven't so far, and the G15 has consistently produced better quality shots over the G10.Canon made the G15 their \"premium\" non DSLR series over their point and shoots, and the versatility and quality of this camera is clearly shows.

A G series camera is always a part of my kit, even when my primary camera is a DSLR.The new Canon Powershot G15 is hands down one of the best high end compact cameras on the market today. The issues previous cameras in this series had have been improved and/or solved. It has very good low light performance, auto focus and shutter lag time.Shooting in Auto will create beautiful images, but once you begin to explore the multitude of tweaks that can be made to an image with the G15, you will never just point and shoot again. Lots and lots of buttons and knobs for instant adjustments to the camera.I've always felt the G10 came close to DSLRs in tweakability, features, and image quality. However, the G15 closes the gap even farther.The best camera is the one you have on you. Because it's a compact ruggedly built camera, you will shoot more, because of not being burdened with a huge DSLR body, lenses, and everything else an enthusiast or pro is liable to bring.My DSLRs only come out for the very few situations when I need to look professional, need faster focus, a brighter lens, or bulb for long exposures. Most times my G15 can handle whatever I throw at it. I love using my G15, wireless st-e2 transmitter, and a couple of speedlites together.Another thing that drew me to the G15. as well as the other G series cameras, is the Optical Viewfinder. Its very rare these days to have one on a compact camera. Its not a %100 view, but its better than nothing at all. And its great for shooting in a situation that requires stealth.I've also purchased three Carryspeed 52mm MagFilter Threaded Adapter Rings. They attach magnetically to the lens, and allow for using all types of filters. I have a Polarizer, Gradient ND, Variable ND filter attached to each one.

This becomes a little too much, especially when I also have to carry a backup body, lighting equipment etc.I bought this one after reading lots of reviews and my expectations were pretty high. Many people commented already so I will overview the great and the not so great briefly before getting to what I think I can add to the conversation.The camera is built like a tank - this is obvious the minute you take it in hand.It is smaller than those I am used to so it did take me some time to get used to its form factor.The controls are great and I was able to find my way around them almost immediately (coming from Canon DSLR) except for the zoom button, which will give you an idea of how long since I last manipulated a compact. Just to be clear it is where you would expect it, it just took ME some adjustment.The menus are obvious.The LCD is gorgeous and the same as the 7D I use most of the time.The display modes when shooting live view are very informative.I wish the manual came in dead tree form, not circular shiny plastic.The so-so: the flash management menu entry is only available when you are using the pop-up flash; not even when you attach a flash in the hot shoe.The popup flash tends to open when you carry the camera in a simple trousers pocket - I even had the camera power up and extend its lens once or twice. No damage, no biggie.No remote flash control through the pop up flash - now, THAT would have blown me away, so I won't count it as a minus.What I was mostly wondering about before receiving it were the following aspects. I give my rating in stars, max is five.- Ease of use: so close to ***** that I posted above a picture I shot with it in a total of 10 seconds from the pocket to the pocket, including color temperature selection and exposition -1 1/3eV. This was one of the first few tens of pictures I shot with it.- Color rendition - ***** - I did several tests and comparisons with a color checker and a 7D and it works very well. They end-up a little more saturated than with the 7D in my experiment, but this would be expected considering the apertures and the lenses used.- Exposure metering - ***** - In the collection of tests I did last night in my hotel room, I used a Sekonic L-308s and the 7D as reference and the results are very good. Shot two remote external flash (580ExII and YN560) and measure the aperture, set both the 7D and the G15 to that aperture and ISO and shoot the colorchecker grey card. They both come out the same and ok (proper value, no cast).- Flash control - **** There I tried with the one I had: an old 580ExII. Now let's be clear, the 580ExII on the G15 looks silly: it is three times the size of the camera - you would be excused for thinking that the thingy attached under the flash is a pocket wizard of sorts! However the results are just what you would expect: the ETTL works just fine and the resulting exposures are excellent.I only put four stars because of the SNAFU I mentioned about the menu not being accessible unless the Jimmini Cricket of a popup flash is out of its box.- Shooting in low light, others have mentioned it already, works fine. ***** See the picture I posted of the office building, the one I shot in 10 seconds.- Shooting with the flash - **** - This silly little flash is actually pretty powerful. This is not a 580ExII by any means, but at close range it can be enough. If the 580ExII were a Colt Pacificator, this would be a Derringer: cute but not harmless.- Shooting with remote controlled flash. *****\"What?!?\" can I hear you say, \"I thought there was no such capability\". Well, not natively indeed, but I had a cheap remote control solution with me so I just tried: the Yongnuo RF-603 C1 works just fine with the G15, if you accept that the remote control wire plugs in on the right side of the camera body, i.e. where you would put your hand to hold it, and of course this only works with the flash in manual. It is also controlled remotely by the same YN603.You will need a cable to plug between the G15 and the YN603; as it turns out it is the one that comes with the C1 kit as mentioned above.Nonetheless, it works.I will post a picture or two of the geared up G15.- The great and unexpected: the C1 and C2 positions on the main mode dial, that you can use for your predefined setups - just like on a pro DSLR. This is just great.- Another great feature I was not expecting: focus bracketing. I don't use it that much but I can see how it could save the day.I cannot comment on what I have not tried seriously yet: Video and HDR.So.All in all I bought this camera to ensure I will always take a backup with me, and as a walk around camera for when I don't want to lug my bigger bodies.It does that, way better than I dared hope for.A solid five stars.If you have questions, feel free to post them in comments below - I make a point of answering them.____________________________Update May 11th - I post two pictures of the mist at midnight in Guilford, CT, taken with the camera sitting on the roof of my car. The only modification I did was to rotate them slightly as I could not level the car properly :)(1) The LCD showed visible banding in the misty areas on the darkest one of the two - the picture came out just fine.(2) The colors displayed by the LCD seem pretty yellowish to me - again this is not an issue with the actual picture.Other remarks: the camera supports much more modes than what I will ever use in real life, but I made a point to test HDR (not bad if you like the style) and the various shutter release modes such as smile detection. They seem to work, provided you smile with all your teeth.Still not tested seriously: face recognition (I also have a concern with privacy rights in that case) and video. I will update this review as appropriate.____________________________Update June 21st 2013Small clarification regarding using a Yongnuo RF-603: you do NOT need the cable if you only want to remote-control the flash from the camera.You only need it to remote control the camera from yet another RF-603.", "Date": "May 5, 2013"}, {"Title": "Canon G-15 is Outstanding Backup for my SLR", "Author": "CT", "ReviewID": "RAF4XRGSQ8U26", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I've been waiting for a point and shoot that would be a decent backup for my 5D.

The lens is fast (meaning it lets in a lot of light) and the controls are excellent. The screen is also very good, being both sharp and vibrant. The file quality is as good as it gets for a small-chip (1/1.7\") sensor. In this context, the camera is a solid 4-stars.However, I bought this as an upgrade from my Canon G9, purchased almost six years ago. While a few things are improved in the G15, there are a few critical things that are not and that is why I'm giving this camera a 3-star review.What's improved from the G9 (or many other P&S; cameras from that generation).-Screen is a lot better-Lens is 1 1/3 stops faster and appears sharper.-Camera body now has a decent grip with a rubberized leather-like texture.-Higher ISO shot ability (file quality is questionable)-Movie recording is now full 1080p HD-Auto-focus feels snappierThings that are about the same in practical terms, though I consider them negatives because they haven't improved over the years:-Same megapixel count (12mp or 4000x3000 pixel images)-Sensor is same size (1/1.7\")-Same basic camera layout (neither good or bad thing)-Still requires many button pushes and deep menu access to achieve basic things even though the camera has 12 buttons (up from 11 on the G9). For example, it takes five button pushes to change flash exposure in any of the auto-exposure modes (P, Tv, Av).-While autofocus feels faster, taking a shot is actually still the same speed as the G9 - when going from idle state to the time when the shutter has taken a shot.-The tunnel vision viewfinder is really in need of improvement for a camera this expensive in 2013.-Camera over-exposes very easily and the highlights are not easy to recover even when shooting RAW.Things that are worse about the G15 vs older G-series cameras-The flash is now pop-up with a switch-The rear thumb dial is now combined with a 4-way button. So trying to rotate the thumbwheel to alter a setting can lead to accidental button pushes if one's touch is not light enough. In comparison, the G9 had a separate outer wheel and an inner 4-way button.In my experience the G15 is a modest update to a camera like the G9. I expected there to be more improvements in file quality, ergonomics, and resolution when compared to a camera that is six-years older. Overall, I'm disappointed in the G15 in the sense that it doesn't feel that strong of an update and I'll probably just stick to using my G9.", "Date": "October 28, 2013"}, {"Title": "Most of the benefits of a DSLR for modest cost, amazing quality jpegs", "Author": "Matthew Marlowe", "ReviewID": "RYB9710OVGNRA", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Everyone has their own needs with regards to cameras, but many amateur photographers are encouraged to upgrade to expensive DSLR's in order to grow their skills and produce great shots.  DSLR's have their place, but the G15 - I think - provides all the features needed in a durable form so that, unless you absolutely are certain you need a particular feature specific to a DSLR, there is no need to upgrade.  The G15 on its own is wonderful: It shoots fast, has a great lens, and produces stunning jpegs.  There are hundreds of ways to customize and extend it.  And, it just makes taking pictures fun and a seamless experience.  The live view on the G15 is also super responsive.  You will find most of the features and issues specific to a DSLR are also applicable to the G15, although the lens on the g15 is not upgradeable like a DSLR would be.Also, if you give the camera to a novice family member to take shots, the auto mode is the most intelligent I've ever seen.....odds are they will still be able to produce great shots w/o knowing what they are doing.Caveats:- Zoom range is OK but not super, if you're doing a lot of outdoor landscape photography or shooting birds/etc....well, there are better cameras built specifically for that niche, like the canon SX50.- It will produce raw format files for those wanting to do extensive post production work, but when raw mode is enabled - there is a substantial slowdown.  I'm more of an action photographer, and the G15 can give me close to a sustained 2 shots/second for up to 45 minutes when in jpeg only mode.  After a certain point, the camera might start to overheat...and thats my clue to slow down.  DSLR's may have faster processors for shooting images in raw format....the G15 is optimized for jpeg all the way through.  RAW is just a slow add on for it.- The default aspect ratio on the G15 is 4/3 which is the standard for point and shoots.  However, 3/2 is a much better general use ratio that makes it easy to introduce still photos into HD video.  DSLR's make this easy.  For the G15, you have to switch to the 3/2 aspect ratio which immediately results in a reduction in about 1 Megapixel of image quality.- The camera is small which makes it absurdly easy to carry everywhere and to hold while capturing stills and video, but that size comes at the cost of both the articulating display in prior G series cameras and practical limitations on what size equipment you'll mount to it when doing professional work.  I can mount a speed 320ex speedlite flash to the G15 and it remains barely usable...I wouldn't mount a 430EXII.  A wireless transmitter would be fine though if you can mount flash's off camera.- You will get lots of anxiety from other photographers for using a camera with such a small sensor...however the sensor and image processor on the G15 is great quality and allows taking shots with lower than normal iso which is a big win.- You will see extensive image noise if you use ISO >= 1600, the G15 is extremely sensitive to ISO levels.  90% of your shots you will be able to take at ISO400 or below though, and you can minimize the need to increase ISO either by using flash or modifying shutter/aperture. You can also enable special modes that will significantly optimize the quality of highlights and shadows in your images at the expense of a slightly higher ISO.- If you are buying the G15 because it has an optical viewfinder, I'm not sure of the quality of it...I never use it, nor do I really miss the lack of the articulating electronic viewfinder.Just as update, the following are the accessories I recommend as the minimum to get the most out of a G15:- At least 1 additional Canon NB-10L battery.  I have three batteries total which is enough to get me through the most intense of shooting days.  The built in flash can deplete a battery in under an hour.  If you are not using flash, you can probably get 4000 or so still images or a few hours of video on a single charge.  However, the batteries take awhile to recharge...and I like to have at least 1 active and 1 spare whenever I leave the house...and all three batteries when on travel.- As mentioned above, the 320EX makes the perfect complement flash for the G15.  Even if you are happy with the built in flash quality of the G15, and the built in flash is more than OK, the 320EX provides the benefit of a much faster recharge interval which is most noticeable when taking night shots.  Taking sustained shots with the internal flash at night is an aggravating experience with a 5-6 second delay between photos, essentially removing it from being able to cover action events.  The 320EX minimizes camera slow down with a high burst capability and a fast ~2 second recharge when provided with nimh rechargeable AA's.- SLIK PRO 700DX Professional Tripod with Panhead (615-315), you will need a tripod to make the best use of the video, timelapse, macro, night, and built in HDR modes of the camera.  HDR especially is sensitive to any camera movement.- Optek Premium Reference White Balance Card - 3 Card Digital Color Correction Tool- SanDisk Extreme Pro 64 GB SDXC Class 10 UHS-1 Flash Memory Card 95MB/s SDSDXPA-064G-AFFP (I have three of these cards for multi-day travel that allow me to wait until I return from a 3-7 day trip before downloading photos).  Yes, the camera seems to have a snappier response and be able to sustain a higher continuous burst rate with the 95MB/s UHS-1 cards.  Those new to the G15 might scoff at the 64GB card size or the need to take 3-4K photos/day.....just wait until they have been shooting with the G15 for a few months..the camera is so quick to respond, especially in continuous mode for action shots...it is remarkably easy to find oneself taking 10x the photos one was taking with an earlier camera.  ~200GB is what I've budgeted as the maximum I need for a week or two of shooting.  I average ~8GB/hr.- Satechi MTR-C Timer Remote Control for Canon EOS 60D, Digital Rebel XT, XTi, XSi, XS, T1i, T2i, T3i & Canon Powershot G10, G11 & Pentax K7 & ELAN SLR (Camera)  -- cheapest and best way to take extended duration timelapse videos with the G15- Case Logic DCB-303 Vertical Flash Camcorder Case (Black) (Camera) - Smallest high quality case that comfortably fits the G15 and a few accessories.

It outclasses other point and shoots in many respects.It is solidly built and handles like a precison instrument.  I am impressed by the full creative controls on the G15 and the ease of accessing them.  It of course has RAW and RAW plus JPEG capability; I would not have purchased it otherwise.  The camera fills the hand nicely.  It has a serviceable viewfinder, is of a discreet size, and has a rapid enough response for candid street or journalistic photography.  The image stabilization is very effective.  I am grateful for the exposure compensation dial, but wish that the ISO dial of earlier versions could somehow have been retained.  I am pleased with the ease of shutter and aperture adjustment in the creative modes.  The Auto Mode is excellent; however, it continues to share the vagaries of the auto white balance of other cameras.I would have rated it more highly except for what I see as two engineering tradeoffs, probably driven by marketing it as a \"Powershot\" (i.e. a point and shoot class camera).  Given today's technology, Canon's engineers should have been able to install a somewhat larger sensor, thus allowing the camera to take greater advantage of the magnificent f/1.8 lens; I would happily have paid the penalty of dropping to a 4x zoom.  Secondly, the utility of the camera is limited by the lack of a rotatable LCD; the additional minimal weight and bulk would have been worth it to me.Finally, there are two nit-pics which relate to getting the camera into action:  the flash hot shoe sometimes snags when withdrawing it from its pouch (no insert is available from Canon) and the power button is not sufficiently recessed to prevent turning the camera on accidentally.On the whole, the G 15 represents a set of clever and knowledgeable tradeoffs in re-engineering its icon small camera.

Unfortunately the focusing accuracy shooting stills left much to be desired. Although the camera has an incredible close focusing distance, attempting to shoot a macro shot of a flower's stigma was impossible unless focus was set to manual. The G15 automatically focused on a leaf 3 inches further away. Good auto focus in macro mode is required when following insects on flowers or creeping up on a briefly paused dragonfly. My A710 does this beautifully.Most of the time the camera focused normally. Occasionally, however, subjects in the center of the frame would be soft while people or things a yard or so further would be tack sharp. (Zoomed in of course. Wide angle shots were fine.) Focus points were checked while reviewing results on my computer, using Aperture, to make sure it wasn't due to operator error. It is unacceptable to have good shots ruined by what should be a simple autofocusing situation.The color reproduction shooting jpeg was also disappointing. The Canon G15 suffered in comparison to the Canon SX40HS, SX260HS and even my 8 year old Canon A710. That great Canon saturation that many photographers love was missing. Possibly the problem is particular to this individual camera.Considering the Canon G series has a great reputation, most photographers will probably be satisfied with the Canon G15 camera. It's just not the camera for me.", "Date": "June 5, 2013"}, {"Title": "Great Point and Shoot Camera with Manual Controls", "Author": "Sententia", "ReviewID": "R1A5E6TWS0F502", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I got this camera as an upgrade from my Nikon Coolpix S8100. I originally wanted the G12 which has rave reviews but is currently selling for more than it's original RSP price with many vendors, but I was able get the newer G15 camera for a cheaper price in a bundle package around the holiday season.In terms of ergonomics, what I liked about my previous camera is that it seemed substantial without being too bulky and I wanted to continue that preference. But my main reason for upgrading is that while I thoroughly enjoyed my last camera, I realized I was hitting my limitations. I'm just now starting to get into photography because I want to take higher quality photos of my travels and many images that I want to take require some manual manipulation-something that my Coolpix couldn't do. However, I wasn't ready to jump up to a DSLR  or Mirrorless camera due to the investment involved. I thought this camera would be an excellent compromise due to the Powershot line being a favorite among photographers much more talented than I. Needless to say, it doesn't disappoint.I just came back from a trip to Malaysia and Singapore and I have so many great shots, particularly night shots with minimal noise w/o a tripod, something I had a hard time accomplishing with the Coolpix 8100, which was known for taking decent low light shots.  The ability to control the intensity of the flash is a great addition.A very durable camera as well that can take a beating, especially if you plan on backpacking through Southeast Asia as I was doing. Also, I like how easy and informative the interface is as you go through features which is beneficial for someone who hasn't had a camera with manual controls before. Although I've started out in auto and scene modes, I've rapidly moved over into other modes, particularly Program and Aperture Priority after only having this camera for a month. Eventually I'll progress to manual.  So the learning curve isn't that steep. Furthermore, I was surprised at how many fellow travelers I met with much nicer cameras ( some of them professional photographers themselves) commented favorably about my camera or asked to try it out.  I think that's a clear sign that Canon has built a solid line of cameras.

Currently I am happy with my Canon DSLR t2i except for the size and weight.  There are times when I am traveling light and I needed a compact camera but it has to provide near DSLR quality photos because I am spoiled with the great photos from my t2i.  My photos must be perfect because I tend to enlarge them to 36 by 24 and hang them in my living room for my visiting guests to admire. One of my guest thought that some of my photos were taken by a professional and not by my Canon t2i.While reading consumers report, the G15 was one of the recommended compact camera so I did my research on this camera and concluded that at $299 to $399, you can't go wrong.  After using it for a month, I was so happy with this purchase that I purchased a second G15 for my brother as a gift.Here are my favorite features:  (1)  programmable C1 and C2 settings on the top dial that instantly recalls my favorite settings without going thru the menu settings again.  (2)  If the flash is in the popup position, it will always flash and if the flash is retracted, it won't.  (3) The top exposure compensation dial to lighten or darken the photos which you can do very quickly.  (4)  flash output compensation to increase output to extend the reach of the flash or reduce the output to minimize flash washout of the subject.  (5) The three inch screen is stunning and even better than my Canon t2i.  (6) Generally, it has most of the controls of my Canon DSLR t2i but the G15 controls are more user-friendly and intuitive.  It seems like Steve Jobs must have designed this camera for a serious photographer like me who needed to set the camera settings as quickly as possible without fumbling thru the various menus.  (7)  The resulting photos are near DSLR quality which I thought was amazing given the compact size.While the photos are not quite DSLR quality and results are very close.  There are better cameras than the G15 but not one of them is a better value for the money that you will pay.  This camera is a perfect complement for people who already have a DSLR camera and needed a more compact camera with near DSLR quality.  For those buyers who don't want an DSLR camera, then this is the compact camera to get.  Five stars easily but I would give it 6 stars because I paid only half the price of my Canon t2i and this camera is so user-friendly.

The crisp pictures really let you capture a scene/moment as you're actually experiencing it, as opposed to having a bright flash light highlight anything and everything within the scope of the lenses.  It's definitely larger than a traditional point and shoot camera, and is more suitable to a coat pocket than a pant pocket (very bulgy if it fits at all).

The optical viewfinder is very useful when shooting outside in sunlight. This is one of the main selling points of the camera.Far too many digital cameras that purport to be high-end models only have an LCD viewscreen available. If you can't frame what you are shooting, it makes it much harder to take a good quality shot.I also have several full-size DSLR's that I use, but in instances where I know I will walking a lot and don't need the extra zoom, I take the G15.Video quality is also excellent. I shot about an hour of video that edited down to a 10 minute video. Picture quality was almost indistinguishable from a dedicated video camcorder. The only time I noticed any difference is a shot where there is a lot of fast motion. In that case, there was some slight pixelation when I slowed down the video speed. But unless you are shooting fast-motion sports or racing, you won't see any degradation in video quality.I love this camera for it's flexibility.

As a professional photographer I don't like to carry my expensive pro gear around when I'm out and about. Yet I want to have a camera on me at all times for personal shots, practice shots, and just having fun with my camera!The G7 was great. I bought the camera and canon case where I could loop the case to my belt and I had the camera with me at all times. It lasted about 3 years before the zoom lever spring broke. Fortunately I had bought an extended warranty and got the g10 as a free replacement. Good deal! The g10 came able to shoot RAW files and I used it quite a lot as I like to do some HDR photography and you need RAW files and a tripod for this. The biggest advantage though that I found of both these cameras is their Macro feature (able to shoot close up--just inches away from the subject). With the small sensor they give a lot of depth of field (more area in focus than even a pro macro lense!). I can copy text, or small objects, car parts, whatever with great clarity.The one downside to the G10 which was a 15 megapixel camera is that it had a lot of noise at 1600 ISO. I needed less noise when shooting indoors without using flash (shooting natural light). To offset the noise/grain in the image I used a software program to reduce it but typically the image would then look softer!Amazon allowed me to trade the G10 (which was still in good working order) and get approx. $100 off the price of a new G15. The G15 comes with a faster lense and has less noise at the higher ISO's and is slightly smaller in size. This is just what I wanted! It shoots great portraits in low light without flash.The G15 comes with a new pop-up flash and I cannot get any red eye when using it (which is just amazing!). I like that they have included a dedicated button for video and also I can now shoot HD video! They added a new dial for adjusting fstop and shutter speed which is great too! (before you had to jump through the menu's which was a pain).Lastly this camera and their new line of Canon Powershots now come with Smart Auto. Will go through 37 different program modes automatically picking the one that is best for your photography situation. If the subject is moving it knows to track it! If shooting close up it automatically goes into Macro mode! Etc...Etc.  About the only time I found it not useful is when the subject is back lite! I had to pop the flash and manually force it to fire or I would get more of a sillouette.All in all this is a great camera and I would not be afraid to use it on a pro job as well.

This red button is right next to the spot where you place your right thumb when you are shooting. It is not a major problem, just a little annoying, and I do not know how to avoid it.I wanted to expand my shooting with this camera, so I purchased the filter adapter for the lens, and I now can use regular 58mm filters (B & W my favorite): a UV filter as permanent lens protection, a Polarizer to remove glare and deepen colors, a neutral density filter for those very bright days when you need less light coming in. The camera's smallest opening is f. 8.0, so this is a limitation when you are photographing in a bright background.I used to be a professional photographer, using Hasselblads (in the old days), and Canon full frame cameras, so I am very particular when it comes to camera quality and features. One of my favorites features is the HRD mode, where the camera takes three pictures at different exposures and combines them all to come up with an exposure that will handle the highlights and the shadows. I can do that in a more professional fashion with Photoshop, but doing it this way is a lot easier and quicker than getting home and manipulating three different frames into one.Camera Pro's:Compact size, large f. 1.8 lens, a rugged build, very sharp LCD, large number of choices for special effects, very good movie mode, a good value.Camera negatives:Video mode goes on too easily, would like a larger zoom ratio, an articulating LCD would have been nice, as well as a time-lapse feature, like some Sony NEX models have.I will update this review as I use this camera more.CIAO!", "Date": "August 28, 2013"}, {"Title": "Good quality for the price", "Author": "MK \"mk13books\"", "ReviewID": "R2HE7SGBXTNP05", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I absolutely adore my little camera.

As many others have reported, at times it's just not convenient to carry 30 lbs of gear, but you never want to be without a camera. Add to that some early stages of arthritis in my hands, it was time to purchase something lighter and less cumbersome. As I conducted my research, I couldn't imagine a point-and-shoot camera would meet my needs, but I was impressed by the features and reviews of this camera so I decided to make the investment. I'm writing today to say it was well worth it! I've only had it for two weeks, and I am so impressed with this camera! First - remember the shutter lag with point and shoots? Not here! That was a major concern. One of the reviews I read indicated that if you took it out of facial recognition mode, it would shoot faster, so I did that right away. While it has an \"auto\" mode, I shoot primarily in \"P\" or \"Tv (shutter priority)\" and find the exposure evaluation to be incredible, even in low light (thanks to a very fast lens!). It has 5X digital zoom, and, even when I have gone into the first two levels of optical zoom, I haven't seen any degrading of the images. Because of the excellent exposure evaluation, about the only post-processing I do in Lightroom is crop (I shoot in both RAW and jpeg).  Having used Nikon for all these years, I was surprised at how quickly I adapted to the controls and features - it's very intuitively-created and user-friendly. I also appreciate some of the more \"professional\" options such as RAW, continuous shooting, a 2.8 lens, ISO starting at 80, frequently-used settings available outside the \"Menu\" feature, etc. It's comfortable to hold (unlike my smart phone, which has been my point-and-shoot for the past year), the image stabilization feature works nicely, and I really appreciate the fact that while one is shooting movies, you can zoom in or out during the process. The only drawback I have found is that while it shoots quickly, there is a pause while it saves the image and will not shoot until that has completed. I have turned the Review feature off and think that it may be my card as much as the camera itself, and the fact that I am shooting either in RAW or in the highest resolution of jpeg. It has a continuous shoot feature, though, that I use in settings where I need shots quickly.  In spite of that, I still give this 5 stars, because, after all, it's an incredible camera in its class. If I know I'm going to be in action settings where I need incredibly fast picture-taking capabilities, I need to use my D200. Other than that, it certainly holds its own against my D200, and I highly recommend making the investment in this camera.", "Date": "May 16, 2013"}, {"Title": "Fast response, better specs and portable.

Oh yea, it should be priced relatively close to the competitors, definitely under $700 and it would be nice to have a viewfinder.I chose the G15 because it meets my criteria above, but the additional attributes really sealed the deal.  They are:1. Great IS.  I no longer worry about minor hand shakes.2. Good low light performance.  Better than I expected from a smallish 1/1.7 inch sensor.  The amazing new sensor, fast 1.8-2.8 aperture, and legendary Canon image processing engine combine to do a fabulous job in all kinds of lighting but particularly dim light conditions.  The error free white balance and quick auto focus all perform well in varied situations.3.  The video.  Well exposed indoors and out.  Videos are focused, lots of depth of field, no shakes or wunky motions, and just generally forgiving when viewed on my 25 inch computer monitor.  Camera is so light that I don't get tired holding it for extended periods.  Maximum recording time is a generous 29 minutes per clip.  I also use video for kids sports, a great complement to the DSLR.4.  Great lens.  28-140mm at f1.8-2.8 is just phenominal in such packaging.  The fact that we can get 50-140mm at f2.8, that's unheard of in the past from a P&S.;  Macro is darn good too.  I often take pictures at close-ups (sorry, this includes food at restaurants!).  Lens is where in comparison, the G1x simply became non-competitive for me, despite the larger sensor which is highly attractive otherwise.  It is also an essential feature at weddings and on hikes when I run into exotic plants, flowers, and bugs.  A bonus:  the bokeh is way better than any compacts have any right to obtain.  When the subject is close, the background is thrown off...smoothly.  Not at the levels of dedicated DSLR macro lenses, but surprisingly good.5.  Ability to attach external flash.  Having an external flash for me really distinguishes a fine compact to an extraordinary one.  I use the Canon Speedlite 320EX which can bounce the flash up in 90 degrees in both landscape and portrait orientation, as well as having the video light.6.  Finally, the handling.  All the buttons and external dials are nice and quick in use.  The build quality using magnesium alloy is as awesome as all the reviewers say it is.  The feel spoils me.The features I'd love to see in the future G series are:1. Timelapse (already implemented in G16)2. Wide angle lens and Panorama mode3.

I've found myself dreading the trade off of quality for convenience.  The G15 may well be the answer to that dilemma.  It is not a DSLR, but it can do some pretty amazing things for a point and shoot.  It has low light capability, an excellent auto-focus, and the ability to shoot RAW files.  All of this in a deceptively small frame.  The only complaints I've read so far are that it doesn't have a macro setting on the button at the top of the camera... for me this isn't an issue because if I'm going to do macro I'll probably use the DSLR anyway.  Also the view screen is not maneuverable.  I have one camera with a view screen that can tilt and twist and I pretty much never tilt or twist it.

The 5x optical zoom coupled with the ability to tweak most settings that you don't find on consumer grade cameras allow me to shoot nearly DSLR quality at a fraction of the price and size. The camera has traveled with me to Niagara Falls, several trips to Toronto, and St. Louis in the past two months and has yet to fail to impress.The autofocus is quick to focus on the subject and the camera can snap off several shots to ensure that I don't miss any action. I can pop the camera into auto mode to have a stranger take a portrait of myself in front of the falls, or I can shoot in my preferred aperture priority mode to have more control over the composition.Just like it's big brother DSLR, I find the pop-up flash to be equally worthless.I bought the camera primarily for underwater photography and it doesn't disappoint. With the WP-DC48 OEM housing, the camera can shoot underwater photos up to 40m depth with great clarity.

I've had it for a little over a month now and have decided it's a keeper. Having been a Panasonic fan for years, I was a little disappointed in my last Pany camera (ZS15) and wanted something that shoots better in low light situations. I understand that these are two very different types of cameras.  So far this camera does an amazing job inside but due to the winter weather, I've not been able to get outside to shoot very much, but I've really liked the pictures I've gotten so far. I shoot mostly in Aperture, Shutter or P mode and since I've still got so much to learn about settings, I don't always get it right but I figure that's the only way I'm gonna learn. I also shoot jpeg & not raw.  Now the one thing I don't like about the camera is that it really blows out the highlights and I've not been able to figure out the right adjustments to compensate for that. Did read in other reviews that the camera has a problem with this.  The other thing is I'm having a heck of a time finding a case to fit it.  Just want something not to big, padded, that i can carry on my belt, with an extra battery & sd card.  I've bought 2 locally and both were to small so had to return them.  I guess I'm just going to have to take the camera with me when i go shopping for a case next time.  So if anyone reads this and has found the perfect case that it will fit into with the battery & sd card and can carry on your belt, would love to hear about it. So unless you are looking for a longer zoom and articulating back screen, which Canon did away with on the G15, I would highly recommend this camera.

I knew it would outdoors and scenic and great weather in the summer. Lots of contrast. I did bring along my trusty Rebel XSI with Tamron 17-50 and 70-300 lens. But with so much on the go my rebel has been used less and less and only for specific events where I knew I was coming and going to and from home. Like kids events, photo shoot outing, sports, wedding. For the 90% of tother times I have been using my iphone 4s for most jobs. Recently on previous trip I lost many good shots with the iphone because the night photos were horrible. My friends had P&S; and all took great shots, low light, and in auto mode.My Rebel is great but other then daytime/dusk photos the lens ranges (for what I can afford) and the iso 1600 are limited for me. Many indoor shots are dark and I hate using a flash for point and shoot stuff or in sports where you can or too far. I wanted portable all day camera I can carry (little weight was ok just something I can pocket or small bag it over the SLR with no fear of breakage or getting stolen. And with little compromise to image quality. Plus I wanted video and some Bokeh.I bought a SX280 at first. But immediately returned it even after a firmware update the battery bug wouldn't go away. I was not going to risk having a faulty camera ruin my shots. After using the SX280 the zoom was great but like my other super zoom p&s; you loose speed and quality. It did take great pics for a P&S; and easy to carry and zoom and video were incredible. Photos clear. But zoom for bokeh, portraits and auto focus were little lacking. For most p&s; it was way better then anything I had seen. With the battery bug I returned and thought well what is next step up.After much research I loved the specs of the g15. I was concerned that the it was only a digic 5 not 6 over the sx280 and I would lose the speed and extra 720p slow mode modes and that the loss of zoom I would miss.After trying it out in best buy I could tell that the zoom even with digital was pretty capable and the 1-5x zoom seemed clear and sharper then the sx280 and looked like SLR on the screen.I traded it in and took hundred of photos in Maine and even did some compares with side by side of my SLR. I was impressed. All my fears were put aside. this is a great camera that has no flaws or irks during use. Sure there is some things i wish it would do a little better to make it an SLR but it isn't an SLR. Needless to say the pictures are SLR quality in some cases and in all cases being a p&s; it was more flexible then changing lenses without much loss or sacrifice for quality especially when you are going where you do not know what to expect (bring zoom, portrait,wide?)Pros:Body shape and feel is great grippy and solid rugged and looks goodButtons are easy to learn and great access to ISO,Aperture,F, in manual mode just like my slr (unlike the sx280 mind you) it was easy one hand thumb and taking pics easyScreen is awesome, I do not miss or need a touch screen. the navigation was similar to any canon and no issues. I prefer buttons up top anyway faster then looking at screen then refocus.Faster lens really helped. I traded the speed to keep the iso down and typically I could shoot under 80-160-320 iso all day and into dusk no problem and super clear low noise photos.In my compare the SLR stands out here and sharper images but this is only if you did side by side. the G15 photos are super crisp and vibrant and only in zoomed up details can you see softer edges compared to SLR.Zoom 5x was good for most shots and had great Bokeh for portraits at 1.8-2.2 range. Digital zoom worked better then I thought. You can shoot digital zoom and get nice uncropped photos for sure.Autofocus was fast, Much faster and accurate then my old rebelAWB: was accurate and better then my Rebel. I played a little with AWB but I found AWB worked in all my photos and was perfect night or day.Filters/Scenes. I rarely use the scenes but I found that since they are easily accessible from the knob they worked very well. the  filters were very fun and did a great job and made some great images. the toy,hdr,color swap were great.Colors: The Jpeg processor is spot on. Compared to edited raw photos the jpegs can be untouched IMHO. The RAW look real but flat at times (accurate) but for a P&S; the G5 had great color and pop. And the Color modes were great too. the Nostalgia and Super Vivid produced nice photos. Hybrid mode was pretty neat.Movies: WOW This thing takes great photos and zoomed in all the way to 20x with auto focus and allows use to set the color mode (super vivid for example) For videos alone this is a great HD camera. I had no problem recording 1-10min clips all day long and with no major battery drain. The sound was good too. There was some wind noise if windy but compared to the sx280 there is little lens auto focus noise. Only thing I could hear was me clicking the zoom back and fourth.Battery Life: No issues lasted for 2-3 days with all day use. And carry around was no problem. In my cargo pants pockets all day no issues or fear of losing or bulky.The interface was easy to learn and the display has some great options displaying all the info you need for the shots taken.ConsNot many but be nice to see:Movie mode has to be on in order to zoom past 5x.  Otherwise if you hit record in P mode say it only does optical up to 5xLens is great but only goes to F stop 8. I was hoping to crank it up. Not sure if this is a lens issue or hopefully could a hack later?Otherwise it is a great little camera and after using the SX280 I am glad I stayed with the G15.

The creative filters and shooting modes are a lot of fun. A couple of the features really impressed me, specifically the ability to detect a blinking subject and the ability to replace a color in camera. Its auto modes handle exposure, focus, and white balance quite well.When you want manual control, you've got it. With the exception of Bulb exposure (the G15 doesn't have it), the manual controls are everything you need to take control of your photography.The camera itself is well made. The lens is fast and clear, burst mode is fast, and the controls are easily accessible. The metal body makes the camera feel solid in your hand. It's a bit too large to be considered pocketable, but not by very much.The viewfinder is a bit lacking. It doesn't have a focal point and it's very inaccurate at zoom.

I have to admit, though, that many cameras by reputable makers (and there are many) deliver what they promise. It is more about what camera traits you are looking for. So, I would suggest to anyone looking to buy one to google 'camera trait search' and get the lay of the land.The G15 is a fixed lens camera (point and shoot, some would say), with 12.1 resolution (megapixels), and x5 zoom. Probably the most important point for this class of cameras is the sensor size, which is 1/1.7 inch CMOS-type. That is just a number, but one that matters. Most point and shoots have a 1/2.3 inch sensor, which is a couple of steps worse than the G15.It also has a viewfinder, which many don't. The ISO rating is 12,800 which makes it work better in low light. The video is a Full HD- that is 1980x1080 resolution. The camera gives you the option to control manually both the exposure and the focus. It does have an external flash option. That is a plus too, especially for portraits. The LCD screen has a 922,000 resolution, and the burst rate- for fast action- of 2.1 specified works fine. The camera also does RAW processing which would matter if you did not want to be limited by JPEG storage only. And all this with a fairly light camera weighing only 352 grams.Overall, great camera.

After a year, I sold it for $300 (Canon's hold their value - that's for sure) and I bought the crazy expensive super-hyped SONY RX-100. I ignored the bad reviews for the Sony and only listened to the hype. I was so disappointed. The Sony never once gave me a great picture - not one. It had serious focussing issues at near- and mid-distance. The color was always whacked, the images were always sad. These were the same problems that other people had, and I contacted Sony three different times - hoping they would fix my lemon. Every time they would just send me instructions on how to take a photo - as if I didn't know how to do it. Anyway, I had to live with the Sony for a long time - and I basically took pictures with my iPhone for that entire time.Enough about the Sony!

Having the dials makes it easy to manually change settings, such as with Aperture Priority. With the fast lens, the camera tends to favor larger apertures, so when I want to stop down I use AV or M settings and change the aperture to get more sharpness. I love that it shoots RAW and/or JPG, and the 1080p video is breath-taking.The monitor is very crisp and a joy to view in most lighting situations (brightness can be adjusted, too). All of the controls are intuitive and easy to use, as are the menus, especially if you've used Canon cameras before. The body feels sturdy and the non-slip finish is very effective.The only issue I've had so far is noticeable barrel distortion at wide angles, such as with cityscapes or architecture. Its not so noticeable with nature or portraits, and does fall off the more you zoom in.Battery life is fine, and the hot shoe works well with my Canon 430ex flash (though the flash is huge compared to the camera). Another note; I have a great little lens adapter tube attached to the camera, with a Sigma multi-coated 58mm UV filter. I like how this setup adds to the size of the camera (easier to hold in various ways), and it protects the lens. I just bumped it today walking through a crowded location, and didn't worry - only the edge of the filter was hit, and though light, it was nice to know it was an easily replaceable part and not the lens itself. Amazon has great prices on Canon and off-brand version of these.Over all, I definitely recommend this camera - I've found it a perfect carry-around piece.

The sensor is smaller then a DSLR, but much larger then the average point n shoot. For its size, low light performance is decent. Once you learn to balance ISO, aperture, and shutter speed, you can get some great shots. While indoor shooting with the small flash, I got some outstanding shots. The TV or time value function, set the shutter speed and everything else is done automatically, is the most valuable asset that this camera has for a user with my interests. Set the shutter speed to 1/1000th, and you can get great action shots without having to adjust the settings every shot. Video is decent, good enough for a digital camera.

I've had it out of the box for about 4 hours now and I made myself put it down to write this review. It has nearly every bit of functionality as a DSLR packed into what I would describe as a medium large point and shoot. It's an old-school boxy-style camera bursting with advanced features. I will mention that the boxy style is where my one con comes into play- the camera is at least double the weight of my largest point and shoot and because it's boxier and less ergonomic it was beginning to fatigue my hand a bit after a couple hours (however, my eventual hand deformity is a small price pay for the joy of using it). Now, I'll just mention a few highlights of my short time playing with it. First, I was not aware but know now that it takes HDR photos and processes the image in camera or you can use the bracketed images to create the image in 3rd party software. It dials in a sky-high ISO of 12000 which of course didn't produce the best images when I tested it but I say ya never know when you just might need it and it doesn't hurt to have the option. I'm accustomed to shooting in RAW and Aperture Priority mode on my DSLRs and this of course, allows me the same freedoms. The aperture range spans a wonderfully fast f1.8 with great bokeh to an all-encompassing f8.0. An initial selling point for me was the hot shoe providing the ability to attach an external flash but the small convenient on-camera flash with it's plethora of controls allows nearly the same results as my speedlite (nearly, not all). I'm also excited to use the easily accessible dedicated exposure compensation dial right on the top which I'm sure will be a game changer for me. I really could go on and on but suffice it to say that if you're a serious shooter- this is the true definition of bang for your buck! It's not an inexpensive point and shoot but there's a very solid reason for that- lots and lots of bang!In a nutshell-  If you use and enjoy the freedom of a DSLR, you'll get 85% of that same freedom and creative manipulation without the bulk of all the gear.", "Date": "March 12, 2013"}, {"Title": "The perfect photographer's companion!", "Author": "Dennis Vogelsang", "ReviewID": "R1QVP4ZVGBFVS8", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I'll keep this review short and to the point:After trying to find the right 'compact' camera to take with me when not lugging around my DSLR and trying several different ones, including the Fuji X100 and Canon's G1X, I finally found what I was looking for: The Canon G15.Sure, the X100 has a better APC-S sized sensor and a brilliant viewfinder but that's where it ends for me. The X100 lacks fun and having no zoom gets old very quickly. The G15's sensor is surprisingly good and combined with the new Digic 5 processor and f/1.8 lens, it matches the X100's low light performance.I'm not even going into talking about Canon's G1X.

I would love to have been able to use this for street photography, but because Canon saw fit to do away with the articulated tilt screen, this is not so very practicable now. It's so much easier to get great candid shots of people when you're not so obviously balancing a camera out in front of you at chin level or higher, trying to compose your shot. With a tilt screen or articulated screen you just casually hang your head to look down at the screen, and a quiet, incognito, stealth shot, with the camera hanging low in front at chest level, is so much easier to carry off discreetly and without bringing attention to yourself. With a fixed screen - not. Huge disappointment in that department. What was Canon thinking? Did someone at the design meeting say: \"Gentlemen, perhaps we should step back a pace. This camera is so awesome that if we included the tilt screen, like we did for its last 3 predecessors, we'd leave the competition choking in our wake. That would not be fair. Gotta keep the competitors healthy and happy. Let's ditch the tilt screen.\" How logical was that???So, now I'm faced with trying to decide between this camera and its close competitor the very cool, but somewhat slower-to-focus Nikon P7700. Also, the Nikon's flash is virtually unusable on macro photos because it casts the lens' shadow over your subject. Even though the Nikon also has a 20x zoom lens in its favor and many other awesome features, that slower focus is kind of off-putting... After all, usually you want to actually capture \"that\" moment, not the one that comes 2.5 seconds later. Also, I love macro photography and really resent that shadow. Who designed that flash anyway???Hence, my dilemma. What to do...?  What to do...?", "Date": "April 9, 2013"}, {"Title": "Canon G15 - works well for me", "Author": "Kendall F.

There are two features that are especially important to me: an optical viewfinder and RAW file capability. The G15 is one of the few cameras that offers both. I don't always use the optical viewfinder, but I like having it because it's intuitive for someone who typically shoots with a DSLR. I use Lightroom to process image files, which give me more exposure flexibility than regular JPG files.The camera itself is solidly built and even seems a bit heavy. I actually like that. It fits comfortably in my hands and it's easy to hold steady because of the weight. The surface is textured, which gives a feeling of confidence that it's not going to slip out of my hands. (I use an Op/tech hand strap). It's too big and heavy to slip into a shirt pocket,  carry it in my pants or jacket pocket. The controls are easy to manipulate. One feature missing is an articulated viewscreen. Never having had a camera with one, I probably don't know what I'm missing, but it hasn't been something that I've felt I had to have.The camera's features, beyond the usual settings, are too extensive to review here. In my experience, the average shooter uses 25% of a given camera's features 75% of the time because they/we tend to shoot the same subjects under similar conditions. I recommend that you download the manual from Canon to get an idea of the breadth (impressive) of its features and the potential for complexity. If you just want to shoot JPGs in auto or in a scene mode, you may be spending more money than necessary. I shoot primarily aperture priority with RAW files and like the flexibility the camera offers if I wanted to shoot in different settings. Otherwise, the G15 provides the same features most consumer digital cameras offer. To those who are interested the fixed lens provides a 28-140mm equivalent focal length range, but is a stop and a third faster, at F1.8-2.8 then its well-respected predecessor, the G12. That makes it good for indoor use, and you may be able to get away without using a flash in low light conditions with a high ISO. (I hate on-camera flash because it makes everyone look over-exposed and covers too little area, unless you spring for an add-on flash unit, which starts to defeat the purpose of having a small camera.) Focusing is wicked-fast, faster than the G12 according to the specs.The G15 also shoots impressive video, another feature I like, although I can't say I've used it all that much. While most digital cameras shoot video, this is an expected feature, but coupled with a fast lens and solid camera, it beats the heck out of anything your phone can produce.Bottom line: this is the camera I wanted. I wouldn't mind a longer telephoto, but I didn't buy it for nature work. Between the fast lens, RAW capacity, and exposure options, it's what I wanted to carry around when a DSLR is just overkill. And, if my DSLR should fail on a photo shoot, the G15 could step in and take over in many situations. I like having it for a backup.", "Date": "May 4, 2013"}, {"Title": "Lived up to all expectations", "Author": "Born in a Library", "ReviewID": "RW94D4CCGNAT0", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "The size is perfect.

Another minor thing that I love about it is the control dial on the back.

While it has no bulb setting, I figured that the combination of ISO 800-1600 plus the 15 second maximum exposure would allow me to photograph in most conditions excepting moonlit landscapes. What neither Canon's description nor any of the reviews mention is that once you increase the shutter speed past 1 second, you are locked into 80 ISO! In other words, your exposure should be 2 seconds or longer at 200, 400, 800, 1600? Nope, not going to happen. You are stuck at ISO 80. I understand the image quality degrades with the combination of high ISO and long exposure, but geez Canon, if that's what I want to shoot, let me do it! If you are going to advertise high ISO shooting and 15 second shutter speeds, it would really be nice to know that it's one or the other!I almost returned the camera based on this failing, (which I admit is very specific to my needs) but it performs so well in all other aspects that I decided to keep it.

Nichols \"nicho114\"", "ReviewID": "RV2VWP0WBHJCR", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "After several years with a low-quality, consumer-grade pinprick sized CCD point-and-shoot, I purchased the Canon G15 for use during a vacation to San Francisco in February.  Though I may not be a professional photographer, I know the basic rules of the game, and can generally do a better job composing a picture using manual settings than any digital camera that I've previously encountered can by itself.  Let me say that, against all expectations, I now shoot pictures mostly in Priority mode, as even full auto on this baby impresses.  I'm not saying that the camera is perfect, but it's a sure sight closer than any other compact camera I've ever handled.First, the good.  Actually, most of this is great.  The G15 has a very \"bright\" lens (f 1.8 at widest angle), making it excellent for low-light photography despite its' relatively small 1-1.7\" sensor.  Further, the camera's anti-shake compensation is excellent, making a low-light superstar acutally usable in-hand, even in darkened museum galleries.  Last on this point, the macro is awesome, due to the physics of the small sensor/short barrel length relationship.  Clear pictures can be had all-around, especially if braced against the ground or some sort of support while shooting, even without flash or AF assist beam.  Colors are bright and punchy, and image noise in .jpg format at low ISO is extremely low.  Format-wise, even though it's something I'm not really advanced enough to tackle on my own, one can obtain Canon RAW format images from this camera, even when shooting to produce .jpg's.  This, actually, is one of the reasons I shoot in priority mode, as one has the option to select an especially high-quality .jpg compression not available in auto, while keeping copies of the RAW images saved to the memory card all at once.Next, the not-so-good.  And, really, at the price-point, there isn't much to go over.  This camera, as many other reviewers have related, blows out exposure pretty easily.  It's best to use the manual exposure compensation control to step back at least 1/3 stop at ALL times, even shooting flashless in low light when your subject has 'high albedo.'  When outdoors in full sunlight?  Shoot at ISO 80, back off exposure at least a full stop, and think about engaging the built-in neutral density filter if you're anywhere near water and/or open sky.  And with flash, turn down intensity and step back from your subject more than you think is wise.  Second, though performance is good at ISO 400, I wouldn't ever use pics shot at over ISO 800 if I were being paid to, unless it's fireworks on the 4th of July.  The image noise is inexcusable.  Maybe if I had a tripod, it would be different, but most images I've shot like this look terrible.  And, performance is heads and tails BETTER than competition in this category of camera, generally speaking.Last, let's go for the neutral.  I am not the world's best photographer...  I don't need a fiddly, fancy DSLR like Japanese tourists or San Francisco's average hipster.  What I wanted, and what I got with this camera, was a reasonably sized tool with modest manual configuration options that is good at shooting sans-flash.  Along with that filthy word 'manual', however, goes a lot of baggage for people who like bells and whistles.  If you want GPS, automatic panorama stitch on-camera rather than just a composition assist, compact ultra-zoom, ultra-wide-angle shooting, etc., look elsewhere.  Fortunately for me, I just wanted a camera that would do what I told it once in awhile, rather than making every picture look like a staticky tinker-toy image.  And, really, this thing still does more than I need it to.  It shoots RAW, which I am not yet educated enough to edit.  It has a hot-shoe flash, which will likely take me a while to learn to use properly so as not to blow out images in an even more spectacular fashion than with just the built-in, pop-up flash.  The menus, while well-laid-out, are deep, and take a little time to fully understand...

The method for attaching filters is a joke; you have to put a tube over the lens, so the tube has to extend out further than the lens at maximum zoom, which means with it on you can't put the camera into its case.  I would also prefer to have an electronic viewfinder instead of the optical one as I use this camera almost exclusively outside in bright light and thus don't use the screen much.  The EVF would give me the info on the screen and also be more accurate framing than the optical viewfinder.

Maybe I have smaller hands, but I really like the way this fits in mine and for the most part, the controls are laid out in manner that allows me to make changes quickly (in many cases, with one hand).  I also like the texture of the case. It is not rubbery, but it still seems to be an excellent non-slip surface. I also do not miss the articulating screen since the G7 did not have one, and I find the size, quality and the wide view-angle makes it usable above and below your eye-line.The lens is fast & sharp, and I have noticed that depth-of-field seems better as well. I believe this is a result of using this lens and a larger CMOS sensor. Owning a couple of DSLRs, I am happy to report that the shutter action seems much better as well, probably due to the DIGIC 5 processor, which also allows a few more features like HDR, and multi-frame noise reduction. I also like that you can turn the display off and use the viewfinder only.  This helps reduce battery drain and as a side benefit, allowing faster shutter response.One thing that has not been identified in other reviews is the really good video quality with a separate record button that can be used in any mode and zoom control while recording.  I also like the fact that you can use the digital zoom and there does not appear to be any digital artifacts, which makes wonder if they are using the full sensor for this. I also appreciate the ND filter that is built in.  This really helps when shooting video outdoors on a clear day.There have been concerns about not having a printed manual. There is a detailed manual and it is in PDF format on the CD, or on Canon's website.  I personally do not think this is a problem since I have many ways to read PDFs and actually prefer my iPad as a reading device.  Also, if you put the PDF in the cloud, you always have access to it.My only complaints and they are minor, is still not offering an external mic input or WIFI.  WIFI would be nice for instantly pushing an image or video up to the web, but I guess if this is important to you can always use eye-Fi or similar type products.After using my wife's iPhone or my own Galaxy Nexus, I can say that having a cameras like this still provide much more flexibility.  I find this to be perfect portable camera that does fit in your pocket if you wear cargo pants, jacket, or camera vest.

I tried it out on a variety of everyday situations, and it seemed to work reasonably well, although the viewfinder turned out to be even more worthless then mentioned in other reviews. The wide angle was less wide than my previous camera, but I thought it would be OK for most pictures. It wasn't until I started using it on my trip that I discovered that this camera has very serious flaws which are especially evident at long distance shots. When shooting at maximum wide angle, the LCD  shows a wider field of view than the camera can actually photograph. Everything looks good on the LCD up to pressing the shutter button, but when the display comes up afterward, the result is cropped picture about 5-10% smaller on the LCD screen (and on the memory card) than was shown in the preview. If you try to take a near maximum width picture of a wide building, the sides get cut off. If you notice the cropping when the two second display comes up, in theory you can back up and take an overly large picture, but I found in many city situations the combination of the limited wide angle capability and this cropping made taking the picture of a moderately wide building or similar subject impossible. There was an even worse problem, however. Every so often I would take a carefully composed photo, and the the result would the a picture skewed up or down by about 20%, from what was shown in the viewfinder when I clicked the shutter. It turns out that you can carefully click the shutter, wait for the screen to go dark and the shutter sounds to complete, but apparently the camera has still not captured the image. I found I had to wait and hold the camera steady for a couple of seconds or so after the shutter click to make sure the picture registered properly. To be really safe, you need to wait for the preview to come up and look at it carefully. Needless to say these problems are a disaster if you are taking any sort of action scene.

I wanted it to replace a G10 which was also a good camera, just a little beat up with wear and not working as well as it used to.  Before buy this camera I bought another Canon product, the PowerShot SX500IS which I returned after 2 days (to a store) mostly because I hadn't realized it didn't have a view finder.My first (so far only) annoyance with this camera is it didn't come with a memory card at all.  Perhaps it said that in the ad, I doubt it.  Fortunately, I kept the one from my G10 and that fit fine.  While the battery was charging I started to study the camera and was alarmed that I couldn't find the self-timer button. One of the reasons I've bought several Canons in a row is they tend to have the same location or at least the same symbol for the self-timer.  However, after a short time I stumbled across the \"short cut\" button and without being extremely technically smart, I was able to figure out how to set my \"short cut\" to the self timer which is very wonderful.  Sorry I don't remember what other choices there were but it was many.  I'm 64, my learning curve is not as fast as it once was but I can read.  There are certain kinds of things I let others do for me if they are around.  But since my pets don't have  thumbs, I managed to set the date, time, country, attach the camera strap by myself.I'm not sure how long the battery took to charge because I left the house for about 1 1/2 hours and it was done when I got back.I have an iMac and the photos transferred well into iPhoto.

Lastly, the initiation of movie recording is different from other manufacturers' actions. The G15 has a \"dedicated movie button\", which is not unusual; what is strange is that the movie button is the only way you can begin recording your video. The camera has a movie scene mode on the mode dial; however, when the movie scene mode is selected, pressing the shutter button takes a still photo instead of initiating video recording.

But Canon never expects that GIX would be a flop. The selling point of G1X is the overly large Sensor. But to keep the camera size not too much bigger, the Lens have to be slower & no close-up.  Thinking people will buy a large Sensor, by giving up other features, was a mistake. People buy the camera to use, then they show it off. If it is not good to use, they just don't buy it.  Assuming the slower G1X sales would make up by higher sales volume on G15 did not materialize because of the G15 fixed screen. And with all the competitions, it is no longer the only good choice.  So what was started as a good give-and-take of features for the two cameras had turned into a nightmare for both. People don't buy G1X for the slow and non-close-up Lens and don't buy G15 for the non swing Screen.Solution: G1X - Increase the size of the camera for a faster Lens and better Closeup  or reduce Sensor size to approx four-third, also for faster & better close-up Lens.  G15 - swing Screen. If Canon is not reducing G1X Sensor size,  then it should Increase the G15 Sensor size somewhat.

I wanted to upgrade to this G15, thinking it would be an amazing way to upgrade, considering all the good reviews I found for it on the Internet.

This looked especially annoying with people's faces and with walls and curtains and hanging pictures. Ever see a person's face in a black hole warp? Get a person on the side of a photo taken with this camera.I emailed customer support, sure something was wrong with the camera. They tried to help, but nothing worked. I called technical support. They tried to help, but nothing worked, and they said I should send it in to the Canon service center on the east coast. I ponied up $18 in UPS charges to insure and send the thing--obliterating the savings I had gained by buying it form Amazon instead of an actual store. Canon held onto it so long, without a resolution, that the time passed when I could just return it to Amazon--so I can no longer return it, because of Canon. Finally they contacted me and said it might be barrel distortion, but that this was all within the specs for the camera. They asked me to describe the problem again. I did, and they said they would look at it again and get back to me.In the meantime, I looked up barrel distortion on the Internet (I did not previously know what that was) and found a couple of sites explaining that this thing is inherent to wide-angle zoom lenses, and that the only way to fix it is either to not take photos in wide angle, or to Photoshop it out using a lens filter. Well, you don't actually get a choice of taking a photo in wide angle or not with this camera, unless you zoom every photo, because the un-zoomed setting is always wide-angle. Also, Photoshop does not yet have a lens filter for this particular lens--Photoshop does have a lens filter for the G10 and G12, but the G15 lens is special because of its F1.8-F2.8 range. I tried using Photoshop to clean up some of my photos, but the G10 and G12 lens filters didn't work. And in any case, I shouldn't have to use Photoshop on every picture I take.Finally Canon decided to send me the camera back, about a week ago, well into the start of February, a month after I sent it in for repair. They did nothing to it. It still works the same. And I can't send it back to Amazon to get my money back.The camera does have excellent automatic light adjustment and battery charge life, far better than my A570. But my A570 takes far better pictures, since it does not warp people's heads into black holes.If you looking for a camera to take normal photos, DO NOT BUY THIS CAMERA.

Just got back from vacation and am feeling less than pleased.- I *really* dislike the lag after pressing the shutter button. Just a split second, but enough that I missed shot after shot.- This one is personal opinion: I do not like having to use the screen to compose shots. I much much prefer the viewfinder/eyepiece, but the offset from the lens is so bad its not really an option.- That delicate lens cover? Yeah, my lens got scratched. And yes I do own a case for it. Obviously it happened some other time, something brushed against it enough to move the cover and put a nice mark on my glass.- The auto/P/Tv/Av etc dial on top turns *too* easily.

While the video on the G15 is superior to the G12, the still photos are not consistently sharp. You expect more from a camera with this price tag.

I bought a leather case for the camera and it was awkward to to get it off while out taking pictures, so I took it off and now the G-15 has been through heat and rain and cold and snow and has been dropped and bumped and covered in dust and it just keeps on ticking.  And some beer has splashed on it too when taking pictures of bands.On the coldest days of the recent winter the camera operated flawlessly and took some amazing shots.  It is not great for action shots, but for low light sunrises and my bird watching, it is excellent.  The fisheye lens feature is also great and it has a pretty robust bunch of settings for most imaginable shots.The viewfinder is worthless, but the non-articulating screen is excellent and it has the great dual axis electronic level display.The real star  is the the camera's 28mm Wide-Angle 5x Optical Zoom lens with a focal length of 6.1-30.5mm (35mm film equivalent: 28-140mm) achieves f/1.8-f/2.8, it is amazingly versatile in every situation.All this fits in your pocket, has awesome battery life and is incredibly durable.  I just clean it regularly and think that next time I want a great video camera, I will get a video camera, but when I want a camera that can go anywhere and take great pictures, I grab the G-15.[Wow, third Canon camera and this one is small and has great battery life, but the pictures aren't great and the HD video, which is why I bought this camera, is horrible because the picture is great, but the sound is rice krispies meets milk.  Plus, less than 90 days return cost me -- if I had bought this camera at Best Buy or Wall Mart, they would, at minimun replace the camera to make sure I didn't get an expensive lemon for no extra cost.

Went a few extra dollars for this camera based on all the great reviews. Just got it and used it this weekend. I must say I am not that impressed (though only used the 'Auto' mode). With pictures outside in gorgeous daylight the highlights are washed out and darks are very dark. Also, the clarity is not really great. Again, I was really expecting better pics than my 6 year old $99 Kodak, the fact that it's 6 year newer technology, and that it's about $100 over the average top rated point and clicks out there.. I am having buyers remorse at the moment. Maybe I need to get more into the manual settings... ? As far as video, decent, but the wind noise was bad even on a relatively non windy day.

I felt the grip was not big enough to keep the camera from falling out of my hands. I ride on the back of a motorcycle with my husband driving and I'm busy taking pictures.  My older Canon Powershot has a larger grip, so the wind isn't able to whip the camera out of my hand, and I can keep the camera steady despite the airflow frm any direction.  I also take many photos holding the camera under, over and in things that my head won't fit into.  The new buttons on the G15 get in the way, and change the settings.  When reviewing my photos, and try to turn the cam for friends to see, my thumb hits something that takes the photo off the screen.  Its very annoying to go back, find the photo and try to turn the screen to share the photo with friends. Finally, the photos are beautiful as I would expect, but would rather add a Wide Angle lens, than to have every photo taken with Wide Angle. I would rather have the normal lens and switch out when needed.", "Date": "February 3, 2013"}, {"Title": "Canon Saves a buck at customer cost!", "Author": "Johnnie P Robnett", "ReviewID": "R3HAOZGNW6MG9L", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "This review highlights Canon and with but minor comments on the camera. I own and have owned a number of Canon cameras and have been satisfied that these products were worth the their cost. That is until now and the lack is for Canon's performance and not the camera. For example, Canon requires a USB Cable (Camera end Mini-B but does not supply one - however they do offer it as an accessory for sale!) according to the supplied Getting Started booklet to upload their software, which includes the User Guide in PDF format (a printed User's Guide is not provided OR offered). Once the cable is acquired and the upload is begun the computer screen has the option to not connect the camera to the computer to upload the software. Supplying the required cable OR sentence in the Getting Started booklet solves this problem. Also, the User's Guide explains how to implement various functions (e.g., setting \"Scene options\" or \"P Mode\" options) but does not include how to cancel these selections - this takes experimentation  on the users part - and time is money. In summary, I anticipate the Canon PowerShot G15 will perform up to my expectations but at a cost that was unanticipated nor necessary.

This is one of the most requested features ever. Every time Canon release a new p&s; camera, hundreds of people around the net inquire, and the answer is always \"no\". Such was the case with the s95/ s100/ s110/ G12/ and G1x. Why won't Canon just grant their users this simple request? I (like many others) are supporting other brands because of this one (repeated) kick to the groin by Canon. PLEASE Canon, just add manual control in video like your competitors are doing for us. Pentax did it with the Q, Nikon w/ the V1 & J1, Panasonic w/ the LX-5 & LX-7, Sony w/ the rx100 & NEX Series, Olympus has full manual with the E-P2/3, etc, etc. A $500 \"advanced p&s;\" should have it.
