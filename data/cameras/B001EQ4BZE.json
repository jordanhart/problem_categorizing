After my Fuji MX600ZOOM finally called it quits after 10 years, I chose the Canon A2000-IS after a pretty extensive search.  Pictures are excellent, macro works incredibly well, video is clear and smooth as my video camera, and it's so nice to have a 6X optical camera that will easily fit in my shirt pocket.Some complained about poor write speeds, and I can tell you at max resolution, max picture size, it takes just about 2 seconds for mine to write.  The reason is, I didn't skimp on the SD card.  I bought Sandisk's 20 MB/s SDHC in 8 GB size. ($47, but $20 rebate)  I almost went for their 30 MB/s card ($67) but I figureed 20 was fast enough for me.  Now if you stick a $12 Walmart special in, then yea, it will take a while to write the photo to it.In closing, i your looking for a high quality compact digital camera, you won't go wrong with this one as long as you don't feed it crappy SD cards.", "Date": "June 20, 2009"}, {"Title": "Right for the price", "Author": "Amazon Customer", "ReviewID": "RD68IHGR60W85", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I think this camera deserves four stars. I have used at least 10 digital cameras in the past 10 years, not counting the SLRs.  At this price, $249, I think what this camera offers is as good as you can get from a pocket camera.  There are some pros and cons but the pros far outweigh the cons.  I like the A2000's solid feel and weight, unlike the flimsy feel of the most other recent A series, such as my A570is.  The pictures are as good as, if not better than, any pocket camera at this price.  There are complaints about noise, but again find me better pictures from the same class of cameras.The features, however, are what please me. I am not going to repeat them since it's on the product description, but the use of AA batteries and 6x zoom are must haves for me.  For better pictures quality, I use my SLR, but for pocket convenience, I'll just enjoy this for the time being, until the technology catches up with our unquenchable taste.-----Added------After using it for a while, I couldn't understand how anyone would rate this camera lower than 3 stars without good reasons.

It replaced my old Canon A470, which got wet on Iguassu Falls, Brazil and as a result got a problem with full opening lens.First of all, new camera has perfect 6X zoom and of cause very convenient big 3\" screen. It works just great even compare with higher  class and much more expensive cameras by another brands. A few people of our tour group made pictures at the same conditions (for example on acrobats show) using different type of cameras. My photos were the best, even without flush and far from the stage.Yes, you have to wait a few seconds to recharge the flush, but it compensates with using just 2 AA batteries (you always have spare).By the way, I am using Sony rechargeable battery (thanks for one of Amazon reviewer)and it works perfect for quite long time and hundreds of pictures made even in the night.So if you are not so picky and not professional, but average user,like me, it is a really great camera for universal purposes. I am very satisfied  with my purchase.", "Date": "March 11, 2009"}, {"Title": "Excellent pocket camera", "Author": "David D", "ReviewID": "R1YF0W4LAOZDGX", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I bought this camera after trying the latest pocket Nikon, the L20.  I found the menus on the L20 a little frustrating and the colors recorded in dim light (outdoor twilight) to be a little off.  I also have a Canon SX10 which I have been very pleased with, so I thought I would try one of the Canon pocket offerings and I have indeed been pleased.  I'll give the usual pros and cons:Pros:Takes great shots on the auto setting.The optical image stablization works excellent even on maximum zoom.  I shot quite a few indoor photos at full zoom and about 90% came out great.  Granted, it was pretty brightly lit indoors, but previous cameras I've owned usually wound up with blurry photos.The dial on the top makes it easy to flip between different shooting modes.  I was surprised how much I liked having this dial vs. the Nikon L20 which is all menu-driven.The camera survived a drop from about 4' onto cement without a scratch or any internal damage.  And no, I didn't do that on purpose. ;)The camera takes AA batteries which I have always liked - great when traveling.The display on the back is large and easy to see even in bright light.The 6x zoom lens is great.The battery life is great.  I shot about 140 shots, some of them with flash, and the \"low battery\" light didn't even come on.Cons:It's awfully big for a pocket camera.  It just barely fits in my front pocket.  It may not seem much bigger than the Nikon L20, but when you hold it in your hand you realize it's a fair bit heavier and noticeably larger.The flash does take a long time to recharge, depending on the strength it used in the previous photo.  I have read numerous other reviews stating the same thing.  It's about what you would expect from a AA-powered camera.Lastly, it's not as sexy-looking as other offerings from Nikon.  All they would have to do is paint it red... oh well.Final thoughts:I have own some Kodak pocket-sized AA cameras before and found them generally poorly-made.  So, I ruled them out on this purchase.  I also looked at an Olympus, but in the end went with the Canon and have not been disappointed.", "Date": "June 28, 2009"}, {"Title": "Terrific Camera", "Author": "Daisy", "ReviewID": "R3R2GO6L10HYIE", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Amazon was great!  Said \"shipment\" in 1-4 weeks (plus delivery time); actually, it was \"delivered\" in 9 days (using free saver shipping).  Plus, their price was $10 less than the featured vendor.Got this camera after much research, to complement my \"big\" ultra-zoom.  Needed something that used AA batts, SD cards, decent zoom, enuf program functions/features, yet small to fit in my shirt pocket.  The Canon A2000 is perfect.  The size/weight and wedge shape are right for one-handed usage (the smaller ones are harder to hold).  And, I like the solid feel and construction.Would have prefered an EVP viewfinder in addition to the 3\" LCD, but since Canon only has an optical VF (on the A1000), it didn't bother me to lose it.  Yes, it's a little hard to see the LCD at angles, but enuf of the image is visible to know what you're framing, and between the IS and sensors, the exposure/focus is fine.  Bright sunlight is also an issue with the LCD, but again, enuf is visible.  This is not a $300+ camera; given it's $160 price, it's awesome!Regarding the delay time, I have not experienced any problem (using rechargeable 2650 mha batts).  Non-flash shots are virtually 1 sec delay; continuous mode shots are about 1/2 sec apart, flash shots are about 3 sec delay.  Often, the only problem is that you need to adjust many of the default settings - reduce image to 6MB & Fine, IS to \"shoot\" not \"continuous\", reduce the review time, etc.  Oh, and I'm using just a \"standard\" SD card.The quik-use functions (ISO, flash, drive mode) are very easily accessible.  The Macro/Landscape quik-access is very handy to have.  The AEL and AFL are very handy and easy to use (after you read the manual to find out how), and I programed the print button to use WB.", "Date": "May 19, 2009"}, {"Title": "Snappy Little Camera", "Author": "V.

The pictures are crisp, even with the zoom. It is a wonderful point and shoot to own and I have taken hundreds of nice pictures with it. I won't go over the things already mentioned on other reviews, but I would like to post a video taken with the actual camera. The video capabilities is not really covered by most of the reviews. I can tell you it is acceptable, not fantastic, but good enough for a Youtube. However, it has no stablilization while doing video (I really wouldn't have expected it to)and my footage suffered with my constant movement.

She wanted a camera that was easy to use and took good pictures. I on the other hand, wanted a little more out of the camera. I looked at several and came up with this one. I like several features including the batteries you can dump and reload on the go. Don't have to plug in and charge. Battery life is good too, better if you use Energizer e2's (No Plug, Just Fact!). I also like the Optical zoom, have not seen a lot of cameras this size have a good optical zoom, just digital. Features take some playing with to get used to but what new device doesn't. Bottom line is that my wife can put it on AUTO and shoot nice pictures, and I can change all the settings on PROGRAM mode and do the same. The only down side I can think of is that it IS SMALLER than the one I previously had, so it will take some adjusting for the size factor. I definitely use the wrist strap all the time. All in all, it's a very nice camera, I was even thinking about getting one for myself because my wife wants hers back!Update: I liked this camera and probably would still be using it if my curious little 3 year old didn't find it and decide that the lens should be pushed in when the motor pushed it out.

I was also looking forward to this model because Canon reduced the size, and for me, the smaller and lighter, the better.Unfortunately, Canon needs to go back to the drawing board.The camera is oddly shaped...shaped like a wedge. I dislike this wedge shape. The picture on Amazon doesn't show the wedge shape. You have to be looking down on the top or the bottom to see it.I don't really like the way the camera feels while holding it. It's not as good as some of the other A Series. The camera also feels heavier than I thought it would feel, based on the description. I expected the camera to be lighter in weight and easier to carry in my pocket.I am disappointed with the flash recharge time between shots. There is a good chance you will miss an important shot occasionally while waiting for the flash to recharge.The zoom while shooting video with this camera is digital zoom, and the results are poor. If you use the zoom, you won't be able to read words or see some things clearly. I recommend not using the zoom when recording video.Digital still pictures are the same quality you expect with this type of Canon Point & Shoot Camera, as long as you shoot at the low ISO. Once you try to shoot in low light or at a higher ISO, the typical noise level is there. I was hoping that Canon would have improved their image sensor on their $250 cameras by now, but they have not.The 6X Optical Zoom while shooting still pictures is great.Macro mode for very close up shots is great.The 3\" LCD screen is very nice and clear (unless you are outside in bright sunlight, of course).Conclusion: If you really desire a camera that accepts alkaline batteries, put the A2000 IS on your list. If the battery issue is not important to you, I would avoid this camera. In my opinion, if Canon or any other company releases a better camera that takes alkaline batteries, you will dump this camera in a second. (I know I will.) I guess this means that this can be your temporary AA-battery-operated camera until something better comes along.

By and far, it's not perfect, but what digital camera really is?There's a complaint about the wedge shape, but the camera is far smaller than the previous A series, which has an even more unusual shape that makes it bulky and very difficult to fit in most compact digital camera bags (which for the A2000 is a TON easier, not to mention easier to fit in a pocket).  I'd take smaller and unusual but sleeker over larger, bulky, and awkward.Another complaint was the flash recycle time; what do you expect with AA batteries?  When the A series used 4 AA batteries, I'm sure this wasn't as much of an issue, but the camera was ridiculously huge and heavy.  If you want smaller recycle times, go buy a camera with Lithium-Ion batteries.  The A2000 had at worst a little longer recycle time than the A720, but I've learned to live with it; I have to be a little more careful with my shots rather than just shooting away as if I had a SLR.With that professional reviewer, I think he's being a bit nitpicky.  I had no problems with the dial, as I use all the settings, including the manual modes very often.  Unless you want perfection...well, let's be honest, if you want a monster camera, you should be looking for a SLR.The short of it: I love my A720IS, but the size is a huge burden. If you can live with the longer flash recycle times than the SD series (which I've gotten used to, I'm sure you can too), and can take care of your camera (I don't recommend this for a teenager that'll slap this around) this is really a great camera for the price.", "Date": "December 28, 2008"}, {"Title": "Go for it", "Author": "Audrey A.

Lawless", "ReviewID": "RIVFS78W2T3IR", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I am very sorry I bought the new Canon A2000 camera. I will be giving the camera to my nephew, since my disappointment is so high. I cannot express my frustration level at the amount of time it takes for the flash to recharge and at Canon for even bothering to release such an inferior \"A\" series replacement. I implore upon Canon to go back to the drawing board on this one.I read all of the reviews on Amazon and I have to respond directly to that one review where the reviewer foolishly tries to justify his positive review based on the review of a camera-review Website.One other reviewer responded in the comments section to said review, but his or her reply won't be seen in the general review section, so I will paste in what he or she said here.(These are excerpts from a professional camera reviewer.)\"The A2000 is a bit of a new departure for the A-series. Previous models in the range have been popular with hobbyists and more experienced photographers, thanks to their robust construction, excellent handling, limited but useful range of manual exposure controls and optical viewfinders. The A2000 has none of these things, and appears to be aimed at less ambitious photographers looking not for manual versatility but for a simple, easy-to-use general-purpose compact. If this represents a new direction for the A-series then there will be some disappointed customers.\"The body is made of plastic, and although the camera does feel solidly weighty, the body panels seem to be thinner than previous A-series cameras and creak alarmingly when squeezed. There's nothing really wrong with it, but it does feel more cheaply made than some previous models in the range.\"The A2000 has no optical viewfinder, but it does have an enormous three-inch LCD monitor. However this too is not up to the high standard of previous A-series models. It has an extremely narrow viewing angle of only about 30-odd degrees vertically, making it difficult to use for over-the-head shots, and it is also highly reflective. It's the first Canon monitor in a long time that I've actually had difficulty using outdoors.\"Main shooting mode is controlled via a large dial on the camera's top panel. The dial itself feels a bit cheap and clunky, with distinct air of Fisher Price about it.\"The menu on the A2000 appears to be similar to some of the recent IXUS range, with fewer options than usual for an A-series camera.\"The external controls don't appear to be as solidly mounted as they might be, and some feel decidedly flimsy. Catch one with the edge of a fingernail and it gives an distinctly plastic `ping'.\"The zoom control is a rotary bezel around the shutter button. The control action is fairly crude; you have to turn the ring a long way to make it move, and when it does it moves jerkily and too quickly, making accurate framing difficult. Since the 6x zoom range is a major selling point of the camera I would have hoped that Canon might do a better job on the zoom control.\"Low light focusing is not as reliable as some other recent cameras.\"VerdictThe Canon PowerShot A2000 IS is a little expensive for a mid-level compact, and the overall build quality and low-angle monitor may cause some disappointment. The lack of the usual A-series manual exposure options and optical viewfinder may also put off some potential buyers.\"Yes, the review listed many positives, but with so many negatives, you can clearly see why many people would give this camera some low star ratings. Also, the low star reviews are a reflection of the huge disappointment with Canon regarding their latest A model. They could have and should have done better. They are charging $250, and it is 2008, and the flash recharge time is unacceptable. Also, when considering reviews, you have to take into consideration that one might be trying to help people decide if there are better cameras if one doesn't really care about the AA battery issue.\"I think the A2000 deserves the majority of low star ratings it has on Amazon as of today. Thank you.\"I agree with the above negatives and opinion. And I would concur that the A2000 deserves a lower star rating because the scale is different with this camera. The rating is on this latest \"A\" series replacement camera from Canon; a camera line that takes AA batteries.", "Date": "October 1, 2008"}, {"Title": "Great Camera!", "Author": "Lynn Brown \"tombstoneguru\"", "ReviewID": "R3RR7QU07RI5M1", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Have only had this camera for a short period but it takes super clear pictures on the auto setting.

Well over half were so blurry that they were worthless.  It was a once-in-a-lifetime trip which I will never be able to repeat.  Pictures taken in bright sunlight or with flash are good, but no better than any other digital camera.  There is no viewfinder so the only way to view the picture before taking it is the display on the back.  In bright sunlight it is impossible to see the image on the display.

Most cameras are only 3-4x Optical Zoom.CONS:#1 CON - LONG delay between pictures.  This may mean you miss a pic or two at times....eek!- Some smaller cameras out there...if that's what you're looking for.- Using the screen all the time means it's using your batteries quicker (vs. a viewfinder on other cameras)- Uses 2 AA batteries???...personally this doesn't bother me because I don't have to worry about every buying one of those expensive batteries that come with most other point and shoot cameras down the road.  I just bought 4 rechargables and now I'll have battery backups all the time and for A LOT less than the cost of the other batteries.BOTTOM LINE: Go to the store and take a picture or two with the camera.

I did two weeks worth of research and finally decided on this one, largely because I trust the Canon brand.I read several negative reviews on this camera and decided to ignore them, since the A1000 gets better reviews and this is supposedly a step up.

I've always found my A75 to be on the large size, so I didn't care that much about having an ultra-compact camera, but I was not expecting it to actually be bigger.Also discovered that the flash recharge takes longer than my A75, I'm guessing because it takes two batteries instead of four.  I was also expecting a huge improvement in image stabilization and motion detection since I bought the A75 four years ago, but I still got blurry pictures of my cat indoors with no flash (she's white so flash always washes her out) but with plenty of light and set to \"Kids and pets.\"  Maybe I'm just running up against the limits of a digital point and shoot, but I thought the technology would have improved more by now.Sent it back and decided to wait for the new Lumix DMC-FS15 that's coming out at the end of the month.

Was very happy with it at first but lately it seems the pic quality isn't as good.  No matter what setting I use, pictures tend to look \"flashed out\" - not sure if this is some sort of light leak or - ?  The lag time between taking pics is the biggest drawback to this camera. VERY slow for sure. With regard to batteries, I use AA lithium and they last a very long time, so there's really no need for rechargeable.  I took pictures and video non-stop for 2 weeks on a trip to Ireland and never had to replace the batteries.This is my 3rd Canon camera. Seems to me that quality has gone FAR downhill and they have a lot of the same issues across the board - for example, as many people have complained on various models, I also had to return one of my Canonse because the lens wouldn't retract after several weeks of use.

Bummer.", "Date": "February 21, 2012"}, {"Title": "This is the best camera I've owned and it takes amazing pictures!", "Author": "karmawizard", "ReviewID": "R30FLUBNNSH62N", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Before purchasing this item on Amazon, I owned a Sony Cypershot that I had for years, and I just figured it was time to get a new camera to take advantage of advancing technology. I'm so very glad I made the decision to purchase this camera. Although it is relatively inexpensive, it has taken some of the most beautiful pictures of any camera I've ever used, and it surpasses the picture quality of friends' cameras that cost substantially more money.One of the best things about this camera, in my opinion, is that unlike many cameras, it runs on two AA batteries. The downside to this is that there is a bit of a lag when taking pictures while the flash recharges, and it takes a few seconds to navigage between pictures on the camera in the picture-viewing mode. However, this also means that if your battery runs low, throw them out and put in a couple of AA's, which can be gotten without very much trouble almost anywhere. Whereas many cameras have a special type of battery that, when it dies, unless you have a spare ready, so much for your pictures. Granted, these other batteries may last longer and speed up flash recovery time, but you may miss out on pictures if your battery goes dead. With this one, just carry a couple extra AA's, which are cheap and available.Some reviewers said that they experienced problems with the lens not opening or sticking, or with the battery door being flimsy. Well, I've had this camera and have probably taken several hundred pictures with it over the last couple years. So far the lens has never stuck or failed to open. So perhaps they got a faulty model, but mine works wonderfully. As far as the battery door being flimsy plastic, I grant you that it's not the toughest plastic in the world, and if you drop it or abuse it and aren't careful, it may end up braking on you. So, just be careful with it, and you won't have any problem. Anything you use and abuse is breakable; under normal conditions you'll be fine.The only cons to this camera that I've found are as follows: At times the autofocus focuses on objects that I don't want to be the focus of the picture, and I have to test the focus a couple times to get a particular shot to work out. But, after having used several autofocus cameras, I suspect this is common to just about all digital, autofocus units out there. Also, it's quite possible that I have something set incorrectly on the camera itself and that could be causing some of the problem. This camera allows you the ability to change many settings to achieve almost any effect you could want. However the instruction manual does leave a bit to be desired (don't they all), so you have to play around with this to see what it can do.As some people have noted, because it runs on AA batteries instead of a lithium or other battery type, recovery time for the flash is longer, and often takes several seconds. So, if you're someone who tends to take a lot of high-speed, action shots where every second counts and a delay is liable to cost you the perfect shot, then this camera might not be for you, and you may wish to invest in something more pricey or something that uses a different kind of battery. If, however, you want something that will take fantastically clear and vivid pictures of people, objects, and anything else ordinary you can think of and that's ready to go right out of the box in a hurry, this camera is for you. Basically you have to weigh the pros and cons of being able to use easily obtainable disposable batteries versus the loss of speed involved when using such batteries, and compare this to your needs. In my opinion, this is one of the best cameras you will find anywhere in this price range, it takes incredible pictures on the fly, and has a lot of extra, advanced settings too boot. If you're planning to be a professional photographer and use a camera for business, there are probably better models out there; alternatively, if you just need a camera to capture quality moments in your life as they unfold, this is the one for you. Don't think twice about getting this, because it's fantastic.The only recommendation I have is that you buy a separate memory card for this camera, 4GB or better capacity. The card that comes with the camera holds only a few pictures, and isn't very useful for storage if you're going to take more than six photos at a time. With a 4GB memory card, I believe the camera will hold about 700 pictures at ultra high res, (which is about 4MB/picture) or about 1,500 photos at the fine setting, which is about 3mb/picture.", "Date": "June 1, 2011"}, {"Title": "Old but perferred!", "Author": "Super Sarah", "ReviewID": "R3CYFW1YME6E3L", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I got this camera for a birthday present a few years ago.

I bought this after a lot of research. I wanted a smaller camera because I just didn't want to lug my sx10is around all the time. What I wanted was good picture quality. This little camera is a gem. I am absolutely impressed with how good the pictures really are. It's a point and shoot with point and shoot limitations. Sure, it's missing manual controls but, I really don't care. I just wanted simplicity, a smaller & lighter camera that takes decent pictures. I got everything I was looking for. When using flash, it is slow for the next picture but, that's not unusual in cameras like these. I ran into the same situation when I used point and shoot film cameras. So, this was no surprise to me, and it's acceptable for me. The video should not be zoomed as digital zoom just plain stinks. The colors are more saturated in this camera I notice. The contrast is bumped up a notch higher too. In bright sunny days, I like that. I haven't done much in dimmer lighting yet, so I'm curious as to how those colors may act since saturation is up. If I see a problem, I can always switch to the program mode, then switch \"my colors\" to \"Neutral.\" That should calm over saturation down. I'll have to wait and see. I always set the focus to center. That seems to work the best for me. I do the same with my sx10. I'm not impressed with face detection. What I can't seem to see any differences is in the auto vs. easy mode. I even put my bifocals back on. Does anyone see any difference between the \"easy\" and \"auto\" mode?

On Auto Mode, the flash takes FOREVER to charge back up, but I have found that switching to the nifty Easy Mode makes it charge faster. Also, I have heard that this camera eats alkaline batteries up pretty quick, so I prepared for that by purchasing some extra rechargeables.

The overall smaller size of the new camera verses the old is ok I guess.  I kinda of miss the right hand gripping feature a little.  Other than that I couldn't be more happy about it.  Some people have said that the lag between each picture is long but I don't see much of a problem with it.  Maybe try replacing batteries (I use rechargeable) and moving down the picture view time to 2 secs.

This camera has a really nice set up like all the rest of the A Series. I had problems with two things. The first being the amount of time between pictures. When I took a picture the screen would show the picture you took (I had it set on 2 sec reveal) and then the screen would go black until the next picture could be taken (took quit a few seconds to clear). This was very annoying especially with a fast pet. I thought it might be the type of SD card but it wasn't. I tried 2 different kinds, the SanDisk SDHC Card and the SanDisk Extreme III SDHC Card. The Extreme III did not help the in between shots get any faster on this camera. Now the camera takes great pictures and has a really easy set up so if the time between shots doesn't bother you then this may be a good camera for you. The second problem I had was the LCD screen was fuzzy when there wasn't a lot of light in the room. The minute you went into a room with a lot of lights on the screen cleared up. I think this may have been a defect with the camera I got, but I am not completely sure that other A2000IS cameras do not do this. The picture would take normal it was just a fuzzy screen while trying to take a picture. That made it harder to see if everyone was smiling at the same time. I gave this camera 3 stars because I think it can be a good camera. I was just expecting more for the price and for it being a Canon. The whole reason for buying this camera was to upgrade from a Canon A 95. I wanted to get a faster time between shots and a larger LCD screen to view pictures on. This camera ended up being a downgrade from our old camera.

Why? Digital photographic knowledge combined with technical skills. I coupled my A2000IS with a SanDisk Extreme III 4GB memory card and two Sony Ni-MH Rechargeable batteries; applied my digital photographic technical skills and the results were stunning shots. The card and batteries work together for quick results. The card will shoot 905 photos at 10Mega pixels or hold an hour of video. The batteries make all functions Daytona speed spectacles.Macro shots are explicitly clear as are the zoom shots. Even the zoom in movie mode remains clean and crisp while shooting. I took three spectacular one minute movies through Plexiglas while at the Monterey Bay Aquarium last week. The penguins and jellyfish look as if I were in clear underwater with them.All the function buttons are definitive and easy to use. I especially like the preview button. The scene modes on top of the A2000 prove effective, as does the wedge shape. It's quite unique and regal looking. I have no problem holding the camera securely without a rubber grip on the front.I like this Canon Powershot A2000IS so much I'll be purchasing the new Canon SX1 IS in April when it's released in the US market.

Poor quality, very slow response, just an all around poor performer.I purchased this based on Canon's reputation, my experience with my Canon DSLR and reviews I read here and other sites.  Maybe I just got a \"lemon\", but the picture quality was poorer than that of an OLD nikon point and shoot I had, with only 3 MP resolution.  Low Light?  FORGET IT!  Any kind of speed in capturing the moment?  Not likely.I would recommend buying a slightly higher priced camera, maybe it it the old processor in this model, or maybe, as I said, I just got a \"lemon\">  All I know is that all the pictures I tried to take on a recent \"once-in-a-lifetime\" trip came out poor or un-viewable.  Ruined.  And I thought that video would be a great added feature?  Nope.  Very slow, poor quality and slow response.  Only digital zoom as well, and the digital zoom is AWFUL!Save your pennies and don't waste them on this model!", "Date": "June 30, 2009"}, {"Title": "Expect ot pay more", "Author": "R.
