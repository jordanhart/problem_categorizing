I'm using on the ends of my Siamese cable run. It gives a nice clean custom look. I like that I can use the thicker 18 ga. wire for my cameras.Follow-up:One Note though, After using a new batch I noticed the polarity is reversed. Also had a couple of defective ones that would short my power supply box. Took me some time to figure it out. I would verify with a multimeter before installing. In all I'm still very pleased. All my cameras are working! Knocked one star off!", "Date": "September 25, 2011"}, {"Title": "Caution The Positive and Negative Markings Are Wrong", "Author": "C. Boyd", "ReviewID": "R12GB6EEEHL6HD", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "I ordered these connectors to use on a CCTV system. The screws were marked with positive and negative markings. On most low voltage devices the center pin is positive. I assumed that the positive was the center pin and hooked up the wiring that way. After completing the wiring I found that the markings were inconsistent. Some were marked with the center pin as positive and others were the other way around. It took me some time to figure out why I was getting voltage on the shield of the coax and the cameras were not working. If you buy these just keep in mind the + and - mean nothing. They worked great after figuring that out. I would buy them again but I would test them before I installed them.", "Date": "April 12, 2012"}, {"Title": "Good product", "Author": "440bx", "ReviewID": "R138S8OSLWM1CB", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "These connectors are substantially better than using pigtails.  The connection they make with the female end is adequate but, I wish it were just a tad tighter (which is possible and is the reason why I did not give the product 5 stars.)Securing the cable ends is easy and they are truly secured in the connector.  The connectors are clearly labelled for positive and negative.I've used over a dozen of them so far and each one has worked flawlessly.
