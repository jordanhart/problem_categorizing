{"Reviews": [{"Title": "SX20 IS Great Hybrid Camera For Video And Stills", "Author": "B. Massey \"massmanjr\"", "ReviewID": "R38OC2CCCTJWE5", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Let me start off by saying that I'm not a professional photographer.  My decision to purchase the SX20 IS was based on a desire to get an excellent still shot camera, with high capacity zoom, that also had HD Video (720p) capabilities.  So, I began my research and spent many hours scouring the web to make an informed decision.  I had narrowed my choice to the Canon SX20 IS and the Panasonic DMC-FZ35.Here are some of the key specs of each camera:Optical Zoom (Canon: 20, Pana: 18)Still image files (Canon: Not Raw, Pana: Raw)Articulating LCD (Canon: Yes, Pana: No)720p HD video per 2 GB (Canon: 10 min 33 sec, Pana: 15 min)Video file format (Canon: .mov, Pana: AVCHD Lite)Battery Type: (Canon: 4 AA, Pana: Li-ion rechargeable)Stereo Audio (Both)SD Card Storage (Both)[...].In the end I decided to go with Canon for a few key reasons:#1. The articulating LCD (pull out, tilt/move) was a key factor, as I wanted to be able to shoot from many different angles.  It came in handy very soon--the second time I used the camera--I was able to whip out the LCD and get some decent shots at a football game when I had to raise the camera high over my head to shoot over the folks standing in front of me.#2. The ability to easily share video files.  The .mov file format is a more widely accepted format, which can easily be shared (without processing/conversion).  The files are accepted on sites such as You Tube. The files can be played with Quicktime and other media players (e.g. VLC).  Although the Panasonic camera uses a format which is more compressed and allows more data to be stored on an SD card, the file format is not as wide spread and not as easy to share with others, without converting the file.#3. Consumer Reports rankings for last year's model: Canon #1, Pana #5 (SX10 IS & Pana DMC-FZ28). I suspect the SX20 IS will follow the same trend this year when Consumer Reports releases their test results for 2009.#4. Canon takes AA batteries.  This makes the camera slightly heavier, but you'll always be able to get economical batteries in a pinch, without the need for buying a proprietary lithium ion battery.  May I recommend Sanyo Eneloop rechargeable batteries. I bought some new on Amazon. They are excellent. I haven't charged them yet and I've taken 120 pictures and 40 minutes plus of 720p video. I've also played back the pictures and movies on my TV/Projector and transferred all files to my computer, using the same batteries, without charging them.  And they are \"..still going...\"Here are some sample pictures taken with the SX20 IS.  Keep in mind that Flickr doesn't display the full, original picture which was taken in maximum resolution (in auto mode). [...].I've taken some great up-close family shots and macro shots.  They look great and are very detailed. I took some night/action pics (with the flash) and adjusted the shutter speed and ISO settings and the pictures looked great, given the conditions.[...].I apologize for the camera jitter in advance as I didn't have a tri-pod and I was in a tight area in the Stadium when I took the shots.I must admit that I am thoroughly impressed with the video quality/resolution.  I shot sample video from my 1 year old camcorder (Panasonic SDR-H40, a standard definition hard drive camcorder) and shot the same footage with the SX20 IS. The difference in quality was amazing.  Not only was the Canon much sharper, but the richness and vibrance of the colors was so much better. I sold my SDR-H40 on Ebay within two days.  I now will have only one camera to shoot stills and 720p HD video--the Canon SX20 IS. The videos from the SX20 IS looked awesome--on both my 32 inch 720p LCD and my 100+ inch screen via a 720p DLP projector. I connected the camera with an HDMI cable and bam, I was ready to watch great video and view still shots \"on the big screen.\"  See the above referenced links for video footage yourself.  If I were given the opportunity to watch a football game shot in standard definition by ESPN or an HD version of the same game, shot with the SX20 IS (on a tripod, without my hand jitter), I'd pick the latter in a heart beat.No buyer's remorse here!  If you are looking for an SLR type camera, that does awesome stills and great 720p HD video (both zoomable at 20x optical), you'd be hard pressed to get more bang for your buck then the SX20 IS on Amazon.One minor issue I've noticed is that when zooming in/out while shooting video, you can here a slight \"click\" when you initiate the zoom and when you stop the zoom.  There is NO noise heard while the lens is zooming/telescoping in/out; the \"click\" is only heard when the zoom is initiated and when the zoom is stopped.  The \"click\" is not that noticeable. I had to shoot footage in silence, after the kids had gone to bed, in order to distinguish the \"click.\"  In most shooting environments I don't expect it to be much of an issue.Best of luck with your purchase decision.P.S.  By the way, the owner manual states that you must use the Canon software to transfer images/movies from the camera to a PC, else movies will not transfer (frames will be dropped) correctly and images shot vertically may be transferred in the horizontal orientation. So, don't just do a copy/paste of the files them self from the SD card.  Keep this in mind as you view sample video on the web.", "Date": "September 6, 2009"}, {"Title": "I bought the SX20 because I had good luck with the SX10", "Author": "Kirk Tuck \"Kirk Tuck\"", "ReviewID": "RIA1M761PDONW", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I shoot all kinds of stuff with all kinds of cameras.  I am a working photographer who shoots for advertising and corporate client as well as to make images for my own books about photography.  Over the last two years I've been using small cameras like the Canon G10 and the SX10 for more and more of my work.  In the studio, shooting set up shots or small products these cameras shine by dint of their easy to use Live View and increased depth of field.  When I bought the SX 10 it was for the long range of the zoom lens which meant I could shoot anything from a construction site to tight shots of the cabins at the top of the construction cranes.  I've done some portraits with studio lights and an SX10 and they were also very usable.  I wish the SX 10 and SX 20 had raw file capability but they don't.  That just means I have to be a bit more careful about WB and exposure.  I've used the SX10 at outdoor swim meets and found that the lens performs better than expected right out to the end.So, why the SX 20?  Recently I've been asked to do more and more little video snippets for clients and for my publisher and while I like the results from the SX10 I wanted real HD video for the times that a medical practice has asked for video clips for both their website AND for power point and other uses.  I wanted the extra detail for the times that they use the clips in projected presentations.  The price point works.I've spent a couple days testing the SX 10 and the results are very, very good.  The front mounted microphones are of very high quality and the sound for most applications is very acceptable.  Would I like a mike input?  You bet!  Does that sour the deal?  Not in the least.The image quality of the stills is just as good as the SX 10 at low ISO's and about 1/2 a stop better at 200 and 400.  I'll chalk that up to the new digic processor.All in all the build quality and the easy operation make the camera a winner for me.  These days clients are more interested in using images and video in a wide range of multimedia and the  SX 20 is a great tool for anything that's headed to the web.  I still own traditional DLSR cameras and use them but left to my own devices I find the smaller sensor cameras to be highly competent and very usable.With an SX20 and a G10 I feel like I can handle just about anything except shots that call for narrow depth of field.  Traditional photographers may not want to hear that video is becoming a required skill but that won't make it go away.  This camera is a cost effective way to get your feet wet, find your way around and get your feet wet.  I like it.", "Date": "September 4, 2009"}, {"Title": "I Like this Camera", "Author": "B. Craig \"photo hobbyist\"", "ReviewID": "R1O9B4P51Y262D", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Years ago I carried and VHS video camera with separate recorder as well as an SLR.  Even after video went to the 8mm tape and camera were much smaller I gave up the video and concentrated on stills.  I went through the 640 x 480 digital cameras and found the images horrible, digital would never replace film.  I've since packed away my film cameras and concentrated on DSLRs.  I carry a pocket digital camera for convenince but turn to the DSLR when I plan on taking photos.Recently I was viewing photos taken by a friend on his SX10 IS.  I was intrigued by the features, the quality of the photos, and the video capability.  When I went to Amazon.com to check on the price of this camera I saw the SX20 IS slated for release.  After viewing the features I decided to wait for this camera.  I'm glad I did.I received this camera on the day I left for a trip to Walt Disney World.  While I took the DSLR with me I thought this would be a great opportunity to learn about the SX20 IS.  Since I have many Disney World photos I left the DSLR behind most of the time and carried just the SX20 IS.Recently I took photos with the SX20 IS and my Canon XSi DSLR and compared the photos side by side.  The results were consistent with the reviews I've read.In bright daylight the photos are comparable.  As the lighting deteriorates the XS20 IS tends to show more noise.  It's not unacceptable to me, just not as good.  Also, the DSLR focuses more quickly and accurately most of the time.  However, to get the focal length on the lens I'd have to carry more equipment for the DSLR and I still wouldn't be able to take video.I'm not a video expert but I think the quality on this camera is excellent.  It is much sharper than that footage from my old video cameras.  Being able to use the zoom while shooting is great.  Being able to snap a still while shooting the video is also a big plus in my opinion.The articulating LCD really proved beneficial.  When behind a crowd or in a tight situation it's nice to be able to move the camera and still be able to compose the shot without guessing.  It's also helpful when just trying to change a perspective on a subject without having to stnad on something or lie on the ground.  Self-portraits are also easier, just make sure you look at the camera, not the LCD, when you finally push the shutter.Will this camera replace my DSLR?  Not for situations where I consider the quality of the photo or quick focus critical.  However, for situations where I just want to enjoy an outing without carrying an entire camera bag this is a great choice.  The still photo remains my preference but I can see me shooting video much more frequently.  Now all I need is some extra batteries (the NiMH variety seem to work fine) and spare SD cards.  The external flash from the DSLR works on the SX20 IS and helps the noise issue.  However, I usually leave it behind to cut down on the bulk.I got what I expected with this camera.  As I learn more about its different functions I'm sure I'll appreciate it more.One piece of advice.  When storing the camera or carrying it in a backpack, etc. use the articulating feature to face the LCD toward the camera body.  It protects the LCD screen.  I was in sich a hurry to use the camera I forgot to do this and now have a minor scratch on the LCD, a situation I could have avoided.", "Date": "October 5, 2009"}, {"Title": "More pixels don't always mean better images ...", "Author": "S. Hock \"slhimages\"", "ReviewID": "R3ABFR43REP2QQ", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I too am a working photographer. I grew weary of dragging that heavy gadget bag on vacations so I purchased the SX10is a year ago. What a joy to use! All that focal length at your fingertips! The image quality was also fine for pro use.As time went on, I needed HD video for a client. It was a clear choice for me to purchase the SX20is for the purpose. Why learn yet another camera? And wow, a even better SX10? Well, not quite.I won't rehash all that Kirk Tuck and others have said before me. I will say though ... don't upgrade from the SX10is for the 2 megapixels. If you are interested in mainly still images, STICK WITH THE SX10. The rest of the camera is very similar. The new menus are more colorful, controls are marginally different in the menus and all else is pretty much the same. Most of the changes are \"fluff\". If you don't NEED the HD video I would NOT switch. To me, the SX10 delivers a noticeably snappier still image.What I like about the SX camera series:1. That fabulous zoom lens! To have all that zoom in such a small package. Sweet!2. Uses AA batteries. You'll never run out of power. Available everywhere.3. Thoughtful design & shape and feeling of solid quality.4. Excellent eyepiece diopter adjustment (at least for me)5. SD card access door is separate from all other access panels. Real easy to get to,even while on a tripod.5. Metal tripod mount6. Reasonable price for all the features included.7. Oh yeah .. the swiveling LCD screen too. Very useful!8. The fact you also get nice HD video in one package is a bonus.What I'm not so crazy about:1. Buttons or right rear a bit crowded. Sometimes I press something I don't want.2. No filter threads ...geez Canon, come on ....3. Battery indicator is not on all the time4. Wish I could \"customize\" the \"AUTO\" function5. Manual as PDF (what a pain). I'll take mine paper, thank you.You might as well print it out right away. You're gonna need it!6. Selection of \"spot\" meter defaults back to \"center\" at power down.7. Electronic ViewFinder (Not just this one either. They all leave me wanting.)8. Somewhat less crisp still images compared to the SX10 that I also own.A fine RGB file at 4000 x 3000 yields a 34 MB file in Photoshop! Oddly, more pixels don't translate into better image quality. SX20is images don't have quite the \"snap\" to my eye as the SX10.Is it perfect? Heck no. Are any of them? Even the $5,000 ones?Perhaps if Canon changed the firmware to include \"Superfine\" compression, this camera could then become a stellar performer??Do I miss RAW mode? Not really. If you need it buy a DSLR.What do I miss most when switching from my NIKON? That bright, super clear viewfinder.Will it clip highlights? Sure, if you don't set it up right. So does the SX10is (and my Nikon). High dynamic range is not usually a feature on most consumer cameras.Pros take note... I was on the fence as to whether this cameras image quality is good enough to satisfy my professional needs. If you are obsessed with tack sharp images, pass on this one. You probably won't be happy. If \"good\" is good enough, go for it.After shooting and experimenting for 10 days I wasn't happy. The still images were just too darn soft. What a pity. This potentially GREAT camera hamstrung by a mediocre sensor. It appears to me the the sensor size was adjusted to accommodate the Hi Def video at the sacrifice of still image quality. I expected more from 12 megapixels and didn't get it. I had to return it.Don't get me wrong, it's a very good still camera ... just not a great one. If video is your main interest and your still picture needs are secondary, you'll probably like it.[...].Note that YouTube Reduces file size to increase playability over the internet so what you see is only fraction of the video detailNewbies purchasing this ... make no mistake, this is a complex little piece of gear. Sure, you can use it on AUTO if you want, but what a waste. You have to LEARN this camera to get the most out of it. And don't expect to learn it in a day or even a week. Used properly it will yield beautiful ( if not super sharp) images. Buy it and shoot, shoot, shoot and you'll get the hang of it. Why not? The \"film\" is cheap!By the way, purchase a Class 6 SD card right away. That way if you want to play with the HD movie function you can. Some cheap SD cards can't write fast enough for HD video use. If you have a hi def TV you'll love it.Beware though, HD video files get HUGE fast! Uploads to YouTube (or anywhere else) can take quite awhile. A 1 minute, 36 sec. clip equals 491 MB and over 4 hrs to upload via DSL.If you get serious about HD video, or enjoy doing critical focus photography, PLEASE, buy a decent tripod and USE it.", "Date": "September 28, 2009"}, {"Title": "Best out there shy of an SLR", "Author": "pax lingua", "ReviewID": "R14BCB580L8RWX", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I reviewed the PowerShot SX200 IS a short while ago on Canon's and Amazon's website and rated it very highly.  Nonetheless, I decided to return it in exchange for the PowerShot SX20 IS.This camera offers the following additional advantages: a viewfinder; HD video recording with optical zoom throughout the zoom range plus stereo sound; a form factor much more like that of an SLR: it is on the heavy side, but easy to hold and the viewfinder allows you to hold the camera against your body which adds extra stability, and thus better focus, especially when zooming in;  diapter adjustability means I don't have to wear glasses when using the EVF; the LCD display can be closed so it faces the camera - no need to worry about smudging or scratching it.Those who are considering the purchase of an SLR need to keep in mind that you'll need at least three different lenses to get a comparable zoom range.  You'd be lugging around quite a bit of weight, and faced with the delay in changing lenses depending upon what you want to take a picture of.Some question the quality of the pictures it takes.  Keep in mind that this is not a camera designed for amateurs who insist on fully automatic features. In other words, the best possible pictures may only be obtained when you make needed adjustments ranging from setting the scene yourself to fully manual ones, or else by using a photo editor.So far, I have taken perhaps one hundred test pictures and ten minutes of video.  Unless you intend to print or view the pictures beyond 11\" x 14\", I doubt that you will notice any difference between the results this camera produces and an SLR.  I've owned the Olympus e-510, and can say that you'd have to magnify or crop to a degree that most users simply don't in order to notice a difference.  The quality of the videos is much better than that of my standard definition Canon DC230 mini-DVD camera.  The downside is the weight of this camera, which makes extended filming somewhat difficult (for me, at least).I highly recommend the camera for those who are looking for the characteristics I have highlighted. It is probably one of the best, if not the best, super-zooms on the market today.", "Date": "September 19, 2009"}, {"Title": "Unbiased review", "Author": "Objective analysis", "ReviewID": "R2LFK2ELFRN7TR", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "Pros:1) features2) Super macro worked up to 2 inches in average light3) ISO 100-32004) Aquarium anti reflection mode...worth trying for glass cases in museums.5) Decent movies and easy to use and work6) Good long range telephoto...not great but usable without carrying extra lens.7) image quality average8) tricky menus until understood and then works well...in viewfinder is nice...fast menu display.9) Many options but are laid out well, dont clutter each other up...rotate selection works fast and well for P mode. AEB works fine but is slow. ISO 3200 works really well but as one would expect has noise, but the images are usable if you like to Photoshop your images...marginally acceptable but better than nothing if you cant use a flash or carry a tripod to art museums or Cathedrals10) Zoom and digital zoom....the ability to have that compact zoom range, is better than having to lug around a lot of gear for the casual person...this is a people camera, not a photographers camera...this is not an SLR,$600 dollar lens, raw image camera, so dont have that expectation.Cons:1) Canon tightwads do not include a detailed robust manual like previous cameras, what do they expect you to do, download and print it out...or carry a laptop.This is fairly stupid on Canons part, they could have at least created a one page cheat sheet like there is for the SX10 from third parties.2) Unless you have hard surfaces and a lot of light, this camera has some serious focus issues in Auto mode....SCN mode seems to be ok and so are movies, but auto mode is misrable.....this is not a low light camera unless you have rock stable hands, the image stabilize does not seem to be that good, unless there is light.G10 was an easier camera to use, but did not have the focal length. No problems with Macro that worked well and so did super Macro. The indoor setting was average but worked.3) Jpg vs raw....this is a jpg camera, and what you get is average jpg images, so lower your expectation if you are looking for a wonderful jpg or really need the detail and color or raw.4) Camera is ok sizewise but has an awkward balance, kind of stubby in the width, it is accetable but the camera does not balance well, a little tight and cramped, this is not a showstopper the advantages outweigh the disadvantages.Believe what you read in all the reviews, when it takes a good picture it is really nice, but when it is bad it is really bad, seems to be the usually Canon issue, Canons like bright light....if that isnt there, they get noise.You will really need to experiment with the focus options, and since cheap Canon, not unlike AGI, Enron, and other companies out to stab the consumer does not provide a decent portable manual, you will need to experiment, and spend time on your laptop to review the documentation.....having to have a laptop to study a portable camera...kind of perverted for a camera company to do this.All in all it is an ok, Swiss army knife kind of camera, and if you can get into the \"does it all, but doesnt do it all .....really great\" Then you will be ok.I dont think I will send it back yet, need to experiment a little more.Do not think that the reviews about bad images are false, for a camera that has an auto mode, the images just are not that great for \"AUTO\". This camera does have some focus quirks.In general so far the good and bad are balanced, it is a picture takers camera, not a photographers camera...this is the keep it simple and provide a lot tourist travel camera", "Date": "September 16, 2009"}, {"Title": "Use The Foilage Setting For Best Color Pics", "Author": "T. Baker", "ReviewID": "R212GC62A6BDUF", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I received the camera a few days ago. I wanted a good quality camera for all-around, basic shooting. The main features that attracted me were the wide angle/zoom lens and the video option.I am not an expert, or even an experienced amateur. I just want to be able to point, shoot, and take decent pics and some occassional vidoe.In my opinion, the best eye-pleasing pictures are those that show the vibrant colors and color variations - all other things being equal. I've experimented with various settings and taken the same shots with those various settings, and compared shots taken with Auto, Landscape, Portrait, etc. against the Foilage setting [SCN/Foilage], and the Foilage setting is by far the best for bringing out the colors (which it is meant to do anyway). Compared to those pics taken using the Foilage setting, the ones taken in the other settings are dull - not that they aren't decent pictures in the other settings, just compared to the Foilage pictures they are dull(er). So for basic shots, I will probably use the Foilage setting most of the time for all-around shooting - the pictures are beautiful. One problem I expect with this, is to get to the Foilage setting, you must use the top dial set to SCN, then using the free-spinning dial on the back, select foilage. Problem is, after taking shots and letting the camera hang against your body, the free-spinning dial may be prone to be moved to select another setting...One of the issues I do have, is not being able to choose to set the Auto-Focus frame to the center of the screen for many settings - such as Auto... I'm not crazy about the \"smart focus\" which chooses which subject(s) that it thinks is the main subject(s) - in my case of shooting mostly non-people so far, this \"smart-focus\" has been wrong. I think most of us non-pro photographers usually center our subject anyway, and even if we don't, we should still have the option of keeping the AF frame in the center... One other thing that hasn't worked for me is connecting it to HDMI on my TV. I'm going to take it to Best Buy and try it there. If it still isn't working, I hate to send it back because it is a good camera, but I would like the HDMI feature to work to see my videos in true HD.In summary, the wide-to-zoom feature is great, takes very good pictures (especially in Foilage), takes excellent video. The video option is excellent - you can take pics while filming, and you can simply press the video button in the back to start taking video even if you're in a picture-taking setting - very nice feature.If you're not a pro photographer and want to have a great all-around camera, this is definitely a good buy.

Naturally everyone wants better low light performance and while this could still be better, its the best I've seen in cameras other than digital SLRs.  Feature set is unmatched by Olympus or Nikon as neither have video or picture quality as good.  Stereo audio quality really does sound like the CD sound Canon advertises.  I was amazed as usually those small microphones overemphasize the high frequencies.  People's voices, birds and even the background rumbling noise that is typical of a large city were very accurately reproduced.

I played around with it last evening and was very impressed with the features and picture quality. I have a smaller PowerShot that I bought 2 years ago so I am familiar with Canon already. For $400 you cannot go wrong for what you are getting. The only thing that may trun some off is that it is a large \"SLR like\" camera which cannot be put into your pocket. Since I have a smaller one it wasn't a concern. I highly recommend this camera for those that want a little more quality in photo taking since the lense is larger than the smaller cameras which is beneficial in lower lighting conditions.

Cirminello \"rich\"", "ReviewID": "R1AGV9T8CCCVTT", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Bought this camera for my shutterbug mother for Christmas. Her previous cameras were all Elphs.Mom is 61, she's not a pro, but does take some of the best photos in the family, despite using pocket point and shoots until getting this camera as a gift. She doesn't really care about the finer nuances of photography (such as controlling shutter speed and aperture) but she does know a bit about the basics. Out of the box, we had her taking some photos on Christmas Eve of our relatives and she was immediately impressed with the quality and ease of use, but she kept her Elph 850 handy so as not to rely 100% on a camera that she wasn't familiar with.Once she downloaded the photos from both cameras, the joy that I was hoping to bring her with the gift was evident on her face.I helped her get to know some of the basic features and the built in picture modes; those are most likely what she will be using. I also popped my 580EXII on the top and let her use if for a few bounce shots.  While she really doesn't have any interest in carrying around an additional flash, she was impressed enough with the quality to consider it.Here are some of the reasons I selected this camera for mom:+ better quality optics than a pocket point and shoot (such as the elph series) - mom said she wanted a camera that could take better quality pictures+ easy to use; I had hoped it would be, and it was - I should add, that mom has been using Canon pocket cameras for some time, so this may have helped make the transition smoother in her case+ flip out screen+ hot shoe for external flash+ movies in .mov formatOn that last point, I was also considering the Panasonic Lumix DMC-FZ35, but when comparing it to the Canon, I was afraid that the movie mode would frustrate her. The Canon records .mov format which will effortlessly be downloaded to iMovie on her Mac without any other software to fool around with.I am a more advanced photographer (shooting with DSLRs for the past 5 years; experienced with event photography and studio) and here are a couple of things I wasn't crazy about:+ I don't like electronic view finders - although this doesn't seem to bother mom. She was glad to have the option to use the LCD or the viewfinder+ in full auto mode, the camera didn't seem to use the flash when you would expect (hope) that it would. We noticed this taking photos indoors of our family opening gifts. A brief tutorial with mom about the other picture modes fixed that: she used indoor party for the rest of the evening and it worked great+ doesn't shoot RAW - this is a complete NON ISSUE for my mother, but I would have liked a camera such as this to have a RAW optionIn the end, I like this camera a lot and mom likes it even more.I think it is perfect for someone who wants better quality than a pocket point and shoot, but isn't interested in getting involved with SLRs and all the expense, gear, and learning that goes along with them.", "Date": "December 27, 2009"}, {"Title": "Not bad, but not perfect either", "Author": "Teapot Tales", "ReviewID": "R1CX7659D3CW15", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "My personal experience with this camera shows that it is an overall good product (Made in Japan, BTW), but it has plenty of room for improvement.My biggest complaint in the camera's unfortunate tendency to over compress the JPEG images. Very unfortunate. There is no \"Super Fine\" mode there, so the full resolution images are never larger than 4MB each with an average of 3MB.Many people reported that this camera tends to add blurriness and noise to the pictures. I believe that these artifacts all come from too much JPEG compression. E-mail Canon to fix this in their firmware updates!Another bad thing has to do with the lens lacking any thread for light filters. There is a way of using filters, but you would have to buy an adapter ring for that. I mean, why shouldn't an SLR-like camera be suited for light filters?I would recommend this camera to any advanced amateur photographer, but only if the camera would not over compress the images or if it had support for the TIFF format.", "Date": "October 17, 2009"}, {"Title": "Canon SX20IS first impressions", "Author": "Thomas D.

I am very pleased with this camera.  Great zoom and sharp-crisp pictures.  To think of the 20x zoom but still so compact is amazing- it is much larger than my old camera- a cybershot I replaced, but it's still easy to transport and lightweight.  Only things I would change:  the door that closes the compartment that holds the memory stick I can tell could easily break off.  This is something you want to take care in.  Also I didn't know it until after I had shot the video of my son's elementary play, but while using the video, if you take a picture- the video shows this; ie: the video will pause and it shows a shutter capturing the image prior to going back to video- also on the video it picked up now sound at all- so FYI- don't plan to use this as a video camera- which I didn't I just was wanting to see the quality- which is good though.Big positives- battery life.  I was very leary about buying a camera that uses regular batteries.  In the past cameras, especially digital ones, would eat those things up.  I've always had to use lithiums with my sony cameras.  But this camera has great battery life.  I have yet to see the battery status even go down at all yet- a month later, using the lcd screen the entire time, and using it a lot.  Oh and this is with generic batteries that came with the camera, I imagine a good Energizer or Duracell will be even better.  I do have rechargable Ni type batteries that will work with the camera too, but not sure I'll even need them!  And the features- there are so many and so many settings, that for right now I just use the auto-setting.  I have been playing around trying to master the rest.A few quick points of interest:  the flash is only auto if you have it flipped up.  It does not flip up itself, but the screen will show \"flip up flash\" if needed.  I like this though as you can choose to have artificial lighting or not- I prefer pictures without a flash if it can be done.  I've seen where people said you had to use the Canon software to download pictures correctly and it does say that in the manual- untrue for me so far.  It downloads the pictures even vertical ones correctly but simply downloading via usb, or card reader and just using the general built in picture finder software we all have on our microsoft formatted computers.  I find this to be easier anyway so they save directly to the folder I want and I don't have to toy with their software (I'm sure it's a ploy to buy services and merchandise through them.Overall very good camera and very happy!!!!", "Date": "December 3, 2009"}, {"Title": "Differences from SX10IS and SX1IS (mainly HD video)", "Author": "Terry R.

These points are sorted from most to least important, in my opinion.Between SX20IS and SX10IS:+ 720p/30fps HD Video Recording (up from 480p/30fps)+ 12.1MP CCD Sensor (up from 10.0MP CCD)+ Mini-HDMI connector to connect camera display to an HDTV+ Flash range increased (22ft wide angle, 12ft telephoto, up from 17ft/9.2ft)+ Enhanced auto scene detection/blink detection+ Additional screen brightness settings+ Insertion of date/time information onto photos (note that this information is also embedded as EXIF data)+ Hints/tips on the screen for begineers- Sound recording/voice recording was removed- Superfine quality (least compression) was removed- Continuous shooting at 12MP @ 1.0fps (instead from 10MP @ 1.4fps)Between SX20IS and SX1IS:+ Price (at an MSRP of $399.99, the SX20IS is $200 cheaper)+ 12.1MP CCD Sensor (instead of 10.0MP CMOS, which has not shown much of a difference in image quality)+ 720p/30fps HD Video Recording (instead of 1080p/30fps with \"rolling shutter\" effect due to CMOS architecture)- 2.5\" LCD swivel screen (down from 2.8\" LCD swivel screen)- No RAW support (SX1IS officially supports RAW format)- Maximum continuous shooting speed of 1.0fps (down from 4.0fps for SX1IS)- No sound recording, no superfine quality- No wireless control available (SX1IS can use optional? remote for playback and shooting)Note: The SX10IS can unofficially capture images in RAW format, as well as exposures greater than 64 seconds in length (unlimited), through the use of CHDK firmware.  The SX20IS does not currently have a working CHDK firmware, while the SX1IS has a beta version of CHDK firmware.

It is a handsome camera, but a bit too big to tuck away, but I knew this before purchase. Handles well, swiveling back panel is very handy, and another reason I went with it.Movies are sharp(if you are steady), and easy to take. Special movie button gives great access to use.Operation is familiar to Canon users, not much change there, or in menus.Back ring lets you spin to another selection, okay but not a big deal.Now to the important part for me. Even with the stabilization in effect, there is blur in most of my super tele pics. I had expected some at the extreme. I think a tripod is a must for these. Wide angle to mid zoom are not so bad. You can't really use ASA settings much to help as past 200 detail gets eroded to a degree, past 400 very noticable. Much of this is expected in long zoom shots, but Canon's promise is the \"IS\" will help capture these shots. (some fact, mostly hype)I am still not sorry for my purchase, and expected I would have to hold steady for zooms, but I had hoped for better than this.Many reviews praise the features which are plentiful, but I would sacrifice a few doodads for better shots. I kind of think pictures are the bottom line maybe it's just me. Several write ups seem to prefer features to results, why ?? I do not know.Keep the camera steady, and you will be rewarded, but keep it very steady. Increasing the MPs on this from the SX10 is just a ploy to sell, it really doesn't help out, in fact it may be a factor in the degradation of resolution on the pictures. Pumping it up a bit more than design would allow.Anyway, I am somewhat disappointed, but I still like the camera, I just make sure I am a statue, if you shoot with one of those car window clamps, shut the car off, or all is lost.Pros: Design-features-swiveling back panel-hot shoe-wide angle @28mm, and a twenty times zoom.

I really liked my S3 from just about any view point: size, weight, image quality, flexibility, etc., so I was excited to hear about the SX20, and the good price, and HD video support.We only own one camera, and we use it to take pictures and video in just about every lighting situation, from day light, through indoor scenes, to fireworks. We have three young kids so  it is important that we can use it for everything. I wanted the flexibility to use aperture or shutter priority for some shots, and a long zoom is a must. Though all of this is a tall order, the S3 was a good solution. I was confident the SX20 would fill the space well.For some reason, the SX20 never really felt as good as the S3. One review I read said only 1 in 3 pictures you take will come out \"clean\", and I have to say this is about right. Even with the doubling of the megapixels (the S3 is 6MP and the SX20 is 12MP), the S3 always seemed to take clear pictures. The autofocus on the SX20 (as talked about in the reviews of others) seems to struggle somewhat, and I could never really get it to calm down -- this sounds strange I know, but that's what I felt.I tried many different settings of the camera, and I never really felt like the images were very high quality.Another twist came when I searched the Canon Web site, and found they have a flat-rate repair policy (US$150) for their cameras, and so I sent in my S3, they fixed it, and I have it back. Just in time to send back my SX20is before the return period expires. If I liked the camera, I would have kept it, but I couldn't bring myself to like it well enough.I would also like to mention a difference between the SX10is and the SX20is that is not mentioned much, and that is the lack of a superfine mode for storing the images. Both the S3 and SX10 have this mode, but it is conspicuously missing on the SX20. This is a shame, as the lack of RAW support makes me want my images as uncompressed as possible. From what I can tell, the three main differences between the SX10 and the SX20 are: 1) The number of MP, 2) The video resolution, and 3) The Superfine mode.I actually think I might like the SX10 better than the SX20, and I'd love to try it. I won't get the chance now, as my S3 is back and working like a charm.Maybe Canon's next version will be better, but I think I would skip the SX20.

It showed its versatility when I shot a sunset the first day and the \"sunset\" mode showed on the screen.  The reds came out almost surreal.  It seems just a little slow at capturing the image and I feel like I miss some second shots.Satisfactory or good items:Excellent lens compared to the clunky old zoom lens I used to have.All the settings are allowing me to get back into using manual settings and seeing differential results.Here are some disappointing elemnts:No printed manual.  It takes \"going green\" just a little too far.No HDMI cable enclosed.  I wanted to play back the 720p video, but I need to hunt around for a cable.The lens shade comes undone too easily.No RAW capture capability.  That's probably worth the extra cost with another camera if you really want to work on editing.I'm not an expert, but when I examine the shot's detail up close it \"feels\" like I'm losing detail to digital smearing, but that may just be looking too close.Recommended items:Buy a UV lens filter if only for the peace of mind in protecting the lens elements.Buy a lens cap with a keeper attachment, otherwise the lens cap is a hassle to retain.", "Date": "October 26, 2009"}, {"Title": "SX20IS is a good street camera.", "Author": "John Kane", "ReviewID": "R29K85A934LVQK", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "I think it is a good compromise camera. No point and shoot is at the level of a decent DSLR. They all have limitations. High zoom lenses are more prone to purple/green fringe. I do notice the CA in back lit trees and even on fallen brown leaves when taking photos of the forest floor. So with a zoom lense probably comes a tad more fringe. At least in this price range. The 12.1MP on a small P & S camera does introduce some noise. To minimize noise under low light shooting you will want to use the manual settings.I notice out of Box the SX20 takes washed out photos. It is best to shoot manual and customize your colors. Essentially all cameras have internal software today. So you can also increase sharpness and contrast. Hit Func set button, then scroll down to custom colors. I maxed contrast, left skin tone as is, left blue and green as default, bumped red up 1 notch, maxed saturation, & maxed sharpness. After I did all that, the pictures where sharp and vivid.I do get noise even at 200ISO when taking 10sec or 15 sec exposures. Noise comes into play anytime one increases ISO and/or uses long exposures. Shooting 1/60 shutter speed at 200ISO is fine, but  sec exposures and noise creeps in. It can mostly be removed by processing in photo editing software later.Any camera in the SX20 price range has some CA and noise. The SX20 will take sharp photos ones you customize the settings. I use a plugin the mostly eliminates purple fringe. So most of the photos taken at 4000 x 3000 can be poster sized to 13\" by 19\" after some software editing.As far as the HD video. I didn't buy the camera for that, have not used it much. Indoors with out the best lighting, when I panned around, the camera seemed to go to both sides of focus before it found the sweet spot. So a second here or there was out of focus. The zoom is  basically useless during video shoots as the camera will be out of focus thru the zoom and come back in focus after the zoom.I think its a decent camera with a lot of flexibility. My thinking was I wasn't quite ready to go the DSLR route yet. Every year the camera bodies keep improving and you keep getting more for the same money or less. This camera is to tide me over until I get s DSLR.One feature I wish this camera had is a remote shutter jack. I would sometimes like to take exposures longer than 15 secs. The zoom lens does get a lot of flare from lights at night. I tried taking some night scenes of a downtown city from a parking ramp. The more you zoom, the worse the flare gets. For these types of scenes only about 10X of zoom is useable.", "Date": "March 25, 2010"}, {"Title": "First reaction.", "Author": "Robert McGee \"Book Fan\"", "ReviewID": "R2XGZBFMBOHJHN", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Just opened the box and fooled around with it for about 20 min. My initial reaction is that I made the right decision. I am a serious amateur and have owned about 50 cameras over a 50 year period. My last digital camera was a Fuji Finepix SLR 4meg vintage 2003. I also have a closet full of Minolta SLR's and lenses. Initially my plan was to go with a Sony DSLR to use the Minolta lenses. But I found all the DSLR's too bulky and the reflex finders very dim.  Then I concluded that I should go superzoom for a compact versatile camera. I anguished between the Canon and a Lumix with very similar features, ratings and price. I went with Canon for two reasons, disposable batteries which I find very convenient and the articulated LCD.My initial reaction is that the LCD and viewfinder are both very right, the shutter lag is minimal, the reshoot time acceptable and the controls logical. I have high expectations. The only negative so far is sparse documentation. Maybe there is more on the web. I tried to fit a polarizing filter and can't find a mm marking on the lens barrell or in the docs. If that is the only negative i will be thrilled.", "Date": "December 1, 2009"}, {"Title": "Great Transition Camera", "Author": "C. Goode", "ReviewID": "RMPV4MHDLSL7H", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I bought this camera for my wife who is NOT a camera/electronics buff but loves photos of EVERYTHING - Christmas and birthday parties, inside and outside events, dinners, pets, birds, sunsets, all the stuff cameras are for.  Add videos to previous list.  And she is very creative, loves to put things together - homemade. Got one of these wives?  This may be the perfect gift.So a few years ago I gave her a small Sony digital camera, very nice and very compact but not great and we still use it, but she expressed interest in moving to the next step in photography.  SO this new camera (SX20IS) did more than I could have imagined for the price.  I added a 16G memory chip, a tripod, batteries, nice bag and we are off, man.  She LOVES this camera.  Easy to use, very good quality of construction, light, not too complicated so she can ease into the artsy side of photography.  If she REALLY gets into it we can upgrade in a few years and spend more bucks but PERFECT for the transition.She has taken great stills shots (including a pelican from 100+ yards that you would think was at 30 feet) and videos of tons of stuff.  I don't know squat about cameras and less about IS technology, but htis camera is quite amarvel to me.  Not all shots are keepers, some are blurry, but I think she has to learn the camera and its limits.  New stuff, especially electroncs are a bit intimidating for her but she doesn't have to be afraid of \"bad\" photos with digital, just shoot away, so her confidence is sky high, especially when she shows off the photos or posts.Now I am going to buy her a photo/video editor (perhaps Sony or Adobe product) and let her have even more fun.You may read negative comments on this camera, and I can see it has limits, but I believe IT IS NOT INTENDED TO BE FOR PROFESSIONAL USE.  So decide what you WANT and how much you WANT to spend.  This camera is a big time winner for us.  Best wishes.", "Date": "January 15, 2010"}, {"Title": "Better Than the SX10 IS, And Still Not For the Rank Amateur", "Author": "Ethan A. Winning \"ewin64\"", "ReviewID": "R6SFLPZZK81JJ", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I'll emphasize one point first - the same that I did with the SX10 - this is NOT a camera for the rank amateur or for someone who thinks that \"point and shoot\" applies to this camera. You can point it, and you can shoot, but if all you're ever going to do is use it in the \"Auto\" setting, you're wasting your money. This is such a versatile camera that using it on \"Automatic\" will get you average pictures. Of course, for some people, \"average\" is better than you've done in the past, so...I've had the SX10IS for almost a year, and have shot well over 10,000 photos. The SX20 has some improvements, and I thought it was worth the price to make life a little easier. In the past week, I've shot over 1,000 pictures with the SX20. All of these have been of birds, bugs, butterflies, bunnies, bees, scenery, and a few dogs. It's what I do. People aren't half as interesting. I leave those to my brother who has a Nikon Something-or-other and 30 pounds of lenses and junk that I no longer want to carry around. I will take pictures of my grandkids, but they're just that, snapshots. When I take pictures of wildlife with the SX10 or 20, it's photography, a hobby I've had for 65 years.Comparison with the SX10 and an Evaluation: Some things become apparent immediately on the plus side: (1) the wheel on the back is easier to use, faster, and more precise. So far, it doesn't change settings just by brushing up against clothing. (2) the viewfinder adjustment is more precise and spot on. (3) It is easy to use although the instruction manual has not improved. I urge anyone using the SX10 or 20 to read the manual. (4) The weight is fine and, even though I have a relatively small hand, it is comfortable and not at all bulky. Others must be comparing this to the Elph. That said, after four hours of shooting, even 18 ounces can feel like 8 pounds around your neck. I suggest, while keeping the camera around your neck, you lift it with one hand for a little while before it becomes a literal pain in the neck. (5) Battery life is still great. I do wish that Canon had added an ACCESSIBLE battery meter so that I could tell how much batter life I have left when I leave with a camera. Then I would know before I leave home whether or not to take an extra set with me which I now do as a matter of course since I never know when they'll die. The battery warning indicator leaves you with four or five photos that can be taken if that. Odd though it may seem, I chose the SX20 over the competition because it takes AA rechargeable batteries. While those may add a little weight, it's rare that I can't find regular AAs in a store, and I can always keep an extra set in the car if I happen to be driving to a location.What has not changed: (1) The camera is simply not made for low light situations, no matter what settings you use. \"Low light\" for me is a bird under the canopy of a tree even on a bright summer day. (2) The ISO has changed so that even at 80, you'll experience noise, This is worse than the SX10. At 800 and above, the noise is simply unacceptable. I keep the ISO at 200 or 100, and shoot almost exclusively at Av, Tv, or M. (3) I NEVER use digital zoom. If a bird is off some 200 feet, using the digital zoom may get you the bird, but it will be blurred no matter what the linear bar says. (4) Canon hasn't attached a cord to the lens cap since the S3 or S5, and I wish they'd bring it back. I USE the lens cap, and would prefer not keeping it in my pocket or even my hand while shooting. (5) I haven't found much use for the lens hood, and often feel that Canon added it to make the camera look \"more professional\" for those who feel inferior next to those using 1000mm lenses and carry 35 pounds of gear. (6) The SX20 is just as slow as the SX10, and that's fairly slow. \"Continuous\" is not like having a motor drive, and if you can get three shots off in 5 seconds you'd be doing very well. Birds, however, do not move for your convenience and three shots in a second would satisfy my needs. This does not. Even taking pictures of a kid running the bases is going to be missing something no matter what setting you use. Fortunately, I have the philosophy that what I miss today, I might get tomorrow. That does not apply to children at play although it might at Aunt Martha's 95th birthday party where nothing is going to move that fast.The SX10 has the same buttons on the back, but I always seemed to be pushing them by mistake. That, for some reason, hasn't happened with the thousand photos I've taken with the SX20. And I reiterate, the thumb wheel on the SX20 is much faster and precise. I can set the exposure - speed and aperture and even override the normal settings - in half the time as with the SX10.The macro settings on the SX20 became much easier and faster, though SuperMacro is just a pain to use. Supermacro must in my opinion be used with the LCD. You won't do much with the viewfinder at a distance of 5mm. It works, however. I rarely use it except for very small insects, but I imagine if you have a coin or stamp collection, it could come in handy although lighting will always be a problem at that (lack of) distance. Otherwise, I like the macro because the zoom works well with it. Of all the features that takes practice, it is the macro.This is my fifth digital camera going back to 2000. Four of the five have been Canons and, if I didn't need the focal length for what I do (nature photography of everything from raptors to dragonflies), I would have stopped at the A620, perhaps the finest all-round P&S; camera Canon has made. But, if you want to take a photo of a dragonfly or bird and can get within 15 feet of it, this is the camera for you...unless you like changing lenses, calculating for various conditions, and carrying all that stuff around with you.What I fear most is that, having now bought the SX20 is that Canon will come out with another P&S; that moves us closer to DSLRs and the need to have at least two lenses. After 50 years of using SLRs, I want easy, not complex. In fact, I might have told Canon to leave off some things from the SX20. I don't need fancy. I need accuracy and clarity. And I don't need automatic features with 30 different scenes. Because there's so many extras, superfluous extras added to the SX10 and 20, I can't say that the controls and menus are easy. Knowledge makes things easier, but the best knowledge is knowing what works and what you can do without. I use perhaps 40% of the functions of the camera.Oh, before I forget, the date stamp would have been very nice if the print was smaller and if it was in the lower right corner at stated in the manual. Instead, it's about a half-inch above and to the left of the lower right hand corner, and can ruin a shot that cannot crop out the date. I would suggest leaving the date for software. Remember, once you use the date stamp on a photo, it can't be undone. I emphasize that you set the Date Stamp to \"No.\"The LCD is still a great plus. There have been many times when I need it to \"see\" over a wire fence and the only way is with this articulating LCD. Other than those circumstances, I exclusively use the viewfinder, The LCD is primarily to see what I hope will be clear when I download to my computer.I'll repeat something else I said about the SX10: The Viewfinder on this camera is the best I've ever had! It can be set by use of a knurled ring on the left and, if you wear glasses, can make the picture you see through the viewfinder sharper than if you used glasses alone. It's five times better than using the LCD. For the viewfinder alone, I would buy this camera!I know that many people have bought this because you can now shoot HD movies. I used the SX10 for movies twice, and probably won't do much with the SX20 in this regard either. Even with an 8GB card, a movie of a green heron chick catching a dragonfly in midair can take 6-8 minutes, and that's a lot of MBs in the process. However, if it's your son or daughter running the bases, it's great! It is possible to take one frame out for printing, but the resolution and size will be smaller than a \"normal\" shot. Still, this camera is capable of an awful lot, and you might as well use it.All and all, I almost love this camera. If it were faster and could shoot in low light on a foggy day, I would love it. Overall, 4 to 4\u00bd stars. Considering that I've published as many with the SX10 and 20 as with my 35mm SLR, I'd say that my patience and the digital point-and-shoot have improved mightily.I compared this camera to four others (Olympus, Panasonic, Sony, and Canon), and I still ended up with the Canon SX20. The fact that they went to 12.1 MP means very little. The two extra MP doesn't make much difference, and they kept the 20X focal length of the zoom. However, I used the 24X zoom of a competitor, and there was so much noise at the upper end that I thought it was digital rather than optical. This camera was also more comfortable, albeit a little heavier, and I am really partial to AA batteries. It certainly is something to consider. (See my review of Eneloop batteries.)I rarely recommend anything to anybody. If I recommend something as \"sophisticated\" as this to someone who points and shoots and still cuts off heads and feet, then I'm to blame. If someone buys the camera because s/he sees what I can do with it, they often forget that I've been a semi-pro for almost 50 years and have had a 35mm since 1953. Would I recommend THIS camera? Yes, but with several caveats which will soon be forgotten.Postscript: For a number of very good reasons, I will not upload photos taken with this camera.

I compared the Canon SX20IS PowerShot to Nikon's P90.  Both cameras had 20x+ optical zooms, 12.1 mega pixels, articulating LCD's and a multitude of settings for any photo objective.  I was in no position to dole out $700 to $1000 for a high end camera with optional lenses. I needed to stay in the $400 or less range.I consider myself an advanced beginner who's managed to amass some terrific images of vacation spots, family and special events.  The Canon won the side by side comparison hands down.  First, the difference between 20X and 24X optical zoom is virtually zip.  The articulating LCD is nice, but I definitely liked Canon's multi-position version better.  The moveable LCD can be stored with the screen side in to protect itself from scratches and oily fingers. The weight of 4 AA batteries might be a deal breaker for some, but both cameras are well over a pound and require more attention.  I bought rechargeable batteries and after more than 200 images and endless in-camera editing and trimming, there was no perceptible loss of power.Right out of the box and a few test shots, the Canon SX20IS produced  some terrific macro images, as well as some extreme closeups of wild birds hitting a feeder hanging off our deck rail. (No tripod was used.)  I also tried both low light and bright light shots and the Canon adjusted itself with remarkable clarity.  I also like the movie mode.  The Canon is HDMI ready and has dual microphones for better sound quality.The only real argument or disappointment I have with Canon is NO MANUAL packed in the box.  Yup, you need to go to the Canon website and download all 180 pages of it yourself.  That's a royal PITA.  Canon's explanation was they do it to be enviromentally friendly...or green as they put it.  Really? What about the $370 in green I spent?  A pocket size manual or one that can go in the camera bag would be nice.  I give Canon a D- for this nickle and dime practice.  Finally, the lens cap is somewhat loose and has no keeper cord to keep it attached to the camera when not in use.  I solved this problem with a $3.50 keeper cord with an adhesive pad that goes on the cap.  (Thank you Best Buy.)Let's face it, unless you insist on doing semi-professional work or need pricey lenses for every occasion, the SX20IS is a fine choice for my level of digital picture taking.", "Date": "December 24, 2009"}, {"Title": "Canon Crafted Quality", "Author": "Billy J. \"REMARKable\"", "ReviewID": "R3QHGY6MOI3WV2", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "CANON POWERSHOT SX20IS REVIEWI bought this camera as my Christmas present from my wife.  It is my third Canon.  My other two (the Powershot A610 and Powershot SD1000) are terrific; so I decided on this Canon over my second choice, the Panasonic DMC-FZ35.  After practicing with most of the features, I used it for three days and nights at Disney World.  The Auto Mode works as good as any; and using the Scene Mode set to ISO 3200 for night shots without a flash was great.  The stabilization really helped capture those night scenes.  Following are my thoughts about the Canon Powershot SX20IS.PROS1) Fast auto focus to capture to write speed for a mega zoom  camera.2) Two speed zoom.3) Able to zoom while recording video.  HD is excellent.  Separate Movie button is handy.4) AA batteries.  The Digic 4 helps prolong battery usage.5) Great Menu and Function systems.6) Good lens shade design.7) Diopter adjustment is smooth and easy to use.8) Articulating LCD.  Good for self-portraits, shooting behind the back, overhead, or foot level.9) Review button can function as a power button to view captured shots/videos without the lens being extended.CONS1) No rubber grip around battery holder.2) No tether on lens cap.  Cap does stay on lens barrel.  I never had it dislodged when putting the camera in or taking it out of my camera bag.  A big problem with some camera lens caps.3) No separate LCD/EVF button.4) DISP button should list four view options.5) Indicator lamp should be positioned next to the Short Cut Button.6) Camera is heavy, but its weight is distributed well.CONCLUSIONThe main question is:  Would I purchase this camera again?  Definitely YES.  Even though I listed six negatives, only #6 is really a problem; especially if you have been using a compact camera.  The first five CONS should be considered by Canon for their next model.  While on the Jungle Cruise at Disney World's Magic Kingdom, I had to shoot with the camera pointed away from me.  Not a problem since I could swivel the LCD for the view before I took the shot.  This was a great feature of the A610.  Too bad Canon decided to abandon it from its current A series.  If you are an occasional photo shooter, then alkaline batteries will suffice.  Otherwise, get rechargeable NiMH batteries with a charger that can charge 1-4 batteries individually, has a battery discharge feature, and has individual LCD strength indicators for each battery.  Make sure the charger has the AC prongs attached that fold into the back of the charger.", "Date": "December 26, 2009"}, {"Title": "Great for those learning photography", "Author": "N.

Griggs", "ReviewID": "R1V4R2UAVYZ0NJ", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I wrote a review on the Canon SX10is after taking it on a trip to Italy. I can safely say the new SX20is, from me, will get just as positive of a review since my recent upgrade to it. And a lot from that review can be repeated here as well.  After getting the camera and finding a good home for the SX10 to a friend of mine, I read in some camera site reviews of the SX20 that there are a few undocumented differences. Most are improvements in features and quality, etc but there are also a couple things that were taken away from the SX20 that the SX10 had. The audio recorder was removed. The unit still records excellent stereo sound while in the HD video mode (improved from the standard video on SX10). Another revision was the Superfine mode. It's gone. Again, unknown why. There is also a slightly slower frame rate in the multi-shot mode as well. But all these minor differences can be lived with when comparing the great feature improvements. If you liked the SX10, IMHO, you're going to love the SX20 for, as the mentioned HD video, the graduation from 10MP to 12MP resolution, improved distance of the onboard flash and the new built in hint feature to tell you about camera modes. All the things that I liked about the SX10 are still on the SX20 thank goodness. Even the macro feature has been improved as well. But sadly, the full instruction manual can only be found in pdf format on the included CD. There's no printed full manual as was with the SX10. It was in print.  All the extras that I got for the SX10 will transfer over to the newer camera as well. Such as the filter adapter ring, filters, special lens, external flash, etc. I can still use my extra long life (2850mAh) rechargeable Ansmann AA's too. If you get the filter ring & filters, you'll have to get a new standard 58mm lens cap. I also got a lens cap tether that really keeps me from losing it.  Please, do not let anyone tell you that using AA batteries in a digital camera is a disadvantage. It's not. Proprietary batteries are expensive to buy extras and once the company discontinues them and your batteries wear out, your expensive camera is useless. I strongly think, AA's are going to be around for a long time. While in Italy, over 1600 pictures were taken on the three week trip. I was able to take well over 600 shots on the first set of rechargeables. But while in Venice, so many pictures were taken in one day, I did run out. What to do? Just pop into the nearest store and buy an inexpensive set of AA's and the camera was back in business. If the battery would have been proprietary, I would have been stuck. I now have a camera bag that can carry additional batteries. Ansmann and Powerex batteries have tested as some of the longest lasting capacity units.  You are going to love the flexibility of this unit's powerful zoom lens. It's equivalent to a 560mm zoom lens. With the SX10, I was able to zoom in to catch a full frame view of the golden Virgin Mary on top of the famous Duromo in Milan. The SX20 has the same lens. Unlike a full DSLR, you won't have to carry or change any heavy lens to take such a picture. Just zoom in and shoot. Macro focus is just as good. I've been able to take excellent macro close ups of the tiniest flowers. Again, without changing lens.  I carried my SX10 everywhere I went on the trip and did a lot of walking doing it. The SX20 is basically the same camera weight-wise. There was never a problem with the camera feeling heavy. Carrying extra lens with a full DSLR would though. Feature for feature, as of this writing, to me, is the best point and shoot camera you can get. Yes, a DSLR camera will take noticeably better pictures. The pros will tell you about minor video noise in lower light situations, etc. But overall, the quality of these photos are great. Unless you plan on making full size posters from your pictures, I assure you, that you will be happy with them. The automatic mode takes excellent pictures and you'll also have the advantage, when needed, to make manual settings as well like a full DSLR.

I will admit though that like with most cameras if you don't know what you're doing you can end up with some crappy shots. It's like how a professional photographer can usually take much better pictures than someone who does it just every once in a blue moon. I will admit when I first got this camera it intimidated me a bit. It's a bit big and then the features it has? Can be very overwhelming. But if you take the time to learn how to use it properly and experiment you can wind up with some really excellent shots. I own three different digital cameras now and out of all of them? This Canon has to be my favorite.This camera has a ton of excellent features. My favorite being the 'Custom' mode because then I can create my own custom settings and take shots using those settings instead of just using the Auto mode. Another nice feature is how it allows you to take a picture while you are shooting a movie/video. The 20x optical zoom also comes in handy for when shooting far away subjects such as animals, people, etc. Man I could go on for days about all the features this camera has. Another good one is articulating LCD screen. I love how you can move it in all sorts of directions. For me personally that is one big feature that absolutely sold me on this camera. It's nice not having the LCD screen just being stuck in the back but instead be movable.This camera takes AA or rechargeable batteries which I think is a HUGE plus too over those proprietary type batteries that a lot of other cameras use. It makes it so much easier to find and get replacements because most places carry at least AA batteries if not rechargeable ones too. Though I will admit since it takes FOUR batteries it does add some weight to the camera (this camera isn't light at all imo). Battery life? Superb.Overall I highly recommend this camera. I think it's an excellent camera for people who are willing to spend a bit more on one and willing to learn the features on it/how to use it or already are pretty good at photography.

I do lots of video clips at band and orchestra concerts and the S3is could not do a full 20-minute orchestra piece due to file size limitations.  When I got the SX20is I assumed it was an \"upgrade\" to my previous S1is and SX3is and I liked those cameras very much.  What I found is that although the SX20is has better video capabilities I was very disappointed in the full auto mode (which I used a lot with my two previous cameras).  With the older cameras if you raised the flash the minimum shutter speed used in auto mode would be 1/60 which is enough to stop motion.  With the SX20is in full auto mode I have taken indoor flash photos of people who are standing still (posing) and had significant blur due to the slow shutter speed selected in auto mode (1/15 - 1/30).  I can't imagine why if the flash is raised and therefore will fire it chooses such a slow shutter instead of opening the aperture.  This has forced me to try to take all flash photos with the Tv shutter priority mode, but then I'm trying to guess/choose the slowest shutter to freeze the motion and I don't always get optimum settings.  Furthermore, I like to use auto mode so I don't have to study the situation and make changes on the dial of the camera and possibly forget that I made those changes when taking the next shot.  I use these cameras for travel, and I like using auto because I can stop and take a quick pic of the family in a restaurant, walk down a street in old town and take outdoor photos, then enter a cathedral and take indoor photos with flash, all without changing the settings.  Well, that's not going to work with the SX20 because every time I want to use the flash I will need to avoid auto mode and force a particular shutter speed by using TV.  Also, when using Tv for flash photos I cannot use face detection (which I like) or any of the other nifty features available in full auto mode.Although I haven't fully tested it yet, I also got some blurry photos of posing subjects outdoors on a cloudy day when I raised the flash (for fill) and the camera chose 1/30 shutter speed in full auto mode.  I tried some without the flash and did notice slow shutter on those too so at this point I have lots of ruined shots.  I wish the full auto mode had a setting where you could specify the minimum shutter speed to use yet have all of the other features of auto mode available.  The same problems with slow shutter exists if you use P (programmed auto) mode as well.The quality of the video and sound are great and I am not disappointed in this camera for video, but the auto mode for still photos is a problem for me.  If you like to take time to think and prepare for every shot and change the settings I'm sure the camera will perform, but if you are in a busy situation with changing scenes and needs don't count on full auto to  make the right decisions.  I still can't fathom why a hand-held indoor shot with flash should use a 1/15 shutter speed!", "Date": "April 21, 2010"}, {"Title": "Fantastic Camera for the price, awesome functions!!", "Author": "William J.

I knew that I couldn't afford to go into to the SLR world, the lenses are just too expensive, so I looked and waited for a point and shoot that was within my price range, but also offered the features I needed. The very powerful zoom lens on the optical side was the main focal point for my buying decision, but even when in the digital side (including using the digital teleconverter) you can take some AMAZING pictures. The Macro and Super Macro settings are FANTASTIC for taking very close up shots. The flash is powerful enough on it's own, and you have the option to adding a dedicated speedlite flash to it's hotshoe, which is a nice feature. The fact that it takes regular AA batteries, or even better yet rechargeable Nimh batteries, allows you not to worry about replacing a special brand specific battery, which I really like. The fact that it only takes 4 batteries and it can last so long without having to change them out is amazing. And I have taken loads of pictures since buying this wonderful camera.Just picking it up, gives you the impression that it is built well, because it is relatively heavy. It can focus and take a picture pretty quickly, and you don't have a tremendous amount of lag time by the time you press the shutter button and the camera actually taking the picture.The camera is designed so that it is easy to understand how to change from one function to another. You can have it in the totally idiot proof \"program\" mode, or you can go ahead and go manual and get creative, trying different settings....i.e. shutter speeds, F stop settings, ISO speeds, ect..ect...The Video camera portion of the camera is pretty neat......I haven't used it much, because I enjoy taking pictures more than taking movie shots, but it does a nice job, and with a 8mb SD card (another thing that is nice.....it takes standard SD cards) you can take a TON of pictures before having to erase them, and it gives you plenty of time to take movies as well.Your creativity with this camera is pretty much endless, which I really like. The only thing I haven't figured out very well yet, is how to create depth of field shots.....that is tricky with this camera, but I'm sure with time I'll get better as I figure how to handle it a little better. This is my first real digital camera (I have always used film camera's, and I had one small little digital camera, that had very basic functions) but I have read a lot of reviews on this camera, and everything that people have said about this camera are correct and to the point.The only one drawback that has nothing to do with the camera is that Canon forces you to download the entire Owner's manual on to your computer instead of putting it into the instruction book. It's not a big deal, but for the money you are paying, you think they could give you a hard copy of the whole instruction manual instead of the basics that the printed one covers.All in all, this is an amazing camera, and it surprises me everyday that I take a shot, because there are sometimes when I take a shot and find out that it made the shot I took look even better than I anticipated. Hook this baby up to a blu ray player or if your Blu ray has an sd slot built in it, you can look at the pictures and video in HD. The pictures just jump out of the screen on my bigscreen!!You just can't go wrong with this camera, I would just make sure to get a warranty from Square Trade, because this is total electronics you are talking about these days, so there are a lot of things that could go wrong with the camera, with time.

I owned the sx10is, but recently sold it for this one, with its hd video capability.  I feel it is important to immediately address the fine vs superfine imagery quality differance between the two cameras. The canon sx20 does not have a super fine mode, however, I have compared (with a tripod, and side by side) both cameras..set the the exact same settings...both 80 iso, no flash, outside in good lighting (and inside as well)..both on its regular auto mode, as well as its program mode, staying the same with the settings and focal lengths with each camera (vivid turned on for both its its program mode)This is what I noticed: When simply taken in the normal auto mode, the canon sx20 seemed less vibrant in detail, as many others have complained about. It seemed a bit washed out.  However when taken in the program mode, manual mode, scenic mode, apature priority mode, or any mode which will allow vivid color to be turned on, the sx20 pictures turned out in all my shots, with more contrast, greater color, and just all around better pictures..especially looking at the images at full image size.  I was shocked. I looked at the file size to make sure I was looking at the right images, as the sx20 has more compression and is a smaller file.  Sure enough though, the small file sizes of the sx20 looked extremly pleasing to the eye, and was more than comparable to the sx10.  So I made my decision to sell my sx10 and keep the sx20 without regret. In addition to the excellent image quality, the camera has absolutly amazing hd video. This would be an amazing camera to have from the mountains of northern Spain, to the hillsides of France, to the rolling plains of Pennsylvania.

The shelf was bumped. The camera fell, bounced off another shelf and hit the ground.  Surprisingly enough it still worked, although not perfectly. Started getting an E18 error message and beep when I shut it off, coupled with the lens not wanting to retract quick all the time.  A year later, the lens stopped altogether.  Loved that camera, with its long zoom and versatility.  Went a lot of places with me and recorded the trips.After a little thought and exploration, I took the leap and got this sx20is as a replacement. Or rather, took the leap and said this is what would be a great birthday gift.  Been playing around with it for the last few weeks now.It's a great camera.First thing I noticed is that it's a lot more user friendly than my s2.  While it is certainly not a DSLR, it's well beyond an introductory point and shoot.  All manner of adjustments can be made, and what's great is most of them are not easily adjusted without having to go through several layers of menus.  This makes playing with it and honing the pictures significantly easier.The zoom is the most obvious reason to get this and it does a great job.  Focuses nice and easy, well beyond the range of my s2.  I've noticed that the pictures tend to come out on average a bit softer than my s2, however the overall quality is very strong especially as I get to know the settings that work best for the camera.It's a bit larger than my s2, so I had to get another bag for it, and ended up getting the Lowepro Rezo 110 AW Camera Bag.  The loose lens cap was something I found to be a problem, so I just ordered a Bower CK501 Lens Cap Keeper which hopefully will do the trick.  Also had to upgrade my storage card, as this camera takes larger sized files and cries out for regular videos, so I got the Transcend 8 GB SDHC Class 6 Flash Memory Card TS8GSDHC6.This isn't a pocket camera and this isn't a DSLR.  It's a camera for people who take pictures in a wide variety of settings and who see a need for a camera that can focus as close as 0cm in macro and 20x for distant shots.  It gives enough flexibility and easy control so that a person can have advanced control over the photos, without requiring thousands of dollars of investment in equipment.  It's not a camera for professionals, but it's a great camera for us amateurs who love nature, who enjoy taking pictures, and who want a bit of creative involvement in the process.", "Date": "November 4, 2009"}, {"Title": "close but no cigar", "Author": "L. Jaffe", "ReviewID": "R3G1K56R6ZBTQK", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "I purchased this camera after having used a Panasonic Lumix FZ7 (12x zoom, 6mp) point-and-shoot for about 3 years.  I like the convenience of a long zoom p-n-s camera, light, small, flexible, allowing me to carry it at all times.  But I was looking for something with a longer zoom, plus better resolution, as well as better response -- quick to focus, short shutter lag and fast continuous shooting.  I take a lot of pictures when I'm just out walking, often of birds and animals, where I can't get any closer and I often don't get a second chance to capture the picture.  I haven't been happy with the Lumix FZ7's unreliable autofocus or the awkwardness of the manual focus controls: I've lost too many one-time opportunities because I couldn't get a focused shot in the brief time some bird or other critter was in range.  After doing a lot of research, reading reviews, I'd narrowed my choices between the Canon SX20is and the Panasonic FZ35.  Since my experience withe the FZ7 never matched all its glowing reviews and Panasonic seems uninterested in supporting upgrading existing cameras -- no firmware updates -- I went with the Canon.  After trying for a week, I've returned it.To give the Canon its due, when it works, it works great! I took it out an outing --  2 hour stroll around my workplace -- and caught some great photos.  The best can be seen a [...] What these shots don't tell you, however, is all the frustrations of the shots that got away.  For instance, the one took forever to get into focus and had the dragonfly not sat patiently for more than 5 minutes I'd never would have managed the shot.[...]The Canon's autofocus almost never found the subject of choice on the first try, regardless of lighting or other conditions, no matter that the subject was dead center in the viewfinder.  I'd have to try and try again to get the image in focus, sometimes moving around my subject or tricking the autofocus by focusing on another, nearby object.  Often this didn't work because the subject didn't sit still long enough while I struggled with the focus.On the other hand the manual focus control was no help.  This is managed by a small, vertical wheel, mounted on the back of the camera.  The same wheel is used to change other settings by putting pressure on the N, E, W, and S compass points.  Therefore while moving the wheel for manual focus you can accidentally -- very easily -- engage some other function, like the self-timer, or the ISO settings, or flash settings.  Noooooo!  Again, birds don't sit around while you scream at your camera because it has foiled you again.  I think there is a reason that most cameras I've encountered don't combine crucial functions in one control.The other major issue was the extremely slow rate of continuous shooting, approx. 1 per second.  Most other cameras in its class can do 3 per second and up.  If you are tracking a bird or other moving object, such a slow rate means you are shooting blind.  I knew about the rate before buying the camera but really had to experience it first hand to understand how much of a problem it would present.There were a number of other minor problems I encountered.  It's heavy, like a brick.  I don't know why it weighs so much more than other cameras with comparable features, but it's very noticable.  I might have gotten over that if not for all the other issues.  The lens is not threaded so it doesn't take filters.  You can buy an adapter that will allow you to add filters.  (I like to use a filter to protect the lens.)  Perhaps the adapter and a corresponding lens cap will fit better than the iffy cap that Canon supplies.  Finally, the batteries.  While I'm not against using AA batteries in principle, the way Canon has configured the battery compartment makes it awkward to open and especially close again, taking way longer to swap out batteries that I'd like.  (The proprietary battery that comes with the Panasonic can be swapped out in under 5 seconds, which not at all the case with the Canon.)Bottom line, for still objects where you have have the time and patience to wait for the camera to get its act together, the Canon PowerShot SX20is is a great camera.  You will get sharp, accurate shots... eventually.  If you photography interest requires being able to get the photo the first time, don't bother with this camera.", "Date": "June 21, 2010"}, {"Title": "Great idea on paper, but Canon just missed the mark.", "Author": "Benjamin Kozera", "ReviewID": "R9R62C4KDCIJW", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "I've owned the SX20IS for nearly 4 months now and have sampled literally every function this camera has to offer.  Overall this camera offers some great features such as a 12mp sensor, 20X zoom lens, HD video w/ stereo sound, full manual and automatic controls, flip-out rotating screen, flash hot shoe, and Canon reliability.  There are other positive things to say about this camera as well, these are key points.On the other hand, my complaints are regarding the overall quality of images and video this camera produces.  I will say this first, keeping in mind this is still a point-and-shoot camera, in well lit situations it catures crisp photos and video with good color tones.  However, when the lights begin to dim and you begin to increase ISO sensitivity, the limitation of the relatively small CCD sensor begin to show.  The problem is that Canon tried to impress customers with a high pixel count and cram it onto a small CCD sensor.  This of course increases pixel density to 43mp / cm2 and light sensitivity suffers.  I would have preferred to see Canon build this camera with no more than 10mp to help this situtation.  In that case, however, you may as well choose the SX1IS for it's 10mp CMOS sensor or a G11 as it offers a sensor with a larger surface area for greater sensitivty.The problem is that any ISO setting over 200 is noticeably grainy and gets worse the more you increase it.  Plus, auto focus often times has to \"hunt\" to lock on the subject and sometimes it focuses on the wrong area.  I tried to track moving subjects in daylight while zoomed and the camera would often loose focus or catch something in the background.  This is likely do to the lens design rather than the sensor.But don't get me wrong, generally speaking this is a well designed camera with good intentions and is highly versatile as a point-and-shoot model.  But, there in lies it's weakness; it does many things well but not one thing great.  It's a jack of all trades, but a master of none.  I don't think it's junk because in the right conditions image quality is good.  Now that I've seen what it's capable of, and comparing it to images from my old S3IS, I would recommend that potential buyers consider a G11 for image quality, or the Nikon P100 as it offers lower pixel density, a CMOS sensor, 1080P video, a higher resolution screen, lithium battery pack and a more power zoom lens, though you do loose the hot shoe.  The Sony DSC-HX1 is worth considering as well as models from Fuji and Olympus.  If the hot shoe is that big of a deal for you and you can live without a super long zoom lens, just go to a DSLR.  Some models with HD video capability can be had for around $500; plus, the image quality and light sensitivity will be significantly better.Speaking of DSLR's, it seems that Canon had advanced users in mind when building this camera.  That is someone who desires the control and functions of a DSLR yet wants the affordability of a Point-and-shoot and the versatility of a long zoom lens.  However, unlike a DSLR, there are no threads at the end of the lens to attach filters and screw on lenses; something an advanced user would likely use.  Yet Canon featured a hot shoe for external flashes.  Just another one of it's quirks.Remember, overall pixel count is important for detailed images, but it's not the key deciding factor.  Virtually every camera today features a 10mp or better sensor.  This is plenty of resolution for anyone; do you really plan to print 12x16 photos?  Also consider, sensor type (CCD or CMOS), sensor size (if listed) and maximum aperture range.UPDATE:  I finally purchased a T2i about two weeks ago and let me just say, what a difference!  In all fairness, the SX20 is NOT a DSLR so it can't be directly compared.  The point I'm trying to make is that if you're considering an advanced camera like this, pause for a moment while you're at the camera shop and hold a Pentax K-X, Panasonic G1, Nikon D5000, Canon T1i or T2i.  All these models offer HD video and some of them can be had for around $500 on Amazon.  You may find it's worth the jump.", "Date": "June 11, 2010"}, {"Title": "Good features.

I was really interested in adding 720p HD video with widescreen.  Compared to the S5, this camera is pretty much the same as far as controls, and still picture quality.  My main problem was with the video.  I have two kids 2 and under, and I shoot a lot of my video inside under low light conditions.  The canon S5 was really quite good for getting video in low light conditions although it was pretty grainy.  Also, most HD video cameras are pretty good at low light conditions.  So, I expected this camera to be as good or better.  When I first pressed the record button, the screen instantly went to at least half brightness.  it looked like I was recording in a much much darker room than I was in.  I then started to compare it to my S5 side by side.  The S5 was probably twice as bright as the SX20.  I also compared the videos after copying them to my PC thinking it may be a problem with the lcd screen on the S5, and still the video was much darker on the SX20 than the S5.  Also, there wasn't a significant increase in video quality.  Just when comparing the two cameras lcd screen in standard view finder modes, my S5 showed the room much brighter.  Part of me thinks that I got one with a bad sensor.  However when taking still pictures the images seemed to turn out just fine.  I realize there is a way to adjust the brightness of the video while you are shooting, but even when I turned that all the way up the video was still very dark.  Also, it's worth noting that when zoomed out, the brightness seemed better, but after zooming in on an object, the object would get much darker than it was when it was zoomed out.  Believe me, I've seen all the great outdoor video samples on the web, and this thing looks incredible.  I wish someone would have posted some samples in indoor low-light conditions.

I wanted a step up camera from my powershot A 720 IS. After taking close to 3000 images with SX 20 IS i returned the camera. A little bit about me: Prior to the purchase i used Canon Powershot A 720 IS. I have used that camera for about 2 years. I've taken that camera through rain forests to ski slopes and have taken thousands of photographs. I am not an \"auto\" mode shooter. I mostly take photos in P mode and i vary many settigns to get the desired shot. Compared to my Canon Powershot A 720 IS, Canon Powershot SX 20 IS did not live up to my expectations. Below are my reasons for return:1) Image quality is worse than on my A 720 IS (I bought A 720 IS about 2 years ago). The images look soft and grainy. I have tried multiple ISO options and the noise (grainy artifacts you see on images) begin to appear as low as 80 ISO. Also, when zooming into a picture, I can see softness around the edges with this camera, where as my A 720 IS produced crisp edges. I have tried everything to increase image quality: from adjusting sharpness, color contrast and saturation in the camera to taking stills with a tripod and all those settings enabled. The result is still the same - noisy pictures and soft, almost \"fake\" image. I believe the problem lies in the fact that this P&S; shoots only in \"Fine\" picture quality mode, where as the A 720 IS shoots in the \"Superfine\", thus bumping the quality of the image and its apparent sharpness.**To Note: it was possible for me to reach satisfactory results with the SX 20 IS if i used supplied image editing software to manually adjust picture settings to increase sharpness and contrast(to make the picture stand out more and appear more crisp). If you find you enjoy adjusting images post shoot, then this may be a camera for you. If you prefer to take a picture and be satisfied with the result immediately, then my suggestion would be to look elsewhere.**2)Autofocusing was poor, to describe the best. Once again, my a720 IS produced better focusing. This camera has a new sensor which can continiously seek moving objects and adjust focus accordingly. On my camera it was not performing to my liking. While attempting to focus (zommed all the way in and zoomed out) the sensor would often focus on areas that were not in the center of the view finder, but more to the side, or up and down. The result - images were focused poorly, often in the areas i did not intend to bring into focus in the first place. Also, having only a limited number of autofocus points (1 maybe?) the rest of the image (outside of the focused area) degraded in sharpness significantly the more you move away from the focus point. I thought this was more of an issue with lighting conditions, however, under even the most perfect conditions (sunny, blue skies) i could still  notice the effect. I have tried setting the apperture to 8.0 (highest possible on this camera) to bring out the focus, even that didnt help. The aperture setting is not high enough to bring out sharper focus in near by objects.3)Continious shooting is nothing to write home about. This camera currently shoots about 1.2 frames per second (or maybe 1.4, i cant remember). This is NOT a camera for action photography, even though it does feature continious shooting modes and AI Servo. 1 frame per second is not fast enough to capture any motion (after taking close to 150 photographs of ducks at a local lake i kept only 6 - the rest were blurry and out of focus; the ducks were a few feet away from me - i did not have to zoom in too much to see them perfectly in my view finder). As always, comparing this camera to my A 720 IS, the A 720 IS managed to produce faster continious shooting than this camera, using technology available 2 years ago. If you want a camera that will capture memorable moments in your son's baseball game, do not buy this product - you will be greatly dissapointed with image quality of action shots. This camera may give you the zoom you want to get close to the action, but the photographs and the motion blur will leave you dissapointed. If you are looking for action photography, invest in a DSLR, or test out another point and shoot.------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------Positive Aspects:1) superzoom (equivalent to 500 mm zoom lense (but not quality of the lense).If you want an ability to zoom in very far, this is a good camera to have.2) adjustable screencomposing shots is very easy with this feature - no more having to tilt your head.3) good battery lifemy rechargable batteries lasted a good 600-800 shots without flash4) relatively lighti was not encumbered carrying it5)takes video720 P is nice and the video quality is good.For more reviews visit cameralabs.com------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------Conclusion:After 3000 pictures i was not satisfied with the image quality. To be honest, my exectation for the camera was too high. After taking pictures with A 720 IS for two years I was expecting the same image quality (if not better) due to higher megapixel count and a new processor. That was not the case however, as i found the images to be too soft and slightly out of focus (especially the further it gets from the center of the focus point). The camera shoots images in \"Fine\" image quality (instead of the superfine on A 720 IS) - i think this is the main reason the images look less sharp and less crisp than on my A 720 IS.If you expect better image quality than an older P&S;, you may be dissapointed. My suggestion, before purchasing the item, to go to your local bestbuy or some other electronics store and test out the camera. Since my other point and shoot produced sharper images (and image quality is the most important feature to me) this product dissapointed me.The camera has great features, however, if image quality is not as important to you, or if you have never had a point and shoot that shot images in \"superfine\" mode. Superzoom, great battery life, hd video, flip screen - all make this camera a great versatile tool.I returned the camera, and purchased a rebel t1i instead. After thinking that this camera would act as a DSLR \"bridge\" and seeing its shortcomings, i decided to invest an extra $500 into a mid-range DSLR. Yes, it is more expensive, but the image quality on a DSLR is far superior (in my opinion, having tested both the rebel XS, XSI, the 50D and the 500D (T1i), even using the kit lens.As always, try before you buy.

I'm not sorry I got this camera.  For still shots, under any conditions, it has been wonderful.  Video rivals that of an expensive camcorder.  Then I took it to an NHRA drag race.  During the morning, in the pit area, it once again performed flawlessly.  Videos were professional looking with practically no effort.  I was free of the 30 pound bag I carry my Nikon DSLR and associated equipment in.  After hundreds of shots and numerous videos, batteries still going strong, and since it uses AA batteries I didn't have to sweat it going dead and looking for a place to charge it while precious time was running out before the pros started racing. Then I got into the stands and racing started.  Nitro burning funny cars doing burnouts.  As I started shooting I realized that shooting multiple shots of something that goes from zero to 300 MPH in 1000' and 4 seconds was not going to happen.  Take a shot, busy message.  Could not even get more than 2 or 3 shots of the cars as they were slowly backing up after their burnout. At that point I would have gladly carried my 30 lb. bag all day. Now, is this a problem?  Yes.  Is it unique to this camera or Canon?  No.  My experience has been that any camera with an electronic viewfinder (EVF) is worthless for rapid, multiple, action shots. Purchasing a faster memory card may help alleviate, but won't cure, this problem. If you're going to shoot sports, action-nature, or any other genre that requires more than 1 or 2 frames per second, save yourself the aggravation and get some type of DSLR.  If you're going to Grandma's house at Christmas and want video in 720 HD and excellent photos, this is a great buy.

That was the question I needed to answer and the Canon SX20IS was the answer. I do a lot of hiking and wanted a camera that had better zoom capability and some ability to manually control settings like exposure, aperture, and shutter speed. I didn't want to carry 10 pounds of optic lenses to go with a DSLR so identified the Canon SX20IS as an option. I've used the camera for a month now and have had the opportunity play with it a lot. I really like the use of AA batteries as I can get these anywhere and they are also what I use for my other hiking devices i.e. GPS & flashlight. I'm using Sanyo Eneloop rechargeable NiMH and the camera goes forever with these batteries. The flip LCD screen is great and also provides for its own protection by turning it in on itself when stored in its camera bag. The camera has a viewfinder which is becoming very rare these days in all but DSLRs, trust me in bright sunlight the viewfinder is a blessing to use. I have used the video feature of the camera and was very impressed and would rate this feature as excellent, I managed to zoom in and out very smoothly videoing my daughter competing at a horse show jumping. Why buy and carry a camcorder when you have it built into your camera?So what are the pictures like? Truthfully I have had mixed results and trust me I have played with a lot of the settings and some filter combination's. In the auto setting I have some great pictures including some at 80x zoom (20x optic and 4x digital) taken hand held...they could issue this camera to FBI and CIA agents for great looonnnggg distance pictures.However, in some pictures the auto exposure badly exposed some areas when taking pictures while out hiking in the forest with sunlight streaming through the tree canopy. In addition the auto focus seemed to have a mind of its own and I had to often trick the camera to move the focus point of the camera. It may be that I just need to play with the settings to \"learn\" some new tricks and settings. However, in comparison with my point and shoot Sony DSC-W120 my Sony wins in the auto setting picture quality.

It is a great compromise between a compact camera and a full SLR.  It generally takes amazing photos, though, like other reviews, I found it doesn't do as well in low light situations without a tripod.  The main reason I bought this camera was the 20x zoom, which is the equivalent to a 560mm lens.  With the image stabilization components of the camera, perfectly focused shots at full zoom can be taken without a tripod.  On the flip side, it takes very good macro photos as well.

My first digital was a Canon Powershot S2 IS that I got when 35mm film began becoming expensive to get processed (about the time the S2 came out).  I loved it.  This review is for people like me that pick a camera they think is good, treat it like gold, and use it until it dies.  My S2 recently started with the black screen problem.  And since it costs about as much to replace (hm, it's outdated too) as it does to repair I went with replacing it.  I stayed with Canon Powershot and since I had an SLR wannabee I stayed with that too.  Price kept me away from the SX30 and SX40.  I picked an SX500.  So many things missing like the articulating LCD and landscape mode, and the weight!  So I looked again and saw the SX20 was still out there.If you're used to a Canon S2 or similar, and really want a camera just like it, you want the SX20.  It has all the newer bells in the programing while retaining the feel and features of the heavy Powershots.  It has a shoe for a flash attachment so you can get the flash farther away from the camera body.  And it's the last model that still runs on AA's.  Thank goodness rechargeables have gotten better because I like the weight in my hand.  I'll learn what I need to upgrade on my computer to use the new movie programing, and I won't miss trolling for the old SD (not-SDHC, because the S2 doesn't read those) cards.  I'm keeping the SX500 for when I want to get really picky about a still shot.  I understand they do really well with close-ups and portraits, and it does pick up amazing detail when I can get it to focus.  I also live in a household with more than one shutterbug so it won't get dusty.  But I will be reaching for the SX20 more often for my landscapes and capture-the-action shots.  Especially when I just want to auto focus and don't want to deal with a camera that's easily confused.  Really, comparing the two is no contest if you're just looking for an every day camera, but I found a deal and got both for less than I originally spent on the S2 back when it was released.Also got a hand strap for the SX500 that fits much better on the SX20.

I have even purchased adapters on amazon.com to put filters on the lens.HD video is an added bonus and picks up sound well.Also, if your batteries run out, double AA's are easy to come by.Overall, I am very satisfied with the Cannon SX20IS and would recommend it to a friend.", "Date": "September 12, 2011"}, {"Title": "Great PowerShot Camera", "Author": "Andre Creatini Da Rocha \"Andr\u00e9\"", "ReviewID": "R2MSZ3E0AY89V4", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I love photograf and have many cameras at home.

I'm used to shooting with a professional SLR but due to budget restraints have been using a small point and shoot for the past couple of years.  This camera represents a vast improvement over a simple point and shoot with many of the features of a full DSLR- and a LOT more portable.  I'm getting almost all of the capability of a DSLR with a quarter of the weight and cost.  No more aching shoulder from big bag and no more worrying about getting my $3000 worth of camera bag stolen if I'm not careful.One of the criteria that was most important to me was that the device use AA batteries for easy replacement on the road.  The batteries are housed in the camera \"grip\" as is the case with most of this style of camera.  Using Sanyo Eleloop rechargables is just great.  LOTs of shots and video before recharging.To me, the most amazing thing is the range of the lens.  28mm-550mm?  That's almost unheard of in a professional SLR lens, and the fact that it's still quite fast (f 2.8)at the 28 end is just amazing.  Still about 5.6 at the tele end too.  It's hard to describe the range that gives you but it's really pretty phenomenal.  And with Image Stabilization there's probably another 2 stops of usable range as opposed to non-IS lenses.  During it's recent tryout- a one-week vacation- I hand-held a number of shots at the extreme tele end with very acceptable results.Image quality seems great, build and \"feel\" is generally good, although it's not perfectly balanced and the hand grip could use some rubberized coating.  Layout seems good.  UI is good although it does take some learning to get to many of the features.  Ongoing process.  As others have said, no manual, so you have to print out the pdf file.  It's about an inch thick when printed on 8 1/2\" x 11\".  Articulating LCD panel is really nice.  And the viewfinder (yay!  A real viewfinder!) is not bad either, and comes with focus adjustment too.  Both the LCD and the viewfinder are 100% so what you see is what you get.And, the camera comes with a smart hot-shoe, so you get to use dedicated professional flash for added capability.Video quality at Medium is quite good, and sound is stereo.  I have not shot video at 720p yet.There's a lot to like here.  It's an amazing package.  I'm running a 16 gB Class 6 SDHC card and write times are pretty good.  You're not going to get fast firing rates like a professional DSLR, and it won't be great for real good sports photography, (you just can't get focus, firing and writing fast enough to enable good shooting of, say, a soccer player running back and forth and toward you...or I can't anyway) but it's great for everyday use.Only reason there's not five stars here is I have no idea how long it will hold up.", "Date": "September 30, 2010"}, {"Title": "My third in the Powershot IS line", "Author": "Mr. Rose", "ReviewID": "RB293MBABG3FV", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "As the title states, this is my third PowerShot IS model.  I started with the S1-IS, which was 3mp and 10x optical.  I skipped a generation and had the S3-IS, which was 8mp and 12x optical.  Now I'm on my third model (this one).  It's been fun watching the series evolve!The IS-1 was nice, but focusing sucked.  I really had to use manual focus or wait a long time for the autofocus to work.  This was improved in the IS-3 and is vastly improved in the current model.  What I really like about the focus in this one is that I can set the camera to display an enlarged section on the viewfinder to verify that the object is in focus.  SO NICE!The flip-out LCD was always a feature I liked in these cameras.  The ability to hold the camera over your head and rotate the LCD so you can still see what you're going to get is huge.  Crouching down for close-to-the-ground shots is a breeze.Super macro is another nice feature that I use quite often in these cameras.  I love taking really up-close shots of all sorts of things.The lens itself moves in/out as you zoom in/out.  I do worry that the motor will degrade over time.  At the same time, it's great seeing the focal lengths on the top of the lens.The lens cap is finally fixed!  Sounds silly, but the S1-IS could never keep the cap on, as it was a light \"pressure fit\" cap.  The S3-IS was a little better, but I found that the cap often fell out easily as well.  The cap on the SX20IS is much better.The movie mode is much improved as well.  I'm not so concerned about 1080p, as 720p is good enough for most of what I'll be shooting.  I can't wait to use the HDMI port to hook it up to a TV and watch a video on it.So far I'm loving this camera.  I could go on and on about how awesome it is.

Having had a decade or more laps before deciding to look through a lens again, it was obvious spending a large amount on equipment would not be a wise choice (digital equipment this time). I'm more than pleased with the Canon PowerShot SX20IS. It's an incredibly capable camera. It replaces an analog professional body Minolta plus two zoom lenses (28mm to 300). Comparatively the SX20IS added 200mm (total 500 optical zoom) with good image quality likely aided by its image stabilization; allowing hand held telephoto shots at photo speeds impossible with analog. That's impressive at less than a quarter the size and weight of the Minolta plus lenses. The result is it travels when the analog gear would have stayed home. After approximately nine months of ownership it has begun to sink in there are enormous advantages to a capable digital camera combined with a change in field approach vs. analog. The impressive analytical software of the SX20IS encourages your photographic eye by automatically replacing the extensive technical analog camera-information needed to attempt to make photographs appear the way you see the scene. The only down side has been learning the new lingo AKA software based controls instead of analog buttons, dials etc; wish it had fine incremental zoom control. It's not a professional camera, but its capability combined with software frees you to just seeing what's begging to be photographed. If it fits your hand grasp reasonably and you're willing to discover its abilities, you should enjoy this camera.

The optical viewfinder is just a tiny little LCD with pixels so large you can actually count them. It is OK for framing shots, but not much else. It does have a diopter adjustment for farsighted people like me. The light meter has problems averaging on indoor shots. Aside from these few cons, everything else is pros.

I really wavered bettween the Canon Rebel T2i with a good telephoto lens and the SX20.($349 vs. about $1200+) I decided on the SX20 becaused I didn't want to lug around extra lenses, however I suppose someday I will have a DSLR.Here are my pros and cons for the SX20Pros1. Seems well contructed. Not much plastic.2. Good auto focus. I have not had the problems other have had with bad focusing.3. Excellent HD video. In good light the video is great and you can zoom and auto focus which I don't think you can do with a DSLR. Can be a bit grainy in low light, but acceptable.4. Articulated LCD. I like being able to shoot from many different angles and flip inside to protect from scratches when not using.5. Electronic viewfinder. This is great because you can see all of the same info that is shown on the LCD if there is too much light to see the LCD.6. Zoom is terrific. I have even had okay pictures at 80x with a tripod. At 20x in good light pictures are almost always good. I have not seen any distortion. I took a picture of a quarter moon at 80x showing a good view of craters. My photo friends could not believe is was not through a telescope7. Battery Life. Seems very good so far. I am guessing 300-400 still pix per battery set.I like AAs since I have rechargeables already for other gadgets.8. Lots of different scene and manual settings.9. Flash seems pretty good. Red Eye reduction works well.10.Bayonet threads on the lens allow for a 58mm filter adapter from a 3rd party. It does work well. Why didn't Canon do this? I have polorizer on all the time.Cons1. A bit heavy and definitly not a pocket camera.2. The Control Dial is really bad. You need a very light touch when turning the dial or you start messing around with other functions like Manual Focus and Self Timer functions.3. Not sure about low light capability. I think this may be where a DSLR will do much better.Overall I am pleased.

The SX20IS can reach out so much further than the lens I have on my 40D.

Amazing, light weight, small size, full function, easy to use, wonderfully rugged, camera with thousands of shutter drops and not the slightest indication that it is anything but brand new.

Richards \"HappyHousewife2007\"", "ReviewID": "R30KN3QHXGTV6M", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I've had this camera for about three years. It's a good camera, but I have discovered some difficulties in using it over the years.1. It's really not the best for low-light photography. Yes, it has the 3600 ISO setting, but that's very grainy. Even if you're shooting close-up, the photos look like something you cut out of a larger shot and then blew up. I don't have much experience with low-light stuff so maybe that's just the way it is. Since I see a ton of really great low-light shots, though, I doubt it.The camera also considers just about every shot worthy of a flash. Even in my living room, which has large windows lining two of its walls, the camera constantly flashes the \"low-light\" and \"blur\" warnings. This makes it confusing to tell when a flash is truly necessary and when you'll be good just propping your arm well.2. Speaking of the flash- it's terrible. On-camera flashes have never been known for even lighting, but this one is particularly bad. Even on the lowest setting, flash photos end up looking very overexposed and just...well...\"flashy.\" The flash is much too bright overall and when looking at the photos, you can even tell the orientation of the camera because the flash is much brighter on one side. I've never experienced this, even with my cheapest point-and-shoot models.3. The menus and settings, while vast and mostly useful, are not intuitive at all. I want one menu that gives me all of my settings and other options. Instead, there are several. It's nearly impossible to remember which buttons I need to press to apply the settings that I need in the time that I have to get the shot I want.I also hate that I can't use some options in the preset buttons. I can't force a flash in \"portrait\" mode (or at least, I haven't figured out how if it is possible). In fact, I can't change the flash setting in any of the preset modes. The only option you have is flash-on or flash-off and that is only accomplished by raising or lowering the flash itself. If it's up, it's still on \"auto\" mode and will flash whenever it feels like it- whether you want it to or not.4. The manual focus is a joke. Really. When I use it whithin the limits it allows, I can't see the focus changing on the screen at all. I mean, I understand that this isn't a DSLR, but if you're going offer a manual focus on a hybrid, then at least make it a good one. Otherwise, just leave it off completely- if only to clear up some of that ridiculous menu clutter.Overall, this really has been a good camera to have. It's equal to and maybe even a bit better than my old film Nikon SLR. I really love having the super macro mode. Macro photography is something I've not been able to take advantage of since my sister somehow jammed the macro lens of my Pentax K1000 with peanut butter (*sigh*).In the end, I've gotten quite a few lovely shots with this camera. It's great for someone who wants to get good, clear, quick shots of their family but wants more options to play with than your typical pocket point-and-shoot.", "Date": "December 2, 2012"}, {"Title": "Super Superzoom", "Author": "steve", "ReviewID": "R2PIJTXDPJESGT", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "i've owned this camera for 4yrs.+ , and it still amazes me at times, at ISO400 or lower this camera ranks with the best of the best for image quality. this is truly one of canons best of all time", "Date": "November 20, 2012"}, {"Title": "The best point-and-shoot camera I have ever used", "Author": "Shannon C.", "ReviewID": "R3CR5LMVOGYG2F", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Let me preface this by saying that I am not a professional photographer. I have an avid amateur interest in photography, and though I am far from an expert on cameras, I wanted something that would provide high quality photos, enough options to let me play with and learn more about photography, but was not so complicated that it would be beyond my understanding. This camera did not disappoint. I selected it based on a lot of research, and immediately started experimenting with it. Prior to the Canon Powershot SX20 IS, the only digital camera I had owned was a basic $50 one with low quality and nearly non-existent options. I was delighted by the variety of shooting modes on the camera, and how totally customizable the conditions of the photo were. I like that everything is straightforward and easy to find/figure out, and I like that when I don't feel like customizing everything down to the last detail, I have the option of allowing the camera's software to automatically choose the settings it thinks are most appropriate. The quality of the photos are of noticeably lower quality when I let the camera fully automate the process, but I think that is unavoidable, and since I am not really in this from a professional perspective, it's nice to me to be able to choose whether I want to bother with it all or not.I am incredibly happy with the impressive 20x optical zoom that this camera boasts. It is among the highest that I have encountered on a point-and-shoot, and when the camera is stable (such as on a tripod) the photos taken from a great distance are every bit as clear and beautiful as those taken up close. I am also very impressed with the macro function, which is much more intelligent than the same setting on other cameras I have used. The close-up details that the camera is capable of capturing are wonderful.I think this is easily the best non-DSLR camera I have encountered; it's certain the most open in terms of what you can control. There are some quibbles I have with it, however, and they are as follows:*It should be able to take RAW images. It's a modern enough camera that there's not much excuse for being confined to JPEG, and I am disappointed by this, however the quality of the JPEGs is still high enough that it is no kind of deal-breaker for me.*The lens cap should be tethered to the camera. This is a common sense design feature among cameras that have lens caps, and I can't imagine why they didn't include it. It's quite irritating that I have misplaced or dropped the cap on several occasions.*I wish that they had allowed for longer exposures than the 15 seconds that this camera maxes out on. Long exposure photography is a common enough interest that it's very disappointing that Canon did not choose to make it possible with this camera.I do not think this is a perfect camera, but I also do not think a perfect camera really exists, and I am very happy with what I got. It is just as capable as I had come to expect after my pre-purchase research, and in some ways is rather better than I had anticipated. I would definitely suggest this to anyone who has a serious interest in photography but would be in over their heads with a more complicated device.", "Date": "January 28, 2012"}, {"Title": "Lens failure after two years, otherwise OK product", "Author": "drinsd", "ReviewID": "R5AVENFA88T44", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "Canon SX20 PC1438I was looking for a camera that would capture at least 720p video, use AA batteries, and have long optical zoom.  The SX20 fit the bill in being a \"jack of all trades\" as it did provide the above features plus many more as bonus.  However, the video capture was really a hit and miss due to the auto-focus function not keeping up with moving objects (mainly my kids...) and not performing at all with any light conditions other than extremely bright.  The camera did provide another bonus of a very nice macro mode, but one couldn't use the flash in macro mode with the lens extended to full length because the lens body blocks the flash light from hitting the subject being photographed.  Picture quality was also not as good as I expected it to be (comparing performance to my previous camera, I expected the SX20 to be leaps and bounds better than my old one).Also, I just experienced the infamous lens error.  The camera was being used to take pictures at an event toggling ON and OFF at a low frequency, i.e., I'd would turn the camera ON and OFF every few minutes as the event took place.  The failure occurred during powering down right after taking a picture and extending the lens to full length.  The lens was stuck about mid-travel to being stowed.  Pushing, tapping, and rebooting the camera did not restore operation.  The batteries were freshly charged.Given that factory warranty has already expired and that repairing the camera is cost-prohibitive, I took the camera apart but found no smoking gun related to the failure...This is my second Canon product.

We took it on our trip to Europe, and it gave us fantastic shots.  The 20x zoom works great, and the picture remains crisp and clear thanks to the image stabilization.  That is what really sold us on this camera.  I can't tell you how many times the superzoom came in handy giving us great shots of things that we wouldn't have been able to see with a normal 4x zoom.  Night pictures also turned out great, with very little blurring which was a problem with my previous digital cameras.  The articulating LCD is also nice, although a 3\" screen instead of the 2.5\" would have been even better in an ideal world.  Features and controls are very easy to use, and it allows quite a bit of manual adjustment as well.  A minor annoyance that I have with Canon is that they don't provide the full instruction manual with the camera, so you have to print it out on your own if you want a hard copy.The only downside to this camera is that its a little bulky.

I used the S5IS on a trip to Bermuda and was thrilled with the results. I created a DVD slide presentation and even on a 50 in HDTV, the shots were fantastic.  This camera produces even better pictures, 12 megapixels as apposed to 8 for the S5IS and a 20 times optical zoom as compared with 12 for S5IS.  The SX20IS has better video, more features, and a much better zoom.  I was amazed with the first shots I took and even when using the digital zoom, the noise was very tolerable and easily fixed with a good photo program. Using the digital zoom, I printed great 4 X 6 prints that were clear and sharp. I also have a Canon G10, a Canon T1i with an 18 -270 Tamaron lens, and a Canon XTI with a Sigma 18 - 200 lens.  When I compared the quality of photos between the these cameras and the SX20IS the DSLR did win but not by that much.

That's one of the things that sold me on the camera. I've used Canon's previous model of this camera, and the difference between the 640x480 and the 1280x720 video is amazing. One thing that's changed between models is the fact that you can't hear the zooming anymore while filming video. In the old model you could hear the mechanic of the camera zooming the lens in the sound of the video file. I haven't heard that yet on my camera.

I bought it for a trip to Australia later this year. am new to photography and wanted to get my feet wet with something more than a pocket point & shoot, but less bluky and cheaper than a DSLR or even a mini DSLR like the Rebel.  aside from the bulk of carrying lenses, i wasnt quite ready to make the jump to a $700-$1000 camera.As far as bridge cameras go, this seems to be a great way to go.  the picture quality is quite good and photos come in nice and sharp when properly exposed.  having said that, this camera is not a point and shoot.  it is also not a DSLR.  if you are expecting a substitute for a $2000 camera, you will be left wanting.  I also find it the make some questionable exposure settings when i leave it on AUTO.  it is fairly good size,  not something that i would be able to put in my pocket.  but it could fit into a midsized purse or a day pack fairly easily for a trip when you know you will be taking pics.back to the point that this is not a DSLR.  this camera cost $360!  it is not a replacement for a full size, interchangeable lense camera with a full image sensor.  having said that, the lense is quite amazing.  at the wide angel, you get the full 28mm (35mm film equiv) and at full zoom, you get the equivilent of 560mm. and that lense offers surpirsing image quality over the whole spectrum.  it does slow down (allow less light to reach the sensor) to F5.7 at 560mm, but it offers a steller F2.8 at full wideview.  the image stableization also workes wonders on this lense.the sensor chip on this is not the full size offered in DSLRs, this camera does have some low light noise.  i found that on AUTO or P, the ISO would go  up to 800 on a well lite indoor subject.  i manually brought that down to 200, and still ended up with well lit photos without the noise.  i cannot speak for the low light performance compared to other cameras in this class, but i have found little fault so long as you are prepared to dabble in the manual settings.  just dont expect it to be as clear in low light as your D5.The manual modes all seem straigh forward.  you can switch between apature and shutter speed with a flick of the thumb, and both are readily controled by the central wheel.  ISO is also easily accessable on the main wheel and the majority of the buttons are laid out with at least some amount of common sense.  the menu is also easily navigated and offers a number of settings from flash strenght to power settings.the flip screen is nice, although it seems like more of a novelty than anyhting else, i usually just flip it back to \"normal\" against the back of the camera view.  the resolution of the image is quite good. which is fortunate because the smaller eye viewfinder is of relativly poor resolution.  this is one of my gripes with this camera.  if you are going to include a viewfinder, at least give it as good of resolution as the main screen.  it is pretty much worthless for determining focus or fine picture taking.I strongly recommend that you spend the $12 on the aluminum 58mm lense thread adapter.  this camera does not come with one and while i do little in the way of filters, i do like having a clear UV filter to protect my lense.This camera also has a hot shoe for those of you who will be doing anything that requires a finner tuch than the built in flash.  i would by one if i were to do pictures for anything like a wedding where the built in would be to direct.The 4 AA batteries were one of the buying points for me.  It is good to always be able to get batteries and since i currently live in italy, and i travel alot, being able to carry or buy spares is important. on that note, i have taken about 200 pics,  many with flash and about 8 min of HD Video (looks and sounds great BTW) and the batteries are still going strong.over all i am happy with my purchas and think that this camera is going to end up being a good camera at a good price.

The extra zoom and extra pixels are nice for cropping and the pop up help captions reviewing the manual functions were very useful.  I am not an expert photographer, however based on the comments of many who review the pictures I keep they are amazed.  I kept with the canon's because all of the accessories are compatible, very little learning curve.  I never run out of fresh batteries, and the other family members love when I upgrade. It is an awesome point and shoot camera.  I made the decision that we will look allot more at stills than sitting down to watch videos.  So I concentrated on the picture taking and I am glad that at any second I can push the video record button and almost as much control of the video, zoom etc., as a real video camcorder. The video is more than good enough for family movies and fun caught on the spot. So if you like taking allot of pictures and your family isn't interested in learning all of the manual controls associated with this camera, this would be a great buy.

My wife and I enjoy taking pictures using an extended zoom, but didn't want to lug around the kind of lens needed with a DSLR to equal the 20X  Zoom of this camera. The video capability with good sound recording was also important to us. The stereo mics on the front, rather than the top of the camera were one deciding factor. Sample pictures posted by reviewers were of amazing quality for the price point. The value of what you get for the purchase price of this camera is amazing. I checked out the Panasonic FZ 35 which has a comparable but smaller zoom, and the Nikon P100 which has a 26X zoom. The thing that most set the Canon SX20 apart from the other two is the quality of the Image Stabilization system. It is far superior, especially when compared to the Nikon. This camera is what the reviews say it is! I couldn't be more pleased with the performance so far. The versatility of the camera is outstanding, and I've already taken some beautiful shots. I love taking scenery shots, and this camera is excellent for that purpose. Two things that affected the timing of our purchase is that we have a daughter that is getting married in July, and we are going to Maui later this summer to celebrate our 25th wedding anniversary. I look forward to all the photo opportunities in Hawaii. This camera is perfect for travelling and doesn't add alot of weight to your luggage! My wife is thrilled with the video capability of the camera. We love this camera!UPDATE: After owning this camera for several weeks I have a few more comments: The camera is very ergonomic and easy to handle. It feels sturdy, but is not too heavy. Controls are rather intuitive and easy to navigate. The size and portability make this an easy camera to carry around. My son, who is a professional photographer has told me that he is thinking about purchasing a smaller camra like this for some of his shooting needs, when he doesn't want to have to carry alot of equipment/lenses around. He is a Nikon DSLR user, but is very impressed with the Canon SX20.The electronic Viewfinder is very helpful when shooting in bright sunlight. However, the LCD brightness is more than sufficient for outdoor shots not in the bright sun.  The Auto setting is very effective. I have been able to take some outstanding scenery pictures using Auto. The Foilage setting brings out even more vibrant colors and is particularly useful when shooting pictures with extensive greenery in the background. The quality of pictures with this camera is remarkable. I have used several of the various scene settings, but have yet to experiment with the manual settings, though I am thankful that they are available. Many people have complained that the manual is not printed in booklet form. Personally, I think the electronic version is better. I downloaded a copy to my laptop, and have easy access to the information I need. If Canon had printed the manual to package with the camera, it likely would be much smaller than the current 180 pages, and would contain less information.

Here are what I feel are the pros and cons of this camera coming from a new-user perspective.Pros:- Camera feels solid and quality feels good.- Great for day-time, action and macro photos.- Quick to boot, quick to shoot.- Auto mode is useful and gets the scene right most of the time.- Video quality is good and video sound is good enough.- All modes are pretty easy to use once you understand the capability.- Camera + small bag will fit into a glovebox. =)- Nice photo zoom capability.  Even digital zoom works pretty good.- Has every feature I could ever want on a camera and then some.Cons:- Auto-mode focus weirdness.  Sometimes takes a while to focus.- Partial manual.  I had to download and print.- No built in threads for a lense filter (filter adapters are available).- Not for big hands.  My big fingers keep covering the focus emmiter.- Focus flakes when taking videos with high zoom.- Built-in flash doesn't sit high enough to use for close-up night shots.- Bright reflections / glare can create artifacts in video.- Must have hands of lead for low-light without flash.I took the camera to the local airshow on a bright day and got some great pictures with it.  Every picture I took was nice quality, even for very high speed fly-bys (action shots) at high zoom (20x).  I was disapointed however to find out that some of the video I shot had artifacts when the sun was glinting off the airplane surfaces.  Also I learned quickly to avoid zooming while taking video.  The camera gets confused and looses focus while zooming and several of my videos were relegated to the bit-bucket because of that.Low light photos are okay.  Without flash the images are a little bit more grainy that I was hoping for.  Increasing the exposure to compensate means you have to hold the camera super-still.  A tripod is probably best for low-light no-flash scenes.  The super-long exposure capability does make for some pretty neat night-time streak/movement effects pictures though.All in all I'd say this is an excellent camera for noobs like myself.

Amazing camera from an experienced and reliable company. Very simple to use, just point and shoot and get great HD pics, menu layout simply formatted too. Like any camera, you have to have a steady hand or a tripod to get the HD quality photos from it, image stabilizing only helps slightly in photo mode, works really well in video mode. In other words if you get bad pics it's not the camera. I can take bad pics with this camera and I can take HD pics with it as well, it all depends on how steady you hold it, a good tripod will guarantee that HD shot everytime. I do recommend you get the Sanyo Eneloop batteries for this camera as it won't last long on store bought batteries. Eneloop's are the best quality rechargables, they'll last 3 times longer than store batteries and they don't lose their charge when not being used like the Canons & Sonys do. The camera takes 4 AA's so get at least 8 of those Eneloops so you have backups. These batteries will run this camera in viewing mode on your HDTV for a very long time so the optional AC power cord is not necessary unless you plan to run it for hours at a time. The camera does not come with a SDHD memory card so you'll have to buy one, I recommend at least a 8GB SDHD card so you can shoot a decent amount of short HD video and store lots of pics too. I also bought a HDMI to mini HDMI adapter cable to view HD pics and video on my HDTV, works awesome. I'm not a professional photographer but I am a fussy critic to mediocure products and this Canon SX20IS is not one of them. I am however an audiophile and I know fine quality when I see it. One other thing I'd like to mention to the sceptics of buying these type of expensive electronics from Amazon, NO WORRIES, just make sure it's exclusively fullfilled by Amazon. It's worth paying the little extra \"if\" Amazon's price is higher because of their exclusive guarantee and the peace of mind it will give you. I buy everything from Amazon including my 46 inch HDTV and I can personally testify to there integrity to please customers.

The way I went about narrowing it down to the Canon SX20IS was simple, I researched every single customer review that I could find on every dealer's website. What I found was that for the most part the negative reviews referred to some very trivial criticisms like the lack of a printed manual or the lack of an attachment to secure the lens cover. Perhaps the only serious negative comment that I could find referred to the camera not providing RAW output. I can live without it.On the other hand, having bought this camera, I now agree with the reviewers who liked in particular the swivel screen, the quiet 20x zoom, the automation and the picture quality. Sure, it would be nice if Canon had included a printed manual but it seems that most manufacturers today are moving towards their documentation on electronic media.If I had to think of one or two negatives it would be the lack of internal memory which is included in most other cameras in its price range, also the lack of an HDMI connectivity cable for my HD TV.The SX20IS is so feature-rich that it will take months to use this camera expertly, but once you get the hang of it you will love it.", "Date": "November 7, 2009"}, {"Title": "Great camera with one unfortunate caveat.

With a hotshoe for a flash (which works with my 380EX Speedlite from my 1990's EOS ElanII), manual controls and an awesome relatively wide to ultrazoom lense, I was smitten.  Knowing that I would be substituting some lense quality for portability and convenience, I ordered the camera.  After playing with the camera around my house and yard, I'm very content with the picture quality, speed, flash, and versatility.  The only caveat is the focusing ability; it's not even as good as my decade old Elan or my relatively compact PowerShot A710 IS.  If the camera has a face to focus on it does a decent job, but if you're not taking a picure of a face it's mediocre.  I did notice that when using the camera in real life scenarios (and not just playing with it around the house) it did better than I thought it would.  Less than a week after purchasing the camera I got to really test it out.  I was invited to a CBS taping of the Reba Thanksgiving special.  Unfortunately the audience only had 30 seconds to take pics of Reba (absolutely rediculous).  Well the camera payed for itself!!  I got 25 pics in those 30 seconds using my 380EX Speedlite and only a couple were out of focus.  Anyway... I love my PowerShot SX20 IS: awesome pics, amazing and versatile lense (zoom and wide angle), quick performance, versatile settings (from point and shoot to complete manual), articulating screen (realized it's benefit taking pics of Reba), and good HD video.

The A610 was a 5MP camera but still took excellent shots (if the correct settings were applied). I found many features of the SX20 IS similar to the A610 but being a 12MP camera with 20X optical zoom I believe it has the potential for better distance shots and taking HD quality video (again, if the correct settings are applied). Since I have only had it a couple of months I am still learning the finer aspects of taking high quality pictures and finding the correct settings can be complex, particularly for a novice user. That said, I can't say it is the best camera for the money out there even though it's predecessor, the SX10 IS, was highly rated by Consumer Reports. It is not what I would call highly portable as it has the size and heft of some DSR cameras and I will probably buy another smaller camera that I can just put in my shirt pocket for every day use. The only real bones I have to pick with Canon at this point is that they could have designed a better quality access cover for the download and HDMI ports and a lens cover that is attached to the camera via a tether to prevent loss. The cover could also be made to get on and off easier. In summary, it seems to be a good quality camera but still to soon to pass final judgement.

I'm not a professional, but I do enjoy photography as an artistic hobby. I wasn't sure if I wanted to spend the money on a DSLR, so I bought this as a step between that and my point-and-shoot. After a year of using it, I realize that I should have invested in the DSLR. I viewed a lot of sample photos online, taken by others who own this camera, but unless you are using a tripod or shooting outside, the average quality of this camera's photos are just not impressive.Picture quality - While the high megapixels are a positive, I find that unless taken in ideal conditions (bright sunlight), the photos come out grainy and/or blurry, so they look low quality anyway. No amount of experimenting with the ISO or other features has solved this. Also, objects in the photos aren't clearly defined - there is often a blue or white fuzzy edge around the subjects. One of my biggest complaints is that in most lighting conditions, especially indoor natural light or outdoor cloudy light, there is an extraordinary amount of white blowout. The 20x zoom is great, but again, unless you are shooting in ideal conditions, it's hard to get a crisp shot.Video - The video is high quality, while not professional, but for everyday use, it's convenient to have HD video options as well as photos in the same camera. I especially like the \"record\" button on the back of the camera, which is much faster than having to turn a dial to shoot in video.Body - This camera is as large as a DSLR, but for the added bulk, the picture quality is just not worth it. The camera itself weighs about a pound, but takes four AA batteries, which adds a lot of weight. Having gotten used to a rechargeable battery in my previous camera, I can't help but notice how expensive it is to keep buying new batteries. Battery life is average. I've had some difficulty opening/closing both the battery lid, and the flap lid for the memory card (I have to force them to move). The shutter button frequently gets stuck, so I have to try multiple times, and I have frequently missed the shot that I wanted because I couldn't make the camera take the picture. More often, I have to apologize to people posing for the photos because it takes a good fifteen seconds, and a lot of wiggling the shutter, before the picture is taken. The one feature that I love is the large screen that you can flip in any direction.Features - The list of features seems impressive, but when actually put to use, none of them contribute to a higher picture quality. I have never gotten a clean shot using macro, a feature I loved on my previous Canon.All in all, this camera takes photos equivalent to a smaller, cheaper Canon Powershot, but for twice the cost, it's not worth it.", "Date": "May 25, 2011"}, {"Title": "Nice camera, well rounded", "Author": "Dave S", "ReviewID": "R2LF3GJT6T6H1G", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I usually don't write reviews, but I love to read them before I purchase anything.

I would probably say after owning both I would be a little partial to Canon.  We have a Canon T2i currently, but I wanted something more portable for family vacations.  I didn't want to buy another camera and camcorder, and I saw this one in a store and was instantly drawn to it thinking it would fill my needs for an upcoming vacation.  While the SX20is isn't what I would call small and light, it certainly is compared to large SLR's.  I bought it after researching and testing others in this niche and have been very pleased with it.  After our vacation, I was reviewing some of the photos and videos we took with this little machine and was actually quite surprised.  I am used to the look of a photo taken by a nice digital SLR so I had already kind of doomed this thing before it really had a chance.  It really did surprise me!  While the photos aren't as sharp as SLR (as others have mentioned), they are very good.  I do suggest printing out the manual ( I know it's a bummer), but it is well worth it.  Use the manual settings, after playing with it for a bit, these settings are not hard to remember.  It will make a difference in your photos.  The videos we shot were very clear, had nice audio, and so easy to play back.  Overall, extremely happy with this purchase.

Just returned from a ski trip, carried it in my fanny pack.  Terrific color, ease of use, stabilization and best of all, the telephoto!  Interior night shots were excellent, low light not a problem.  Recommend a class VI (6) or above SD Memory card for quickest camera response in writing to memory.  Battery (rechargeable) not a problem, even in cold weather.Camera still new to me, but has exceeded my expectations to this point.  No video shot yet.Strong buy recommendation if you are looking for a larger than pocket camera, but smaller that Nikon standard body with most or all of the features at a reasonable price.

They even didn't charge for return shipping. Great service.Anyway, now I have SX20IS which takes even better pictures and HD videos.I am impressed with the quality of HD videos this camera makes. If you are moving the camera while taking videos, have to move slow to get smooth video and avoid video stutter. But still it's quality is better than Panasonic camera I looked at.It's a little heavy due to 4 AA batteries, but cheaper and less bulkier than SLRs. I had to buy a lens cap holder $1.50 and a hand strap around $6 (not really needed, but secures the camera from falling). Lens hood provided (when attached) seems to put a small shadow at bottom center of the picture taken (not very significant).Overall I am very happy with the picture quality and video quality.

Yes, you may get less photos per set of batts, but you will always get your photos.  I think the still camera is decent (excessive noise reduction is annoying), but I mainly use mine for video.  Yes only 720p, but very nice.  You have a manual focus and manual audio overide which is amazing in a consumer camera.  The IS works great too.  I also like that the SD card has it's own door--you don't have to open the battery compartment to get to the card--yes, a small point, but when you shoot a lot of video like me, it's important.

Zoom, especially when pushed to digital limits, is relatively useless in stage situations.  Due to low lighting, need a tripod which is difficult in a auditorium setting. I guess I expected more from the stabilizing feature.  If there is low light the human heartbeat makes the camera shake icon come on if you zoom at all.  When I discovered you can turn the intensity of the flash up and down, I thought that might help.  However, if you have any foreground objects, such a people's heads, the glare off them ruins the picture.  Not really a criticism of the camera but my own knowledge of the workings of photography and what I needed.  I have taken marvelous outdoor shots of people, nature and sunsets.

But scrapbooking is my main hobby.  With 3 kids, 2 who play soccer, I was looking for a camera that would take good, movement pictures from a distance.  This camera fits the bill perfectly!  Granted, there are times when a tripod is necessary to eliminate all of the blur.  That's just true of ANY camera that zooms from a far distance.We can take close-up shots at home without washing out the target of the photo.  We have taken excellent outdoor photos under all different lighting situations.  We've taken pictures of the Christmas lights on the house without blur - many digital cameras blur out and you don't see the detail.  Every picture comes out perfect ----- unless there's some human error in there which happens on occasion.We've taken videos in the snow - often times, filming snow is difficult.

Later, we assume he kicked it out of the car when getting in or out.We left the hood on permanently after that until I lost it at the zoo.  I was walking around with the camera on my shoulder, hood on the end, ready to grab it at a moment's notice.  I looked down at one point and the hood was gone.  The fit was always a little loose and I guess bumping against my hip loosened it enough for it to fall off.I have now purchased a new hood and lens cap (both through Amazon, totalling $20 for both).

Power by \"AA\" batteries is a requirement for me because I standardize on rechargeble \"AA\"s for all my electronics that I travel and hike with. I expect to use the articulated LCD view screen for those overhead and waist level shots that were so frustrating with my Fuji. I have seen the benifit of the image stabilizing with just the few test photos I've done so far.  The SX20IS is heavy compared to my fuji Which is a plus for holding it steady but a negative for packing light. Also the grip for the right hand is a little slipery which with the extra weight makes those necesary one handed shots harder to control. I am frustrated with having to go on line for the users manual. I don't always have access to internet or a computer and if I print it on my printer it is a big package.

Nothing photoshop can't fix up.>720p video uses a lot of power, and a lot of memory card space.>You can hear the zooming while zooming on video.I've used this camera over the course of four days at an air show, it performed very well. Can't compete with the quality of some SLR shots I've seen, but this camera got a lot of good photos. The video is VERY nice, so nice that one of the performers featured my video on their website.Night shots are great as long as the ISO is low to avoid noise, got some amazing lunar eclipse shots. Macro shots took some time to get right, the auto-focus has trouble with a close subject, that's where the manual focus comes in handy.Overall very happy with my purchase.

I knew I wanted more than a simple point-and-shoot camera because although the pocket-carrying convenience is great, the pictures don't always come out great. The last thing I wanted was my first trip to the Great Wall to leave me wanting more in terms of a camera.The only inconveniences: (1) the initial setting for a 2-second lag between taking pictures. However, I was able to change the setting on the camera so it did not show the preview, and then it was ready to take another picture within milliseconds. (2) at times the camera was too big to have so I didn't take it with me when going out at night, etc.The good: I was concerned about the battery; however, I took approximately 800 pictures and combined total of nearly 15 minutes of video on an SDHC Class 4 card, and only had to change the four AA batteries once during the 10-day trip. The pictures when I took a few seconds to position the camera and focus on the shot came out excellent. The ones where I was clicking just to capture various things came out okay. This is to be expected. The zoom was extremely handy. I have never had the luxury of such an incredible zoom -- once I used it to zoom into a road sign a couple of blocks down just to make sure we were walking in the right direction! And the pictures zoomed in came out good (not grainy).I ordered the camera on a Thursday evening on Amazon, and had the camera at my doorstep on Monday afternoon.

Many of my pics are shared with other wildlife lovers on message boards. I also have 13 nest boxes placed around the perimeter of a very large back yard. I can see the birds little faces peeking out and the shots come out nicely.My Dad was a professional portrait photographer. I have decided this camera is taking better photos than the fancy rig in his studio.Just for fun and as another learning experience I took a photo of a friend from about 250 feet away while he was clearing brush from a neighbor's burn pile. It looks like he only 20 feet away. There's no mistaking who he is whe you see the pic. His face is in perfect focus and his big new orange dirt mover is an absolutely perfect representation of the color.I have become used to the increased weight and am much steadier in handling the added weight. Only took a week to get used to it.Years ago I had a 35 mm SLR plus huge lenses and I ran around under parachute jumpers taking their pics while coming down.

First,I could not zoom more than half way without blurring as it had no image stabilization.Secondly, the video was very poor which was expected at the time of purchase.Last, but not least the new canon has wide angle compared to the old olympus.I find that I take videos often now that I don't have to spend extra moneyfor a dedicated camcorder plus have to drag it around with me.My olympus only allowed zoom to 5x without shaking, now I can zoom to 10xor more without shake. Also, the older superzooms did not allow zooming whilein video mode. Zooming more than halfway requires good light and reallybracing myself especially when subjects are moving. I will purchase a tripod to increaseopportunities to take up to 20x zoom in those type situations. Also, I'm using automaticand scene modes so I have no idea what the full capabilities are in manual mode.

At least,when I look at an actual sized picture on my computer screen, it either showssome kind of slight graining or it looks soft (noise reduction?).

Also, action shots are sometimes good,but sometimes not the best but that's to be expected.There is a lady on the reviews that added links to her landscape images andthey really show you what beautiful pictures this camera takes in good light.I mean they are stunning. I have not learned how to apply manual settings soI'm sure that would make a lot of difference in image quality and that isanother benefit of this camera is that it allows you to manually change thesettings as you learn how.I had a hard time between this and the pana FZ-35 but the articulating screen,movie file type, battery type, and the odd joystick on the panasonic were the deciding factors.Plus, I didn't like how it felt in my hands. As far as low light pictures, my research tellsme that all the small sensor ultrazooms will have some difficulty unless you know how toadjust settings to compensate for it. If you don't mind using flash, it doesn't matter anyway.We really love our new camera and have been using it since Sept 2009. I amupset that all the camera makers have chosen not to include the more detailedmanuals as that means I have to print out 185 pages but that does not detractfrom how great the camera is. I'm having fun editing my movies frommy all around, does it all, and does it mostly great, canon sx20IS. Plus, I getto buy a dedicated flash and tripod to take full advantage of all the extra featuresand expand the capabilities of taking great shots in even more situations.

With 8 GB SD Card, I can get over an hour of video* Stabilization is better than I had with Canon S10* Excellent battery life with rechargeable batteries.  Energizer has good bateries that charge in 15 min* AA battery size which you can buy anywhere vs a proprietary battery which is more expensive.* 12 M pixel good for cropping* Fairly fast lens so it takes decent low light pictures if it focuses OK.Cons* No Manual but I printed it out double sided with 2 pages on a side = 45 sheets of paper.* As others mention focus in low light is tough. Sometimes you have to go to manual focus.* It has so many features; you need to study the manual to take advantage of all the bells and whistles.* While taking video, at times loses focus and correct exposure.* My view finder doesn't do a good job in displaying the picture I took.

I'm not sure how much I'll enjoy taking it along on all-day excursions.  On the plus side, it eliminates the need for an additional camcorder.  There is no good place to store the lens cap.  I lost it the first day after attaching it to the strap.  I'm going to replace it with one that has a leash.

The SX20 IS is much better than my old Camedia at lag time between depressing the button and the shutter going off, but it is still an issue with action and candid shots.When I downloaded the first couple dozen pictures I took, all taken on auto, I was disappointed that they were markedly less sharp than those of my Camedia, which my daughter used the same day under the same conditions.  Judging by the remarkably clear photos on the customer images, though, I figure I must just need to play with the settings some. The image stabilization worked well.

If they had included at least the superfine jpeg I may have tried the updated version as the camera has a ton of features and out of this world zoom!I really wanted to like this camera as I was hoping it would be a good bridge camera when I didn't want to drag my DSLR around. But, autofocus was indecisive/slow and the quality of the pictures was simply not good. There is no super fine compression/quality setting, only fine and normal, which leaves much to be desired in clarity, sharpness and low noise prints - even 4x6! You must lift the flash even in auto mode, and I was not able to ever make the flash engage even with changing every setting under the sun! Just by pulling it up didn't work (per the manual). There was no simple way to engage fill flash or flash for low light settings - sure, I could have gone to manual mode and compensated with exposure settings... but, is the average person going to do this? This is a nearly $400 camera - it should take nice, clear pictures in auto! If you are a fan of burst mode or want it for action shots, this camera will not perform well under those circumstances (1 shot per second is not fast, nor considered burst mode). The articulating LCD screen though is very nice and one of the reasons I purchased it. The HD video is also great though watch your settings, because the highest setting has lower frame per second rates and could end up looking choppy with/without a tripod). Also, keep in mind, you cannot use a filter without first purchasing a converter (not from Canon, they don't make them) and then buy a filter - then if you want a hood you will need to purchase a different one as your original will no longer fit.This could have been a great camera, as it has many great features, range and creative controls (no supported RAW though), but without good quality pictures it does not live up to the Canon name/quality for the price! (Maybe I got a bad one?) Anyway, as much as I wanted to keep it and continue working with it (the majority of reviews are great), I decided instead to buy a new walk around lense for my Canon T2i and just use that as I am almost always pleased with the outcome - great pictures!

CHDK stands for Canon Developers Hackers Kit and it provides a nondestructive means to restore lost functionality to this camera.  My sx20 is is now capable of ISO down to 30.  I can now save my pictures in RAW format and the SUPERFINE JPEG format has been restored.  Other treats include 1 minute exposures down to 1/68thousandth of a second(captures waterdrops)...a whole line of focal lenth calculators, zebramodes and histogram enhancements. ISO and F stop adjustments, Camera auto settings adjustments are available as well as augmented hyperfocal super macro settings.  Available scripts that allow motion trigger photo capture(read:lightning bolts and nocturnal animal shots) and computer remote photography is again available.  Adjustments to camera shake sensitivities are available. Fine adjustments to the flash are also available plus a whole lot more.  The sx20is electronics have so many capablities built into them but are kept locked away by sales considerations not actual machanical limits!  The software augments but does not rewrite firmware so when you replace the sd chip with chdk software on it with a blank, the camera firmware has not been touched or rewritten. The cdhk software acts as kind of a operating system that makes uses of Canon settings as well as its own.  So try the CHDK WIKI site before chucking your sx20is into the drink.PS.

The detail in distant telephoto shots is amazing, especially as compared to the former similar cameras I've owned.  Compared with my former super-zooms, there is also much less issue with chromatic aberration.  Really superb lens.The significant note I make is that anyone buying and using a DSLR or a camera such as the SX20IS with copious setup choices must really experiment with those various settings to make the camera function optimally the way they use it.  I took dozens of images in a variety of conditions and tinkered until I found the best settings for me.  It really makes a huge difference. Simply using Automatic doesn't cut it, and I'm so glad that Canon has engineered so many operational choices into the camera.  Customizing the camera setup greatly increased my satisfaction with it.Although it may be controversial, I'm pleased to use the \"i-Contrast\" dynamic range extender.  It works out great for me. While the exposure balance across an image may sometimes turn out noticeably unnatural, it has been far easier to correct for that later as opposed to my manually bringing out detail in selected excessively dark areas in a normally exposed picture.  The i-Contrast has turned out to be my favorite extra feature.  Dynamic range is a most important ongoing issue in photography, and this little tool provides major useful assistance with that.The video works well too.

The SX20 is rated at 20x optical zoom, 5-100, and 12.1 mp; it's gotta be better, right? I took a bunch of pix with both cameras side by side with the same settings in several locations, and I could not appreciate any better quality from the SX 20. The difference in zoom was not a big deal, it really did not seem to have 2x the zoom. The pictures with the 110 were actually bigger data files. The 110 takes images up to 3456 x 2592, and the SX20 takes images up to 3264 x 2448. Why does the 12.1mp camera take smaller pictures with less data than the 9.0mp camera? Either one is way overkill for viewing on a monitor, but if you want to crop the pix down, you want to start with a bigger image and bigger data file. The 110 takes as good as or better pix, has bigger data files, uses 2 AA batteries versus 4, and fits in a pocket. The SX20 is just big enough to make you hesitate to bring it along all the time. No matter how nice your camera, if you don't have it with you, you don't get any pictures.  The newer version of the 110 is the 120, which is rated at 10mp with the same 10x zoom. The 120 takes images up to 3648 x 2738, another step larger than the SX20 images, and it cost around $230 VS the SX20 at around $360. The 120 has a 3\" screen VS a 2.5 on the SX20. The image sensors, which are the true determinant of what you get for an image are almost exactly the same size. The 120 is 1/2.5, and the SX20 is just slightly bigger at 1/2.3, but again, the resolution on the SX20 is smaller, and the data file is smaller. I almost never return purchases but I sent the SX20 back. I already have a few perfectly good, old cameras sitting on the shelf. The only feature the SX20 has over the 120 is the articulating screen. On my 2nd and 3rd digital cameras I thought that was an important feature, but anymore it really doesn't matter for the pix I take. If you have small kids the moving screen will help you get pictures at their level. Otherwise, go for the smaller, cheaper, better SX120.The shutter to shutter speed might be slightly better with the SX20 since it has 4 batteries, but neither of these has a burst mode.

There is a mode that does take faster pics, but again when I use it, most pics come out blurry, so to give this camera an even better review I need to practice & use it more.I would recommend this camera to others.

I'm not doing this professionally or even really as a hobby. I just want good pics of my family and their activities.  So I tried to locate the A630, but Amazon wanted $70 more than what I paid for it 3 years ago.  NO.  So I found this camera at another store and looked at it before I bought it online.  It had the flip screen which  I love for taking different angled shots.  It had all the same buttons like portrait, custom color, color swap, indoors, foliage, fireworks, underwater, etc.  The zoom is amazing on this camera and I love that it isn't extremely huge.  I can still handle it pretty well.  The lens cap is kind of cheap, but it works.  I still have yet to mess with the camera and figure it all out, but I am so pleased with this camera.  I have been able to figure out the majority of the buttons because I already owned a Canon previously.  I just love Canon's.  They work well for someone like me who is looking for good quality family shots although I think its way better than a basic point and shoot camera.  The price also was a good buy.

It takes AA batteries so its easy to replace them when they die and you're on a mountain trail somewhere. I recommend 8 rechargeable batteries and a battery charger for people who don't mind charging them. It saves plenty of money in the long run. I started out using mine for college in photography and the teacher ALWAYS loved the way my pictures came out. I was a bit worried a few days ago for the first time when we got caught in pouring rain on a trail with no cover because I had no where to put my camera so it literally had plenty water running on it and through it (mainly the lens mechanics area which is probably the worst place it could get to). So when we got back I patted it down with a towel and put it in a plastic bag but forgot it in my car sitting in the condensation of the water I missed. Obviously it didn't work when I tried messing with it the next day but the battery area and the memory card area are both tight seals so they were perfectly dry and worked perfect. So I put it in my camera bag with the lens cap off and it not touching the wet strap thinking that I'd have to buy another one when I got home. Two days have passed, I took out my camera to see about the strap. I got curious and turned it on and it works PERFECTLY! This camera is extremely sturdy (though I don't recommend you try hurting it). It's an amazing camera for people who would like to take nice pictures in almost any lighting without needing too big of a camera like the really serious professionals have.

The 20x optical zoom is amazing! For those who don't know, that is the maximum distance the camera can zoom without losing image quality. The articulating LCD screen is also a very neat feature, it's extremely helpful being able to fold the screen in when not in use to protect it from scratches. I think this camera's strongest point is it's macro shots. Taking close up shots of flowers and other things have turned out amazing. It's macro and super macro settings are where this camera takes its best pictures. So whether or not you just want an inexpensive camera to take decent pictures when you go on vacation or you want to just start getting a feel for photography I'd say this is a great camera.

I wanted a camera that would take great shots but not have the weight and bulk of DSLR cameras and their multitude of lenses. This camera has not let me down. It has traveled with me from China to Korea to Uzbekistan taking amazing landscape photos and great people photos. It is quick and I have had several people comment on my pictures wondering what type of camera and lens combination I am using. It is still going strong to this day. One thing I have noticed - once in a while - a very very small part of the time - the focus won't work. Not sure why but I just turn the camera on and off for that 1 in 1000 times and the camera is back at it. If I was able to change one thing on this camera it would be the frame per second - I like taking sports shots and I would like this camera to be able to take more pictures (frames) per second. This is a minor limitation of the camera. I thought getting a faster memory card would help - but it made no difference. You can have the fastest card on the planet but if the camera does not write to it quick enough...This is a point and shoot camera with enough bells and whistles to play around with when you want to try different things. When I have pushed it to the limits - Chicago skyline at night, shooting from a moving car in Uzbekistan, this camera has responded very well.Is it a professional camera - no - but it has to be pretty close for what the majority of intermediate users would use it for.While I would like to go to a Canon T4i and get more involved with photography - I can't justify the replacing this camera as it works so well for what I need.

I love to use the wheel instead of actual buttons, especially while using the manual mode. The camera fits very comfortably in your hand, as it should. I think that the camera has a good weight to it, its not too heavy to where its uncomfortable but its not so light that it doesn't really feel like a camera. Another note:YES THIS CAMERA IS THREADED SO YES YOU CAN ATTACH FILTERS TO IT. I had such a hard time trying to figure this out before I bought the camera because some sources said the camera couldn't take any filters and others said that it could. I found out myself that yes the camera does take 52 mm filters. I have had this camera for several months now and I thoroughly enjoy using it. The zoom lens work very well; they are quiet, fast, and they focus very nicely from wide angle to telephoto. I have only had one issue with the camera and that is with the close-up and macro photography modes. I do a lot of close-up/macro work so I was a little disappointed by the lack of magnetic power the lens have. The focusing is wonderful, you could literally touch the lens and still have your finger in focus, but it is not magnified to see the details. To me, macro/close up photography is about seeing the great detail in things that the human eye cannot perceive. While this camera keeps everything crisp and sharp it just didn't give me the versatility I desired with close-up photography. However, one set of lens cannot do it all so I don't really consider this too much of a fault. I just went ahead and bought macro filters and was happy again.  As far as night scenes are concerned, the longest shutter speed for this camera is 15 seconds. I have found that this is good enough to cover most generic nigh scenes. If you want a longer exposure or you do lots of night/low light photography then your better off getting another camera, probably an actual DSLR. The 3200 ISO on this camera isn't anything to be impressed with because the image quality is pretty bad. The ISO 1600 image quality is OKAY. I would say 800 and below are pretty good. Because this isn't a true DSLR camera don't expect DSlR image quality. The quality of the images are very atractive, but for the best quality possible you're going to have to put more money into a better camera.  From my several month's of experience with this camera I can honestly say I love it. It fulfills my needs very well, it's reliable, and its durable. The battery life is wonderful. If you are looking for a great camera at a great value then you can just stop right here. However, if you are looking for pristine, professional studio quality images then you will want to get an actual SLR.

After receiving the camera and having taken less than 100 pictures with it, I can say that the COLOR is MUCH BETTER than previous cameras that I have owned, HOWEVER, some of the photographs are NOT SHARP, as if it didn't get a chance to focus the camera.  Unlike the SONY, I cannot turn the image stabilizer on or off - - it's just there working in the background (I hope).The one disappointment that I have is that I cannot turn the flash ON to flash all the time (fill-in flash).  There may be a way of doing that, but I haven't learned it yet.For those who complained about the shadow created when the flash is used with the sun-shade on the lens, let me  offer this suggestion:  REVERSE the sun-shade on the lens, and ONLY turn it around to be used as a SUN SHADE when taking pictures in full sunlight.  That way it also fits into the camera case easierOver-all, I am glad that I bought the camera and it works perfectly with my iMac:  in fact I have LESS correction to do using iPhoto, than when using my Sony.UPDATE:  After 4-months of use, I can now give this camera 5-stars.

Outdoor pictures are OK as far as there is no sharp difference between shade and sunlight. On a sunny day it is too difficult to take scenic picture with some what blue sky and shady hills. Either hills goes too dark or sky goes too white, depends which one you focus first.  FYI! I tried both with Auto Contrast on and off modes. I think probably the worst design flaw is that you cannot use external filters, there is no thread for  filters or filter adapter.  It is however blessing that \"Janco \" has come up with an alternative adapter, some what workaround.The camera takes outstanding stunning picture in Program mode.

It is now October 14, 2010 and this camera is developing problems already...When I first got this camera, I was blown away by the quality of the pictures.  But after using it for six months I have begun to notice things about its performance that aren't so attractive, and a very serious problem with this camera has developed.First, the problem...  I am unsure when it started, but about a month after getting this camera I noticed a white pixel when taking pics zoomed at 80X.  I didn't think it was a big deal at the time because I rarely zoom that far.  But last night and tonight I have been taking pics of the moon, and I noticed that the pixel is now visible even when not zooming at all.  It is showing up in ALL of my pics, no matter how it is zoomed.  I bought this camera based on the quality of an old Canon Rebel G SLR I've been having for 12 -years-.  Now, after six -months-, this digital camera is beginning to crap out on me.  That is a bit ridiculous.Also, this camera takes horrible night pictures.  I am mainly using it for experimenting with astrophotography and I am beginning to see that regardless of Canon's claims, this is NOT the camera for low-light photos.  Even in some normally lit photos, dark objects will be very grainy with black and dark gray artifacts throughout the dark objects.  Night photos are almost impossible to get without grain.  When I take moon photos, I have to heavily manipulate the brightness and contrast afterward to get rid of the overwhelming noise and grain in the photo.The autofocus is another issue that might trouble some people.  Some light conditions are impossible for the autofocus (such as a full moon when zoomed in 80X).  This would not be a problem for me since sky shots require you to focus on infinity, but focusing on infinity doesn't quite focus the shot either.  Manual focus works fairly well, but it is still hard to tell if your shot is actually focused when looking at a small LCD screen.  Many times, I have taken a shot I thought was focused only to find out once I loaded it onto my laptop that it wasn't focused at all.There are a lot of small things like this that plague this camera, but I feel like I am beginning to rant.  I will just stop here and say that this is a nice camera at first, but apparently Canon has forgotten how to build quality.  The burned out pixel(s) are the deal breaker for me.

Still pix so far are sharp and well exposed. I have not shot videos yet. My peeves: the lens cap comes off too easily and is not attached to the camera. That's a lost item waiting to happen. I know DSLRs don't attach them but they are not so easily dislodged. Going from viewing pix back to taking pix has to pass through a shut down step. Why? My DSLR doesn't force that choice. Maybe I need more training. These super zooms compromise pix quality with  extra long lenses and high pixel counts. I'd rather have less lens and a larger sensor to improve quality but this S20 is better than its predecessors. Flash power: This one really needs an external flash to gain meaningful distance so thanks for the hot shoe.  With the lens shade installed, any flash picture shot at the widest angle and with the pop-up flash gets that shade shadow \"nose\" in the bottom of the picture. It's a nuisance to remove the shade for indoors and replace it for outdoors. Just make a shade where the flash shadow doesn't happen or raise the flash a bit more.  I know - use an external flash or avoid that setting.  Those are undesirable, but apparently necessary compromises. Again, no such problems with my DSLR. Also the lens shade twists off way too easily. Some of buttons on the back are a bit close together for my fat thumb so I sometimes make commands I didn't want to make.  More training. These are little issues for which there are some fixes and some learning that provide solutions. Overall the camera provides a one-box mix of all the most important camera features, especially when considering packing small for travel. It was a good choice for that reason alone.

Comparing it to the Sony DSC-H10 that I have at home, I really don't like the Cannon.  Here's why:-The lens cap doesn't have a cord to connect it to the camera.  You have to keep track of it or you'll lose it.-The camera is really heavy.  It takes 4 AA batteries and the batteries alone make the camera heavy.  (My Sony is MUCH lighter with the one rechargeable battery.)-The Duracell batteries that I use don't last very long.  I use the large screen to take pictures and while I know this takes more battery juice than if I used the viewfinder, I feel like the battery life is really low. I don't even want to think about how much money I've spent in batteries this past year.-It isn't a one button deal to over-ride the automatic flash.  There are times when the flash doesn't go off and I want it to and it it's a several button process to get the flash to go.-There is a fairly substantial delay in the time it takes between taking a picture and being able to take another one.-With all Canon cameras you need to install software on your computer in order to view and download photos.  Again, with a Sony, this isn't the case.

I purchased my SX20 Canon Factory Refurbished - for $300.  (I saved $80.00 or more.) It looks and performs as if new.  Even $400.00  is a great price.  I paid a lot more for my T2i SLR and it doesn't have an articulating LCD.-Comparing the quality of my XS20 images with the T2i, there really is only small differences in sharpness.  At least with most of my enlargements.  This is surprising to me because of the difference in image sensor size, and the remarkable zoom range of the lens being 18X.  All this and with a rather fast maximum aperture of f2.8.  SLR's have no lenses that compare with this range, and the big zoom lenses that fit the SLR's are much heavier.Mostly I don't use the LCD view screen.  The viewfinder is faster.  But I will use it when photographing plants.  And we all know other uses for the articulating LCD - shooting over heads - getting down to child level - etc.I appreciate the small size, easy handling, and the light weight of this camera. Also, when I'm unsure of what settings to use, I can quickly set the XS20 on Intelligent Auto mode.  All this makes it tempting to leave my Rebel T2i at home when the SX20 will do the job.  See my photo postings at the top of this advertisement.Only two things bother me about the SX20:  (1) It doesn't record photographs in RAW format, and (2), Regular and Burst setting modes are slow. This is not a fast action camera.I can't think of anything else that bothers me about the SX20.  Again, I give it FIVE-STARS for price, utility, image sharpness, and ease of handling.  Even if I were a pro I would want to own one and put it to use8/26/11 UPDATE:I forgot to mention the AA NiMH Batteries.  I would have much preferred lithium.  The rechargeable AA batteries have a shelf life of about five years, and don't hold a charge.  They get progressively weaker faster, MUCH FASTER, than Lithium batteries.  And Alkaline AA's are not cost effective.  Lithium batteries hold more energy and stay charged for months.  Almost all other digital cameras are now powered by lithium batteries.Another thing I forgot to mention, the SX20 has a Hot-Shoe and will work with Canon Speedlites and many other brands.  This is a big plus.However, while I still think this is a great camera for semi-serious photo bugs, I'm changing my rating from 5-STARS to 4-STARS, and my EXCELLENT to ALMOST EXCELLENT.", "Date": "July 20, 2011"}, {"Title": "Excellent!", "Author": "Patrick J.

It was then that I sought out the manual, only to find it missing.  Wading through the online manual was an aggravation that I simply did not want to hassle with, especially when I had work that needed to be done.What if I hadn't been near my computer when I had some question about the camera's function?  Tough luck, I guess.Bottom line, this is not a camera for a novice and I would not recommend it to anyone.  Heck, even if you're not new to digital cameras or photography, you still need to know how to use specific functions on a new camera.  It is absurd to think that you must sit in front of your computer and learn, rather than take the camera into the real world and learn as you go.", "Date": "November 20, 2009"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": "Unavailable", "Features": "High-powered 20x wide-angle optical zoom with Optical Image Stabilizer\nCapture 720p HD movies with stereo sound; HDMI output connector for easy playback on your HDTV\n2.5-inch Vari-Angle System LCD; improved Smart AUTO intelligently selects from 22 predefined shooting situations\nDIGIC 4 Image Processor; 12.1-megapixel resolution for poster-size, photo-quality prints\nPowered by AA batteries (included); capture images to SD/SDHC memory cards (not included)", "Name": "Canon PowerShot SX20IS 12.1MP Digital Camera with 20x Wide Angle Optical Image Stabilized Zoom and 2.5-Inch Articulating LCD", "ImgURL": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/516hZV9JkBL._SX300_.jpg", "ProductID": "B002LITT3I"}}
