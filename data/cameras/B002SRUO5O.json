Needed a tiny screw driver that was not included.....We bought this camera for our daughters 9th birthday present yesterday. We went bowling and my daughter wanted to take pictures with her new camera.  Its looks great except we couldn't open the battery section! There is a tiny screw on the battery section.  When we got home we looked high and low for a tiny screw driver and no luck, this looks like something a jewelry store may have.  I called the costumer service at 877-397-8200 and they ask for all my information regarding this item. I told them I was having problems opening the battery section due to a screw being there.  The representative told me to press down and open it.  I told her the purpose of my calling is because I can't open it with the screw being there. I find it annoying the they don't know their products. Then she told me to go back to ToyRus, which is about 20 miles away and ask them to open it. I hope it works.We ended up returning it back to the school because it was too much trouble to open the back.  Next time we will just get her a regular camera.", "Date": "February 14, 2010"}, {"Title": "Cute little camera...huge disappointment.", "Author": "Wendy Chapman", "ReviewID": "R3AQJ23C437IKW", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "Flimsy construction.  No view window on the back.  Can't upload pictures - my computer won't recognize the device.  I thought it was such a great idea to get my 11 year old a digital camera that had all these extras and that was associated with iCarly (whom she loves).  This \"gift from Santa\" has been such a disappointment.  We've uninstalled and reinstalled the software and tried everything.  No pictures.
