Colour matches the bodyWhat spoils it for me are the gold-plated buckles and rings on the strapsA few girls have broken their nails trying to screw the cradle onto the body. The trick is to use the buckle, which doubles as a screwdriverCamera's a bit smaller than a credit cardDOWNSIDE:Clock's irritating, you choose the time-zone by navigation a world map. I failed geographyThe built-in memory sucks - less than 10 ahots if you want high qualityDelete button is hiddenNo spot meteringHard to turn on the flash - you have to get into the menuUPSIDE:Quality rather goodReally smallEV +/- but the control's a bit trickyControl over ISO and WB but it's under 'Quality' rather than 'Record'ARGUABLE:IT uses a joystick, so instead of stabbing at the button and ruining the manicure, you slide the button downIdea's ok but can be a bit dodgy - guess shooting pictures of what you had for lunch is a bit different from street photogADDITION:IF you set the (sound) silent mode to on, then you cdannot control the flash.So what you have to do is select 'off' for silent mode. (This means the camera is not in silent mode - strange way to say things)Then go through the whole sound menu which includes 'shutter', 'half shutter', 'start-up', 'playback'.Individually select silent or off for each.Only in this way can you control the flash and timer.If you select 'On' for Silent mode, then either the flash will always fire, or you can't turn it on.Same applies for self-timer.Confusing, I know.", "Date": "January 24, 2013"}, {"Title": "WHY no silent mode for Timer & Flash?", "Author": "Irene", "ReviewID": "R2FVHNLAT4PWUY", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "The reason why I only buy Casio cameras is because of the 3x shot timer, otherwise I would have switched to another brand a LONG time ago.  So I was delighted to find it with a removable \"jacket\".I love everything about this camera- the size, the look, the feel, and the girly strap (I got the one in black, so it's not in your face girly so quite reasonable).  BUT, it is not possible to put it on silent mode for the timer and flash, which are critical functions.  So the camera's annoyingly beeping every time you push the button.  The previous reviewer also mentioned this, but I didn't think the beep would be so critical and really so unavoidable.  Awful.But as long as Casio keeps their 3x shot timer, I will continue to be a repeat customer.  I'm on my 3rd Casio camera now, and this has had the best look-and feel so far.  But the BEEP!!
