Well the voltage in the US is 120 NOT 250! This is so stupid. Horrible seller because this information is not at all indicated in the discription of the item, even SOny doesnt know how this happened.  Why would you ship such an item to the US????", "Date": "June 28, 2013"}, {"Title": "Just LOVE this camera!", "Author": "Sabrina Sierra Morales", "ReviewID": "R30QXB1AROJBS2", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Makes perfect pictures even in low light!
