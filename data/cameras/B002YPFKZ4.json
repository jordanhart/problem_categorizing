{"Reviews": [{"Title": "The underdog of camera manufacturers continues to impress", "Author": "Ravicai", "ReviewID": "R39BLB42U7M6BD", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Great camera from an underrated company. Slickdeals briefly had this camera up for 250, so I scored it through them (sorry Amazon).Pros:- Amazing set of features that rival many DSLRs.- Powerful flash! I've got some great pics of 20 people on a long banquet table in a dark restaurant. All faces are clear!- 20x zoom!- Slow motion video is very handy. 120fps 640x480 is perfect for most tasks like examining golf swings, martial arts technique, tennis swing, etc.- Both 3\" LCD and digital viewfinder.- Built-in HDR like capabilities with 'best shot' where the camera will take multiple shots and combine the best aspects of each into one photo.- 40fps shots at 9mp over .7 secs. 5fps if using flash.- Shutter speed adjustable from 30 seconds to 1/2000. Great for meteor showers.Cons:- Flash is sometimes overpowering and can wash out photos.- Construction is almost completely plastic, causing me to worry about long-term durability. Get a case!- Camera can zoom while recording video in both 720p and 640x480, however when you have zoom enabled it disables the microphone. This leads me to believe that Casio couldn't figure out how to eliminate the gear noise. Doh! If you want the mic to stay on then; 1) disable the 'zoom while recording', 2) set your zoom level BEFORE you begin recording, and 3) record. You'll be stuck at whatever zoom level you set, but at least you'll have audio.- No audio while taking slow motion video.Overall:I've owned a Casio watch and a Casio calculator, but who would have thought they make great cameras? Give this one a try. It is a solid camera that has tons of features for a very reasonable price.Technical Note: I used a SanDisk Extreme III 8gb SDHC card. With the memory card inserted the camera took forever to power up (upwards to 8-10 secs). I reformatted it using the software found at sdcard.org and now it powers on in 3 secs.", "Date": "May 18, 2010"}, {"Title": "Better Than Similar Canon Megazoom", "Author": "Joel Myron", "ReviewID": "RR6BCM4A8PEX5", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I am a non-novice, non-expert Grampa who takes thousands of pictures and videos of his grandchildren.  I have had the Canon SX2 IS (12x optical) and upgraded to the Canon SX10 IS (20x optical).  Both are great cameras with great quality pictures.  But both are slow and don't work nearly as fast as my old Nike 8008 35 milimeter camera.  The Casio EX-FH25, although not as fast as the old Nike 8008, is clearly fast enough to get my grandchildren playing soccer and even doing rides.  The picture quality is absurd and it is as good in low light as the Canon megazooms are.  I have also used the Sony Megazoom line and the Casio is far better, just as it is far better than the Canons.  I am amazed at the quality of the videos and the photos on the Casio.If there is a weakness, it's that in HD video mode, one can't use the zoom, although one can use the zoom in Standard Definition video mode.The Casio is a superb camera, better than similarly priced cameras of better known camera producers, and the Canon and Sony megazooms are excellent, though not nearly as good as the Casio because of the Casio's speed and picture quality.", "Date": "May 17, 2010"}, {"Title": "So far, so good", "Author": "David P. Rosenmarkle", "ReviewID": "R15SXGTDV5C2O6", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I'm not a camera expert, so I need something that takes the guesswork out of shooting pictures. Took it to a family reunion and came back with a host of shots ready for an album or future blackmail. Took a lot of interior shots that the automatic flash sensor did not use the flash and, most turned out just fine. I stepped up for the 16GB high performance memory card and believe that contributed to the photo quality. So far, I'm very pleased with the ease of operation and look forward to learning other options for taking photos. The multiple frames per second is a real hoot. Got some interesting pics I would not have achieved with a regular SLR. Well worth the competitive price currently offered. Does more than many cameras costing $200 to $400 more.", "Date": "September 5, 2010"}, {"Title": "Complex But Worth The Effort To Learn", "Author": "Mark Baum", "ReviewID": "R160LB6GT82UZG", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "The once-separate product lines of digital video recorders (DVR) and still cameras has been merging to the point that one camera can be able to do most tasks. The Casio EX-FH25 Exilim shows how such a camera can merge the best of both technologies.Granted, it's very tough to mess up basic DVR. I have thumb-sized cameras that take solid DVD-quality video and stored on a MicroSD card. Its with that in mind that one of the main selling points of this camera is its high-speed video recording that allows for slow motion shots for extra detail. The quality is good for VGA 640x480 at 120fps. However, to achieve the maximum of 1000fps the resolution is dropped down to 224x64. So this isn't going to replace far more specialized high-speed cameras but it does give anyone with a meager budget something new to play with. For non-high speed video it takes both DVD and HD at 30fps at full resolutions.As for the stills it has many tricks as well. The Best Shot feature takes a bunch of photos then uses image correction to give a decent picture. It can also easily handle rapid-fire photos for action scenes, the plus being that all the shots are grouped together for better organizing. The 20x optical zoom is certainly a plus for more detail for distant shots. It's also good with night scenes where the longer exposure settings plus the Best Shot feature can help reduce light trails from hand or other motion. For better \"night vision\" it does have a green LED lamp that briefly lights up for illumination to help set the light level and exposure time. Another nice touch is that, when it powers down, it saves the current zoom and focus setting of the optics. Power it back up and it resumes where it was without the need to reframe the shot.But there is a price for the versatility of this camera: Its menus and features are quite more advanced when compared to my venerable Nikon Coolpix L5. So be prepared to have to deal with cumbersome menus and a not-so-intuitive interface. You will want to take the time in experimenting with the camera before taking serious video or stills. Once past that the many options can be tweaked to allow you more control over the final shots. Its closer to a professional-grade camera than a typical point-and-shoot.The rest is standard stuff: It uses four AA batteries as its power source (you can use NiMH rechargeable batteries). It has an SDHC SD card slot which works quite well with high-speed professional flash cards. And it even has a separate viewfinder for those times where you want to shoot but don't want to distract others by the large backlit LCD screen. It has the usual USB/AV connector as well as a DC 9V input jack for external power.I've had the camera for a couple weeks so far and it works quite well. But I wouldn't recommend it for novices. Once you learn how it works you'll be amazed by what shots you can capture. For what it does it's definitely something more along the lines of professional gear but without the price tag. It's for people who want to play with high-speed video while also taking some very good video and stills.", "Date": "November 17, 2010"}, {"Title": "Nice upgrade from past Exilim", "Author": "Eric Laffoon \"ubergeek\"", "ReviewID": "R3I08HA3VQ54P5", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Six years ago in Spain I saw a guy taking 640x480 video on a credit card size camera. I was blown away and shortly got my first Exilim. Now my Android phone takes incredible pictures and 720p video and I have a 1080p pocket video Samsung with stereo audio. I rarely use my Exilim EX-Z1080 any more. Last year I submitted a photo for one of my products to get free mention in a national publication. They rejected the photo as it wasn't clear enough. I tried again and the second rejection missed the deadline. Since then I have had a friend show product images with their DSLR. Meanwhile shooting cat pictures seems always to be an issue of timing.I've only had this camera for a week and barely scratched the surface but I loved Best Shot in previous cameras and it's here too. It's hard to find anything to complain about with this camera, but one is that the printed material is a crappy quick start and to really understand how to get the most out of it you need to read the included PDF. I'm also not wild about it using AA batteries, but then Exilim sips power and I am willing to accept this reality. On the plus side it is not only cheaper than a DSLR but it will snap pictures at an unheard of rate. I have yet to try slo-mo video but it is an exciting feature. Video recording is okay and 720p looks great on HD. As good TVs upscale it's not a big loss that it doesn't do 1080p.What this camera does well though is turn on quick and deliver amazing pictures. Cell Phone cameras are getting better, but I remember using a BlackBerry 9700 and dealing with lag making me lose the shot I wanted. Even in regular shooting mode this thing is fast! I got a 16 GB class 10 card, something I only recently even saw, just to be sure I could use the speed. The 20x zoom, macro and auto focus are amazing. I can't compare this to DSLRs costing hundreds more but I can say it takes amazing pictures. The clarity and color are so striking it feels like a new realm for digital photography, like some secret ingredient in the perfect picture. Of course I'm sure there are a number of internal factors, but the lense clearly is a huge difference. No compact camera or cell phone can fully compensate for lack of a good lense.Unless you are a professional or need technical points to lord over people you can just show the pictures and watch all but the pros gasp in awe. This camera is in a class by it's self overlapping the two main classes. If you are an Exilim owner thinking that you no longer need an Exilim Casio has got something to keep you coming back. It's not how many pixels your phone has or how much your snob lense costs... it's how good your picture looks. It's hard to beat this camera.", "Date": "August 16, 2010"}, {"Title": "Casio compared to Panasonic FZ100 for High Speed video and stills", "Author": "Amazon Customer", "ReviewID": "R2QR1ANMK26CET", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I had a week with the Casio EX-FH25 before a defective part took it down.  Unfortunately, a few got out of the factory with defective memory chips and it would keep losing the setup and date.  Also had the lense freeze fully extended because of the same defect.  That was the bad part and the reason the camera only got 4 stars from me.  While it was working, it was a five star product.What I wanted a new camera for is analyzing tennis strokes and matches for high performance juniors that I coach.  The Casio is the only one that I tried that could really deliver the goods.  A key difference between the Casio and the competition from Nikon and Panasonic was a reasonable resolution of 432 x 320 when recording video at 240fps.  After I returned the unit to the Amazon vendor I bought it from (more on that below) I decided to try the Panasonic FZ100Panasonic Lumix DMC-FZ100 14.1 MP Digital Camera with 24x Optical Image Stabilized Zoom and 3.0-Inch LCD (Black).  What a let down. It was $100 more expensive, supposedly had higher resolution, and claimed to deliver some of the same high speed options.  The Casio was vastly superior in all aspects of IQ to the Panasonic.  The Casio FH25 offers a wider range of high speed video options to provide slo-mo and it has higher resolution than the Pana FZ100 at all of them.  The Casio FH25 provided usable videos that could be blown up to full screen at 240fps.  You could see the racquet meet the ball in a serve.  When I tried to take the exact same video with the Panasonic FZ100 at 240fps, you couldn't see the ball for all the pixelization -- the FZ100 had lower resolution (320x240)and no IQ at all. In fact, the Pana FZ100 had terrible IQ in all video modes.The HD pictures I took with the Casio while it worked were of good to great IQ, the videos were fairly clear and didn't have the \"jello jigglies\" that the Panasonic did.I returned the Panasonic to Amazon and will go back to a Casio as soon as I can order it directly from Amazon.I had ordered the Casio from Cameta Camera via Amazon. That was a mistake!  Their delivery was good and the price was fair, BUT when I discovered that the camera was defective I was reminded of why I never buy anything that isn't shipped directly from Amazon warehouses.  They made me pay to return the camera . . . when I complained they offered to pay $6 of the shipping costs (which were over $18).  I told them I wanted a full refund as I was not going deal with someone that didn't stand behind their products.  Then they sent me an email offering to pay $12 of the shipping costs if I would give them a good review.  I told them to keep the extra $6 as my reviews couldn't be bought.  They have yet to refund the $6.", "Date": "January 12, 2011"}, {"Title": "Really Neat Slow Motion (High Speed) Camera", "Author": "C", "ReviewID": "R23Q59CWBF9ZCI", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This [unique?] Casio camera is a remarkable value.  With shipping it cost around $300.  It takes surprisingly good video at 240 frames per second (up to about 4 minutes of video at a time) which is plenty good for many physical phenomena (water splashing, bird wings flapping, cars crashing), is easy to use (including editing the video) and has a reasonable zoom range.  I can't think of a single complaint about it after using it for various technological projects over the last month.  It can replace cameras costing tens of thousands of dollars for many scientific and technological purposes where exceptional high speed video quality is not necessary.", "Date": "February 5, 2011"}, {"Title": "Great for filming golf swings", "Author": "Bradley Conte", "ReviewID": "R12855K5SVD5FB", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I use this camera to film my golf swing. I've found the best image settings to be 240 FPS and 1/4000 shutter speed. It provides enough resolution to see details on clubface orientation and shaft profile and shows a ~90mph driver swing in 2-3 inch movement increments of the clubhead. If you need to see the clubhead in detail through impact, 420 FPS will work well.This model is widely used to film golf swings, and it does so very well. The settings on the camera are fairly detailed and allow you to tailer the camera how you want to. The aperture, shutter speed, and framerate, are all independently adjustable.The aperture range seems a little bit limited, but it's not an issue outdoors. So one small disadvantage is that good lighting is a must for this camera. Filming at high speed (eg, with the above settings) indoors produces a very, very dark image that is difficult to use. Outdoors in bright sunlight works well, although you can get a reasonably decent image quality until dusk so long as the shadows aren't in the way and the sun is still on the target. This is likely to be a problem with any camera at such speeds, though.Slow motion video takes up a lot of space, however. A 10-15 minute video can produce (depending on the settings) a 1 to 3 GB file. If you're going to use this camera for high speed video, get a high capacity memory card with fast write speeds and remove old files regularly. I got a card from Amazon titled \"PNY Professional 16 GB Class 10 Hi-Speed SDHC 20MB/s 133x\" (specs obvious from the product title), and it works well.", "Date": "May 27, 2011"}, {"Title": "Great slow motion pics", "Author": "Gary Monaghan", "ReviewID": "R23ATI2UFJMNN9", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "It takes clear crisp pictures, but I really bought it for slow motion video of my golf swing and it does that very well!", "Date": "January 29, 2014"}, {"Title": "Truly Great Slow-Mo Camera, Truly Great Price", "Author": "AveryCloseCall \"Avery\"", "ReviewID": "R1SZYNP0QH74FM", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This camera is so awesome that it's worth more used than I paid for it.

This is not a camera for novices. Occasionally I get really nice shots, but more often they come out blurry and/or grainy. I bought it because it seemed to have some DSLR-like features and at the time was selling for less than the entry level DSLRs on the market. I paid close to $300 for it. I can't believe the current asking price for this camera. To see all the high reviews (one the the reasons I bought it), I have to wonder if I got a dud. The image quality from this camera has been inconsistent almost since I got it. Admittedly, I'm not an expert user but even with the auto settings I have problems. The auto-focus on doesn't seem to work for me at least half of the time and I often end up with completely unusable images. I've seen more consistent, clear images come from less expensive digital point and shoots than I get with this camera. When I occasionally get a really nice shot I can't tell what I've done differently than at any other time. Its saving grace for me is the video mode. I will keep it for that but i'm tired of missing great shots of my nearly 2 year old son because the image is too blurry. I'll be shopping for a point and shoot until I have enough to buy a good DSLR.
