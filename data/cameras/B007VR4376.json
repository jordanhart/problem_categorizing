{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Excellent way to stabilize your handheld camera.", "Author": "Jerry Saperstein", "ReviewID": "R5UU7VUVAC6VQ", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "What makes this grip very special is the horizontal platform that runs parallel to your camera. It provides much greater stability than the older hand-grips made for older style video cameras or those handles that attach by a single screw.  The grip itself is very well made and fits nicely in my somewhat large hands. It provides a very solid feeling.  There's a 1/4-20 socket on the bottom which will accommodate the included lanyard holder. More creatively, you can use another handle with a P&C; Pico Dolly 11\" Articulating Arm to mount LED panels, microphones and other accessories.  This kind of setup turns even the smallest video capable digital camera, smart phone or up to intermediate DSLRs into a very stable camera platform. One blogger suggests adding a small tabletop tripod to the end of an arm to make into a shoulder stabilized mount.  This is a really nicely designed and well-made accessory and extremely useful.Jerry", "Date": "October 1, 2012"}, {"Title": "Step Up From BARSKA AccuGrip", "Author": "JoeD Freelance Pro Photographer & Blogger \"| ...", "ReviewID": "R3MUEWA5ALNV3C", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I previously reviewed the slightly less expensive BARSKA Accu Grip Handheld Tripod System and rated that item 5 stars for my specific non-DSLR application. The BARSKA was rated in the context not of DSLR use, but of creating a handheld \"Speedlight Gun\" similiar to the Lastolite LL LU2125 Brolly Grip, which I also rated and found lacking in many ways. However, I decided to also purchase this pistol grip based on the horizontal platform in case I needed it for DSLR use as well.  I was not disappointed.There are two major differences between this item and the BARSKA Accu Grip:\u261b  Grip handle is bigger\u261b  The horizontal platformThe grip arrived in a blister retail pack.  I found the build quality very similiar to the BARSKA in that construction is very solid, reminding me of the pistol grip on some handguns. The material feels as if it's made from the same plastic as Glock handguns. A noticeable difference in build quality is that this pistol grip is assembled with screws whereas the BARSKA handle appears to be glued together. The handle on this grip is definitely bigger and for my hands easier to hold. However, I really do not see a problem for smaller hands.  Unlike the BARSKA, this grip comes with a 1/4-20 threaded screw that holds a D-ring on the bottom (both have the 1/4-20 socket at the bottom).  This allows you to clip it to a carabiner on your bag for example and is easily removed if you need to use the socket to mount to a tripod. The ring will also allow you to hang (in my case) an unattended flash with minimum fuss and the build strength provides confidence in that regard. The horizontal platform and 1/4-20 threaded screw work good for mounting a DSLR and provide greater contact, leading to better stability, with the DSLR than the BARSKA.  The screw is of proper length for a flush mount.  However, the rubber mounting on the platform leaves a little to be desired and I found it necessary to glue it down (but, I am OCD). The grip fits nicely in any of my camera bags and is one of those items that can utlize odd empty spaces you often see left over in camera bags.When using this specific pistol grip with in a \"Speedlight gun\" configuration, I found that due to the horizontal platform, I could not mount a PocketWizard MiniTT1 Radio Transmitter for Nikon TTL Flashes and Digital SLR Cameras directly to the platform because the shoe of the PocketWizard was in the way.  Instead, I had to first mount a Nikon AS-21 Speedlight Stand for SB-910 and SB900 AF Speedlights and then mount the PocketWizard.  No big deal really and it worked quite well.  From there, I mount the flash.  I have tried a number of umbrella brackets, but they all make the setup unstable.  I am looking for an alternative solution.\u2714 Choosing between the two grips comes down not to a choice of quality, but a choice of need. Either one will work fine for making a \"speedlight Gun.\"  If I was mounting a DSLR, I would choose the Photography & Cinema Handheld Pistol Grip Handle For DSLR's, Point-n-Shoot & Video Cameras - D-Ring Included.", "Date": "May 8, 2013"}, {"Title": "Works on almost any camera or video camera", "Author": "Mark C. \"Pentax Cameras\"", "ReviewID": "R3NO71D0S2T9L4", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Universal threading allows this to work on most devices.
