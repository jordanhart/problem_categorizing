{"Reviews": [{"Title": "What an incredible system!", "Author": "Josh Adams, \"Rock Crushes Paper\"", "ReviewID": "R3U2MMRVEEUW02", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Background: I have used the same 1000 watt 5.1 system from Samsung for nearly four years.  About two years ago I added the Formula F-12 subwoofer.  If you're in the market for a mid-range sub, the F-12 is a STEAL.  Long story short, the Samsung system was good for a small room, but quickly lost any punch or \"theatre experience\" once it was moved into a larger space.  I needed something to fill a larger room that is approximately 20'X30'. In replacing the system, I went with the following equipment:Sony STRDH-830 7.1 RecieverSony SS-CN5000 Center ChannelSony SS-F5000 Floor Standing Speakers (Left and Right front)Formula F-12 Subwoofer (475 watt)Sony SS-B3000 Bookshelf Speakers X 4Media Bridge HDMI'sIn the past I have had friends who have spent over twice what I have on a home theater system, but in comparison I'm getting much deeper lows, clear midrange, and crystal clear highs than I've heard out of their Yamaha, Denon, and others.I'm not an audiophile by any means, but I appreciate what I hear.  Here's a very simple pro/con look at the STRDH-830:PROS:- Only 1 HDMI connection needed to run to my display.  Any connected equipment that is displaying less than 1080P is automatically upconverted.- The included microphone autobalanced all speakers to my room in less than 10 seconds.- Everything feels quality, heavy.- The available sound fields to choose from are many, and all are distinctly different.- 3D compatibility is a plus, although I have yet to use it.- Documentation with the unit is clear and easy to understand.- Inputs are reassignable to other sources.  (For example, I assigned one of the composite video channels to the optical audio.)- The 2 Channel Simulated surround sound for smaller setups is KILLER! It works surprisingly well.CONS:- The remote is needlessly confusing and bloated.- The GUI can be be frustrating, unintuitive, and unforgiving to learn.- Although the unit has 5 HDMI ins, component inputs, composite input, you can only use 5 input types at anytime.- Can be a bit expensive when compared to the other 7.1 systems Sony has available, but new tech always is.Bottom Line:  I saved a few bucks to get this receiver over the others Sony has, and am very pleased with my purchase.  There are a few things like I mentioned above that can be frustrating, but that's when I turn my system up louder and melt into my seat!  Every system has flaws, but for the price and the result I can't give this any less than 5 stars.[Edit] After some continued usage I'm still very pleased with the STRDH830.  But I do have two important things to note.  First, the receiver is capable of pumping out 140 watts of power to each of the 7 channels.  In comparison to other units like the Yamaha RX V671 that only puts out 90 watts of power per channel (http://www.amazon.com/Yamaha-RX-V671-7-1-Channel-Network-Receiver/dp/B004QR56SE/ref=sr_1_1?s=electronics&ie;=UTF8&qid;=1336582481&sr;=1-1), you are getting a much more powerful setup for your home theater here with Sony, for much less dough.The auto-calibration that the system provides is amazing.  It detects the size of the speakers used, locations, power, etc.  The auto-calibration will NOT set certain preferences automatically, so don't expect the calibration to pick up on your personal tastes.  After the calibration I selected \"Dynamic\" in my surround settings to make up for the poor acoustics in my room and bring a more theater-like experience.  I was blown away by the difference once I found this option.  (It took me a week to discover this though)The last thing I'd like to mention is the horrendous USB interface for playing music.  If you are planning on playing music from an iPhone/Pod/Pad or any other MP3 source, do yourself a favor and just buy a 1/8\" to RCA cable and control your music through the music device and NOT the receiver.  The GUI interface for USB music is slow, clunky, and annoying if you have more than 6 artists or albums to scroll through.I can't recommend this purchase enough if you are tired of dealing with weak \"Home Theater Packages\" and want a real audial experience.", "Date": "May 4, 2012"}, {"Title": "Great clear sound", "Author": "Gadgets on a budget", "ReviewID": "R1RS2908NQ6ZB7", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I had a pioneer vsx-820k that failed and best buy let me choose a replacement so I got this.I wanted the newer pioneer model (vsx-822k) however I use 2 optical inputs and the new pioneer receivers all use just 1. Fortunately Sony has 2 and more power,I set every setting manually and skipped the auto-calibration. The instructions are easy and after set up the sound clarity is really impressive. I could hear greater detail at lower volume due to better power and efficient delivery.I believe sony receivers have really improved a lot over the last few years. I have a five year old str-dg510 in my bedroom home theater and when I connected my living room speakers (polk rc80i) it was very underwhelming. That's why my old pioneer was a great find. The strdh830 improves the sound even Moore than the pioneer receiver and is actually easier to navigate its features.Once I try the iPod feature I'll review that functionUpdate: 11/12/12I've tested the iPod function using my iPod touch. The reciever accesses the iPod's menus and songs faster than my old pioneer receiver did. It also skips songs in pandora if your playing it through the iPod.Having an iPod touch connected can make up for the lack of wifi and built in pandora. The sound is good and you can either directly control your iPod manually or with the included remote.I know audiophiles look down on sony receivers and I was drinking that kool aid til my pioneer started failing after 2 years of ownership. I had to choose my replacement at bestbuy without a lot of researching since I was under the impression my pioneer was repaired and coming home with me.The only thing better about the pioneer in my opinion is that all the speaker  connections were binding posts instead of the clips found in this Sony. Aside from that I'm satisfied with this receiver and look forward to plenty of music and movies to come with it!", "Date": "November 11, 2012"}, {"Title": "First Look...", "Author": "Thinker", "ReviewID": "R3OR3525G1UMBQ", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Good unit, not too hard to learn if you can read the little book.

And then navigate to Settings > System > Auto Standby . . . and also set that to STBY OFF.These functions may be useful if, say, you do not have a smart remote and you have all Sony Bravia or compatible hardware and want synchronized power, or if your system is designed such that power on to one of the components should indeed automatically power up the others.But for most set-ups, these settings will drive you stark raving mad during the set-up procedure, when components power on and off automatically when you do not want them to.  Just turn the features off, and the AVR will then operate like very other AVR you've set up over the years.One caveat - If you want HDMI passthrough to work, i.e. HDMI signals pass through the AVR even when it is powered down, then the documentation indicates that such passthrough is not available if \"Control for HDMI\" is OFF (but I have not verified this). Most set-ups will have the AVR powered up when HDMI passthrough is required anyway.Another IMPORTANT setting -- be sure to go into your setting as follows: Settings > HDMI > Audio Out . . . set to TV (because leaving in the default setting of TV+AMP will dumb down your audio to two channel).", "Date": "July 22, 2013"}, {"Title": "Sony STRDH830 Receiver", "Author": "Glenn Bonds", "ReviewID": "R1DJHHSY8X6VKK", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Great receiver for the money, and for the power requirements I have.

If you are using the HDMI out from the receiver to connect to a projector, I had problems where the sound wouldn't play. I would see picture but have no sound. By cycling the power or unplugging the HDMI out and plugging it back in, it would come back but fail on chapter skipping or when starting up the device again.To fix this, go to the HDMI settings in the GUI. Set the Ctrl for HDMI to OFF and set the Audio Out to AMP. It appeared that TV+AMP was set by default. The projector has no speakers, and sending the audio up to it screwed with the sound sent to the amp for some reason.Other than that, this is a great receiver with plenty of power.

But things have changed; so almost all of the cabling (except speakers) had to change, mostly due to HDMI.  I'm in a wheelchair, so I directed, and my wife did all the work.  It took us three days, and we both were a nervous wreck when it was done.The documentation is abysmal, primarily because it's organized poorly.  I was having to jump all over the place to follow references.  Sony would have done better to implement the manual in HTML and put it on a CD or the web.But the real nightmare came when I tested it, and found that controlling what comes on when becomes an unnatural act.  For example, turn my not-too-old CD changer on and the A/V receiver on, and the TV comes on.  Yeah, there's a way to turn this feature off, but then TV watching becomes less convenient.  My cable company provides a reasonable remote for the cable box, etc., and it works fine with my Sony TV.  I called Sony Support to find out the remote code for the A/V Receiver.  They wouldn't give it to me.  Company policy.The receiver sounds pretty good though.

I recently bought this receiver unpacked it, hooked it up, tested it out and was not impressed.  Not because it's an aweful product, but it's just not that great.  Especially for the price!  Read on....Don't be fooled by the glamorous description and technical specs on this particular sony receiver!  As a proud owner of the $199.99 (Best Buy) Sony DH520, the DH830 doesn't deliver!  With a $400.00 price tag, the 830 doesn't offer any bang for the buck.  Compared with the DH520, which is a whopping $200.00 cheaper, the only things you're getting out of this receiver that the 520 doen't have is one extra HDMI port, a USB port for an optional iphone/ipod playback, a Graphic User Interface (GUI) to use via your television or monitor, and an included microphone for automatically calibrating speaker setup.Please note that the 520 also has the capability of automatic speaker calibration but you have to supply your own mic (cheap addition).  Note also that the microphone Sony boxed with the 830 is about as cheap as they come!The extra HDMI port is not going to be that significant to most, but if you have a lot of equipment then the 830 just might be up your alley; however, if you have more than 4 devices that you're running audio & video out via HDMI, chances are you have an HDTV that will have up to four or more HDMI ports.  So here's the question, \"is the extra port really worth $200.00?\" especially after paying $1000 or more for a really nice HDTV.  just sayin....If you're expecting a lot out of the GUI and Iphone/Ipod playback options.....DON'T!!  Sony just flat out dropped the ball on these features!  Firstly, the GUI maintains a 4:3 aspect ratio and offers a more than poor menu design and even worse functionality.  It takes approx. 10 seconds to switch between the GUI and the source material from your device, so in short, IT'S SLOW!  The appearance is simply unappealing and attempting to use the ipod through the GUI is a nightmare to say the very least.  I don't know what Sony expected to accomplish with these features, but in my opinion, they're useless, unnecessary, and not worth the money.NOTE: Sony includes an ipod/iphone dock, but is not compatible with Iphone 5.I don't really understand why there is such a price gap between these two models, because other than the variances i listed above, the 830 doesn't offer any difference in sound quality, which to me is the most important aspect of considering a replacement or upgrade in your home theater.In conclusion, take your $400.00 buy the DH520, lots of blu-rays and games, and go have a great time!  Don't waste your money and efforts on this model!  I have been an avid Sony consumer for the past 12 years and will to continue to be, but the 830 falls way short of becoming a hot item from Sony for sure.", "Date": "December 4, 2012"}, {"Title": "Expect Better", "Author": "AZ", "ReviewID": "R2UNU6H10R4FH8", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "As usual with other sony products there are issues switching components where the soundd and or picture is not recognized until the unit is power cycled.

Sony's Tech Support was very helpful on how to make you think everything is your fault and stalling you for enough time that you can't receive a refund on their garbage. The unit had an issue of randomly shutting down while watching TV. You could watch TV for days without a problem, then right in the middle of a show or movie, it would shut down. I spent many weekends trying to solve this issue ,listening to Sony's phone tech's until one them decided that I should take it to one of their service dealers nearby (50 miles one way, away from my home). The shop owner insured me that this was a common issue with Sony receivers and it can be repaired when 2 weeks. 2 and a half months later, the shop calls and asks me to pick it up because nothing is wrong with it. I called Sony Tech Support and this time, they wanted me to ship it to Texas, so I did. I received an e-mail from one of their Tech's asking me to call him to describe the issue, so I did. I did not get to speak with that person, but someone else who said he could contact the Tech and pass on the information. I advised the tech that the unit shuts down randomly while watching TV. Sometimes it happens daily, some times it can last a week or more, but sooner or later, it shuts down. He said he will pass the info to the right tech to see what the issue is, then have the tech contact me. The next day, I received an e-mail from Sony advising me that the unit is on it's way back. I called again, and was told the tech checked it out and everything is fine. I reminded him that the unit can run fine for days at a time and just turning it on, checking it, and turning it off again, will not solve the problem. Since Sony and it's service shop had the unit for a total of over 3 months as compared to my several miserable and embarrassing weeks, I asked if I could have a new unit or a refund. I was told that it has been over 3 months (dah, since they had it for that long),and it can't be replaced, nor can I get a refund. Their solution was to send it back to me, have me install it again (like I haven't done that many times before), and if it happens again, send it back in. During all of this mess, I replaced the unit with an ONKYO product that works perfect with all of my equipment, and I refuse to go through all of the heartache of disconnecting a perfectly good unit, and replace it with this Sony unit. The unit is in the box it came in, sitting on one of shelves in my garage, where I MAKE BELIEVE it is not a piece of GARBAGE, and I MAKE BELIEVE I did not get ripped off by SONY and it's so called Tech Support. Good luck if have already purchased the product, but if you haven't, by any other brand name but sony, and you won't have to MAKE BELIEVE you have made the right purchase. What really seemed funny to me, was after all of that, Sony came up with this upgraded version of the 820 model. Makes you wonder since they did not upgrade any other model.", "Date": "February 24, 2013"}, {"Title": "Don't expect your Universal Remote to work with this product", "Author": "Music Lover \"Problem Solver\"", "ReviewID": "R2UJ7KGN97VKA7", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I bought this receiver to replace a 5 year old Pioneer unit when I upgraded to a 3D system.Setting the unit up is as difficult as most, with a lot of guesswork on just what the various sound setup schemes actually mean.  With undecipherable icons and non-specific explanations meant for the non-technical, you can never be sure just how the unit is set up.Sorry, but I like my audio pristine, and I expect to be able to set the unit up the way I want it, without DSP audio effects getting in the way.There are a number of different audio effects included which are designed to \"enhance (i.e., ruin) the audio experience,\" according to the manual.  But nowhere is the user allowed to do things my Pioneer unit allowed, such as add the subwoofer to a stereo signal for bass enhancement and specify the crossover frequency.  Seems like a simple thing in light of the heavy audio processing available in the unit.  In fact it's difficult to tell whether I've succeeded in keeping the unit from turning all the DSP FX back on from time to time by merely loading a SACD disk, or whatever (it's linked to the disk player through Bravia).  Unacceptable.At least the volume control works.I liked the sound of the Pioneer unit better.The real fly in the ointment is the lack of availability of the 3 digit device code needed to program my universal remote.  No code is listed in the manual or other product documentation.  I tried the Sony web site.  It says the code is unavailable.  I tried Sony Support.  They told me to check with the manufacturer of my universal remote.  HOW CAN SONY NOT KNOW THE 3-DIGIT CODE OF A DEVICE THEY BUILT?  It's ludicrous that they would advise me to ask a 3rd party for technical information on their products!Can you guess a number from zero to 999?  That's what I'll have to do to get it working with my remote.  It takes me about 20 seconds to enter one of the codes and test it.  That's 3 per minute, or 180 per hour.  If the code is very high on the list, it could mean several hours to find the right one.  Sony. Support.
