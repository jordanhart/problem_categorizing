This thing chews through batteries at an unbelievable rate.  The picture quality is very poor, the focus does not work well at all, and most of the automatic functions have little or no effect on the photographic outcome.I know it's cheap, but there's a good reason for that... stick with your cell phone's camera or spend a few extra bucks for something else.", "Date": "March 13, 2010"}, {"Title": "Very Satisfied Customer", "Author": "SHAREN LEE-LATZ \"purple butterfly\"", "ReviewID": "RX0EYRM3CNN3D", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I am not one that likes to \"fiddle\" with settings. I bought this because the description mentioned it would pick the right setting automatically. Yea, it does.  I used it for two weeks straight through Christmas in all types of lighting, and was really surprised with the quality.  This is a great camera for people that just want to point and shoot and let the camera do the work.  It also has an excellent macro setting, very close to object.", "Date": "December 31, 2009"}, {"Title": "Nice but needs improvement", "Author": "Carmen M.

My original review below follows the first line (update, in a way). You'll have to look on the Master 2 software CD-ROM to find out this camera is in fact the FE-26/X-21. Having found that out, please disregard some of the following, but if you want to read forward, imagine what if you just received the X-21 and wanted to look at the reviews before opening the package, or you didn't like the results and wanted to find out what others have to say? To confuse or not to confuse...I can't find any information on the Olympus X-21 (when you type that in Amazon's search box, it comes up with irrelevant items), but after some searching on Amazon, this FE-26 model perfectly matches the model and features. Perhaps European models of any given camera will confuse Americans, right? I have noticed this with another camera (apple to orange), the Samsung HZ25W (America)/WB5000 (Europe) (in the aspect of confusion so you can't find what you want).Why don't I like this camera? Before I explain, for under $100, it is very good, but cannot be compared to a far better model such as a $400 Panasonic Lumix.I received this as a gift for community activities where I live, and am very grateful for the person who sent it to me (but I must be honest and realistic about the quality of a product--I feel it's the right thing to do). Just tested it out and found (even the screen will tell you) that, if you look closely, the image quality indoors and out (regardless of lighting) is very crude, and the Image Stabilizer is highly ineffective. I think this is a problem with Olympus compacts, because a friend of mine has an older 8 megapixel that takes blurry photos in any light. Why so? Its CCD sensor is very small, the main issue, I guess.What had me flabbergasted was the X-21 takes only 10 or 11 seconds of VGA-quality video (isn't that bad compared to some higher-end compacts, actually--its quality in low light outdoors is fine, but very noisy indoors, as with the photos). There is no sound in the clips because there isn't a microphone--not even a speaker. Given that almost every digital camera nowadays records movies with sound, at least in mono. True, it was common for digital cameras over five years ago that could shoot only 15 or 30 seconds of video, and this camera is well below that standard alone--reminiscent of digital cameras turn of the millennium. I don't recommend this camera at all. In fact, I wouldn't ever buy an Olympus camera. Sorry if I sound too harsh, but this had me quite stymied at the time of this review.Not that I don't know what I'm talking about--at least if you could find anything about X-21, someone else that might know something differently about this model could find something inaccurate. One site does have this model, but appears it was discontinued, right? What X-21 seems to me is a prototype that was renamed to FE-26 (the closest guess I'd make, really). By the way, the X-21 in question is black, if that helps any. If you want a better camera under $100, try a different brand.Three stars for its limitations that fall in its price range, and for a model name that very few results for it appear in Google Search.", "Date": "January 4, 2010"}, {"Title": "Purchased for a gift", "Author": "George F. Mcginnis", "ReviewID": "RQXJCCDVZ6I8Y", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "I purchased the camera for a gift so I cannot review the product but can review the seller. The camera arrived in good time and appears to be in good condition. I was concerned that the seller shipped the package using FedEx Home to a business address and was concerned that it might arrive after the business closes as Home delivery can be made up until 8PM. I wrote them about my concern and received a very terse message back the following day. I responded to the terse message and received a response today with a much improved tone. Overall, I am satisfied with the condition the product appears to be in when I received it and with the time it took for delivery. I'm not so satisfied with my interaction with customer service. I sure hope there are no issues with the camera because I sure don't want to deal with them again.", "Date": "October 24, 2013"}, {"Title": "a necessity in today's world.", "Author": "John Cobb", "ReviewID": "R18T4H80AD0GGY", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "A minimal device which eats batteries at a high rate.

Lamb \"Micah\"", "ReviewID": "R1HEEI5CJ2XV03", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "Pros:-Compact, seems sturdy and looks nice.-The lcd viewing screen looks nice and the menus are pretty intuitive.Cons:-Default memory card only holds like 4 pictures.-Pictures are several megabytes but still look very grainy in all light conditions.  I've messed around with the different options extensively and they don't seem to make any difference.  I've seen pictures from cameras with half the mega pixels that look better.-Battery life is terrible, I get maybe 30 pictures before I have to replace the batteries.-Its probably just me but I can't really figure out what difference all the different options make.  The descriptions in the manual are worthless.  I've tried about every combo of options and still can't figure out what they do.  I'm probably slow but still it shouldn't this difficult to figure out.-Taking a picture of anything within about 5 ft or so becomes extremely blurry (it looks clear on the lcd screen though).  I've tried macro and super macro mode which are supposed to let you take close pictures but they just seem to make the picture more blurry if anything.Conclusion:  The pictures look terrible, you will spend a fortune on batteries and a new memory card is required. don't waste your money.", "Date": "April 18, 2011"}, {"Title": "Video without sound", "Author": "Ramirez Castillo Carlos Rafael", "ReviewID": "R2BID7GZ48LWL2", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "I bought this camera due to my Olympus Stylus broke on vacation. I wanted to reuse the XD picture card and accesories so I decided to buy an Olympus again. I decided to buy an Olympus Tought next year, but due to I have a 2 year old child I decided to buy a temporary replace to take pictures and videos to her.Well I discovered that the pictures this camera takes are darker and less focused than the Olymous Stylus. I don't have the battery issues that other people have. But the worst thing It was I discovered that the camero DO NOT RECORD VIDEOS WITH SOUND. It doesn't have microphone. I think that the specifications must say it.
