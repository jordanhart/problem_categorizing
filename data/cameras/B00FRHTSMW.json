{"Reviews": [{"Title": "I've been waiting for this, and as a professional videographer used to a C100, i'm very satisfied.", "Author": "Darren Levine \"He shoots, He Edits, He freque...", "ReviewID": "R22HMWBA99O4CK", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I miss my EX1, or rather, i miss the parfocal smooth ENG zoom lens that goes with such a camera. It's something we're missing in the interchangeable lens market. At the moment, sony is the only one making decent range power zooms, but they're not even constant max aperture. The 24-200mm equivalent F2.8 lens of the RX10 was by far the most attractive thing to both myself, and probably everyone else who saw the first spec sheet. The pairing of the rx100 mark 2's sensor with such a lens sounds just amazing in theory. Now we're getting to see if it holds up to trials.Note that i'm reviewing this camera mostly for its video abilities, it does do great photos, but i won't be focusing on that. I've uploaded some video frame grabs into amazon's gallery that i'll reference here.The sensor.No, it's not full frame, no it's not aps-c, no it's not m43, and no i seriously don't care. It's no secret i'm at odds with big sensor fanboys. Since aquiring the C100 (aps-c) my 5d mark 2 (full frame) gets very little use. And now that i have the RX10, it will be my primary walk around/vacation/stock footage camera. So what's the big deal some people make about wanting a big sensor? the two biggies are low light and shallow depth of field. Anyone whose shot an EX1 knows that with the 1/2\" sensor and the f1.9 lens, you can get some nice background bokeh/separation. So imagine the RX10 which has a 1\" sensor, it's much bigger than the ex1, it's bigger than the black magic pocket camera by a smidge, and many people are quite happy with the DOF abilities.Then there's the low light performance. I do wish it were a 12mp sensor and not 20, but what's the point in nitpicking? Up to iso 1600 is great, up to 3200 can still be darn good if you have correct exposure, and above that does get you something depending on the situation. The girl with the blanket in the amazon photo gallery is iso 2000I'm a C100 shooter, i'm used to using 12,800 iso if so desired and not taking a huge IQ hit. But there's no way i'm going to throw the same expectation towards the RX10. The most sensible way i can put it: If you're used to point and shoot cameras, the RX10 is bloody brilliant in low light. If you're used to interchangeable lens type cameras, you'll find the RX10 is satisfactory in low light. In my informal tests, i favored using a slower shutter instead of higher iso. 1/30 shutter is totally cheatable in anything but high motion scenes, and if shooting something where there's not much motion at all, sometimes a 1/15 can even work, and can help keep that ISO down.Rolling shutter should also be noted exists but is very well controlled, i had to really try to create it to see any.The lens8.3x zoom doesn't sound great if you're used to 50x point and shoot cameras. And in fact, sony's marketing team are horribly brilliant with the angle they took it on, and instead of pushing an '8.3x' zoom, they marketed the 35mm equivalant range of 24-200mm, and said it's like having their 24-70 and 70-200mm f2.8 big camera lenses all packed into this tiny form factor. And of course we all went holy crap that's great, because when you put it like that, in the correct perspective of someone whose used to interchangeable lens cameras, it's just brilliant. Oh, and it's a ZEISS lens! If that doesn't mean anything to you, it just means it should be held to high standards.Like i said, i miss having a power eng zoom lens so i can get a great zoom in or zoom out shot. There are practically zero options on the market for a fast constant aperture, wide range zoom lens that doesn't cost a mortgage for any interchangeable lens camera. People like me have been pining for one, and it's never come. Sony has made a few interesting power zoom lenses which i wish canon made for us canon shooters, but it's just never come. The lens on the RX10 is exactly that, it's a seemingly parfocal, fast, constant aperture power zoom lens which goes from reasonably wide, to reasonably telephoto, you also have an up to 2x digital crop called Clear Image Zoom, which is somewhat loss-less. It compares to the GH camera's ETC mode, which just means it's taking a smaller portion of the sensor to create the 1080 end image, and this should result in no resolution loss since these cameras are in fact photo cameras with many more pixels than is needed to make a 1080 video. I like that this extra reach is not just an on/off 2x switch, but rather similar to a point and shoot, when you activate it, it acts as a power-zoomable extension to the optical zoom, so once you hit the optical limit, it will smoothly go into the digital crop as if it were optical. It's not entirely perfect, there is an inconsistent transition between optical and digital which is expected. And while there technically isn't any resolution loss from this digital zoom, you are still effectively magnifying any noise. For this reason, i'd only recommend CIZ at lower ISOs, though it's always worth a try and if you like what you see, use it! This shot is 2x CIZ, so effectively 400mm.And as you can see with the girl's eyes closeup in the amazon photo gallery, the CIZ can actually look fantastic, but still, only use it if you need to. For all intensive purposes in considering the 2x CIZ, you could look at this camera as a 24-400mm full frame equivalent.It truly is a first for anything remotely near this market segment and price. The performance of the lens, thus far has lived up to the zeiss name. Even at wide open, it's sharp and mostly free of unwanted artifacts. Most likely there's in camera corrections happening, but that's just another benefit of the lens being non-interchangeable, it allows the engineers to really match the lens to the sensor as much as possible. Distortion is very minimal, with very true lines. You can spot some color fringing/CA'ing at longer focal lengths in high contrast situations, but most would consider it well controlled.Lens controls and operation.One of the things that really shows they were thinking of video people are the lens controls. You have a multi use ring which can be used for zooming or focusing, and an aperture ring which can be clicked or clickless. Starting with the multi use ring,  it's very nicely dampened and smooth, but it's fly by wire, which i'm not happy about, but accept it for what it is. It means there's no real mechanical connection to you turning the ring, it's electronic. Because of this, it's not a great experience when manual focusing. If you're used to setting markers, forget it, no 2 pulls will be the same. I really hope sony refines this more, it seems like all the pieces are there to be able to make it far better than what it is, but as it is, you have to pull focus completely by eye and almost not at all by feel. Autofocus is very useful especially in decent lighting, and if you learn the settings, you can use the settable focus point to have the camera perform an admirable rack focus for you. That of course wouldn't be all that peachy for more complex situations but hey, for some simple stuff it should work pretty nicely.So when you switch the multi use ring to zoom mode, you have two options: full zooming, or step zoom. Step zoom gives you the feel of a bag of primes, since it locks in at common focal lengths. While that's nice, i've yet to use that ring much at all for zooming, and instead opt for the zoom control lever on the handle. This is another wish i have for sony: refine this more, it is pressure sensitive, but i for the life of me haven't tamed it. I've conceded to just pushing it slightly which gives a pleasingly slow but not laborious zoom speed. Some people have shown concern over the lens's slow movement, and that they'll miss quick happening shots because of it. Well, for video i don't see this as much of a concern, as i'd rather have a zooming in shot anyway, but for photos it might be a nuisance. The lens at its fastest takes just over 2 second to fully zoom in or out. The final little drawback i've found is that if you're zoomed to 200mm, when you start to zoom back out, theres a little bit of a wobble in the image, like it's kicking back into gear or something, and while it's not a disastrous thing, it is certainly noticeable and should be kept in mind for narrative works where something like that could break the 4th wall.Did i forget to mention this thing has an ND filter built in? Like, and actual, 3 stop ND filter! NDs are important to us video fellas, and having it in there is a great valuable feature, especially considering the aperture only goes to f/16!The codecIf i had to pick my least favorite part of the camera, the codec would be it. Codecs are a tricky thing, and just because it says avchd 24mb/s, doesn't mean it's the same as avchd 24mb/s in the FS700, or C100, and in this case this codec seems to suffer a tid bit more from motion artifacting/macro blocking. Meaning that high amounts of motion in the image will cause blockiness in those areas. This could be solved by one simple thing: a higher bitrate. If i were to suggest something for the troops to rally around and urge sony to address, it would be to up the bitrate. I've already submitted my request to them, citing the panasonic GH3 as a reasonable competitor, who has a bitrate of 72mb/s. But you can't go in expecting them to change anything, so the question is: am i satisfied with it as it stands? The answer is yes, not an enthusiastic yes, but yes the recorded image is very satisfying especially if the motion isn't all over the place like a leafy tree in high wind. And there is a silver lining as well: They gave us clean uncompressed HDMI output, meaning you can plug in a $700 ninja-2 and get 4:2:2 prores that should be pristine, it's still 8 bit, but again we're talking about a mostly consumer oriented camera here. It should be noted though that it's an HDMI micro connector, which is tiny and easily dislodged, and i hope there's a solution out there to keep it secure other than vicious amounts of gaffers tape.There's a little nuisance with certain sony cameras that you'll experience when dropping the files into editing: to see the full range you'll need to correct the white and black output levels from 0-255, to 15-235, which is basically bringing up the shadows, and down the highlights to where they're supposed to be. The camera records above 100 IRE, and this is especially important if you have blown out highlights, you'll be able to bring some of them back with this correction.One of the special things about how this camera processes its video is that it doesn't skip lines like most DSLRs, instead it samples the entire sensor, which means it out-resolves most of the photo cameras out there when it comes to video. I put it up to my crappy resolution chart, and that 1000 line section of the chart is clear as day, this thing resolves 1000+ lines like a 1080 camera should. Compare that to most Canon DSLRs like the 5d mark 2, 70d, t5i, etc.. which are all resolving a good notch under 1000 lines in video mode. This is especially apparent in landscapes, i've never been satisfied shooting landscape videos with my 5d2, but the RX10 gets them nice and crisp.It should also be noted that aliasing and moire are also very well controlled and practically a non-issue. You can easily spot it on that test chart, but no one is shooting test charts in real life. My real life test is bobby the conure, and he looks as adorable as ever, nearly artifact free. (see amazon photo gallery for the RX10)The body and controlsFeels great, it's mostly a good strong metal and feels built more like a professional camera than it does a consumer camera. It's supposedly dust and moisture sealed, though i'm wondering just how so being that the lens does a whole lot of moving in and out for zoom. The lens when extended does have some wiggle. All the buttons and switches seem solid, though as a person with medium to large size hands, such a small camera takes some getting used to.The monitorsYou get both a quality LCD and a quality EVF. The EVF is much better than my C100's, and i really like that it sticks out a bit from the body so your nose isn't smushed up against the LCD. That does create a caveat though: since the LCD can rotate to face up or down, if pointed strait up, the EVF is blocking quite a bit of it. Why Sony couldn't you use a left mounted swivel screen? But anyways, both screens are more than adequate, and feel more like something you'd find on a pro oriented camera, rather than a consumer oriented camera.Focus peaking is included which was a nice addition, but for now i've pretty much stopped using it, the dots are too darn big, making me second guess focus quite a bit. It depends on the situation, some instances it helps a lot and some i switch it off, so it's nice to have the option. You also get a digital punch in focus assist, which is a more surefire way of verifying focus, and yes you can use it while recording, and you can also move it around, making it very versatile and great.It's also a nice touch that we get a top readout LCD, but to be honest, i've yet to use it in practice, the LCD and EVF do what i need.Options and featuresThis thing is stuffed full of features. The smartphone app is neat: you can use your phone to see a live, nearly lag free image from the camera, and even zoom in and out and take photos from your phone/tablet. The big disappointment though, is that you can't control video at all. Be sure to bug sony about this. This feature has lots of potential and would be great to gain additional functionality. Sony has an API for this function, so if you're savy about that stuff, please dive in.You also have reasonable control over the image, you can't get cinestyle onto it, but you can get a pretty flat image. I've found the portrait profile the be the flattest, but neutral, deep, and standard all are pretty similar with contrast dialed down. You get contrast, saturation, and sharpness control over each profile, but only +/- 3. The contrast control has a significant effect on the profiles, but i've found that sharpness and saturation have much less of an effect. I find that saturation and contrast at -3 and sharpness at 0 gives me the most out of it. If you've used a C100/300, i've likened it to the WideDR profile, but a tad flatter.You also get nearly complete control over setting buttons and whatnot, they fit the most buttons one could reasonably fit into this size body. You also get a fn button for a quick settings menu which you can set a bunch of menu items to for quick access. I'm overly pleased with how i've set mine up: the main dial on the back i set for iso, so iso is changed just like aperture or shutter: just turn the dial. the C button on top i set to ND filter, and the AEL button i set to focus punch in. Shutter speed has it's own dial on back and aperture is of course set with that aperture ring on the lens.Final thoughtsMy main use for this camera is to be my walkaround, have on me most of the time, vacation lens. I suspect that i might also use it for certain event type coverage where that parfocal zoom would get me shots that i otherwise wouldn't be able to get with my C100. If i happen to need a second camera for a shoot, i wouldn't hesitate to bring out the RX10, i'd pick it up over my 5d2 for video 9 out of 10 times.Is it overpriced? I was willing to shell out 1300 for it, and it looks like many others were as well, so i'd say no it isn't overpriced. I think it would have been a lot more attractive at $999, but i think i got what i paid for, it doesn't exist anywhere else.", "Date": "December 5, 2013"}, {"Title": "Unexpected", "Author": "Steve", "ReviewID": "R17H4U51OTJKAZ", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I purchased this camera to take on a vacation to the Amazon in South America. I did not not want to haul my heavy professional Nikon and lenses on the trip, as well as a video camera. There are many sites that review the technical aspects of this camera, and I have found them to match my experience with the camera.However, something I never expected happened. The camera has caused me to change the way I take photos. Let me try to explain...I spent many, many years learning how to operate the controls of a camera so that I could get the exposure and depth of field desired. When looking in the viewfinder, I could NOT see with my eyes the results of my settings, but I knew from experience what I was going to get. Moving to digital shortened the time it took to see the results of my settings, but the technical process of taking a photo did not change much.With the electronic viewfinder of the RX-10, when I make a setting on the camera I can see with my eyes the effect in real time. What I see in the viewfinder is what I am going to get. No waiting, no guessing.The technical aspect of taking a photo is now so darn easy, and I don't need to haul around all those lenses and a video camera.It should be the perfect camera for what I am going to use it for!", "Date": "January 17, 2014"}, {"Title": "Very nice camera.", "Author": "jerryjazz", "ReviewID": "R1OAOQDUT7BUB6", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Great image quality, very nice zoom range.

Relatively simple to use, and feels more like a camera than my RX100 (albeit 5x the size).2. Construction seems well done, but still slightly plasticy feeling.3. Faster aperture over most of the zoom range.4. Sharp lens, better than the RX100 on the longer end of things (>70mm eq.)5. Tiling screen is nice to have, but could have been touch capable at this price.6. Real lens hood and cap (familiar and perhaps preferred, to those used to slr types of camera).7. Great EVF. Really, this one is as good as, or better than the EM-5 IMO.8. Shutter button feel is great.9. Aperture ring the hails to a time when we used such things. Nice touch.10. Detents available on the aperture ring (but more on this later).11. Smooth and relatively even zoom, although slow (more on this later).12. Well balanced in your hand(s), even with the zoom fully extended.13. UI is pretty simple to navigate, and to find what you expected/needed to find.14. Weather sealing is a nice feature, but I don't anticipate shooting in a down pour very much.15. When sounds are disabled, the shutter is virtually silent. Great work Sony.Cons:1. Squeaky tilt screen (yeah, it squeaks when moving into the down low shooting position).2. Sloooooo....oooow zoom. Too slow IMO. The linkage/communication should be more direct between the ring and the movement of the lens.3. The aperture ring, while an excellent idea, only has the knurled portions in two areas of the ring. This makes it so that I constantly turn the switch that controls the detent function, into the off position. When you grab it where the knurled areas are not, you simply cannot turn it very well as your fingers impact the fingers that hold the grip. Poor design there.4. Write times are decent, but you hit the buffer and it gets very slow. It clears reasonably quickly tho, so not too bad.5. No AF-on style button, or function. Major oversight.6. Bug in the software: This means that if you accidentally plug the camera in to your computer (while the computer is in sleep mode) to charge your battery,and the camera's power switch is in the on position, it will disable your camera's ability to connect to your computer. You then have to use a card reader. Silly bug, and it needs a fix.7. Average responsiveness in the AF dept., although it does hit the target most of the time. This is actually unacceptably slow for me after trying for two days.8. Battery life: Real world use is not what they claim. If you plan to use the camera to frame your image, or review many of your images, be prepared for something like 200 shots or so. Not terrible, but not great either. (Caveat: I am using the EVF mostly).Overall then, this is a solid bit of kit, but not the one I had hoped for when placing the order. It lacks some of what I expected it to accomplish easily.What I feel are missing: The refined movements/operation of a high end camera, and the AF performance anticipated by the much touted new AF system. It lags behind my RX100 for AF speed by about half the speed.The battery charging in the camera has caused some frustration, and caused the camera to malfunction. This occurred/occurs,  when inadvertently connected to a USB then to your Mac, while the Mac is \"asleep\". Dumb oversight Sony. Get that fixed please.In the hand, its just about tall enough to feel like a real camera, but not quite tall enough to really \"hold\" like one. I have medium sized hands, so that is for my grip. Another of the tactile things is that the buttons seem lost on the back of the camera when you have it to your eye (which you will probably find yourself doing with this EVF). You can probably find the buttons ok, by training yourself to go to the horizontal wheel, then carefully moving your thumb down till you feel them. Also, the lens rattles at the front end, whether its turned off, on or fully extended. Not a lot of rattle, but I noticed it \"clicking\" around as I moved about and bumped my elbows into objects for stability.What it does well (esp. considering the size of sensor) is to capture and retain shadow and highlight details. As with the RX100, I found myself setting a negative 1/3 stop of exposure for most automated shooting. I played with processing a few jpeg images, and even they held up pretty well. The images will do better keeping details in the shadows, than in highlights though. So keep your highlights in check, your ISO's lower, and you can recover a healthy amount from those shadows.This lens is very, very good. I shoot with the Nikon 70-200/2.8 and have had the Canon version of that lens some years ago. Neither of those lenses can out perform this one for its purpose. Unlike those lenses, this one does pincushion pretty severely, but when you consider the other end (25mm), its totally acceptable IMO. Very nice job.So then, is it a keeper? I really want to, but I am fighting with myself.On the one hand I REALLY want a one stop bridge camera like this. On the other hand, it holds back in some areas that feel like Sony were not quite paying attention. I probably will keep it as it does most of what I hoped it would, and frankly, I can probably learn to work around the \"issues\" I have with it.Nice but not quite there. Perhaps the\" version II\" will address these few bugs.

Garrard", "ReviewID": "RQMIR3N5GNSSP", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "My review is a bit jumpy and all over the place so be warned- just calling it as it comes to me and I see it:Sony's best cameras used to be just fixed lens digicams prior to buying Minolta and expanding the interchangeable lens NEX and Alpha system. Cybershot used to be the star of the show. The encore has begun.They have the most experience in fixed lens digicams in the world in my opinion- and the RX10 shows it. The Cybershot division is on a tear lately and the RX10 is a shining example of their capabilities. To me, the RX10 is the best built digicam Sony has ever made, and second only to the Digilux 2/LC1 from Leica and Panasonic in build quality to all digicams ever made. A VERY close second- almost a tie.If you haven't held one, you won't know just how beautiful the engineering on this camera is. This quality alone honestly justifies it's price, never mind its ridiculous feature set and capability. Oh yeah and its weather and dust resistant, just to stick the cherry on top. Using it is highly satisfying, the menu system is very logical, packed, but not overly. All three monitors are excellent, class leading too. They aren't the best out there, but excellent. Considering it has 3, battery life is even more impressive. 400 shots plus is plenty for all day shooting, and that makes a great vacation camera. Take two batteries and a drive/flight and enjoy yourself.It's smaller in hand than pictures would have you believe, and the weight is just right considering its telephoto capability (a bit of heft keeps it steady).  It feels in essence, just right. This is a serious tool, and I've not used anything like it. It's destined to be a classic. For those that like an all in one camera, they are going to get the RX10 (understand it). Probably fall in love with it too(quirks and all). Of course it's not perfect, but as an all in one design, its unequaled ever in its category.It's price is only expensive until you add up what a system camera would cost you that would equal what the RX10 can do right out of the box. And, you'll not find any system camera that can pack what the RX10 does in such a small and convenient space.This is a true grab and go, grab and grow camera.As more people use it and buy it, I foresee a lot of happy owners spreading the word about it- and it becoming a cult classic.", "Date": "January 8, 2014"}, {"Title": "great compromise between size and image quality", "Author": "Michael Chen \"chunkychen\"", "ReviewID": "RJ5248H5VRNM8", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "After I purchased this camera, I sold my DSLR and my superzoom lens.  While giving up some in terms of image noise, it makes up for it in sharpness and focusing speed in poorly lit environments.  I purchased it at a sale price, and to be honest, I don't know if it would have paid full price for it, but it was totally worth what I paid for it.  Love this lens, love the handling of the camera.  Can easily handle images up to 3200 iso without a significant drop in quality (to my non-professional eyes).  Great vibration reduction.  I can get images at 1/10 sec that I couldn't get with my DSLR.The 28-200 equiv 2.8 Zeiss lens is the star of the camera.  I think that it pairs well with the sensor and I love to be able to shoot in dim lighting conditions because of its speed.Build quality is excellent.  It claims to be weather resistant, though I do not plan to test that claim.  Grip is nice and rubbery, but I wish it was a little larger.  I plan to put a strap on it to make it a little more secure.  I love the exposure dial and aperture ring.  The LCD display at the top is very useful, especially since I tend to turn the LCD off and use the EVF as if it were a DSLR.  I seem to get better battery life that way.So far, I have shot with this camera in concert environments, indoors with crummy CFL lighting, some outdoors and some random portraiture.  In every case, I have been pleased with how my images came out.  I get \"keepers\" much more frequently on this camera than I did on either my D80 or D5100.  I appreciate little things like the Sweep Panorama mode which is so much easier to use than other cameras, lots of control over which buttons to assign to what, creative modes aplenty that I may never use, but enjoy playing with.Video is smooth and I appreciate having the fast lens and the ability to shift apertures smoothly if I want to.  To be honest, I don't plan to shoot that much video but I hear that people are considering buying this camera as a run and gun solution.So what do I think could be better?- I don't like the pop up flash and agree w/ Ming Thein that I suspect its finicky fold-down design will result in accidentally broken flashes in the future.  It also does not flip up to bounce flash like the ones on the well regarded RX100 II.  Incidentally, I found that using a bounce card (or in my case, the plastic case that hold my lens cleaning cloth) works just fine for a bounce flash.- I do with the zoom dial would move the lens more responsively.  There is a small lag and I do miss the speed that I could change zoom ranges w/ my old superzoom.  I find myself using the zoom switch around the shutter button and it works just fine.  Just have to anticipate my shots better.- I wish you could have a setting where you shoot w/ the EVF but then have the image display on the LCD, like a real DSLR.  As it is, you can either use the EVF exclusively or the LCD exclusively, or have it automatically switch in between but always having a screen on.  I would prefer it if the screen would go off if the camera was just sitting stationary, go to EVF when your eye went to the viewfinder and then displayed the photo for viewing on the LCD.  There is no setting like this.- There is no manual included with the camera which I find strange at this price range as well as no external battery charger.  (There are cheap generic ones available on Amazon- I recommend getting one.  Thus far they seem to be working well)Will this get better images than a APS DSLR with 2.8 zoom lenses throughout its range?  No.  But that would cost $2-3K more and be much heavier to carry around.Will this get as good bokeh as a fast prime?  No, the sensor is too small.  But the bokeh isn't bad, especially at the tele end of the zoom.  My other camera is a NEX-C3 w/ a 50mm 1.8 lens.  This has all the bokeh I need so I'm ok sacrificing some in a superzoom.Is this as small as the Olympus Stylus 1?  No, it is not, it is significantly larger and heavier, however, neither one is particularly small and the RX10 has much better low light, high ISO performance.  If I was doing all outdoor or favorable lighting pictures, I would probably have considered the Stylus.  However, I do a lot of indoor shooting in unfavorable lighting.Can this camera take images which can be printed at larger sizes like 20\" x 30\"?

As well as the fact of its ability for video rather than just stills.  Because it appears to me that Sony also considered the Video crowd as well as the Stills crowd in that video was not just an afterthought like a lot of other compacts.And this camera, for me, comes as close as I can get to Sony's R1 compact from a few years ago but without the high price.  As well as the RX100M2 (which I also have) but with a longer zoom range.  So I suppose you can say that this camera combines a lot of the qualities as the R1 and the RX100M2.  And this camera has the same processor as Sony's A7 which I have been also considering but may wait now for a future upgrade to that A7 full-frame light-weight camera.  I have been a longtime fan of Nikon DSLR's and own their 5100 and 7100.  But I am slowly shifting my interests to Sony's full-frame and lighterweight cameras.I have been also a consumer of Sony's compact cameras since their F-828 which I still have and love.  I don't think you can go wrong with this camera especially since Sony has a lot of experience with single-lens compact cameras and so they make a very good dependable product.Finally, in closing, digital camera author, Gary Friedman,  just announced within the past week that he will be coming out with a book about the RX10 during the 2nd quarter of 2014.  He originally mentioned that though the camera was a very capable camera, their didn't seem to be that much interest in a book.

I owned an early Konica-Minolta bridge camera (whom Sony ultimately took over) and several Point-and-Shoots - currently the terrific little Sony WX5. Ever since I sold off my 35mm Nikon film system I have been wanting a higher-end \"digital\" replacement. I have given serious consideration to several long zoom bridge ones, but was always leery of the picture quality due to small sensor size. Having had an interchangeable 35mm kit I really did not wish to haul around all that gear plus the hassle of changing lenses to get an appropriate magnification - so the concept of a fixed lens bridge camera seemed to be a sensible option. In my opinion Sony has continued to demonstrate they are willing to rethink what a good/flexible digital camera could be. Around last Thanksgiving I began reading pre-release reviews of the RX10 - it seemed to be the best of multiple worlds for me. As I normally do, I continued to track the reception it was receiving. When I had accumulated over 40 \"expert\" reviews - most of them quite favorable - I decided that even though it is on the pricey end - it seemed to be my dream camera. At last...It has proved to be just that. Just enough zoom (a 24mm wide angle was a minimum for me) as the \"travel\" lens on my old Nikon was 28-200mm so I was satisfied with the range - I have had quite good results too with the Clear Image 2X zoom giving me an effective 400mm reach - I used an 80-400mm \"big-hunkin-piece-of-glass\" on the Nikon 35. And I have no intention of producing poster-size prints any way. The constant f2.8 is a plus too. While it is not pocketable, it is not massive either. I recently took it on a trip and carried in on a small neck strap and it never felt burdensome. Being near the ocean, the weather-sealing was also a comforting feature.I understand it has very good video specs too, but I don't know how important that will be, but just in case I do - it'll be there for me.The Sony RX10.

I really like that I can just focus on using it versus worrying about what lenses to buy, and how to carry them. Sony really under promised and over delivered on this one. My opinion is that based on reviews there are a few bad units out there, and the best plan is purchase through Amazon, and then do a thorough evaluation during the return period. Other suppliers have there own rules, and you may have to pay return shipping and insurance as well the free shipping you received at purchase, even if the return isn't due to your fault. (Read the fine print).I particularly like the RX10 EVF -it's easy to frame images and does not require scrunching ones nose against the back of the camera, doesn't require putting on reading glasses either , the menu is easy to navigate, and it feels like a solid quality camera. The weatherproofing is a plus especially if you live in a wet (or marine) climate. The battery life isn't very good, and it weighs 30oz+ but I can deal with that. I like this style of camera because it's compact, less prone to dust problems, and easier to justify purchasing as it isn't an open ended system like a DSLR.I needed a replacement for the FZ200, and also needed to have the IQ of an RX100 as I have become accustomed to that. Of course the zoom range of a RX10 is less than an FZ200 but covers most needs i.e. travel, family, gallery, museum, cathedrals, \"some\" wildlife.\"Some\" is like the old house we purchased with \"some\" insulation-after extensive remodel we found a few square feet over the kitchen ceiling i.e.a rarity. I think that 24-200mm is an ideal range especially for weddings and similar events. I'm using it in addition to the RX100. To use the DSLR analogy, instead of removing the large lens and adding a pancake lens,I will just put the RX10 aside and take the RX100 out of the belt pouch. At 28mm (only) the RX100 is still superior with an f1.8 aperture.The RX10 is larger than the FZ200 mainly in the depth front to back dimension about +5/8 inches, enough that it will not fit in the FZ200 case. Because the LCD cannot be folded inwards it has to be slid into a pouch having protection for the glass The weight is + 1/2 lb, so I need some solid performance for that increase.  I found a case for it, the Rip Offs belt pouch I have been using (2.2oz) is too small and not enough protection for the LCD glass, also I think it is too heavy for a belt pouch. The Panasonic Soft Compact ILC System Digital Camera Carrying Case works amazingly well, and is only six at Amazon. It has space for the camera and lenshood stowed, with a Crumpler Noose, and a spare battery or two. Seems to be weather resistant also. It also has more useful features, and is more useable than a Crumpler X million $ Home camera case for a fraction of the price.The RX10 ergonomics are excellent and when the camera is powered down with the lenshood in stowed position it doesn't scrunch my fingers like the FZ200. Easy to grip with one hand even at 200mm, I use a wrist strap and 2 hands usually. No abnormal things -the shutter is a bit louder than the RX100, but silent compared to an EM-1 clunk, the lens barrel does move slightly in the 200mm position when gripped, the zoom speed and power up speed is fine, the AF seems normal. The sounds, flash, and the focus light can be turned off which is the way I like to operate. The videos and stills are all in one file instead of being seperate which makes reviewing easier.I have only compared with the RX100 IQ at 100mm so far and the the RX10 appears better. It will take a while to do the rest of this testing.  I'm also going to try out the 2X clear zoom after reading one report on how well it works versus cropping, this potentially gets the zoom range into the lower end usually required for wildlife (300mm minimum) but I don't expect miracles. I added a lens cap cord because I like the one on the FZ200. Using Sony 62mm Front Lens Cap ALCF62S accessory about six at Amazon, and some Atwood Rope 1/16 inch Microcord I drilled a 1/16 inch hole on the edge of the lens cap, threaded the cord, made a mushroom end by partially unraveling the cord, and melting with a match. Then pull the cord and use a blob of glue.  It can then be cut to length with the lens in the 200mm position and the lens cap and hood in place.Update #1I found that a number of close up's, macros, long shots, short shots weren't up to snuff when viewed on a large monitor.All shots taken inside with room lighting only. Using center focus fixed the problem -they look great now.Update#2The manual says \"This camera is designed to be dust and moisture-resistant, but is not waterproof or splashproof\".Update#3I found that for low light conditions there doesn't seem to be any benefit in using RX10 CIZ mode @2X200mm (versus cropping @200mm) it just creates a more noisy image and the size of the jpeg file can be as high as 18MB.  Also for low light conditions a cropped RX10 image @200mm is as good as a FZ200 image at the maximum optical zoom 600mm, and this is with FZ200 ISO=200, RX10 ISO=3200.Update#4The outside test shot of a power pole transformer (with a small manufacturers label) showed the similar results to the low light shots, for stills RX10 CIZ does not have any benefit over just cropping an image.  The FZ200@600mm gave the usual result for this test shot and I can read the label whereas I cannot read it using the RX10@200mm with or without CIZ -when cropped. So my \"conclusion\" is that there weren't any miracles and the FZ200 is still the best fixed lens camera choice for wildlife photos where 600mm focal length is needed, also the RX10 CIZ mode isn't useful for stills so I will consider the maximum usable focal length to be 200mm and just use optical zoom. Plan to repeat this when a break in the weather happens.Update#5I've been very pleased with the results, the shots look great at 12 inches X 18 inches when viewed from about 12 inches on an LCD monitor, and also at an equivalent of 4X larger than this.

So I will not go into this products detailed operational features and capabilities. This review is being written from a different perspective, reflecting only a few highlights herein. Simply saying that this newer particular Sony product is:A very powerful Advanced Point and Shoot camera. It utilizes many of the same features as found on Sony's Alpha DSLT type products, and Sony's (series) RX100 MKII Camera. This models ability to capture outstanding color rendering in low light is extremely impressive. It is also very \"fast\" in capturing an image under varying conditions (typically using a SDHC 45mb/sec Memory Card), and it is even slightly faster with a 60+mb/sec. Memory Card. Video (live action) is better than what I obtain with even more expensive DSLR/DSLT cameras I use. Action shots such as a Duck taking off, Geese flying overhead, or a Deer trotting by are captured nicely - even without having to take hi-speed shots, or numerous frames per second. Of course you have the P,A,S,M, and Auto Mode of operation typically found on all higher-end P&S; products. I utilize the \"P\" Programmable Auto, or \"M\" Full Manual Modes as my typical norm. You can get really close (Macro type) shooting for those detailed snap shots such as a Bee gather Pollen, or the Ice Crystal formed on a Pine Tree Needle. The (8.3x) Lens Optical Zoom capability provides enough magnification for most all common usages - plus you can extend even further using the Cameras Internal Digital Zoom. Taking photos under \"fragmented shadows\" or \"backlit\" subjects are handled automatically (HDR), or you can adjust the Exposure and Depth of Field Manually to achieve a photograph image that looks professional. Fully charged Battery to number of shots capability is very high - approaching 400+ (of course there are variables) - but always carry a fully charged spare.Enough of the operational details here - you can gather more from various sources. So the real question becomes \"Is this new Sony Camera worth ALL the money retail sales are demanding at this time (around $1,300)?  After all it \"is\" just a Point and Shoot Camera, not a DSLR/DSLT type product - Right? Only you can answer that yourself. However this Sony product out performs the competitions products in Light Gathering capabilities across the full Focusing Range. Some of the newer products by Panasonic and Olympus are somewhat similar, and Canon has just announced their new GX1 MKII product (without a Viewfinder) but with a \"Full Frame\" Sensor. This Sony RX10 with its 1\" Sensor does a great job, and is nearly the size of a DSLR/DSLT's \"APS-C\" 1.5 Focusing Ratio Sensor - in simple terms that means Good!So yes, this is a great Camera product, and Sony continues to lead the industry in innovations for the consumers market. Now with all this positive \"stuff\" being said - there is one drawback with Sony (as a company) that drives many of us nuts. Their detailed \"User Help Guides\" (Sony's terminology) are typically some 250+/- Pages and must be downloaded via their Web Site which is free.  In the past couple years Sony has finally provided their \"Detailed User Guides\" in a \"PDF\" (Programmable Data File) type Formatting.  PDF's normally provide detail in a typical human way of accessing, much in the same manner a hardcopy book uses for referencing. Meaning to have: A Table Of Contents, Chapters, Page Numbers, and Index at the end, etc.  The \"User Help Guide\" for this product is (417 pages).However, Sony's method of accessing necessary operational and functional information for the user in this 417pg. \"Users Help Guide\" (and other Sony detailed Manuals) is in what is known as: \"Cascading Style Sheets design content\".There is NO traditional \"Table Of Contents\" with: a designated Subject/Topic and Page Number reference.  There is NO Index at the end with a Page Number to refer to.  The \"User Help Guide\" individual pages are numbered - but for no reason - nor accessibility to, or by page.  This whole accessing concept utilizes \"Subject Headers\" that you electronically click on, which then takes you to a \"sub-header\", you click again, and you are taken to the specific subject you are trying to gain insight into the Operational Usage, Function, or Settings (sadly in which there is minimal information provided).Now that you are finally at the specific \"Subject or Topic\" for operational information or instruction - unfortunately Sony is typically providing only a very short synopsis of information or instruction (as in a one sentence answer).  You can locally Print any Page(s), but you will NOT have ANY form of indexing or paging reference to go to in hardcopy form.  Many of us have advised Sony that this methodology is very cumbersome.  Users need to have the option of printing a hard copy of this detailed Users Guide, with the contents displayed in a traditional book type format containing a \"Table of Contents\" referencing \"Page Numbering\" in a traditional manner, and be able to place this detailed Users Help Guide into a binder(s) enabling normal access to its contents without having to use a computer, go on line, or other electronic means.  There is NO Disc provided with this camera package, and other manufacturers are doing the same thing to cut costs!This is another Sony Camera product that contains an \"Internal Help Guide\".  Access it by: Going into Menu Mode - move the pointer to an \"Operation or Subject setting\" - Press the \"delete key\" (trash can symbol), a definition will be displayed on the Rear LCD with a few words answer covering most subjects.  Once again a great feature also found on several Sony and other brands of camera products, but the internal help guide as programmed into the RX10 is weaker, and contains far less information than on some of Sony's other Camera products (i.e.: their HX9, HX10, HX200, HX300's Alpha's, etc.).Simply stated - Sony products are great! This RX10 Camera has a very high build quality. I also own and use Canon and Nikon high end products, and I am very impressed with this new Sony RX10 product.  There is very little information contained in Sony's 30pg. General Users Manual that comes with the camera, and most of those pages are dedicated to T&C;'s, Do's and Don'ts.  In the electronic accessed 417pg. detailed \"Users Help Guide\" there are dozens of literally wasted pages, very few Pictures or Illustrations.  Documentation is poorly done.  Canon and Nikon's detailed User Manuals are downloadable, or contained on a CD that is packaged with some of their higher-end products, and contain very good Illustrations, Photos, and detailed Operational Instructions.

If the focus is great, the colors are cartoonish, and so on.Enter the RX10 world, and almost everything you are looking for is there.The built quality is great. The view finder and LCD are not the best, but top notch.I was amazed by the customization of the camera, even better than the Olympus and beats the Canon 70D. You will be happy with the customization.Even Sony pays attention to the minor details about this camera, an example is how the picture enlarges after you take it to check the focus: Press the RX 10 enlarge button and the photo is huge, so you check the focus right away, while in the 70D, you have to press many times to enlarge the picture.The lens is sharp, very sharp, you have to see to believe.The huge megapixel count give you the chance to crop without loss in picture quality.The video, unbelievable, period.The microphones, are very sensitive. If I breath while video graphing, they will pick up my breath sounds:)The flash, beautiful, no camera I owned take more beautiful flash pictures.I can go on and on, but will stop here.One con, and I think Sony is great in spoiling their hard work, is that the screen is not touch, sad.This camera is amazing, and with all my respect to the reviews that criticize the price, claiming that you can get a DSLR  with the money you will pay for the RX10, they are wrong, because the RX10 beats all the DSLRs of the same price.

You can see the shot through your smart phone but that takes a bit of doing.The \u201cMenu\u201d button is placed so that you have to use your left thumb to press it. This may sound like a petty concern, but it is actually very awkward to have to use two thumbs to poke around the camera.  Instead of being able to hold the camera in my left hand, I have to shift holding it in my right just to press one button.The camera seems to really gobble up the battery. I have owned many digital cameras over the years and this is the first time I\u2019ve considered buying a back up battery.Conclusion:The first three cons seem pretty unforgivable for the engineers at Sony.

I did four hours of video and then compiled the footage into a finished DVD for the show's director. The only thing that I would like different about this camera would a variable speed zoom and a touch LCD screen.  This camera has one zoom speed which is slow.  I would prefer a manual zoom lens.  The build is good and much better then other Sony products like the SLT Alpha 57 and 65. I do think the product is $200 overpriced.  But considering that I get a constant focal range for zooming without the need of changing lenses makes this the least expensive option to get an F2 .8 Aperture.  I was considering getting a Panasonic GH3 with two different F2 .8 lenses to get the same focal range but the cost would have been much higher and I want to be able to zoom from wide to tele with just one lens.

I'm at a point where I want a good sturdy camera with wheels and dials I can relate to and adjust to what situation I'm in quickly, with a built-in lens, and something that can take a little weather, while being capable of producing high quality photographs in a wide range of situations.  No easy task to be sure.  A one inch sensor seems like a compromise for what I want to achieve, image-wise, and of course, it is, but the fact is.. no one is making anything with this sort of capabilities, all built in with a larger sensor..period.  Not with a Carl Zeiss 2.8 24-200 zoom built in..not with weather-sealing...not with hands on lens focus/zoom/aperture control..not with a rock solid feel to it and once getting used to it and setting up being able to take candids one handed from odd angles and having the confidence the pics will actually be in focus.  It has taken me awhile to test and discover what the camera is capable of and it is a very sturdy, reliable piece of work that one can lug around day to day and snatch it up ..point and shoot (if you have it set up right), and get remarkably consistent photos with.  Once you learn it's jpeg abilities and how much you can get from the RAW shots it's just a camera that becomes easy to love.  I haven't used it for movies much yet, but many people seem to love it for that purpose, and I've had no complaints with the little I've done with it in that regard.  I am looking to lose the system camera way of doing things.and The Sony RX-10 has been making me very happy..I admit to also having a Canon Super-zoom i take moon shots with, but with the smaller sensors I just can't be thrilled with the over-all image quality.  My next camera will be a Fujifilm X100s with an APSC sized sensor and a fixed Fujinon 2.0 35 mm equivalent lens.  A runabout easy to carry high quality image, fun, oldschool-like range-finder-like camera for getting extra detail, and looking a bit stylish while I do it.  SO..we all have our needs and desires with cameras..I am still having fun playing with mine..and I can recommend the Sony RX-10 for a solid piece of work that will deliver the goods..not full frame goods..but  for $2800..you still get  a fixed lens...and let's face it..practically, a 24-200 (plus 2x clear-zoom) is a lot of practicality.  Oh yeah..it's also great at close focus..the built in stereo microphones are pretty amazing..and when you zoom while filming there is no noise..zip..none..or other noises while you make adjustments..My Canon SX50HS picks up every touch I make to any adjustment as a loud CLICK..and so forth..well there is a big price difference..and the Canon is mostly good for it's amazing 1250mm zoom..optical..but then Fuji makes one that might be better..Anyhow..I highly recommend the SONY RX-10  for a great sturdy all around multipurpose camera.  visit gonzphoto.com if you want to see some of my work with the Sony and other cameras. It is only just that I also mention a fault in the Sony System which is inherent with using the camera.  I hate the Sony RAW file handling program .  It is ridiculously slow and for most purposes unusable.  Hence..one must convert all the Sony RAW files to DNG files so they can be then precessed using Adobe Photoshop.  If there has been an update to Adobe that enables them to use the ARW files from Sony, or if someone knows a better way to use them..I apologize for the complaint, but as far as I know this is still an ongoing problem.  If Sony at least created a usable program to work with it RAW files as Canon has with it's Digital Master Pro it would save you from having to convert all your ARW file to DNG's just to use them with a proper program.  It's often just one step too many when you have a lot of photos to process, and don't just want to shoot jpgs.  To me..it is the major flaw in the setup.

Because I am not ashamed to mentioned my gears.If you are making money, then those above cameras would be fine.But here is where the Sony DSC-RX10 shines over those and the rest dslrs, slts, 4/3 and m4/3.First, remember the Sony DSC-R1?  This stirred Nikon when they charged the D2 for $5,000.00 without a lens that uses the same sensor that was on the DSC-R1.* the price includes, like if your are getting the C/N, 24-70/2.8, 70-200/2.8 and has a pop-up, like my Hasselblad HD.* if you got two of those lenses, you won't be able to get ATG/Carl Zeiss T* lens with OSS (IS or VR) from ATG's 24-200/2.0 or X's 24-200/2.8.* carry two lenses plus a cheap flash (430EX or SB-600) will add lots of weight.* if you are done shooting fine portraits that can sell over $6,000.00+ for one 16X20, with above cameras. Then using this camera will do.* this is where this ATG/Sony out performed all the above... it can shoot up to 1600 with all flashes that were ever made.  that's not in HSS or Auto FP.  So if you are a flash photographer then you will know this is very important.  ever have overheating/shutdown on your claimed pro flash, like 600EX-RT/580EXII or SB-800/900/910?* 1600 (1/1600) of a normal flash sync:-)So any pro want to challenge to see if your camera can shoot above 250, without the black band?Because none of my models listed for you can do that.* it can shoot near silent modes.* again, shooting at budget events & children sports & weddings or at wedding receptions, this camera can do it all up to 10 fps.* shoot into bright sunlight and to overpower the sun or blurred the background with flash sync up to 1600 simply can not be done w/dslr or slt.FYI: only the ATG Gold MG8k Flash Kim X3 can shoot without overheating nor shutdown for C/N.* supports the ATG Gold MG8k Flash Kim X3, ATG Gold Pro II and Sony HVL-F60M flashes.* buy another supports ATG/Sony ADI TTL flash and you can shoot wireless IR ATG ADI TTL flashes with ratio controls.* view the images in RTS with ATG Focus Peaking before you take the picture.* program/set for ATG AF ADI Tracking or ATG Face/Eyes Recs.* near silent zooming during audio/video recording.* aTG Atomos Shogun Kim X is supported with full res.* provides studio portrait flash lighting with two flashes & able to stop motions dead still up to 1600.Photography is all about light, good optics, fast lenses, less weight to carry all day and able to shoot over 250 flash sync without doing harm to your flash.But we should know how to use it well.  And if you are good, you can go to the bank smiling.There is no such thing as a one perfect camera.FYI:ATG Sony DSC-RX10 and ATG Sony DSC-RX10 IR have a six months waiting period.These two have an ATG/Sony/Zeiss T* 24-200/2.0 lenses.Many working professionals are willing to pre-order & pre-paid for these special models.Just like fine photographers are willing to buy the Leica rangefinder with a dinky viewfinder and never barks on premium prices.Do you know how much the C/N 200/2.0 costs?

However, there is some important differences with an ILC (Interchangeable Lens Camera).  Let me compare this to another camera, a DSLR like the Canon EOS 70D which has an APS-C sized sensor:1) The APS-C sensor is 2.67 times larger than the 1\" sensor of the RX10.  That means you have to do some math to compare the telephoto capabilities between the two.  For example, I have the Canon EOS 70D with a \"55-250mm\" lens.  My initial assumption was that I could compare the \"24-200mm\" number with the \"55-250mm\" number and it meant that I would get a similar field of view from the RX10 as I do from the 70D with the 55-250mm lens.  This turns out to be not true, because the \"24-200mm\" printed on the RX10 is scaled to a \"35mm equivalent\" which means if you had put a 24-200mm lens on a full-frame camera you would get the same field of view.  However, the \"55-250mm\" printed on my EF-S lens is NOT a 35mm equivalent.  The 35mm equivalent is actually 88-400mm [...]- multiply by 1.6 which is the scaling factor from APS-C to 35mm.So when I was fully zoomed in on my 70D, I was at 400mm, and when I was fully zoomed in on my RX10, I was at 200mm which is not nearly the kind of superzoom I initially expected.2) Comparing the ISO light gathering scores that these two sensors have at DXOMARK.COM, the \"f/2.8\" constant aperture actually works out to a comparable f/4.  This is still really good!  But you can't compare an f/2.8 lens on the RX10 to an f/2.8 lens on an ILC, they mean different things.So in the end, the camera does not work for my needs.  I need to take photos of gymnastics competitions where I'm inside a poorly lit building 100-200 feet away from the kids I'm taking pictures of.  However, if the kind of photography that you want to do doesn't need that kind of zoom, this is an awesome camera with a great lens and sensor.  Just be aware that if you're trying to compare zoom directly to an APS-C camera, think of it more as a 15-125mm lens.Thanks to the people at dpreview.com that helped me with my math, you can see more information here: [...]", "Date": "March 4, 2014"}, {"Title": "Deal breaking limitations", "Author": "T. Ishizue \"Tom\"", "ReviewID": "R2AH2IDM10JYO1", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "Before I made this purchase, like many consumers, did a very thorough research from both independent and user reviews of the DSC-RX10. My primary reason for getting this camera was to supplement my Panasonic GH3 as my B camera for shooting videos. The one nagging issue with the GH3, as I discovered, were their poor built-in mic's despite having a very good internal audio recorder (uncompressed LPCM). To take advantage of the good internal audio recorder, you need a good external mic connected. I was hoping that based on the reviews about good audio being noted even using the built-in mic's, to my surprise, I found out that the RX10 records audio at a dismal sampling bit rate of 228 mbps at AVCHD and 128 mbps in mp4, which are highly compressed, which translates into very poor audio. Bass, especially at loud concerts, is very tinny and thin. Even using my Rode Stereo Video Mic Pro did not improve the audio as it did with the GH3. In addition, here are the other limitations of the camera that I painfully discovered:1. No still photo capture while recording video (either AVCHD or mp4). This is shocking considering that all of Sony's recent point and shoot cameras do offer this feature while shooting video in mp4 mode (I own the older HX9V). The GH3 can do these functions, as well.2. There is no way to control focus, start/stop, and monitor video using a smartphone via wifi. This is a huge deal breaker because the GH3 can do this via wifi app. Because the LCD display is not fully articulating like in the GH3, there is no way to monitor what the camera is seeing from the front.3. As mentioned above, the sound quality is very poor when compared to smaller point and shoot cameras such as the Samsung EX2F, Casio EX-ZR100, and Canon SX1 IS. These other cameras basically eliminate the need for having separate dedicated audio recorders like the Zoom H4N.None of the many reviews that I read identified these shortcomings.

For the price, one can get a good APS-C SLR with interchangeable lenses...probably a better investment.", "Date": "January 1, 2014"}, {"Title": "IS MY CAMERA WORTH IT'S PRICE AND MORE IMPORTANTLY, CAN I GET IT REPAIRED AFTER THE WARRANTY?", "Author": "LiteJazz53", "ReviewID": "RGRPGIFN4A9D8", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "My good friend decided to take our very different cameras out this past weekend for a little testing and here is what we found.  I like that Sony is trying to do new and innovative things with their cameras, but honestly, this is just not enough camera to charge $1,300.00, it's just not!  It seems to have the drawbacks of the a7/a7R and the only advantage I noticed was it's large zoom lens.  My friend and I agreed, we were much better off with another camera with a larger lens and save hundreds of dollars in the process.  I liked the Zeiss lens, but any way you cut it, this camera is too expensive and it appears many other reviews echo my opinion.  We also noticed the shutter speed changes would cause blurred pictures, also there is no front control wheel, something we both missed. While the camera does offer a pivoting screen, I was unable to place it in a position to take a \"selfie\" of my girlfriend and me, a must on a weekend outing.  Finally the electronic view finder was just plain unnatural, and looked painfully like a fluorescent light, it just bothered my eyes taking pics.  I would look at my shot and then look through the EVF and be amazed at how poor the presentation was.  The most important issue I have experienced with Sony products in general has been the ability to secure service AFTER the warranty period. I'm not sure when the DSCRX10/B was introduced, but you need to check with the Laredo Repair facility to make sure. The problem I encountered is that after (7) years, you have no outlet for repairing this or any Sony product, as their support on a product, especially ES and high end products, including cameras, ends after 7 years, no service and no parts and unfortunately I learned that the hard way, after spending $5,000.00 plus tax on Sony's Flagship ES SACD player. I was destroyed when I found out my SCD-1 SACD player was no longer supported by Sony, no parts, no remote, no service, no nothing. I have been told by retail outlets they get the blow back from customers that have spend hundreds or thousands of dollar on Sony equipment and can get no parts or service and they say in as little as two years, however I was informed it's a (7) year time frame. If you are considering a Sony product, camera, audio, computer, video, whatever, you really need to call the Laredo Repair facility and specifically ask when any given product was originally produced, because this is the first thing they check when a product shows up at their door. It does not matter when you purchased the product, what does matter is when the product was first introduced! If you are lucky, you have seven years from that introduction date, after that, like me, you have a Sony boat anchor as I do now, a $5,000.00 boat anchor, and for me this is not acceptable, which is why I must rate this product with one star, what is any product worth if you cannot have it serviced for more than 7 years from the products introduction? What IF you purchase the product 3-4 years after it's initial introduction, you then have 3-4 years left on spare parts and service and you loose!  I don't think there is any camera I have tossed after seven years, or two for that matter, and I want to be DARN SURE it can be repaired if I need service, and that has not been my experience with Sony.  If you have any doubts on Sony's short term support, check it out, however, it's something they don't wish to broadcast. By the way, do you know how many products Sony makes right now, bet you don't!  Well the answer is 900 MILLION, give or take one or two, could you support 900 MILLION products, no, that's right, you couldn't, and neither can they.", "Date": "March 28, 2014"}, {"Title": "Not Happy", "Author": "Richard C.
