And am I glad I did!  (My only regret is that I didn't buy it here on Amazon.)  This camera takes really high-quality pictures, & they are easy to download.  The video capability is also great.  It is super-easy to use.  I even handed it to my 8yr old niece one day so she could use it - all I had to do was show her where the power & shutter buttons were, & off she went with no problem at all.  The fact that it is so small & light-weight is a major plus for me.  I would definitely recomend this to others looking for a good, quality camera that is easy to use.", "Date": "February 27, 2010"}, {"Title": "Great Camera", "Author": "JR", "ReviewID": "R36N7REP25PAPV", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Purchase Polaroid 12 meg dig cam Black Friday from Big Lots for Christmas but decided to try it out, and OH boy am I glad I did so that I was able to return it before the return policy for the store was no longer valid.  Returned it and bought GE w1000/1200 from Walgreens and it was 5 dollars cheaper!! not as pretty - but - OH what a difference! With all the same functions, would recommend the GE for the best buy for an over 10 meg dig camera I paid 69.99 for mine. Still in the testing faze. But I am verrrry pleased so far. The video feature is fun. This camera is easy to use and at 12 meg a fabulous buy - only thing I would change (not a big enough problem to avoid purchase)is the small feature pictures - too small for my over 50 eyes.", "Date": "November 29, 2009"}, {"Title": "Amazing little camera!", "Author": "Nancy Youngs \"In spirit\"", "ReviewID": "R22G3PRVFT02G5", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I bought this camera and I love it.

Stevens \"Paradoxicon\"", "ReviewID": "RZ8ZA3CWC8YT5", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "This camera is simple to use, and takes ok pictures. It also has a \"movie\" mode that allows you to make videos(with audio). It requires two \"AA\" batteries(supplied). The price is ok, but I feel it should be lower.There is no memory card provided, so you have to purchase one separately, otherwise there is only enough internal memory to take ONE picture at full resolution.The resolution rating at 12.2Mp seems high, as the pictures are about the same as my friends (more expensive) 8Megapixel camera, but I admit I have no way to reliably test this aside from just viewing.  Note: I just read in the manual \"12MP(4:3), 10MP(3:2), 9MP(16:9)\". So it is dependent on viewing mode.There also appears to be a design flaw that drains the batteries. If you leave the camera connected to the computer (via the supplied USB cable) for any length of time, the batteries will go dead in a couple of hours.I don't know if this camera will recharge \"rechargeable\" batteries or not.The \"movie\" mode is nice, but the movie resolution is FAR lower than the camera resolution, giving a very grainy clip, and no apparent way of choosing a higher resolution.Bottom line, for another $20 you can get a better camera with a rechargeable battery.", "Date": "August 12, 2012"}, {"Title": "Great Camera", "Author": "laura", "ReviewID": "R1Y1PTX02L91F8", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I bought this as a birthday/early Christmas gift for my best friend. Not only was it a great deal ($40, easily worth 3 times that) but she absolutely loves it! The pictures she has taken with it also look like they are taken with a high end professional camera. She's already taken hundreds of photos and so far has no complaints on the camera. I would recommend this camera.", "Date": "November 3, 2011"}, {"Title": "good value, thin on documentation", "Author": "Kevin Z. \"ClassyGroundcovers.com\"", "ReviewID": "R26Q223Z1JU15H", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Decent camera, good value, a bit non-intuitive and hard to figure out.
