It is no DSLR, but it has LOTS of features. The iLens is a handy feature when you'd like to have control of your lens and pictures. The only downside is the noise in the higher iso range compared to similar cameras. I like the versatility of the lenses. they are all superb quality. The form factor is a little awkard but you get use to it. The on/off switch is in an inconvient position just wonder how it will hold up over time. The battery door is also a little flimsy also concerned about durability, but over all this is a nice alternative to a quick shoot when you don't won't to drag around a full sized DSLR.  I am having fun with the camera and can't wait to try out new lenses. The iLens future is superb!", "Date": "July 1, 2011"}, {"Title": "Good camera alternative", "Author": "Erika \"EB\"", "ReviewID": "R17WY4TTEJSHW6", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I recently purchased the Samsung NX100. I am a female semi-professional photgrapher and was looking for a smaller alternative to my large older SLR camera. Many of the newer SLRs are simply too big for regular carrying and are too large to comfortable accomodate my hands. I did a lot of searching and comparing similiar products but finally I settled on the Samsung NX100. So far I have found it to be better than expected. The automatic modes are easy to use and the manual photography is easy to use but still gives me the control I am looking for. My biggest problem when selecting the camera was the lack of the built in flash, but the external flash (while a bit larger than I expected) does a great job and does more than any built in flash would be able to do. So far the camera is outdoing my expectations. The kit lens does a good overall job and even does some pretty amazing macro photography. It would have been nice to have the kit lens include image stabilization but it has not been a huge problem thus far. I purchased the item as a kit with the camera, kit lens, flash, zoom lens, and a memory card. I have found the whole package great. I really did a lot of comparing between the samsung, the panasonic and the olympus equivalents, and ultimately the overall larger megapixels and sensor with the lower price brought me to Samsung. Prior to this I did not know Samsung to be in the camera market, only appliances and electronics. But I feel now that this camera is out there, Samsung really has a shot at being a quality camera maker. I would highly recommend this as a quality smaller scale alternative or even for an ameatur photographer wanting to learn more about shooting manually (the I function on this camera makes it nearly impossible to not learn the manual functions). Thus far it is a great product and I would really consider this an overall good camera.", "Date": "July 10, 2011"}, {"Title": "Small is Beautiful", "Author": "Jazz Guy", "ReviewID": "RJUNRAFZL0F5L", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I saw an ad for the Samsung NX100 on the back cover of a photography magazine and then read reviews. I ordered the next day, and so you might consider this an impulse purchase. I've given this device five stars, so please understand that my somewhat less than positive comments are minor versus the overall quality and performance.Lens cap did not stay on very well. I knew it was a matter of time before I lost it, and indeed I did lose it. Secure the lens with a lens cover strap. Better yet, Samsung should remedy this problem with a better-fitting lens cap.Other issue is that the camera does not grip well to your hands. Therefore, one should always handle the body with the strap gripped and wrapped tightly around the hand or hanging around the neck. Not a big issue.I have made nearly 1500 images in about six weeks, and I consider the output to be outstanding given the lack of preparation and ease of production. Moreover, images do not have to be cropped for 4x6 prints.Aside from the image quality and flexible capabilities, the absolute best feature is the size of the NX100. It's not a shirt-pocket camera, but unlike the more normal-sized DSLR, you can carry it anywhere.I didn't mean to do an ad for Samsung, but I'm enjoying this device. I hope you enjoy it too.", "Date": "October 6, 2011"}, {"Title": "A Fun Camera", "Author": "dslr hobbyist", "ReviewID": "RE765JQPS4CH5", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "This is a fun little camera that begs to be taken along on outings. Is it a DSLR substitute? No, although, with its large CMOS APS-C sensor, it is capable of delivering DSLR-like images. The 20-50mm kit lens is small and light, consider it a \"pancake zoom\" and as mentioned earlier, it can deliver decent images. Keeping with the theme of \"small and light\", the supplied TTL external flash does the job its designed to do without adding a lot of weight or bulk when attached to the NX100. Sadly, it has no bounce ability for interior shots, but attaching a white index card to its bottom (using a rubber band) and bending the front of the card to a 45 degree angle, one can achieve the desired bounce effect. It's not very sexy looking, but it seems to work.I wanted a smaller, grab-and-go camera and a complement to my DSLR. The NX100 certainly fills the bill in that regard. Though not quite \"pocketable\", I am more inclined to take it with me when I'm out and about. If you're in the market for a compact mirrorless camera, I feel the NX100 can offer a robust shooting experience to those wanting to upgrade from their point-and-shoots or to those wanting a 2nd grab-and-go backup camera to their DSLR.If you get this camera, the first thing you should do is upgrade its firmware. In addition to tweaking the camera's software, the upgrade adds the SWEEP PANORAMA function to the SCENES menu.For those interested in the technical aspects of the NX100, I encourage you to research the numerous reviews that can be found online. I found the reviews on Steves-digicams and Photographyblog most useful.Lastly, for the money, you can't go wrong.... get one before they're all gone.", "Date": "December 29, 2012"}, {"Title": "it came broken", "Author": "mihaela", "ReviewID": "R19T4HK4V63MJC", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "The camera came broken, so I send it back.

Unfortunately I had a good deal of trouble figuring out how to use it, in particular how to use it to capture rapidly moving (sports) images.
