Share feature and operating manual both suck, but I have no need for the share feature, and the camera is so easy to use, one doesn't need much in the way of instruction. Short battery life has been mentioned previously, but I have not found that yet. This camera uses two (2) AA alkaline cells as opposed to some that use four, so I don't consider that a negative. For the price, this camera will do everything you need in a point and shoot unit. Picture quality is great! I had a Canon that crashed that cost a lot more, that was much more difficult to use, and did not produce the quality this unit gives. So much for the big names and big price tags! This is the second item I've purchased from Amazon, and have been pleased with both.", "Date": "December 25, 2011"}, {"Title": "Lens distortion on left side", "Author": "Headhunter 6", "ReviewID": "R3BPK9T80LVYON", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "My other Kodak digital cameras have been great. This one, however, is the worst digital camera ever. Mine has very noticeable blurring on the far left 1/4 of my images, due to a lens defect of some form. It is there in all images under all lighting conditions and in all modes. Didn't discover it till about a week after I bought it--well after I had thrown out the box and other packing materials (darn!). It is especially noticeable in distance shots of scenery. And once I discovered it, I went back to look at my other photos--family and indoor shots--and noticed it there too. I guess I could crop the left 1/4 of every shot and it would be ok, but what I really want in a camera without an obvious defect.", "Date": "March 9, 2012"}, {"Title": "Great!", "Author": "Manga1", "ReviewID": "R2RXBA0X1L0BDY", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I bought this camera for my mom and she loves it its easy to use not too heavy for her and takes great pictures it also has a share button on it you can hook it up with wiifii or usb and share your pics with Facebook etc...nice camera as always Kodak knows Cameras.", "Date": "January 17, 2014"}, {"Title": "Seller's fault", "Author": "DAVEO", "ReviewID": "R253F19X9QQC16", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "bought it as a fixed product...usually I get a product that is working...this company watch out for...Price not worth it", "Date": "December 30, 2013"}, {"Title": "It died....", "Author": "Marianne Allen", "ReviewID": "R3NXTLR0GOI3LH", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "The Kodak C182 and C183 are my absolute favorite cameras because the shutter speed and clarity of the photos but they die quickly and as long as I can purchase one, I will.

It was in perfect condition.  The only reason I rated it four stars rather than five was because I purchased it for a gift.  I paid $10 extra to get it in a box so it wouldn't be so obvious it was used, and the box was so broken and had tape pulled off in multiple areas, that it made it look WORSE.  So--I wasted my $10.

Wilmoth", "ReviewID": "R3L7YFP4K8ABUT", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "The image quality is decent when the photos turn out but the Smart Capture mode is INFURIATING and I'd say about 85% of the time it is automatically falsely \"detecting\" that it needs to be in macro mode and therefore indoor shots often turn out blurry or out of focus because I'm constantly fighting it to exit macro mode.There aren't as many \"scenes\" options to chose from either, so often I'm flummoxed as to where to set it to avoid using Smart Capture. My last Kodak camera was much better, but my niece pulled it out of my hand, it bounced off the floor, and the plastic surrounding the lens broke so I had to replace it. This one seems to be fully functional except the issues I'm having with focus and Smart Capture. As soon as I can afford to, I'm going to replace it so that I'm able to get more in-focus, un-blurry shots.", "Date": "July 7, 2012"}, {"Title": "Great", "Author": "45th_Johnny", "ReviewID": "R17SXYUNE0DGMJ", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "It is the best camera I have found, for the price.  14mp, easy to use, great pictures, nice to look at and fits in your pocket.
