Even though it is not a wide lens, it has better set of features with a few dollars more. The image quality is the deal breaker. Canon has orientation detection and 720P video recording as well.", "Date": "October 18, 2010"}, {"Title": "AVOID!!", "Author": "BelugaWhale", "ReviewID": "R1R64ZBJ96GVJZ", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "This camera was great when I first got it but after only a few months of use, it completely broke down!  I would turn the camera on and the screen would pop up for a few seconds before going completely blank. The camera was still on, it was just frozen. I sent it in to get repaired but after going through multiple samsung representatives they concluded that my camera could not be fixed. They offered to replace my camera for a refurbished model for a fee of $50. I was told that the damage was not covered under the warranty because of something that I had done.  I was frustrated to say the least.  This camera was kept inside a case when not in use, had not been exposed to water, and was never misused. They sent my camera back to me unrepaired.  I tried turning the camera on, but now it doesn't even do that!  My camera is now completely broken.DO NOT BUY THIS CAMERA or for that matter, ANYTHING FROM SAMSUNG.  They are completely unhelpful and do not stand behind their products.", "Date": "December 6, 2011"}, {"Title": "Samsung Camera TL105", "Author": "Joby97", "ReviewID": "R2MPY8JNT5K7H2", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Awesome camera!  Takes great videos and photos that rival my Canon SX20. The small size is very convenient to carry it with you all the time. The menu is very user friendly and we're so happy with it that we bought two of them so we each could have one. Also, the battery stays charged a long time compared to other cameras we've owned.", "Date": "February 19, 2011"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": null, "Features": null, "Name": null, "ImgURL": null, "ProductID": "B0036RBEWW"}}
