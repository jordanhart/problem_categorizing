Works great and the GPIO inputs also work great.  I hooked it up to an ELK doorbell detector so it emails me 3 pictures of someone ringing my doorbell.  I also have it continuously recording to a nas device and its held up for a year and a half with no issues.  It has held up to 0 deg F to 100 deg F.  The only issue I once had was that when it was disconnected for a few minutes and then plugged back in the camera itself didn't operate.  I left it unplugged for a while and it started working.  It uses about 4 watts of POE power.", "Date": "November 28, 2011"}, {"Title": "Domed Internet POE Camera", "Author": "Jim Coppage \"JJC\"", "ReviewID": "ROUQ1JC7E86G1", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I ran one cable back to network switch, POE (stands for power over ethernet) assigned an IP address then I could view the camera from any computer, great picture, no sound but they have models with sound, now all I need is 10 more.A very simple solution if you need a surveillance camera.", "Date": "April 25, 2011"}, {"Title": "Works great once you get one that works....", "Author": "Chris Wineinger", "ReviewID": "R1NE2YS5FGA84I", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Camera works better than expected once installed but had to RMA it twice before I got one that worked.We import the stills from the camera into a video software so we can watch a day of activity in just minutes.", "Date": "October 7, 2010"}, {"Title": "Poor support of Internet standards and interoperability", "Author": "P.

For a cheap dome PoE camera, you can't find anything better.  Easy to setup and get going.  Love the fact that it comes with an app for the Android and iPhone to monitor your cameras remotely.  People cannot give this a bad review for manual PTZ...It states that before you bought it!  If you don't need to control PTZ and just need a fixed camera, this is a great product.", "Date": "February 18, 2011"}, {"Title": "We love these cameras - so easy to set up and use", "Author": "Chika", "ReviewID": "R2RTANO8NAQM73", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "We use them inside and out with no problems.

The camera does not have the pan capability.  It is a stationary camera that needs to be adjusted manually.  There isn't a pan capability and the zoom capability distorts the image so much that it isn't usable.  The software is pretty easy to use that ships with it but I used it with Windows XP and after 1-2 weeks the pc needed to be rebooted due to the video software not releasing memory correctly.  Overall I will NOT purchase anymore of these cameras.  You get what you pay for when you purchase these cameras.  PS:  The tech support people were very rude on the phone and when I expressed my issues they said too bad and that I was the only one having issues.  Tech support from India, you have to love it.  You might as well sell products as-is no warranty because that is what I received by purchasing this product.", "Date": "October 20, 2012"}, {"Title": "Manual Pan-tilt-zoom", "Author": "RJ", "ReviewID": "R1TXLL97X1B5ZI", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "This is a PTZ but no motor.

Look out for the word \"manual\" because that's the only indication on this product that you literally have to remove the screws from the housing and adjust the pan/tilt by hand.  I don't understand how an IP camera doesn't have the option to control the camera via software.
