Excellent Quality but Missing a few for Pro-Photography", "Author": "Captain Aus", "ReviewID": "R1JUB63M3JO63M", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Its a great camera to get your started with Pro-Level photography. The stock lenses 18-55mm and 75-300mm are great starter lenses though I would have much rather preferred the 18-135mm lens with the kit but no complains here. You get everything to get you going with wonderful photos. As with any DSLRs, you can do wonders if you know how to use the camera. Canon EOS-60D surpasses both in picture and build quality compared to its Nikon counterparts (D90, D5000, D7100). Just Google the comparison with Nikon 7100 and you will realize how good this camera is.Do invest in a better tripod (monopod)than the one in the kit. I would also recommend that you read Digital Photography Vol 1-3 from Scott Kelby, even if you already are a pro. Its a great way to get into serious photography without going into the geeky details. (You can always do that later).Overall worth an investment. I have ordered the 18-135mm from the seller, anyways.", "Date": "February 28, 2011"}, {"Title": "worth it", "Author": "josh", "ReviewID": "R2J6EQPVZN7BTA", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I like this package. of course you have the camera witch is a fantastic camera and i really like that you get two different lenses. the standard 18-55mm is great for indoors and just casual photography, it does what you need without making the camera too heavy. the 75-300 is great for outdoor's and more artistic photography. be aware that this lens doesn't have a stabilizer function and gets really shaky when turned to 300mm and hand held, good thing the package also comes with a tripod.If you're looking at getting this package for the accessories aside from the camera and lenses then I would be a little hesitant. the only extra's that really make a difference is the 16GB SD card (even though it's a little slow), tripod, and the extra battery. probably only a $50-$70 value. the bag is a joke, you will NEED to buy a better camera bag and they can be rather expensive. everything else is nice to have but not really needed.when it comes down to it, it's a great deal if the different lenses are what you're looking for. If one lens is what you want I would recommend Costco's package with a 18-135mm lens, faster SD card, and nice camera bag.", "Date": "August 19, 2011"}, {"Title": "Great camera and lenses, everything else is rubbish.", "Author": "Travis", "ReviewID": "R32LHTTG1JE2JF", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "The camera proper and the two lenses included are stunning. In all honesty, I only purchased the kit because these lenses as well as the camera are worth more than the entire kit, so it was a bargain compared to buying locally. The rest of what might as well be freebies seem only to be packaged to sweeten the deal. The tripod I disposed of without a second thought. It was begging to collapse with my new camera on it. The two lens attachments (Macro and telephoto) only give a blurred and low-quality image. At a stretch, you could use them artistically, but are quite poor-quality for the purpose proposed. The flash is the only extra that holds its own, but does so in the lowest possible manner. It's about on-par with the camera flash, and is only really useful if you activate it wirelessly from a different angle for portrait lighting (you'll need more attachments and adapters for that, though). I trust the bag to hold the camera, so it does its job, but it's not a nice-looking bag by any means. Mine was branded generically as \"Focus\". The card is an official Sony one, so I expect good things for it. haven't tried the card reader, but modern computers have a build-in reader anyway. I've attached the UV filters if only to protect my lens front element from physical damage, UV protection serving as a secondary purpose. They don't seem to compromise image quality. The mini-HDMI cable looks sturdy, but haven't checked to see if it is a dud or not. Cleaning kit? Eh. Wiped one lens with it, seemed to work. Haven't even looked at the DVD yet, looks to be another gimmick. Anything I've deigned not to mention is irrelevant or worthless. I'm giving it four stars, if only because it's annoying to sort through all the useless junk to get to the main goodies. That said, they can't really detract from the price/worth ratio.
