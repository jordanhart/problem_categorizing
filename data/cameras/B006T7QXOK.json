{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Surprisingly good bang for the buck", "Author": "C. C. Holland", "ReviewID": "R3RBBGF0H00BIG", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I'm surprised by some of the negative reviews on this product, and wondering if the folks who had problems somehow landed with defective models. My experience has been pretty flawless from day one. I bought this camera as an add-on to my usual DSLR; I was looking for a pocket-sized camera with a great zoom (this one had markedly better range than other pocket cameras I tested) and a nice variety of auto, semi-auto, and manual features to play with.One of the features some of the reviews took exception to was the push-button flash. I can understand the concern about breakage, but I've used this little guy for over 5 months now in less-than-delicate conditions and haven't had an issue. I actually like the manual nature of the flash, as it's an easy way to get a \"flash\" photo -- or turn off the flash -- without fiddling with the settings menu.It's been very good with rapid response in turning on/off, the menus are relatively intuitive, and some of the menu options -- such as the panorama setting -- are outstanding. I've taken some of the most beautiful landscape shots with this tiny camera, many of which rival even those taken with my Canon.Is there some noise? Yes. I also have noticed that in automatic settings, outdoor pictures tend to be a bit blown out and overexposed. I deal with that either in Photoshop/Lightroom, or by switching to a manual setting and adjusting ISO from there.The other little quibble I have it that when the zoom is maxed out, autofocus doesn't work. You have to pull back slightly on the zoom to activate the autofocus. Other than that, I haven't experienced the loss of focus or the problem with tracking focus that another reviewer mentioned.Is it perfect? No. But for the price, it's a great little camera for travel or for everyday shutterbug adventures when a big DSLR is too much to pack along. I'd definitely recommend this purchase.", "Date": "September 14, 2012"}, {"Title": "Major Video Issues - Otherwise Good Camera", "Author": "Sam Bravern", "ReviewID": "R1SBOS0AF39AFY", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "4-stars for camera design and still image quality, 1 star for video.I have tested and compared images, video, features, and usability for all the top ultra-zoom compacts including Fuji F770EXR/F750EXR, Canon SX260HS, Sony HX9V, Panasonic ZS-15 and ZS-19/20.  This was the last camera I compared and I was expecting to really like it as Image Quality is my first priority criteria, followed by video, then features/usability.  Here's my main takeaways:- Well lit, ISO 100-200 shots: Fuji gets 3rd place.  Canon SX260HS has best detail with least noise.  Panasonic ZS-15/19/20 are next best with slightly better detail than Fuji with a tiny more noise.  Sony ties for 3rd with Fuji with slightly less detail and noise (Sony has the most agressive noise reduction of the 4 so there is a little bit more detail smearing.)- Fuji is almost unusable for video.  When you pan the camera the video stutters.  Even worse, when you zoom, camera has MAJOR problems focusing to the point the camera will not focus properly at all most of the time beyond 7X zoom.  The lens motor is also the most audible out of all the 4 cameras.  Panasonics you can barely hear the lens.  Sony wins with Panasonics coming in a close second.- Low-light / High ISO: Fuji comes in second. Sony wins. Panasonics come in third - images are unusable beyond ISO 800, too much yellow color splotching all over.  At ISO 400, it is practically a tie between Panasonic, Fuji, and Sony.  At crazy ISO 1600 and up, Fuji wins with usable images (barely) followed by Sony but you really can't expect much from these small cameras with small sensors at those kind of ISOs.- Flash: Fuji comes in third.  Very strange flash that only pops up manually (which has its benefits).  You must press tiny button on side of camera really hard.  Flash is not motorized and it looks like a part of the camera that could easily break in the future.  Flash is underpowered compared to the other cameras.- Design/Usability/Software - Fuji is heaviest of the 4 cameras but has a nice rubberized feeling body finish.  Panasonic is amazingly small. Sony in-between.  All of them have different styles of software.  Panasonic has best set of software features.  Sony very limited in scene modes.  Fuji has nice software but many of the options are locked out when in any mode other than manual.  Panasonic's wins as far as the Intelligent Auto function. Very reliable.  Canon had troubles focusing sometimes.Overall, Panasonic wins.  Fuji would be a close second, tied with Sony if the video wasn't so terrible.

It's certainly not perfect, but given the price, I have no regrets.  The zoom is outrageously noisy when recording video and the autofocus during zooming is terrible, but I still consider this a great deal and keep it with me at all times.

I use the EXR mode, but I can't really say if the super-duper EXR features deserve credit for the quality or not.  My typical use is doing candid pictures at a party from across the (reasonably well lit) room, and it seems very good for that purpose.  I chose the camera (in part) because of the IS mode to counteract ones hands shaking.  It is more of a factor than with a large camera because this camera is designed to be used while holding it in one hand and looking at the LCD on the back.  I still sometimes get a blurry picture, but it seems work well a lot of the time.  I don't have any way of doing a scientific comparison.Positives: - The camera is so small and light that I can stick it in my pocket and carry it around everywhere.  That is the reason I mostly use this camera.  My Canon Rebel (DSLR) works fine, but I can't shlep it around with me all the time. - Panorama mode works as advertised.  You have to get used to moving the camera evenly and at the right speed so that it finishes at about the same time you get to the end of the panorama, but with a couple of tries I can get it to work.Negatives: - Battery must be removed from the camera and placed into a separate device for charging.  I am concerned that there could eventually be a lot of wear and tear from opening and closing. - The auto focus seems to take a little bit of time, particularly if I'm taking a picture of something off in the distance.  Sometimes I am taking a picture of a street scene from block or two away, and I wish it had a manual focus that I could just crank out.", "Date": "November 8, 2012"}, {"Title": "THE ULTIMATE CAMERA", "Author": "Pilotjay", "ReviewID": "R16A0IZF8THERY", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This camera rocks!!!

It stopped working the first day we used it, which unfortunately was half way through a guided tour of Rome.  The lens stopped retracting and the camera registered a \"focus error\" message.  Luckily we had my iPhone which actually took some decent shots and we bought a new Nikon the next day (which does an awesome job BTW).  The technology on the Fuji sounded great and we wanted something small and easy to use.  We had a Fuji several years ago that took gorgeous, effortless pictures, but after a couple of years it developed a problem that immediately discharged the battery.  We've learned our lesson.  The most advanced technology in the world can't overcome poor quality.  This camera feels cheap and I can't get over how flimsy the flash assembly is.

That being said, I needed a camera with a good zoom and date stamp.Within a few weeks the lens cover started to stick and my photos had a black spot on the lower right corner.  That self corrected after a few days.  After 3 months of use the lens went bad-- couldn't take any photos at all. I contacted Fuji and since the camera was under warranty they gave me directions to send it in for repair.After they had the camera for a week, they sent me a bill for $200 to replace the lens.  After a lengthy phone conversation with Fuji they fixed the camera under the warranty - which we should not have to beg them to do what they promise to do when we purchase these items to begin with.  I got the unit back 5 days ago with a different lens on it.Drove 112 miles to get my photos for work yesterday and guess what?, yes my lens is malfunctioning again.  Cost me time and money.  I would send it in for repair, but I need to cut my loses now.  They can have it back, but I won't spend the $10.00 to ship it back.

These originally sold for about $350 and I got them for around $145. Unfortunately, the one I opened up and tried out could not clearly focus to save it's life. 98% of the pics were unacceptable and blurry.  My $75 digital point and shoot camera put it to the shame. I can't believe a camera of this brand, price, and metal build could be so bad, so I'm going to assume that the one we got was defective. I immediately sent the other one back as well, not wanting to take a chance on it after what happened for the first one. This may be a great camera if you get one, I wouldn't know.

It would not lock in the stored position. After being sent to numerous people at the mailing company I was able to get a return authorization email.

The lady I talked to the next day was very understanding and gave me the RMI via email and even expedited the shipping so I can (hopefully get by xmas). I even bought the extended warranty and the first salesman never even acknowledged that fact and I thought I was going to have to pay for the repair. If the company really monitors their phone calls for quality they need to listen to the phone call we had. If I get a replacement camera by xmas I would give the camera and company a 4 or 5 star rating.

The video is touted in the selling points and personally this was the main reason I purchased this camera! Something small that can shoot decent photos and good video. I'm back to using my old and very large Canon SX20IS which is lower quality video but still clear compared to this horrible camera. The video is constantly focusing in and out every second, you can even use it!  When taking pictures I have to leave a space on the right hand side to make up for the blur that takes up the whole right side on photos, this is so inconvenient and for the cost of this camera it should take decent photos and video, of which it does neither. This is a horrible camera. I have contacted Fuji and they want me to send it in of course, I'd prefer an exchange as I bought this at the end of July.
