We were looking for a camera that was easy to operate and that could do really good close up shots for our ebay business.  Well, happily we found both with this Canon Power Shot SX170. The camera is pretty intuitive and the on screen menu's are easy to follow. The only thing I took one star away for is that in order to get the pictures on to your computer, you need to pull out the memory card and plug it in. There may be a transfer cable or cord that you can purchase that will allow you to do this, but it doesn't come with the kit. Other than that, it's a great camera and we're very pleased with our purchase!", "Date": "December 26, 2013"}, {"Title": "Quality", "Author": "Richard B.
