By no means will this model blow away the seasoned  photographer, however it does cover the basics and more. We picked it up and tried it out over the weekend.First time DSLR users will enjoy the Guide Mode. It literally walked us through different shoot scenarios via the fixed 3\" LCD screen. An excellent tool, its step by step instructions allowed my niece to move from the operating booklet in no time. After a few more runs, I am sure that she will feel quite comfortable shooting in the manual mode. The quick shutter release was a nice surprise.Upon completing two days of shooting with the Nikon D3000, I walked away impressed. In manual mode, indoor shots were a balanced and perfect mix of shadow and color. As usual with shooting in low light, noise will make an appearance. However this system can be tweaked to deliver some outstanding indoor photographs. The bottom line is proper settings.A basic fix is the VR (Vibration Reduction) feature located on the lens. This should be activated, especially indoors. A tripod will certainly help. In auto mode, just set the camera to night portrait and  sit back and enjoy the rest of your flight.Outdoor shots were vibrant, sharp and rich in color without editing. The onboard flash system was more than capable in meeting fill flash requirements. Without a doubt the overall performance of the camera, features and image quality is excellent.With 10.2 megapixels to work with, I easily blew up a personal favorite my niece had taken to 16\" x 20\". Even though I don't see myself trading in my Nikon D300 for this model anytime soon, this camera is by far an upgrade over any of the souped up point and shoots out there.Its easy to see that the real jewel in this model is the auto focus system. With six auto mode settings (Landscape, Sports, Child, Closeups, Portrait, and Night Portrait) each and every photograph can be a keeper. Onboard editing tweakers won't be disappointed with this model. It covers the basics. The D3000 operates with both SD & SDHC cards.The Nikon D3000 is paired with a Nikkor 18-55mm AF-S DX lens. It will operate with any Nikkor DX and AF-S lens. Older Nikkor or similar AF lens is a no go when shooting in auto  but will function in manual mode. Since this model is not fitted with the built in optical image stabilizer, I recommend switching on the Vibration Reduction (VR) feature located on the lens. Still the best anti vibration tool is a tripod.Nikon makes it really simple with a thumb dial for tweaking aperture and shutter speed. Metering, focus modes, and exposure compensation are easily controlled via the menu. The D3000 does not shoot in video mode. This model easily shoots over three frames per second in continuous mode. The 3D tracking sensor operates quite well in low lighting.The Nikon D3000 camera kit comes packaged with a EN/EL3e Li-ion battery, charger, USB cable, video cable. strap, eye cap, eye cup, software CD-ROM, 18-55mm Nikkor lens, lens cap, instruction booklet and a one year Nikon warranty.Coming out of the gate, I still find this model a little pricey for a basic DSLR. I am sure heading into the fall and holidays buyers will begin to see a noticeable price drop. Even so, the D3000 is a fine tuned replacement for the immensely popular entry level Nikon D40. Newcomers to the DSLR community will certainly enjoy this outstanding alternative.", "Date": "September 3, 2009"}, {"Title": "Review Written for Beginner Photographers", "Author": "jpullos", "ReviewID": "R1PS2SZ81O5OOD", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I am a photography teacher in NYC and online. (See my Amazon profile for my website.) I teach beginner and intermediate photography students every week. I've also been a professional photographer for the last five years with images published in The New York Times, GQ, New York Magazine, Women's Wear Daily, The New York Observer, The Village Voice and Time Out New York.(This review is for beginner photographers.)If you're a beginner, you're most likely asking yourself: Nikon or Canon? Really, I feel confident in saying that you can't go wrong with either. I've used both brand's cameras extensively and find that they both offer amazing image quality with well-built, solid cameras that, if taken care of, will last decades. There are two differences between the cameras, though, that can be taken into consideration.The user-interface: If cameras were computers, Nikons would be PCs and Canons would be MACs. PCs are built for people not afraid of technology whereas Macs are built for people who want things super-easy. Nikons excel at customization options which means you'll see so many more options with the Advanced features of a Nikon than you will with a Canon. Canons, on the other hand, excel at ease-of-use for beginners. Canons offer less advanced options and can be easier to learn on. This can be frustrating down the line, though, once you've learned a lot about photography. At that point you may want all of the options that Nikon offers and be frustrated with your Canon. If you're someone who really likes to delve deep into your hobbies or if you're intent on becoming a professional photographer, I'd say a Nikon would be your best bet. If you're someone who wants to learn the basics of photography and only imagine yourself being a hobbyist, Canon would be a better option for you.Where Nikon excels: Flash photography. I often find myself in situations where I'm shooting event photography (weddings, movie premiers, benefits and galas) where I need to use a lot of flash. For this kind of photography, I'll always prefer to be shooting with a Nikon. Nikon's flash metering (how the camera magically decides how much light to fire out of the flash) is much more consistent than Canon's. You can take a Canon and shoot the same scene three times in a row with flash and all three images will be at different brightness levels. You can do the same thing with a Nikon and all three images will be wonderfully the same. If you're somebody who plans on shooting a lot with flash (indoor photography, event photography, etc.) you'll want to consider going with Nikon.Where Canon excels: Richness of colors. I've been in numerous situations where I've been on the red carpet taking the exact same picture as the photographer next to me. I'll have a Canon and the person next to me will have a Nikon. This has provided quite a few opportunities to compare the images side-by-side. What I've found is that the colors on the Canon's images look richer and make the image pop more. If I'm doing fine art photography (anything I'd like to someday hang in a gallery), I'll always want to be shooting with a Canon for this reason.If you're set on Nikon, there are three cameras you should be considering and it all comes down to what your budget is:D7000 $1,400 without lensD5100 $750 without lensD3100 $600 only available with lens(current prices as of 2/19/11)Since you're on the D3000 Amazon page, though, I'm going to guess that you're considering the D3000 which Amazon is currently selling for $530 (with lens). If you're considering buying the D3000 because you didn't realize that Nikon has replaced it with a new camera model (the D3100), then you may want to go straight for the new model, depending on your budget. If you were already aware that Nikon has a newer model and are still considering the D3000 then here's how the D3000 stacks up to the D3100. (The D3000 is such a great camera that, even though Nikon has a newer, replacement model, they still sell the D3000!)D3000 vs D3100Where the D3100 excels:-Higher resolution: The D3100 is a 14 MegaPixel camera whereas the D3000 is only a 10 MegaPixel camera. This effects how big you can print your images and have them remain high quality prints. 14 MegaPixels will print as big as 23 inches by 15 inches whereas 10 MegaPixels will print as big as 19 inches by 13 inches. A higher resolution also means you can crop an image and have the remaining image still remain high quality.-Has live view. (This is the screen that pops up on the back of the screen that allows you to see what you're going to shoot before you shoot it. This would be used as an alternative to the viewfinder but, be aware, does eat up battery power quickly and, generally speaking, results in the camera not focusing as fast.)-Higher ISO options. The D3100 offers two more stops of ISO than the D3000 does. If you don't know what ISO means (or what a stop is) just know that this allows you to more easily shoot images in low-light situations.-Shoots movies. (If you want to be able to create video with your camera, you won't be able to do it with the D3000.)Where the D3000 excels:-It's a more affordable camera. By saving money on the D3000, you'll have more money in your budget for an awesome lens or two!To sum this all up, if you can only afford the D3000, then you'll be really happy with it. The D3000 is a solid camera. If you can afford to spend the extra money for the D3100, though, there's no reason to not go with the D3100. Overall, it's a better camera for not that much more money.If I can clarify any of this, please email me!-JP Pullos, photography teacher, NYC and online (see my Amazon profile for my website)", "Date": "October 19, 2011"}, {"Title": "Excellent first DSLR", "Author": "Alexis Coxon", "ReviewID": "R35VYSOEH7L4QN", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "My good old point-and-shoot camera (one of the Canon PowerShot series) had served me faithfully, but I was growing frustrated with its limitations. It seemed SO slow -- I was always missing great shots of my kids. The low-light performance was not particularly good. And I knew if I ever wanted to take more than basic family snapshots, I was going to need to bite the bullet and buy a DSLR. But they seemed so intimidating!After doing a ton of research online and trying out my sister-in-law's slightly older Nikon D40, I settled on the new D3000. And I love it! It really is easier to use than I could've imagined, and the shots I've gotten so far are amazing. I have no photographic training, but I am really delighted with the pictures I've been getting so far. I never could have imagined there would be SUCH a huge difference. I've actually gotten -sharp- pictures of my toddler in motion, rather than just kid-shaped blurs! I took it to a local park last night for a couple hours and took some really nice photos there, too.Some things you might want to know if you, like me, are new to DSLRs:* Everything you need is in the box (flash, lens, camera body, camera strap, manual, etc.) -except- for a memory card. You'll need to get an SD or SHDC card to use with your camera. These are quite affordable. Of course, you may WANT more lenses, etc., later, but the kit lens is very nice, and offers a decent amount of flexibility. I would suggest, however, get a lens filter to help protect the lens,* The D3000 comes with a \"Guide\" -- it helps you choose what effect you're looking for (freeze motion, blur background, etc.) and then helps you pick the right settings. But even just on \"auto\" mode, it takes some really fabulous pictures.* Even as a relatively small DSLR, it's definitely bigger and heavier than most point-and-shoots. This wasn't a big issue to me, as I mostly plan to use it at home, but if you want something you can stick in your pocket, a DSLR may not be for you. (I plan to keep my old point-and-shoot as a backup for times when I want something I can just stow in my purse.)* The D3000 does not have \"Live View,\" where you can frame your shot in the LCD screen. I was a little concerned about this at first, but surprisingly, I've found that I really don't miss it at all. It also does not have video mode (which I find I don't miss, either, because I've always hated taking videos with a camera! They come out all shaky for me.)* The included printed manual is pretty short and sweet. There is a manual on CD included that is much more complete. Neither, of course, really explains DSLRs in depth or photographic principles, so if you'd really like to learn more about using your camera to its fullest, I'd suggest Digital SLR Cameras and Photography For Dummies (For Dummies (Computer/Tech)) and Digital Photography Workbook For Dummies (For Dummies (Sports & Hobbies)). The former does a great job of explaining how your camera works, why DSLRs are different from point-and-shoots, how to care for your camera, and what accessories you may want. The latter has tons of hands-on exercises to help you learn your way around your camera and improve your photography.In short, if you'd like to jump into the DSLR pond, the D3000 is definitely an excellent introduction. Come on in -- the water's great!", "Date": "September 5, 2009"}, {"Title": "Super user friendly beginner camera with great AF system and image quality", "Author": "Enche Tjin", "ReviewID": "R2FM8BJ34NO5QP", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Nikon D3000 is Nikon beginner / entry level camera. It replaces Nikon D60. There are three major upgrade of D3000 from D60. There are 11 Auto focus system with dynamic tracking and 3D tracking. This AF system is the same as Nikon mid-range/enthusiast camera, D90. Also, the LCD screen has been enlarged to 3 inches from 2.5 inches. However, the screen resolution remains the same at 230,000 dots. Also new is the Guide mode, this new mode is working as your tutor on basic photography. It helps you set up your camera, in the same time, it tells you about basic photography setting and concepts. Other than that, everything looks the same, buttons, placement, viewfinder and image quality/resolution.It is an average size for beginner DSLR camera. But if you are coming from compact camera, you might a bit surprise of the size. On the other hand, if you are coming from advanced DSLR cameras, then you will feel this camera is compact and light.Nikon D3000 has a thumb dial, which you will use most of the time to change shutter speed and aperture. There are mode dial on the top of the camera. Several basic buttons such as playback, delete, menu, magnifiy/zoom, and exposure compensation. There is also a function (Fn) button on the left side, near the flash that you can customize according to your need.Coming from more advance Nikon camera like Nikon D90, what missing are the ISO button, Image Quality button, Release mode button, AF mode button and White Balance button. If you want to change  above settings, you need to go to shooting menu (green camera icon). I recommend you to customize the Fn button so you can change you favorite button faster. I change my D3000 Fn button to ISO setting.Build quality and ErgonomicNikon D3000 body is built by rugged plastic. There is texture in the grip area to ensure comfortable grip. The built quality of outer shell is the same or almost the same as Nikon D90. The difference is there are more textured finish in Nikon D90 body. Ergonomically, it is good to hold, but the space between lens mount and the grip is pretty tight. If you mount bigger lens or if you have big hands, then you might not feel it comfortable. Compare to Nikon D60, I noticed that the pistol grip is more curvy instead of pointy. This is a small improvement that you might appreciate.LCD ScreenD3000 has 3 inches LCD screen with 230k resolution. This is considered basic, but the screen is clear, sharp. If you like to check on the details or pixel levels, it is best to check the images on your computer. In the bright light condition, this screen is relatively good. There is minimal glare/reflection.Nikon D3000 has 95% coverage and 0.8x magnification viewfinder. It is considered small for DSLR size, but for people who moves from superzooms or advanced compact, this viewfinder are big and a lot clearer. Manual focusing is more challenging than the other Nikon's more advanced DSLRs.Like Nikon D5000, Nikon D3000 does not have top LCD screen like D90 or more advanced camera. Unlike many of competitors entry level DSLR cameras, Nikon D3000 does not have any live view feature.Lens and CompatibilityNikon D3000 comes with Nikon 18-55mm f/3.5-5.6 VR lens. This lens has a plastic mount, but the image quality and the light is recommendable. It never get super sharp like pro grade lens, but pro grade lens might costs more than ten times, so 18-55mm VR is one of the best value lens out in the market.The lens has image stabilization feature which is called Vibration Reduction (VR). It works well and quietly up to 3 stops. If you hold the camera tight and still, you can shoot up to a quarter second without motion blur.Unfortunately, D3000 does not have built in focus motor in the camera, therefore, it can't auto focus older lenses such as the venerable Nikon 50mm f/1.8 or the legendary Nikon 85mm f/1.4D. Lenses that compatible with this camera are lenses that has built in motor (usually has AF-S code on it) and for third party lenses, look for HSM (Sigma lens).Image Quality and ISONikon D3000 employs 10 megapixel image sensor. This sensor is a bit inferior than sensors in the D90 and D300. But still this is more adequate for large print.Image quality is excellent up to ISO 800. At 1600, a lot of noises start to creep in especially in shadow area. At 3200 (or Hi setting), the image is unacceptable only for very small print of web.If you turn on Noise Reduction or NR (unfortunately no low-medium-strong option), the camera with smooth out the noises, but the image become softer and lose some details. If you concern about the lost of details, I suggest you to shoot with NR off, and then take care the images with image editing software to treat the noise.Like other Nikon DSLR cameras, D3000 also has Auto ISO limiter. You can effectively limit the ISO and minimum shutter speed. The Auto ISO works very well and accurate most of the time. My favorite way to use this is to set the camera to Auto ISO, and then use Aperture mode and let the camera adjust the rest for me.D3000 does not have 1/3 stops ISO increments, so you only can set ISO to the regular base level or 100, 200, 400, 800, 1600 and 3200 (HI). But to be fair, most of the entry level DSLR cameras does not have that too.Auto Focus and Continuous burstThe new 11 AF points are miles better than old 3 points AF system. It helps a lot in composition and fortunately, it also comes with dynamic tracking and 3D tracking which is great for moving objects and sports. The auto focus is very fast and responsive. However, D3000 has only 3 frame per second, so you might miss some shots when shooting sports or fast moving objects.Guide ModeNikon's Guide mode is a tutor for absolute beginner. It does a good job on helping you to set up the camera and also help you to get the best setting for particular kind of photography. For example, when you choose  sports mode, it suggest you to set high shutter speed to eliminate motion blur.Guide mode is basically a super duper friendly menu that consists of three major options: Shooting, playback and camera setup. Shooting menu (the most important of all), divided into two, easy operation and advanced operation.Easy operation consists of Auto, no flash, distant subjects, sleeping faces (children), moving subjects, landscapes, portrait, and night portrait.Advanced operation consists of soften background, freeze motion (people) and freeze motion (vehicle). Unlike the usual mode, Guide mode explains to you what kind of setting is important for particular kind of photography, so you can gain insight and knowledge of basic photography concept.However, keep in mind that although his guide menu is very helpful, but it does not replace basic photography course or seminar.Photo RetouchD3000 offers some basic camera processing such as quick retouch (camera automatically enhance or optimize the image). Miniature effect which is fun to play with. Basically you will need to choose a point in the image, and then the rest of the image will be blurred, giving a depth of field illusion.Other basic retouches are also available such as crop/trim, filter effects, color balance, BW, sepia, etc. The downside is the processing time of one image could take up to 10 seconds.ConclusionI applaud Nikon for D3000 because the design is very user friendly through Guide Mode. With the help of this mode, beginners will able to learn basic photography faster. Various photo retouches ignite creativity and fun. I also love the the installment of 11 AF system which is usually reserved for higher end cameras.  D3000's competitors does not have this sophisticated AF system.On the other hand, Nikon D3000 have two main weaknesses, first it does not have built-in AF motor for older but great lenses. D3000 also does not have live view mode which actually can help tremendously in focusing those old lenses.If you have Nikon D60 you might want to look for more advanced camera such as Nikon D90 or D300. However, if you have Nikon D40 or compact cameras, this camera is a very good upgrade choice.In short, Nikon D3000 is a solid camera for beginner that is simple, fun, and has great image quality. It is definitely worth your money.Subjective Rating - Relative to entry level DSLR camerasImage Quality : 4/5Features : 4/5Performance : 5/5Body and Handling : 4/5Value for Money : 4/5Please check out my website for more reviews.", "Date": "September 11, 2009"}, {"Title": "Love it!", "Author": "S. Taubenheim", "ReviewID": "R28LQ5KUMAOXZV", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Ok, this review is more for the amateurs like myself.  The reviews from the obvious pros was great and very educating, but for someone who is DSLR illiterate, I was also looking for a no-nonsense, buy this product or don't, review.  Here are my initial thoughts of the Nikon D3000 so far:Out of the box it was a snap to use.  The quick start guide was just that.  It got you up and running in no time.  However, you have to be a finger contortionist just to get the strap properly affixed to the camera.  No big deal; just took me about 10 minutes.The accompanying lens is a cinch to attach to the body.  This camera looks slick.  It's more compact and a bit lighter than the other DSLR's I've test run at the brick and mortar stores.Turn the camera on and the big 3\" display lights up with all the camera data I hope to understand one day...f-stop, aperature, numbers, other numbers, dots and squares, and so on.  I'm positive they all mean something.  The included user manual says what all this stuff means, but not how a newbie like me can manipulate these settings to produce great pictures.  But that's what this entry level camera is all about.  Baby steps.Set the camera to AUTO and shoot away.  The camera does everything for you.  AUTO is fine if you want immediate pictures.  But start learning the camera's real capabilities (which only requires some light reading on-line or simple experimentation), and you're shooting your best photos ever.  I'm not a big fan of flowers, but I messed with the settings, took a picture of some purpley flowers with a blurry background and, voila, I had myself a Finer Living Magazine cover.Want pictures of the kiddos?  Tired of using your point-and-shoot, pressing the button, and 3 seconds later it takes the picture?  You missed the \"golden frame\".  Guess what? This DSLR will take the picture as soon as you press the shutter button.  And did you know this $450 camera will take the picture just as fast as the $5000 jobbers?  Yes, you knew that.  I just wanted to show that you don't need to spend loads of money on a camera to take great pictures.Is this the camera to have for professional wedding photographs?  Not unless it's 4AM at a wedding chapel on the Vegas Strip.  At 10MP this camera wasn't designed for the professional to take professional photos.  Use this camera for everyday pictures of the family, nature, vacations, your neighbor (kidding).Some people don't like the fact that it doesn't have video.  Who cares?  Video cameras are for video.  DSLR's are for taking pictures.  Want video on a DSLR?  Buy the D5000 or a new Canon, Mr. Moneybags.Overall, this camera has the ability to take incredible photos. Just learn what it's capable of and you'll be very happy with it. You will not find a better price for the D3000 anywhere but Amazon. No sales tax (in most states, I think) saves you $60+.Graduating from a point and shoot digital to a DSLR makes buying the Nikon D3000 the obvious choice.", "Date": "March 24, 2010"}, {"Title": "Perfect SLR Anybody Can Use", "Author": "Just a guy", "ReviewID": "R1KTZRZ3CB7CKH", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This is probably not the right camera for someone who is an uber-photography hobyist.  This is the right camera for someone who enjoys photography and wants to step up from a quality point and shoot digital pocket camera.I wanted an SLR because I wanted to improve the photos I was taking of my 18 month old daughter.  My Canon SD750 pocket camera takes great photos, but not the same quality as an SLR would.The D3000 is great because it has an auto mode that essentially turns it into a point and shoot camera.  There is no shutter lag and - with the right memory card - you can hit continuous shoot to take 3 shots per second.  (This is ideal for shots of my daughter going down a slide or kicking a ball in the backyard.)If you end up \"getting into\" photography and want to futz with the settings, this camera has everything you could need.  11 point multi-focus and fancy light metering will keep anyone busy.  That said, you can also just leave it in auto and it will take phenominal photos.One of the best features is the \"?\" button.  On any screen, you can push the \"?\" button to get a quick description of what the different setting options will do.  For example, when selecting a manual metering mode, it will tell you the difference between multimetering and spotmetering.The Guide feature is another helpful option that guides you through questions about what you are shooting and adjusts the settings accordingly.  To be frank, I find I don't use that very much.The camera comes with an 18-55 lens which is perfectly adequate for 80% of shooting.  I also purchased a 35mm f/1.8 lens so that I could take more shots indoors without flash.  I might also consider a 70-300 or 55-200 at some point down the road.  For now, I have not had a need to do much telephoto work.  I find that I can take the photo with the lens I have and then just zoom and crop on the computer.  The image sensor has enough quality that you can really do a significant crop and zoom without a noticable loss in image quality.Here are some negatives:1) Shooting above 800 ISO tends to yield grainy photos.  I try to keep it at 800 or below.  That is another reason I bought the Nikon 35mm f/1.8G AF-S DX Lens for Nikon Digital SLR Cameras lens.2) You need a fast SD card to avoid shooting delays.  The camera has an image buffer.  I found that using a standard Sandisk 15mb/s card, I was able to shoot (on continuous shooting) about 6 or 8 photos before hitting the buffer.  I bought a Sandisk Extreme III 30mb/s card, and I have not been able to hit the buffer.  There are also some shooting effects that involve post shot processing, and these can slightly slow down the camera.3) I sort of wish I could have bought this with only the body and then added the lenses I wanted.  The 18-55 is a very good lens, but I probably would have just ended up buying an 18, a 35 and maybe a longer zoom.ConclusionThis is a great camera.  It is a very good value and is the natural step up from a pocket digital.  In my opinion, all of the criticisms I have seen online are from people who expect an entry level camera to have all of the bells and whistles found on models 2-10x the price.UPDATE: Nearly one year later . . .

I tried turn off the Active D-Lighting, but it didn't help.* Battery doesn't lock into place as well as on the Canon, I can feel it rattling a bit* I noticed a couple of hot pixels on dark backgrounds (but to be fair, it's hard to find any sensor with zero dead/hot pixels)* Minor, but annoying: Nikon rounds your pictures left to \"1.0K\" instead of a true value* Autofocus seems slower* Still some dumb UI decisions, like if I want to constantly do 2-sec self-timer photos, I have to keep reseting it. And the continuous file numbering is off by default, meaning it resets every time you format or do a new memory card. Overall, Nikon is amazing with ergonomics/UI design, but they are not perfect.* It is missing what have come to be standard features in DSLRs these days: the XS came with auto exposure bracketing and auto white balance bracketing; the D3000 has neither.Summary: Anyone on a budget or just getting their feet wet with DSLR technology and stepping up from point-and-shoots will be blown away by the features and image quality. Those people looking for a more refined or feature-filled DSLR experience should look at higher-end (and more expensive) models.", "Date": "November 28, 2009"}, {"Title": "Mixed emotions", "Author": "Dave", "ReviewID": "R3CIOJ4J24XVFY", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "I bought this camera when it first came out over a month ago and I have been using it quite a bit.  It replaces my old D50 which I gave to my son.I really like how small and light the camera is.  It is easy to use and I am happy to have a VR lens.  I was also excited to get ADR - but, that's where a huge problem arises:  I was stunned and disappointed to discover that enabling the ADR inexplicably slows the speed from 3 frames per second to an excruciating 3 seconds per frame (after the five-frame buffer is full). Of course ADR can be turned off, however that was one the main reasons I bought the camera.I am also a little disappointed that it so much more expensive than the D40 that it replaces.

Because it's omitted on this model, you have to use the viewfinder all the time. The auto white balance in any camera is quite challenging in fluorescent lighting, but customizations have allowed me to combat that. Low light + high ISO can come out pretty ugly in some situations, even with noise reduction turned on. I'd recommend working on lighting and lens variation for that.In my opinion, the pros outweigh the cons on this camera. I've done some great portrait, landscape, and experimental photography with it so far, and I'm very pleased. Years ago, I took compact cams on my travels around the globe, and they worked great. Some years before, I did some 35mm photography. Getting this camera seemed like a logical step. The price of this camera is awesome for the quality you get. I recommend this camera as an entry level DSLR. However, if you have budget constraints, the D40 & D60 are nearly the same (used models are cheaper). Even a used Canon Digital Rebel will be great. My advice is to go with either Nikon or Canon and stick with that brand so that when you upgrade your camera body, you can use the same lenses. A good camera is a good camera - do some research, learn it, and shoot! For those who have a little cash to spend, and want the movie recording, get something newer and higher end.

I'm an amateur/hobbyist photographer and for a year or so I haven't really been sure what DSLR to get. The Nikon D60 was a great camera, but I just didn't want to be stuck with it's basic 3-point AF system. Now that I've had my D3000 for a while I'm really glad I waited. The 11-point AF system (the same as what's in the D90 and D5000) was really worth the wait. Also, while I wasn't really too sure about the CCD sensor I have no complaints about it and I'm really pleased with image quality. The only problem with the image quality is low light performance, which is not the greatest, but I can't really complain - for the price it's great.The button layout is great (just like all the other Nikons), I really like the 3-inch display, and some of the in-camera editing features have proven to be really useful. Also, though I don't really like compact DSLRs that much, I have to say that once again, Nikon has done a great job at it, and even though it's small, it's really comfortable to hold.

The D3000 solves all those shortcomings by providing, no shutter lag, more accurate and faster autofocus, and oustanding light metering.In one afternoon I took well over 300 pics of downhill ski racers and virtually all were well exposed and in focus.  In post processing I heavily cropped the pics and they still looked fantastic.  This would not have been something easy to do with my point and shoot, and many of the shots would have been impossible with a P&S; camera.

I call myself the perfect buyer of the D3000...I own a Canon point and shoot (SD870 IS) and was generally quite happy with it. I took great pictures of my adventures and of my family and was always happy with the results. I never knew there was a better picture being taken until my friends stood side by side with me and took pictures of the same subject matter with their DSLR cameras. We would all go home, look at our pictures, and sure enough I would see their pics and quickly understand that despite the fact that we were side by side taking the same picture of the same subject matter they ended up with the better picture. I grew frustrated...I'm never going to be a pro, amateur, or even a serious enthusiast of the art of photography, but I DO like to have nice photos...The D3000 was my answer. Without a doubt, this is the best bang for your buck and best entry level DSLR in the market. If you want to 'be serious' (read books) about photography and study that art, well, then maybe a D3000 is going to be a device too simple for your needs. If you are simply looking to make a safe jump from the world of point and shoot into DSLR I highly recommend a D3000. You can read all about features and functions at a variety of sites that I am sure you can find that will go beyond what this forum will provide. Honestly, the knocks I found against it (ex: long record times and max buffer) I have yet to find as an issue in real life photo taking (ex: my highly active 1.5 year old at the playground). The dials are pretty much the same as a point and shoot and the guide mode is cool as well --- It literally took me an hour or two to make the jump into the functionality of this camera.I have owned a digital cameras since 2003 and can attest to the differences of what a point and shoot and a DSLR are capable of rendering.

Bernthal", "ReviewID": "RBG2ZZ94B7KAC", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "This is a great camera for beginners.This is my first DSLR and I've had it for about a month. Since I'm a beginner myself, I can't really speak to the technical aspects of the camera, but will try to cover the basics as much as possible.BUILD QUALITY - This is an entry-level DSLR, so don't fool yourself into thinking that you're buying a robust, professional level camera.  That means that the body and lens (including the lens mount, which is the ring that attaches the lens to the body) are plastic.  Although this makes for lighter equipment, it also isn't generally as sturdy as some of the higher level cameras.  HOWEVER, when I actually went to BestBuy and camera stores, I found that the Nikon cameras (when you actually picked them up in-hand) in this niche felt much sturdier and of much higher quality than the competitors.  Does that mean they'll last longer?  Not necessarily, but for what it's worth, the Nikons really did feel better.FEATURES - In this day and age, this is really a bare-bones DSLR.  The only camera I cross-shopped with this was the D5000.  There are MANY differences between the two, the largest of which is the nicer processor. But don't get fooled!  That doesn't mean that the D3000 can't take great pictures... Anyhow, onto the features. It has a 10MP processor which is more than adequate for me, and the average beginner.  It has a really large screen, which takes up the whole back of the camera almost.  However, as many reviewers have noted, it's not that sharp!  This was probably the biggest disappointment of the camera.  My point and shoots have less-pixelized screens!  But overall, it's not a big deal.  The other minute feature is the Guide Mode.  I've found it to be less than helpful and don't even use it at all anymore, and I've only had it for a month or so.  THE BIGGEST FEATURES that you won't find on the D40/D60 cameras is the ADL feature and the 11 autofocus points... ADL stands for Active D-Lighting, and improves color somehow (the best way I can describe it, and I'm probably technically wrong but, it preserves actual colors better).  The only drawback is that it's relatively slow on the D3000.  The 11 autofocus points is great.  The D40/D60 only has three, and they're all aligned along the same horizontal line, which is right in the middle of the camera.  When composing a shot, ti's nice to be able to set an autofocus point not directly in the middle of the shot.  Anyhow, this camera was appealing to me because of it's bare-bone feature set.  I didn't want Live View or Video, and I'd basically be paying for those features if I were to step up to the D5000.PICTURE QUALITY - Ah, probably the most important aspect of the camera... and I don't know what to say about it!  I'm a beginner, so I don't know what makes a great photo, and DEFINITELY have no idea how this camera shoots vs. another one.  What I've read is that the D3000 shoots relatively noisy pictures, but that it doesn't necessarily preclude you from shooting great photos (by adjusting things like ISO).  I DON'T KNOW THIS FROM EXPERIENCE, JUST WHAT I'VE READ! Oh, and noise is basically random color pixels in a photo.  It doesn't look good.  All I can say is that I'll update this review as I figure it out!RECOMMENDATIONS - If you're a beginner, I'd recommend picking up a book such as \"Understanding Exposure\" by Bryan Peterson. That book, coupled with the D3000 will help you understand the basics of photography and how to use a digital SLR.  Also, get the kit, not just the body!  The price difference is currently $100, and from what I've seen, you can sell the lens itself for more.  Remember, the kit lens has VR, which the D40 and D60 didn't come with. So there are those out there who might want a cheap upgrade (and in DSLR world, $150 for a decent lens is cheap!).Also, the kit lens is great, but in addition to that, I'd recommend the relatively cheap 35mm f/1.8G AF-S DX lens... you should eventually get a prime lens, and for this camera, this is arguably the best one out there, especially for the price. Also2, get a flash that tilts upward so you can bounce it off the ceiling!  I went with the Nikon SB400 and it's worked well so far.CONCLUSION - Like I said, this is a great beginners camera. The great things about it are the 11 autofocus points, ADL option, compact size, great ergonomics and size, build quality, and easy-to-use menu.  The drawbacks are the older processor, plasticky feel (I don't mind it, and furthermore it feels solid), and disappointing screen.  Overall, it's a great camera to purchase if you're thinking about getting into DSLRs... If you find you LOVE photography, it will help you develop as a photographer and understand what you are doing until you're ready to upgrade to something more serious.  If you find that photography is not a hobby for you but just a means to an end, then you have a camera that you can throw into full-auto mode and take better pics than your standard P&S;, and it didn't set you back a ton of $$$.", "Date": "October 29, 2009"}, {"Title": "Incredible first DSLR", "Author": "Sargent", "ReviewID": "RE2S2FXMFVYSJ", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Hey potential buyers!I recently upgraded to the d3000 as my first DSLR. Earlier this year, when we were preparing for our first baby, my husband convinced me to purchase one of the Nikon point-and-shoot super-zoom cameras to save money (he said DSLRs are too difficult to use, anyway). After using the super-zoom for the past few months, I ended up buying this camera anyway because even the super-zoom left me disappointed and wanting. This camera is WELL WORTH the money and the effort, especially now with the release of the d3100.I'll preface this by saying that I am a quick learner and technologically savvy, but this camera is very easy to use. The guide and scene modes are great, but straight out of the box, I found the manual modes (I mainly use M or A) very easy to use. When I ordered the camera, I read up on a few of the important terms that are necessary for understanding how to take good manual pictures. So, while you're waiting for your shipment, google DSLR blogs that explain aperture, shutter, exposure, ISO sensitivity, metering, etc., and it's also helpful to go ahead and take a look at the manual online to get a sense of all of the options you have for focusing. If you understand these basic photography concepts, you'll have no problem getting GREAT pictures in a variety of settings. I've taken superb pictures indoors, outdoors, in good lighting and poor. The auto focusing capabilities are just amazing. Anyone frustrated with point-and-shoots is going to love the control you get.The camera is stable and sturdy, not cheap feeling. The buttons are accessible, convenient, and also feel like quality.I don't have much to say about the flash.... the few pictures I've taken with flash turned out fine, but I honestly don't really use it because you can easily manage exposure with the other settings.Here are some things that aren't issues for me, but be aware of when you purchase the camera:1-No live view: you must look through the viewfinder. I think it's great.2-Any extra lenses you buy must have AF-S in the title. This means that the auto-focusing mechanism is IN THE LENS, not the camera body, so if you want auto focus, you must get an auto-focusing lens. You can still use other lenses, but you'll have to focus manually. I kind of like manually focusing just because it's fun to learn, but the autofocus is great on this camera.If you have any questions or want to see some samples, feel free to contact me.", "Date": "June 10, 2011"}, {"Title": "Great, but one drawback", "Author": "Jens", "ReviewID": "R2Y1KM5KUC0916", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I have to start out by saying if you are a point and shoot user looking to upgrade to a DSLR, keep in mind this camera does not have \"Live View\"!

I bought it right on Christmas a couple years back. It was about $550 normally but for some reason on the day after Christmas, Amazon listed a new one for $440?!?!?! SOOOO, I bought and bought it quick.There's not one complaint at all using it. I use it for my wild life photography where it has been exposed to mud, light rain, dust, dirt, smelly snake musk and everything! The camera has held very well and hasn't had any problems or complaints from me. Below, I'll have a link to my examples of my work using this camera.The kit lense, 18-55mm vr lens, was a great lens for close up and landscapes. To accompany this, I got the 55-200mm lense and mainly use that lense with my D3000. It's the perfect lense for what I need.Here's a break down on the camera:Body/Size:Nice strong body, nothing has broken on my camera, insides stay pretty dust free too, only just last week have I had to clean the camera approx. 20k pictures later. The size is great, its quite a small DSLR compared to others I've viewed at Best Buy/Target etc. The screen is great once calibrated a bit to your liking and has a decent/accurate display. This is the first camera also where I haven't had issues with the battery or sd card doors falling off as well!Speed/Focusing:This camera is rated at 3 frames per second. It's not bad for it's class, when using the Auto Focus lock option you can snap off 5 shots back to back granted you use a decent SD card. Saving time sometimes takes long for 5 shots in a row but it's plenty good for most situations. The focusing system is pretty good for the 11 (?) points it has. Bokehs turn out really nice in my pictures and other focus issues I've learned were on my end and just user error. I've had pretty good luck catching some nice shots of birds flying around or lizards running off and still able to freeze a good, sharp shot. Taking images of very small animals/insects can have some focusing issues but it's probably because I need to get a macro lense!Image Quality:This camera produces some very, very nice shots. I know it takes some skill and the camera is mainly a tool to take the image with, this thing can really produce some photos that look sharp, fine detail and can capture some breath taking images. See my link for my work using this camera: [...]The metering system is awesome, I use it all the time, and rely on it myself. I love it! My post production editing is pretty minimal.Low Light Situations:I only really use this camera for reptiles which require sunlight so I don't really ever use this camera is low light situations. When I do, I do see noise in lower ISO's but I believe it's just my skill level. I have been able to use it with a tripod for some shots at night that did turn out pretty good with higher ISO's and lower shutter speeds but someone else will have to address this area of the D3000.I mainly learned how to take pictures, not using the flash. I can't really rate the flash feature of the D3000 but I don't use it and will not ever either.My opinion on the D3000 vs the D3100:The image quality to me didn't have any differences in my opinion. The fact that the D3100 has the ability to record video doesn't attract me at all. Nikon isn't quite there yet with their video recording from what I've seen/read and the price difference isn't worth it to me. Get the D3000 and use the extra money on a 55-200mm or a 55-300mm lense.A Couple Things That Could of Been Better:Most people wish the camera had \"Live View Mode\" where you aim your camera and see it on the screen. Instead, the D3000 makes you look through the viewfinder. This doesn't really really affect me at all in the field when using this camera. It would be nice for a coupe things but I'm pretty happy with how my camera is and the price I got it for.My biggest thing I wish would happen for the D3000 is some more accessories from Nikon instead of the 3rd party stuff. A Nikon screen protector or battery grip pack would be nice. I'll be trying a battery grip soon, hoping it'll fit right and be durable. Some of the screen protectors I've gotten off ebay were cheap and poor quality. My biggest accessory I wish was able to be used with the D3000 is the GPS unit so I could have coordinates of where I shoot different reptile species at just for my studies and such.For the price, I have no complaints, I will be moving up to the D7000 shortly just for the higher speeds to try new things with and the better quality. I will definitely compare the shots with my D3000 for comparisons and post results under D7000 once I get it and use it enough.Basically, if you read this whole thing, you shouldn't of wasted your time and you better have a confirmation of purchase email in your inbox!

I got it a week ago and have already taken almost 1000 pictures (but thats no problem with my 4 gb extreme 3 memory card!) What can I say! I love photography!! I had a canon powershot sd750 point and shoot and let me tell you that camera was no wimp. It gave me stunning shots while retaining lightness and compactness. But it was starting to limit me a bit. Like all the action shots I would take would come out blurry and outdoor shots of animals and such were no better. So I read up on a lot of dslr's for a long time and finally decided on this one. The day I got it I shot 200 shots. It was ready to use right out of the box! I had recently purchased a 4gb extreme 3 memory card  and that went immeadiately into my camera. I absolutely love this camera. I didn't realize how badly I had been needing a camera like this!! There is a drawback though! I dont know if it is a defect on mine or not but it will only shoot four frames in a burst and then it slows down to one frame per second and at times slower than that. I dont know quite what to do but this is not to much of a drawback! I can get great action shots still with no problem! Anyway I debated a long time whether to get the canon rebel xs or this but this ultimately looked like a better camera. I would highly reccomend it for its ease of use and user friendliness. If your looking for a step up form a point and shoot this is the camera for you! But if you have a d40 or a d60 I would reccomend the d90 as an update for this camera! The d90 is $1100 but is worth every penny! P.S. I will update this review if I find out why it will only shoot four frames in a burst. Edit...If you have active d lighting on it will slow down how fast your camera processes pictures.

I'm not going to tell and compare all those technical details. I need a DSLR camera to take a good picture of my 6 months old kid. She moves a lot. Almost every picture has fuzz/blur in it. As far as DLSR cameras goes, it's pretty much between Cannon or Nikon. Those reviews say quite some users complained mid-range focus issue with Cannon cameras. The fact that Nikon has more AF points is the winning point for me. Then, it came down between D90 and D3000. D90 has rave reviews. It has lots of nice features. But by the time I figure all of them out and use them to my advantage, I can probably buy a twice jem-packed DLSR for the same price. So D3000 is all I need for next couple of years. I don't need those video features on D90 and D5000. I like to keep it simple. When a manufacture jams too much functions into one small device, some performance will have to compromise. D3000 has pretty much everything you need for a DLSR. With current memory and battery capability, you just shoot and shoot, and later you sit down to go through them and pick the best one. Great pictures come from the person who holds the camera, not the camera. A more advanced camera make you to achieve that a little bit easier, but not that much.

Redferin \"Realistic Expectations\"", "ReviewID": "RN69A2FERC4HY", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "After a trip to Biltmore Estate and the resulting disappointment with my point-and-shoot photos, I decided to take the plunge and purchase a quality camera.  Being new to DSLR cameras, I didn't want to spend a lot of money but wanted a camera that would allow me to take better photographs while learning the basics.  This was the perfect choice for me.  I researched other models (Canon, Sony, etc.) and decided on the Nikon based on other users reviews and cameras my friends use.  Other reviewers have gone into great detail on the features so I'll just provide a quick overview.Although the camera doesn't have all the bells and whistles of, say a Nikon D300s, if you're new to DSLRs you don't want too much too soon.  Too many options and features may very well turn you off to photography.  There have been times when even figuring out the features on this camera is overwealming.  Be warned that you will not get a user's guide detailed enough to cover every feature and setting on the camera.  I ended up buying David Busch's D3000 Guide for a more thorough understanding of the camera.  There is a built-in step-by-step feature on the camera that was awesome, but it can't possibly be expected to cover everything the camera does.The D3000 has a full auto mode, and \"quick modes\" for portrait, children, landscape, and the typical point-and-shoot settings, perfect if you have a signifcant other that just wants to take pictures, but not worry about manually setting aperature or shutter speed.  Then there are the \"big boy\" settings:  aperature priority, shutter priority, programed auto, and full manual (arg, arg, arg!).  These settings are the key difference between a pont-and-shoot of the kids you never look at again and a picture you want to hang above your fireplace.If you're new to DSLRs try to grab one of these cameras.  I've been using this for about eight months and have yet to hit the mark where I want to move up in camera.  I do however want better lenses.  The kit lens you get with this camera is great for starting out, but at about the two month mark I hit the plateau of what the camera can do with the kit lens.  A colleague of mine has loaned me his Nikonr 18-55 2.4, Nikon 60mm 2.8 prime and Tokina 11-16 2.8.  What a difference.  Although the camera is still holding its own, the lens will quickly become something you'll want to replace.Be warned, once you begin shooting and reach the limitations of the kit lens, you will want to begin exploring other lens options.  Be prepared to spend mucho bucks!  The difference between the kit lens (18-55 f3.5-5.4) and the Nikon 18-55 f2.8 is staggering.  The 2.8 is faster and sharper than you can possibly hope for with the kit lens, especially in low-light situations.Overall, this camera is a great primer for DSLR photography.  I recently learned that Nikon wil no longer carry the D3000. If you want to take the plunge and learn about DSLR photography, I strongly recommend you try to find one.  Even used, this camera will hold its value and may increase in value.  I would urge you to buy a different strap though.  Nothing says \"steal me please\" more than the Nikon strap that is included.  Grab yourself an Op/TECH Pro strap and shoot away.", "Date": "March 31, 2011"}, {"Title": "Great camera", "Author": "dj", "ReviewID": "R16KAVBF6TSKAC", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I've been using this camera for over 3 years now and it's been great.

I shoot film and with a Nikon D90 and I have to say that I'm pretty impressed with the D3000. I have a pretty extensive and expensive kit but I typically find myself using the D3000 and it's plastic kit lens instead. It's incredibly lightweight and portable (for a DSLR). In good light, the D3000 produces sharp, colorful images that are practically indiscernible to my D90.:: PROS ::- Easy to figure out for beginners- Gives you all of the essentials. Anyone that \"needs\" more features needs to work on their photo skills---not inventory.- Great focusing system- Meters correctly almost every time- Sharp in good light- Light and portable- Very long battery life:: CONS ::- My word is this thing slow. You take a picture and it takes several seconds for it to show you a preview on the back. (Yes, I use a fast, Class 8 card)- Screen is low resolution and pretty dim- ISO performance is only okay. Still miles beyond point and shoots, but it's nothing compared to the D90.- No internal focusing motor. This means that you can't use any older lenses without needing to focus manually. Basically, only buy the newer AF-S lenses.:: SUMMARY ::This is a great camera designed to help people step into the SLR world and get a feel for having more control over a photograph. It won't make you a better photographer but it will give you beautiful, accurately colored, sharp and high resolution photographs (in good light). Despite my ISO \"con,\" it really does perform nicely in low light. Just don't rely on cranking ISO up... get more light instead. I highly recommend this.:: INSTEAD ::If you have a little more money to spend, maybe check out the D5000 instead. Still no internal focusing motor, but it gives you a better screen, video capabilities, and the same image sensor that's in the D90.:: ALSO BUY ::The kit lens that comes with this, while dinky and plastic, is actually pretty terrific. I'd also recommend checking out the Nikon 35mm f/1.8G AF-S for better low light performance and a shallower depth of field. People always notice shallow depths of field, like it, don't know how to explain it, and say \"you have a great camera.\" It's the lens, not the camera.", "Date": "July 20, 2010"}, {"Title": "excellent", "Author": "Daryl", "ReviewID": "RKYCBVERFSYGD", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I've really enjoyed this camera and was an excellent purchase.

Even though there are some I've read that are completely opinionated, the overall consensus is correct in that this entry level DSLR is fantastic at pictures, and very easy to learn.  Is it top of the line?  Absolutely not.  But every photo I've taken with it has been magazine quality, according to everyone who has seen my photo's including local photography guru's.  I would say the only downside to this camera is low light photography.  It's a challenge, but with some steps can be overcome.  For example, night soccer games I would shoot would be nothing but blurry.  However after purchasing a f/2.8 70-200mm lens, shots turned out much better.

I got this camera for Christmas and out of the box I had to say I was a little disappointed. The camera just did not take super sharp pictures like I had seen other peoples DSLR's take. Using auto function you end up with photos little better than a regular point and shoot. The kit lens is not a bad lens and you can get better images correctly using Shutter, aperture priority or manual mode over auto. But to really unlock this cameras true potential you need to invest in the Nikkor 35mm 1.8G Prime lens. It is $200 (although due to the Tsunami you may have a hard time finding it at the moment). Once I got this lens the quality of the images I took increased immensely. I found myself just photographing whatever was lying around because the detail and sharpness was amazing (best if you shoot on Aperture mode dialed down to around 2.2 or 2.5).This lens is the only one that stays on my camera now.

I never thought I would own anything other than a Canon because I was a long time Canon user. I wasn't really sure which way I would lean until I grabbed a hold of both of them in my hands at a store. I liked the way the Nikon felt in my hands. Canon just felt cheap. I've also considered Nikon d5000, but I wasn't ready to commit myself to paying that price tag for a few extras features for a beginner. For someone that is just delving into dslr and photography, I love it. I want to take photography classes so I can learn even more and improve my skills.I get frustrated with the camera sometimes, but it's only because of my inability to understand what each function does and how to use it. I have more learning to do, which requires more patience. Now, I find myself going on random trips around Southern California just so I can take pictures and just use my camera. I take it everywhere. I know I would own this for years, but when that time comes it would be another Nikon (and it's not just because I have Nikon lenses). I love their quality. I've converted.My only peeve, although minor, is that it doesn't have live view. I knew this going in. I thought it wouldn't be a problem because I do prefer the eye view finder, but I do take pictures with the point of view from the ground. Without live view, I really don't know what I'm taking a picture of, and I choose not to lay on the ground to find that out.

User FRIENDLY, GUIDE MODE IS A MUST! The whole camera is FILLED with tips and EXAMPLES and settings of what to do and how to achieve such and such. Guide mode holds your hand for newbies to give you an idea of whats what, i love how the Nikon D3000 is Half a book and All camera! Thanks Nikon for making such a great quality camera.2. Takes Great pictures, as an entry level dslr it takes great pictures but i think its the same sensor as the d60 just with 11 points of focus , the 11 point focus is definitely useful, theres more areas for your subject to be in, and Depth of field pictures are definitely easier to do with more focus points.The Nikon d3000 with the 18-55mm lens is perfect for everyday use but not enough, i suggest it should be complimented with a 55-200mm, because sometimes you cannot get close enough to the subject without getting in the way of the people around you!The Screen is big and wide and perfect for reviewing images and looking at settings, you dont have to look hard. The settings do get washed out in direct sunlight so try to keep it in your shadowAlso post processing of pictures comes out AWESOME!!! i could not believe the level of detail i saw on my computer, it wasnt blurry and zooming in is really pixel squares.Nice camera for beginners, if your novice or pro this camera isnt for you, while a newbie like me appreciate the tips it does take a while to get around the settings but you get used to it, there is no quick access to any 1 setting but soon your fingers will be faster than any other photographer, once you get used to all the navigating.ALSO this is a camera where you can customize the background of your screen! you can have a wallpaper of a picture or change the color.I hope this is a comprehensive review that will satisfy you into buying the camera :D", "Date": "January 1, 2010"}, {"Title": "EXCEEDED MY EXPECTATIONS", "Author": "diegOdariO SnapShotS \"diegOdariO SnapShotS\"", "ReviewID": "R1D7WT6XDPFUXE", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I haven't stopped taking pictures since I got it.

I am impressed with the Retouch features that will make a photo brighter, take out any red eye, do a color balance to your perfection (remember, the purple color of a lilac is just about impossible to capture but you can get that defined color with the color balance feature on the Nikon D3000), or trim a photo to take out any unwanted scenery or subjects.I took photos of my Christmas tree at night and the pictures are spectacular and the multi-color lights cast their hues to their true colors.Sure, there is the competition that gives you 19 scene modes, but really, the only two you need are Auto and Auto no flash.  If you are at a fireworks display or at an aquarium, the auto no flash is all you need.Who wants a movie mode with a camera?

If there are disadvantages to owning this bundle, those disadvantages would be that the accompanying Nikon carrying case could have been larger than the supplied case. A larger case would leave room for additional lenses, flash and light-meter. Moreover, the Nikkor lenses do not have \"VR\" or vibration reduction setting as demonstrated in the accompanying videos.The Nikon D3000 is my first semi-professional camera. I use the phrase 'semi-pro' because although the camera, in some circles, is touted as a 'beginner's camera' one move quickly from that beginner's tag to utilize the Nikon D3000 SLR's advanced camera features.I watched the accompanying videos over and over, as I used the camera in Guide and auto mode to take excellent photos. The clarity of the photos and perfect exposures I received satisfied my beginner's sweet-tooth and had me craving for competence in the use of shutter and aperture priority.Prior to owning this camera, I was ignorant of the difference between an F-stop and a full stop. No longer. I taught the latter as an ELA teacher, and the former is now a permanent aspect of my new vocabulary, along with words like exposure, aperture  and shutter speed. The camera's use fosters a new sense of 'semi-pro' confidence on one's way to real 'semi-pro' status and photographic shooting competence.The Nikkor zoom lenses are of excellent quality and I started developing a preference for the 55 - 200 mm telephoto lens due to the subject detail I could capture. The interior of the carrying case has compartments that can hold all of the equipment. However, if you add additional telephoto and macro lens as I did when I bought the bundle, a new carrying case automatically appears on your horizon. The battery, battery charger, and memory card round out the bundle and are of excellent quality.On a scale of 1 - 10, the bundle is a 10. Therefore, if you are new to the photographic experience and desire to improve your photographic skills as well as to develop new ones, this is the perfect first semi-pro camera for you: The cost is right, the equipment is excellent, and your skills... well, all you need do is keep taking better and better pictures.", "Date": "March 1, 2013"}, {"Title": "Excellent!", "Author": "snc4", "ReviewID": "R1EQSSY6KS0DOB", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I love this camera.

Unfortunately after 3 weeks I was left wanting... Advice: if you are bitten by the photo bug you might quickly outgrow this camera! I have several problems with this camera, however I am also frequently blown away by the picture quality of my photos.I shoot primarily in aperture priortiy after owning this camera for about 6 weeks. The guide mode seemed pointless after about the first week. If you are at all interested in fundamentals of photography, you'll quickly outgrow the guide mode and shoot in A, P, S or M.The white balance has been tricky for low light indoor photos. I have mostly been shooting with the Nikon AF-S Nikkor 35mm 1:1.8G DX for portraits of family. I rarely have to use a flash and when I do use the flash, white balance and color accuracy is really good. The real problem is in flashless low light situations. Most of the time the temp is way too yellow with indoor incandescent lighting and in camera editing can't quite fix it. I've used the white balance preset for the nursery, but when going to the living room (different temp) there's not a great option, so I either have to try the incandescent preset or hope to fix the temp in post processing (either in camera or with Win 7). IMO, auto white balance in low light situations is not good.ISO is almost unusable above 800 due to grain, unless converting to black/white and comfortable with a lot of noise. However with the f1.8 35mm prime, I'm usually able to get away with <800 ISO. When shooting with the kit lens (18-55 f3.5-5.6) you'll need a brightly lit room or the flash.There are very few programmable buttons. I have the Fn button set to adjust white balance and really wish there was an ISO button. i'd also like bracketing, but that's probably asking too much from this entry level camera.Despite the issues with poor white balance and ISO performance, this camera is an exceptional value. In decent light situations with my 35mm prime, I am consistently blown away by the picture quality and color accuracy.IMO, if you have the sneaking suspicion you'll want a little more out of your camera in the near future (for me about 1 month), you may want to skip the d3000 and move up to the d5000 or d7000. If you want a basic, entry level DSLR that is easy to use and will blow away most POS cameras, look no further.

I originally purchased the Canon G10, which was the top-of-the-line point when I bought it. I paid almost as much at the time as I did for my D3000. Back then, I thought at the price I paid, I would get SLR quality with the G10 point and shoot. Although I still love my G10 for a grab-and-go camera, it is still just a point and shoot without the ability to get SLR-quality pictures. This D3000 is my first SLR and I am so glad I have both a point and shoot and an SLR. I purchased my D3000 with the Nikor 70-200 lens (for sporting events - glad I did). My neighbor bought a D90 and we compared picture quality of identical objects we took pictures of. My D3000 measured up to the D90 is almost every picture! I can't take video like the D90, and granted, the D90 is a far more advanced camera meant for more seasoned photographers who can afford it.If you are looking for an amazing camera with spectacular, professional pictures without spending a ton, this camera is perfect. I don't fully understand the manual settings yet (still learning), but the D3000 has several preset settings that I use all of the time and they work very well.

You can work your way to more complicated and satisfying uses at your own pace, and yet use it right away as a \"point and shoot.\"  For my purposes, just perfect.Cameta Photo service was great - on time and well-packed.  They followed up with a satisfaction e-mail.  I have not had to use their services again as nothing has gone wrong, but they seem to be professional and concerned.

Easy to use.2. controls well laid out3. Kit lens AF quick and silent.4. Size reasonable for small hands (mine).5. Ability to take Nikon 'F' mount lenses (AF or not).While there is the occasional 'oops' moment, errors are easily corrected, and, of course, being digital, errors deleted with no expense incurred. Can't say that about film cameras.In addition to the kit lens, I have bought from a friend his Sigma 70-300 lens. While it is designated as an AF lens, as it does not have it's own motor, it isn't on the D3K. Manual focusing is a bit of a pain, as is having to learn how to do it all over again. But when I get it right WOW! Nice crisp image.The only real criticism is not about the camera itself, a star performer. It is that lack of a REAL manual. The 60 page 'manual' merely highlights the cameras' many controls and menus and does not go into detail about them. The Main manual is a  216 page PDF  file loaded onto a PC and called a Reference manual. I call it the Users Manual, and the little 60 page thing a Quick Reference. The 'Dummys' book I bought on the D3K has a lot of useful information but having a PRINTED manual would have been better than having to buy my own hard copy.", "Date": "January 7, 2010"}, {"Title": "Impressed!", "Author": "C.

As a college students, I was beyond happy to save the money.The features include almost anything I need (there's only one feature missing: a color selection tool that my dad's Canon has but the D3000 doesn't) and the portability is incredible. I am still in shock about how light the camera is.For a beginner like me, having the D3000 with an extra telephoto lens is perfect for learning the ropes and hopefully taking a photography class with.

After going through a lot of reviews, questioning my friends with DSLRs already and knowing my budget I purchased the D3000.  I was not disappointed.  I am no expert on photography and am frequently going to webpages and books to see the best ideas for certain shot situations but this camera so far has done very well for me.  It gives you everything you would need to start out and learn the functions.  it is slightly lighter than a lot of the the other SLRs out there which for me is excellent since I travel a decent amount and makes carrying it around these places no problem.  One thing I thought could have been better is the Guide mode which pretty much is an easier way to use the different settings (portrait, landscape, etc) modes on your camera, and if you don't know how to set the camera in these modes already then maybe you should either do some more reading, or go back to your point and shoot (which also has some of these functions).

Williams", "ReviewID": "RZ0EKB92L83WJ", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "After much research I narrowed my choices down to the Canon TOS and the Nikon--looking to spend under $500. I didn't need a high megapixel rating so I chose the (discontinued?) D3000.I had used a Nikon 35mm for many years and loved the sharpness of their lenses. When I discovered that the Canon was in short supply just before Christmas, I ordered the Nikon.It has many more features than I'll ever use. The camera seems to be of quality construction and is a bit bulky and heavy, as one would expect from a DSLR. I was happy that it could use the 52mm lens accessories from my 35mm Nikon. I often use a polarizing filter for outdoor scenic shots.My main complaints are:1 - The flash is very weak with fall-off at just a few feet. If you're going to shoot a lot of pics indoors you'd better get an add-on flash (it has a hotshoe.)Pictures tend to come out with orange skin tones (usually correctable using computer software.)2 - Lens sharpness is just average. I hate to say it but my cheaper Canon Powershot A1000IS takes sharper pics at 2 mp than the Nikon. Also, the Canon has more \"snap\" with brighter colors. This can be adjusted in my computer, but why should I have to?3 - Manual focus in semi-dark or very cloudy conditions can be tricky. I shot some pics in the rain and many of them were blurry (I assume from camera shake.) This surprised me, but is correctable I suppose if I change ISO settings.4 - Getting the supplied carrying strap on it is a major undertaking. I finally gave up, threw it away, and used the neck strap off my old 35mm Nikon with metal snaps.My opinion may change after more than a couple of sessions, but with 40 years of camera experience, I doubt it.Some of you may find this to be nit-picking so you should make your own decisions and carefully study other user reviews.Would I buy this camera again? The answer is probably not.

First of all, this is a very nice starter and affordable DSLR for any beginner photographer like myself. Before I got this camera I had very little experience in taking good photos; normally I was just the one to get a compact flash camera to use on our family trips. However the sad thing about this camera is that I didn't know that it didn't have video recording capabilities. So if you are able to spend a little extra money on a new DSLR, then I would advise you to go with getting a D3100. Now, time to do the pros and cons of the camera:-----Pros:- very affordable- very good image quality- very easy to use and not very complicated- very well made; (didn't get too damaged when it fell onto a hard tile floor from four feet)- battery life is decent- portable-----Cons:- flash isn't the best- the strap that comes with it isn't good (the camera fell after the strap came lose around my neck)- no video recording capabilities- not very good indoorsOverall this is a very nice camera with a very nice lens.

D5000 also has scene mode (more standard shooting modes like on beach/snow, pets, etc) and has CMOS sensor along with video at 720p.So, while this camera is all right, I'd suggest D5000 if you can afford it (especially if you're an amateur photographer like me).", "Date": "December 3, 2009"}, {"Title": "Useless indoors, extreme shutter delay (half-second, at least) means you'll miss the shot", "Author": "E.

I got this for work, since we needed a good camera for marketing purposes, and it's atrocious. It has a LONG shutter delay - at least half a second, maybe longer - which means you WILL miss many shots - smiles will be fading smiles, IF YOU HAVE KIDS FORGET IT, etc... I did a three-day photo shoot - about 2,000 images - inside our building, with excellent professional supplemental lighting, etc and very very few of the images are usable, even with exposure correction in Photoshop.

You might read criticisms about this camera based on the fact that it isn't the latest technology.  Semi pro cameras costing over a thousand dollars from just a few years ago used the same imaging chip and their images where considered top-notch then.  The nature of the technology (CCD chip as opposed to CMOS chip) means that this camera cannot take movies or show your subject beforehand on its screen.  This is not a defect - it's just the nature of this technology.  Those writing critical reviews because the camera is not physically capable of doing what they want should have read the specifications more closely.  The fact is that this technology is far more capable than most of the people who use it, making it a good affordable camera to learn on.

This review is more for people that never owned a DSLR camera and may not know what they are getting into. I am just a person that wanted a good camera to take great pictures. This is not a great camera for someone that travels a lot and wants to take a camera because it is quite big and heavy. Some situations need quite the adjusting to get a descent picture. And in low light the camera is pretty much useless.Pros:- Takes awesome action shots outside. (I have two dogs and the pictures of them playing and running around the backyard came out AWESOME!- I was also able to take great black and white pictures inside, but you have to play with the settings for quite some time before taking a picture.- The menu has a beginners guide that kind of guides you through the settings. But again - do you really want to have to set up the camera each time before you take a picture?Cons:- The flash is useless. But you can buy a separate flash.- If you try to take pictures of a person with dark complexion the person will look a lot darker on the pictures. That happens to me inside and outside. I am pretty pale but it actually gives me a nice tan. lol.- Its bulky and heavy to a point I don't want to take it with me anywhere on vacation.- The lens it comes with has barely any zoom. It zooms somewhat if the object is close by, but if you want to take a picture of something in a distance it will not zoom in much at all. My daughters $100 camera has a much better zoom than this one. As a matter of fact my Iphone 4s has a much better zoom than this camera - or I should say the lens it comes with.PS: You can buy a zoom lens for $250 and up though to fix that problem!- It has no video function even though the menu and manual have video option. Booooooo!- You can not use the view finder on the display. You have to go way back in time and put your eye on the camera. Talking about old school lol.To sum it up! I am not gonna say its a garbage camera. Its possible that a professional photographer that knows how to set all the settings ISO etc and has the time to set the camera before each picture will take some great pictures. However, this is NOT for the average person that wants to take the camera on vacation and take family vacation pictures on the go. Its too big and complicated. If you want to get into photography this may be a good camera because it has the beginners menu that will assist with the settings.If you want a everyday camera I would advice you to find a Point-and-Shoot camera. This is what I did after 3 years of having this sitting in my closet collecting dust and only come out for taking pictures of my dogs playing outside every now and then. I did take it with me on some vacations where it usually stayed in the room because nobody wanted to carry it around. lol. Plus my daughter was getting irritated that I always wanted to take her camera on vacation with me lol.So again - it may be a great camera for getting into professional photography but for the average Joe just get something normal. You will save a lot of money and get the pictures that you want. I am going to keep this thing and who knows maybe one day when I retire I may have the time to learn everything about ISO and shutter speed and what not which is required to know if you want to get your money worth out of this camera. ;)Yes you can set it on Auto and point and shoot but the pictures will not always come out as you expected.", "Date": "February 5, 2013"}, {"Title": "on to digital", "Author": "D.

So, I'm new to photography and i decided to buy it because of the awesome deal. When i went to buy it the sales guy told me that they had no more. so he sold me the display version for 30% off so i ended up getting it for $210 then a $30 3 year warranty to make sure it nothing goes wrong. so far its pretty awesome.  and i ended up buying better lens for it, the 55-300 lens for $359.Pros:Takes amazing pictures if used properly, so you don't need an expensive camera like a nikon D7000 to make terrific pictures, just the right accessories. You just have to know how to use the nikon D3000 to make great pictures. What i did is i got the nikon accessory bag that came with a nikon school dvd. I highly highly recommend for all beginners to get it. i got it for $50. the bag is terrific to hold cleaning supplies, other lenses and flash accessories. After you get the bag, please watch the video! It is gold for anyone new or even intermediate to photography. As i mentioned i am pretty new and after watching a 160min video i felt like a pro. it explains anything and everything one would want to know about photography. I loved it.Next, the 18-55ml lens is terrific, but, after about an hour or basically after watching the video,  you will realize that those lenses are just not strong enough and you will find yourself needing a stronger lens. I recommend getting the nikon 55-200ml lens. They come with VR, which is vibration reduction, so when your hands shake the photo is not affected, it is amazing. You can get these lenses for $200. I went a little further and got the 55-300ml lens for $360 just so i can have the extra distance which is useful for far away things such as animals, buildings, or people. Also, memory card is not included with the camera. The max is 8GB. I recommend that one because you never know how many pictures you will have, plus it is only $30. Finally, to complete your set would be a decent flash. For flash i would just recommend searching around here on amazon and see which would best fit your photographic needs. As for me i plan on getting a flash soon but haven't found one yet.Cons: Not much but it is difficult to take pictures at night because i still haven't gotten the hang of it. And by at night i don't mean of people i mean pictures of buildings or cars or just places. Other than that i LOVE this camera.

I got the D3000 body, and two lenses, the 18-55mm AF-S DX NIKKOR f/3.5-5.6G VR, and 55-200mm AF-S DX VR Zoom-NIKKOR f/4-5.6G IF-ED. For the past 4 years I have been using this camera non-stop, as it plays a large role in my college studies. I highly recommend the D3000 based on the following:  1. Guide Mode: a tutorial-like setting, which walks you through how to get a certain type of shot  ( lighting, shutter, aperture, etc). This mode is great for beginners, who are still trying to figure  out their cameras.  2. Battery life: The battery lasts for about 1400 pictures at the highest quality setting(RAW).  3. Image Clarity: Ignore what you hear about this camera being \"entry-level quality\". This camera is  capable of capturing incredibly sharp, crisp, vivid imagery. (Almost as good as some of your higher  quality camera, when in the right hands!)  4. Low Price: When you consider the vast amount of amazing features that this camera offers, the list  price is truly a steal. Especially if you buy a used model in good condition.  5. Comfort: I have used both Nikon as well as Canon products, and personally feel that the Nikon models  feel better in the hands while shooting. This model in particular is very light weight and compact.I use my D3000 mostly for children, animals, night clubs, HDRs, and extreme action sports such as bmx and snowboarding.  This camera can handle almost anything you throw at it, and when additional pieces are used (external flash, external lenses) this camera really delivers.My only negative thought about this camera is that I wish it had a video option like most of the higher end models. But as an entry level DSLR, I have no complaints towards the Nikon D3000.", "Date": "February 8, 2013"}, {"Title": "Great Camera!", "Author": "Jonel", "ReviewID": "R192K8VYUKJ29D", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I got my camera just in time for my class!!

There is no video function, which seems standard for most cameras, let alone one of this price. Relatively low MP considering I have paid half as much for other cameras with 12-14MP. I wish I would have just bought the D3100 which seems to have rectified all of the issues I mentioned as well as others mentioned by more experienced photographers. I needed a new camera, this one was on sale and came with everything I needed to get a bit more serious with my photography (just a hobby and way to record my world travels), so I bought it, but it makes more sense to shell out the extra $50-$60 and get the D3100, which is a much better camera but did not go on sale until AFTER this one arrived. Of course you will lose out on the \"bundle\" deal (case, extra lens, memory card and DVD's) but you will want a much larger memory card anyway (and they are pretty cheap) you can get the lens you actually want (I wish it came with a wide angle or something) and a case that would fit to what ever lenses/filters and such you do decide to get.That being said, the case is great, relatively large, but it fits everything nicely. The memory card is a decent size (8GB, but you could buy a 32GB or higher for next to nothing).

So we gave up on the idea of a \"nice point-and-shoot\" and bought a real camera. We leave it on full auto 99% of the time and the pictures look amazing compared to your last point-and-shoot. We get instant response from the shutter and the colors look really good even indoors at night with flash (a little dim, tiny yellow, but miles above what we were used to).I do wish it had video capabilities as I would love to see what that looks like. Also, at first I wished you could frame your shot on the LCD screen, but once you get used to a view finder (been a long time since I used one) you tend to prefer it.The kit is nice, you get the two lenses you really need. I might eventually pick up a prim lens, but no real need for anything else. The memory card is high quality (class 10) so photos are not slowed down by slow write speeds (the Walmart version of this kit has a slower card). The bag is just big enough for the body, two lenses, and recharger...so no wasted space, but you'll need a bigger bag if you plan to grow your lens collection.This camera exceeded my expectations on image quality given its \"entry level\" status in the DLSR world. In my opinion, it is the perfect camera for the non-enthusiast who just wants good photos WITHOUT having to spend a fortune on equipment, wheel around a camera suitcase and spend a ton of time learning how to operate a camera.

Good with outdoor photography or portraits.", "Author": "SuperPhotoPerson \"SPP\"", "ReviewID": "RB5SVU5CKU39J", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "First off, If you're considering buying this camera for a starter, go for it. The price is great. Don't be turned away by the lack of features or the \"low\" megapixels, because it's good to start simple at first. If you take your time figuring out the controls of the camera, you can shoot photos that will stand out, photos that are much better than a phone camera or point and shoot will give you. It isn't about the equipment, it's about the person.  This camera is all a beginner would need. It is lacking video recording, live view, and some other small features. These aren't needed to take photos. A video recorder is used to take videos. A camera is used to take pictures. If you think you need live view-you don't. You won't find a professional photographer that uses live view, for a reason.  As far as comparing this to a similar Canon entry level DSLR, you will find in these lower end cameras that Canons, when used in full automatic, take harsher photos. Nikon takes warmer photos. I have used several Canon entry level cameras, and several Nikon entry level cameras. They both have a strong build quality, but Canons seem more sensitive to constant use. I've seen Canon's that have the grips peeling off, etc.  This camera's sensor generates quite a bit of noise. Anything above 400 and it gets obvious. I always shoot with my ISO at 100, and even at 100, sometimes when it's dark and the room, you can see noise in shadows. The shutter speed is not a problem, 3 fps is plenty to capture a shot. The problem is the buffer. Even with a class 10 card, it takes anywhere from 5 to 10 seconds to clear off the buffer of the 3 pictures taken in that second.  Auto focus is extremely slow. One benefit, the camera comes with an auto focus light assist. Otherwise, the camera takes 2 to 3 seconds of hunting back and forth in order to focus, and even after that, half the time it's on the wrong subject. This isn't my lens, it's the software in the camera. Just the other day I was waiting for a large butterfly I spotted out front to land on a flower so I could capture it. I immediately switched to aperture priority, and knocked my aperture size up to about f5. The butterfly landed, and I quietly moved over to position my camera by the flower. I looked in the viewfinder, and saw the most awesome shot. Of course, it was out of focus, so I went to focus it. The auto focus missed, so I tried again. By the time it locked in on the flower, the butterfly was gone and flying down the street. I would have used manual focus, obviously, if I knew that was going to happen.  The appearance of the camera is nice, being so compact. With the included lens, the weight is pretty much evenly balanced with the battery in the camera. The camera is quite a bit lighter than the majority of DSLR's, which is nice. I've dropped the actual camera once, trying to carry it and change lenses while walking. It hit the corner, and I was sure I had damaged it. I picked it up, and everything worked just fine. It left a small (3mm or so) impression in the case. I've used this camera in damp conditions before, it has no problem.  Battery life is pretty good. It will last for about 1000 raw photos without the flash, and about 200 raw photos with the flash. Recharge time is amazing, it only takes about 3 hours on Nikon's quick charger. I do not take mass photos, I see quality being more important than mass, so the battery lasts quite a long time. I've thought about buying an off brand battery grip in order to take portrait photos easier and improve my current battery life.  The onboard flash is horrible. It doesn't work well as an actual flash, and it doesn't illuminate the scene very well. It eats battery life. I bought the Neweer TT560 Speedlight, Neewer TT560 Flash Speedlite For Canon/Nikon Digital SLR Cameras, and it works so much better. Sometimes I will even use the onboard flash just to trigger the Neweer flash, knowing it will hardly effect the photo as long as I adjust the power output from the Neweer flash to compensate. Works great as an off camera bounce flash.  As far as the lens, it's good for portraits and some macro photography. It has a very nice bokeh and a large aperture. It isn't a \"low quality\" lens just because it comes as a kit. Of course, being an 18-55mm lens, it doesn't have very much range. I like to shoot a little bit of sports, mostly baseball which is quite stationary, so I bought Nikon's 55-200mm f/4 ED VC AF lens. It preforms pretty well. Wish it had a larger aperture, but anything above f/4 and you have to pay, quite a bit more. If you're worried about CA, or vignetting, I haven't seen any. This lens is sharp, and has crisp colors. Quality is iffy, after the first year or so the auto focus started making a terrible noise if you accidentally touched the focus ring while it was focusing. When I say touch, I mean touch. Not restricting. Just touching it. It makes a horrible screeching sound. It's worked and given me no problems but the screeching sound, so It may or may not be a problem. I don't know yet.  Over all, the camera is good for entry level, and you won't need to upgrade until you start doing low light shooting. You can spend thousands on lenses and put them on this camera, they will work fine and you will realize that 10 megapixels is all you need unless you are doing major cropping or huge prints. After three years of owning it, it is showing no signs of anything wrong with the body itself. I expect to use this camera for several more events. I have shot several baseball seasons with it, several holidays, several basketball games, some more sports, and other similar stuff. It serves its purpose as a camera, and it does it well. I would have given this review five stars if the small problems with the lens never showed up, the flash preformed better, the auto focus preformed better, and the sensor didn't show as much noise as it does.", "Date": "December 11, 2011"}, {"Title": "Review for Nikon D3000", "Author": "danv", "ReviewID": "RIN0OTAZF7HI2", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "The nikon D3000 is a great buy for someone new so DSLR photography, or someone looking to buy a cheap DSLR camera.

Even so I was tempted to score it down to 3 stars instead of 4 for one issue that was not apparent to me when I first started using the camera.  More on this later.It is so easy to operate that even if you do not wish to make any effort beyond the built in guide mode you should quickly find you start to learn something of the basics of digital photography.  The image quality is high and I did not find anything particularly wrong with the noise at high ISO's that others have complained about.  Being a beginner to DSLR's (as I am sure most people considering this camera are) I think you will probably find it an improvement on whatever point and shoot camera you have been using and leave it at that. OK - I know that \"not knowing any better\" is hardly a good excuse for what others have claimed is a camera flaw - but the bottom line for me is that noise at high ISO's did not spoil my enjoyment of the camera.With the addition of a couple of lenses (a fast 35mm prime and a telephoto) I have found I was able to get good quality pictures while doing everything from taking snapshots around the house to tripod mounted landscapes and at one point I even made a make shift light box and experimented with some product photography.  In all of these activities, while I was often reminded the D3000 was an entry level camera (e.g. no exposure bracketing), I cannot say I ever felt cheated or completely prevented from doing anything I wanted to do.So why consider given the camera 3 stars?  Something I did not initially notice but which has started to spoil my enjoyment of the camera is the slow operating speeds when the active d lighting feature is switched on.  Active D lighting is a really useful feature that helps improve pictures taken in high contrast situations - something I find myself doing more and more often.  In these circumstances the camera operation is so slow as to be useless for any sort of active target shooting (like kids and/or pets playing).  These are the scenes I have the opportunity to shoot at the moment ... and the D3000 makes it harder and less fun than it should be.So, I would probably chose a different (more expensive) camera if I were to make the same decision today. But I feel the D3000 does such a great job at such a good price in all the other scenarios I have used it, that I think it is worth 4 stars.

I take it everywhere. It is extremely easy to use. I also purchased the Nikkor 55-200mm VR lens. I now am able to take stunning pictures. I took night photos of the Las Vegas strip, amazing. The animals at the San Diego Zoo photgraphed beautifully. I started out just using it in Auto mode. This past Fourth of July I took the leap into Manual mode and simply loved it. The pictures I took of the fireworks are fantastic.

This way, I can choose my favorite shots and share them immediately, as well as save a few for more advanced editing if I have the time.The camera does a good job of allowing you to have a range of control.

Why?  Well, he said something almost mystical: the Nikon pictures were more \"involving\" --- they invited the viewer into the scene.I've found the same to be true with my Nikons.

Right away, I charged up the battery which only took an hour and 30 min. and then I started shooting away at my kids playing and my pets. I also took a couple of macro pics which turned out nice and detailed - considering these were shot using the AUTO mode and in the evening - indoors. I find this camera quite satisfying for my everyday needs - a definite step up from my Canon point and shoot - I still use those for social settings and not bulky. The D3000 learning curve is easy when you use the auto mode, but the guide mode helps too for more features - then you have the manual mode which I am interested in for those cutom shots. The camera is not that heavy and fits nicely on my hands. The battery life is good - but always have a spare - which should be standard these days. There is NO video mode so keep that in mind...whats the point? And I heard the video mode for the D5000 is an after thought. This is stricly still photos, folks!

A very significant and surprising disappointment.Thankfully, the D3100 is much better.  Spend a bit more get this or the D5100.  You'll have better pics, typical DSLR speed, and peace of mind.  The D3000 was not Nikon's best product.

However, I do not have this feeling when I use this D3000. I only took some photos around my house inside and out using auto mode. So far, I feel everything is so so. The picture is not good at all if light is dim. I think I can get a better pictures just using my black berry phone camera.I did try the N55 28 to 80mm G len with the D3000. As I was told, it dose not work. Some say that old len can work with manual mode. I have not figured out how to use it yet.Originally I was thinking only to buy the D3000 camera body only and buy a 55-200mm lenses separately.

With the D60, I typically always used to shoot at f10-f16 at ISO800 with in body flash to get a better DOF and D60 did a very good job of handling & suppressing the noise at ISO800, however with this D3000, the pictures at ISO 8000 are turning out to be garbage with too much noise showing. If you are interested in only potraits, you might be OK but for shots where some subjects are 4-5 ft behind others in indoor settings, this camera is going to make it virtually impossible to take good pictures in that setting.The quality of the LCD screen seems to have dropped too..This is going back, I think I am going to order another D60 while it is still available.", "Date": "November 16, 2009"}, {"Title": "I wish I would have known this before I picked Nikon over Canon!", "Author": "tphdrum", "ReviewID": "R3OBNZZCJPF4EP", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "This camera is great until you decide to buy more lenses.

The new sensor suggests a decent increase in image quality (more resolution/higer ISO' improved processing)over previous entry models (D40-D40x-D60-D3000). If you want usable DSLR video and if the image quality pans out the way it should, then this is the entry model for you.  If you don't care about the video, then the D40 is still the way to go - though the D3000 has dropped in price, so maybe not so objectionable now depending on the price, condition.  .02----original review-----------A. Little is right if you're going to treat this DSLR as a fancy P&S; camera, but I think the point of buying a camera of this type (as opposed to some of the cheaper P&S;'s) should include: being able to get better IQ, take faster action shots and to shoot in darker conditions.  We can't minimize the D3000's reduced noise handling ability in relation to the less expensive and older D40 it purports to replace (the third such attempted replacement, I may add) ([...]).  You simply can't take good indoor shots (or darker) without ugly flash glare or more expensive lighting at ISO 200 on these models (can you do it at 400?).  In addition, I challenge any hobbyist to be able to tell the differnece between the D3000's \"faster frame rate\" and the D40 in actual use (3fps v. 2.5fps); you'd have to go to 5 or 6 fps and a higher baffle before you get a workable difference, at least for my hard-earned $$. (One of the greatest cameras of all time, the Canon 5D Mark II, barely does 5fps).  The D3000's GUIDE Mode will annoy anyone who actually learns the relationship between ISO, Aperature, and Shutter Speed and while useful for a newbie, not something you'd want to use for too long. The D3000's LCD is slightly larger physically, but the resolution isn't really increased from the D40 so the image produced isn't all that fetching; it's not bad, but it doesn't exactly add to its buy-me factor, either.  Does this make the D3000 a bad camera?  Of course not, its a good camera, but you can still get a NEW D40 for less and maybe we can't blame Nikon using fluff to try to boost its newbie/Noob sales or because it can't coax the same noise handling ability from its larger sensor.Finally, yeah, the D3000 does have a few more MP's, but so did the D40x and so does the D60 and so do MANY P&S;'s...and they're still selling new D40's (and oh yeah, the D3000 is dropping to where it (along with its great VR lens) almost matches the D40's price and my earlier arguments become a bit moot)...don't buy into the MP Hype the sales people use to sell camera's (don't be a Noob); unless you are printing larger than 16x20 posters, 6 MP is all you will ever need, and its not a reason (by itself) to give up your hard earned $$.

It seemed like I had to go through alot of steps to change WB, ISO and shutter speed.when I first started using this camera I thought I would like the info button, which is supposed to explain what some of the features do. However I found it to bring up more questions than it answered. (bottom line here is, you still need to purchase a manuel to better understand how WB,ISO, Metering and exposure truely effect a shot!)On a positive note the camera works great in Auto mode and the preset functions work quite well. The camera takes Excellent photos in daylight and in well lit situations.

This camera does not honor Nikon's reputation. It has a plastic flimsy body, lack of auto focus motor, a dated 10 megapixel resolution, and a list of missing features such as AEB (Auto Exposure Bracketing). To me there is no logical reason Nikon would make a new camera model so incredibly dated. If you are looking for a beginner camera I would suggest something with a metal rugged body that was made in the 1900's. If you are looking to dive into the wonderful world of digital SLR photography the D3000 is a limited let-down.This camera survives with a 3-star review because it's not an awful camera. The features the camera does have seem to work fairly well. But does this really matter considering the camera does almost nothing to honor the technological developments of the last 10 years? Would you be insulted if this camera lacked features found on  $200 point-and-shoots? Well I'm sad to say this, but even a \"lowly\" Canon SD 780 IS does quite a few things Nikon's D3000 doesn't. The white-balance presets found in the SD780IS seems to support a wider range of conditions than Nikon's giant mess. Add the video capabilities and the ability to compose shots on the LCD found in almost every point-and-shoot and you begin to wonder if Nikon is trying to pull a fast one on the DSLR industry.A brand new DSLR should have EVERYTHING lower point-and-shoot cameras have and more. They should not in any way be a testament to ancient cameras, intentionally limited in the way Nikon has limited the D3000. The D3000 was crippled by design, on paper, so it really surprises me Nikon would allow such a camera to exist. The statement Nikon is making with this camera is \"we do not keep up with modern technology\".As you probably know this camera does not support auto focusing on older Nikon lenses, although they will fit. There is no video capability. You cannot compose shots on the LCD. HDR enthusiasts will be annoyed by the lack of AEB.

Never really exceeding ISO 1600, except with the high 1 gimmick mode. Even the D70/s and D50 had ISO 1600, and at least those had buttons to change settings, unlike ANY of Nikon's entry level models. The D70/s and D50 also had in-body focus motors. That's gone with these stupid cameras too. I'm amazed they were generous enough to include more than 3 focus points in the D3000 though.

This is the most piece of crap camera for your money that you can buy.  It shoots terrible at high ISOs, terrible enough that the grain from the pictures can't even be corrected with Photoshop.  If you plan on shooting indoors in normal or ambient lighting conditions, don't buy this camera. It's ridiculous how frustrating the controls on this camera are.  On mine, say I want to change from A (aperture) mode to something else, like M (manual). In order to display the settings I can change with the thumb wheel, I have to completely shut the camera off and turn it on again in order for the display to change between modes. Nothing shows up in the viewfinder either, for when I want to quickly change minor settings while shooting.  Oh, and good luck if you ever want to remove the lens or switch them out.  Takes me a good 20 minutes to line up each lens perfectly and get them back onto the camera. I hate this camera and it's probably one of the most disappointing things I have every purchased.", "Date": "July 28, 2010"}, {"Title": "This Camera is horrible!", "Author": "K.
