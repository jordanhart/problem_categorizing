{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Upload over WiFi dysfunctional", "Author": "Valdemar Petersen", "ReviewID": "R3P1SI6GSZW6OX", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "One of the most interesting features of this camera would have been a direct upload of photos via WI-FI to Picasa or other services. Unfortunately, you can effectively do it only one picture at the time. As soon as the screen goes off to standby, it loses the WiFi connection and the uploads stop.So, if you are buying this camera for that feature - then don't. It is much faster to pull out the memory card, plug it into your computer and upload the photos then re-establishing WI-FI connection after every uploaded photo. There are really no other advantages of this camera. The fact that it has Android system doesn't add much to the overall functionality.In addition to that - the battery time is pathetic.****** UPDATE after 2 months of useBy now other reviewers described all the issues with this camera. After 2 months of use, I can confirm that the camera is just not ready for prime-time. In fact, after working with camera for a while, taking it on couple of holiday trips, I am considering ditching it and getting a different model. Things that I have issues with (some more, some less important)* Wi-Fi continues to be dysfunctional. In addition to losing connection when in standby mode, the reception is just pathetic. You need to be in the same room as the hot-spot. Forget about uploading photos as the end of the day on hotel (for example) Wi-Fi network. The whole experience is so frustrating and takes such a long time, that having extra memory cards and uploading photos later with PC is so much quicker and easier.* Battery time is quite bad. Battery won't take you through the day, which is really a shame when you are traveling and you want snap pictures. And, I was very careful, all the connectivity was off, wasn't keeping the screen on, etc* Boot time is just plain annoying. The camera turns on and you can snap a photo, but if you want to use other functions, you will have to wait a bit. Not a deal breaker, but just a bit annoying.* Charger plug; in the era of standardizing charger plugs to micro-b USB standard, it is just plain annoying that this camera has its own version of the plug so you need to carry an extra cable, as you cannot use the same USB cable of your android phone.* You cannot charge the camera and do anything else at the same time.* Yes, you can install apps to edit and manipulate photos. But, it is likely that you won't do this while outside shooting pictures as you will want to save the battery and you won't be able to do it at the end of the day as your battery will be dead and you won't be able to do it while charging the camera.So, if you are traveling and taking pictures, forget about coming back home (hotel) at the end of the day and simply uploading the photos.You will likely have to recharge your camera first (as you've probably used up the battery), then turn off the sleep mode so that you can upload multiple photos instead one photo at the time and reconnecting wi-fi after every upload(if you have good wi-fi reception at all) and then you will have to recharge the camera again to have it ready for the next day photo session.", "Date": "October 17, 2012"}, {"Title": "Freakin' Awesomesauce!!!", "Author": "Jason S. Paek", "ReviewID": "RYCZ3AE93LZJI", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "With the only review available, it was a little bit tough in making a decision buying the s800c, with it being the first phone with an Android operating system inside.  Even though it is only running android version 2.3 (Gingerbread), it's smooth as hell, and sometimes you will forget that this was originally a camera.  I caught myself treating it like my Samsung Epic Touch 4G, and with that note, taking pictures is so easy and once you take a picture, you can run any photo editing app (Instagram for one), and do whatever you gotta do right there on the spot.  Why didn't they think of this sooner???  I think that cameras are deserving of an operating system, and in this case, the s800c runnign Android is a match made in Heaven!Now that I have the camera, I do not know why the above reviewer got a 'grey market' item. Crutchfield.com makes a big fuss about how they DO NOT sell grey/gray market items, and this Nikon was up for sale on their site.  So I took the plunge here on Amazon, and could not been happier.  I was researching cameras for about a year before actually buying one, and the timing couldn't have been more perfect.  I heard that the Galaxy Camera will come out soon, but I believe that it will be tied to a carrier.In any case, as long as you are not an elitist photographer, this sexy little beast (mines white) will satisfy.  Picture quality is good and especially in low light conditions.  Lot's of fun modes, but now this is moot because now you have access to the Google Play store, in which a lot of photo editing apps are available.  I really recommend Picsay Pro though.  It reminds me more of photoshop than the actual photoshop app does lol!October1 16, 2012 - I can't leave this cammera alone!!!

We were super excited about having maps on the camera instead of having to carry around the paper map. We also wanted to be able to do email while gone without bringing a ton of devices that we would have to keep track of. I added the places we wanted to go to my google places before we left, which you can layer over the maps. Unfortunately, you need wifi to pull those up. You can view the maps offline, but you have to be zoomed in on where you are going before you leave wifi if you want it to be at the level you need to not get lost. Even though it has a few drawbacks, overall, it is a very nifty little camera.Pros:- Even though the mobile upload is slow, it works, which was nice when abroad since we only had 1 device.- Amazing picture clarity even when moving the camera. The clarity when zooming is better than most as well. As a camera it is better than most.- Touch capture is awesome (focuses where you touch instead of having to hold down the button which always makes me move the camera like crazy)- Nice to have one device instead of two, especially when traveling internationally where my phone won't work for calls anywayCons:- Battery life drains fast when using wifi- You can't use the camera while it charges. I found this extremely annoying. We would come back from a day out and want to plug the camera in to charge while using the internet, but you can't use it while it is charging. I've never had a phone/computer/tablet that you couldn't use while charging so I'm not sure why this one won't, but it is extremely annoying. This is the biggest drawback by far. I hope it can be fixed with a software update.", "Date": "October 26, 2012"}, {"Title": "A little frustrating", "Author": "David Bowers", "ReviewID": "R2BSY6TU88FDUS", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "Just got the camera yesterday so this review is based on very limited experience (about 2 hours of playing).  I'm not super tech savy but generally don't have problems with my iPad, Blackberry, and thinkpad.  Overall, the camera has a lot of potential, but there are so many frustrations/limitations that I'm not sure how much I will use it:Pro:*Beautiful screen*Android operating system (which is fairly easy to use)*low light pictures and zoom stabilization looked good on first few attempts*potential to quickly email/upload pictures without cables, laptops, etcCons:*Wifi is temperamental.  Couldn't figure out why Wifi kept dropping, but just read a review that said that Wifi drops when the camera goes to standby.  That would explain it!  Also, I couldn't get the Wifi to connect at all today (~5 attempts and turned camera on and off twice) until I took the battery out, pressed the start button a few times, then replaced the battery and booted back up.*Short battery life - already described in other reviews*Uploading pictures: Downloaded snapfish app, but couldn't get the app to work at all after multiple attempts.  App said it was uploading the picture but never finished (even after waiting for > 5 minutes).  Picasa app puts me in a loop I can't get out of (Sign in/You are already logged in/Please sign in).  Google Plus seems to work but I'm not a google person so I don't particularly want to set-up all the contacts, \"circles\", etc.*Can't use camera while charging.  When combined with the short battery life, this is REALLY irritating.Unfortunately I have a feeling that this camera is so much more difficult to use than my wife's iphone that it will end up being recycled without a huge amount of use.  (glad it was a \"reward\" from my company and not something I spent a bunch of money on)  Also guessing that Nikon or someone else will fix all of the problems eventually and this version will just be a painful memory.Unless you are very device savvy or super patient, be prepared for some frustration!", "Date": "November 7, 2012"}, {"Title": "BE CAREFUL -Screen Scratches VERY Easily!", "Author": "Karen Squires \"boocakes\"", "ReviewID": "R3TGXY3E1VQKUF", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "UPDATE: Apparently a review can't be left without people complaining that they don't agree and want me to change it. I will upgrade it to three stars, but will again say that the touch screen is pathetic. If anybody wants me to change it again to more stars, too bad:) Merry Christmas!I gave this review one star to grab attention so others don't have the same frustration I am having right now.I bought this adorable camera less than 24 hours ago. The LCD screen is scratched already! I am a professional photographer that wanted a little point and shoot to grab snapshots here and there. I also own the Nikon D700 and a few other Nikon bodies and lenses. I love Nikon, (not too thrilled with them right now) and have always recommended them to people who asked me about what brand they should buy. I treat my cameras with great care! My camera's, iPods and iPads all have screens in perfect condition. I do not have callused hands or any other problem that would have cause the LCD on this camera to scratch so quickly.I bought the camera yesterday, took it out of the box, charged it,..... while handling it with kid gloves, set it up via the touch screen, took a few photographs, put it away. This morning I get it out to play with it a bit. I notice what looks like messed up pixels on the screen. I back out of camera mode to see if it's a lens or sensor thing but it's still there. I open up a browser, still there. I get up and go to a window to see it better...SCRATCHES ALL OVER THE SCREEN....!!!! Most of them were on the right as I'm right handed. I get my lens cloth and gently rub them. No good. They're there to stay!I am so disappointed! My brand new toy that I had thought about for weeks before buying, is messed up already! And that's with me being very careful! I had ordered a screen protector within an hour of coming home too! It never occurred to me that I'd better not even lay one single finger on it in the meantime. Can you imagine what it will look like a week, a month, a year??Of course it's Sunday so I am stuck wondering if the local store I bought it from will exchange it for another one or if I'm stuck with this junky screen.Nikon, shame on you for putting such a piece of garbage screen on your camera! You must have noticed it getting scratched in the lab and in beta!Other than that, this camera is a gem! I completely love it and hope to get an exchange. I won't even take it out of the box till the screen protector is on hand and ready to install though.Update: I took it back to the store and they exchanged it for another one. I took it right to the mall and had a Zagg shield put on it. Now I'm happy as punch!If you shoot at ISO 125 you can get amazingly clean files that are close to some pro cameras!

You can download some really awesome Android apps and make some high quality images - much better than cell phones.

It's good, but I'll wait till generation 2 or generation 3 or generation 4 before I re-invest in this technology.

It has two major issues, same as the first one I purchased, which are:Wifi functionality: The wifi just doesn't work half the time on this thing. It will say I'm out of range from my home network when I'm in the room with my router and the wifi will just randomly shut itself off. The only way to get it to reconnect is to restart the camera, even then it won't resume connection after being woken out of standby.SD card functionality: The camera randomly tells me the SD card is \"Unable to be used\" in camera mode or \"Contains nothing or is not formatted\" in Android mode. I've tried two cards, a Sandisk and a Samsung that work fine in both my other cameras. Even after formatting the card, the camera will still randomly reject it.I really wanted this thing to work.

I say different. Yes, this camera isn't perfect, but its not miserable either. Since this camera came out, Nikon has released 3 firmware updates. They address the crashing, the wifi issues, and the uploading problems this camera has. I've been able to use this camera for up to 4 hours continuous use, and its on standby the entire day, when its the only thing available to check feeds and email. I've been able to watch HD youtube videos without hiccups, play fruit ninja and temple run, and use facebook, feedly, and all those other sites at ease. I just feel that the navigation buttons might be a bit cheap because they're starting to feel a bit loose. So I installed swipepad, and all my problems are over. Only one other problem.

Note I have the latest Firmware - and note the Nikon site doesn't make it all that easy to find it.Major Cons:1: For some reason sometimes when you use it the camera won't focus. This problem will not stop until you turn off the camera.  Frequently though, the camera refuses to turn off, and just goes to standby mode - so you have to pull out the battery.2: The built in photo service - it isn't really an app - occasional crashes.  You will be at some event take a photo, and notice, the shutter lag is unusually long, like a quarter second, then half second then crash.  As above it will instantly crash from then on until you turn off the camera - of course as I stated above the camera doesn't always turn off.3: The camera won't turn off.  You are suppose to press the button extra long to get it to shut down.  It will blink for about 30 seconds and then shut off - but more often then not, it won't and will just keep blinking forever - until you take the battery out.4: I don't deal with this, but I have read on other sites that if you want to download an app that will take photos, you won't be able to get the higher resolutions the camera can provide - those are only available to the proprietary camera photo program from Nikon.  Also for similar reasons you won't be able to root this camera to put on something better.Minor cons:1: Unlike the cell phone you can't charge and keep the camera on at the same time. Which would be nice if you are doing editing on the phone, or trying to transfer photos and don't want the battery to instantly discharge. Though it should be possible - no letting the kiddies play angry birds on this - you'll destroy the battery in no time.2: Battery life is not that long.3: The charger isn't the standard micro usb charger used by every other device, so you have to lug along a separate charger/charger cable.4:  It would be nice if they provided an app, and software that would allow wireless downloads to my computer - yeah, if I want to post all my pictures on facebook it works, but for now, you just got to take out the chip and plug it in the computer if you want to download - maybe someone can point out something for me here. This capability might exist, but Nikon has sure kept this secret if it does. (Edit: I think the idea is to use Dropbox,or Google Drive to get the pics to your PC - extra bonus this lets the NSA see them as well!)Pros:The camera itself looks pretty sleek.The screen on back is very nice,you can take photos by pressing the screen, just like a tablet,When it decides to focus, and the photo app doesn't crash the photos are really impressive.In summary, I think this could be a great camera - but Nikon seems to have released it too early - it isn't ready for prime.  They also need to think that it is part camera and part tablet, rather than a camera with Android as a marketing gimmick.  Note they also use Android Gingerbread - a really old buggy version of Android rather than the sleeker Jelly Bean,  that was also a mistake.", "Date": "May 17, 2013"}, {"Title": "Perfect Camera for my needs!", "Author": "Sonya Breaum", "ReviewID": "R12JNMM3FMQUR6", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Love this camera!

In one such as this, it should've been customized keeping in mind the limitations of the hardware (especially the battery), the size of the screen, and the purpose of the device. That's what Kindle Fire does, as does other devices. Nothing of the sort here. It's just an older version of android. A customized OS could use much less power, adopt a look more suitable for the device, and host only the programs relevant to the device.Hardware fault or software fault, it takes a considerable amount of time to start up to where you can use all its features. It takes half a minute to shut down. Everything seems slower than it should be on a device $150 cheaper than this. The fumbling you need to do to get to settings and features are simply unnecessary.

I get it that it takes 15 secs or so on power on (boot Android, rather) to take a pic with all the various processing/editing settings (at least you can take a basic pic immediately). I even get that the Wi-Fi needs to turn off while on the go to save battery.But what I *DON'T* get is why the camera's Android CANNOT be fully running while connected to a charger!?? Correct. Unlike every Android cell phone this past decade, this camera prompts you to basically shut down the phone before charging will work.The big sell point of this to me was indeed the ability to use any of many good Android apps to upload new pics either to my home storage and/or up into cloud storage. Indeed I don't want active Wi-Fi trying to upload while out and about to save battery. But when I come home or to the hotel after traveling, I expect this camera's Android to stay happily running overnight as my pics upload, etc. Or maybe I'm low on charge and simply want to view the day's pics ... No sir. Must power off camera and wait a few hours before viewing.At least Android gives you nearly a full computer to do LOTS & LOTS of cool things to the pics immediately after the shot (5 stars!). But no power on while charging is the real killer (-1 star). A close 2nd is the proprietary USB cable's connector (-1 star) ... that you will have to bring alongside your std. cell micro USB cable/charger.

I have a iPhone so I don't generally like android systems but the product was nearly 50% off and i had to have it! WiFi is cool on a camera but walk into best buy (where i got my new camera)and every point and shoot camera have it as well. besides that, its super slow and always cut off in the middle of doing something.So recently my mom got married, I spent the whole day with her and family and friends. I had been using the camera all day from 12pm to 10:30pm that same night. I charged it twice, because battery life sucks and you only get 140 pictures before you have to charge it again. Anyways I took close to 400 pictures from the day at the beach and her actual wedding. I was so happy! until I got home and went to look at my pictures I had taken from the day and all were gone except for 27 randomly selected pictures. What the Efff?! So I took the SD card out and put it in my moms camera (that she wasn't using) and the same randomly selected 27 pictures were still there. After screaming at my Nikon cool-pix s800c I put the SD card back in, this time I had no pictures and everything was completely gone! Yeah I was pissed! It told my my SD card was unreadable or it wasn't formatted and wouldn't let me take any pictures!So spending the whole rest of the weekend on the phone with Nikon and a photo recovering website (which told me the camera completely shot both of my SD cards) I finally took it to best buy and exchanged it for a better camera. I was so upset because the picture quality was amazing! I took pictures of everything from food, to the sky, my dog, and my boyfriend. I always had it with me and this was the first problem I had with it, but 400 pictures being gone and lost without being able to retrieve them, and from my moms wedding I was fed up and I'm totally boycotting the company!

This means I can only take this product to the reseller or importer for any warranty repair issues.  I highly doubt this will be an easy task to find someone to honor this warranty should I need it in the future.  I'm going to contact Amazon for a refund.  Here is what is on the Nikon Website at [...]What is \"Gray Market\" ?Generally, a manufacturer works with a single importer who can sell and support their products in a given region. The importer usually has local dealers and distributors who resell the imported products; this is called a \"distribution channel\". Gray Market refers to merchandise that is imported and sold by methods other than these normal channels.For local safety regulations and certifications (FCC, CE, UL, etc.) and government requirements a manufacturer provides special packaging (manuals in the appropriate language, power cables designed for the local receptacle, etc.) and product engineering designed to meet local codes. Manufacturers also have service and support agreements with the authorized importer.Gray Market items are not designed to be sold in a particular market and cannot be supported by the authorized importer because they may not meet mandatory safety and certification codes. Because these items are not designed for a particular market they may not function properly, or the authorized importer may not be equipped to provide service, support or software.With the opening of international borders and the use of the Internet to sell goods, Gray Market equipment has become extremely common in the photographic and consumer electronics markets. Many different types of equipment are brought into North America for sale without the proper documentation and US consumers do not always know what they are purchasing.Because the resellers' cost is less they can sell Gray Market items for less. Unfortunately this price savings is only on the initial purchase; because service and support is more difficult to obtain it may end up costing the consumer more in the long run.Who is the authorized importer of Nikon Equipment into the USA ?Nikon Incorporated USA is the sole authorized importer of Nikon Corporation of Japan for photographic devices. Nikon Inc. USA pays shipping into the USA, import duties and taxes, and provides service, support and downloads for these products. Nikon Inc. USA ensures that the products they import are fully certified and safe for use in the USA market.Nikon Inc. USA cannot provide service, support or downloads for products that have not been imported by Nikon Inc. USA.How do I know if my Nikon product is \"Grey Market\"?If the deal was just too good to be true, it probably was. One of the first indicators that a piece of Nikon merchandise might be Gray Market is if the price is considerably less than most other resellers.Additionally, a genuine Nikon Inc. USA product will include an Owners' Manual and Warranty Registration card in English. It will also include power cables (if applicable) designed for US style plugs. Any other language on the printed material or wrong cables indicates a Gray Market item.Another indication of a Gray Market product would be photocopied manuals or manually created software CD's. Nikon Inc. USA always provides professionally printed or duplicated materials with genuine products.What does owning a \"Grey Market\" Nikon product mean to you?Nikon Inc.
