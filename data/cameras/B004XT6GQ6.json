Howerton", "ReviewID": "RDXQX8SQOKWDA", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "My security package arrived in two days just as advertised by amazon Prime; however, the motion sensor lens was cracked and there was a crack in the plastic of one of the antennas.  The unit was simple to set up and worked as advertised in the daytime, but nighttime clarity suffered from security lights positioned around the parking area where I needed to monitor my car.  I returned the product due to the damage and inability of the unit to work as I had hoped at night.", "Date": "November 12, 2013"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": "$299.99", "Features": "Do-it-yourself, easy to setup and use\nWireless transmission up to 130ft with walls in between\nDigital signal, worry free of interception  by neighbor with wireless devices\nRecords video clips or photos to a SD card (up to 32GB) with time stamp\nApproximately 62 hours of video or 1157 million photos on a 32GB SD card (not included)", "Name": "Securityman Digital Outdoor Wireless Camera System Kit with PIR Motion, 2-Way Audio, Night Vision and SD Digital Video Recorder (DigiAir-SD)", "ImgURL": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41in8Y2SoLL._SY300_.jpg", "ProductID": "B004XT6GQ6"}}
