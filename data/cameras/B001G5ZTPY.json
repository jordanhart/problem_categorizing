{"Reviews": [{"Title": "A great in-between camera", "Author": "Lauren Holmes", "ReviewID": "REMDDG91OQQQZ", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I'm a hobbyist who long ago owned a Konica SLR and shot lots of slides.  In the digital age, I've only owned point-and-shoot cameras and have become frustrated by their lack of flexibility and quality.  I looked long and hard at SLRs but don't yet feel I can spring for the price.  I also wanted something more easily portable.  But I wanted complete control over shutter speed and aperture, and I wanted to be able to shoot in RAW for more post-processing flexibility.  I decided to spring for the G10.Since purchasing  this camera about a week ago, I've taken about 2,000 shots. (I went a little nuts!)  Here's what I've learned so far:-- Although the auto settings produced very good pictures, this camera really comes into its own when you shoot in Manual mode.  I was able to routinely get some vivid fall sunset scenes on a lake with beautifully saturated color and contrast by tweaking shutter speed and aperture settings separately.-- I'd say that the noise at 400+ without post-tweaking is considerable, though nowhere near what I used to see on 400 ISO film back in the day.  It was easily reduced post-processing using a noise-reduction program that works within Photoshop, and I ended up with some beautiful indoor shots with minimal effort.  I even took some night landscape pictures with a bright moon at 1600, and was pleasantly surprised at the results after tweaking them afterward.-- I was able to get extremely sharp photos in macro mode (closeups of bees in flowers, that kind of thing), again without a tripod.  I'm still getting the hang of focusing on the exact part of the flower that I want; I find it more cumbersome to do it with this camera than I did with my old SLR (where you just turned the lens with your hand).-- The camera did a good job out of the box at face recognition.  The built-in flash on auto settings was just OK; it didn't hideously over-expose the faces, but it didn't look entirely natural either.  Again, moving away from the auto settings and using fill flash judiciously helped me create some much more natural and attractive portraits. I would imagine adding a separate flash attachment would help even more.  I found my favorite portraits were taken with no flash at all and some light tweaking with contrast in Photoshop.-- The optical zoom met my needs well.  I loved having the wide-angle capability for landscape shots, and I got some gorgeous, very clear pictures of a bald eagle at the top of a tree with the telephoto zoom.  The camera clearly showed me when I was moving beyond the optical zoom into digital zoom, and my pictures of the eagle deteriorated accordingly.  I will probably turn off the digital zoom.-- The camera comes with all kinds of built-in scene settings (snow, night snapshots, sunsets, underwater, etc.), most of which I haven't yet found that helpful.  I did get a couple of fun foliage shots using the sunset and foliage settings, but in both cases I could've gotten the same results simply tweaking in Photoshop afterward.  If you don't want to mess with post-processing programs or playing with the camera's controls, I could see how these scene settings could be useful.-- Photoshop CS3 can't open the RAW files from this camera yet.  This is a big drawback for my purposes.  I have opened the RAW files in the Canon software that comes with the camera, but it's not nearly as powerful or intuitive as Photoshop.  So for now, I'm exporting the RAW files to Photoshop as TIFFs, and they're enormous -- 85 MG.  The quality is marvelous, however, and I'm hoping that Adobe will quickly add support for the G10.I'll try to add some photo examples to this review.  I noticed they get a little washed out when saved for the web; the originals are much more vivid.As point-and-shoots go, this is about as good as it gets for my purposes.  I gave it five stars, though I'd like to give it a half-star demerit for the lack of RAW support in Photoshop (a problem I hope will soon be corrected).  If you're not quite ready for the leap to an SLR but you want more control and quality than the common point-and-shoot camera, this is an outstanding choice.", "Date": "October 14, 2008"}, {"Title": "Don't be afraid... buy this camera!", "Author": "William E. Irving", "ReviewID": "R1QPLYGDFZPZ8D", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I am what one may call a \"serious amateur\" photographer. My first serious camera was a WWII-vintage 35mm Leica rangefinder that my dad, while in the U.S. Army, got from a captured German Oberleutnant (he said he won it from him playing cards!). I still have that camera, though it needs work. My first \"modern\" SLR was a Canon F-1 I got back in the early 1980's. Wife Number One got that - along with all the lenses and accessories - in the divorce. <Sniff!> <Sob!>At this stage in my life, I still care about the quality of pictures I take, but I no longer have the money or the desire to carry around a bulky DSLR body with a satchel full of lenses, flashes, filters, etc. Forgive me, O gods that guard the purity of the photographic arts - I want a point-and-shoot! But I don't want a toy, either.My first choices would have been something like a Leica DLUX 4 10.1-megapixel Digital Still Camera or a maybe a Sigma DP1 14MP Digital Camera. Both - sorry to say - are a little too rich for my blood right now. That left me with plan B - either the Panasonic DMC-LX3K 10.1MP Digital Camera with 2.5x Wide Angle MEGA Optical Image Stabilized Zoom (Black) or the Canon Powershot G10 14.7MP Digital Camera with 5x Wide Angle Optical Image Stabilized Zoom.As much as I have liked Canon products in the past (I have owned Canon scanners and printers as well as cameras over the years and have always liked their products), I was highly suspicious of the Canon G10 on the grounds of its 14.7 Megapixel resolution. How much digital noise would I have to endure so Canon could claim victory in the latest skirmish of the megapixel wars? I was also very intrigued by the Panasonic for its lens - extremely fast for a point-and-shoot at f2.0 and its unusually wide angle of 24mm (35mm equivalent).In the end I got the Canon G10 for the following reasons:1. Most of my shooting is either portrait or outdoor scenery shots, where short to long telephoto (60mm-200mm equivalent) is most appropriate, so the extreme wide angle of the Panasonic was less useful to me. If you are someone who takes lots of family group shots in close quarters, you may feel differently, however.2. The Canon, though with a slower lens than the Panasonic, was nevertheless able to pass my \"art museum test.\" In other words, I could take excellent hand-held shots indoors of art objects in available light at fairly low ISOs of well under 400, sometimes at nearly 200; shots clear enough to show the depth and detail of every brush stroke. I found that to be good enough for me. But if you are someone who likes to do available-light shots in candle light or outdoors around camp fires, the extra speed of the Panasonic's lens may then become crucial.3. The Panasonic, though admittedly an excellent camera of its type, was awkward to use, at least for me. It was a tad too small for comfort (I am a big guy, 6'4\", 280 pounds, with hands like catcher's mitts). The camera always felt on the verge of slipping out of my hands, especially when holding it in my left hand while messing with the controls with my right. And mess around I did, since the controls were not particularly intuitive in their operation. I'm sure one could get used to just about anything, especially if one reads the manual and practices with it long enough. But I am of the school that believes that good interface design means NOT having to read the manual!4. The Canon G10, in my opinion, just fits. Big enough and properly shaped for my hands to feel comfortable gripping, but just small enough for carrying in a coat or jacket pocket (though admittedly too big and heavy for a shirt pocket). What's more, every major control is plainly marked and positioned right where God intended for it to be. I found that the Canon passed my \"users manual test\" as well. Only with the most obscure and least-often-used functions did I have to break out the damned book to figure out how they worked. The camera feels satisfyingly solid, with very good build quality; it just feels good in the hands. I found I felt comfortable with the camera very quickly, could take pictures right away, without hassling with learning the manufacturer's perverse sense of control interface logic.5. I found the image quality to be generally excellent, with great detail present and surprisingly low noise at ISOs below 400. Left to the camera's automatic white balance sensors, I found the color balance just a tad bit cool for my taste, but what do I know... I'm an old Kodachrome guy. In any case, it is easy to set your own custom settings for color temperature to suit your preference. Even if forced to take shots at ISO 400 and above, all is not lost. For Photoshop users, I recommend PictureCode's Noise Ninja ([...]) plug-in. For users of The GIMP (excellent open source free photoshop alternative), try GREYCstoration ([...] Both of these software plug-ins do an excellent job of cleaning up noise without obvious objectionable artifacts. These tools enable shots at high ISO to be much more usable, unless you insist on those poster-sized blow-ups.In sum, the Canon's worst shortcoming, noise at high ISO (a problem with ANY digital point-and-shoot that sells for less than a grand), is more than outweighed by its sheer usability, its excellent feel, solid build quality and intuitive interface, as well as image quality good enough to satisfy just about anybody. I will step out here and say that on prints 11x13 and smaller, it would take a keen eye indeed to tell the difference between most images from a G10 and those from a DSLR selling for more than twice the price.What's more, the Canon G10 offers, for those who want to explore the deeper capabilities of the camera, a wide array of automatic shooting modes as well as excellent creative control options, including RAW image support (although Canon's implementation is STILL proprietary and not yet natively supported in Photoshop), shutter or aperture priority, full manual exposure mode, and precise control not only of depth of field, but independent focus and exposure locks, too. This is an easy camera for a novice to just pick up and use, but is sufficiently advanced for the serious amateur or pro when he or she needs high quality with low bulk, and for that novice who wants to grow into his or her new hobby.For a novice, this camera may seem a touch pricey, but at less than $500 is truly a steal compared to the prices of other high-end point-and-shoots to which the Canon G series is often compared.", "Date": "November 1, 2008"}, {"Title": "The Shooter's Point and Shoot", "Author": "E. F. Paredes \"chai and a book\"", "ReviewID": "RY3AU5TKEFL8", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "If you're in the market for a general purpose advanced point and shoot digital camera, try this one for size.- The controls are nicely laid out - all the things you need to compose your shot (exposure settings, macro/normal button, flash on/off etc) are all readily accessible on the right side of the camera body- It's lightweight yet feels sturdy- It lends itself well to accessories such as teleconverters, external flash units, and even a waterproof shell- The LCD screen is huge and bright and contains plenty of useful information like (for example) a live histogram, exposure settings, gridlines to help you shoot straight, and even an exposure meter when shooting fully manual- At 28mm wide you can get a big group of people into the shot quite easily- There's plenty of shooting options that will cover most needsI gave the G10 4 stars because I'm being nitpicky:- When shooting through the viewfinder, there is no info at all about your exposure setting, number of shots, battery life, etc.  Nothing.  Just the view.  (I do like how the image magnifies accordingly when you zoom)- The aperture opens up only to 2.8 and closes down only to 8.0, when shooting full manual mode.- And sadly yes, there is a fair amount of pixel noise when shooting in low light without either a flash or tripod.  This could be a problem for those of us who have been scolded for popping off flashes where we shouldn't.I did not expect this camera to rise to the level of a high quality film SLR or DSLR.  When I bought it I was in the market for a good street photography camera - something light and surreptitious enough to photograph unique things I would come across in my daily romps in the city.  Something that I could tweak a bit instead of relying on the camera's preset exposures.For that use the Powershot G10 suits me just fine - even exceeding my expectations at certain levels.  It's worth a try.", "Date": "October 9, 2008"}, {"Title": "The happy medium between dSLR's and point and shoot cameras", "Author": "Nick \"whereishawkins\"", "ReviewID": "R1FGEC630VFIDF", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "It's important to understand this camera within context: This isn't a digital SLR replacement or a pocket d-SLR. This is an excellent camera for someone who is a dSLR shooter as a backup, or even someone wanting to graduate from a point and shoot to allow them more control over the camera.The Powershot G10 incorporates a few new features over it's predecessor, the G9. It loses it's 6x optical zoom down to 5x optical zoom, but packs 14.7 megapixels, features a wide-angle zoom compared to the G9, and uses Canon's new Digic IV processing engine.The Pros:* RAW capture. RAW photos don't feature any of the conversions that JPGs do, but also takes up a lot more space. Your typical RAW photo out of this camera will be 15MB, versus 4MB for a high quality JPG. It's nice having this flexibility.* Supports Canon's Speedlite external flash units.* Manual controls over aperture and shutter speed for additional controls. This is the single biggest advantage to the G10: if you have a SLR of any type, you're used to changing f-stops, shutter speed and other things on the fly to take better and more creative photos.* Shoots VGA video. I would have like to have seen 720p video myself.The cons:* Expensive spare batteries. $70? Seriously, that's insane.* Early adopters will find out that Adobe products (Lightroom, Photoshop) and Apple Aperture won't support the G10's RAW - yet. *fingers crossed* You can use the included Canon software, which I find unweildy and a pain to deal with.I do recommend picking up a 4gb SDHC card, such as a Kingston or Sandisk. Class 6 cards are recommended to handle those large files that you'll be shooting. Also, this won't fit in most camera pouches (I couldn't get it to fit in any of the Lowepro pouches without me feeling like I'm smushing it in there) so you're better off going to a camera store and trying them out.In the few days that I've had this camera, I feel happy for having it, and it definitely feels like a more \"adult\" camera than my previous Powershots (not to say that they weren't any good, it's just that I've gotten to the point as a photographer where I *need* the flexibility that this camera can provide.) If you're looking at making the jump to something more advanced, then give this camera a try.

I bought it two weeks ago based on Michael Reichman's (luminouslandscape website) and Thom Hogan's (bythom[...]) reviews.  I am an advanced amateur/prosumer -- I sell fine art landscapes, and have been photographing for about 35 years.The G10 is heavy at about a pound, but I like the heft. It is quite compact (at least from my perspective) -- the lens fully retracts and it will fit in a large jacket pocket. I have a medium-large Zing pouch I put it in and carry in my backpack, or alternatively put the Zing pouch on my belt loop.I'm astonished at the image quality and functionality offered by the G10. I haven't shot any jpegs, only RAW (using DPP to process RAW; the RAW images will no doubt be more malleable with other software when they support the G10 -- DPP is fairly limited).  In RAW, at ISO 80 on a tripod, I think the detail rendered by the G10 exceeds or at least equals the Canon 5D. It may have a weaker or virtually no AA filter.The lens on the G10 is fantastic. There is very little resolution fall off, even wide open, edge to edge and into the corners.In my mind, the closest equivalent to the G10 is a Fuji 645 medium format rangefinder (remember the small zoom range Fuji 645 compact?), but the G10 is better in almost every way.  The G10 is far lighter and more compact, offers a great zoom range (and is sharp throughout the zoom range) and image stabilization, and has enough resolution to produce fine art quality prints, up to 18\" or 24\" in the long dimension without stitching.I think the G10 is opening up a whole new world of landscape, street photography possibilities, and what about the incredible macro versatility?There is a substantial drop off in image quality from ISO 200 to ISO 400 on the G10, but ISO 400 is still very very good (again shooting RAW), much better than the panasonic LX3 that I tried  for a week or two at ISO 400.I must be crazy. I can't believe a compact with such a small sensor can render detail this well. I'm seeing the G10 as a whole new tool that will open up different possibilities and different ways of seeing (and have different limitations than a Canon DSLR). I haven't been this excited about a photographic tool since I purchased my Canon 5D over 3 years ago.The Canon G10 offers \"automatic\" settings that I haven't tried.  For an advanced photographer it offers a wealth of manual controls and customization, which I'm still learning.  One very nice touch is that the custom settings on the top dial (there are two) allow you to save the zoom settings and manual focus setting -- so I have one saved at a 35mm focal length equivalent and another at a 50mm equivalent.  This allows quick, street shooting, similar to what one can do with a Leica rangefinder, though the G10 has a much different look given the virtually infinite depth of field due to the small sensor.", "Date": "November 18, 2008"}, {"Title": "A very pleasant surprise and upgrade from the G7", "Author": "Gordon", "ReviewID": "R3ZJWB36DD04Q", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "MY MOVE FROM THE G7 to the G10.I own and really like the Canon G7.  I passed on purchasing the G9, not seeing much that would attract me over the G7.  But as I read about the G10, I began to see enough new stuff to make it sound interesting to me. Little did I guess what a huge leap up this purchase was going to be.I'll try to focus here on items you may not have read about in the reviews below, or at least items that may not have been covered in any detail.Overall, the feel and build of the G10 is simply great.  Nothing about it feels flimsy or cheap to me.  It has a bigger grip on the right front where your fingers wrap around the camera and the camera is a delight to hold and use.The LCD is now 3\" of course, and much sharper and crisper than my G7. The G10 still uses my SD and SD HC (SD High Capacity) cards and I am happy about that.I wanted to test the new \"I-Contrast\" feature I had been hearing about, so I sat my wife in the bay window with a fully sunlit window behind her. I took a series of photographs from several feet away, focusing (with face detect) on her face.With the test shots where I had \"I-Contrast\" turned off, her face was visible but pretty dark as were the interior walls around the window behind her. Not an unusable picture, but certainly not a good picture either. I was surprised they were as good as they were but I still wanted better than this.So I enabled \"I-Contrast\" and shot the same scene.  The results were a very pleasant surprise.  The outside scene through the window was still slightly overblown ... almost exactly as in the first series.  But my wife's face and the interior walls were now much more properly exposed and the pictures were truly usable ... something most of us would be happy to have taken. It was clear that \"I-Contrast\" really does work and since it is easy (using the camera menu) to engage \"I-Contrast\" I will certainly be using that feature often in contrasty scenes where I want to avoid harsh black shadows.I was quite impressed with the quality of this new lens.  I thought I had a sharp crisp lens on my G7 but the lens on my G10 is a definite step up. Or maybe it is the additional pixels ... whatever, the difference is remarkable and was totally unexpected.I was a bit concerned about the loss of Optical zoom range from the zoom range available with my G7. I never used digital zoom on the G7 because it was too easy to lose picture quality and I didn't want to risk that. But I had read about a new feature of the G10 where it if you set the digital zoom to \"standard\", the camera would combine Optical and Digital zoom and allow you to seamlessly use them together up to a point just shy of where picture degradation would begin. Then it would stop zooming. If you then tried to zoom some more, the G10 will allow that but you will then be digital zooming into the range where there is a risk of picture degradation.  All very clever I thought, but did it actually work?I decided to test that.  I sat the camera on a block wall and shot the street sign across the intersection (about 150 feet).  As I expected, when I zoomed in the zoom ran seamlessly to what appeared to be maximum and stopped.  I took the picture.  Then I twisted the zoom button again and sure enough, the zoom continued zooming (into the possible degradation zone) to the true maximum zoom using not only all optical capability but ALL digital capability.I fired up my computer and loaded the first shot ... the \"standard\" zoom.  Taken at 14.7 Mega Pixels, I was immediately stunned by the quality of the shot. It wasn't just good, it was simply flawless!  There was absolutely nothing about that shot that I wanted to improve except, perhaps, it still didn't bring the street sign all that close. So, using my photo editor, I just kept zooming in on the street sign until it virtually filled my monitor ... and the image was STILL FLAWLESS! I simply couldn't believe my eyes. Color was perfect, edges of the lettering were crisp and absolutely sharp.  There was nothing for me to improve in a photo editor. I was stunned. (I may have even laughed out loud). Even the leaves of the mesquite tree in my neighbor's yard which is some 20 feet behind the sign were all visible and definable.  WOW! WOW! WOW!Then I loaded the next shot where I had zoomed the G10 out until it paused, then zoomed more to push the combination of Optical and Digital zoom to the absolute limit.  To keep it short:  It was about as good as I was used to getting from my G7 using Optical zoom only ... which is OK, but not truly sharp, crisp and the green color of the sign looked somewhat faded.  Also the tree leaves in the background were no longer distinct ... Again this is not a picture you'd throw away by any means and one which could be improved with some work in Photoshop but even with that effort, it would be nothing near the quality I could get with the G10s method of combining Optical and just the right amount of Digital zoom.  And the G10 gave it to me without any additional effort whatsoever.My future approach to photography of distant objects in the future  was immediately obvious.  I will use the G10's built in magic (as I did in the first zoom shot) and then simply crop and enlarge the crop to the size I want for flawless, effortless results.As I said, I skipped the G9 so I cannot compare the G9 and the G10, but I couldn't be happier with my decision to upgrade my G7 to the G10.  The G10 clearly takes this type of photography to a new level with features, a great lens and picture quality.For several years, I actually had a $6,500 setup including the Canon Mark II and some \"L\" glass lenses.  It was heavy, cumbersome and took pictures which, as expected, cried out for work in Photoshop. Professional cameras produce pictures that expect the photographer to work on them.  While I enjoyed fiddling with the pictures from the Mark II, I eventually tired of that weight, bulk and switching lenses so I gave the camera to my son. Now, that I have this G10, I will never look back.I guess I will need Photoshop again if I try to take pictures in the dark with the G10, it does have a bit more noise at higher ISOs. And if you are a true pro, you will probably rant and rave about noise at higher ISOs I suppose.For the rest of us, the pictures up to ISO 400 are quite acceptable and if are really picky, noise removal is simple enough to accomplish with Photoshop or any other software capable of noise reduction.  In real life, I guess I don't shoot much where I use ISOs beyond 400 anyway.I have owned cameras all my life and I have never owned a camera I liked more than this G10, or from which I got better pictures right out of the camera than this G10.

The JPEG files that cameras output, like my Canon SD800IS, look fine, however, because the camera has already processed its RAW info in making the JPEG, the options left for photo editing afterward are limited.The Canon G10 was my choice for moving to a more advanced camera with RAW file output, higher quality optics, and without the bulk of the Digital SLRs.

Well, that's just plain dumb.  If that's what you expect, think again.  If you want the highest possible image quality even at high ISOs, you should save up the $$$$ for that DSLR.  Or, better yet, learn photographic technique and processes and buy an 8x10 view camera with a heavy tripod and get the best in image quality.The G10 is what it is.  It is a well-built, versatile, small camera that is highly capable in highly capable hands and still very functional to those less capable.  It's a camera for the person who uses bigger cameras who doesn't always want or need to carry a bigger camera.  It produces satisfying results and it has a super good lens that covers the most useful focal length range (35mm equivalent 28mm to 135mm--I know, it says it goes to 140mm but 135mm is a traditional focal length and 5mm +/- doesn't matter at all when you get into the telephoto range).My background includes three plus decades in photography as a former professional to present enthusiast.  Taking up digital photography some time back, I discovered there's not much difference in the practice compared to using film.  Many people try to complicate things, but photography is still pretty basic.  You don't have to be a deep thinker, you just have to see things.  I like equipment that doesn't get in the way of seeing.  I've been using the G10 for the past week and I'm impressed with the results I've gotten.  I also like the way it handles.  For a number of years, I have used Canon EOS film cameras and more recently DSLRs.  The ergonomics and functions of the G10 seem fairly familiar to me.  I've also used Leica rangefinders when I wanted something smaller and quieter for candid photography on trips or when attending events.  The G10 fits nicely into this niche and for a heckuva lot less than a Leica M8 digital.I've shot 35mm Tri-X and HP5+ film pushed to high ISOs in order to accomplish pictures under low light without using flash.  I'm familiar with grain.  It's not my enemy.  It's not a bad thing.  It just \"is\".  So when people complain of noise at high ISOs with the G10, I have to respond, \"So what?\"  The important thing is not that there is grain or noise in the picture, it's whether or not the picture you took was worth taking.  Image quality is secondary under those circumstances.  The G10 pictures are perfectly fine under these circumstances.But if you have to ask about image quality at the lower ISOs, the G10 does a great job.  JPEGs straight from the camera are excellent.  There are two custom functions that can be set to your preferences.  I have one set for black and white and one set for super vivid color.  I also have been shooting in RAW and I've gotten good results here as well.  I'm still playing with RAW conversions from this camera.  The conversion process seems a little more cumbersome than how it is done with my Canon DSLR's software.  I'm still in the learning process in the regard.  I'm probably complicating a process that is really not that complicated.Who would benefit from using this camera?  Just about anyone from the vacation/family/holiday chronicler of events to the seasoned professional looking for a \"pro\"-grade point and shoot (a contradiction in terms, I agree).  It produces great results shooting in bright light at low ISOs and the results under low light at higher ISOs is only a cause for concern if your expectations are too high.UPDATE May 30, 2009:I've used this camera for six months now.  It has replaced my dSLR for most general shooting.  RAW works great and B&W; JPEGs rival results from film.  I'm still more interested in prints than in viewing photos on a monitor and tightly cropped 8.5x11 prints from the G10 really look good.  Sure, they will fall apart if you enlarged to billboard size but who really prints billboards?  B&W; photos at ISO 400 are not at all noisy compared to Tri-X's grain.  Outside in good light, using ISO 80, the quality is amazing, especially shooting RAW and processing the image yourself.  You can even get interesting grain-like effects using high ISOs and playing with exposure compensation.  It's a very versatile camera.The camera is now well used with a lot of scuffs on the LCD and a couple of scratches on the lens, but it continues to function perfectly. It was getting so much use, I decided to buy the Canon leather case to slow down the wear and tear.Yeah, the camera could be better.  A larger sensor would enhance high ISO image quality.  A faster lens would make life easier for those of us who hate electronic flash and refuse to carry tripods everywhere.  Both of these changes would result in a heavier, larger camera so maybe it's best to accept the G10 as it is.", "Date": "November 25, 2008"}, {"Title": "Excellent point and shoot", "Author": "George", "ReviewID": "R1OWQQWVYUHLYG", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Most of the criticisms in other reviews relate to high noise over ISO 200, and that is true.  But below 200 they are very good.  Luminous Landscape just posted a comparison of the $500 G10 against a $40,000 Hasselblad H2 with a 39 megapixel back and was amazed to find little observable difference in 13x19 prints.  8 professional photographers could not distinguish reliably between them.  That is a lot of performance for a camera the size of a cigarette pack and 1/80th the price of the other camera.I like the controls.  ISO and over/under compensation are dials on top of the camera.  No more hunting through the menu to make those adjustments.  Image stabilization makes it possible to shoot at relatively low shutter speeds.  RAW and full manual controls make this a very versatile and easy to use camera.I rarely shoot at ISO 400 or above so I don't think the noise at higher settings is a major flaw.  I previously used a Canon Proshot 1 that cost twice as much as the G10 and it only went up to ISO 400.  I suspect Canon included 800 and 1600 in case you had to use them but you will need them less because of image stabilization.Overall a great camera to take traveling.Update:I just returned from a two week trip.  Along with the G10, which weighs nothing and fits in a jacket pocket, I took a Canon 1Ds III with a full set of lenses in a pack that weighed about 30 pounds.  Hauling the 1Ds around cities was just too much of a hassle so the G10 was the camera that got used except in instances where the big camera was with me or it was worth going back to take a shot I couldn't get with the G10.  That gave me a good comparison between the best camera Canon makes and the G10.First, ignore all the people that found the camera's image quality inadeqate, especially the megapixel freaks.  I previously used a Canon Proshot 1 as a carry around camera.  It has 8 megapixels and an L quality lens that has about the same range as the G10.  The G10 produces a noticeably better image.  The color is dead on in multiple light conditions from bright sun to shadow to indoor under artifical light.  The quality is comparable to the 1Ds except when a wider lens was needed or light was very low.The image stabilization is a big advantage.  Shots are amazingly clear and sharp.  The camera can be reliably hand held down to 1/15 and lower if care is taken.  I took one shot of an alter illuminated with artifical lights inside a dark church.  The shutter speed was 1/5 but by steadying the camera on the back of a bench I got shots the 1Ds could not surpass on a tripod.  What really amazed me was that the color was right on shooting in program mode and making no color adjustments on my own.  I also noticed that one shot was at ISO 100 while another was ISO 400.  I printed both to compare.  The 400 shot has noticeable grain in the shadow areas but the illuminated portions of the alter are very close to 100.  The camera also has a lot of exposure range.  Rarely was a shot unusable because either the highlights or shadows were blown.The lens is excellent.  Very sharp and free of flare, even with the sun in the frame.  The self contained lens cover is also helpful.  The cap on the Proshot 1 was prone to falling off if it brushed against someone in a crowd leaving the lens exposed for the rest of a trip.  I also really liked having the exposure compensation and ISO dials on the top of the camera.  That made it much easier to adjust for shots when needed without having to stop and work in the camera's menu.In sum, this is a very good camera, especially for traveling.  It will not take very wide or long photos and shots are grainy at higher ISOs but cameras with fewer megapixels will not take better photos and the high ISOs combined with great IS and the ease of carrying it around makes it possible to get shots that would be impossible otherwise.The battery is also very good.  I ended up taking about 350 photos with the G10.  The battery indicator showed full charge the whole time.This camera has limits.  It was not built to be used for professional quality shots in a studio but it could probably be used for that purpose to an extent.  It has too much lag in setting up the shot to be used for sports or active children or pets.  It was never pitched as a camera that could do those things.  But it does take very good photos.  Better than any small camera I have ever used and equal to the best cameras in a broad range of conditions.2/28/09  Third installmentA mea culpa is in order plus a drop to 4 or even three stars.  The camera is inconsistent.  It remains great for traveling and shooting without a flash.  I keep the 5 stars for that.  But shooting indoors with flash is poor bordering on unuseable.  Shots of my grandson are full of grain and lack detail.  They remind me of shooting 400 asa print film with a mediocre point and shoot camera.  The camera is also slow to shoot and slower to recover and shoot again.  Shots under similar conditions with my 1Ds III are stunningly clear and I can shoot five or six shots quickly in succession.  With the G10, I get one shot and have to wait several seconds before I can take the next shot.  The G10 is simply not useable for indoor flash.It is strange that the camera can be so good in natural light without a flash and so bad with the flash.

My SLRs are Canon. I also shoot digital and film with Leicas. I bought the G10 in the hopes that Canon's use of the Digic IV processor would yield low noise images. I was wrong. The noise starts to ruin the photos at levels of ISO 200 and above. That's not acceptable in today's camera market. Unless you plan to shoot outdoors in bright conditions all the time, don't bother with this camera. The ergonomics are good and the build quality is top notch, but the imager is just not up to the job. Perhaps someday the megapixel race will end and manufacturers will go back to 6 or 7 megapixels with super-low noise at high ISO. They would do us all a favor if they moved in this direction. I did not own a G9 so I can't compare them.I returned the camera the same day it arrived after shooting test images in RAW format, giving the camera the best possible chance of pleasing.It is possible to have great image quality in a pocket camera. Just look at the Sigma DP-1.Since first writing this review, I did similar tests on the new Leica D-Lux4 (similar to the Panasonic LX3) and the performance of this camera was great up to and including ISO800.

I would have hoped Canon would keep the resolution (megapixels) low in order to decrease noise, and when I saw the 15MP resolution, I assumed the photos would be sub-par. Nevertheless, I needed a full-manual compact camera and took the plunge.I have to say that I was pleasantly surprised with the G10's performance. Indeed, the image quality is not the same as the shots from my 40D (digital SLR), but it is very good. The images are clear, sharp and vibrant. There is only minimal artifacting and noise at ISO 80 - 200. Unlike some of the other reviewers, I think ISO400 is fine for everyday shots. ISO800 is fairly noisy, and 1600 is a last resort setting. (But, make no mistake, the image quality at these settings is as good or better than all other compacts I've seen, including my Fuji F31fd, which is legendary for good low-light performance.)If you are looking for an advanced point-and-shoot camera, I believe you won't find a better one than the G10. There are a few very expensive ($1000+) rangefinder and APS sensor compacts, but I haven't tried them.One last thing to keep in mind when judging this camera. Because of the high resolution, the noise is going to be finer and more subtle when you look at an overall image. If you zoom in to 100% resolution on a 7MP photo, you are seeing twice the image area as when you zoom in to 100% on a 15MP photo. If you want to compare the G10's image quality to that of other cameras, make sure you zoom both images to the same size, and not just to 100%.

I want to tuck it in my purse or belt pack and keep it with me at all times, as I have with various P&S; digitals for over a decade. Anything more, I can haul out the 35mm Canon EOS system I used when shooting motorsports. (Alas, that spends most of the year in the very heavy camera bag loaded with all the stuff one tends to acquire with a SLR. Not convenient to haul around except for special occasions.)I bought my G10 three days after it was released and have taken several hundred shots with it since under many different conditions. It's a bit on the heavy side but the construction is very solid. The neck strap is a bit short for the way I prefer to carry my cameras (across my shoulder/chest) but that's easily fixed with an aftermarket strap. A Lowepro Edit 100 case works well and has space for my cell and ID so I'm not unduly encumbered when out hiking.Leave the camera set on \"Auto\" and you can shoot excellent photo after excellent photo (assuming you know the basics of composition and photography).

I thought, \"How much better can it be to own a model that's 7 more generations down the road?!\"  I purchased it in spite of the inordinate number of Amazon buyers who gave it 3-stars or below.  I thought it was probably user error or buyer's remorse.  After about 300 trial photos, alas, I have to be honest to both myself and you & join the 3-star raters.An awesomely built camera, the G10 will appeal to most of us who have been using high-end DSLR's and are looking for the flexiblity in features and the high portability of the G10...and to skilled prosumers who just really like the feel quality in their hands.I have to say, I love the controls, the feel of the camera, the flexibility to fine tune and experiment in lots of different lighting and contrast situations.  But the G10 is unforgiving in both the auto mode and the manual modes if you don't get it \"just right\".  Using it in auto mode, I rarely get a photo that is very satisfactory to my eye & taste.  They almost always have that soft, milky, overexposed look...kind of like taking a photo through atomospheric haze.Now some better news!  If you are like me and you like your photos sharp, well-saturated, with lots of contrast, there is a solution.  It's in the mode called \"My Colors\".  All you have to do is use the Program Mode, press the \"Func Section\" key in the middle of the control wheel,  curser down to \"Custom Color\" press the Disp. Button and  chose My Colors on the selector wheel.  Watch the choices at the bottom of the screen and you will find you can set the Sharpness, contrast, & color to your taste.  You can even tweak it to emphasize individual color like red, blue, & green while toning others down.  After cranking all of these settings to suit my taste and shooting in the Program Mode, I now find that my G10 is very close to what I was wanting in the first place.  I now get the sharpness, saturation, and contrast I love in my photos.I guess the bottom line is that the default settings on the G10 are very much set to record life as we see it; but most of us want our photos to make life \"pop\" a little more than what we see in real life.  In other words, we like life a little more vivid in photos than it really is.  That makes them more fun and more pleasing to look at.  Looking at most of my G10 photo's on the default settings reminds me of looking at the Grand Canyon through the haze of a distant forest fire.....beautiful but uninspiring and left wanting.For build and quality, I'll give my G10 a 5-star; for quality of photo in the default modes, I have to downgrade it to 3-stars.  I think the Canon image crafters blew it on this one.  There just shouldn't be that much distance between what you get at the the default settings of the camera and the distance you have to go with the manual tweaks to get great images.But I'm keeping it.

By \"its type,\" I mean a high-quality, traditional rangefinder-type configuration (specifically including a viewfinder) with advanced amateur or better controls, RAW capability, hot shoe, and a decent lens.In the digital world, with current technology - no matter how much you spend - that involves compromises.  Do I wish that Canon had opted for a sensor with fewer megapixels?  Yes.  Would I like a better viewfinder?  Yes.  Are there noise issues, even at fairly modest ISO values?  Yes. Is it a bit of a brick?  Yes again.It's still the single best camera of its type on the market.  I had high hopes for the Nikon P6000, but those were dashed by its write performance and loss of settings when shooting RAW.  The G10 has a well-implemented feature set, good controls, and very good image performance over a range of reasonably bright conditions.  While its imaging performance falls off in other conditions, so does that of lesser cameras as well - the difference is just not that dramatic.The best alternative right now is probably Panasonic's Lumix DMC-LX3.  While it does not have a viewfinder and involves other compromises I would not make, there is no doubt whatsoever that its imaging performance is excellent - and surpasses that of the G10.Long story short: Until better sensors come along, the G10 is the best you will find.

I have to be because my clients are; I'm not that way out of OCD although I do suffer from OCD. I am a DSLR user, a user of professional lenses, and someone who takes pictures for almost solely the purpose of selling them commercially.I got started about 6 months ago looking for a compact camera that I could take with me everywhere I go, since taking my pro gear is not always feasible for a multitude of reasons. I tried out a few things personally but mostly I did exhaustive research. My standards are very high since I rarely take pictures for personal use or for fun. My research was made confusing because I have seen both excellent and not so excellent test shots made with this camera posted online. In my experience, the good ones were more accurate. Some of the test shots online seriously make me wonder since my results have been much better. Look up the online comparison between this camera and a $40,000 Hasselblad. Those are more in line with what I am seeing. I am happy to say that this camera has exceeded my expectations and I really like it generally.I am going to randomly name a few things about this camera that I really like:Noise: If you are like me, this is the most important issue to you. I don't do low-light shooting so low noise at low ISO is the only thing of importance to me. That being said, I have zero tolerance for noise. The noise at ISO 80 on this camera is indistinguishable from the noise of every DSLR I have used! That is such a huge deal. I wish I could have put that sentence in bold and 18 point type. I just don't see any difference, and my eye is very well trained from using Photoshop 4+ hours per day. I am positive that prints will bear out the same result. ISO 100 is virtually indistinguishable, certainly enough that in almost all photos you will not see a difference and you will almost certainly see no difference in prints either. I won't be shooting higher than ISO 100 on this camera so I can't tell you about the performance at those levels. I don't normally shoot high ISOs anyway, but I will certainly not be attempting it with a compact P&S.; My gut tells me that it would do well, but I simply just don't have a use for the feature so I haven't checked.Grain: to the extent that there is noise at ISO 80/100 (every digital camera ever made has some level of noise), I have to say I really like the effect! It is much more natural than recent DLSR setups I have shot with. The grain looks like a very slow film type grain. Converted to B&W; it looks fantastic. This will be a great camera for street photography in that sense. I can already see that there will be prints--large prints--taken with this camera that will end up on a gallery wall. I converted a few pictures I took to B&W; and then looked at them on a 26\" LCD monitor and they look amazing. The grain is really just so realistic and artistic. I haven't really commented on this with other digital cameras I have reviewed because I haven't experienced such a noticeably realistic grain character with other cameras.Color accuracy: more accurate than virtually all cameras I have used with maybe the exception of the Canon 5D.LCD: the brightest and the most beautiful I have ever used on any camera, ever. Love the LCD.So, any problems at all? These are totally nit-picky and I include them only to be thorough. I am not complaning anf these are nowhere near the level of being a dealbreaker for owning the camera.Distortion: noticeable in many cases. This is easily correctable in a variety of ways, and you will really only feel the need to correct it if you are shooting wide open or you are shooting architectural/straight-line subjects. It's a P&S; camera so this is to be expected anyway.CA: not as bad as I thought so I am pleasantly surprised here, however there is some in certain shots. Again correctable and not really a big deal. Again it's a P&S; camera so this is to be expected anyway.Shooting at f/2.8: It is noticeably soft and the CA gets much worse here also. I won't be shooting at this aperture very often anyway, but after seeing test shots at f/2.8 I will try even harder to avoid this aperture. Anything smaller than f/2.8 and everything's fine. Again this being a P&S; it gets a pass.Construction: Holding the camera right takes some getting used to. It doesn't just go into your palm like a glove like many cameras do. It takes some practice to find the right way to hold it; it isn't intuitive. The camera is also larger and heavier than I thought it would be but it is still within the limit of what I needed and the \"solid-ness\" is reassuring as far as long-term use and/or resale value is concerned.In summation, I was worried that there were too many pixels crammed into this camera and it delayed my purchase for a while until I could do more research and hear from owners. I was assured by many owners that the MP cramming hadn't had a deleterious effect on IQ so I took a chance. Amazon does allow returns, after all, so what the hey. I'm happy that I did because the camera has met or exceeded my high expectations and I will be keeping the camera.

Cheng \"Just the facts\"", "ReviewID": "R11X3475D22F6Y", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I've been a recent subscriber to the great Canon G10 vs Panasonic LX3 debate. This is a decision you're going to have to face if you're looking for the top point and shoot. I read a million reviews and still could not decided. The Web is great, but the Web is diverse!  I decided I had to handle both cameras. That was important to me. The Canon G10 feels great. It has enough weight so it feels secure in your hand. The LX3 has that \"itty bitty shooter\" feel that 99 percent of all compacts have. It's a little longer than most compacts, but it's still quite light and delicate feeling. I prefer the g10's feel, by far. I also loved the controls on the G10. I think if you want to mess around with exposure, aperture and speeds, there's no contest. The layout of the G10 takes it.  I love the spinning thumb wheel for scrolling through speed. For me, the least amount of electronic menus you have to navigate, the better. Now, I've looked at hundreds of comparison shots and I'm STILL undecided. The best of LX3 shots are just phenomenal - smooth and creamy -- but looking deeper into their history, they're usually taken by pros with off-camera strobes and the best setups.  I've likewise seen many of your 'average Joe\" shots taken with the LX3 that look, well, very average. I'm not even impressed with some of the samples taken by a pro at the Panasonic website. But it's practically the same story with the G10. I've seen great and I've seen blah.... But there is something more dynamic about the LX3 photos when they're good ones. And I respond to that artistry deeply.  I found a website comparing the dynamic range of the two cameras and the LX3 beats the G10, which I think explains their differences.  So this is one of the hardest camera choices I've ever had to make, There IS NO SIMPLE ANSWER! I think if I lived in a perfect world where I could play Cartier Bresson all day I'd take the Panasonic. But for carrying around to take snapshots, family pics, graduations, I'd have to go with the Canon just for the telephoto lens (and not an extravagant one at that). I used to shoot 35mm and, frankly, the 60mm \"zoom\" on the LX3 is no zoom at all. I'm mean, the standard lens on cameras were 50mm or 52mm. That's a 1:1 ratio. So a 60mm is basically nothing - you're just going from wide angle to normal. No 'zoom.' Again, this is really a tough call. But one thing swaying me toward the G10 is practicality in real world situations. I found a website that describes how the G10 was a popular choice on a recent Antarctic exploration and that they bore up well under that climate. I probably won't get that extreme with mine, but if I were forced to hold both cameras and drop one (under gunpoint, that would have to be!) I'd drop the G10 and feel better about it. The LX3 is nicely made, but it looked and felt fragile to me. It actually felt more fragile than my daughter's Canon 770 point and shoot which is smaller, but a block of metal that seems to weigh the same. If the LX3 had felt like that, I wouldn't have worried so much about durability.  I also think light aluminum is more liable to damage than the G10's magnesium alloy. So real world vs perfect world. The wealthy artist in me says get the LX3 and live the life of light and perfect ---  the family man with a tendency to bump things says the G10 and 'you probably won't break it....' I guess I should just reckon with who I really am.... and get the G10.

The depth of field using the small lens/sensor, ie 6mm focal distance for the 28mm field of view, make the Dof quite good at f5.6 of f8 (f8 is fully closed down). I plan to use it for landscapes with a tripod, and suspect it will work well. (see Darwin Wiggett and his G9 landscapes). It also has a 3 stop ND (neutral density) filter setting to help blur water or clouds in scenes, as well as a nifty panostitching feature that makes it easy to overlap, line up, and lock up exposure and WB settings for the pano, so it merges later in software easily.I also like the Custom 1 and custom 2 dial settings, to quickly go to your favorite settings.Nitpicks: i wish the grip was more rubberized, and easier to grip.The viewfinder is tiny, especially for me with glasses, so I will likely just use the LCD.", "Date": "October 10, 2008"}, {"Title": "Absolutely stunning results, easy use and feature set", "Author": "Larry Sribnick", "ReviewID": "R1WXBN5FNM4PPF", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I've never written an Amazon review for any product before, but I feel that Canon has done such a superb job with the G10 that they deserve some kind words.I am the former Color Editor at Popular Photography Magazine. I normally use a digital SLR, but I wanted a smaller, simpler camera for use in taking photos from an aircraft. I needed a camera that I could hold securely in one hand while flying the aircraft with the other. I have a Canon Elf, but it's almost impossible to hold the camera in one hand as it's just too small.I guess I bought the G10 for its grip-ability. I assumed it would take reasonably good photos because I've always been happy with the digital Elf, but I was unprepared for how good it is. If you're a serious amateur or a pro, you will be more than happy with the photographs the G10 produces. The results are stunning. The feature set is just as good. Your every need has been anticipated and a control positioned closely at hand. Easy ISO setting, exposure compensation, and control of flash output for sync-sun shooting are all easily at hand. There are even two custom settings that allow you to pre-program the features you'll need for special applications. I use one which sets the shutter speed at shutter priority at 1/1000 sec. and the focus pre-set at infinity for air to ground photography. I use a the second custom setting with the shutter priority set at 1/100 sec for taking photos that include the spinning propeller. High shutter speeds freeze the prop making it look as if the engine has stopped. I programmed it so it also kicks in the neutral density filter and again the focus set at infinity.Frankly, the results from the G10 are so good, that if I didn't have such a large investment in another brand of Digital SLR lenses, I would switch to Canon SLR's because of the G10. It's always the lenses, not the bodies that keep you with a particular brand of camera.I could go on and on telling you how wonderful the G10 is and how much it's like a digital Leica, but I think you already get the idea.

My first digital camera was a Nikon4300 which was the first generation of cameras of this type.  It was an \"ok\" camera.  Pictures came out decent but the lag time in between shots was annoying.  It had \"some\" manual function which I liked but after 4 years of owning it I was ready to move up to something more similar to my old Minolta X700.

Don't let that stop you because you can set the G10 to AUTO(ISO)-AUTO(mode) and \"grow from there.\"  Once I read pages 47 and 49 of the 300-page manual I really felt that I \"had a grip\" and the rest quickly fell into place.  I would suggest exploring the seventeen scene modes, which are sometimes ironically called \"amateur modes\" --those are devised by people with expertise not only in photography but in this camera as well.  (The \"night snapshot\" mode is neat!)  Tip for newbies:  no features can substitute for a basic photography course.  :-)For the serious: it can shoot in raw mode, has a hot shoe and tripod mount, and does AWB.  One has several choices for how to auto-focus and where to meter light.  To pick an example of the internal processing capabilities: you can show one color and have the rest of the shot in black and white.This is a mature product with well thought-out controls.  It's a rugged little unit that I just pack without its own case.  It has taken an immoderate amount of jostling and bumping against hard surfaces without a glitch.  My only beef was that the power switch on mine requires a hard press, but now I'm glad because that may be keeping it from coming on inside my suitcase.One feature that makes my life easier:  when I get to my destination I can just change the time zone instead of the date & time.Since I don't need a case to carry any sundries, I just use the included strap.  I can sling the strap over a shoulder and then pull a polo-style shirt on over it.  The shirt keeps the camera from bouncing around too much, and the strap is long enough to allow me to pull the camera out of the neck and shoot a picture.  It also conceals the camera.Battery life is astounding, especially for a camera with a CCD (as opposed to CMOS) sensor!  I just got back from a two-week trip and never used the charger.  I only shot a couple hundred photos (but mostly with flash) and one-minute movies, but I did plenty of viewing.  The power indicator still shows full.The G10 software will not install on my tiny \"netbook\" computer due to the netbook's limited resolution (1024x600 maximum).  But the netbook will still read images, either from the camera or directly from the SD card.  Canon's software is not without its aggravations but there is a toll-free support line with helpful, native-english-speaking technicians answering it.I set out to find the best compact for times I don't want to lug SLR equipment, and I am convinced that I found it.

For example, while all the digicams I've owned had the capability to tweak exposure values,  this is the only one where one doesn't have to be a hand contortionist to do it. The camera is fast and responsive and it rivals my old Nikon Coolpix 800 in terms of picture quality (My Fuji Finepix S5100 is a little short in that area, and that was part of my motivation to get this camera).Now, about expectations:  One thing that is well documented in various reviews about the Powershot G10 is its poor performance (in terms of excessive noise and artifacts) in low light situations at high ISO speeds.  Indeed, I see noise starting to creep in at ISO 400 and getting worse and worse as I go from 800 to 1600.  I haven't even bothered with trying ISO 3200 yet.  However, I saw those reviews, too, and knew that going in.  I rarely take pictures in those conditions, so I figured this wouldn't cramp my style too much,  so my expectations have been met.  It is quite good as long as I keep at it ISO 400 or lower.  It really shines at 100 or 200, which is where I operate mostly.  But it is definitely compromised at ISO 800 and up,  so be aware of that if you're looking for a low light camera.One other tip:  The PowerShot G10 uses a proprietary NB-7L battery, which Canon (and Amazon) charges a ridiculous price for.  There are generic versions of this battery (with more mAH, too) for a fraction of the cost.  So don't let the battery put you off too much.", "Date": "January 11, 2009"}, {"Title": "More speed required", "Author": "Parka", "ReviewID": "R21CUC9M0KIHDE", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I bought the G10 so as not to bring around a DSLR (400D). After looking at lots of G10 samples on the Internet, I felt that the ISO performance matches my F31fd. I'll do my review in the good and bad point format.I'm a hobbyist and don't print photos. All my photos are for web view typical 1024px wide.--------------------------------------------------------------------------Good--------------------------------------------------------------------------Image quality- Image quality is very good for a P&S; camera. The colours for my photos turned out really well. And there's RAW for more tweaking.Focal length- Great range at 28-140mm. My typical usage on a DSLR is 28-88mm equivalent. I rarely go up to 140mm.Lens speed- It's great at the wide end f2.8. But goes down to f4.5 on the telephoto. Focusing on this end is slow.  I've a lot of blurred people shots when shooting at f4.5. I've to turn the ISO up very high.Noise- I felt that it's comparable to my F31fd, which means it's great. Your noise tolerance might be different. For me, and my web images, I can go up to ISO 800. The drawback is contrast and color starts degrading at higher ISOs. My view on noise is: As long as it doesn't distract the viewer from the photo, it's alright.Dials- The exposure, ISO and mode dials are brilliant. I shoot at wrong ISO on my DSLR frequently, not on the G10.Design and build- Excellent. Feels really good in hand.Battery life- Excellent. It can go up to 400 shots.File transfer speed- True USB2.0 speed. It's very fast.Menu- Clear and simpleLCD- Large, clear and bright.--------------------------------------------------------------------------Bad--------------------------------------------------------------------------Focusing speed- This is major drawback. Even at f2.8, it focuses as fast as I can say \"focusing\". It's worse at f4.5. I'm very impatient and always press the shutter full without looking at the LCD focus to get the shot. It's very challenging to do people shots, almost impossible when the subjects are slightly moving, unless again the ISO is very high.Speed of the camera- When reviewing images, half pressing the shutter will take a split second to go back to shooting mode. After shooting, the image takes another split second to appear on LCD for review. I'm pampered by my DSLR which offers instant switching between review and shoot mode.Speed of the zoom- There are seven stops. It seems to take forever from wide to telephoto. If I see a great shot and my camera is not in the correct zoom range, I have the dreaded feeling of missing the shot.14.7MP- There's no real advantage here with respect to noise. There's no difference in noise level from shooting 5MP and 14.7MP at any ISO. Image quality is the same if I shoot big and scale down. You can print larger images though, but I don't print.Optical viewfinder- 77% coverage. It's almost useless to use it for framing. Every time I accidentally move the viewfinder to my eyes to use it, I feel disappointed.--------------------------------------------------------------------------Conclusion--------------------------------------------------------------------------To be honest, even though it takes great pictures, I was very disappointed by all the functional speed issues. I'm very surprised that most of the reviews I've read on the Internet said it was a snappy performance camera. Maybe my expectations are too high comparing it to a DSLR's speed.It's not fair to compare the image quality to a DSLR so I won't. But given its small sensor, I must say it produces spectacular photos.But the thing is, sometimes a great picture moment only appears for an instant. If the camera isn't fast enough to capture that, spectacular photos doesn't matter anymore.For me, an impatient guy, the drawback on speed is enough to balance all the good points.I would recommend this camera for shooting things that don't move a lot, e.g. landscape, holidays with posing people etc.", "Date": "November 28, 2008"}, {"Title": "why I like the G10", "Author": "L.

This camera is at the top of the heap of the P+S (along with 1 or 2 others).

Most other modes are only one level deep in a menu. Full manual is a snap to use, and RAW mode is easily available. The G10 has a hot shoe, but not a PC connection for external flash.Small gripes: I wish the scenic modes were right on the main dial, but there are so many this might not be practical. The smallish optical viewfinder (tied to the zoom) is nice, but covers only about 3/4 of the actual view, so what can I really use it for except rough estimates?I actually showed some of my G10 shots to a photo dept. technician and he thought they'd been taken with an SLR. If you are looking for very high quality images and SLR like versatility without the bulk of an SLR, get this camera.

It combines a great mix of attributes that add up to a fantastic camera to carry everywhere. I have been toting it all over Manhattan and have shot hundreds of pictures now. Having the creative control to set aperture and shutter speed allows one to fine tune exposure in a way that has not really been possible with point and shoots. The fact that it shoots large raw files is an added bonus. I am a little put out with Adobe for not including G10 support in a version of camera raw that works with CS3. Grrrrr. It is really nice to be able to work a raw file and have the same flexibility that I do with the files from my D200. The battery seems to have been conjured up by the enegizer bunny, it just keeps going and going. It literally will go for hundreds of shots between charges. The control layout also works very well. The exposure compensation dial on the left side is so easy to manipulate when you are shooting in either full auto, aperture priority, or shutter priority. ISO and shooting mode on the right are also easy to access. The controls all feel very solid and provide positive feedback as they are manipulated.

But after a number of years, I was frustrated with the quality of indoor shots and the inability to capture movement well.So I began my research. I went to many camera review sites, consumer reports, a recent NPR review and about 10 other comparison reviews.I was looking for a great point and shoot with capabilities to override most settings. I needed a camera that I could pack away and take on family trips and also take artistic shots.I also needed something fairly durable since I can be rough on cameras.I went to a local camera shop with my list in hand and tried out the Canon Powershot SX10IS. This is a great camera with a ton of capabilities and telephoto power but it was way too big for me to carry it around on family excursions and also had a removable lens cap. I also looked at the Canon PowerShot SX200IS which was also a terrific camera. The drawback to that model was the lack of some features and the fact that you had to tell the flash to pop up (although the camera would prompt you).I really wanted the power of the SX10 with the convenience of the SX200. Then I saw the G10. WOW. It is a beautifully designed exterior, a little retro in appearance. I have to admit that as usual, Amazon has the best price but since this local camera shop spent so much time talking to me about all the cameras will give me tutorials on this model for as long as I need them, I ended up paying the higher price and keeping my local economy going.It has a tough case with a rough grip in many places. The buttons are in convenient places and easy to read.The things I really liked: the lens has its own retractable cap so there is no lens cap to worry about popping off. The flash is automatic but has an override. The LCD display is huge and beautifully clear, allowing you to see clearly whether you missed the shot and need to take another one. There is a flash hot shoe for adding light. The wide angle is a must on any camera I have these days and the zoom is perfect.The most amazing thing (that is obviously the selling point to any camera) is the quality of photos. I can take an indoor shot of someone, with low light from about 8 feet away and zoom in to see every hair on their head.

Of course, you can't beat a 50D with L-series lens next to a point and shoot; but my photos looked pretty darn good in comparison!The biggest negative to this camera is the shooting speed.  An SLR just has that edge over a point and shoot in terms of how many pics/second you can shoot and I find this to be the most annoying quirk to the G10, but obviously not an unexpected one.

This CANON POWERSHOT G10 is near the top of the \"point-and-shoot\" list and it makes a great back-up camera for pros or pro-sumers. However, it  has some short-comings that may affect your decision to get this camera.  So, here is the breakdown:PROS:- MANUAL CONTROL, giving control of exposure and aperture settings.- RAW FORMAT is supported which is highly recommended for post-editing your images on your computer with Photoshop CS4, for example.- beautiful large screen is pleasure to review your shots.- SMART BLACK DESIGN feels sturdy and has rubber gripping.- 5X ZOOM is better than the standard 3X (included on most current point-and-shoots).- ON-BOARD EDITING to crop or rotate your photos.- RECHARGEABLE BATTERY AND DOCK INCLUDED. a better option than using alkaline and this battery last for a long time- 14.7 MEGAPIXELS for large-sized printsCONS:- ODD PLACEMENT OF MANUAL CONTROLS. it would have been nice to have dedicated dials for the exposure and aperture, rather than the ISO speeds and compensation.- BATTERY IS SQUARE, making it easy to put the battery in the wrong direction.- BAD LOW LIGHT RESPONSIVENESS. low-light shots are only good if you are willing use are tripod or keep very still.- LAG. as a premium camera, it bothers me that there is lag - meaning a long time from the moment you press the shutter button to the moment the picture is written to the card.- CONTINUOUS SHOT MODE IS SLOW. you will miss a lot of moments if you want to capture action shots.- VIDEO IS STANDARD QUALITY, but then again, this supposed to be a still camera, not a video cameraAll in all, if you don't mind the slowness of the camera, having so much control is a welcome strength in the G10 as a point-and-shoot.

The EV wheel on top of the camera is very useful. The improved grip and bigger LCD screen are very nice additions when compared to the G7.The RAW capability is nice when taking pictures indoors or when shooting landscapes, but I prefer Jpegs when shooting street photography. The Jpeg conversion is very good, and the photos come out great with the in-camera processing.The E-TTL metering works very well. The photos always come out correctly exposed. It also works great with the 430EXII and 580 EXII flashguns when shooting indoors.The lens is improved, and is nice and sharp across the range. The edge sharpness is also improved compared to the G7.The shots up to ISO 400 look great on prints up to A4. Small prints are very usable at ISO 800, but wouldn't print at A4 without noise reduction( I use Dfine 2 for this purpose). At base ISO you can print at A2 and get great results.There are some minor drawbacks, though:- The shutter is placed right on top of the camera. It would be more confortable to have it on top of the grip, in a slight angle( like on a DSLR).- The zoom joystick is placed on the shutter. I would prefer it on the back( where the thumb rest when holding the camera). This way I don't need to take my index finger off the shutter when zooming.- The optical viewfinder, although better than the one on the G7, still suffers from parallax error, and is way too small.-  The movie mode doesn't support HD recording. It should be possible to record in 720p with this camera.- Noise at high ISO( 800 and 1600) is very high. Iso 1600 shouldn't be used except when really desperate. ISO 800, as stated above, is fine for small prints, and up to A4 with NR)- The tripod mount is not centered with the lens.Compared to the LX3: The G10 holds its own in most departments; has better ergonomics and build quality. The IQ is equal to the LX3. Noise levels at same image size is equal. In low light the LX3 is better thanks to the faster lens( you can shoot with the LX3 at 1 stop lower ISO, which translates into less noise). The LX3 lens is wider( great for indoors and landscapes), but shorter( stops at 60mm, while the G10 reaches 140mm tele). it's hard to pick out a winner.

I finally decided to buy a point and shoot for myself.  I have been using the Canon G10 for around 6 months and I am extremely happy with the camera and its images.  I was concerned about the reviews, which indicated the noisy image quality at ISO's higher than 200.  I agree that at higher ISO's there is noise.

For 99.9% of what I use the G10 for - events, parties, gatherings, family get togethers, etc. the camera is excellent.In very low light conditions I'll use the on-camera flash for shots that don't require much flash or I'll use my Canon Speedlites and I can illuminate any situation.  I have operated 3 Speedlite flashes with my canon G10 and radio controlled flash receivers and the results are extremely nice. I have only printed images to 11x14 with the G10 since most of the images are not portraits or of anything that I needed larger than 11x14. I suspect prints could easily go to 16x20 or 20x24 and for most people, that would be an extremely large image to hang in their house.The camera is much larger than most of the point and shoot cameras, but since I'm used to lugging 30 lbs of equipment around, the G10 feels tiny.

Since the advent of digital cameras, I've been playing with them (starting with a 1.2m Olympus) and finally sold off the remaining film gear around 2000, making the full transition to digital. Unfortunately, until now, I haven't found the ideal digital camera.The Canon G10 just might be that perfect little camera, at least for me. Controls, form-factor, resolution, overall image quality... all add up to make a very capable and high quality instrument. The joy of being able to do a long exposure night shot and get immediate gratification by reviewing the image is unmeasurable. Amazing my kids with flashlight painted shots and time-lapse is cool. Having video on-hand is tremendous. Of course, shooting touristy snap-shots and capturing in RAW to enable that 2-stop correction magic is a given. Easily placed controls and menu-less access to most functions make daily use quick and rewarding. No more squinting at menus to try and set shutter priority or ISO, just press the button and turn the knob.My G10 replaced a bulky Canon D400 (Rebel XTi) that I typically carried around with a 28-135 zoom on it. I travel extensively and found that carrying the D400 was just too much trouble. While the D400 is an awesome camera with similar features (lower resolution and no video capability), it's bulk and traditional compact SLR form-factor were too much for me. The SLR, through the lens shooting method is compensated for on the G10 by a decent and reasonably accurate range-finder though I have found the large LCD to be more useful for framing and even quick shooting.If what you are looking for is an all around point-and-shoot, this might not be it. The G10 is targeted to a different market segment. If you are looking for that one camera to own if you understand photography, enjoy pushing the limits and having a little extra capability and you don't want to jump into a full SLR configuration, this is the camera for you.

I used Kodak's software for the last 4 years, and loved the simplicity of it. With Kodak, all you have to do is plug in the camera and go. All I want is to see my videos, see my photos, and easily crop the photos. Period.The Canon software won't let me view my videos at all, even though there are no less than 4 separate Canon programs to install. None of those 4 programs allow me to view the video. One of the pieces of software is only for one kind of Canon camera, which I don't have, and the other two programs are basically the same thing. Neither of those have a crop button--really! I can mess with the colors and do all this fancy stuff but I can't crop.So, basically, all the software is essentially useless for me after the photos get downloaded into the My Pictures file of my computer. Then I have to use Picassa or some other software. Although, when I took the memory card out of the Canon and put it into the Kodak, the Kodak software worked just fine, so I might just do that.Anyway, other than crap software, the camera is amazing. Obviously, I wanted simple, but my husband wanted complicated. We both got what we wanted. I operated all of the features I wanted without touching the instruction manual. The anti-blur, face detection, and red-eye reducer are all automatic and work very well (you can turn them off if you want). You can easily turn the flash on or off. There is an easy Macro setting. Working the timer is also easy, and there is one timer that detects when all of the faces are looking at the camera before taking the picture. The many SCN settings are found by just turning the wheel. Best of all, this camera is super-fast. I can turn it on and take a picture almost as soon as I see what I want to photograph. Zooming is pretty fast, too.Like I mentioned, though, my husband wanted complicated. He wanted to be able to adjust all the settings, including the aperture and a bunch of other things. He can. There are tons of settings that I carefully avoid and, for those people (like him) who know what all those settings mean, they can spend hours getting exactly the photo they want. My husband will have to work hard to outgrow the abilities of this camera, and I bet the software would work well for him, as it is definitely intended for someone more at his level than mine.The photos and videos from the Canon work on Blogger just fine, and don't take any longer to upload, which was vital for me.In summary, the camera and software are great for people who want a point-and-shoot with lots of capabilities, while the camera is equally great for people who want a fast, easy-to-use camera that gives you high-quality, crisp photos for printing or Blogging.", "Date": "December 26, 2008"}, {"Title": "Canon G10 My opinion any way", "Author": "P.

In this time period I shot both professionally and also as a hobby for my own enjoyment. I was looking for a quality compact camera that would subsidies my medium format and DSLR equipment. When the G9 canon came out I purchased one for this purpose. The G9 was a great camera and met all my requirements except for one thing, the limited and slow wide angle lens (7.4-44.4mm f/2.8-4.8) that  the G9 had. When Canon replaced it with the G10 having the wider but still slow (6.1-30.5mm f/2.8-4.5) lens I thought the wider lens on the G10 was the answer to what I had been looking for in a compact camera. Nothing could be farther from the truth. I ordered the G10 and was very disappointed primarily with the performance of the G10 at wide angle photographs. The G10 had terrible chromatic aberration's at wide angle that were horrific. The lens got better as it was zoomed to longer focal lengths but this glaring problem at wide angle made the camera useless for me. I posted an actual sample of how bad this problem is in the image gallery for the G10 under \"chromatic aberration's\". Another annoying problem was that the diopter adjustment in the optical zoom viewfinder was more like adjusting a pair of $9.95 binoculars into focus. No matter how the adjustment was made complete sharpness across the viewing field could not be made. I realize that with the LCD screen the view finder was perhaps a secondary option. But for a camera in this price range both these faults are unacceptable. I returned the G10 and bought the Leica D-LUX 4 and haven't looked back since. Yes, Yes I know the Leica is more expensive than the G10 but it's fast (5.1-12.8 f2.0-2.8) Vario-Summicron lens is fantastic. Having used Leica range finder camera's over the years I can say the D-LUX 4 images have that unique look that Leica film cameras capture and are noted for. Also the D-LUX 4 came with a 3 year warranty and Capture One soft wear.Perhaps I received a bad copy and this camera had unusual problems. Either way I can't see how it passed Canon's quality control.

Canon states that this camera is for the \"advanced amateur\". (It's usually the Pros that complain the most.) Its a very sexy looking camera that has a lot of cool features that can make some beautiful images if you have a good understanding of photography. It can go full automatic for those of you who don't (yet). The camera feels like quality, from weight (13 oz.) to the clicks of the knobs, to the smoothness of the lens movements. The battery lasts a good 400 shots if you don't do the on camera slide shows or forget to shut it off (it has power saving feature as well). If you ask me, it's about as good as a $400 - $500 camera can get. The rest of this review is for the ones who are worried about the negative reviews still.It's not going to stand up to a DSLR but it will give you very high quality vacation, wedding guest, birthday and family event type pictures. I am told you can get a very acceptable 11 X 14 print from it. I use it to find interesting locations for pro shoots and shutter bugging or if I just want to give my shoulder a rest from carrying around a DSLR. If you shoot a lot of night scenes, this camera may NOT be for you (there aren't too many affordable DSLR's that can't pull this off either) you will see noise (red, green and blue colored digital grain). Here's why, in the simplest terms I can think of: Think of the sensor as a very smart solar panel (smart because it sees colors too). It generates electricity when light hits it  telling the brain of the camera that there is a certain amount of light intensity there. If there is no light, you get blackness, no electricity. If you try to force detail into an area of a picture that is absent of light, by using a long shutter time, you get noise. It could be a stray signal from the camera's system or other heavily scientific stuff going on to cause these dots. AND IF YOUR SHOOTING BELOW A 1/4 OF SECOND, EVEN WITH A HIGH ISO, YOU WILL GET SOME DEGREE OF NOISE. It's the nature of of the digital format. Use a flash.Raw Format, although very impressive with it's \"oops!\" correction abilities, will not save every image. It should not be used as a crutch or a cheat. It still needs to be exposed within a reasonable exposure latitude or \"in the ball park\".OK. I'm down off my soap box. Great little camera.

The requirements were: RAW files, wide angle lens, fast response (after my S70, anything would look fast, though). And of course excellent image quality. I bought the G10 because, well, I'm a Canon guy, and it had a larger zoom range and an optical viewfinder, even though the lens barely squeaks by as \"wide\".After five months of owning the G10, I sold it last week and ordered a Panasonic LX3 the same day. I'm not sure how the LX3 is going to to work out, but I had a love/hate relationship with the G10 from day one. I do a lot of outdoors stuff, mountaineering, skiing, kayaking, etc. The G10 is just too big and heavy for those situations, so I found myself dreading having to drag it along and so sometimes didn't. I would bet a considerable sum that if you take a G10 apart, you'll find a lot of unnecessary metal, put there by the Canon marketing department to give the G10 a satisfying, Leica-like heft and density. Also, I like an optical viewfinder because it allows me to turn off the display and conserve battery power on multiday trips. But the optical viewfinder is just not usable - it is pitifully inaccurate, the lens protrudes in the frame, and there are no markings to help line things up (useful since the protruding lens has distorted your perception of angles and proportions).I may be the only one on the planet to say this, but I think the G10 is an ergonomic disaster. Sure, it's great to have those nice big metal dials on top, and it gives the camera a nice Leica look. And the menu system is just fine, no issues there. But that's only half the story. The back of the camera, under your thumb, is plastered with little protruding plastic resistanceless buttons, not to mention a slippery protruding plastic combination of control wheel and five control buttons about the size of my thumbnail. I'm constantly hitting all those little buttons and sending it into manual focus, or turning off the display, or whatever. I've even glued little plastic bumpers to the back to try and protect the little buttons (doesn't work). Manual exposure is an unbelievable nightmare of finding and pushing a tiny button to cycle through shutter speed/f-stop/meter mode (meter mode!!) and then use that slippery tiny little wheel to set the value - and don't accidentally click one of the five even tinier buttons inside the tiny wheel. Use with gloves? Forget it. If you've used a Canon 20D DSLR or better you know Canon understands ergonomics. Even my old Canon S70 is light-years ahead in ergonomics, if you ask me. So why did Canon do this to the G10?  I should have been prepared for this, I returned an S80 after two days for the very same control issues.But the worst issue for me, the G10 produces the largest percentage of truly awful images of any camera I've ever owned, and we're going back to some pretty primitive film cameras here. I'm not sure what the problem is, perhaps limited dynamic range due to the high pixel count, combined with a strong tendency towards overexposure, possibly my own laziness but it's certainly not ignorance. I find I really have to work at not getting the blinking overexposure warnings on the playback images. If I wanted to work that hard, I'd have brought my DSLR and gotten better images. And do not ignore the reports of others that noise is an issue even at relatively low ISOs - it definitely is a problem. I always shoot RAW, so don't think that's the solution.The lens is sharp and reasonably free of distortion and fringing, although of limited usefulness at longer focal lengths due to its dimness. The RAW files can process out to some very nice images with either the included Digital Photo Professional or Photoshop CS4's Camera Raw. (Previous versions of Photoshop will never handle the RAW files, so you may need to upgade Photoshop for a couple of hundred bucks if you need that).It is true the G10 is capable of stunning images in exactly the right conditions (plenty of low-contrast light) and I have quite a few. But that's not what you get capturing a sunrise on a mountaintop, and you don't get any images at all if you blow off taking the camera because it's too heavy. I've ended up thinking of the G10 as kind of like an old manual exposure 35mm camera loaded with Kodachrome 25. Big, heavy, awkward to use. Can make great, outstanding photos. Usually doesn't.", "Date": "February 17, 2009"}, {"Title": "Canon G10 is a superior camera", "Author": "Gregory J. Ciallella", "ReviewID": "R3AC3CAT3PU2AN", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I have owned the G10 for many many months now.  I purchased it within a few weeks of its release, and after some \"hands on\" at the local Ritz Camera shop.  I also researched this camera extensively on the internet.  I made direct comparisons to its Nikon (P6000) and Lumix (Panasonic DMC FX-150) competetors.  In addition, I have the following accessories.  Wide angle lens, 2X telephoto lens, converter tube, several macro and filter sets, and the \"Magic Lantern G10\" help book.  I have also ordered the new Speedlite 270ex flash, but have not received it yet.  My picture counter reads just under a thousand exposures.When I first received my G10, I was very pleased.  As I had already put my hands on the camera, I was not suprized by its heft.  This camera is larger than the typical point and shoot, and thus a bit heavier.  You can not comfortably put this camera in your shirt or back pocket.  It will fit in a cargo pant's side pocket.  It is still portable with a belt case or in a purse without much hassle.The build quality is expectional, and even though larger, very comfortable to hold (even one handed).  I wear a man's medium sized glove for comparison.  In my opinion, its size and heft actually help with holding the unit still.  When using the converter tube and the additional lenses, you can put your left hand under the \"barrell\" just like an SLR for additional support.This camera is a photo enthusiasts dream.  When I first opened the package, I was so excited, I had to start taking pictures immediately and without reading the manual.  I left the camera to completely automated settings and snapped at anything that moved or had color.  After about a hundred (particularly useless) photos, I realized that this camera takes absolutley gorgeous pictures even on its auto setting.  Colors are amazing and detail is tight.  I experienced no problems with white balance, focus/blur, or noise.  I was very pleased, as my wife has no interest in ISO and can care less about apeture, so as a point and shoot, she will be able to use this camera with wonderful results.The manual is very detailed, but like all manuals, difficult to \"read\".  So I purchased the \"Magic Lantern G10\" guide.  This is an excellent resource and is when my G10 truly started to shine.  Knowing not just how this camera does things, but why, has let me begin to use the G10 to a much fuller extent.  I mostly shoot in the more manual modes now.  The G10 has a complete full range of settings to allow an exceptional amount of creativity.  And the image quality is stunning.  As with most photography, I try to stay in that magic ISO range of 80 (the G10's lowest setting) to 400.  In regular light with good composition, I get fantastic clean pictures.  I have gone higher in the ISO with some small grains of noise.  But lets face it, if there was never a problem with noise, cameras would not have an ISO setting.  I hate it when people review (any) camera and complain about noise when it really is their own composition in question.  Saying that, this camera does do well in lower light situations.The features of image stabilization and a hearty 5X zoom with a 14.7mp sensor put this camera in top specs.  The LCD screen (920k) is really nice and the controls are all easy to manipulate and of quality build.  A great feature is the ability to take RAW images.  I recently got photoshop elements (version 7) as a present, and have had great fun.  Which is really what this hobby is all about.The G10 was a great purchase.  A quality camera with lots of features and creative room.  Fast auto focus, high image quality, excellent processing from the digic 4 chip, image stabilization, and canon glass all have made me very very happy with it.So after all this glowering review, what are my quibbles?  Just a couple really.  First, the longest exposure allowed is 15 seconds.  While 99.9% of exposures are fractions of a single second, I would like to have a 30 second shutter for some longer blur pictures or moon shots. Second, when using the converter, you have to turn off your AF lamp as the extending tube slightly blocks the lamps beam, and skews your autofocus.  (No problems if your not using the extender tube and additional add on lenses). Lastly, the flash takes about 3-4 seconds for a recharge.  If the flash is charging, the camera will not fire, and you might miss a shot.  I would love to see the camera automatically flip to a higher ISO and still take the picture without the flash rather than miss or make me wait.  However, I do not know of any camera that does this, or if it is even technologically possible.  Then again, thats why the G10 has a fully functional hot shoe, and I have ordered the new Speedlite 270ex flashgun.So minor quibbles aside, this camera deserves to be Canon's compact king.  An amazing camera that I can whole heartedly recommend.Thank you for reading my review.Greg", "Date": "May 31, 2009"}, {"Title": "best point and shoot I have ever owned", "Author": "Carbonadam \"Ladies and gentleman, I hope that...", "ReviewID": "R31THU1PJ14KNA", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This camera is for someone who knows what an F stop is, as well as aperture value. ISO speeds, RAW, exposure bracketing and more. If this is all Greek to you than move on, this is not the camera for you. This camera is for professional or amateur photographers who do not want to lug their big SLR with them everywhere. This camera has amazing quality and is very easy to use. It is also extremely flexible for people who know what they are doing. Exposure compensation, ISO, and shooting modes are all conveniently located on the camera with real actual dials. The camera looks and feels very classic. All black is beautiful. It's also metal and feels Hefty. Years ago when I used to shoot with real film cameras I could drop old Minoltas and Nikons and not be too worried. This feels like it might survive a small accidental fall. The design harkens back to some small miniature Lieca, Minox, or olympus models of long lost film models. James Bond might use this. It has a large battery and also a traditional viewfinder that even lets you focus it. The manual focus on the camera is it's weakest trait. You need to clumsily use the dial on the back. Had they only made the ring on the front adjust manual focus this would have been extra credit and A++. Still for a point an shoot to even have a manual focus option is great. This is a bit bulkier than the miniature card deck cameras available out there. It is still, in my opinion, small enough to put in your wife's purse, take to a wedding, and even place in ones suit pocket, minus the strap. You can buy add ons for this like a telephoto convertor and external flash. I guess if you only have this one camera and need as much flexibility as possible theses add ons could be helpful. I personally have a full frame SLR for all the times I need 100% flexibility, more lenses and such. I would only need the underwater case for this. Underwater cases for small cameras like this can be so much fun at pools and swimming at sea. All I need now is the Canon case, the underwater case and I'm set. I am not sure why point and shoot cameras do not have the same frame proportions to current SLRs by Cannon. Perhaps someone can explain this to me. I am sure it has to do with sensor size, or printing sizes or something. Still, My 20 D and 5D Mark II both are wider while this and my older SD 750 have a more narrow, more square file format. This is a mystery to me. You can set this to current TVs 16:9 aspect ratio but that is wider than the traditional SLRs. This must be an industry thing. Also, it's not a huge deal. I can not criticize the camera for this since it seems to have it's origins in the industry or point and shoots in general. I only shoot with Cannons now so it remains true to other point and shoot frame file format size.The rear screen is very big which is nice. You can also turn it off, which is nice too, especially when you are at a dark event where the lit up screen would be an annoyance to others. You can also disable the phony shutter click. For traditionalists who like that click, there are 3 versions to choose from. If only it had a photochemical darkroom smell. :)All in all a great camera. The price here is excellent too. I overpaid at Best Buy.I would like to add that Best Buy is charging $495.75 for this.

I have the Canon rebel xti and wouldn't trade it for anything, but there are times when you need portability.

My previous experiences with Canon won out and I went with the G10.  Out of box experience was perfect!!  I shot about 100 photos, and was very happy!  Sure, it isn't the fastest camera on earth and needs perfect light to stop movement, but I didn't need that, the Rebel can handle that!  It is a perfect example of Canon's brillant true to life colors, and the extra pixels do allow me to close crop when needed.  I also have the Panasonic Lumix FZ28 mainly for the optical zoom, and am amazed at the washed out colors of that compared to the G10.  I am especially happy with the right on top exposure compensation dial... I use that often photographing black dogs in white snow, and it's great not to have to go inside to a menu to find it.  Another great feature is the hotshoe... almost impossible to avoid red eye in the dogs with built in flashes, but using my speedlight is great!  Finally, the auto white balance is right on...

I've been spoiled by the legendary 6mp Fuji Finepix F30, which, although no longer in production for a couple of years now, is still considered to be the litmus test for low noise images at relatively high ISO.  There are many geeks out there comparing the Canon G10 and the Panasonic LX3 against the F30, and quite a few are saying that the F30 is still the champ.I have to say the F30 would beat the G10 at higher ISO's like Pacman beat De La Hoya in that recent embarrassing title fight.  When I tested the G10 at ASA 200 at the highest JPEG level, which I thought was a reasonable ISO, I was horrified by the noise.  Blown highlights and purple fringing.Disappointed, I quickly returned it.

The camera compensates with higher ISO and lower shutter speed, thus either creating considerable noise and/or blur.  Adjusting settings manually can overcome some of this, but not all.  Of course all PAS cams will make these adjustments in low light.  The problem with the G10 seems to be too many megapixels and too small of a sensor...something no amount of adjustments can compensate for.

First, the LCD screen was warped and that allowed dirt to get behind the screen making it very hard to see your image. I had that repaired. Then, so subtly as to go unnoticed at first, the focus got softer and softer until suddenly 9 of every 10 shots taken are out of focus. The only setting that I can use to get a clear shot now is the flower setting - and if you were wondering it is possible to take a portrait of someone on the flower setting. :) I have been unable to remedy this myself, and I even reset the camera (per Canon's instruction) but to no avail.I received an estimate for repair (~$200) from my local camera shop which is half the original price of the camera. I'm going to just say no for now.I am now looking at an SLR, Canon 50D perhaps, but in the back of my mind worry that the focusing problem may be a characteristic of the Canon brand. Maybe Nikon is the way to go. At any rate, this camera may not be worth your money should it develop similar issues.UPDATE: my friend bought her G10 at the same time as I did.

The camera's battery proved sufficiently sturdy enough to last all day even though photos and videos were taken almost constantly in below-freezing conditions.The only gripe I have with the camera is with the placement of the 'on' button.  You simply cannot press that button with gloves on and taking off your gloves in sub-freezing temperatures was uncomfortable to say the least.The extreme cold did not affect the camera's function, though.  Some snow got on the extended lens and melted into water, but the camera still works great.  Photo quality is excellent, even when compared to photos taken with my Canon EOS 10d SLR...not the best, but still an SLR.  The image stabilized lens is a big help in low-light conditions and the extreme-white background (all snow, all the time) was no match for the Automatic White Balance setting on the G10.  I left most of the settings alone and all of my photos came out wonderfully.  Hand-held self-portrait shots were easy to do because the lens is wide and the red-eye reduction beam is a highly visible green light which allows you to use it as a kind of laser aiming device...I never missed a hand-held shot like that even though I couldn't see the display on the back of the camera.  And what a display!  Big, clear, and it has several different settings depending on how much information you want to be displayed with your photo.  The built-in flash is quite powerful...too powerful in fact, but turning it down a few notches was easy after reading a few pages of the instruction manual (if you've ever owned a Canon PowerShot camera, the controls should be very intuitive to you.)  Facial recognition works great, I haven't experimented with it very much, but it's fun to watch the display show each person's face and track each person as they move around while you wait for the perfect shot.Videos are not HD, if that's what you're looking for you will be disappointed.  I consider myself more of a photographer than a videographer so that's really not an issue for me.  I did notice that the camera could not autofocus while a video was in progress.  For instance, I was filming my step-son up close, then tried to film some skiers far away in the distance while zooming in on them and the camera did not even attempt to re-focus on the distant skiers.If you are a dedicated SLR person like I was, looking for a good point-and-shoot camera to take on vacations that you wouldn't need a seperate backpack for, I highly recommend the Canon G10.", "Date": "January 2, 2010"}, {"Title": "not one of the best?

I'm an avid amateur.  I've owned the original Sony Mavica, a 2mp Toshiba, at least 5 Fuji's including an F30, F200EXR, F40FD, a Canon D40, Lumix FZ28, and now the G10.I had the idea of getting a G10 a year ago but was deterred by reviews that harped on too much noise. I like night photography, so I was put off.Then I started dating a fellow enthusiast and she had a G10.  No matter what pictures I took, and how nice they were (with F30 F40FD, D40 and  lumix FZ28 the G10 pics always looked better), so when I had a windfall a few weeks ago, I bought a G10.Well.Durability aside, (and you never know; one of my Fuji's had the same type of error) this camera is so good I sold all my fujis, lumix's and may unload my D40.The feel is old time remarkable, like a real camera.  Solid, easy to use, good layout of features.  Picture quality is remarkable.  I just took about 300 pictures in Old Quebec, in 6 degree weather, many at night, many hand held, some with stitch assist, some with tripod, one from a moving ferry. The color rendition, noise, resolution, are fabulous.  I hope it lasts forever.  Versatility, features are more than I want.  Would I want something else?  Are there nuances I like(d) better in other cameras?  Maybe.  OK, the owner's manual is a bit hard to figure and I bought a book to help me.  Not sure how to use red eye reduction; it seems to be in post processing rather than with 2 flashes.  Probably not a big deal.  The quality of the pictures is SO much better than the Lumix 28 that it isn't funny.  There's just no way they can compare.  I bought it because of the super long zoom and the Leica name.  NOT.But low light, noise, feel, features, image quality, ergonomics are remarkable.  Can you tell I love it?  Worth every penny.Well, i've had this for months and months now, and I recently bought an Olympus E-PL1 with the 14-150 Olympus Lens.  The Olympus takes remarkable pictures and it may replace my D 40.  But frankly, the G10 is still the best camera I own and if I HAD to take one camera it would be the G 10.  First, considering the nonsense about the lens getting grit dirt, or sand in it - I had this at Michigan's Silver lake dunes last week, filming and taking stills, in driving wind and sand, and no problems.  Second, this camera gives you far more flexibility than, say, the EPL1 - on the EPL1 for example, on \"macro\" all the settings are set.  On the Canon, you can use macro mode in any setting.  On the epl1 - not.  Second, the viewfinder(s) on teh canon are vastly superior to almost anything else i've seen.  The manual controls are indispensible and just so logical (eg. exposure control, ISO...The build is beautiful, solid, mostly metal.  The pictures rival my Nikon dSLR and my Epl1.  So much for large sensors being the only way to get great pictures.  Flash is sync'd faster than the epl1 so you can take daytime pics @ 1/2000 and black out the background, nice touch for flowers.  If the G11 is an improvement, then it is end of story.  I know about all the hype about micro 4/3, about the new sony full size sensor, etc. etc. but the bottom line in cameras is the picture, and then features, and this one takes remarkable pictures.

I've had it for about a week.  If, like me, you love the feel of your film-style dials, you will LOVE the layout of the G10.  Canon really got the ergonomics right on this one.  The aperture and f-stop controls remind me of my old gear... (on the LCD screen, you can scroll through your shutter speeds, etc.) this has made my digital transition easy and fun.  I've played around with my wife's digital cameras... but they never had that analog feel to them.  You can almost envision a roll of film inside of the solid G10.I know that RAW is all the rage, but even the JPGs look great from this camera.  And yes, I've shot it at high ISOs... and yes, there is noise, but like other(positive)reviews have said, it reminds me of film grain... doesn't bother me at all.  Try to stay under 800 if you can... if not, oh well... you'll have some graininess to your image.The G10 is the digital camera that film-lovers will fall in love with.  Is it as versatile as a DSLR?  No.  Personally, I'd rather have an awesome camera that's easy to bring along than another SLR with a bag full of expensive lenses.  Even with my film SLRs, I always ended up bringing along just one lens... too much of a hassle to lug the whole kit around.I'm LOVING my digital rangefinder-esque Canon G-10!", "Date": "May 4, 2009"}, {"Title": "Awesome!

My camcorder ran out of room on the card, so I recorded a singer on the G10, and, all things considered, found the music very listenable. It is small, so I can carry it anywhere, in contrast to a larger DSLR. The images are sharp. Macro is fun to play with as well as the digital zoom. The SX100 had 10X zoom, and I did lose a little bit, but with a tripod, the G10 goes up to 20X, though the images are rarely useful....but sometimes it all comes together.

Manual focus is really difficult in an LCD display.4. I have no control (that I know of) for the internal flash power.5. I really wanted a viewfinder camera.

You must do all of the set-up with the LCD and then if you desire you can sort of frame the picture with the viewfinder but why bother?6. Dont expect that just because it has 14.7 MP imager that it will make pictures like a Nikon D3 or even a D-70. This little imager adds a lot of noise into the image even when you dial the sensitivity down to 200 ISO.7. The LCD display shows everything the camera is doing to the point of complete distraction. It is so filled up with text and odd shaped icons that I can barely find the image I am photographing.OK I have been pretty tough on this little camera but only because I almost expected it to act like a Leica M8. It does not and it is not fair of me to compare it to that class of camera.  That said I carry it everywhere with me and it may be the best point and shoot digital I have ever owned.

During the first two weeks that I owned the camera, I noticed the noisy images, but initially downplayed or ignored them. But after viewing one noisy image after another, I finally and grudgingly had to admit that the Q10 had problems.About a month after I purchased my camera, dpreview reviewed the G10 and compared its image quality to a Panasonic LX3. The side-by-side image comparisons were an eye opener. The LX3's images were noticeably better.Below are quotes from the dpreview G10 review. I include them in my review of the camera because they closely echo my viewpoint:START QUOTE from dpreview:\"But the problems arise when the user gets back to a computer and downloads the images from the G10. In trying to keep ahead of the megapixel race, Canon has produced a camera that in the real world can't deliver on the promise of the styling and control layout. In the studio it produced some incredible results at base ISO, but out in the real world and as ISO settings increased, the loss of fine detail and increase in noise really let it down. A camera is ultimately about taking pictures, and that is why we put so much emphasis on the image quality output.Considering the wider market, with pressures coming from the cheaper LX3, and with low end digital SLRs getting cheaper all the time, it is hard to see who the G10 audience will be. Mainly those who own higher end DSLRs (especially Canon ones) looking for a compact second camera? Perhaps, but these users would certainly be discriminating about image quality, and the G10 might not live up to their expectations. So the G10 is in the 'flawed gem' category that, while great fun to take pictures with, is surpassed in image quality by other cameras in the same price range, and the same market segment. At its price the G10 just cannot overcome the image quality shortfalls to achieve our highest rating.The G10 leaves that lingering question. Just how good could this camera have been, had Canon taken a more conservative approach to resolution and put as much effort into optimising image quality as it did into making such an impressive camera body?\" END QUOTEMy feelings about the G10's noise problem have ranged from denial, to excuses, and now, after having viewed hundreds of noise-contaminated images, to disgust. Canon's decision to increase the G10s sensor resolution to 15 mega pixels has ruined what could have been a fabulous camera.UPDATE January 1, 2009: To add insult to injury, the G9 is currently selling on Amazon for $499 and G10 is currently selling for $412.

It cost nearly as much as the G10 with 1/7th the megapixels and has a much smaller zoom range. Over the years, I have added a G5 and a couple of EOS digitals, both used for my magazine work. However, as with my film days (daze?), I kinda always like to have a camera with me. That \"always with me\" camera was a Leica M - simply as good a picture taking tool as money could buy (in the film days). But in the digital age, the G10 has become that camera and (alas) the Leicas are in a camera bag in the closet.The camera has few vices. It has minimal shutter lag (as long as you are not shooting a lot of flash pictures since it takes a few seconds to charge things up), sports a useful zoom range (I like the fact that it's about a 28MM on the wide end) and the image quality is really quite wonderful. Good, sharp lens, images with excellent color.A fully charged battery easily lasts through a whole day of shooting - longer if you use an external flash. I also love the fact that the lens retracts and has a built in lens cover (unlike the G5 which has the patented \"easy to lose\" lens cap).I have not had to crack the manual very often which means it is quite simple to operate (although it has so many features, I'm probably missing something cool).I use it mostly as a backup - just in case camera - and for pictures at car club events where it really shines since it sits in my \"Think Tank\" hip case ready for anything. The pictures look great in the club magazine.Also, because it produces huge RAW files, I plan to use it for more professional assignments - should be interesting to see if the art director sees any difference from my SLR shots.I think the G10 is the current sweet spot for point and shoot cameras and given the small size of the chip in a these portable camera, this may be the high water mark for megapixel count too. I highly recommend the G10 to anyone who wants to own one \"good\" camera or to a pro who likes to always have a camera handy or a good back-up in the bag.One caution, at high ISO settings, the \"noise\" makes itself known - especially in scenes with a lot of sky.

The knobs offer quick access for frequently used settings without endless button pushing and menu drilling.  The form factor is great.  Others have complained about the weight and size, however, I love it.  It gives the camera a nice sturdy feel in my hand.  Best of all, I wanted DSLR performance in something that I would be willing to lug around an amusement park all day.  This fits the bill just fine.  Is it an Elph? No, but if you want a subcompact p&s;, go buy one.  This is geared more towards people who want advanced features in a reasonable size, without going fully DSLR.  The rear LCD is razor sharp.  Focusing is fast and acurate.  I haven't experienced any missed shots due to focusing issues.  I read complaints of poor low light performance, however I got excellent results shooting low light.  I might post some samples later.  And normal lighting shots are amazing.  Details are sharp, colors nice and crisp, and contrast is perfect.  My only complaints are with the unnecessary pixel increase and lack of zoom. I also had a dead pixel on my first G10.  From my understanding, the dead pixel issue is more common than I am comfortable with.  At 14mp, the shots can look a little noisy when displayed at full resolution.  It's a good size for editing, but I may jack the resolution down to a less noisy size.05/03/09 Update:Well, I returned the G10. The shots were good, however I felt the amount of noise was simply unacceptable for a high-end point and shoot of this caliber.  I eventually purchased a Canon SD880 Elph instead (I know... I'm laughing myself at the irony of my statement above and subsequent purchase of an Elph).  However, the biggest surprise is that the image quality of the Elph seems much better than the G10.  At full resolution, there is significantly less noise in shots taken with the SD880.  I really wanted to like/keep the G10, and believe me, I tried everything to compensate for the noise.  But in the end, image quality is the most important factor of a digicam; and the G10 just doesn't cut it as the supposed flagship of the Canon P&S; line, especially for the price.

What a service!When I shopped for a point and shoot last Xmas I was looking for a form factor and boy it was a mistake. I bought a Lumix 10M pixel camera that even today I will not spend fifty bucks for it. That was a lesson learn.What I like about this G10 is that now I can carry it every day to work and it takes great picture. Small enough to lug around and cheap enough to hide under a seat and let bang around in the car. I shoot mostly in the auto mode since most of my shots are candid and spontaneous. I own many canon pro L series lenses and a body so I got use to very good quality photos. This camera delivers consistent exposure though I think its red color spectrum is over saturated. It has plenty of shooting modes and manual controls that are very handy for pro-amateur users who have time to play with it. Its big live view screen is very handy especially when you do manual exposure. It came with a photo editor/import program that is smart enough to categorize photos on the day it was shot.What I don't like about this camera is that it is very slow. If you are expecting that multi bursts like a DSLR can do then forget it. when shooting a movie you can zoom in or out but its autofocusing does not work and that mean totally ruin your movie. Of course that mean you zoom with your legs for it to work. and then the white vertical streak band on the left or right hand side of screen when you shoot a movie and if your camera is facing the sun light couple degree off. In the normal shot it also show but it will a be reddish glow like lens flare in final image. In the movie however it what you see is what you get.Aside from those annoying flaws I still think it is worth the money for a camera that takes great picture in any kind of lightings.

I took a few movies and a bunch of nice snapshots.  I am very happy with the camera.  All that said, I gave this gadget a 4 instead of a 5 for a particular reason.  Canon apparently decided to move away from the Windows format movies for some reason.  So the movies are all Quicktime movies (*.MOV).  Since the majority of the population uses Windows based products, I find this highly aggravating.  I know that Apple is popular, but I would have prefered to see an option to use Quicktime or Windows Media Player options rather than moving completely away from the Windows environment.  I have Quicktime on my Windows systems.  So I can convert the movies manually, but that is a pain...and recently I noticed that I've been loosing quality in the transfer.

I guess as a point and shoot camera it is probably above average but it comes nowhere close to a digital SLR.  The G10 is fairly heavy and large, which I consider as an advantage. External controls for exposure control are easy to operate, playback and menu options are plentiful and very elaborate (although I would call myself technically literate, I had to read the manual several times). Picture quality looks good to me, the high mega pixel count allows for some cropping without loosing too much quality. Battery life time is good for some 300 shots with extensive flash use and playback reviews.  Even my four year old digital SLR has much less noise in the higher ISO range but then .. you can turn it into a creative composition. Exact zooming is a joke, the zoom button over- and under-shoots quite a bit, it is easier to step forward and back a few yards. The view finder maybe shows 80% of the actual photo, very disappointing, I almost never use the view finder. The large display works well, albeit very noisy as soon as the ambient light disappears. Good playback options, surprisingly there is no RGB histogram.  Almost as expected, most of the times there is a significant shutter delay, autofocus is slow. Any kind of action or fast portrait photography is challenging. For a camera of this size I was hoping to have a fast 2.8 lens across the whole zoom range (even at the price of a larger, more heavy and expensive camera. Ideally at a zoom range of 20-80mm). The aperture closes quickly to 4.5 or 5.6, basically placing everything into (boring) focus.  I still like the camera and since I carry it always with me, I find myself taking a lot more photos than with a digital SLR with some large 2.8 zoom lens. The 16:9 option is a nice addition, interval shooting would have been a nice add-on as well. It seems that cameras in this price range have a lot of gimmicks, face recognition, anti-shake,  but kinda distracting from focusing on a good composition and a small tripod. I have the controls pretty much locked at Av, f2.8, center weighted, 16:9 and fill flash.

The were very crisp, and when set to \"Vivid\" mode they were perfectly saturated and gorgeous on my 50\" plasma HDTV.  Unfortunately, the shots I took at night, in dim light, and indoors were a different story.  They were all plagued by noise, or strange smeared looking detail-less photos because of the extreme digital noise reduction that takes place inside the camera.  In less than optimal lighting the camera tries to compensate for the high amount of noise brought on by too many pixels packed into a tiny point and shoot sensor on longer exposures by using DNR right when you shoot.Another huge flaw for me was the lack of ability to shoot HD video.  Last years model had this feature, why remove it now in a time when HDTVs are now more popular and affordable ever!  On top of that the video format used in the G10 is a horrible .mov apple format that won't work with Windows Movie Marker, one of the most easy to use and not to mention free programs around.  Before, I was able to pop my SD card out of my camera, and into my PS3 and watch the movies I took on my HDTV instantly.  Now with the G10 my PS3 doesn't even play the video format, and the PS3 supports nearly ever popular video file(avi, WMV, mpeg2, mpeg4).  So that sucked for me big time because my other three Canon cameras do just fine, with a much more popular .avi video file.The G10 was going for $455 a few weeks ago(12/10/2008), and now can be had for $375 on sale if you watch the prices enough... looks like the word is getting out.  As a matter of fact, it's more expensive to purchase last years G9 model new.  That's saying something.  Hopefully these camera companies will stop the megapixel race or buff up their sensors.  In the mean time I recommend you either get a much cheaper regular point and shoot like the Canon SD 790, or a true entry level DSLR like the Nikkon D40.Also to note, my camera shipped with a slight lens error, and I sent it back for a replacement through Amazon's excellent customer service, and that worked fine.

Haven't had any shots, still or movies, that didn't turn out with excellent quality. Set it on auto and you're ready to go. There are only three thing I would change on this camera. The first is that a bright light comes on shooting at the subject, which I assume is the focus light. When trying to get candid shots with a 2 year old, it distracts them and you don't get the candid shot you wanted. The second thing I would change is Canon has a wheel on the back of the camera to change your settings. In the movie mode, I have bumped that wheel about a dozen times and it changes the color of the video to something other than natural. Why they even have that feature is belong me but it should be put in a place where you can't accidently hit it. Finally, the camera will not allow you to zoom in when taking movies. You have to do your zoom first and then start taking the movie. That's great if you are not chasing a two year old around the park.

Both, the original new G10 that I bought straight from Amazon, AND it's new replacement, had specs of white fuzz under the enclosed lens! I'm guessing Canon is getting hit hard by the \"global financial crisis\" too and decided that clean rooms were over-rated! Sorry to sound so negative, but paying this much for \"the best,\" you'd expect great quality control! Anyway, the first camera I received had a large piece of white dust easily visible to the unaided eye, though it happened to be on the outer edge of the focal area. It never seemed to be noticeable in average photos, but I would get an artifact from sun glaring photos that seemed to originate from that area of the lens, so to be safe, I returned it to get it replaced. The second unit had a much smaller piece of fuzz, but at this time I just needed a camera and gave up on the frustration of getting even another questionable unit. Last complaint is the eyepiece, even though I never use it, I was dismayed to find out how easily ambient dust finds it's way into the eyepiece aperture. Even though we always keep the camera in a bag, it somehow gets dust under the eyepiece. I'm guessing it sneaks in through the focusing dial? I frankly don't care since I doubt I will ever use the eyepiece, but hey, maybe this is bad news for some other people. I must say, putting all this aside, the body is solid, I like its feel!Features: Fast, I love how I almost dropped the camera when I first turned it on; the lens speed open so fast I lost my grip, then I grabbed the camera to get a better hold of it, then accidentally hit the camera button and took a photo, in what all seemed to be a millisecond... WOW that was fast! I also must say... more buttons is very good! This unit is awesome, since it has so many easy to get to buttons right on the device, less fishing through countless dialogs to get what you want. But now that Canon focused on making a camera with more buttons, one can still complain that their is still not enough! I could bore you with a list, but I just have to give them credit for such a nice camera. Probably my only complaint is that some modes don't save adjusted settings, like auto mode for instance... if you say \"no flash,\" but then switch to a manual mode, then come back, you lost your \"no flash\" setting. But oddly other settings are sometimes kept in the manual modes.... weird! This is where an additional button for using stored or default settings would be nice. LOLPicture Quality: had trouble viewing canon RAW format in Linux. Some reason three different interpreters distorted the coloring and made the photos unusable. Maybe Canon changed their format since the G10, and Linux community hasn't kept up? Quality of photos, not too shabby, but like other people, I wish they would drop the megapixel race and focus on ISO quality! Megapixels are no match for lousy dark photo shots!Video mode: the video camera... ugh, drives me crazy when you buy a camera only to find out optical zoom is turned off when in video mode. Funny, some cameras get bad reviews because the zoom motor makes noise in the microphone when people use it, so they complain about it. Canon must have taken note of this and decided to turn the feature off, but to those who complain about the noise, DON'T USE THE ZOOM then, or just use digital zoom instead! Geesh, bad marketing scheme for Canon, VERY bad! Otherwise, camera is very good. I like how it seems that stabilization is linear rather than logarithmic. Some cameras' stabilization is jerky and unnatural, and if you take off the stabilization, all you see is shake shake shake. This camera's stabilization is built in and is smooth. It has a VERY slight \"swing\" or \"rubber band\" effect to it, but a much more natural one! You probably wouldn't even notice it, but it helps greatly. You can still get a shake in the recording, but it is nothing like other cameras! VERY NICE!Firmware: this is the first Canon I have ever owned, and I must say, I find the menu system has a very large learning curve to get used to it! I think once in a while companies should leave bad ideas and move to more useful ones, but I don't blame them for trying to adopt and maintain a menu standard to make it easier for previous Canon users. Good approach, but I dread to find out where they might place the next 20 features that come out in their next model, maybe another button? That would be nice! :)Battery life: not too bad... as expected, one can always wish for more life, nothing new here!Hope this helped!", "Date": "February 3, 2009"}, {"Title": "It's ok.", "Author": "Jonathan \"dewalt99\"", "ReviewID": "R3B642GQZ2I5NG", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "This G10 is an upgrade to the G9 I previously owned.

Not a problem wasn't in  hurry anyway. Once in hand camera seemed very solid. I had read all the reviews from amazon and elsewhere, and even considered getting the Nikon P6000 in its stead. One issues arose immediately, a light banding issue in the LCD. Whenever I pointed the camera in the direction of a light source (ie. a energy saving light bulb hanging from the ceiling and its reflection in a mirror) perfect solid bands of light would streak across the LCD screen emanating from the lights. I contacted Canon and they seemed baffled by this. They suggested that it might have been firmly jostled during shipping and affected the processor. If I sent it to them I was looking at a two week turn around, or I could just send it back to the shipper as defective, which I ultimately did. .....TO BE CONTINUED(Purchased on 01/16/2009)I received a another G10 because the first was thought defective. Now, this new camera had the same light banding issue, and this time it also had a few dead pixels on the LCD. I could not believe my luck. The dead pixels was a no brainer this camera was going back too. However, in all the reviews I had read, I had not come across one regarding the light banding issue. So, I sent this camera back. I did replace the order. I have since received yet another G10.  I also purchased two 16gb SD cards a PQI and a Transcend. I had also purchased two extra batteries, so I was committed to make this work.[As a side note, each 16gb card can take up to 2450 shots on superfine mode @ 15MP, 3984 @ 9M, 6126 @ 5M, 9999 @ 2M and web size, 3267 @ WS, and 756 using RAW. If you set RAW+JPG you only get 636, this is the setting I use mostly.]So with three batteries [400 shots per battery] I am supposedly good for up to 1200 shots. Can't comment on video, because I have not really delved into it.(Purchased on 02/02/2009)Finally, received my third attempt at purchasing this camera. As I said before I am committed to making this work. Review after review insists that this camera is unparalleled in its class, and I am a Nikon leaning personality. Anywho, my third attempt. Camera in hand. LCD screen is perfect. No issues with either memory card. I point towards a light source, stare at the LCD. Light banding issue?YES. as it turns out it happens no matter what type of light I point towards.Although it shows in the LCD it does not translate to the actual pic. So, LCD- Yes, photo- No. Overall the camera seems to be a very decent choice. I bought it to take pictures you might take with a good DSLR but not have to carry one. Something to fit in the pocket. I am barely a photo enthusiast, but like to have quality and the ability to achieve more than my initial intentions. Who knows, might actually take this more seriously in the future as a hobby. Most of the shots I have taken are marco, and I have to say I am impressed. I do not regret the choice, for the most part I am satisfied with the G10.** I'm told that all CCD cameras have this issue when pointed at a light source. However, my Sony HD camcorder does not, but then too that is has CMOS. Also my iPhone does not either.Only real knock about the camera besides, not the best thing for capturing moving objects.

Amazon just omits things that do not suit them.Digital Photography Review was NOT overwhelmed by the G10's performance. Perhaps because using ISOs over 200 results in too much noise. Perhaps because subjects with less than great contrast tend to produce softer images.  Maybe because using f/stop numbers higher than 5 tend to soften images a bit because of \"diffraction.\"  I also own a Canon G6 (7 MP). It has a \"pixel density\" of 19 MP/cm2.  The G10 has a whopping pixel density of 34 MP/cm2.  My old Canon 5D DSLR has a pixel density of 1.5 MP/cm2.  As you may know, high pixel density is a detriment to capturing great images.I purchased the G10 as a \"grab-and-go-backup\" for when I didn't feel like \"shlepping\" all of my DSLR gear ... I also purchased (and reviewed on Amazon) the nice Canon A650 IS.The bottom line is that VERY FEW compact digital cameras will produce images even close to DSLRs - your grab-and-go image will ALMOST ALWAYS be imperfect if you are a stickler.SO, why take any small camera with you that will produce lesser images- you'll smack your forehead and say \"I could have taken my DSLR!\" just like in the V8 commercial. BUT, if you simply MUST take a small camera, why not take a small camera that costs less than the G10?  Like the Canon A650 IS, still findable on the internet for less than on Amazon.Yes the G10 has some very ergonomic controls and is flexible,although it is not \"pocketable.\"Yes it has a very nice LCD screen. And if all you've ever taken pictures with are Canon's Elph digicams,  the G10 will be a big step up.If all you take are images that will be 6 x 4 inch prints, this G10 camera will do the job (though you can get cheaper and LIGHTERdigicams to do that job). Even 8 x 10s will be OK much of the time with the G10. With a tripod, even larger prints are do-ablewith reasonable quality.I have a big bunch blue ribbons for photography from camera clubs, juried exhibitions (and sales), and galleries.Only ONE of all of those blue ribbons was awarded to me for animage that came came from a compact digicam. That ONE came from the Canon G6.SO, as far as the G10 being a REAL DSLR backup? .... maybe not so much. Given the choice, you'll always take the DSLR if the image quality matters to you.

This looks like a wonderful camera, except (1) Canon has fallen prey to the Megapixel Marketing Myth, and (2) the proprietary $70 battery pack.I get superb poster-size blowups from my 7 megapixel Canon S710.  And I can carry around cheap rechargeable AA batteries, or pick up Duracells at any newsstand or grocery store in a pinch.  But I covet some of the G-series features (flash hotshoe, metal body, SLR-like exposure dial, etc.).I'd love to see Canon build a camera in the G10 form factor with AA batteries and a better (lower-pixel, lower-noise) sensor chip.", "Date": "December 28, 2008"}, {"Title": "The G10 is a Canon blunder--here's why", "Author": "C. West \"Shoot 2 Create\"", "ReviewID": "R3Q7Y4YBF9GI5V", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I have many Canon cameras--35mm film and DSLR models. I bought the G10 to give to someone. However, I soon learned that this model is flawed. It's a great camera for shots in perfect outdoor light situations, but when the ISO increases the images are the worst pixilated images I've seen. For example, at ISO 400 and minus 1 stop exposure, even RAW images aren't recoverable. At ISO 200 you'll have to work in Photoshop to get a good image.Generally, photographers consider that the small sensors used in P&S; cameras barely make the grade--they can't handle low-light and the on camera flash is an out of control light-source. The G10 goes a long way to prove how bad it can get with a P&S.;That said, the reason I purchased the G10 from Amazon is because of their no-hassle refund and I'm glad I did in this case.", "Date": "November 23, 2008"}, {"Title": "HORRIBLE LOW LIGHT CAMERA!!!!!!!!!!!!!", "Author": "Objective analysis", "ReviewID": "R73LAWOGLDPST", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "DOES NOT LIVE UP TO HYPE AT ALL...so far.THIS IS A GREAT CAMERA... IF YOUR FAMILY VACATION PLANS ARE A TRIP TO THE CENTER OF THE SUN.......other than that it is a very very noisy low light camera.So I agree with the other reviewer, if you are a bright light outside type, then get it,..... no problems there...nice!!!If you bought into the low light DITCH-IT 4 processor hype, then it is a real let down.My old 1 megapixel powershot (8 years old) did just as well, in the low light noise area...with zero image stabilization.I will do some more tests, but so far this camera is a major let down.Requires a lot of light, and looks like it has the RAW measles above ISO 200.Honest, wait for more reviews to come in, by the way, I have a Rebel, an XTI, and an XSI as well. Also 4 other Canon Digitals, I am (was) a Canon fan, and thought this would be a breakthrough product...but it wasnt.Simply cannot deliver on the hype.Unless someone can get a better handle on the low light noise settings, it wouldnt take a Nostradamus to predict this camera will get yanked faster than the G9.As usual if you try to compesate with one board flash, it has the Frankensteins lighted lightning labratory garish effect.I dont really shoot JPEGS much so I dont know about those yet.Pretty much shoot raw. XSI was less noisy in raw mode.I really had hoped this would be the first practical digital do all art museum camera. I will try some more tests at the Detroit Art Institute on all types of light and media, but for now any hopes I might have had are shattered.If you do have good indoor lighting at ISO 100 and 200 under good  light the color is wonderful very nice pictures. In most museums  they wont let you use flash, same with other artsy places. Wide angle is nice great museum camera from that perspective......but low light and Image stabilization are a must.....", "Date": "October 8, 2008"}, {"Title": "use it for a while and the problems appear", "Author": "John Frisbie", "ReviewID": "R3GHZD235G7WO6", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "dust gets on the sensor and in the lens casing very quickly. don't take it anywhere the wind is blowing. and don't count on canon to repair it. not a problem with one, but many of these cameras. takes great pix though.", "Date": "July 14, 2009"}, {"Title": "Luke Warm", "Author": "Serge Neri", "ReviewID": "RT3VLMAQ4DQ1V", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "This camera is awesome for what it is supposed to be; a compact camera with lots of power and versatility.

It's idiot proof (my GF took it to france and did ok!) I just bought the underwater housing and that is gonna be so awesome.My D300 is a lot better but i've been using it a lot less lately.  I Try to keep the ISO on 80. It is noisy but high ISO pics i turn blk and white and they look great. Seriously its no big deal. Also i picked this over the lumix because the controls are easy to reach, really easy!I gave it 1 star just to piss people off and to get attention on my review. =b (Haters feel free to hate.)
