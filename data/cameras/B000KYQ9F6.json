I was drawn to its looks initially, but didn't want to get stuck with a lemon just because it was a pretty color. After lots of research, I decided to try it out.The first pictures that I took with it were of some farm land right at dusk with the sun already behind a mountain. I used the \"Night\" mode and the pictures looked as though we were there in bright daylight! Even distant items stood out with great color and clarity.It also has modes for portraits, children, sunsets, and so much more! I still can't believe how many features this camera has for the money.The only thing that it lacks is a strong zoom, but, face it: that's what runs the price up on a lot of cameras. This camera gives you a whole lot of features at about half the price of other 7mp cameras.THIS IS THE BEST ELECTRONICS PURCHASE I HAVE EVER MADE!!!!", "Date": "April 6, 2007"}, {"Title": "3 months and still going strong!", "Author": "Mystie \"Mystie\"", "ReviewID": "R139Y08QHMDLI5", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I bought this camera 3 months ago and I'm still AMAZED by it. The video is takes is fantastic, and the pictures come out absolutely AMAZING. I never have to adjust the flash or anything, it just focuses and does all the work. The LCD display is big and displays the photos perfectly, you can even zoom in to get a closer look. I've never been so happy with an electronics purchase.", "Date": "March 11, 2007"}, {"Title": "Best Birthday", "Author": "N.

It has great and numerous fairly easy to use features and it has video.  It also has music on it (I think you can download music of your choice onto it-gotta look that up) that will play during your slide shows.  The batteries run out really quickly though so you are better off getting rechargables as soon as you can.  I spent a day researching digital cams in our price range and this cute little number is a lot of camera for a little money!", "Date": "July 30, 2007"}, {"Title": "Polaroid Doesn't Stand Behind It's Products", "Author": "W. Heinbokel", "ReviewID": "R34PGIAQQP7ZTY", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "My daughter received the i733lp as a Christmas present and was very excited to own her own digital camera.  This camera performed well initially only to have the LCD screen unexpectantly go blank.  Since the camera does not have a view finder, the camera is unusable should the LCD screen fail.  As the camera was only a few months old, we contacted Polaroid to have the camera repaired under warranty.  After incurring the cost of shipping the camera to the designated repair site, we were contacted by Polaroid and told that the warranty doesn't cover the LCD screen.  How can that be?  I reiterate, the camera is  unusable without an operational LCD screen.I have owned several digital cameras manufactured by Nikon and Canon and have never experienced any problems with their products.  You have many many choices available when picking a point and shoot digital camera.  Don't focus solely on the performance of the camera when making your choice.  It is just as important to know that the manufacturer will stand behind their product should problems come up.  It is for this reason that I implore you to not waste your hard earned money on a product manufactured by Polaroid.", "Date": "September 4, 2008"}, {"Title": "Polaroid 7MP DC Pink", "Author": "Cara \"Mom X2\"", "ReviewID": "RB7XNM953QVWJ", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Polaroid 7MP Dc Pink We bought this camera as a birthday gift for our 20 yr. old daughter.

The color of the camera is bright and cute and it was easy to navigate through the photo options. However there were some cons about this camera. The photo shutter would get stuck quite a bit. It also has an annoying double flash that makes everyone that you are photographing wonder if you finished taking the picture or should they still continue to pose. Real akward. Also, if you are trying to take a photo of any moving object it is a waste. My camera finally died the other day because that shutter that malfunctioned so many times before finally jammed for good. I looked at some reviews for this camera on another site and many users had the same issue. This time I am going to shop for a more light weight camera and one that doesnt have the annoying flash and shutter issues.", "Date": "December 27, 2008"}, {"Title": "Great camera... when it works.", "Author": "Jeremy Epstein", "ReviewID": "R13KUHW1V9I8QY", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "Bought one for my ten year old.

However it does the annoying double flash, pictures turn out way too washed out and bright no matter what and it is a battery sucker....and it is a little heavy for my taste, kinda bulky.Pros....it has a rubberized outer shell, if you drop it no biggie and if it floats around your bag..no scratches.only pro about the rubberized-ness is that I had the camera in a new leather bag with black lining and the color transfered on to the camera, I have no idea how to get it off.I am upgrading once again and hopefully for the last time to a Nikon and giving this to my 5yr old.", "Date": "November 25, 2008"}, {"Title": "Absoulte CRAP", "Author": "AJ", "ReviewID": "R2KR621RDS0SOC", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "It is a refurbished and knew that going in.

I had a old digital camera. Pretty simple, like this one. Got dropped in too many rivers and streams on fishing trips and finally died, so I got this one. My only complaint so far is that you have to hold the ON button for longer than you should. In my opinion.Basically, all the digital cameras I looked at were expensive. This one seemed close to our old one. My daughter likes pink. And it was \"refurbished\" or whatever, so it was about 15 bucks. If they had sold it as new, I wouldn't have batted an eye.
