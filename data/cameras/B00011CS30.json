{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Impressiv specs, still .....", "Author": "Oliver Wolter \"Oliver Wolter\"", "ReviewID": "R1UBGY4ABPMPQR", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "This is a top of the line point'n shoot camera. Without any doubt the 12x optical zoom with image stabilizing and fast 2.8f aperture along the whole zoom range of 35-420 mm (35mm equiv.) are the icing on the cake. Nevertheless I'm slightly dissapointed about this camera because the specs read like my dream camera and the engineers from Panasonic just couldn't keep it together. Why? - I will cover this later.I was so anxious about getting my set together that I bought a bag first going by the size of the FZ1 - big mistake. The FZ10 is about double the size. Definitly no camera to slip in your pocket. Battery are pretty expensive, about 50$ a piece. A good replacement, not from Panasonic but way cheaper and even higher in the mAh rating is AC-CGAS002 (the barn were you get `em from is great). Charge and running time equal almost 1hr.The Tripod adapter blocks access to the battery and memory compartment.  In dcresource the macro is described to work only in the automatic macro mode. So you couldn`t go by your own settings (manual). Good news - not true-. What is also not described in the manual, the camera does the same macro in manual mode. Literally up to the lense, almost touching it, with super sharp images. Personally, I do prefer the manual mode for several reasons and this is where my dissapointment starts. In a dim light situation, still enough to take a decent picture, the LCD is pitch black. It is not broken, that's just the way it is. The techs from Panasonic told me something about achery techniques and how to shoot over the body. I call it a \"Misconception\". Also the brightness of the flash is not displayed, saying the LCD should get brighter when flash is activated. Still you get nice pictures - with dim light focusing slightly advanced to some other digital pointers- just you don't see the composition and focusing. I consider this the major drawback of this camera. Surprisingly enough though, if you switch to Automatic mode the LCD display in the very same dim light situation with exactly the same setting, is fine. Aperture- or Shutter priority are also good in this respect.  I say it again, this applies  only to dim light situations in manual mode. In standard light situations you won't notice.Talking about low light situations, the flash is quite impressiv. Gives you also the option to compensate (-2/+2). This is very helpful if you don't wanna compensate the flash by shutter/aperture.Lense cap has no string to hold it to the body - risk of losing it. I am an avid Photoshop user. So I like the auto braket function to take 3 consecutive shots with different esposures for different layers in the software. Still after every shot you have to kick the bracket in again. There is no button to enable this function permanently like cameras for only a fraction of the price do. I wouldn't mind that if it were not so long winded to get to that function. Between changing the shutter/aperture in Manual mode, engaging the bracket to -1/+1 and back again, it is necessary to push 9 buttons. (Wanna count? exposure/dial up/3x dial right/3xdial up/exposure.) And this after every shot, huhhh.Most people won't mind, but it takes only jpeg format. No non-compression formats available. This camera lets me take considerably more pictures (about 165) with 256mb than my Dimage s414 (about 125), which also happens to be a  4 MP camera - each camera in the best jpeg settings. With best settings this camera takes file sizes wich average about 1,5MB (Dimage S414 about 2MB). OK not every manufacture uses compression to the same extend, and in this setting Panasonic has surely found a nice compromise between quality and compression. Still I would be happier if Panasonic had tweaked its compession less aggressively, in order to achieve higher quality (but lager file size).  Expecially since non-compression is missing and this camera is supposingly more oriented towards the prosumer section.Nevertheless the picture quality is superb across the whole zoom range (the lense seems to make up for it).I read reviews were people complained about noise. I figure they chose the wrong ISO (Auto ISO?). Try to use 100, 50 if possible. Everything from ISO 200 on gets indeed noisy, so is it with other cameras. And the fast lense 2.8f over the whole zoom range together with the Image Stabilizer give you quite some options here.The image stabilizer works great. I think this feature should become as much of an standard as it is for camcorders. This from Panasonic should  be a wake up call for the other manufactures to install it in there ultrazooms.Very positive is the overall speed of the camera. SD memory might help it. Run-up, Burst mode and time between shots is very fast. High Burst gets you 4-5 shots in 2sec.  After that you are ready again after about 4 sec. I consider this to be very fast. The only issue in the Burst mode is that it freezes the picture in the LCD screen. Burst makes sense for moving objects. And that is were you find it almost impossible to keep your object in focus when you just see a series of taken pictures with a delay of about 0.5 seconds. The purple fringing, which often comes along with extreme zoom lenses seems to be moderate. I haven't seen any so far with taken lots of pictures in situations where this is supposed to be most present, like against the sun with darker objects in front. Still it is mentioned in some of the reviews. Verdict: Even thought I wrote critically this shouldn`t distract from the fact that this is a state of the art point'n shoot camera with a great Leica lense and a stabilazation system you won't find in any other model of this category.So giving away some of my high expectations this is still an excellent camera which will epeal to the advanced photographer with a need for an extreme zoom.", "Date": "January 6, 2004"}, {"Title": "Great Prosumer camera!", "Author": "G. Pierce", "ReviewID": "RDQGJ7SN5KYNQ", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Lumix DMC-FZ10S4Mpel, 12x optical zoom, non-pocket camera, $550ishWow! Finally an affordable camera with MORE features, functions and image quality than my old 35mm SLR camera. At about $550 this has to be the best semi-pro camera around. The specs are impressive, but the ease of use brings the full potential to your fingertips. While it can take great pictures as a point-and-click camera - easily beating the Canon G3-G5 - the real power comes when you begin going manual.Conventional wisdom holds that you should buy a digital camera from an established film camera company. Well, this camera combines the excellence of a lens/camera company - Leica - with a great Electronics Company - Panasonic - the best of both worlds!For a sound byte: The Lumix takes GREAT pictures! The lens is an incredible 12x optical zoom (equivalent to 35-420mm 35mm) that works well at both ends of the range (yes it does have a bit of chromatic aberration at full zoom, but only at a 200% blow-up on the screen). The macro works down to a few inches! The lens is rather fast for the zoom - f2.8 and the equivalent ASA is 50 to 400. So a good lens, a good sensor, then comes the really great part: the electronics.It has a very low shutter lag, fabulous MANUAL focus (beating all the SLR's that I have seen!), Image stabilization that makes the handheld 12x optical work (don't try handheld at 1/30sec full zoom, but hey what do you expect for a 420mm lens??), a delay timer for both tripod/handheld AND run-and-get-in-the picture, fast multishot, exposure bracketing, a red eye reduction that works, full 30fps movie mode, great review functions on camera and everything in the viewfinder - for those of us needing reading glasses, this is a dream! I could go into detail on all the features, but that is just an owner's manual read. It works and easy to control, at least for a right hander (I'm guessing it would be a pain for a leftie.)I wish they had more controls on the compression - less compression would be nice since in low light the compression artifacts do show up. The 4MPEL image sensor really seems to be a good capture device.Bottom Line: For a serious amateur, this is a great camera. For a pro, this might take the place of many SLR's. An real amateur can go all automatic and get great pictures and have room to move to better pictures with manual later. It doesn't fit in your pocket, but it takes great pictures!JerryThis is the fifth digital camera I have owned. I replaced my Canon IS90 with the Lumix and am pleased I did. I still look longingly at the Nikon D100 6MP and the Canon EOS-10D, but I can't justify the difference in price to compare to the Lumix.", "Date": "February 16, 2004"}, {"Title": "i've give this camera 8 starts if it was possible.", "Author": "M.

I have been researching what camera to buy for the last few months! and I haven't found a camera that comes close to this one.First of all the camera is big, so if you want a small zoom camera this isn't it. I'd recommend the Panasonic DMC fz1 or the Olympus C-750 models.This camera comes the closest to perfect for me and what i've wanted in a camera.Pros:(1) leica lens (fyi leica makes $2000 cameras, so for this camera to have a leica lens, it's got to be good).(2) the camera has auto and manual focus, and auto and manual modes so u can either point and shoot or learn to take pix with the more advanced features.(3) movie mode is very descent and it has good sound.(4) has a 16:9 ratio for 1 photo size (quality) setting, so u can take a pic and it'll be in widescreen...cool huh?(5) all the modes on the dial, portrait, night portrait, panning (makes a moving object in sharp while the background is blurry), sports, macro.(6) battery life is good. lasts pretty much all day.(7) has this cool flip animation, you can make movies with ur clay figurines, if you'd like!! take a pic of a figurine and move it slightly every time and when done itll convert it into a quicktime movie.(8) of course, the super ultra yummy zoom! how could i forget that? that's what got me interested in the camera in the first place.(9) aperture range of the lens is f2.8 throughout the focul range from wide to telephoto.(10) menus are easy to navigate and quick.(11) can use conversion lenses for wide and tele.(12) burst mode, can take 4-5 pics quick.(13) histogram on play and record mode - good for composition measuring.(14) turns on in about 2-3 secs after getting lens ready.(15) great photo quality!!! which is the most important thing!!(16) creativity for pictures!!!Now for cons:(1) of course, price.......but ah well...shouldn't be a con, nice things cost money!(2) i found that you cannot thread filters to the lens (lens not threaded) so can't protect lens with a (for example a UV filter to leave on permanently.) But can thread filters (72mm) to the lens hood (the camera package includes) which attaches to the lens barrel, (lens hood) roughtly 2-3 inches wide.(3) and the movie mode.....cant use the zoom!!!! wonder why!?!(4) extra batteries are expensive, and hard to find at ur local store.despite these 4 cons i have found in the last 3 months of researching for the perfect zoom camera, this has gotten to the closest i've found.Also, get a SD card at least 256megs or larger and start shooting away!!!!", "Date": "April 17, 2004"}, {"Title": "Underpriced gem", "Author": "Mr. S. De Witt \"eviledna\"", "ReviewID": "R2UGDC3MOOXHNN", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I finally decided to take the plunge into digital cameras after by two faithful Pentax's finally gave up the ghost.  I did a lot of research looking for a camera with the right combination of quality, features and price.  Having used other peoples point-and-shoot camera's I was disappointed with AF ability, and wanted to ensure I had a manual focus override - the FZ-10 has it.  I also do a lot of sports photography, so I needed a camera with shutter-priority - the FZ10 had it (in addition to aperture priority and fully manual options).  I also needed a camera with a reasonable f range, and the 2.8-8 available with this camera met my needs and seems better than most others.  Finally the 12x optical zoom with image stabilization means I no longer need to carry a bulky 400mm lens and tripod.I have only had the camera a week and already love it.  The color rendition is superb, the exposure bracketing works really well, the macro produces superbly sharp pictures, the image stabilisation really works and I have enlarged pictures up to 10x8 with no noticeably digitization.  In fact, I believe the quality of images I am getting are better than with my old film camera.  The spot-focus mode is tremendously useful for portrait work.  Of course I do have a few gripes.(a) The manual focus assist is not as good as the split-ring system on my old camera and I have now turned this off,(b) I would prefer to be able to go down to f/16 (and I will be buying a neutral density filter to overcome this problem),(c) it doesn't store images in raw format (only jpeg),(d) the supplied 16MB card is too small to be of any real use (but hell it's only there to get you going),(e) I would prefer to be able to use non-propietary batteries (but given the relatively modest cost of the camera I can live with this and buy a second battery)(f) The lens cap is not attached and I suspect I will lose it.Others complain about the fact that you can't access the SD card and battery if the camera is mounted on a tripod.  This is true, but I also found the need for a tripod much reduced.  I have not had a chance yet to try it out in low-light conditions, but I understand this can cause problems.", "Date": "May 3, 2004"}, {"Title": "What kind of camera is that?", "Author": "John Whitbread", "ReviewID": "R6MXBYTBA4IWB", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "\"What kind of camera is that?\" is the first thing everyone says to me when they see this camera. This is the only camera I have had that people immediately write down the model number to go get one for themselves. You can see from other reviews, the owners of this machine are smart people who have done their research. I have now sold several photos taken with this camera. It's lighter than it looks, it handles like my 35mm, it is easy to use right away and as I get better with it the images are getting better and better. We all send pics via email. The response is usually \"cool pic\" or similar. Now it is \"wow! what a great shot!\" The battery life is the best I have ever had. I can fill a 256mb card and the battery meter still shows full charge. The bad?

I have developed pictures from both cameras and there is no comparison.This camera truly outperformed all of my expectations.  There are many options to push your experience into the \"professional mode\" which I have not even tried yet.  I have not had this for a week and yet have many excellent pictures which I have shown off to friends and family.  One problem I have had with all cameras is trying to get good pictures of my ragdoll cats without red or irredescent eyes.  I captured their big blue eyes and did not even use the red eye reduction feature.  The flash angle is perfect to impart a professional quality to your photos.  It is true that the lens cap is not attached, but if anyone passes this camera for that reason they are truly missing out on a great opportunity.  I feel that my pictures compare with Canon T70 which I used for years.  If you research this camera at the digicam review sites, they all agree that it is an excellent buy.  One very important feature on this camera is the optical image stabilizer.  I took some existing light pics which should have been taken with a tripod and yet they were perfect because this camera stabilizes camera shake so well.  I expect to keep this camera for many years.  Don't let the 4.0 megapixel make you pass this up.  By adding the Leica lenses, the image quality is superb and may surpass many higher megapixel cameras.  I am looking forward to trying many of the added features soon.  I know I will not be disappointed.", "Date": "March 18, 2004"}, {"Title": "A great piece of engineering!", "Author": "Pranab Bhattarai", "ReviewID": "R3PUW4QH7N6NAL", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "When Panasonic released this camera in the fall of 2003, I couldn't wait for it to be available for sale. A couple of months passed and it was completely sold out even before it was available anywhere in the market. At that point, I couldn't wait and I contacted a Panasonic dealer and reserved one right away. I was on the waiting list for 2 more months and I finally got it in Jan 2004. A 12x stabilized optical zoom at that time was unheard of on a consumer camera. It was awesome! I could take pictures at full 12X without a tripod and the stabilizer made sure the pictures were perfect. For $599 it was the best digital camera out there. It has almost been a year since I bought this camera and I am still in love with it; but I wish I had waited. When Panasonic came out with the same camera but with a 5.0 mega pixels at the same price earlier this year, I was kicking myself for being so impulsive. Nevertheless, it is a great piece of engineering. The camera feels like a tank- very solid but not all that heavy at the same time. I have captured some of the most amazing pictures with this camera, which I will treasure for the rest of my life.If you don't really care about all the features and just want a small digital camera to carry around and snap pictures with, I wouldn't recommend this camera for you. This is more like a camera you would want to take to your trip to the Grand Canyon and capture the breath taking shots or the perfect sunset that you always wanted to capture and have it blown up. There are so many features in this camera, it will take a good couple of weeks for you to read the manual and get used to them.I am not going to list all the features this camera has; you can read about them on the product description page or you can go to the Panasonic homepage and get a more detailed description of all the cool features you can find in this camera. However, I do want to make a couple of points:This camera uses a Leica lens. For those of you who are not familiar with this brand, Leica Camera AG is a world-renowned German camera and lens maker. Just the name Leica, in the photography world, is synonymous with durability, quality, and optical precision. Leica makes lenses that cost thousands of dollars for high-end professional cameras so for Leica to feature its lens in this Panasonic camera tells it all.One thing a lot of people don't look at when they are buying a digital camera is if you can add additional lenses and filters like you can with a 35mm SLR. Although a 12X optical zoom (equivalent to a 36mm to 432mm in a 35mm camera) will be more than enough for most of us, some of us might want to add conversion or teleconversion lenses or filters and YES you can with this camera. Let me give you an example of what a 12X zoom can do: How many times have u been to a NFL or a baseball game and have taken pictures only to find out that you can't even make out what number jersey a player is wearing when u get the pictures? Well, with this camera, I have been talking pictures at games and let me tell you, they are just amazing! Besides all the close-up shots of all my favorite players, I could even capture those priceless facial expressions when someone makes a hit or at that moment when a receiver catches the ball for a touchdown.... it's truly amazing!You cannot go wrong with this camera!", "Date": "December 5, 2004"}, {"Title": "Serious Amateur", "Author": "S.

I am not a pro in photography, and have no real desire to get into the nitty gritty of apatures and all the tech stuff... but I care deeply about getting some great pictures. SO.. I deal as much as I have to with the technical. I especially love candid people shots, and do a lot of indoor photography in places where constant flash is undesirable, such as weddings and other church services.I discovered that what aids this the most is a big lens, stabilization and good zoom... which led me to this camera, and I was NOT disappointed.The larger lens has allowed me to get the most amazing indoor  with no flash pictures. Yes there are still limitations, and I still get a percentage of blurred photos, but not anywhere near as many as I use to. And the zoom!!!  I just returned from AZ where I took a river boat ride, and a flock of mountain sheep was spotted high on the canyon walls. I could barely see them with my naked eye.. could only really spot them from movement, but I zooming in fully, and kept clicking. Wow! I got the most amazing pictures. I've also gotten some great pictures taken from those tiny airplane windows as the plane is taking off and landing. Some great overviews of the San Francisco bay... and was able to zoom into some boats on the water even. The color is great!You ever try taking people pictures of people who don't like having their pictures taken... like family and friends? With this camera I turned off all sound, use no flash, and am able to zoom in easily from across the room, and I get the best family and friends candid pictures!  Also the best thing I did besides buying this camera was to get an extra battery, and buy a 1MB media card. I seldom run out of room or battery power (beyond this)even when I'm on an extended vacation. Even after 2 weeks in AZ, I just took my SD media card to WalMart and had it put onto a photo CD.. and cleared it for more pictures.  I only needed to do this once... and took over a thousand pics (total) on vacation!  All in all I'm now drooling over the newer and improved models of the same camera!!Pros: Large lens, great zoom, super color, very stable, comfortable grip, good settings and able to take great pictures while you are still learning them. A great point and shoot camera for non technical people who still want great pictures.Cons: I usually use the auto focus and there is a delay of a few seconds while the camera focuses before I can snap the picture. This is a pain sometimes, and I miss some great spur of the moment pics because of it.  The lens cap is a pain, too, as it is not attached. I haven't yet, but am afraid I will lose it.
