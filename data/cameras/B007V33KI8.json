Nothing indicated that the only way to retrieve the pictures off this was to take it into a Walgreens. What a waste of time!", "Date": "September 23, 2013"}, {"Title": "Misleading", "Author": "Cavanaughty", "ReviewID": "RGF23ROGEHL7J", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "The camera only holds 50 pictures.  Seller failed to note that you cannot upload the pictures from the camera without going to Walgreens and paying to get them printed.  Only then can you get a copy of your pictures on a disc.  This definitely should have been included in the product description.", "Date": "December 12, 2013"}, {"Title": "Great Value Camera!", "Author": "Paula J Herendeen", "ReviewID": "R3BGN4H1JHA77L", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Great camera and wonderful value.
