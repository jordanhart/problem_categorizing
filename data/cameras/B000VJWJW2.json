{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Great Camera with HD Capability", "Author": "Brian Wallace", "ReviewID": "RMI8GBQXVT7LH", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Since 2002 I've had the same digital camera. It was an older Kodak 2-megapixel camera that did it's job - if just barely. It was light on features, and took acceptable pictures - in 2002 when it was introduced. Fast forward to now, 2007, with a new son and grandparents wanting lots of photos, and my wife (who seldom notices anything about technology) complaining about the quality of the photos that it took and it added up to being time to upgrade our digital camera.I wanted to purchase the Canon Digital Revel XTi since I had an existing telephoto lens that would fit it. My wife wanted to a pocket-sized camera she could fit in her purse. Needless to say, we were in a predicament. The solution? A camera with a good optical zoom and a number of different picture-taking modes.Originally we purchased the Kodak Z712 IS - which we were quite happy with. The only thing it lacked was the ability to take high definition video. A few weeks later I discovered that the very week that we purchased the Z712 Kodak shipped the Z812. So, the Z712 went back to the store and the Z812 arrived!  Here's my impressions:What I Really Like:Great optical zoom. A 36mm-432mm optical zoom means that nothing is out of range with this camera. Combined with the image stabilization feature you can get away with slightly slower shutter speeds at long focal lengths and still get nice pictures.A multiplicity of modes - As an amateur photographer I like having the ability to set my own shutter and aperture values depending on what I'm doing. At the same time, the availability of a fully automatic mode makes it a camera that is easy to use by anyone. Plus, having sixteen preset modes for special settings (night time shooting, portraits, snow, beach, etc.) is handy if you'd rather not mess with the stop settings yourself. In addition to being able to control the exposure you can also control the flash setting.Variable Color Settings - This is a relatively simple feature but on the advanced modes you can choose between \"Low Color\" \"Natural Color\" \"High Color\" \"Black and White\" and \"Sepia\". This lets you adjust the appearence of your photos as you take them rather than in a photo editing program later. I find that taking a photo in the mode produces better quality that editing it later in a photo editing program.Multiple Photo Features - Besides the standard self-timer, there are two settings for taking multiple photos. One takes five consecutive photos in rapid succession. The other will take up to 30 consecutive photos in rapid succession and store the last five.High ISO settings - High ISO settings allows this camera to take photos in low light conditions. While the quality of low light pictures isn't exceptional, they're not awful either.HD Video - by far my favorite feature is the ability to take 720p video at 30 frames per second. It takes a computer or high definition TV to really appreciate the superior quality of this video. The fact that the sound is stereo is cool, but the quality is about average for a digital camera.(Update: Since I originally reviewed this I have owned an cheap Aiptek 1080p HD video camera and a Canon Vixia HF10 camcorder.  Both blew the video quality of the Z812 out of the water.  Just be forewarned, this is in no way a replacement for a video camera).What I Don't Like: honestly, nothing. There's no major problems with the camera itself. That's being said, there's a few features that would have been nice.On a camera of this caliber, it would have been nice to add an external flash for low-light conditionsSince this camera is labled has \"HD\" and takes high definition video, it would have been nice to be able to use a component cable connection to output 720p/1080i video direct from the camera.Out of the box the camera comes with a disposable battery. The least Kodak could have done was include a rechargeable battery in the box. I ended up purchasing two rechargeable batters and an AC charger for it.Summary: If you're not quite ready for size or cost reason to go with an SLR but want a high performance camera that includes the ability to take HD video, this is a perfect camera.", "Date": "November 11, 2007"}, {"Title": "A Great Camera at A Great Price - Terrific Photos, Rich Feature Set!", "Author": "eric talerico \"Greenmanwest\"", "ReviewID": "R1AMPWSH0JOSP0", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Kodak Easyshare Z812IS 8.2MP Digital Camera with 12x Optical Image Stabilized Zoom I picked up this camera recently as a replacement for  a Kodak z710.  I was not entirely happy with the z710, but I was familiar with its feature set, and thought the extra megapixel on the 812 might be a slight improvement.  Boy was I in for a shock!  I took the darned thing out of the box in the parking lot of the store where I bought it, popped in the battery, attached the lens cap and neckstrap, and snapped a few quick ones through the windshield - and I was blown away.  This camera is in a whole different catagory from its predecessor.  The color quality is vibrant and intense, the feature set is broad and inclusive. The 12x optical zoom is nothing short of miraculous, coupled with Kodak's image stabilizing system to bring you into the action without losing sharp detail.The Z812 has a few bells and whistles that I wasn't expecting - for example , in panoramic mode it allows you to, in camera, produce seamless panoramic shots stiched together from three separate shots. Get this - you shoot the far left area of the scene.  In your next shot on the viewfinder you will see a small section of the previous shot superimposed over the next area - so you can line up your shots perfectly!  The z812 does the same for the third shot - and shazaam!  Stiches the three together perfectly, matching exposure and color saturation!The z812 picks up incredible detail, has multiple and complex focussing cababilities, and the eight pixels let me print quite competently up to the full 13x19 that my printer allows without visible artifacting.  In a pinch it also allows for some serious cropping!In sillhoette/backlighting situations I have not noticed any purple fringing at all - that had been a problem with previous cameras.  Detail is good, even in subjects like distant foliage (which had not been the case with the 710!)And there are loads of useful other settings as well.  The candlelight setting does a nice job of capturing warm and well exposed images with a minimum amount of light, and almost no digital noise!The manual settings are great too - easy to find in the menu, and with a decent spectrum of settings.The burst setting is very much improved too -  the camera almost instantly generates your images - they show up on the viewfinder as they are being shot!  Nice touch.The 2.5 inch HD LCD display is huge and crystal clear, and the viewfinder offers a near HD image as well.  You can (finally) really see what you are shooting in any light!  (although it picks up some digital noise at higher ASA settings.)The buttons are all conveniently positioned for easy access.And if all that is not enough - get ready to be blown away by the video capabilities of this camera.  I shot 20 minutes of footage at a Gunfight in Tombstone AZ.  It looked good on the camera screen, but I was ready to be disappointed when I got it on to my computer screen.Well, folks, I have to tell you I was not disappointed.  The video was crisp, clear and colorful, without alot of posterizing (which had been a problem with the video on earlier models) In dim light there was a bit of digital noise in the videos.  It may not be on par with some of the high end HD recorders out there, but its better than alot of the low end ones I've tried, and with a little practice and study, I suspect I can produce some really nice movies with this.The camera interfaced easily with iPhoto and with the Adobe CS3Bridge to upload my photos and movies in record time!And that is just denting the surface.  As I've said, I've only had the camera for a few days, and only shot 200 or so images.AddendaFive months after purchase I am still extremely happy with this camera.  Much as I appreciated the automatic functions in the first few weeks, I'm reaching the point where I nearly always have the camera in Manual setting mode - its easy to shift between aperture, shutter speed, and ASA settings (there is a little wheel on the upper right side of the camera at the back, easily accessible by thumb! Turn it to select the function, press it to set your level.)  I don't hesitate any more to take multiple bracketed exposures at different settings.I have been impressed with how well this camera operates under most natural light conditions.  My one minor annoyance is that occasionally it decides on its own that it wants a flash - and I have to push the flash shut, and hit the \"no flash\" option to override it.  A minor annoyance and an avoidable one (a bit more thought in the moment!)  I've used it in nearly every imaginable lighting condition - from very bright noonday sun, to night shots, and have been able to capture just what I wanted.If I have any disappointment with the camera to date it is that it does such a good job of capturing the shot I want that there's no need to play with the images in Photoshop! My 2 GB SD memory card will take around 730 shots - although the battery, fully charged will only handle around 250.  With spare battery in my bag, I can shoot for a week without plugging in or having to download anything.So, in a nutshell, here's my assessment - a great camera, at a great price, with an  Intuitive interface and an easy  learning curve!  If you are on the verge of stepping up to an SLR, but not ready to fork over the $700 this is a very reasonable alternative!Great job, Kodak!", "Date": "September 17, 2007"}, {"Title": "Lite weight and a Joy to use", "Author": "Amazon Customer \"Flo\"", "ReviewID": "RFDXILIJ2RKPK", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I was looking for a light weight camera that had a powerful zoom. well this one is both plus more.

The ONLY thing I was not happy with is the darn thing does NOT come with a charger. You have purchase that seperately. At a  $300 price point, I think that  a charger should have been included.

It is the epitome of high value, innovative and sexy design, and user friendliness.  My Canon Powershot S50 died recently, and when I saw the Z812IS, its 12X optically stablized zoom, and HD Video I was intrigued.  It was not until I hooked up the camera to the optional HDTV dock that I began to really appreciate what this guy can do.Color stills are fabulous.  HD Video:  it works!  I wanted HD video for golf swing analysis, and did not wish to part with the $$ for a standalone HD video camera, so when this appeared it was a God-send.  You can do frame-by-frame advance on your big screen, at 30 frames per second at 1280 x 720 (720p--good 'nuf for my purposes), and you can extract sequences off of your videos so it absolutely perfect for my needs.  There are multiple other features adding value as well.  Lag time to shoot is decent.Be aware the low price goes up as you will definitely want to accessorize this honey.  The HDTV Dock, which doubles as a battery charger, is a must if you own an HDTV.  I bought a 2GB SD 133x flash memory card which will meet my needs just fine for now.  If an 8gb 133x or greater card comes along I will probably pick this up for lengthy video storage.  This camera is the perfect hybrid video/still camera for someone on a budget who doesn't want to sacrifice features, output quality and ease of operation.  Up n running in seconds!

After working with the camera a few days I was able to get consistently excellent pictures. The zoom is great, there is almost no shutter lag and shot to shot time is excellent.But, when I took snapshots indoors using the flash, most of them were blurry.  It turns out that the Program Mode has a 1/30th flash sync instead of the normal 1/60 or 1/125.  If there is any movement by the subject the picture is ruined.  There are ways around this, but it takes a little extra effort.  In the end I returned the camera rather than fiddle with it before every quick, indoor flash shot.So, if you don't mind tweaking some settings, this camera takes very nice pictures.  But if you're looking for a point and shoot with a long zoom that will automatically give you great pictures, this may not be the camera you want.", "Date": "January 21, 2008"}, {"Title": "a marvelous piece of work", "Author": "R.

Robinson", "ReviewID": "R1SKT151LSDM4E", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I've had a Kodak 6490DX camera for a couple of years now and love it. My only complaint is the blurriness from no image stabilization. It takes excellent pictures. Well, when the Z812IS came out and I started reading the reviews, I couldn't imagine a camera better than the one I already had. My husband bought me the Z812IS for Christmas this year and let me tell you, it blew me away. It is amazing! You can zoom at full distance, it looks blurry on the screen, but when you take the picture, IT'S NOT BLURRY at all! The colors are wonderful (Thanks Kodak!) and bright, rich colors. The pictures are so very clear and sharp. I also love the additional features of this camera. You can crop right on the camera as well as \"enhance\" or \"fix\" the picture right on the camera. I've already sold three other people on this camera also. And two of them own recent models of Kodaks. The other one owns a much higher priced different brand camera that she doesn't like. (Paid over $500 for it.) She wants this one also. I know I haven't gotten into the technical aspects of it but everything you read about it is true. It's just honestly a GREAT camera and to me, worth way more than the sale price was. Kodak did a really good job with this one!My only complaint? You have to buy the rechargeable battery and charger for it but it's worth it if you search a get a good deal on them too. It'd eat up the disposable batteries really fast. Kodak really needs to reconsider including this. Other than that though, I have NO cons of owning this camera only many, many pros! Buy one. It'll be one of the best investments you'll ever make. If you don't throw it around (and buy the padded case to carry it in) it'll last for years! :)", "Date": "December 30, 2007"}, {"Title": "An exceptional camera for the price!", "Author": "S.

This is a 2 for 1 since I am able to video tape with it, which I could with my other camera as well, but I was never able to zoom in and out. This camera snaps pictures fast and easy and has an image stabalizer to make picture taking so much easier. I love the 8.2 megapixels and the 12X optical zoom. Perfect camera for the avid scrapbooker who takes tons of pictures! Best of all this camera is less than $300 which makes it quite affordable for what it does, which I don't even know half of what it is capable of yet since I have only owned for a couple of weeks. Very light weight and easy to use. I highly recommend this camera to anyone who loves photography as well as scrapbooking.

Daniels", "ReviewID": "R39EUAOBBX2QJ4", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "UPDATE: To those people who voted \"unhelpful\", I'm not trying to be helpful on the camera features, because other reviewers will cover that nicely, and I haven't used that part much.  Why don't you just read the other, CAMERA-FEATURE reviews and ignore this one and let the people looking at this for VIDEO/CAMCORDER FEATURES decide?UPDATE:  Transcend 8GB SDHC Class 6 card works well in this camera.I got a Z812 IS a couple weeks ago, because with the 720p video, it seemed possible that one purchase might meet my camcorder upgrade needs at the same time as getting a super zoom camera for action photos.So far, I have video(not taped I guess, maybe \"videocarded\" or \"videoclipped\" :-)four of my daughter's high school soccer games, using the 720p resolution. The conditions were nighttime stadium lights.  I shoot from high up in the bleachers to take in the overall action.After doing 4 games this way, while I am not a professional at this by any stretch of the imagination, I can share some experiences and tips:1) Overall, the 720p soccer game videos have turned out better than I've done with MiniDV consumer level cameras.  For example, better than a Canon ZR30 and Panasonic GV-81 (or was it GS-81, can't recall exact model #)2) A good tripod with fluid-damped panning is essential to quality videos.  If the pans are too fast, it looks awful.  (probably true of making video recordings in general).UPDATE: I finally found my Velbon Videomate tripod, and that's certainly the one I've found to be best for shooting sports video. The cheapie [...] ones from Target or Best Buy are rubbish in comparison.3) There is more going into and out of focus than I am used to with dedicated cameras.  I've gotten better at reducing the amount this happens.  Trying to minimize the amount of zooming I do seems to help.4) Since the manual says that only digital zoom operates during recording, I try to pick a zoom (each time I start/stop recording) that will require the least subsequent zooming.5) The images look pretty good on my big screen 1080i big screen TV, after I burn the video clips on the SD card to DVD and play the DVD.  There is a lot less blob-and-blur factor than with the MiniDV camcorders I've used, and it's much easier to pick out which player is which, during the action.  The color and image quality looks pretty good.  Maybe a stretch to say it's \"true\" 720p quality, but it's way better than typical home video quality.6) Burning to DVD has been a bit of a pain.  I'm new to Kodak and their Easyshare stuff, and couldn't find a way that allows one to burn a DVD with > 99 scenes (I stop/start the camera each time there is a delay, e.g., ball goes out of bounds) and each one is recorded on the SD card as a separate .MOV (Quicktime) file.I finally decided to just use Nero Ultimate 8, using the Nero Vision app, and the \"Make Movie\" feature.  I have to point to all the clips, and then click a button to put them all into the movie.  Then all the clips get put in the timeline.For some reason, only the video is coming through in the finished movie.  I haven't figured out why the audio doesn't also get loaded in as part of the .MOV file.  Based on some Googling, it looks like this is an issue with my computer missing an audio codec, but I still haven't gotten it to work just yet.There was another DVD program that came with my computer, \"Sonic MyDVD Plus\", that has more basic editing features but did get the sound into the finished movie.UPDATE: The goalkeeper from the high school team and her parents wanted to use my footage to create a \"highlights reel\" on DVD for her to share with college coaches that are interested in having her play for them.  The end project turned out quite good!7) When shooting video, THIS CAMERA SUCKS--storage space, that is!  At least when you shoot video clips, it sucks the Gigabytes up in short order.  By the time I do 40+ minutes of video, a 4GB card is full.  I'm using Sandisk Ultra II SDHC cards, $[...] or so from Costco, and have been happy with them other than filling them up.  I've ordered the Transcend 8GB class 6 SDHC card and I expect the full 45+ minutes of 720p video for a game will fit on that, probably around 80 minutes worth.  The word is that these 8GB cards will work in the Z812.  I have a cheaper 4GB card that seems to work OK too.  So maybe an initial rule of thumb is allow at least 1 Gig of storage space for every 10 minutes of video.  If you're shooting lower resolution, I'm sure the storage would go a lot further.8) The rechargeable battery hassle is really the pits too.  I did find shops that carry the KLIC-8000 battery, including Circuit City (better price) and Best Buy, but NOT the charger.  I understand the 8500 charger is the one needed.  I ordered a KLIC-8000 compatible charger on eBay, and it finally arrived and seems to work OK so far. Since people reported good results using LITHIUM CRV3 rechargeables, I had earlier picked up a kit of charger and battery (plus car adapter), LenMar brand, from BatteriesPlus for $[...] and it works OK, though it doesn't last as long as I think it should for recording video, only about 35-40 minutes.  The other options include paying $[...] for a 2-pack of CRV3 at Target.  To be fair, a disposable CRV3 did get me through 2+ games, including playback and uploading to computer.9) I really haven't used the photo capability of the Z812 much yet so don't have anything to contribute here.So my conclusion is that I'm happy I got the Z812 and, after getting familiar with it, it does a better job than a moderate-price consumer-level camcorder would do.  So anything it does on photos (and all the reviews there seem to be great :-) is at this point a bonus for me.Without the rechargeable battery hassles, review would have been 5 stars.", "Date": "October 15, 2007"}, {"Title": "Happy Camper", "Author": "C.

The second one I still have and am quite pleased with but after going to a dog show and trying to take pictures of the dogs in the ring I realized I was in serious need of more zoom capabilities. I love the ease of use of the Easy Share line and the numerous presets in scene mode, these are what I use most. This camera takes crisp clear pics even through the windshield of a moving car and in my backyard clear crisp pictures of my poodles in sport mode. If you need more zoom power and want ease of use I highly recommend this camera, it is a bargain. This is my first camera with image stabilization and I am getting fewer fuzzy shots. Another plus for me was the fact that I already had the Easy Share software loaded on my computer so all I had to do was plug in the camera dock that I purchased at the same time and I was ready to go without having to import my other pictures into new software.

FAST, FAST, FAST!", "Author": "HP9698", "ReviewID": "RF8MFTZT9SZ2F", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Awesome camera! First a little background. I have owned several Kodak cameras over the years, although my first digital was a Sony, so I am a little biased to Kodak. I loved my Z730 that was a few years old, but my son broke it on me so I decided it was time for an upgrade on features anyway. Did I say how much I LOVED that z730?!? So I wanted something that was similiar in style and function.I have 3 kids and another due shortly, so I take tons of indoor snapshots. I was seeking fast speed, short lag, a good zoom, easy to handle and program, excellent photos and good video (exactly the z730 features).I bought 2 cameras that I felt fit my criteria and budget, the Canon SX100 and the Kodak Z812. Never owned a Canon before, but they seem to get great ratings everywhere I searched. Of course, I also checked out the Nikon D40 (super fast, but no video), the Sony DSC-H10 (over my budget and got so-so reviews on indoor shots, but is fast) and several others. But the first 2 I purchased and tried at home under my conditions. Tried these side by side with my husband and then we swaped cameras and gave our thoughts. We both liked the Kodak better.The Canon SX100 is a perfect size, comfy to hold, takes various battery options, takes really nice photos, good response time without the flash...however, once the flash is used it takes FOREVER to recycle at about 4-8 secs (with 3 kids that won't work for me), the onboard program is not easy to use (hated it, Kodak is was easier), orientation does not keep pics face up if I snap at side angle (Kodak does), plus if you like a date stamp on the pics like I do, the Canon will only allow it on the \"postcard\" setting (Kodak has it on all settings). Overall nice megazoon camera, but too slow for indoor shots with flash and not a good menu set-up. I would rate this one about 3 1/2 stars.The Kodak Z812 is a bit bigger, but only like a 1/2 oz heavier than the Canon. I like the super fast speed of the Kodak Z812 shot to shot time and lag time...even with the flash used I could immediately snap the next shot without a wait. It has a crisp 230k pixel LCD and EVF. The Canon is 172k pixels (still nice) and only has an LCD which makes not much a difference to me b/c I rarely use a VF anyway. Both cameras have a 2.5in LCD. I like to set my camera at auto mode mostly with some tweaking from time to time. This camera happens to capture great videos and the zoom can be used while in use. Takes awesome crisp, clear, true to color pictures even when used in full zoom and macro mode. The program menu is so simple to use and navigate. I like the auto pop-up flash (the Canon has a maual flash) not that this is an important feature for me, but could be for someone else. The downside to the Kodak is the batteries. I do not like that Kodak put a disposable battery instead of a rechargeable one with a charger. It cost about $70 for these 2 added items. Te other thing I don't care for is where the zoom button is located, on the back and I prefer it to be with the snap button.

It was \"be in the moment; don't freeze the moment with a camera around your neck\". When I was a kid, one of my first jobs was processing Kodacolor one summer to buy a Pentax SLR. Two events broke me off from photography, first I photographed the weddings of several women I would've married myself and second when all my equipment was stolen. That was it for photography.But being an avid observer of new technology (I bought the first computer ; the first Sony VCR, etc.  for a lotta' bucks) and becoming tired of being the sucker I would now wait for the price to come down.I think I've now triumphed in buying this camera.

The camera is a bit smaller than it appears in ads, but it is very solidly built and has the perfect balance between auto features for me and grandma who just want to take a few decent pictures of the kids and the flowers out back, as well as numerous more complex features and manual override, allowing the owner complete control over the photo shot he/she is taking. In fact, there are many features on this little gem that otherwise only appear on other brands at hundreds of dollars more. My pictures that I take to work can stand with the D40s and D50s of the highly touted brand folks are spending in the thousands for... cameras they barely know how to focus. At any rate the focus on his baby is incredible, and with image stabilization, you can take pictures you never thought possible before at close to 50X magnification!!!! I have taken action shots in decent light with some minimal experimentation and achieved good results. I have enjoyed learning photography with the usability of the camera. The colors are fantastic. At around $210.00 there is no way you can go wrong here. Invest in a rechargeable Kodak battery and charger or camera dock/printer for the best battery life, but I have been amazed at the life I got out of the Lico3 battery in the box.

I had also been using a JVC camcorder for a number of years with no complaints also, but definately wanted to upgrade to a digital camcorder.  I had been checking on digital camcorders for the last year and couldn't quite decide on any one particular brand, I kept seeing pro's and con's for every camera.  So when I came across this Kodak Z812IS, it seemed it had everything I had been wishing for, in one unit and at an exceptional price.  I checked it out alot and really couldn't find any con's against it so I got it.  WOW, it takes amazing pictures, of course, but my biggest surprise was the video capability.  I bought an 8g memory card, so I would have plenty of room for both video and pictures.  And it definately has a lot of space for both!  The first thing I noticed about the video, is the stability.  The gel suspended chip technology gives an absolutely exceptional video.  It looks as though I am video recording on a tri-pod.  Amazing, is the best word I can to describe this camera.  All the features it comes with and the advanced technology, you cannot find a better deal for this price range.  When you purchase this camera, I recommend at least a 4g or 8g memory card, so you can use the video to the full extent.  I also bought the rechargeable batteries and charger.  My pictures are sharp, my video is clear and stable with good sound, the software it comes with is easy to use with Windows XP (I don't know about VISTA).

I have a high end Canon with a phenomenal telephoto and I get great standard shots with it.  However, the Kodak sings.  My photos are vividly colored and artistic effects are possible \"right out of the box.\"When my original Kodak Z812IS got dropped one time too many, after a very rugged and overworked five years on the job, I thoroughly researched the new models, and concluded that I wanted the same camera again.  I wanted the wider angle lens and the stereo sound that were sacrificed in newer models for other features that weren't as important to me.I was thrilled to have receive the same camera again, not to have to learn to fiddle with different settings...this is an almost perfect camera model, for one who wants to capture the beauty at hand under many circumstances.Though \"only\" 8mp, the right professional printers can use these images to create very large scale products, including banners.  I've had gorgeous 24\" x 32\" prints made with clarity akin to being \"there.\"The zoom on this camera is clear and sharp to great distances.  I delight in photographing eagles in trees across the waterway, seals and otters hunting fish...Being able to photograph people indoors, without flash and silently so as not to interrupt or distract others, is one of my favorite benefits of this camera.  It is great to be able to turn the shutter and other sounds completely off.  To suppress the flash.  To set the hi ISO.  To zoom in and know the image stabilization is at work to get those shots.It is rare for this camera to be further than 6 feet from my hands.  I use it in the kitchen to document recipes, in the garden to show harvests.  What better way to extend the life of a bouquet even further?This camera has built a library of shots of boats and maritime activities in Port Townsend, WA.

My first digital camera was a Kodak several years ago (C300). It served me quite well for a long time and thousands of photos.  But I began wanting something a bit more up-to-date and high-quality.  I have owned several other brands since buying that first faithful camera, but almost all have quit working while the C300 still gets the job done (if the pictures are low resolution).So, when I began shopping for a new camera - I was favoring Kodak.  My experiance has been that their WasyShare line cameras are generally well-built, reliable camera (if sometimes a bit quirky).I found the Z812is back in June when my family and I were planning a week-long vacation.  The resolution was pretty impressive (at 8.2mp).  The 12x Optical Zoom seemed useful, and the price (at that time) was decent.I did not review this camera immediately, because I wanted to really put this camera through it's paces.I'm not a professional photographer by any means, though I do take a pretty good family/scenic shot from time to time if I do say so myself.  But this is a great camera for still photos.  The colors are sharp, the features are useful and plentiful, and the camera is easy to use.  Here are some of my findings.Pros;1) Good resolution (enlarge to 16 x 22 with no real pixelation).2) Zoom (gets you right into the shot from a distance).3) weight (I find that a heavier camera is often easier to hold steady).4) Manual button controls (I do not like the trend of some toward touch-screen and heavily menu based controls) but this camera has REAL button controls.Cons;1) Video feature (Video looks pretty good, but the audio is horrible if you are in a noisy location).2) You really do need the lithium-ion battery pack (but you can get a generic that is cheaper than the name brand).3) Start-up time (I find this camera to be a bit slow when first turning it on, so power up in anticipation of that once-in-a-lifetime shot).In conclusion - If you want a great (CONSUMER-LEVEL) point and shoot camera with a great zoom, this is it.If you want a camera that does well with video - look into an actual video camera. But for the family photographer - this is a great investment.By the way - you WILL need to pick up an SD/SDHC card as the file size of one photo tends to be in the 1.3mb plus range.  I suggest at least a four gig card because they are so cheap now.", "Date": "December 2, 2008"}, {"Title": "An exceptional camera @ great Price", "Author": "Bhupesh", "ReviewID": "R3RT5J1YNZ9AJD", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Before buying this camera, I delved on various digital cameras and after a lot of research, I had short-listed this camera and Canon Power shot S3. Finally I reached the conclusion that the Kodak Z812 IS had the best bash for the buck and selected this one based on following:1) this was costing approx $250 with rechargeable battery and charger (NON OEM) as compare to Canon S3 was costing approx $290 with Sony Batteries and charger.2) It has 7.1 mega-pixels as compare to Canon S3 which has 6.2 mega-pixels.3)  It has 2.5 inch LCD as compare to 2 inch in Canon S3.So in short I bought the Z812 IS because I wanted advanced features without the technical challenges and cost of a DSLR.I am very much satisfied with this camera. This is one of the greatest ultra zoom cameras presently available at its price, the best choice if you judge quality to cost ratio. It takes pictures that are very remarkable with great color reproduction and with fine details. Even videos are so great that it can beat some of the low end video cameras except the sound quality. Optical zoom is tremendous. There are around 20 scene modes, selectable with the menu steering buttons. Low light results are also very good. I was able to use \"night landscape\" mode efficiently to take otherwise difficult night cityscape photos. The camera chose a 10 second (!) exposure time at ISO 64, and the photos came out superbly.The image quality was very good. The main difference between this and the classier DSLR are the sensor sizes and interchangeable lenses. The Z812 has a 1/2.5\" sensor; DSLR's start at about 15 times that area and up. This makes a huge distinction in low-light and vibrant range of the pictures. But of course DSLR's are a lot bulkier and expensive. The Z812 has a lot of sophisticated features especially like the live histogram. Performance was overall quick, except when the buffer filled (about 5 burst pictures), then it takes almost 10 seconds to write it all into the memory card.The lens is reasonably fast, meaning the aperture doesn't close down too much when fully zoomed (its widest setting is f/2.8 to f/4.8 at 12x zoom), so there's more available light even at highest zoom, so the shutter can be fast enough to freeze sports action, or ISO can remain low for low noise.During my research I found many misleading reviews on battery issue. This camera works well with Lithium or Lithium-Ion rechargeable batteries. It is good idea to have Li-Ion rechargeable with charger. To buy original or compatible batteries / chargers is up to you. According to me it is not an issue at all. I bought 2 Non OEM batteries and charger from Amazon at 19 $ and they are working great.Another misleading was about the loose lens cap. If it was not kept loose, it would have easily damage the zoom mechanism if you forget to remove the cap before turning ON the camera.In a nut shell...No matter who you are, apart from professional photographer, the camera is apposite for you. You may use it as just point and shoot camera. Or you may play with more technical stuff like f-stop or aperture or shutter speed or exposure compensation or so on. Obviously it is not DSLR and how much you can expect in a $210 deal, but...  If you want some thing like DSLR at a price of point n shoot, this is the camera.

(this is an upgrade from a 2 \u00bd yr old 5mp, 8X zoom, Konica-Minolta z20)Pictures: I have only used it outdoors so far. Primarily skiing. Surprisingly light weight for its size. Very good quality pics even in automatic mode. One feature I love that I have not seen mentioned much, is the sensor to determine the orientation of the camera and automatically saving correctly so that you don't waste time having to re-orient the pictures later. IS works well, giving solid results even handheld at full zoom. Wish it had a dedicated review mode though - it always pops the lens cap off and drives the lens out of the main barrel even if your only intent is to show friends a few pics on the bright LCD. The menus are pretty obvious and useful for most items (including basic help descriptions available right on the camera) and I like the dedicated first burst/last burst/EV bracketing/timer, etc... and flash mode buttons right on top. I like the multiple focus boxes that show exactly what it thinks the highlights of the scene are so you can either snap or reset the frame. And super quick from the half press/focus to taking the picture for a digital camera.Video: I bought a 4GB card to go with the camera especially due to the video capability, which uses a lot of memory in HD mode. It eats something close to 2MB per second in some of my skiing clips! (though more typical seems to be closer to ~1MB per second) Video zoom on skiers works mostly very well, but occasionally loses focus in shadowy areas on a sunny day (too high a contrast I guess). There is some minor motor noise recorded from using the zoom in very quiet environments as well. As I am not looking for professional level audio (who would buy a still camera for that?), it's an acceptable, unobtrusive amount of noise. Also, my 3 yr old laptop chokes on the full HD sized video (skips/stutters), but fortunately my work laptop is new and can play the HD sized clips just fine.Summary: This camera is very good. And phenomenal options and features for the price. There are other options out there for marginally higher quality on either the pictures or video or amount of zoom or etc..., but you will double, or more, the price. Certainly not worth anything near that level of extra cost in my opinion given the capabilities and quality of the Z812IS.", "Date": "February 26, 2008"}, {"Title": "Stepping up", "Author": "Steven P.

This shutter is almost as fast as my Canon DSLR! I've only had my Z812 for a couple of days but I am amazed at the quality. Fast focusing, bright view of both screen and EVF, solid build, useful software (if you have no photo software yet), optional lenses, and optical image stabilization. I like this camera better than my Canon G8. The only thing I'm not too happy about is the use of lithium-ion batteries. They are expensive and don't last as long as I need them to. I bought a Moby lithium CRV3 rechargeable and this should work just fine. 8MP is still enough to make a gorgeous 16x20 print and if you use the Kodak software you can buy prints up to 20x30 at a reasonable price. The Z812 IS is not too bulky or heavy; it should fit nicely into almost any bag, especially a backpack. With a 4Gig SDHC card I can take almost 800 photos at the Fine setting.

Now they are in High School and Junior High, I use it to photograph and film my sons lacrosse games and my daughter's girl scout events.  Specifically, the IS is great for getting the inside the helmet sweat and Clash of the Titans field action on a high school lacrosse game.  The pictures rivaled a professional photographers stills as my pictures caught the action as it was happening.  I did purchase the extended zoom lense and fitting to get in that close.My daughter has used the video to produce videos for Girl Scout projects.  You will need a pod if you move as the pixilation gets hairy with the film crew moving and zooming in and out but the video looked great.  When we upgraded our computers to Windows 7, Kodak shortly came out with the interface software to edit photos.  Windows Movie Maker also helped lower the cost and produce a great video.In short, I love this camera for someone who does not have a lot of time or money to figure out the features and wants to document their children's accomplishments without going broke.

(I think it's 0.23 sec.)The camera also takes exceptional pictures at a distance. For cars in motion, it's easy to pan along with them to get that speed effect, using a shutter speed of less than 1/320,and the screen & view finder do not go blank when taking pictures at a slower shutter speed. I also used it to photograph close ups of morning glorys. The detail is outstanding. For the batteries, I purchased 2 KODAK(KLIC-8000)Li-Ion rechargeables.I also purchased a KODAK High Performance 2GB memory card. I don't know the performane of this(or why I bought it), but the 2GB memory card that came with the camera is sufficient,holding over 700 photos.

So enter Amazon and the search for a new camera.  My wife is a technophobe (afraid of technology), so when considering another camera I had to make sure it was close to the old one because she knew how that worked, and since I am deployed I cannot show her in person how a new one worked.As I start searching for a new camera of course I start with new items, but alas I am miser and I don't want to spend a fortune on something that may break within a year or so.  (I will caveat that the last Kodak easyshare was still working great after three years and was still working great until my wife dropped it on the ground at a bowling alley. lens first no less - and that camera had been all over the place, including Egypt).After searching new I fell upon the idea of refurb - I personnaly have been buying refurb products for the last couple of years and haven't seen any problems.  Both my iPods and Macbook Pro are refurbs.I searched all the Kodak's and Fuji and Panasonic and ended up with the Z812IS.  The price was fantastic (under $120 total) and the features were better than the last model.  The MP is higher from 6.1 up to 8.2, the Optical focus is up form 10x to 12x, so you can get that much closer.  Some of the buttons have changed and it takes a little longer to navigate them.  One major improvement is the capability to use AA batteries instead of just the CRV3/or rechargeable Kodak battery (Which I use).  If you don't have the rechargeable then I suggest the Energizer Lithium batteries - the best on the market.  The one item I do miss is the automatic sport function on the selection knob on top.  I have never used the email function.  The clarity and ease of use make this a top quality camera for a low low price (refurb only).For those looking for a high quality camera, easy use camera for technophobes and a cheap camera (refurb) than I highly reccomend this one.Thanks", "Date": "July 13, 2009"}, {"Title": "Great Camera for the price", "Author": "Allen Christian", "ReviewID": "R2EEQ18EFOI9BR", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "This was a good upgrade for our family.

After reviwing CR - and feedback here at Amazon, I asked for this from my wife at Christmas with the goal of replacing my trusted old film SLR.  I also want to include that my wife has a nice Canon sureshot - but it's too small for my hands - so in my quest to replace my SLR, I considered several models and went with Kodak because I was happy with my older camera's and it met my requirements.I'm just wrapping up a 2 week vacation where I have had a chance to really get to know this camera, and its capabilities.  I LOVE IT!  I can now say that I made the right choice - and I'm glad that I didn't pay the extra money for a digi SLR.  I'm not a pro - however I had been semi-pro many years ago when a good Minolta SLR was the only thing I could afford.  At the time, I had considered going pro and buying a high quality Mamiya...  The only drawback with this new Kodak is that you can't change lenses - however my style of photography today doesn't really warrant that requirement.The manual features that this camera has, choice in viewfinder capabilities, the many settings that you can choose and switch to - WOW is all I have to say.  After reading the booklet (a must because it's not all that intuitive until after you give the book a quick read) I have made use of almost all of the features.  From stiching a landscape, to the macro focus used to take pix of flowers, to the low light musuem settings...

There is a slight lag that, unless you are taking pictures of still life or scenery, is really annoying.

If you want detailed info on this camera to really try out its features you have to download it from the Kodak website - inconvenient and irritating.  Kodak is trying to same a few dollars at the expense of their customers.I noticed too that the camera would often make a \"purring\" type noise.  On the positive side it did take nice macro photos.I ended up instead purchasing the Canon PowerShot SX100IS 8MP which is a fabulous camera and a much better choice.  The optical zoom on this camera is slightly less than the Kodak- 10 instead of 12 - but is a much better camera for a similar price.

And is there anything on the screen that tells me how much of the optical zoom I'm using, or should I just assume that the close-up function will stop when I reach maximum? The instruction booklet doesn't explain what all the symbols are that I seen on the LCD screen. The camera makes a noise when running. I'm not even sure when I've taken a photograph because it doesn't really click. How do I use image stabilization -- or does it just go into action when the camera shakes? I'm afraid to try the video function because I have no way of knowing how much of a 2GB card I'd be using up with video. Is there any way to know? Kodak's website merely repeats the meager information in the instruction booklet. I won't be using it with Easyshare because that was never my intention.
