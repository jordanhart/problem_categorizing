The size 9.2\" is fine, but I think the next size bigger would work even better (10.4\" version).-better picture than the original CRT monitor-standard VGA plug-does not come with its own power supply - but a re-purposed old laptop 12v out power supply seems to power it without issues.-the power on button needed pressed the first time the monitor is powered up, after that the monitor auto starts with power application.-the first time the monitor was powered up nothing showed on the monitor. Pressing the \"input select\" once fixed that.-uses far less power and takes up way less cabinet room than the old monitor did.I like it.(If it dies soon - I will update review)", "Date": "February 10, 2012"}, {"Title": "VERY GOOD", "Author": "Nafty", "ReviewID": "RXGB8P5HCDO2S", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Just hooked up the screen for my Frond door cam,I can say it is very good, and worth the money!Bigger size recommended, but i didn't have room, I can send u pics,just reply to post", "Date": "May 16, 2012"}, {"Title": "power supply update", "Author": "Nafty", "ReviewID": "R1XINY21Y3LANN", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Here is the power supply to be used with the moniter, http://www.amazon.com/review/r12u19iach4pbm,I have read other reviews saying that this power supply work well with the pyle screen, (note I did not make the video review.
