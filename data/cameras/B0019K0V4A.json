{"Reviews": [{"Title": "A few anomalies but good overall", "Author": "Hornbeam \"LWS\"", "ReviewID": "R1KNF3UBPXYOZ8", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I purchased three Argus Bean cameras as gifts for our three young grandchildren. They were identical except in color, one being red, one pink, and one green.  A few days before Christmas I thought it would be wise to open them and be sure they would be ready to use on Christmas Day.  Good thing I did that, since I hadn't realized they would need a charge before the first use.The first problem arose regarding the charge.  A sticker on each camera said it needed one hour of charging before the first use.  I plugged one into my Mac since the \"AC adapter\" listed in the on-line manual as part of the basic equipment was not provided.  As I read further in the online manual, I saw that it stated that the camera required a 4-6-hour initial charge.  I decided to leave the camera plugged into the USB on my Mac overnight.There is no phone support available from Argus, but I did receive fairly quick email responses to my queries, the first of which related to the charging issues.  Initially I asked where the AC adapter was.  After a couple of confusing exchanges, I finally deduced that in that respect the online manual is not up to date.  There is no AC adapter provided.  The cameras must be charged through USB connections on a computer.The Argus rep then offered an instruction that I never found anywhere in the printed materials - that after the first charge the camera must be full discharged immediately and then recharged in order to preserve battery life.  My questions as to how one goes about fully discharging a camera that turns itself off after some predetermined number of seconds of no use were never answered, so I was unable to follow that instruction.After a full night of charging each camera, only one of them indicated it had a full charge.  The person on the Argus end of our email exchanges finally decided my three cameras must all be \"old\" since they wouldn't hold a full charge, and he/she offered me the chance to return them, but with no guarantee of what color camera I would receive as a replacement . . .  no suggestion of what I'd have to give my grandchildren in a couple of days as Christmas gifts.  We did not choose to return them, and I took a chance on presenting the cameras on Christmas with the best charge I could manage.Now that our kids have had their cameras for nearly two weeks, my daughter tells me that neither of the two that went to her family ever shows a full charge for more than the initial instant after disconnecting from the computer.  Yet my grandson has used his for days, including taking long videos, and the charge has not yet given out.  There must be something wrong with the way the degree of charge shows up on the camera screen, since the charge seems to last a very long time.  She is quite pleased with the cameras and their ease of use with her 5- and 7-year olds.Argus states that the photos taken by the Bean cannot be downloaded to a Mac.  I purchased three memory card readers since we are a family of Mac users, but I did not open them in case they were not needed.  Sure enough, the cable provided by Argus can be used to download to iPhoto on a Mac and the memory card readers were not needed.All in all it appears that these were good cameras for our 3, 5, and 7 year old grandchildren.  I just wish Argus had phone support - or at a minimum provided printed or email support that corresponded with the facts of the cameras themselves.", "Date": "January 6, 2010"}, {"Title": "Good for the daylight, but...", "Author": "Sew Perfect", "ReviewID": "R3PQJZWZVBKP3O", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "This camera takes excellent photos in the daylight.  Indoors, the flash over compensates and your pictures are washed out.  I still would recommend it just for outdoor shots that my kids can take on their own.  They have used it on school field trips and trips to many carnivals and fairs.  It's very easy to use.  Having said that, the camera is not as durable as I thought.  We've only had it for 5 months and already the power switch and joystick have stopped working.  It comes with a one year warranty so I am contacting the manufacturer for a repair/replacement. I didn't expect it to break so fast.  I have heard that Argus wants the customer to pay at least $10 for shipping.  I'm not to happy if that is true.  It's not my fault their product broke after only a few months of use.  Considering what I'd spend buying and sending disposable cameras on field trips with my kids, it's still worth it.  It takes a SD card so you can download your photos in an instant.", "Date": "October 9, 2008"}, {"Title": "Great Camera for my kids", "Author": "ckelly", "ReviewID": "RPGDS9VYR5K3N", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I bought this for my kids to have an opportunity to take their own pictures of our recent trip to Disney.  They really enjoyed snapping pics with it (especially my 10-year old).  It makes good pictures in daylight but don't expect much if it is dark - or even dim.We had one replaced (thanks Amazon!) because the direction pad on the back of one of them broke the first day.

It is great for him. he can take great photos and clip it to his belt, it is rugged and sturdy. We have not gotten prints yet but were told that it will do up to a 5x7. I know that it has been dropped about 3ft from the ground and still keeps working.

He is prone to dropping things so I wanted a more durable camera and this seemed like the perfect one. I like the size and the carrabiner clip and even the little camera itself is cute and well made. It just does not take good pics. Like the other reviewers stated the flash whites out peoples faces indoors. Outside it is not much better. While on vacation to Seattle my son just could not take any pics what so ever. He did get some video that was ok. The camera has held up quite well even when dropped. The viewfinder is really tiny and the camera itself is hard to hold. The buttons are confusing for me, but my 7 yr old figured them out with no problem. The battery holds up pretty well considering. All in all I am unhappy with my purchase and will be returning this Bean. I picked up a cheap \"package\" digital camera at WM for about $15.00 cheaper and the pics are a lot better. Even the view finder is bigger. Still not perfect, but until my 7yr old learns to not drop expensive things, it will work for us. As a camera lover myself, I cannot wait to buy him a nice camera-something he and I can actually be proud of!", "Date": "January 13, 2009"}, {"Title": "This is a case of 'you get what you paid for'", "Author": "Tiny D \"Lonely Guy 69\"", "ReviewID": "RAA5J1JF30H1L", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I thought it looked cool and would give it a shot despite others negative reviews.  Boy did I regret it, the camera is broken right out of the box!  When I take pictures it doesn't even flash, following the instructions and a full battery charge, which results in blurry dark and grainy pictures even outside in the sun!  When I set it to 'flash when taking a picture' mode, the lcd screen keeps turning on and off as if the capacitor from the 'flash'light is draining all the life out of the camera!  And it quits responding!Also, the software doesn't work.  I can't even use it as a pc camera, shame.I have lots of experience with high tech equipment and a masters in electronics engineering, so I know what I'm doing.  I'm not a noob in handling a simple camera.  I have tossed it in the trash and considered it a lesson learnt.", "Date": "April 24, 2012"}, {"Title": "Dead Battery", "Author": "smrsxn", "ReviewID": "R16IFRWGBMOUC4", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "Got the camera today... charged for 6 hrs.Guess what... as soon as i take off the camera from power supply it does not even start up!!!I promised my son a camera for christmas this year... and he has been talking to his Santa (soft-toy) about it all the time.

I realy like the form factor it was well sized for small hands. The loop and clip are great for a child to clip onto belt loops and a wrist band that comes with camera. Very smart since you want to stay away from things that go around the neck. Has a small LCD to frame the shot. It doesn't go into feature over kill and just the right amount of features. It even has a flash. You provide the SD card and a 1 or 2 gig card is quite ample. The software is for the PC but my son's computer is a G5 iMac. We just use iPhoto and that works fine.The down side is the image quality. Having a lot of pixes is not as important as image quality. Basicly it is at the level of a camera found it a cell phone. In fact my iPhone produces better images. But satisfactory images can be had you need to learn  the limitations. The camera is quite unforgiving about shake even with flash. This may be a good thing as it will teach them to hold the camera still. But if this is never going to happen with you child the images will be dispointing. Low light is another weakness. It does have a flash but it is over powering in the more common distance one would shoot the camera 4-5ft. The image has little image latitude and exposure needs to be on or the image will not work very well.Basicly I have gotten better images out of an 10 year old olympus 1.3 mega pixel camera then this camera. This is why I am being more critical about this camera. I think if they did 2 mega pixels and did it well would be more valuble then 5 as it is done in this camera.Other then that I think it is a good first time camera for a kid.", "Date": "November 29, 2008"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": "Unavailable", "Features": "Argus Bean 5 MP Digtial Camera Green\npoint-and-shoot-digital-cameras\nBean 5 MP Digital Camera Green\nBEAN5MPGREEN", "Name": "Argus Bean 5 Megapixel Carabiner Digital Camera", "ImgURL": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/31wI8rn5mYL._SY300_.jpg", "ProductID": "B0019K0V4A"}}
