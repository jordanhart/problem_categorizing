{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Decent but overpriced", "Author": "EmbeddedFlyer", "ReviewID": "RV7YCD0R9WPHD", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "This is my 3rd Panasonic pocket sized Lumix. The first was 5 megapixels and had a 3X zoom. It still works great but I wanted a longer zoom and more resolution so I bought the DMC-FS15 about a year ago. The FS15 has 12 megapixels, a 5X zoom, but no touch screen.Despite having more than double the supposed resolution, the FS15 delivered similar real-world resolution to my old 5 MP camera. This is because for a given size sensor, more pixels means more noise. So the camera has to apply more noise reduction which softens the image. It's sadly more about marketing (and perhaps bragging rights) than image quality.I really liked the FS15 until the lens jammed one day while trying to turn it off. So I bought the FX75 expecting it to be a big upgrade given it's more than twice the price. It's really not. Panasonic really should stop the marketing game with megapixels because more isn't always better. This camera has more noise at any ISO than my older (much cheaper) camera. And professional reviews, and my own test shots, back that up.That said, most of the other brands are doing the same thing. They're all trying to raise the resolution of each generation of new models. But image quality, in many cases, is actually getting worse. Again, I suggest reading the reviews (i.e. steves-digicams, dpreview, etc.).The touch screen is the \"big\" new feature of this camera. It's no iPhone, but it works fairly well. Panasonic mostly took the old menu system and just adapted it to work on the touch screen. With less room needed on the back of the camera, the display can be a bit larger which is nice. I suspect most will find it easier to use than the old button method.You need a fairly accurate touch to do things like force the flash on, or off, adjust the exposure compensation, etc. If you were in a moving vehicle, have really big or clumsy fingers, or poor vision, you might prefer conventional buttons where you can somewhat run the camera by \"feel\".Users who just leave their camera on \"auto everything\" all the time, will likely love this camera. Panasonic has done a good job building a lot of intelligence into the full \"iAuto\" mode and it works suprisingly well for most shots. But there are still situations where, for example, you don't want the flash. For those you'll need to use the touch screen.Another big advertised feature of this camera is the f2.2 \"bright\" or \"fast\" lens. For those of you not up on f-stops and other photo jargon, that means the camera can generally use a faster shutter speed which can make the difference between a blurry or sharp picture. It helps, but a caution is in order. This lens is also wider than the cameras it replaces (24mm vs 29mm effective). It's only f2.2 at 24mm. If you zoom in a bit to get to 29mm it's f2.5 vs the old f3.3--not a huge difference when you're comparing apples-to-apples. And at full zoom, it has no advantage at all. Because it starts wider, it doesn't zoom in as close as the older 5X models. Still, at full wide, shutter speeds are about 50% faster.Panasonic also touts their \"Sonic Speed AF\" which does focus a but quicker than my older Lumix cameras, but not dramatically so. Like the faster lens, this might help with a few shots but it's not a huge deal for most pictures.Finally, this camera has 720P (but not 1080) HD video and can record in the older Motion JPEG (Apple .MOV) format, or the newer AVCHD Light format. This is a significant upgrade if you like to shoot higher quality video. But for typical You Tube clips, etc. it's not a big deal. And HD formats take a lot more space on the SD card. In the highest quality format, a 2 GB empty card (no pics) will record about 15 minutes of video.The build quality seems a bit better than my previous models (as it should be for twice the price). Hopefully it will last longer and not suffer issues with the extending lens. If you turn your camera on and off a lot and expect to take lots of pics, I would suggest looking at one of the pocket models that don't have an extending lens. That saves a lot of mechanical wear and tear.I've also owned, and used, assorted other brands including Canon, Minolta, Pentax and Olympus. I like the balance of size, price, image quality, Leica lens quality, feature set and user interface of the Panasonic models better overall. Canon, in particular, does a few things better with their pocket models (I own a few of their DSLRs), but Panasonic seems to have the best overall product.Still, I'm not sure the FX75 is worth the current price. Touch screen models are getting premium prices but I suspect that will change. Also, for those wanting full 1080HD video, and/or full manual control along with apeture priority, shutter priority, etc, consider the even more expensive DMC-FX700 which is bascially an FX75 with those features added.The cheaper FH20 has an 8X zoom and has received only meodicre professional reviews. Between the 14 MP sensor and being a \"super zoom\" crammed into a tiny pocket camera, image quality really suffers. But if you just want snapshots, it might be a decent, and much cheaper, option.", "Date": "September 22, 2010"}, {"Title": "Wide and bright", "Author": "Transcendant \"T\"", "ReviewID": "R2U6E672RPAXE6", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I got this camera within a week of it's release and just before my trip to Alaska.  It performed beautifully in most light conditions.  There is a learning curve in mastering all of the options.  The anti-shake, intelligent auto and touch screen worked well.  The AVCHD is a pain as this proprietary software prevents you from viewing files directly from camera to most wide screens. The video record button is also hard to find so this causes shaking when stopping a video.  My wife brought along our old DMC FX9 so we had a basis of comparison of picture quality.  The FX75 produced far superior color and clarity.  Very nice compact camera with a bright lens, very competitively priced.", "Date": "August 31, 2010"}, {"Title": "Major Exposure Issues mar an otherwise fabulous camera", "Author": "Jungle NYC", "ReviewID": "R1QGZG617WPVVR", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "I've waited a couple years now for this camera to come out, because I've loved the Lumix series from the get-go. I think, in general, the Lumix line is underrated, and a darn good value (especially compared to Canon). For the FX70/75 specifically, I like the idea of having such a wide, bright lens (Leica, no less) even though I think they should include more manual features in their ultra-compacts... I have a DSLR, so a micro-snapper, albeit totally \"automatic\", is a good thing to have.The FX75 a small camera, with a sturdy build, and it's \"modes\" are nice and varied, which offsets the lack of any manual control a bit. It takes darn good \"flash\" pictures (for weddings, parties, etc), with a better-than-normal color/flash/exposure balance.The image quality is very, very good, too. As long as you're under IS0-800, you're going to get a low-noise, crisp image with great, accurate color. However, the built-in \"sharpening\" tends to look a bit wonky on small details like leaves, or other natural elements. But with more man-made details (architecture, bricks, cars) that algorithm actually helps the image. So, it's a bit of a mixed bag. In fact, I almost wish they had an option to turn this \"feature\" off, allowing the user to apply their own sharpening in post via Lightroom or Aperture.But no. The FX70/75 insists on doing EVERYTHING for you.The touch screen is a welcome feature too (even if you don't use it to \"take\" pictures\"), and the visibility of the LCD in daylight really isn't that big of a deal.Because of the handy Touch Screen, there are very few physical buttons on the FX75. One of them is the \"MODE\" button wich, when pressed, you get 4 on-screen choices: \"Normal Picture\" (a poor man's \"manual\" mode); \"Intelligent Auto\" (which actually does a pretty good job of guessing your needs); \"Scene Mode\" (which takes you to a larger menu: sports, landscape, candlelight, etc, etc); and... \"Cosmetic Mode\" (which allows you to adjust face tones).Wait. What? Really guys? You have 4 options and one of them is a \"Cosmetic Mode\"? Is this supposed to be \"The Fashion Camera\" or something? At the very least the user should be able to assign that 4th choice, either with a commonly-used \"Scene Mode\" or a user-created variation for an extra \"Normal Picture\" mode. But if that's an option, I haven't found it. Because the manual is a bit intimidating, and a PDF, no less. Nevertheless dedicating such a prominent UI element to a \"Cosmetic Mode\" seems, well, strange.That said, it's not that big of a deal.What IS a big deal is that this camera, as noted in all the reviews, has major highlight and shadow problems, especially when shooting in the \"normal picture\" mode. If you're outside, on a sunny-ish day, casually shooting pics, you are going to have a ton of snaps that are either blown-out, or way under-exposed. And, more often than not, you'll have both in one picture. Literally white-white highlights AND black-black shadows. It's really sad, actually.Yes: all cameras have their pluses and minuses. But this little camera has SO much going for it that these very basic exposure issues are really a let-down. Frankly, this is an issue that feels very \"2001\" in terms of technical performance. It has all these wonderfully modern bells and whistles, but when you check out your pictures of that family picnic you find yourself shaking your head and asking \"...really?\".The FX75 does provide an \"intelligent exposure\" option, which helps a tiny, tiny bit. But if you have that turned \"on\", then it overrides your ISO preferences, even in \"normal picture\" mode. So all of a sudden you may get stuck with an ISO-1600 picture (which is extremely noisy) taken in the day time. Which is crazy, and a real shame.Overall, it's almost as if they paid so much attention to the glitter, that they forgot the basics: ie., capturing a properly-exposed image.They could've easily included HDR or a RAW option so at least you'd have some room to play on the back end. But, sadly, no. Chances are you're stuck with a badly exposed JPG.Unfortunately, I don't know if something like a \"firmware upgrade\" can fix this problem. But I certainly hope so. Because if they can find a way to fix this, they'll have one of, if not THE best camera in this class. If not, I'll probably have to try and sell this (quick, before word gets out!), and buy another mini-snapper. And that sucks.", "Date": "October 30, 2010"}, {"Title": "Great camera, but it might as well not have a warranty (through Panasonic.)", "Author": "Mom of 4 girls \"Stacy\"", "ReviewID": "R251KGDUK6PX9S", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I LOVED this camera for the first 2 weeks (probably a little less.)  The pictures were beautiful, the features were great & easy to use and the touch screen was a fun perk!  However, I found out the zoom didn't work properly within the first 2 weeks of using it.  When I tried to use it, it would zoom in and out on it's own just to give me a \"zoom error\" and shut off.  I packed it up and sent it back to Panasonic since it was obviously still under warranty.  First of all, they give you no confirmation of receiving it and you just wonder for weeks if it's going to show up.  A lot of e-mails go unanswered for many days and the customer service representatives answering the e-mails don't seem to know what's going on.  When I called, I got passed around from department to department, just to finally be told they had it and I should get it back within 2 or 3 weeks.  Instead, I received a letter, telling me that it wasn't covered because it had been damaged (even shipping damage isn't covered.)  I think they just say that to avoid having to replace any camera.  They, then, offered to send me a refurbished camera with a 30 day limited warranty (that would probably have the same result) for close to $200.  At the time, I went for it because I wanted my camera back.  Then, weeks went by again.  I contacted them again and had one person tell me that they hadn't received it and I needed to get proof of its delivery from the post office.  Obviously, they had received it!  That's how they decided it was supposedly \"damaged\" and made the offer of charging me almost full price for a refurbished one.  I finally got aggravated and cancelled the order.  Well, I tried.  I got a message after I thought I had cancelled it, wanting to know what to do.  I haven't had any success at clearing it up yet.  Every person I talk to thinks something different is going on.  Panasonic's customer service is absolutely horrible and they only put the warranty on there to make you feel safe spending the money.  They don't honor it!To sum it up, I loved the camera and wish I still had it.  It's wonderful IF you never need it fixed or replaced.  However, I will never buy another camera from Panasonic again.

It does surprising well up to ISO 400 and maybe a little higher.  Love the Lumix brand. Great optics.  Already have and love Lumix LX-3 and Canon G10. Both great cameras.  This camera gets as close as you can to being a hybrid of this two cameras in a small form factor (except no RAW).  The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars is that the FX-700 has now dropped in price to be close to this and it offers Full HD video, plus more controls.  Both are very compact! Very user friendly with an excellent Intelligent Auto mode (bought for wife and she doesn't want to fiddle - just shot).  Included video software is only Windows and iMovie would automatically convert it.  You'll need 3rd party software so if a Mac lover (like me) deduct a few stars and think about getting the FX-700 which shots in an industry standard CODEC.  The price difference is the cost of the conversion software anyway.
