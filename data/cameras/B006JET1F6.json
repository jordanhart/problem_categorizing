I get great pic and it is light and easy to pack. i bought it for my mom and dad who are not very computer based. it is very easy to use and to make pic off of and put onto the computer. takes a normal sdhc card so cheap to get and works very nice with even a cheap class 10 card. so was a great buy all around. also has a very fair battery life.", "Date": "May 19, 2012"}, {"Title": "2nd one I've owned.", "Author": "lpatton", "ReviewID": "R1IX746WF3K9DU", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "This is the second one I have bought.  I like how fast it saves the picture to the sim card so that I can more quickly snap-snap-snap and get the shot that I want.  Important since I have active children.  My first one lasted about 2 years and then the lense wouldn't come out anymore.  IDK if that was from being knocked around or just a malfunction.  For the price and the quality of pictures, I'd be willing to purchase this camera every two years, but I hope this second one lasts longer.Wish this had come with the manual, but I can look the info up online, so not a huge deal.", "Date": "October 24, 2013"}, {"Title": "It doesn't work outside, when you go outside the entire screen turns black", "Author": "K.
