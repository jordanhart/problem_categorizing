You have to be a slow, deliberate photographer to use this thing, and it is only good in a very narrow realm; static images in good light at low ISO.  But in that realm, you'll be hard pressed to beat its IQ with anything less than a Phase One setup.  So don't buy it if you want modern camera bells and whistles, it has none, and it honestly barely functions as a camera - it's really simply a device for making breathtaking high detail photographs.  Patience and forethought are required but the end result is worth the effort.", "Date": "April 4, 2013"}, {"Title": "This camera must be from a parallel universe.", "Author": "Michael Haspert", "ReviewID": "RD72KZYIO6G5J", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "So much of what other cameras routinely do, it is abysmal at.1.  No image stabilization2.  100 and 200 are the only satisfactory ISOs for color IMHO.3.  Saving the picture after a shot is slow, probably because of the extra processing Foveon sensor data needs.4.  Raw conversion works but is slow-- same reason.5.  No live overexposure/underexposure warning and jerky LCD, again probably because of the extra processing needed. (There is overexposure warning when reviewing. This is the clue that shows the sensor data has been significantly massaged before being stored.)6.  The camera comes with two batteries. They drain fast--they charge fast. Either get more batteries or a car charger.7.  Does not do well with the sun in the frame: The flare is a particularly weird diamond pattern.8.  One in-camera choice of aspect ratio-- 3:2  ********* NONETHELESS **********When it succeeds, in its narrow niche of landscape or art shot in good light, it is so crushingly good that it earns five stars in spite of its list of flaws.1.  Amazing detail.2.  Smooth gradations in B/W3.  Unique saturated color in highlights.4.  Does a better job of rendering reflections in water and surface of water. It is hard to describe why I think it is better and it's a weirdly specific thing to be better at. Just go look at image samples and see if you see it too.Miscellaneous advice and encouragement.1.  I wrote this review because in the weeks since I bought it, it has accounted for 10% of my total shorts and 40% of my favorites. hey, that could happen to you.2.  I bought the Hoodman hoodloupe so I could see the LCD in the sunlight. It was either that or throw a towel over my head as if I was shooting a view camera.3.  I actually use a tripod with this camera.4.  The Luminous Landscape website has a long running thread \"Merrill DP experiences\" which is worth reading from beginning to end to see what you are getting into and to get the consensus on what's worth trying and what's not.5.  The interface seemed clunky at first, but it works oddly well, probably because it has a short list of features to control. You can get to everything you need at shooting time through the QuickSet scheme. I was used to the setup in a half-day of practice. (The exact opposite of wandering through my OM-D's menu maze for a week.)6.  Some people will buy this and will hate it, so check for it used. (Do not confuse it with the old DPs. )7.  Do not get sucked into the meaningless mexgapixel debate. Not all pixels are created equal and who cares how many Bayer pixels equal one Foveon pixel. Just look at the images and see if you like them.Good hunting.", "Date": "May 21, 2013"}, {"Title": "Why buy a camera?", "Author": "E. Nielsen", "ReviewID": "R2S0S3QDRWWR45", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "For people who want to take snapshots, low-light shots, or sports photos, don't get this camera. If you want to experience the stunning resolution of a medium-format camera in a size that you can easily take on trip, this may be your best bet. It will be unlike anything you've ever experienced before.I hesitated before buying this fixed-lens camera that was not reputed to do well in low light, since I was spoiled by the speed and convenience of a Canon PowerShot G11, which was a wonderful travel camera that does everything pretty well. However, I now rarely use the Canon because the end results of the Sigma DP2 Merrill are just so much more rewarding.Yes, it's harder to compose a photo when all you have is a fixed 30mm (45mm equivalent) lens. But you can zoom to your heart's delight after you upload the photo into your computer. And that's really where the fun starts. I'm frequently surprised by the details that I never noticed when taking the photo: expressions on the faces of people a block away, small signs in windows, an odd license plate on a car down the street, etc. It's like going back to the places you visited and seeing all the things you missed the first time. That's priceless.I tried a 20\"x30\" blow up of one landscape photo I took with the DP2M and it vastly exceeded my expectations. There is no discernible grain in the photo and phenomenal detail. Artistically speaking, it's a mediocre composition, but the scene is pleasant and the colors are rich and lively so I enjoy seeing it nearly every day.The Sigma DP2 Merrill will produce heirloom-quality photos for under $1,000. The photos compare favorably with the best DSLRs, but I can't imagine carrying around DSLR equipment when I travel so I think I made the right choice with the DP2M. I gave this 4 out of 5 stars because the Sigma is not perfect. Other reviewers have given details about the shortcomings, but the most noticeable deficiencies in my opinion are that the Sigma is not particularly good in low light and does not have image stabilization. A tripod is therefore needed more frequently than with other cameras. The Sigma is really best suited to patient people who can put up with minor inconveniences when taking a photo for results that would make artists take note. After owning this camera for 10 months, I can honestly say that if I were to lose it, I would not hesitate to buy another one over anything else currently on the market.", "Date": "May 27, 2013"}, {"Title": "Sigma dp 2 Merril", "Author": "Thad", "ReviewID": "RXQKI7SRV1R3I", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I love this camera, for some reason my review was put on the dp1 merril site, as I said on that review the resolution and colors in raw are outstanding.

My Dad and I shot his 4\"x5\" Speed Graphic when I was a kid. That experience makes you hungry for image quality and sharpness.

G.", "ReviewID": "R2QOMK8SKZ5TT4", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "The image quality is stupendous. 20\"x30\" prints are sharp, even when viewed close up. Most importantly the image is completely free of Bayer demosaicing artifacts. They are those funny color patterns you get in pictures of venetian blinds, or fine textured regions like gravel. Most people don't even know they are there, until they see an image from the Sigma and realize how much better an image is without them.  Even the best conventional DSLR's have these artifacts.To get a camera with truly equivalent image quality you really have to go up to a 40 Mpixel medium format camera, something like a Hasselblad. That will cost you $25,000 for a body and one lens.Many reviewers have complained about the ergonomics, in particular the slow writes to the SD card. Most of the time I haven't found this to be a problem, because the 7 frame buffer lets me take the next shot right away. This camera puts the controls I use all the time, aperture and exposure control, right at my fingertips. It's a pleasure to use.In good light the autofocus is dead on every time. The short battery life is a bit of a pain but the batteries are light so it's easy to carry extra.The lens shade is terrific as well, and worth getting. You can take pictures with the sun just outside the field of view with virtually no visible lens flare.There is no way I could go back to a conventional camera.", "Date": "May 20, 2013"}, {"Title": "This camera is nothing short of amazing", "Author": "T. Herzog", "ReviewID": "RMH9BPQHUQU1K", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "First let me say that I'm unsure what all the confusion over this camera stems from. I found the menu system fairly intuitive (or no less intuitive than my Fuji X-E1), the focusing moderately quick (again, not noticeably slower than my Fuji, which to be honest can't be considered fast. It's a snail compared to my Olympus OM-D E-M5, but everything is), and the general usability of the camera pretty good. It actually reminds me A LOT of my favorite film cameras of all time - Konica Hexar Silver. I miss that camera...but I digress. The Sigma DP2 Merrill is what it is - a camera that takes arguably the finest digital images of anything else on this planet. That's not hyperbole. In side by side comparisons the definition of images from the Merrill beats even the Leica M9 with it's renowned optics and full-frame sensor. Under extreme magnification (far beyond what any normal person would see on screen or printed enlargement) you can see individual grains of sand at the beach in a photo taken 10 feet away from the scene. I can't convey the detail capability of this sensor - it's out of this world. As for color rendition, I'd say it's fairly mild but can tend toward over-saturation in certain instances. Not anything I've not been able to fix in post production though. I actually prefer to shoot the Merrill in black and white as it's dynamic range is unparalleled.All that said, truth be told this camera isn't for everyone. It's not for moms chasing toddlers around, it's not for beginner photographers, it's not for your everyday joe who just wants a camera they can fit in their pocket. It's just not designed for those uses. What it's designed for is to be a light, packable, pro-level fixed-lens camera that makes SUPERB images.Pros of this camera (this will be a short list):1. IMAGE QUALITY. I can't state this enough. The fact that this camera beats $8,000 full-frame competitors in image quality says it all. You will actually say, \"Whoa...\" to yourself the first time you look at the files this camera puts out. This is honestly the only reason to buy this camera, but in the end isn't this what you're looking for - amazing images?2. Simplicity. Despite the cutting edge technology underneath the skin of the Merills, the controls and design of the camera's functionality can only be described as simplistic. In a very good way! One menu button, one rotating dial, only a handful of menus. I leave it on aperture-priority and the lowest ISO and adjust from there by just spinning the dial to set the desired aperture. I hate what Nikon and others have done to photography - do we really need 20 different layered menus, 5 rotating dials, and 15+ buttons on a camera? Ugh...I can only think of a few minor (to me) \"issues\" to note about to this camera. None of the below have caused me any problems and in no way dampen my 5-star review, but they are worth noting.1. The proprietary software. It sucks. If you shoot in RAW - which why wouldn't you with this camera, it shouldn't even have a JPG mode - you have to use this software to manage the files. It's tedious and slow, but luckily you just need to open the files and export to 16-bit TIFF, then you can then go to Lightroom for all post-production. All Merrill owners are just keeping their fingers crossed that some day Adobe will be able to add processing for the Foveon images...2. It's a battery hog. As in a very serious devourer of batteries. You'll get maybe 100 images per battery, meaning this is not intended as a \"shoot your heart out and pick and choose later\" type camera. Why Sigma didn't just make the battery twice as big and give the camera a grip is a mystery to me. I actually like this though - it's reminiscent of film and forces you to actually study and plan your images before pushing the button. They do give you two batteries to start, however I encourage you to buy at least 4 more. And an extra charger. Yes, seriously. But the batteries are cheap, likely because Sigma anticipated this being an issue.3. The grip. It doesn't have one, and as it comes these cameras aren't real ergonomic. There are multiple different grips available for the camera though, of which I recommend the Franiec version as it's perfectly designed, inexpensive, and simple. As I said, why the Merrills weren't given a grip and a larger battery to take up that extra space I will never understand.One last thing to note is that you don't want to skimp on memory cards. Buy good ones - like a couple of Sandisk Extreme 64 gig - because you'll want the storage space and you'll definitely want read/write speed (each image file is over 50 megabytes in RAW).All in all, if I'm only allowed to take one camera with me on a trip to Venice, let's say (I am going next summer), this would be the one I take. In fact, I'm considering buying the DP1 and DP3 as well so I have the perfect focal range for any shot with a simple, remarkable camera.", "Date": "June 27, 2013"}, {"Title": "This camera is not for the Masses.", "Author": "Lou Alcantar", "ReviewID": "R3JPHQJ488NGBS", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "If you are looking for a camera to do it all this not the camera you are looking for. Its auto focus will fail you, it can't zoom, it takes forever to process to card, you need to carry a pocket full of batteries, and sometimes the coulors are weird.So why did I buy this camera? I bought it because you can't beat the iQ at this price point. Also I like that this camera is kind of old school. In bright light the AF is okay but in low light you are better off pre-focusing manually. I also like that the software is fairly basic on the camera, the number of screens is just enough to get what you need done. It has been stated that this camera is kind of like a mf field camera without the bulk. The more I use it the more I agree.The size of this camera is also a plus. Fits in a coat pocket.

Otherwise, I'd recommend another camera.I tested this camera for a while, but ultimately returned it and got a used Canon 5d (Mark i/classic). The Sigma delivered amazingly detailed photos of indoor scenes (especially interior shots of historical buildings, etc.) and other scenes where texture is important (backlit flakes of snow on a snowfield) - it was as if you could run your hands over a piece of wood paneling 100 feet away, or read the contours of a snowdrift a hundred feet away. It's also very small and lightweight.However, I predominantly shoot landscape photography, and although it's a great camera for capturing details of tree branches, blades of grass, etc... it seems to achieve this at the expense of capturing the quality of light that's falling on these objects. Overall, the effect is similar to that of over-applying a sharpening filter in post-production, in my eyes. Maybe that's what you're looking for (especially in architectural photography, perhaps), but when you're trying to capture the ethereal essence of sunset on Mount Rainier, or the depth of a bluebird summer sky - this camera seems to render everything rather flat and lifeless, compared to my Canon 5d classic. Even after trying to equalize the photos in post-production, I couldn't coax any life out of the Sigma photos (and yes, they were processed with the clumsy Sigma RAW converter).Also, WARNING!!! - photos shot directly into the sun will have a rather unique lens flare: essentially a large field of multicolored circles, because of the nature of the Sigma's unique multi-layered sensor (I believe the Fuji X-trans sensor exhibits a similar effect). This was the biggest dealbreaker for me, since I shoot landscapes, and often wind up with the sun directly in the frame. Also, you have to buy a pocketful of batteries to get you through a large shoot.Although the lens is a nice length, I couldn't justify its price vs. a full-frame DSLR which lets you put any number of lenses on it (personally, I recommend vintage Olympus OM Zuiko lenses, which are a great deal if you don't mind manual exposures). Additionally, the number of accessories available is pretty small, and thus, expensive (i.e. grips, L-brackets, cases, lens hoods, etc.).So, I don't recommend this as a landscape photography camera, despite its small size.  But it could be a great architectural photography camera, or other use where capturing detail is essential and battery life isn't essential (and you don't mind spending extra time converting the RAW files in Sigma's software, since the JPEGs are horrible).", "Date": "January 3, 2014"}, {"Title": "Beautiful images!", "Author": "A.

While I knew DP2 was a sloooowwww camera I didn't expect four years later Sigma to struggle with the same problems and at $1000.My other gripe is the contrast. Way too much compared with the early models. I prefer the neutral colors and white balance from Dp2, DP2s. If you're in for the over saturated, over contrasty pictures then DP2M is for you.In low light focus is on par with the old models (slow), though not as noisy as the DP2.Battery life is fine if you shoot jpg, I only shoot raw and use SPP to convert in TIFF. Jpegs are usable compared with the previous versions.Update: after much use the conclusion is that the output makes up many times for the slow focus in low light.  I decided that I'd rather have a few great shots using this camera than a bunch of mediocre shots with others.The latest software has face detection (usable feature) and the posibility to shoot B&W; in raw. The B&W; raw can be reversed to color in SPP.Another update: one day by mistake I switched from RAW to jpeg FINE. On the LCD the pictures looked fine but something was missing, no detail, no sharpness. A couple of days later I uploaded the samples on my computer and realized the mistake. Anyway, once you see the RAW's the jpegs are a joke. No micro detail, sharpness or Merrill crispness. Dont bother with the jpegs if you have time to process the RAW's. For now I have to use SPP, convert in tiff and do the rest of processing in Phase One. I do this only if the shot is worth spending that much time in front of the computer. Most times SPP will do the job but I still have to use Phase One to convert from tiff to jpg. Sigmas jpg converter is poor even at the highest setting.
