My son has it, if you have a mac, you can't get the pictures off it, which makes it worthless.  I want my money back.", "Date": "November 27, 2010"}, {"Title": "Kind of lame", "Author": "Amazon Customer", "ReviewID": "R2W1STBLLBW4RS", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "I got this for my 6 y/o for Christmas since I got his big sisters digital cameras and he loves Sponge Bob.  I thought he'd be thrilled, but he was pretty disappointed after using it a few minutes and I can't blame him.  There's no flash, it's tiny and flimsy, there's no preview screen and you need the software to download pictures so he can only download pics on the computer he installed the software on.  He wants to take real pictures and this feels more like a toy than a camera.", "Date": "February 21, 2010"}, {"Title": "A nice gift for young child", "Author": "Jessica \"Jessica\"", "ReviewID": "R2YXP1QJTMF6GL", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I got this for my 2 year old daughter. The price was extemely low at the time and it seemed like a nice way of encouraging her interest in photography (she always steals MY camera; now she has one of her own!). The pictures are very bad/blurry. For her age this does not really matter, so I am happy with the product. It also came with editing software to put spongebob in your pictures, which I thoguht was a cute surprise.", "Date": "January 7, 2010"}, {"Title": "poor picture quality", "Author": "K.

It's a cute camera and she likes playing with it, but for a nine-year-old, better picture quality is a must.  I even tried adjusting the setting and it still looked very blurry.  Also, the software isn't super easy to use.  I would not reccomend this camera.  Spend just a little more and get a better camera.", "Date": "January 5, 2010"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": null, "Features": null, "Name": null, "ImgURL": null, "ProductID": "B001Y53USO"}}
