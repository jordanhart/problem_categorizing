Although totally made of plastic, it looks realistic enough (the \"lens\" is black and reflects some ambient light, like the glass of most cameras out there).When it detects moviment nearby, it moves in both directions (that is, it pans back and forth) a couple of times, as the red LED light blinks. It uses three \"AA\" batteries that can last for several months (assuming it is activated around 4 times a day). There's an ON/OFF switch outside. No wiring needed for installation (it has an actual white wire behind it, faking its insertion into the wall).The only reason I gave it 4 stars is that it doesn't react to movement everytime. Most times it works, but sometimes it just doesn't (as if it had an automatic on/off timer). But this is not a big issue because even without moving and blinking, it is still there and do intimidate intruders and thieves sucessfully (well, I hope so). Additionally, one of the 3 units I bought just don't move or blink at all.If you want a fake camera that really looks like an original surveillance camera, look for those models with the lens built-in inside a metal body, without movements, sounds or blinking LEDs.", "Date": "July 11, 2006"}, {"Title": "Fake security camera", "Author": "Anthony Covington \"Tony Covington\"", "ReviewID": "RSBL8JR72WCL3", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I first saw this product in the Spy Store, next to the Spy Museum in Washington DC - pity I hadn't bought one then and saved all the postage and packing to UK!  But worth the cost.  For a few pound/dollars you get a pretty authentic looking device, which whirrs and flashes its little red light as it scans from side to side after its motion detector has kicked in.  Battery powered, so cost effective.  Clearly only a minor deterrent to committed intruders, but a very useful one at that.  I like it, because it has all the appearances of the real thing, at a fraction of the cost - and probably just as effective, although I cannot confirm that.

I had to have the police come out due to some problems with my neighbors parking their car in front of my driveway and/or mailbox. When they came out, we were talking about the ongoings of my culdesac in general and he asked me why do I have all the cameras. He thought they were real. Granted, I have very high ceilings. So even the one over my front door is way up high. So you can't really get a good look close-up. But he thought they were real. And I know others have said you have to be pretty close to set off the motion sensor. I have had the opposite experience. The camera is AT LEAST 10 feet up and it still detects every person that comes to my front door.I think it is worth the price! Hey, it is all in the perception. I am sure some professional thief can probably figure it out. But most of the issues in my neighborhood, which have been very few, are being done by teenagers who are all about getting in and getting out quick. So I just can only hope that they won't bother with messing with my house if they have to sit there and wonder if the cameras are real or not. Has worked so far! I do have other deterrents like locks on my gate, \"beware of the dog\" signs on my fence, many landscape lights, home alarm system, etc. Again, hopefully it just makes it too much of a pain to mess with my house. And with neighbors that do not have a single light on at night and leave their garages wide open all the time, etc - all I can do is try my best to make thieves think I have security cameras that will catch them in the act.", "Date": "August 20, 2010"}, {"Title": "Pitiful", "Author": "B.

Even as a simple joke, it's pretty fun to mess around, like putting in a bathroom or something. ;)The main downside is that in the company's attempt to please the customer, they added an on and off switch...Why would you put an on and off switch on a security camera?.. Also the port to take the battery out hides behind no set of screws and can easily be turned off by a thief. (or girl), as if it wasn't easy to take off the wall to begin with.
