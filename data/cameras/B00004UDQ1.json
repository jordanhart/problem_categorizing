{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Great product with great features! but...", "Author": "\"no_x\"", "ReviewID": "R3KVJ70NU5G4HU", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I bought the S70 about two months ago and I shot a lot of pictures with it: its light weight, compact size and ease of use even with one hand (the  right of course :) ) make the perfect digital camera for ME. I was really  impressed by the quality of its pictures (colors, shades, contrast...)  although I've read a pretty bad review about it in a magazine. As many  other digital cameras, there are many features such as crop/resize a  picture, choose between 6 different resolutions, zoom in a picture (to look  for a specific detail for instance), USB connection to your PC (which is a  lot faster), optical and digital zoom (even though I don't recommend using  the digital one unless you're perfectly still), several effects (sepia,  black and white, solarize, negative and two or three others), a viewfinder  with a focus ring (very convenient at night, believe me, you can't see  anything using the LCD display)... you can even shoot a movie with it! Why  only 4 stars ? Simply because it comes with a 8Mo memory stick (come on  Sony! we can't do anything with 8Mo unless we use the 640x480 resolution!),  there is no carrying case or something to protect it and the menu is not  that intuitive... it can get pretty complicated to find what you're looking  for when you don't know your camera. However, it's still very easy to  use... turn it on, point and shoot... delete if you're not satisfied and  try again! Want to have a look at your pictures ? Turn a switch to  \"play mode\" and use the arrows of a small pad to navigate among  them, delete, resize... then just plug your USB connector to your PC and  with the driver installed, a removable disk appears on your machine, just  like a zip drive or a hard drive! Drag and drop your pictures where you  want. The stamina rechargeable battery allows you to know exactly how much  time you have. In short, I think the S70 is worth the price you pay for it  even if you'll have to buy another memory stick (around $140 for a 64Mo but  you can go with a 32Mo). It has all the features of the other digital  cameras of its range of prices plus others, the quality of the picture is  commendable (and again I'm not talking about the 3.3 megapixels resolution  which is obviously excellent but the colors, contrast...) and it's easy to  use, except for the menu. I've used it in trade shows, parties with  friends, during weekends (sceneries...), I've even taken some pictures from  a plane! Last but not least, even if I print a lot of pictures with this  camera, using a pretty good Epson printer (but not a photo printer, no need  for it), I still have a good 35mm when I want to have a professional  result. That makes sense, doesn't it?", "Date": "July 24, 2000"}, {"Title": "A great all-around digital camera", "Author": "Ernest Kim \"An Average Joe\"", "ReviewID": "R2S1JJX3B01PFL", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "If you're looking for a digital camera that will give you film level quality (3.3 megapixels of data capture) in an easy to use, compact package, the Sony DSC-S70 is a great choice.  Not only does it take wonderful pictures in a variety of settings, but it also comes with a lot of small, easy to forget about features that add up to a great overall usage experience and that make the camera a much better real value than most of its competitors.Some of these include an internal, rechargeable Lithium Ion battery that shows you, in minutes, how much more time you have left before recharging is required, a built in USB port (no external cradles are required), all required cables, a built in memory stick slot and included memory stick (although the included 8MB stick is too small, you should definitely pick up at least a 32MB stick), and an AC adapter included (believe it or not, a lot of digital cameras don't come with an AC adapter and since digicams eat up batteries this really makes a big difference).These types of small things are often overlooked in reviews, but in long-term, real-world use, they really do make a difference.The only negatives that I've experienced are things that other reviewers have mentioned, the included memory stick is too small and the camera does not come with a carrying case, which you should definitely get if you plan on traveling with the camera.Some quick notes, while the camera works flawlessly with both Windows 98 and MacOS based computers, a Windows 2000 driver does not yet seem to be available.", "Date": "October 10, 2000"}, {"Title": "Best digital camera I have owned", "Author": "A.

Every thing good/bad about this camera has already been said here so I would like to cover a couple other features not mentioned - some of these notes are mine, others from WWW sites and newsgroup posts.The one second shutter delay can be somewhat shortened by half depressing the shutter button. The S-70 will the autofocus, which makes up most of the shutter lag. When you then press down the button all the way you'll find it will almost instantly take the picture. Several other techniques can be used to minimize the delay: 1) go to manual focus, 2) go to AE mode, 3) go to manual WB - the less auto, the faster the camera.MPEG recording for 60 seconds. I would like to correct one reviewer regarding making videos with this camera - If you switch to the smaller resolution, and hold down the shutter button, you will get a minute of video. This is the max though. The camera has to store the raw video in internal memory, then convert it to mpeg and write it to the memory stick. The camera can only fit 15 seconds of large resolution video, and 60 seconds of small resolution video in the internal memory. There is no way to get more than this much video. OR.. reduce the size to 160 x 120 and  get 1 minute per segment.EXIF information - data is automatically imbedded into the file when saved in the camera. The data includes the time and date the picture was taken, but also all information on the f-stop used, program mode chosen, shutter speed, flash utilisation and more. Much of this information can be seen by opening the image in MGI PhotoSuite (the version that came with your camera--or a later version) and selecting \"Image Information\" under the Image menu. If you choose to keep the information after downloading to your computer, you must ensure that the original is kept ( if you save the jpg file as something else, you lose the exif information). You can RENAME the file, but opening it and saving or modifying it in any way will lose the info.I use Photoshop to edit and crop files, but always save as the PSD photoshop native format, which keeps the original jpg file untouched. I also chose the \"serial\" numbering option on the camera, which allows the memory stick contents to be moved to the PC in the same folder without having the \"file exists\" problem. (It carries on automatically with DSC00678.jpg etc, rather than going back to DSC0001.jpg every time a new stick is inserted or reused).", "Date": "October 19, 2000"}, {"Title": "Totally  Fascinated", "Author": "Bryce  E.

The  ability to trim and enlarge a pic in the camera before downloading into the  computer is only one of the many fascinating features of this camera.  I  also purchased a Sony floppy disc adaptor for the Memory Stick making it  easy to use with most any computer.

Oh", "ReviewID": "R3JA1WX7X009GS", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I considered and compared digital cameras that were pricier than the S70.  However, the S70 earned my money because of its image quality, ease of use, and USB connectivity.In the past, Sony built good cameras with  innovative features; however, the image quality has always been suspect in  the minds of aspiring photo amateurs and professionals.  With the DSC-S70,  Sony got it right!One of the reasons that older Sony digital cameras had  mediocre image quality was because of their mediocre lenses.  Sony knew  this; so, they found someone who was really good at making lenses: Carl  Zeiss.  For me, the most impressive feature of this camera is the 21 mm  Carl Zeiss, Vario-Sonnar lens.  I've used and admired Zeiss optics for many  years in film photography.  This lens yields excellent resolution, coupled  with brilliant colors.  Lesser lenses yield images with a focused center;  however, the edges and corners would not be as sharp.  Not with this camera  -- every pixel is clear and the details are impressive for even the most  discerning eyes.Another reason that I got this camera is because of the  wide variety of apertures and shutter speeds.  The aperture ranges from  f/2.0 to f/8.0 and the shutter speed can vary from 8 to 1/1000 seconds.  Although the S70 doesn't feature a full manual exposure mode, you get a  reasonable degree of control.At the time I got this camera, Sony only  offered Windows 95 & 98 drivers.  I'm delighted that Sony now offers  support for Windows 2000.  Installation was a breeze.  You can find the  Win2K drivers here on Sony's site ...The battery life is  pretty good.  On a full charge, you can take roughly 2 hours worth of use.  The battery meter is pretty accurate, which indicates the number of minutes  remaining.  Although the memory stick technology is proprietary, it's easy  to use and very convenient.  The 8 MB memory stick that comes with the  camera is pathetic.  You need more to take many high resolution pictures,  preferably the 64 MB, which is the Sony's largest to date.  Rumor has it  that Sony is making a 128 MB version of their popular memory stick -- way  cool!  I would recommend getting an extra battery and a 64 MB memory stick  -- using the 8MB memory stick as an emergency only backup.Good luck, and  have fun with your new S70!", "Date": "August 16, 2000"}, {"Title": "Very good camera overall", "Author": "\"hssyed\"", "ReviewID": "R1M592KRR7O9G8", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I read the reviews (both in magazines and online forums) and have to say  this camera is quite good.

The  pictures are very impressive - excellent resolution with vibrant colors!  I  am having a blast with the movie feature - excellent for e-mails.

The DSC-S70 met both our requirements. We've had the camera for about four months and are still very satisfied.Some good things about the camera: The pictures are great. Printed on an Epson 2500 they look photo quality. The Info lithium battery goes forever and is quick to recharge. The LCD display controls are easy to learn. Lot's of flexibility in recording and exposure modes if you care to operate other than automatic. The video playback, both pictures and video clips, is straight forward and works well.Some things to think about: The included 8MB memory stick is too small. I ended up buying two 64MB sticks, and at about $120 each I think they're too spendy, but then so is SmartMedia and Flash. If you have any other Sony products that use memory sticks it takes some of the sting out of buying extra memory. The delay when the camera 'sets up the exposure' (shutter button part way down) takes some getting used to. Picture processing time at the highest resolution is about half a second so there's no 'rapid fire' picture taking.If you're a Windows 2000 user you'll have to get the USB drivers from Sony's website.

The same goes for the memory stick, you really need to invest in the larger capacity memory sticks, I found a need for 3 when on vacation.Problems: The LCD is hard to read in bright sunlight (common to all) but you still have an eye viewer - that's good. Next there is a delay time between pressing the shutter and the actual taking of the picture (you get used to this) and secondly the recycle time between pictures is a few seconds, so rapid fire shooting is not possible.I have also switched this camera to \"black and white\" mode for outdoor scenery shots and it works very well. With easily obtainable software, like Adobe Photo Shop, you can change the contrast and brightness easily for more striking effects. When taking normal color photos you can also enhance contrast and colors to enhance or exaggerate for some great \"artistic\" effects.

Some shadow areas or low light photos cause chromatic aberrations. The worst camera problem however is the over-saturation of primary colors especially red. What at first may appear, as a vibrant color upon closer inspection really is an unnatural boost of certain colors in the camera's processing algorithm.  This occurs to the point of eliminating detail and subtleties.But my biggest complaint is not the camera but Sony. I have had the s70 since July 00' and attempted to find the one basic item/accessory that any camera owner with common sense would want - a filter for lens protection.  The camera requires an adapter to attach ANY filter or lens. Not only could I not find this basic accessory anywhere on the net but also Sony has yet to fill my 2 Month+ order. To add to the frustration the filters were available immediately and have sat collecting dust for two months. The point here is 1) Manufacturers need to stop releasing products without simultaneously making available the basic items that are necessary to make the products useful - a 3 month wait is too long. 2) It seems that for some reason with digital cameras both retail and e-com stores while selling a wide variety of camera brands carry very few supplies/accessories for these same products. 3) Basic items should be included in the kit.

I absolutely love my DSC-S70 and recommend it to anyone that is interested in getting a digital camera.  I have not had any troubles with my DSC-S70.  The only real problem I had was finding 64 MB Memory Sticks since none of the local stores had gotten them in yet.  I had to settle for 2 32 MB ones.  But since each one is equivalent to a roll of 35 mm film when you use the highest JPEG setting, it wasn't really a problem.  I only took one bad picture during the entire vacation, and that was because my brother bumped in to me when I pressed the shutter and I didn't notice it until later.  Although I felt that the 8 MB Memory Stick was a little small, I'd rather pay for the little bit of memory that I actually need than pay for the memory that I will never use.  I may have needed 64 MB for my trip to London, but in most cases, I'll never need to take more than 8 MB with me.  Sony also gives you a ... gift certificate for its online store if you register your camera online.  If you use this gift certificate towards another 8 MB stick, it will only cost you ..., giving you the same amount of memory that all the other cameras give.  And now, I think they give you ... back if you buy a memory stick with the camera.  I found the MPEG performance to be quite pleasing, especially in the HQ mode.

I've owned five already including the Olympus D-400, D-450 and C-3030.  I think the Olympus C-3030 is very high quality but requires four PhD's to learn how to use it.  I am not an amateur.  I've taught photography and I've built 15 different computer systems over the years.  I am a professional in presentation software, for example.  The Olympus C-3030 was an expensive disappointment.  This Sony camera has great optics and --- once you spend a little time learning it --- an extremely simply menu system!  I can take pictures of clients and rapidly download them and embed them into a Powerpoint presentation.  Others have noted the flaws: the USB cable is simply 'not ready for prime time' and the 8mb memory stick is a joke.  So: if you want a great digital camera (that can do excellent 5-15 second video clips--- something I really need) then get this camera and a PCMCIA adapter [and] an extra battery and two 64mb memory sticks [and] you'll have a great system to use.  Toss the USB cable and write a letter of complaint to Sony for not providing the PCMCIA adapter.  The attached unlosable lens cap is a good idea, but an automatically hidable one (as on some other cameras) would have been better.  Including all the goodies and a case in one 'kit' would have been smart and should have been done at the same price.  Putting the microphone in front instead of on top would have been a good idea, too.  Letting the user record 60 second video clips would have been great, too. But as a usable high quality system: I currently haven't found a better one.  And as a tool to photograph the misbehaviors of neighborhood vandals, it's been proving to be a godsend.

I was really  impressed by the quality of its pictures (colors, shades, contrast...)  although I've read a pretty bad review about it in a magazine. As many  other digital cameras, there are many features such as crop/resize a  picture, choose between 6 different resolutions, zoom in a picture (to look  for a specific detail for instance), USB connection to your PC (which is a  lot faster), optical and digital zoom (even though I don't recommend using  the digital one unless you're perfectly still), several effects (sepia,  black and white, solarize, negative and two or three others), a viewfinder  with a focus ring (very convenient at night, believe me, you can't see  anything using the LCD display)... you can even shoot a movie with it! Why  only 4 stars ? Simply because it comes with a 8Mo memory stick (come on  Sony! we can't do anything with 8Mo unless we use the 640x480 resolution!),  there is no carrying case or something to protect it and the menu is not  that intuitive... it can get pretty complicated to find what you're looking  for when you don't know your camera. However, it's still very easy to  use... turn it on, point and shoot... delete if you're not satisfied and  try again! Want to have a look at your pictures ? Turn a switch to  \"play mode\" and use the arrows of a small pad to navigate among  them, delete, resize... then just plug your USB connector to your PC and  with the driver installed, a removable disk appears on your machine, just  like a zip drive or a hard drive! Drag and drop your pictures where you  want. The stamina rechargeable battery allows you to know exactly how much  time you have. In short, I think the S70 is worth the price you pay for it  even if you'll have to buy another memory stick (around $140 for a 64Mo but  you can go with a 32Mo). It has all the features of the other digital  cameras of its range of prices plus others, the quality of the picture is  commendable (and again I'm not talking about the 3.3 megapixels resolution  which is obviously excellent but the colors, contrast...) and it's easy to  use, except for the menu. I've used it in trade shows, parties with  friends, during weekends (sceneries...), I've even taken some pictures from  a plane! Last but not least, even if I print a lot of pictures with this  camera, using a pretty good Epson printer (but not a photo printer, no need  for it), I still have a good 35mm when I want to have a professional  result.
