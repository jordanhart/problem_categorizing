I was looking for an inexpensive way to get remote access.  There are a lot of good DVR's out in the market, but its the software and the service that really make the difference.  I have limited tech. knowledge and I was concerned that I would not be able to set up the remote access.  Sure enough I got the unit hooked up no problem, but could not get remote access to work.  I found out that Swann has 24 hour a day 7 day a week free tech. support.  I called them up and within 30 minutes they had my remote access and mobile view all set up for me.  Everything is working great.  I could not be happier with the DVR and the customer service.", "Date": "March 31, 2013"}, {"Title": "swann communications 4 channel dvr with network and 3g capabable model SWDVR-42600H", "Author": "Carlton G.
