I have a rebel XSI and a 7D and let me tell you that I am now ruined by the T4I's flip out articulating touch screen and has become my \"Go to\" camera for any different composure shots and of course video !As for the stats of these you can find them anywhere on the net and reviews as well.This kit is an excellent addition to any photographers arsenal or just by its self.Also there are a few(as of this date) specifically made lenses just for this rebel. No other rebel has had this.So....have fun shooting!", "Date": "March 4, 2013"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": "$1,299.00", "Features": "Includes <b>EF-S 18-135mm IS STM Zoom Lens</b> & <b>EF-S 55-250mm f/4.0-5.6 IS II Zoom Lens</b>\n18.0 Megapixel CMOS (APS-C) sensor and DIGIC 5 Image Processor\n3.0-inch Vari-angle Clear View Touch Screen LCD\nEnhanced EOS Full HD Movie Mode with Movie Servo AF\nAlso features: 14-bit A/D Conversion; 5 FPS continuous shooting; ISO 100-12800 and expandable to 25600 in H mode; new Hybrid CMOS AF; built-in stereo microphone; manual audio level adjustment; Video Snapshot feature; Scene Intelligent Auto mode; Handheld Night Scene mode... and more!", "Name": "Canon EOS Rebel T4i Digital SLR Camera Body & EF-S 18-135mm IS STM Lens with EF-S 55-250mm f/4.0-5.6 IS II Zoom Lens", "ImgURL": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51zwF89RdiL._SY300_.jpg", "ProductID": "B0092PLU8U"}}
