The glass filters were back ordered, shipping manifest was the only indication of them missing.  But they arrived just a couple of days later. The Camera body, all lenses, and accessories are new and in perfect condition.  Memory card is fast and camera can take pictures very quickly and record HD video with no issues.  Extra Battery holds charge and takes just as many pictures as the OEM.  The 2x telephoto lens works great on the 18-55mm lens, the edges of the image distorts on the 75-300mm  especially when all the way zoomed. The bag holds everything nice and neat and the tripod even has a carry bag for it which is nice. Placing the camera on the tripod and using the remote I am able to take many family pictures without having to run back and forth to the camera saves lots of time especially dealing with little ones and pets..Great product and price. Excellent shipping, I highly recommend to anyone looking to get a awesome DSLR camera with all the accessories needed for most shooting conditions.", "Date": "January 31, 2014"}, {"Title": "GREAT GREAT GREAT", "Author": "Jim B.", "ReviewID": "R2GHSQHU6WWL4O", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This is the most complete kit for the T5i I found on the net. I'm still trying to get familiar with the t5I and numerous accessories in the kit but am very happy with the purchase so far.  The two main lenses are Canon (very happy) while the 2.5 teli and .45 wide are aftermarket (which is ok with me).  The tripod is light weight and has two levels.

The camera is awesome and you get a lot of things. Not sure these are all items that are really needed. Be careful, because I did not get everything as pictured. The SD card holder is just a plastic holder that will not hold up. The camera bag is cheap and the zipper broke after 3 days and I have already replaced it with a canon bag that is awesome. The card reader was not the one pictured. The tripod is okay, but I will be upgrading it also. The zoom lens is not an auto focus lens. Which means if you are going to use this lens, be prepared to use it with a tripod. If not, the shots can be inconsistent and blur very easily. Make no mistakes about it, this lens is known as the bargain zoom lens. Overall this is a good deal and it is a great camera. Good Starter bundle but you will need many upgrades. May be better off just purchasing the better stuff to start with.", "Date": "May 20, 2014"}, {"Title": "Camera, 300mm Lens, Flash Okay.", "Author": "Paulo Pinheiro", "ReviewID": "R2K37Z8L57AXNF", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "This whole deal is okay.

Camera and all lenses have all performed to my expectations. The only reason that I did not give it a 5 star rating was because of the tri-pod that was part of the package. I love the functionality of the tri-pod and everything about it, however the pin at the top that holds the mounting plate was really weak and broke after only a couple of uses. Everything else in the package arrived in good condition and has performed to my expectations and above.
