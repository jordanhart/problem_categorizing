The image quality is better than anything I've seen in it's price range. Then, I spent a moderately windy, but not particularly dusty, day taking photos of the new Graf Zeppelin at Moffet Field. Ever since, there have been several tiny spots of dust that have gotten on the inside of the lens. They create an indelible ghost image, most noticeable on pictures with blue sky background, and especially when the lens is zoomed out. No amount of blowing inside the camera and outside the lens  managed to eliminate the dust, although it did move around. Then, this weekend, I took video out of the sunroof of my car while driving over the Golden Gate bridge at about 40 mph. At the scenic overlook, I took pictures, and the results were very disappointing, as more dust had entered. Any camera that cannot keep dust out of the lens in a 40 MPH wind in a non-dusty environment is worthless, IMHO. I am not paying $150 for Sony to clean it, since it will just do it again. I am going to try to take it apart myself. If it ruins it, oh well. It is ruined already by Sony's defective design.Update: Three hours of surgery-like precise disassembly, cleaning, and reassembly produced success. No more dust, no more shadowy spots. Alas, only a couple months later, despite consciously protecting the camera from windy/dusty conditions, dust has once again begun to produce the shadowy spots. There is no way to make a silk purse out of this sows ear.Update #2 (1/26/13): Since my last update, I've had to disassemble and clean the sensor a couple more times. I've got the entire procedure down to an hour! If this camera didn't take such stunning pictures, I wouldn't bother. But I don't want to jump onto the ever-increasing megapixel war bandwagon with a new camera, which only gobbles up hard drive space and bogs down file transfers and editing.Also recently, the battery door developed a crack over one of the two battery contacts. which I had to epoxy with JB Weld. My older Sony camera had a dedicated flip-open door for memory card access, separate from the batteries. When I bought the DSC-W5, I predicted that with the constant battery door opening/closing with pressure applied every time the memory card needs removing, that the door would break. And it finally did.", "Date": "March 21, 2009"}, {"Title": "Reliable little camera", "Author": "matthew_schuster@yahoo.com \"Matthew S.\"", "ReviewID": "R2L5YA34TCP2C3", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "Bought this camera years and years ago and it's still working.  Takes nice point and shoot pictures, but does eat up batteries and storage space when taking movies.  Decent resolution on images, audio not so great for the movies.  One of the reasons I bought a second camera as this one only has a 3x Optical zoom.  So its good for relatively close pictures (say across the street), but not so good for distance shots (like a bird flying overhead.)  I do take this camera with me to parties and such as it's a lot easier to carry than the bigger ones with the higher optical zooms.  This would make a good beginner camera for someone.", "Date": "August 28, 2011"}, {"Title": "Love this camera", "Author": "L.

I have not taken any time to figure out anything tricky with it, just point and shoot! This little camera has been all over the place with my family and we have taken some great photos with it.
