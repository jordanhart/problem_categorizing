{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Fuji J28, a simple camera for the budget-minded person", "Author": "Yarii", "ReviewID": "R2YIWRPS8W0XOG", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "My first digital camera was a Fuji 2 MP bought in October 2004 - I still own that camera and it works great, but -- I love this new Fuji Finepix J28 even more, but only for the simplicity of use this camera affords.If you like manual settings on a camera, you will not be happy with this camera.  This camera is for the person who is looking for a simple-to-use point & shoot camera. In the Manual Mode, you can only change the ISO setting (from 100 to 3200), exposure value and white balance--that's it.In my opinion, the Fuji FinePix J28 goes head-to-head with the Canon Powershot A480, (which I ordered previously and returned) the Canon being a little more expensive, although prices can vary day to day. Canon PowerShot A480 10 MP Digital Camera with 3.3x Optical Zoom and 2.5-inch LCD (Black)The Fuji pictures are more color saturated and sharper in general, but the Canon A480 takes better close-up (macro) shots.  You are able to get closer to your subject with the Canon, so if you are solely wanting to take close-up pictures, I think the Canon may be a better choice for you.If you play around with the J28, you will be able to get some halfway decent MACRO shots.  Look at some of my pictures I have uploaded and you can see the difference between the watch shot at 5 MP from 4 inches away and the coin shot at 10 MP from farther and then cropped.  I get my best macro shots from setting the resolution to 10MP Fine, and holding the camera at least 6 inches away from the subject, then cropping it.  Otherwise, they turn out pretty bad.However, for all-around picture taking of vacations, pets, people, and everything else, this Fuji J28 is superior for the following reasons:1. The lithium-ion battery is longer lasting than AA alkaline batteries.  I was able to take 224 pictures before the battery needed recharging.2. J28's colors are brighter and more saturated.3. The J28 LCD screen is slightly larger.4. SR-Auto - (Scene Recognition Auto) Just leave it on this setting and you can't help but take a good picture.5. Flash recycling time is MUCH shorter with the J28 than the A480 - recycling time is the number of seconds after a flash picture has been taken before the camera is ready to take another picture.6. You can use the optical zoom while recording a movie with the J28.  With most cheaper point & shoot cameras, you cannot use the zoom. But you must set the zoom before you start recording, it cannot be changed during recording.7. The menus and buttons are more intuitive with the J28.8. The plastic body of the Fuji J28 seems to be more durable. Just one complaint:  The shiny body shows every fingerprint!Older and more technically challenged people should have no trouble using this camera. On the same note, this is perfect for younger kids too, due to the price. Just set the menu to SR-Auto and six different scenes will be recognized automatically:  Landscape, Portrait, Nightlit Portrait, Backlit Portrait, Night, and Macro. You don't have to do a thing but press the shutter halfway to focus, then once the focus is locked, press the button all the way down.I've taken over 200 pictures with no blurry ones yet.  My hands aren't the steadiest and I have 3 cats that won't hold still and pose for me, yet every picture of them has been perfect with this camera.If I could find something to complain about - and I think this may have to do with the price point of this camera - I would love to have a dial on top to access the settings instead of having to go through the menu.  Also, I'm really disappointed that Fuji can't come up with better photo editing software than what they supply with their cameras, it hasn't changed much at all since 2004 (Picasa is better).  But these are my only complaints, and not enough to warrant a reduction in stars in my rating.I've uploaded some photos taken with this camera, please check them out!", "Date": "October 20, 2009"}, {"Title": "I love my J28", "Author": "Katie's Dad", "ReviewID": "RBSA1OYW6ZY70", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I received my Fuji J28 a couple of day ago and I love it!  I decided to buy it over the Canon A480 because the J28 is WAY thinner and also takes a rechargeable battery.  This is the perfect camera for me because the camera has a mode called SR-Auto which will automatically detect 6 different scenes.  It can detect if I take a photo of my kids, a flower or landscape.  I love to hike and the small size makes it east to carry in my pocket.  My photos are very sharp and colorful.This is one of the easiest cameras that I have ever owned because there are only a few buttons on the back and the menu is very intuitive.  There are many advanced features available if you know how to use them.I have already taken over 100 pictures over the last couple of days and I haven't had to recharge the battery.Overall I am very happy with my purchase.  The features and feel and look of the J28 remind me of a more expensive camera.  I would definitely recommend this camera.", "Date": "October 9, 2009"}, {"Title": "Great little camera for the value", "Author": "Laura B", "ReviewID": "R2UJSTJ7BLE8S3", "Overall": "4.0", "Content":

The first thing I noticed about this camera was how light it is.  It barely weighs anything, so putting it in my pocket doesn't weigh my pants down.  It is also nice and small and doesn't feel bulky when in my pocket.  Out of the box it is quick and easy to use.Pros:(1) Easy to use.  The Scene Recognition Mode (SR) makes it completely auto--no switching around to landscape or auto mode, etc. while shooting.(2) Light.  I don't think I've used a digital camera that is this light before.  Even my other cameras with li-ion batteries are heavier.(3) Value.  This is a great price for a good camera.Cons:(1) The SR mode can make it a little difficult to focus in macro mode.  I tried taking pictures of flowers and it had trouble focusing.  Switching to macro mode worked fine.(2) Panoramic mode.  In this mode you take 3 pictures to get one long one--you need to line each picture up on the view screen with the previous one you took. I couldn't see on the view screen well enough to match up the edged of each photo to create a good panoramic picture.  They all ended up a bit off.  (seen the video for examples)(3) The battery compartment lid opened while I was using the camera.  The latch seems to be a little too easy to open and because my thumb was positioned right on top of it I would inadvertently open it while taking pictures.(4) Switching between modes is a pain.  There is no quick switch button--you must go through the menu to change modes.  A little bit of a pain for me, especially when switching between video and still photos.The video shows its size and a few pictures of it.  I also took a number of pictures in my back yard and while sailing.  I took this camera out with me on our sailboat (an Ultimate 20--a 20' racing boat) during a regatta in the San Francisco Bay and it held up very well.  I didn't get it wet, but it stayed in my pocket while I was bounced around, knocked over halfway into the water, and jumped back and forth on the boat.  I took a short video of us racing to get an idea of the quality--both video and sound.I would recommend this camera to anyone looking for a less expensive, decent digital camera.  It is simple and easy to use for basic shots.  I don't think it is good for someone who is an experienced photo-taker (I'm not saying photographer because I mean someone who is an everyday person who takes lots of pictures of everything).  For the price, though, it is a great entry-level digital camera.", "Date": "October 25, 2009"}, {"Title": "Meet my new BFF", "Author": "C. Scanlon \"least helpful reviewer\"", "ReviewID": "RZV8KXLG37BBM", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "For over a quarter century I have done photography for publication, including in the war zone of Nicaragua in the time of Reagan.My grandfather was a news photographer, who taught my mother to use the old Speedgraphics 5x7 format outdoors. He did Yellowstone and Mount Rushmore and the Grand Canyon with her long before those were way overdone. He kept a darkroom in the basement I would crawl around.When I was in Nicaragua we used SLR's, mainly manual as that was all that there was, and did black and white darkroom work in the sweltering heat. The preferred camera body back then was the Nikon of course (I had a Canon). The preferred film was Fuji, not Kodak, especially for color slide work (slide, uh, you might not understand that if you're under a quarter century . . .).I had started off with a Kodak Instamatic as a little kid, even a Brownie maybe, learning the basic rules we still must use such as: Keep the sun behind you (although this J28 provides for that if you ask it), fill your frame, the Law of Thirds (which this J28 can easily display at the push of a button - keeping things straight in your frame and at the juncture of the Thirds where they belong, once focus is locked in) - etc., the old golden rules which still apply today, and I went through photography classes from high school through college.This J28 is the best thing I have met, and already was provided me with publishable shots. Of course in today's market I manage to remain obstinately, even proudly, \"often published; never paid.\" And to remain in the war zones.This thing is smaller than a pack of Raleighs, and half as thin, and yet has more power than any camera I have met, within its limitations. And it is intuitive.For instance last Friday before Sunset I was standing at a public service with a few hundred people near the main plaza of a small village in Mexico, a community I have lived with about five years, so they know me. A young girl standing on a fence watching the event I knew to be an observant, thoughtful, capable person with whom I have never actually spoken, but I knew she is bright. And she had the best angle for taking pictures of the crowd, and what was happening in the middle. All I did was hand her this J28. All she did was ask how to zoom in and out (like she knew about that!). And she took the best pictures I have seen, without reading the manual first.I did not trust the digital zoom based on experience with other such \"point and shoot\" DSLR's which once you pass the point of optical zoom simply blows up the available pixels, making the result blurry. The young girl did not back away, but zoomed away with the digital zoom, and in this J28 the results are NOT blurry, but luminous, in that light of dusk, and crystal clear and crisp.I would have been afraid to take a shot like that, wary of the results, but she went ahead and did it and the results are great.What a camera.This camera by the way comes in a very \"green\" package, with very minimal plastic except for the heavy duty indestructible stuff around the 2GB SDcard that comes included. I quickly ordered of course a standard sized SanDisk 8GB Ultra II 15MB/s SDHC SD Card Class 4 (SDSDH-008G-P36, Retail Packaging) which this camera had no compatibility problems writing and reading. As part of the \"green\" the camera comes with a manual on disk, multi-lingual, as well as updates included in print. Lacking a home computer, I printed out the nearly one hundred page manual twice, once blown up to full sheet size. There is more here than you can possibly imagine. It's like your cellphone (I don't know; I don't have one of this generation!); far more features than you will ever actually learn.But this is worth learning. I started out setting everything to AUTO, including flash. Adjusting the flash is very simple for situations in which you either want to force the flash or suppress it entirely (my usual situation - and since this camera can go out to ISO 3200, not merely 1600 - who needs flash!), by just hitting the circle dial right. You can do the same for macro, hitting the dial to the left. Now I have progressed to Scene Recognition, which includes automatic macro, as well as night scenes, landscape, portrait, etc. I hope to have sufficient mastery of this marvelous machine to go to the Manual mode, but prefer for now to trust the on-board sensors. WHO has time to set up the camera before snapping a shot out here in the real world anyway?But I keep studying the Fine Manual in the meantime. It's like going back to school, and is worth it, because this is a darn good camera, and has far more too offer than you could possibly imagine.My greatest struggle fo course with those old manual SLR's a quarter century ago was focus. We would try to cheat by deepening the depth of field, but that made for other compromises. This camera focuses itself, accurately, and has incredible depth of field from front to back. In the old days we thought it very artistic to have only the main subject in focus with the background and foreground out of focus, a minimal depth of field. This camera produces images sharp from front to back.And it has a Face Recognition focus feature. You can watch on the rear display the process of focusing, and can tell when the camera has found a face somewhere in the frame; a green square goes around it. The camera will focus upon that face (or faces) and not lose it (unless of course you choose to turn off the face recognition feature. This is incredible. Where was this a quarter century ago?In fact this camera quickly sets up and shoots. Candid shots are a breeze. Point and shoot. And continuous shots are possible. Time between shots is no more than a few seconds otherwise, normally.It is so small I can slip it into a pocket and no one knows. That is what I need most. I carry it wrapped in a handkerchief and slipped into one of those name tag pouches they pass out at professional conventions. My dream is to go to an optometrist in Mexico and beg for a large metal eyeglasses case to keep it in. Those things are nearly bulletproof and that is just about what I need. Meanwhile the ID pouch is great, and has room for an extra SD card.Normally my gear would also include a set of AA lithium batteries, but another part of the \"green\" aspect of this camera is that it has a rechargeable battery. This does help keep the camera thinner than a AA battery, but I would hate to lose that charger cord. To charge you plug the cord into the tiny USB port in the camera, and then into the wall. A Red light comes on the back of the camera. When it is charged, the light goes out.The rear display uses the image of a AA battery to indicate present state of power, with little wedges to show how much power is left. I was concerned when the first wedge went out, and wasn't sure whether you had to completely discharge the battery before recharging, or leave the dreaded false memory in the battery. I went for it and recharged, and it seems to have no ill effects.I was able to take hundreds of shots and review and delete, etc., before the battery went low, but this was only a few days. I think the lithiums last longer in the other camera, but I will just have to be attentive to this. I fear losing the rechargeable battery (very small, very thin) or the charger cord, knowing how I am. Also the manual indicates that eventually the battery will burn out; so I might want to get a backup in any case.There really is so much here that I have only barely touched the surface. This camera is fantastic, and takes ten megapixel images. You can also set it up to take much smaller images, and the ten megapixels can be set up for normal or for finer. The next step up in this series is the Fujifilm Finepix J38 12MP Digital Camera with 3x Optical Zoom and 2.7 inch LCD which takes twelve megapixels in this tiny camera, with no apparent loss to quality.Read the manual. There is far more here than I can quickly share at this time and in this forum. I should mention as well that it does movies very well.My last review here was of Japanese Black Pine seeds, and I used this camera to film planting a seed. I used the LOWEST resolution (320) rather than the higher resolution (640) simply for the smaller file produced, meaning less time uploading to amazon. I was not sure how much room would be taken up by the film in any case. As it was, it was a much smaller file than I had imagined. All and all, in both still and film files, this camera produces very economical, small files.You can see at that review there is great depth of field, fine focus even at this lowest resolution, no real loss of quality, and good color balance throughout.An excellent camera, the best one I have, and I also have Nikons in my arsenal (Coolpix and D series).This camera is my new BFF!(OMG!!)", "Date": "November 2, 2009"}, {"Title": "Good for beginners, not for those with camera experience and expectations.", "Author": "Jennifer", "ReviewID": "R2AUASEJRW59VP", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "I was really excited to get this camera--I currently have a Canon Powershot SD600 that has started to misbehave and I was ready for a nice, new, snazzy 10MP camera. So how does the Fujifilm FinePix compare? **Let me preface this review by saying that I have read NONE of the manuals that came with the camera. I believe if I can't figure out a simple digital camera without reading the manual, it's probably not the camera for me. Also, there's no paper book--it's all on CD.**Well, first, the actual model number of the camera isn't printed anywhere on the camera, so I had to find my product packaging to see just which version I got (the box tells me it's the J28). That's not a deal breaker, of course, but I just find it odd.One big surprise? There is a tiny bit of internal memory which will allow you to take up to 11 pictures (at the lowest settings) or 1 picture (at the highest setting). I haven't seen a camera with that feature in a LONG time. That might be a bonus for someone who wants to test the camera and doesn't have their own SD card ready to go.A strange thing? This is the first camera I think I've ever seen where the battery can actually fit in more than one way! Now, that doesn't mean it will WORK in more than one way--there is a definite right way to put the battery in to get it to charge. But since I am used to batteries that only fit one way, I put in the battery (it fit!), locked it in, and closed and locked the camera door. And it wasn't charging. Hmmm. Tried another outlet. Still not charging. Unplugged and replugged the charging cable. Nothing. I finally thought to look at the battery and yep, I had it in backwards. I turned it around and the charging started right away. Oh, and yes, there's no battery charger--you leave the battery in the camera and have to plug in a mini USB-looking connection and then plug it into the wall. This action doesn't seem like it would lend itself well to having a backup battery.At first glance, the camera is slick. And thin. And the display screen is HUGE. The button placement seems nice enough--but the first thing I noticed was that there was no video mode! I knew the camera did video, so then I was on the hunt to find it. Well, I found it, and it's buried three screens in (menu, shooting mode, then scroll to Movie). This is a pretty big fault in my opinion, as usually when I decide to take a movie, it's a spur of the moment thing and I just want to flick a switch one-fingered (like on my old Canon). Having to stop to hit a few buttons and scroll to make a selection...well, it might become easier/quicker with time, but I don't like it.The camera boots up/turns on and takes pictures somewhat quickly, but I am finding that it often takes blurry pictures. I think this is mostly due to how long it takes to focus if the subject is moving AT ALL. (Which, I am taking pictures of my 8-month-old, so movement is something I pretty  much always have.) For a bunch of tries, I got a red AF! on the screen which I'm guessing means autofocus isn't working or hasn't yet focussed enough to take the picture (remember, I haven't read the manual). This actually seemed to happen more often than not--very frustrating. Other times you could see the green square jumping around the screen trying to decide what was a face so it could focus. Of the approximately 130 test shots, half were blurry. HALF! That's CRAZY.Something else I was unhappy with? The Picture Stabilization. It's ONLY a \"mode\" available three screens in (where the Movie mode is). Which means it's not something that's on all the time! This is a BIG fault for me, as this is something that is a default feature on most cameras these days (and not just a selectible mode). But the J28 is more of a budget camera, so I guess they offer some budget settings as well.I also found that if you try to take a second photo too soon after the previous photo, you can't. Plain and simple, it's like you've locked it out and you can hold the button down until the cows come home and it will not take a photo. So I hope you don't want to take pictures in quick succession! I thought it might have to do with viewing the photo on the screen--meaning, if you had the camera set to show the photo for 1.5 seconds, if you tried to take another during that first 1.5 seconds, you couldn't. So I turned off the photo viewing completely--and still had the problem. There doesn't appear to by any rhyme or reason to it... Sometimes I press the button quickly and it snaps a photo. Other times I have to do the halfway-hold to get it to focus and THEN it snaps a photo. Other times I hit the button and...nothing happens. I tested for like 10 minutes trying to figure out what was going on and I just gave up.Then I tested the macro setting. I have taken many macro photos in my life...and I could NOT get a good macro shot to save my life. The closest I could seem to get was about 3-4\" away, otherwise it was totally blurry. This distance limitation might just be part of the camera, but even so, I believe a true macro setting should be able to get up to an inch away. Again, this may be part of the \"budget\" aspect of the camera.The auto scene selection isn't the end-all-be-all that others have said. It seems to pick the wrong setting about half the time. I took two pictures of my dog sleeping on the couch (at a normal distance, maybe three feet). I then zoomed in, not moving, and suddenly it switched to Night setting and the pic turned out blurry. GRRRR. I then took two pictures of my son sitting on the floor. The first setting popped up as Auto and the photo came out okay. The second photo, where I physically moved a bit closer to him, changed to Night setting and came out blurry. WHAT?!? And of course there's no chance of taking a macro shot while on the auto setting (at least that I could see).One somewhat neat thing is that when you move through the menus, you get a short text description on the screen of what the mode is--or when you scroll through the different flash options, it tells you what each one is. That said, I didn't see anywhere to turn those off, and it quickly became annoying.So, overall, I unfortunately have to say I am NOT impressed with this camera. I have been using digital cameras for 10 years so I am not new to their abilities...and while this camera seems able to take some good pictures, it is also not as good as I wanted it to be. It is probably a good camera for a beginner...but for someone with as much experience (and expectation) as someone like me has, it falls a bit short. For now, I think I will go back to using my Canon PowerShot SD600 and give this camera as a gift to a niece or nephew or maybe my mother-in-law. To get the features I want and expect, I'm definitely going to have to go up in price.", "Date": "October 23, 2009"}, {"Title": "Impressive pictures for a low price", "Author": "Quoad Toad", "ReviewID": "R1XOHCD8UDN6T9", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Before using this camera, I was skeptical about the quality of the pictures from such a low priced camera.  I was shocked that right out of the box, this camera produced nice pictures.The J28 is simple to use.  It's good for beginners who don't want to mess with a lot of settings.  The picture quality out of the box is far better than the out of the box pictures with higher end digital cameras.Users can control important settings, such as ISO.  I like using a low ISO, so that's the only setting I immediately changed.  The flash is quite strong, so using a low ISO is feasible.  On the other hand, the flash remains strong even in areas where the light is more and adequate.The picture quality is nice.  The colors look vibrant, although the camera skews towards pink hues.  The pictures looked great when viewing them at about half their original size on my computer screen.  As I zoomed in to full size and beyond, I could notice fringing and artifacts.  I haven't yet printed pictures from this camera, but I speculate that the pictures will look good as 8x10s and below.The J28 is small and light and can easily fit in a purse or pocket.  The battery seems to last for over 200 pictures.This camera has a lot of good points, but there are a couple downsides - The camera is slow turn on and zooming in and out takes much longer than higher end cameras.  The body is plastic and feels slightly \"cheap.\"  At this price point, these aren't complaints as much as warnings to a potential buyer.Overall, I highly recommend the J28 to anyone who is looking for a simple starter camera.", "Date": "November 5, 2009"}, {"Title": "The Price is Right", "Author": "Normal Guy \"Happily Married with Children\"", "ReviewID": "R2D0JNZ28A2AGS", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I will make my review simple and straight to the point. The reason why this camera caught my eye is price.  A name brand camera (Fuji) with 10MP for $79, AND, Amazon gives you a free Fuji 2 GB SD memory card ($9) and a free Case Logic DCB-16 ($9) with it (look for that deal next to the picture of the camera where it says a limited time offer). So top that with my Amazon Prime free shipping and I got a great deal (equivalent to $45 if bought locally). Now for the rest of the story. At first glance, the camera is slick, thin and the display screen is nice size. However, when I gave it to my daughter, who is into youtube, the first thing she said was that she wished I bought her a camera that does video. (?) initially I thought I made a mistake and bought one that does not do video, since looking at the J28, it did not have a video mode button. However, we had to hunt that feature down ... and found it buried three screens in (menu, shooting mode, then scroll to Movie). This is NOT practical in my opinion since video shoots are usually on a spur of the moment.  Still the Price is Right and its a Fuji. The second issue to look out for is that the battery does not go in \"one way - the correct way\". The slot is not designed to accept a one way.  You can put it in the wrong way and it fits, yet will not charge.  Make sure to line up the two power strips of the battery to the the two charger strips and you're good to go.  All in all, its a non-refurbished Fuji (new), with a large screen, 10MP, 2GB card and a case for a very good price.", "Date": "November 26, 2009"}, {"Title": "Good Camera", "Author": "Radar Tech", "ReviewID": "R28VYQEMQ7XFCU", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I got this camera several days ago while it was on BF Sale. For the most part I am very pleased. The camera takes very good pictures and has great battery life. The anti-shake or Picture Stabilization mode works well. As some others have stated, you will have to manually select the Picture Stabilization mode if you want it enabled. This camera is small and as others have stated a fingerprint magnet because of the glossy black finish. The fingerprint issue doesn't bother me. The only five negatives that I have are:1: The camera housing is a little too much plastic (most cameras are at this price point).2: The camera close up shots are hard to focus, so forget about any real close up shots within a foot or less.3: Indoor shots that I took mostly have to use a flash under low lighting (pictures came out looking excellent with the flash).4: You have to manually select the Picture Stabilization mode if you want it enabled.5: Plastic battery cover is somewhat flimsy (be careful when opening). Open by pressing down firmly on the cover and then gently sliding cover out away from camera. Too much force will probably break the cover.Aside from the negatives this is still a very nice camera. Overall pictures come out looking excellent. I own Canon and Kodak cameras and I would rate the FinePix J28 as good as anything in its price range compared to those brands. Another thing to mention is that the image stabilization is digital controled on the FinePix J28, not optical. Optical stabilization is considered to be better than digital. I will say that with this camera, the digital image stabilization works great. I deliberately shot some pictures with excessive movement, and all of the pictures came out 100% perfect.Positive Points Are:1: Excellent Battery Life (rechargeable lithium ion).2: Small Battery charger.3: Excellent pictures (outdoor and indoor).4: Excellent digital image stabilization.5: Very nice small camera size.6: Movie mode works very good along with the audio.7: LCD is sharp and vivid.8: Menus are intuitive or easy to understand.9: Shutter lag between shots (with or without flash) is good.10: Good price vs quality + features.", "Date": "December 2, 2009"}, {"Title": "Great Camera for the Price", "Author": "Timothy J.

With one small exception (unlike any other camera I own which uses a battery--and I own several--the battery will go in either way with contacts down, but only one way is correct) I was totally successful in doing this.One major benefit of the FinePix J28 over many other compact point and shoot cameras is that, until the battery needs replacement or you wish to change memory cards, the card and battery stay in the camera.  The camera will charge with the supplied cord, without requiring removal of the battery.The controls are also intuitive.  There aren't so many specialized functions that you get lost. (Disclaimer: I don't need the camera to find faces for me, and didn't test this feature.)  I was able to \"setup\" for language, date and time without needing to consult the instructions.  The controller then brings you easily into what are the functions you need quickly: flash, macro, self-timer and trash.  (About this last one:  I strongly recommend trashing bad photos as you go, before the task gets daunting.)The FinePix J28 camera has an auto-off feature if it goes unused for awhile, and you may find this annoying, but since the display uses power even when you're not taking pictures, it will save you from having a battery die in the middle of the day.  Given the high capacity of memory cards (my 2GB card holds almost 800 shots at high resolution) you're likely to run out of power before you run out of room for pictures.Outdoor photography can be a challenge, in that with too much sunlight the display is hard to see.  Don't waste your time looking for a point-and-shoot which also has a viewfinder, because they don't seem to be making them anymore.  Just take multiple shots (there's a function for that!) in the right direction and, when you get home to your computer, crop away!  This is a good reason to take your photos in high-res even if you're not planning to enlarge them.The shutter is quick and I've been happy with the shots of people and nature which I've taken so far, including some indoors without flash.The Fuji FinePix J28 camera comes with its own software, but I was successful in downloading photos to my Windows computer by connecting the camera to my desktop via the (supplied) USB cable and moving the files from the camera (which came up as a device in \"My Computer\") to a file in \"My Photos\".Now, about that manual.  While the FinePix camera does come with a basic quick-start sheet in many languages (which I didn't consult because I was conducting the \"Know-It-All Challenge\"), the manual is on a disc.  This is a compact camera meant to be taken away from home and perhaps even away from a laptop.  If Fuji doesn't wish to furnish a paper manual--and I believe they should--the digital one should at least be on a USB thumb drive, so it is accessible on devices (such as netbooks) without disc drives.Back in the day, when I used film cameras, I always preferred Fuji film to the stuff in the yellow box.

Easy to use.3) As expected, high ISO photos are pretty noisy.

I've got big hands, and I had no problem operating anything on it.I didn't evaluate the software because I used Picasa and iPhoto (for Windows and Mac, respectively).

It's comparable in size to a \"fat\" wallet. Additionally, the attractive black plastic feels durable. It definitely looks more expensive than the current $100 price tag (the shiny black color helps in that regard). The LCD screen is huge, bright, and clear, though real time video playback is a bit choppy. But again this camera is really thin, and that's the most obvious feature as far as aesthetics go.Functionality: If you keep everything on Auto, most of your pictures will be almost perfect. If you want more control, the camera offers some basic manual options, including White Balance adjustment, exposure compensation, and manual ISO selection (keep this one on 100 for best quality). Personally, I will be keeping the J28 on Auto for quick photo shooting, and use an older Canon A590IS camera for manual shots. Video capture quality is Ok at 640x480 (with sound), but then again this is not a camcorder. If you don't want to dig into any of the options, the camera is very intuitive to use when set in Auto mode. It's simply the familiar task of pointing the camera, pressing the button halfway and waiting for the auto-focus, and then pressing the button all the way down. That's it. Perfect for technologically-challenged folks. ;)It doesn't require any drivers on Windows 7 (the only OS I tried it with, but Windows Vista should be the same); it's literally Plug&Play.; Simply connect the USB cord and use the Windows Picture Transfer wizard to get the photos, or you can browse them like you would with a flash drive. Though it does come with a disc containing software (FinePixViewer S v2.1) for both PCs and Mac, but I didn't install it.There are two things that would personally consider negatives. 1) I don't like the fact that this camera uses a rechargable battery (and not AAA), but this more of a personal preference and many people prefer not having to deal with AAA batteries. And 2) it uses a micro-USB connector instead of the more common mini-USB. However, I understand that both these characteristics are found in almost all other thin P&S; cameras, so it wouldn't be fair to remove any stars.Overall, if you are looking for an easy to use, durable camera, which takes good quality stills, the FujiFilm J28 is a recommended choice.", "Date": "October 19, 2009"}, {"Title": "Good color quality at a cheap price.", "Author": "TurtleWax", "ReviewID": "RSIGZFGW097KD", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This is the 3rd Fuji finepix series camera that I have purchase for myself or others and it is the best yet.

It was easy to connect to the computer and upload the pictures, as well as it charged off the USB port on the computer too. The quality of pictures was substantially better than our old camera. We hd a 7mp Camera and could instantly see better quality pictures with this camera. I also liked the speed at which it took pictures. Too many times we have had to have the kids hold still for longer periods as the camera attempted to take pictures. This camera took the picture the moment you pressed the button, which is great for us with small kids who have small attention spans.

Indoor shots requiring flash are acceptable, but slightly less than great. Menu is easy to understand, and transferring pic's to computer is very simple.I purchased this camera to take on a trip to New York City, because I didn't want to be encumbered with my larger Kodak (Z712, with 10x zoom).  A friend who accompanied me on the trip purchased a Nikon Coolpix. We took many pictures at the same time, under the same conditions, of the same subject.  After comparing our pic's, I was pleased to find that my Fuji consistently produced better pictures than the Nikon. In fairness, it could be that my friend didn't use the appropriate settings for her camera, but I also noticed the Nikon seemed more complicated, and not as user friendly.I would highly recommend this camera for anyone looking for a functional, practical, fun to use point and shoot camera at a great price.

Over the years I kind of slipped away and when digital photography started to blossom I started getting point and shoot cameras. I now also have a DSLR which I love. I love the quality, the control, the options, the creativity. But here is my confession, I still probably use the point and shoot cameras in our house more. They are just so easy to use, easy to manage (fit in a pocket), and produce good results. They can also capture video something my particular DSLR can not do. If you absolutely had to give me a choice of one digital camera I would stay with my DSLR. But as I said I use my point and shoot cameras more frequently as the way things seem to work out; short road trips, camping, day at the ballpark, etc. they are just easier to use a lot of the time. So there is a definite place for a point and shoot camera for almost everyone.The J28 is a solid performer with a lot of great features that are very useful to the consumer that happens to be at a good price. That is important, a good price doesn't mean anything if the camera can not perform. First it captures colors well with good saturation in most situations. For me after a few weeks of use, I got consistently good results indoors and good to ok results outdoors. In tricky outdoor lighting situations on automatic scene recognition (which most people will use most of the time) you are not going to get perfect exposure. But the colors outdoors were well represented and I appreciated the detail, it has a good quality lens.Cool features: the J28 has a number of really neat features especially at its price point. First is a rechargeable battery that can be re-charged inside the camera. A charge lasts a long time. The camera is also small and lightweight although it has a more plastic feel to it than digital ELPH cameras from Canon that I have used and still use. The menu system is easy to use and you have some cool options I have not seen on other point and shoot cameras. You can actually crop a picture during view picture mode. It was pretty easy to do. It also has a panorama feature that lets you `stitch' 3 pictures together (I have had this on other point and shoot and I like it). The J28 takes decent video but like many point and shoots you can not zoom once you start taking the video. The scene recognition mode works well and I have taken some decent close-ups using the macro mode.The primary draw back is as mentioned before it has real trouble in tough exposure situations. Also the included software literally did not work for me. It installed correctly, the drivers installed correctly, but the software would not download pictures from the camera. I have had well over a dozen point and shoot cameras over the years and this has never happened to me. On windows it was no big deal, the computer did recognize it as a storage device and I got the pictures out easily enough. It was definitely odd though.Bottom line is a well-thought out consumer point and shoot. Are there better point and shoot cameras out there that produce better shots? Yes. Are there many cameras out there that produce the well reproduced colors of shots this camera does and include so many useful and neat features in a very small and lightweight package at this price point? No. This will definitely be in my pocket for a long time, very easy to take, and be there when I need it and I most likely would not have brought my DSLR along.", "Date": "October 30, 2009"}, {"Title": "Excellent inexpensive everyday camera", "Author": "J. SPIEGEL \"Joe\"", "ReviewID": "R2DCHP9D5EDWGX", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Fujifilm FinePix J28 10MP Digital Camera with 3x Optical ZoomThis camera is a joy to use. I love that it's so small, I bought a belt pouch for it and can easily take it with me. It certainly can fit in almost any pocketbook. At a price around $100 (as of this writing) it's a bargain. It takes very good pictures and with 10 Megapixels of resolution you can edit and crop and still have an excellent result. The big rear screen is bright and clear in all but the brightest outside areas. The menu structure is easy and relatively powerful for a \"consumer\" camera. I personally miss a parallax viewfinder but the future of these cameras is LCD.I might pick a nit over the lack of a started SD card but they're so cheap now I won't just remember to get at least a 2GB one to use.  There is internal memory but just get a card. My Windows 7 PC recognized it without issue and imports the pictures into my pictures folder. The charger and data cable are included and work as expected.  It uses a battery pack instead of standard batteries. It's a bit restricting but holds a long charge and should be just fine.Maybe it's me, I just can't get over the fact that this many quality and fun features is in a below $100 camera.

Then after some days lens didn't come out from the camera with zoom error when camera was switched on. However, after many tries of ON-OFF, camera worked perfectly well.After some months picture quality became reddish pink, may be because it got some raindrops in it. Zoom error continued to come. I contacted their customer support, but they were not much friendly.I put this camera aside, as I do not use too much camera. After some months (2 or 3) when I switched on the camera, everything worked perfectly well. Picture quality was as it was before, when I bought it. Zoom error comes a while, when I zoom the camera. But every other thing works perfectly well now.I gifted this camera to my younger brother, and I have ordered Nikon coolpix, which is great so far.Conclusion: This camera may be right for you, if you are looking for a cheap camera.

The 10 megapixel resolution on this tiny-winy camera put my Rebel to shame. Fuji's point-and-shoots are known for their low light ability and it looks like they still are.I always consider a DSLR as the camera of choice if you have the time to study your subjects and want more control for creativity, but a point-and-shoot is best if you want less hassle and don't have the time to fool with the controls.One of the most powerful tools on this camera that is not normally found on other cameras is the Scene Recognition. Cameras today are getting more and more foolproof, this function is another innovative step to achieve that goal. It automatically choose for you the best settings out of the 6 shooting modes base on what you are shooting at. Face recognition is also very handy, it makes sure that the focus and exposure will be based on your people subjects.I normally prefer the regular low-disharge AA or AAAs so that I can always have a ready back up if I run out of juice. But regular batteries are big and to build a really small and portable camera, the lithium-ion is the way to go - light, powerful and small.I use Picassa and iPhoto for photo management so I did not have a chance to play with the included CDs (2 CDs came with the box).Pros:+ ease of use+ 1600 ISO for a point and shoot is amazing+ stabilization works good+ great camera interface+ fast start up. It is ready to shoot almost as soon as you turn the camera on.+ huge LCD screen+ entry level price+ sleek, good looks, the ooooohs and the aaaaahs+ as opposed to regular NiMh batteries, lthiumi-ion batteries remain charged even up to 18 months. That means you always have the camera ready to shoot anytime you pick it up.+ portability. Now i can bring a camera everywhere I go. My 2 megapix phone is not good enoughCons:- bland colors- no viewfinder- slow zooming on both shooting and playback- zoom is not operational during video captureBuck for buck, with all the functionality and characteristics, this cam is a winner----------------SEE actual sample video and pics on the comment section.", "Date": "October 23, 2009"}, {"Title": "Easy-to-use digital camera is a great choice for the price", "Author": "Shevi \"FantasyWeaver\"", "ReviewID": "RZGTJ1NHDALAY", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "If you're looking for a cheap camera that's easy to use and takes great pictures, the Fuji FinePix J28 is a pretty good choice.It's light-weight, attractive and very compact, fitting easily into a pocket or a purse. There are very few buttons on the back and the icons are fairly easy to understand. On screen choices are written in plain English. While there are several settings to choose from--portrait, landscape, night, macro, night portrait, backlight portrait and panorama--I only used the auto setting for all the shots I took, and I was very pleased with the results.  The colors were good, the sharpness of the photos was excellent, so much so that I could blow up just a small part of a picture and still have a great picture.I was particularly impressed by the camera's ability to take pictures in low light. Indoor pictures are so bright they look like they were taken outdoors, and pictures taken at twilight look like they were taken at sunset. I was also impressed that the automatic red-eye correction actually works. I've seen other cameras that claim to have this feature still take pictures with red eye, but so far no red eye with this camera. I was a little less impressed with the anti-blur feature. It's pretty good, but I still found some blurring here and there. The camera is relatively quick to take a picture, which is great. The last thing you want is for the scene you're trying to take a picture of to disappear as your subject walks away between the time you press on the button and the camera snaps the picture.  I haven't found that a problem with this camera.The display is a decent size, but there's no viewfinder. This bothers me for two reasons: first, the constant use of the digital display eats up the battery's power, and second, it can be fairly difficult to make out what you're taking a picture of when sunlight is reflecting off the display.  If I could change a few things on this camera, it would be add a viewfinder, increase the optical zoom, and add a wide-angle lens. Granted, the crispness of the photos mean you can \"zoom\" in at home when you manipulate your pictures on your computer, and a wide-angle lens would let in less light, which means the night and indoor shots wouldn't be as impressive as they are, so there are advantages to the way the camera is.One more thing if you're planning to buy this camera: remember to get a SDHC card! With a 10 megapixel camera, you're going to need it. 2-4 GB should be fine.So if you're looking for an affordable, easy-to-use digital camera to capture the special moments in your life, the Fuji FinePix J28 is a good choice.", "Date": "October 29, 2009"}, {"Title": "Happy with my new Fuji", "Author": "Lady zenomi \"zenomi\"", "ReviewID": "R2RYMLHRVDUKC1", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I received my camera a couple days ago..I was a bit worried initially about purchasing this brand of camera but went with the reviews.

The camera does what it can to adjust, but ultimately it takes steady hands to \"line up\" the three photos. Doesn't look too bad, though.I also like the sports option which takes a shot on moving objects without the blur. I was skeptical at first, but when I turned to this option and took a picture, it worked.I've used it an afternoon on and off and an evening playing with it. Battery still full. This is a good sign, even though I did buy an extra battery.Close up pictures are a bit pathetic, though, even with the \"macro\" and \"close up\" options.

Three reasons that make this product a dealbreaker:1. Digital Zoom v. Optical Zoom: The optical zoom advertised is more or less non-existent. All the zoom feature does is enlarge a portion of the image, `simulating' optical zoom. In other words, the camera crops a portion of the image and then enlarges it back to size. In so doing, you lose image quality. If you've been regularly using digital zoom and wondered why your pictures did not look that great, now you know.2. Auto-Scene Selection: This is one of the 15+ picture settings offered and one of two 'Auto' options, but Auto-Scene only picks from about half the total photo-shooting scenarios available. The Auto-Scene setting is good at detecting landscapes and flowers as subjects, but is unreliable other scenarios, especially in low lighting. You might be better off just leaving the setting on Auto or manually picking a setting from the list. You might not see a difference, if at all, between some of the other settings, such as Text and Flower or Sport and Party.3. Menu Nesting & Accessibility: The timer option is easily accessible with a shortcut button, but the video mode is buried beneath two menu levels, so if you're the type of photographer who needs to take a lightning-fast video of an endangered bird or a celebrity leaving a restaurant, expect to miss a lot of opportunities.Fujifilm is known for the quality of its color and negative films, instant cameras, and printer products, but not really for its digital cameras.There's a reason for that.If you want to invest in reliable, affordable, run-of-the-mill point-and-shoot digital camera, stick with the reputable digital camera makers who've been doing it well all along: Canon, Olympus, and Nikon.", "Date": "January 8, 2011"}, {"Title": "Excellent Camera", "Author": "mlm", "ReviewID": "R2DQUUHHX03ZMM", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I have compared the pics on this camera to some of the more expensive brands and you cannot tell the difference.

She used it briefly over the holidays, liked it fine but her dislike of using her last camera got her out of the habit of taking pics.  Fast Forward to this morning.... Family is visiting and she wanted her camera to capture the memories.  Battery is low, so after we finish tearing apart the house to locate the charge cable we plug it in and ... nothing.  Dead.  Take out the battery...  make sure the contacts line up... they do.  I remove the mem card; take out battery; take out both mem card and battery... no luck.  Check to make sure the outlet's got power - It does.  Test the cable on another device... cable's good.  When we're out of ideas, I go online only to discover people are reporting a bunch of sthese  Find out this is a common problem.  Nose around a bit, try some other troubleshooting solutions... See a couple posts which suggest turning the battery over - but they have a different model than ours, and there's only one way the battery will fit in this model.  Besides, I'm not that stupid.Well, that's where I was wrong.  Even though the battery is shaped like those preventing improper insertion - think of a miniUSB plug that's wider on the bottom than the top - that's not the case.  I flipped the battery over so that the side of the battery bearing a circle design is facing the same direction as the lens and inserted it brass-contacts-end first.

The lack can lead to missed shots especially when you are trying to catch special moments.  This became a little less of an issue as I got to know the camera, but I still have more of those moments after pictures than I wish.  Outdoor still shots and text shots seem to be best, which is nice, but indoor shots can be a little washed out under some indoor lighting situations, and if you are looking to take shots in the middle of a lot of action, this probably is not the camera for you.  Overall, I like this camera, but I am a little disappointed with some of its limitations.3 out of 5 stars", "Date": "January 3, 2010"}, {"Title": "did not work after one day", "Author": "Katherine J.

David Swan", "ReviewID": "R2L51MJG3LEAEO", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "This is the fourth digital camera I've owned and so far my favorite has been the Olympus FE-340 8.0 m with 5x optical zoom. I had written an entire review comparing the two camera's with the point being that my venerable Olympus took better photos then the much newer Fujifilm FinePix. This was the plan until I discovered that my Olympus was selling on Amazon for $343.98 compared to the $99.95 listed price of the FinePix. I can assure you I paid nothing close to the $340 when I bought the Olympus at Circuit City last year but it wouldn't be fair to compare the two since the FinePix is clearly a budget priced camera. Just holding the two in my hands I can feel the much higher quality of craftsmanship in the Olympus and the only thing the FinePix seemed to be superior in was in the crispness of detail in blown up pictures which is exactly what I would expect given its higher pixel count.The FinePix is a budget camera with budget quality. It's worthless on night shots and unlike my Olympus doesn't keep the shutter open long enough to allow in any light (not that the Olympus takes great night shot). I had a real tough time with close up shots in flower (macro) mode and continually got the red reticule of doom. When I tried to take a picture of a pepper growing in my garden the FinePix stubbornly refused to focus on the pepper no matter how I adjusted and always focused on the ground (which did look stunningly clear). I took some close up photos of my herb garden and I have to say that in this case the FinePix was both clearer and more natural looking than the Olympus. If you're looking to take crisp close up shots I would definitely recommend a camera with a 5x optical zoom.On tough shots the FinePix fails but if you're looking to get some easy shots in normal light it works fine. Sometimes I got some graininess on my indoor shots and other times it looked fine. I took a walk around my office shooting pictures of stairwells and hallways and a copier and for a budget prices camera is seemed to do just fine. In fact the indoor close-up shots looked pretty good, you just can't get as close as you can with a 5x optical zoom. Any closer than say 6 to 7 inches and the camera cannot get focus. I took some outdoor shots on a cloudy day and they looked very nice and well detailed. One feature that is unique among all the digital camera's I've owned is that the port for linking the camera to a PC is the same port for charging the lithium battery. I like that but I felt like copying from the camera to the PC took longer than normal. Also, cameras I've had in the past would turn on automatically when I linked it to a PC but I had to turn the FinePix on myself.To summarize this is a budget camera for people who want to take photos under optimal conditions. The daytime landscape shots looked very good but you can feel the cheapness of the camera the moment you take it out of the box. I'll give it four stars because by and large you get what you pay for.", "Date": "October 29, 2009"}, {"Title": "Not impressed even at low-price point", "Author": "C. Grevstad", "ReviewID": "R3UZSHAB935FCM", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "I ordered this camera from Amazon for an amazing price (as usual for Amazon!). However, upon receiving the camera and snapping pictures under different scenarios I became under-impressed very quickly. My previous camera, casio exilim s770, was smashed in a car door accidentally and suffers from some problems. This Fujifilm was my attempt to replace the Casio. Unfortunately it falls terribly short of the expectations set by the former. Particularly low-light shots look grainy and dull. I prefer taking shots without the flash, if at all necessary, to preserve the natural color and ambiance of a scene I'm capturing. The Fujifilm will not cooperate at all with me under these circumstances and using the flash will produce a crisp, but very generic looking shot. This camera may be just what some people want, but for me it lacks the ability to make pictures special/unique. I am in the process of returning this camera in hopes I can repair my Casio.Pros:-Price-Ease of Use-Battery life seemed fine-Pictures look good under safe/standard scenarios (ie: good light, little movement, flash use)-The Panoramic mode is very cool and something my Casio lacks, however not very useful to print or share.Cons:-Build is mostly plastic, feels very light.-Lower-light/night shots are poor-Shutter speed SLOW. You will be waiting several seconds between taking shots. Very frustrating.-Face detection seems spotty at best-Minimal Shot-modes. Definitely geared towards people who will simply keep it on 'Auto' mode.-Nothing really stands out at all that makes this camera special to me", "Date": "December 16, 2009"}, {"Title": "after one use, battery died", "Author": "Si Diep Le \"rfpro\"", "ReviewID": "ROQSORM1A40T6", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "How am I supposed to feel after giving the camera to the wife for Christmas present, the battery died after initial try?

The directions dont offer any help or suggestions on how to fix the problem I had.  The box had a DVD disc enlcosed for further instructions, but I wasn't going that far after reading thru the directions.  The only reason I bought this Fuji camera is bacause I wanted one of the newer digital camera models which have the BIG DISPLAY WINDOW in the back so that I could see the new snapshots better.
