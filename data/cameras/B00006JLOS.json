{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Serious film-based photo-hobbyist, the wait is over!", "Author": "\"mressa\"", "ReviewID": "R26Z8OPSVZ4ZGN", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I have been an avid photographer for over 35 years. I recently sold over $7,000 worth of Leica equipment because it was gathering dust. Even so, I have not given up on film-based photography just yet and have a complete collection of professional-grade Nikon SLR equipment. This is the context in which I make the following comments about the Olympus C-5050, a 5 megapixel digital camera.I have been watching the evolution of digital cameras for a number of years, wondering if they would ever approximate film-based photography for the advanced hobbyist. I can report without reservation that based on my brief experience with the Olympus C-5050 that day has come.Are we there yet? - When I reviewed the current crop of \"pro-sumer\" non-SLR digital cameras, I expected to pick up an interim camera that would hold my \"digital curiosity\" for a couple years and revisit the issue when 20 megapixel cameras were the norm and film-based photography was dead to all but a few narrowly focused professionals. What I came away with is that 5 megapixel is more than adequate for 99% of your print requirements and strikes a good balance in the areas of file size and write speed. Will 6, 8 and 10 megapixel cameras that come out in the next couple years do a better job? Not necessarily if the bulk of your prints are in the 5x7 to 8x10 range (although even 11x14 fairs rather well) and you crop your subjects with care.The images - After reading a couple of reviews, not the least of which was at dPreview.com, I was concerned about a couple issues; noise levels (the equivalent of grain in film-based photography) and chromatic aberrations in high contrast images. There was also criticism that the sharpness of the images was a little harsh. Resultantly, I set the camera for sharpness, contrast and saturation as recommended by this well respected reviewer. The first thing I noticed was the images were not contrasty enough. Then I started to look at other attributes including the noise and CA issue. I came to the opinion that Olympus may have taken these criticisms to heart and recalibrated their software to correct the noise problem and zeroed out the sharpness, contrast and saturation adjustments. In terms of the CA issue, I simply haven't shot into situations where this is a problem. Then again, maybe I'm not as critical as some reviewers.Point is, the camera takes wonderfully sharp, contrasty, and \"noiseless\" photographs that 99% of the people using this camera would be hard pressed to differentiate from a 35mm pro-sumer SLR.The camera - I was an owner of Leica rangefinder equipment for over 10 years so I appreciate a well made camera. I loved the solid feel of the Leicas, the ergonomics, and precision of these photographic instruments in miniature. I wasn't expecting this, but I have the same appreciation for this Olympus. The magnesium body has weight, it feels solid (with the exception noted below), it fits your hands perfectly, the controls are where you would expect them, and there is just the right number of external controls; not too many to be confusing and not too few to require frequent visits to \"drop-down menu hell\" which is a place even Nikons occasionally send you to.The caveat to the comments about the \"feel\" of the camera is the lens that extends and retracts when you turn the camera on and off. It looks cheesy and subjects the extendable plastic lens housing to damage. The solution is to permanently install an Olympus CLA-1 conversion lens adapter, a 43-46mm step-up ring and a UVa filter. This well machined metal extension provides a self-contained extension in which the lens extends and retracts and looks every bit a part of the original design of the camera. The lens is protected and it improves the looks of an already good looking camera.The competition - I didn't start looking for the Olympus. I was initially looking at the Leica Digilux 1, the Nikon CoolPix 5000 and 5700. I also looked at the well-regarded Canon G3. When I asked the salesperson whether there were other cameras I should consider, he pointed me to the Olympus C-5050, \"Try this, a lot of people come away with a very favorable impression of the Olympus and end up buying it.\" Mind you this is at a high-end camera store in the Bay Area.The Leica was a little bigger and boxier than it needed to be; not a bad camera but didn't necessarily follow in the footsteps of the M6 or M7. I was disappointed by the Nikons. In addition to the reliability problems reported about the CoolPix 5000 elsewhere, the ergonomics weren't quite right and you needed to delve into confusing menu options too change basic settings. The 5700's LCD was simply too small and it was annoying how you either got the LCD screen on the back of the camera or the LCD through the viewfinder, never both. The Canon was nice but felt a little too much like a point-and-shoot.Other picks, the Leica and Nikons use a proprietary battery which means you will have to add an additional hundred dollars or so to the purchase of the camera if you don't want to run out of power. The Olympus wisely uses standard AA's that you can get anywhere in a pinch and even the best rechargeables cost only $20 for a pack of 4. Additionally, the Olympus is very good on battery power, you can shoot an entire day and the batteries still have a good charge. The Leica uses only SD memory and the Nikons use only CF whereas the Olympus can use 4 different types of memory.Bottom line, the Olympus exceeded my expectations in every respect. And here's the best complement one can pay any camera - with the Olympus C-5050, I don't miss my Leica's.", "Date": "February 7, 2003"}, {"Title": "Continuing the Olympus quality tradition", "Author": "Dale Reid", "ReviewID": "RFQKWYC55YXSJ", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I was very leary of the digital world, having seen very mediocre pictures from friends' digital cameras in the 1.0 megpixel range.  I was very concerned when my wife presented me with an Olympus D-490 2.1 megapixel camera as a gift.  The first few shots of our dog (zoomed in to show the whiskers with a wonderful sharpness) changed my mind.  While the difference between film and this camera's pictures was apparent, the benefits of digital made this our camera of choice 90%of the time.  A fall put the camera out of service, and I \"upgraded\" to a Nikon 885, thinking that our other Nikon film cameras were top notch, and Nikon wouldn't let a poor performer out the door.  The disappointment despite my trials at fixing the poor contrast, smudged appearing results was a constant reminder of this poor choice.  When Olympus announced the C-5050, I decided to try it again, specifically because of the experience with the D-490, and the fact that I had a collection of Compact Flash cards that would now fit into this Olympus product.The thrill is back!  The first few pictures brought back the same excitement of seeing a wonderfully crisp, well exposed photo.  There is a significant improvement in the ability to \"zoom in\" on portions of the image and still get very acceptable 5x7 prints.  The lcd screen's sharpness and detail are improved.  This is what the Nikon should have been.Sure, the menus take a bit of getting used to.  And the on-off switch invariably gets turned to the on position when I put the camera back into my coat, and the position of the tab on the switch makes it less intuitive to switch it off without looking.  The pivoting lcd only pivots 20 degrees down, making it hard to frame a shot while holding the camera above your head and the rest of the crowd.  But despite a few rough edges, this camera's performance and features now place it as one of the best I've had the pleasure to handle.  I've yet to test the night shots and extended exposure times, and the flash needs augmentation for larger group shots, but after all, there is a hot shoe on top.  The feel of the camera is solid and professional, and while a tad hefty, its compact size adds to the feel of quality. I hope the depenability of my original Olympus flows through to this camera.", "Date": "November 30, 2002"}, {"Title": "Happy customer", "Author": "\"kvenator\"", "ReviewID": "RK6HWY6YF7BWQ", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I have had the Olympus 5050 since November and now feel comfortable with many of the cameras features (many of which are different from traditional, manual 35mm cameras).  I didn't have the benefit of many reviews at that time; but decided the time, features and price were right.  To put things in perspective, I was (and still am) a 35mm photographer of landscapes using slide film although I use the film camera much less now.  I have a film scanner that I used to convert the negatives and slides to hi-res digital image files and would print these files after editing in Photoshop LE and/or Elements.  The 5050 has improved the process in these areas:1. instant feedback.  I have a good idea as to whether or not the shot will be a good one.2. no wait for developing, no associated film and developing cost3. sufficient megapixel count for larger prints.  Camera includes internal interpolation to 8 megapixels.  Use of Photoshop Elements bicubic (or equivalent) interpolation to larger pixel counts can result in great large prints.  I've printed 10x15's that look as good as the 35mm prints.  I have yet to print 20x30s; but I expect to be pleased (note: interpolation will be required via photoshop elemets or equiv.).Additional pluses:  uses a CF card, XD or Smart Media... I like having these choices given the uncertain nature of different memory standards.The camera feels good.  It's metallic and heavy feeling which gives at least the illusion of being well made. (e.g. passes the kick the tires test)  ;-)The camera has exposure times up to 16 seconds which can enable fairly low light shooting including night shots (see sample photos links below).  The camera includes a built-in number of modes for point and shoot picture taking as well as a manual mode (which I use exclusively except when taking panoramics).I use the 1gb CF microdrive and can fit almost 300 pictures on it taken at max resolution (SHQ enlarge size (jpg)).  Less for RAW and TIFF pictures.A couple of minor points: - I took several test shots under controlled conditions and found that a sharpening settings of -2, or -3 yielded prints with less noise - Constrast and saturation settings of -2 seemed to work best - I use iso setting of 64 exclusively for landscape shots.  Results in lower noise than at higher ISOs. - Movie mode is ok; but more of a toy than anything else (resolution 320x240) and is QuickTime format which is proprietary and the included Camedia software doesn't include the ability to edit or save to a different format. - Raw import plug-in wasn't available for photoshop at the time; but is available now - Olympus requires use of Olympus media to use the panoramic feature on the camera.  You can use the 32mb XD card to take the shots and use the camera's internal copy feature to copy the pictures to a non-olympus brand CF card. - I'm still tinkering with the white balance when shooting sunsets.  The colors don't seem to look as nice; but I've been able to correct this in Photoshop.", "Date": "February 17, 2003"}, {"Title": "if only someone wrote this before...", "Author": "WhyNotIdiot", "ReviewID": "RO92C167FPQA3", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "My review is going to be very valuable for those who bought already and have problems with Olympus C-5050 digital camera. That's the reason I post this as a Negative review although I think this is a very good camera when you understand how to use it. Here it goes. Read my lips: do NOT use Auto ISO - you'll get a lot of noise in your pictures. Configure you own settings (using My Mode) and set your ISO to 64 at all times. Any ISO higher that 64 (even 100) will produce noticeable noise. Also, while configuring \"My Mode\", set Noise Reduction to \"On\" and, the most important, set Sharpness to \"-4\" or \"-5\". If you do all the above, Canon G3 owners will be jealous of your shots.", "Date": "May 13, 2003"}, {"Title": "A Review for First Time Buyers", "Author": null, "ReviewID": "R9KN9C62ES94G", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I think this camera is worthy of a different kind of review than some of the ones I've read here, so I'll try to deliver that. I was a first-time-digital-user & buyer before this camera, and this is what I'd have wanted to know before buying this camera. First: You've probably heard now that this camera offers a thorough selection of manually adjustable options. If you're patient with the camera-manual (first the paper-bound one, then the much-longer CD-based one -which I ended up printing out) you can learn enough about the camera to experiment with every aspect of it. This brings me to my main point about this machine: Even though there are many controls, you can figure them out in a reasonable amount of time, and you get to EASILY experiment by taking pictures with different settings & simply learning what does what. My knowledge of photography has grown SO MUCH (from virtually nothing to a decent basic-understanding) because of trial & error with this c5050Z. You can do this too, and I think you'll like having so much control when you want it (it also has all the same pre-programmed \"auto\" modes for those who want to just point-&-shoot). AND NOW THE BEST PART ABOUT HAVING THE C5050: This camera features a \"superbright\" 1.8 lens. What this allows you (essentially) to do is take many pictures indoors WITHOUT using the flash (you can just turn it off). I've taken most of my pictures indoors (low-light settings seem to be the biggest challenge for digital-cameras), and I've been absolutely DELIGHTED with the ability to leave the flash off. This way, the subtle shadows that you see & warm lighting colors of your home don't get lost or bleached out, and you have pictures that are MUCH more realistic looking. MOST other 5MP cameras sacrifice this low \"1.8\" number for a greater optical zoom. Check out the f-stop range & see for yourself! (The higher the number, the less you have the ability to take living-room-light pictures without being forced to use flash.) Even Olympus sacrificed this feature in it's newer C5060, and I wouldn't make the trade-off for myself. TRUST ME, I LUCKED INTO THIS FEATURE, NOT KNOWING WHAT IT REALLY WAS, and wouldn't trade it for anything! Another nice feature is that this camera is actually MADE IN JAPAN. Call me 'old-fashioned,' but I still think that's better than being made in China or Indonesia (which they do with their more basic models). The feel and build quality of this product is just great. This model's already over a year old (which I knew before buying it last month), and there are fancier things out there now, but I think now's the time to get a great deal on this machine, and I would be surprised if you felt left-behind in any sense. In one of my recent Consumer Reports issues (November or December 2003), they rated this camera #2 in the 5MP group. But the camera that they listed as #1 (a Nikon) makes the kind of trade-off that I described earlier. It's also a good deal more expensive. My bottom line is that I believe you'll get a better value here than with most other cameras right now, and I offer you my encouragement to feel comfortable & excited about this choice. I'm sure there are drawbacks compared to other models & vice-versa, but I'm a very picky person, and I'm entirely satisfied that I bought an excellent product all-around.

It is very easy to use; and after the initial short learning curve, the extraordinary numbers of available custom adjustments are easy to make even from a somewhat confusing interface. I have taken spectacular pictures with it out of the box; and it is a great easy-to-use point-and-shoot camera despite its sophistication. However, pictures shot at wide angle have an unacceptable amount of noise and purple fringing (from chromatic aberration in the lens) which flaws otherwise gorgeous pictures; and there is too much lag time between pressing the shutter and taking the shot (even in pre-focus mode), which means that despite its burst speed, you won't be able to use it easily for action or candid shots to get the picture you saw through the viewfinder. These problems have been documented in various reviews of the camera on established digital camera review sites. It should be noted, however, that all of the 5 megapixel cameras of this sophistication (such as the Nikon 5700 and the Minolta 7IL) have some issues which make them less than ideal; and if you can accept the flaws in this camera, its price-performance ratio is spectacular.", "Date": "January 3, 2003"}, {"Title": "I love this camera", "Author": null, "ReviewID": "RML07AA0OKI96", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This compact camera takes beautiful & sharp photos & has tons of features to boot.

Nice tilting lcd although I must say I'm disappointed with the rather cheap viewfinder.  It takes some time getting used to the camera & the many menus but it's not too overwhelming.  Lots of flash options including red eye & 2 slow flash options plus slave.  The live histogram is an interesting & very helpful function. After reading up on it & experimenting with it, I'm sure it will help me with proper exposure. Will update in a few months or so after I've worked more with the camera.

That said, I have experienced a major glitch you should know about.  I originally bought a Viking 1 GB CompactFlash card to go with it.  Hours out of the box the card doesn't work.  After reading extensive forums on the subject (look under Olympus forum ..., it seems there are major compatibility issues with higher capacity CompactFlash cards and this camera.  Specifically firmware version 77 and 76 (and lower if you have it).  Version 78 seems to have very few complaints and you only get v79 when you send in the camera for repair and they happen to update it.  Now, there seems to be no way to check this version until you take a pic, put it onto you computer and use a program to look at the Exif information (like Exifer, freeware).  Olympus, Nikon, and other companies experiencing this are not giving up any info on this subject.  Apparently Olympus firmware upgrades can only happen overseas.  Some CompactFlash card companies are starting to list camera compatibility charts, but be warry.  Viking says the CF1GB works with the C-5050, but it didn't in my case.  I'm still trying to figure out whether I will be returning the camera and try to get another one in hopes it will have the better firmware.  Fortunately this camera takes 4 types of media.  Interesting how Olympus and Fuji make there own, new media type (xD Picture Card) and now the camera has problems with the CompactFlash.  Hmmm.  Maybe I should buy the Olympus brand card.  Kind of fishy, but I bought this camera with plans of using the cheaper CF cards.  I'm no expert on this.  You now know what to look into if you want or have this camera.

Of course, a tripod was very helpful as was the C5050's tiny remote.  No need to touch the camera, so no shake.  Beautiful!  I give this camera 5 stars but not the software and the manual.

Get a good paperback book on basic photography and you'll be OK.  As someone else said, this is not the camera to give your sweet 16 for her birthday, unless she happens to be in the photography club at school!Here's a quickie tutorial on running the menus: All the buttons under your left index finger are menu selectors.  Pick one and hold it down.  The LCD display will light up with an animated ring of settings to pick.  Use your right thumb to scroll the selector wheel until the setting you want is in its proper place.  Let go of the button and you're done.  The manual is written exactly backwards for understanding this.  (If you learned to speak in the manner the manual is written, you would have had to memorize the dictionary before you would be taught to say, \"Da Da.\") Explore the menus with your left index finger and your right thumb and all will become clear with time.Recommendation: buy an extender tube (they're cheap)to go over the lens.  It will allow you to use filters (the polarizer with a clear blue sky is wonderful) and it will protect the delicate moving lens from impacts and grit.  Do the old SLR trick of leaving a UV filter on at all times.  Very inexpensive insurance.Pros:1. Sees in very subdued lighting.2. You can manually intervene on most everything.3. The macro modes are marvelous.  It will focus right up to the lens.  (How about a full-frame of your fingerprint?)4. AA batteries are the way to go.  Buy a bunch of NiMH AA's and a good charger.  Look around; there are deals to be had.Cons:1. Reverts to default settings every time you turn it off except if you put them into the My memory.  Annoying but managable.2. The manual.

I had done my homework both on the vacation spots I intended to shoot and also on which camera to purchase. My previous digital was an Olympus D-510 which I had simply outgrown as my needs changed. I would still certainly recommend a 2.1 megapixel camera for anyone whose main goal is to take family photos and print out nothing larger than 5x7. I was even able to use my D-510 for photos which were submitted to a trade magazine for publication and had some great shots - learning the lighting features was a big plus.

The Nikon coolpix was number one. I don't exactly understand that considering that the 5050 gets 400 shots per battery charge, and the coolpix only 100. Additionally, the coolpix has an 8x zoom, and the Olympus has a 3x. Sometimes bigger isn't better. The problem with bigger zooms, is that they have really small lense sizes, therby limiting the amount of light they are capable of taking in. For inside the building shots, that is a super big factor. The Olympus with a 1.8 Super Bright Lense beats the competition. Think about it, if you want to take a shot in low light conditions, you have to have a long shutter speed. With a long shutter speed you need a tripod or a very steady hand. With a bright lense the C-5050 you barely need a flash. I have the Olympus C-2040 which also has the 1.8 lense, and I prefer to take pictures without the flash. It is almost like the camera records light undetected by the naked eye. The pictures are unbelievably bright for a so so light condition. Without the flash, you avoid the red eye problem, and the bleached out flash light. Skin tones and colors look a lot better without a flash.  Think about the brighter lense this way, when someone is moving around, or when you are in an action shot, the brighter lense automatically creates a faster shutter speed, so you get a non blurry shot. With a smaller lense opening, you are stuck with a longer shutter speed which results in a fuzzy shot. I know my earlier experience with 80-210 zooms, I always had to work around a 2.8 aperture. That is a serious limitation. My 2040 has a 3x zoom, and that is all you need. If you go crazy with a high zoom, you once again, should be using it on a tripod. The slightest hand shake is magnified with a big zoom. Then that is amplified even greater with the smaller aperture.  My Olympus C-2040 was consumer reports number one rated camera two years back. As CR puts it, the 2040 had superior printed picture results even above the 5 megapixel cameras. The following year it was comparable to the 5s. When printed on 8 1/2 by 11 glossy photo paper, you can't tell it from a 35mm photo.

That said, it took me until I had a serious need for a camera that could hook up to my Speedotron studio strobes.  I needed a replacement for a defunct Polaroid back so that I could test my lighting, etc. I also wasn't looking to replace my film based equipment so my need was for something reasonably priced that could produce fairly high quality images, can use camera/lens mounted filters and could fire off my studio strobes.  I found that in this camera!  Since the camera has a hot shoe (and no p.c. outlet) I'm able to attach a Wein Hot-shoe to PC adapter and fire my strobes.  The camera has fantastic optics and amazing range of capabilities that I've yet to get the opportunity to fully appreciate.  The picture quality is crisp and contrasty and yields excellent results under a variety of lighting conditions.  The fast 1.8 lens (at the wide angle position) produces fine images even hand held at 1/15th of a second (not that I'd typically take something that slow handheld but, I had to try it!).  Overall, a great camera for someone who needs the bells and whistles such as full manual exposure, multi-spot metering, flash exposure compensation, etc.PROS:- Mult-spot metering- Flash exposure compensation- \"MY Mode\" custom exposure mode settings- HOT SHOE!! (which can provide TTL flash with their flashes)- fast lens- adjustable display- rugged construction- Multiple media formats, multiple power source options- much, much more!CONS:- Doesn't go down to ASA 50 (though easily correctable with exposure compensation)- Learning curve for multi-spot metering because of unclear directions in manual- when in full manual the monitor doesn't show you what the image will look like at the current settings (check out the Canon A70 to see what I mean) it only shows you what a \"proper\" exposure would be (as determined by the camera's meter).- f1.8 only at wider angle setting.  Would be nice if it maintained f1.8 maximum through entire range.- would like a minimum aperature of f16 or f22- minimum aperature not consistant throughout entire zoom range.- would prefer a camera that had a zoom range of 28 - 135 (35mm equivilant)Now, that being said, the minimum and maximum aperature issue seemed to be consistant through every brand I played with.  Overall, the Olympus 5050 best fit my needs in features, performance, quality, etc.  For someone who loves the technical side of photography this is a great addition to your set-up.  For the avid amature, you won't be disappointed!As another reviewer pointed out, the Olympus CLA-1 lens adapter is a must.  Not only so that you can use filters on the camera but also to protect the zoom lens from damage (a fear of mine where all non-SLR or non Pro equipment is concerned).So much more can be said but I'll leave it at this.

This is the first digital camera I've owned, and I did a lot of research before deciding which one to buy. Key features that swayed me:* f1.8 lens (at wide-angle setting) for good low-light performance* moderate zoom (optional add-on zoom lens gives you a decent \"portrait\" zoom)* 5 MP (plenty of resolution for prints up to 8 1/2 x 11 in.)* price <$500 (I bought it new, but when it was technically \"last year's model\" because the C-5060 had already come out)* ability to shoot in RAW as well as TIFF and JPEG formats* uses AA batteries; no longer a prisoner of the proprietary lithium battery syndrome!* remote control (nice for group shots, longer exposures)* wide variety of customizable settings, as well as auto settings for emergencies or borrowing by less-geeky family & friends* good macro capability* flip-down LCD for easier shot previewing* flash hot-shoe (which I don't use currently, but is nice to have if I want it)* ability to accept multiple storage media formats (I use CompactFlash most of the time, and just recently got a Sandisk 1GB CF card which is working great so far)* panoramic capability (but only with Olympus xD cards)After using the non-digital Canon Rebel G for the previous few years, I'd finally gotten fed up with the slowness of the Rebel G's 35-80 mm zoom lens (f3.5 was the best it could do, so I had to use ISO 800 film unless I knew I was going to be in bright daylight for the duration of the roll). There were also maintenance problems (two expensive shutter repairs, and a camera back door that had to be secured with rubber bands after the catch broke). The last straw was returning from a trip with what could have been some great photos, paying $50+ to get them developed and printed, and finding that only 3 or 4 of them were any good at all. Bye-bye film!In researching digitals, I looked at many many sources of information, spending literally weeks populating a complex spreadsheet with various criteria. The most helpful source overall was imaging-resource.com, where I found the same test shots taken with all the cameras I was considering, plus detailed but easily understandable descriptions of camera features. Steve's Digicams also had some good info, and of course the user reviews on Amazon were valuable as well. By taking such a deliberate approach, I also realized what features were really important to me. For example, good macro performance was high on my list, but movie capability was merely a nice-to-have.I came very close to buying the Canon G3 but decided the Olympus C-5050Z had a slight edge by virtue of AA vs. proprietary batteries, and f1.8 lens vs. f2.0.Now that I've been using the Olympus for a while, I can give you the benefit of my experience. I've found that the speed of the camera (both startup and shot-to-shot) is excellent, despite some others' comments to the contrary. I've taken a lot of pictures that are very high quality (in my humble opinion), including amazing stuff like macro shots of an insect that was only 1/4\" long but looks like a monster from outer space in my photos! Most of my pictures are of outdoor nature subjects, and I've had very good results, with accurate color, very little--but some--chromatic aberration (purple fringing), wide dynamic range in my images, good results in a very wide variety of lighting situations, and even decent short movies (although I listed that as a \"nice-to-have,\" it is kind of fun!). Many times I've taken pictures that had things in them I didn't notice until later, such as the incredible colors and textures inside an iris blossom, or the \"cicada\" that turned out to be a hummingbird! (And thanks to the C-5050Z's excellent image resolution, I was able to crop and blow up that hummingbird and get a fantastic stop-action photo of this marvel of nature in flight!)I also like having several options that I was familiar with from using the Rebel G--aperture priority, shutter priority, full manual, as well as full automatic \"program mode.\" On top of that, you have many many other controls if you're willing to delve into them: white balance, color saturation, flash mode (I keep it turned off most of the time), ability to creatively over- or under-expose, and of course the all-important DELETE key if you see you've just shot a dud!It hasn't all been rosy with me and the C-5050Z, though. Several times I've been irritated to return to the computer and find that all my photos were apparently shot at midnight on 12/31/2001, because this camera loses the date & time setting every time you change batteries, and sometimes even when you don't! So I'm training myself to check the date & time before every outing. I've also had some frustrations with the focus. Quite often if the subject I want is in the foreground, the helpful auto-focus will give me a perfectly sharp background with a fuzzy subject!! Arggh! Maybe there's more about the focus metering I need to learn, but I was under the impression that \"spot\" focusing should do the trick. The results are not always consistent. I've also had some trouble getting the \"manual\" macro focus to work at times (it gives you a magnified view of your subject as you move the electronic slider up and down to get the setting you want); when it works it's great, but in bright light it's hard to see the LCD display and the microscopic numbers indicating distance to the subject--especially if it's a hot day and you've got sweat dripping off your nose and insects buzzing in your ears! However, I should add that in normal shooting situations, the LCD is excellent, and you can adjust the display brightness & contrast for bright daylight, so that's been pretty good.There are a LOT of external buttons on this camera, which is convenient once you learn what they do, but it takes some patience and a willingness to dive deep into the documentation. Some of them function differently depending on the context, or in combination with other buttons--common with new technology these days, but still a challenge for anybody older than 25. It's also sometimes difficult to find settings in the on-screen menus, but again you do learn with some practice. When you don't want to fool with all the options, just set it to one of the program settings and start shooting.As some have noted, it's a pain to turn on the camera and get about 15 insistent beeps while the zoom lens bumps into the lens cap and retracts. I've trained myself to avoid this most of the time by a) removing the lens cap *before* powering up (duh!); and b) in case I forget to remove the lens cap, making sure the mode selector dial is in \"review\" position before powering up, since the lens doesn't extend when you power up in that mode.Bottom line--would I buy this camera again? Not being a rich person, yes. (Or, for the less geeky who are willing to sacrifice bells & whistles for ease of use, I'd recommend the Sony DSC-W5.) It would be much better to have through-the-lens focusing, and I'd love to have a good long-range zoom lens for wildlife photography. But for most situations, the Olympus C-5050Z is a great camera. And I saved enough buying it to justify buying the excellent Epson R800 printer, which can produce archival-quality prints that are instinguishable from \"real\" photos. And now I have a Mac with Photoshop CS software, so with this suite of equipment, I can produce some truly stunning images. (I also got very good results from the same printer with my old PC with PaintShop Pro and the Olympus Camedia software).I look at this as a camera to tide me over for a few years until good digital SLRs become plentiful and less expensive. Then I'll be in the market for an upgrade, but until then I expect to have many more pleasurable outings taking pictures with my C-5050Z.", "Date": "August 22, 2005"}, {"Title": "From 640 to 2560 px!", "Author": "Digital Gadget", "ReviewID": "RPXUWIEA3WA31", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "My interest in digital photography began with my mother's Sony Mavica FD-75.

I've been waiting for the digital quality to match the quality of film before spending this kind of money on a new camera. My family has a 2MP Olympus that we have used for vacation photos and snapshots, and the quality of those pictures is what has kept me from using a digital camera for more serious work. When Canon released the EOS-1Ds, I thought that was the perfect digital camera, albeit with a price ten times higher than this Olympus. I thought nothing short of the 11 mega-pixel Canon would produce images nice enough to fool any normal viewer. I have read many of the reviews posted here and elsewhere and even have a relative who uses this model, and after reading what they all had to say I decided to take the plunge and go digital. Out of the box, the pictures this thing takes are amazing. With the right system tweaks, the pictures are shockingly good. I usually print 8x10 inches on an Epson printer, but the pixel count is high enough for larger prints. Even better than the resolution, though, is the amazing clarity and detail you can capture with the nice lens of this camera. Admittedly, you have to turn  down some of the camera's sharpening and ISO settings for the best quality, but you would use slower film for smaller grain in any camera. The RAW option is also nice if you want to export directly to Photoshop in 16-bit mode (the Olympus web site has a RAW Import Photoshop plug-in available as a free download), or you can shoot TIFF files (very large file sizes!) for the best quality 8-bit pics. The range of manual overrides is the best thing about the camera as far as I'm concerned - few serious photographers want the camera to do all the work - and the auto modes are simple enough for any family member to use. An all-metal body gives the camera a \"pro\" feel, too. If you want to show prints to your friends and family that make their eyes pop, you will not be disappointed with this camera.

Still solid after all these years.", "Author": "Puzzled Panther", "ReviewID": "R3NPIA8L9HR9D", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "My very first digital camera was an Olympus C-3000 that I acquired in the year 2000.  My employer was nice enough to give it to me, which was awesome since at the time the C-3000 was a $900 purchase!!!  I LOVED this camera and used the dang heck out of it for eight years, and then the stupid lens-motor-thingy finally broke.  It's not like Olympus had an eight year warranty on the thing so just try to imagine how I felt when I realized that I'd have to spend my own money on a digital camera for the first time ever.  And I NEEDED a new camera fast.So I did some recon on electronicBay and managed to pick up a C-5050 with a butt-ton of accessories for about a-hundred-fifty bucks.  I had become so intrinsicately brain-melded with my C-3000 that I was totally afraid to buy a camera with a different menu system.  Plus, the C-3000 had been such a champ.  I'd dicked around with other fool's digital cameras over the years, and I was ALL ABOUT the old-school Olympus menu system as opposed to a lot of the tom-foolery of other brand's menus.  The Olympus menu was designed before digital cameras where an everyperson type of thing, and thus was psychically aligned with my ways of photographing: attention to aperture, shutter speed, depth of field, exposure time, etc., as opposed to the digital-era jargon of 'scenes', where you turn the dial to an icon that supposes to know what the sh you're supposed to be looking at.  Plus, whereas most digital camera makers were trying to lure customers with devices that looked decidedly new-era, all sleek and small, the C-Series Olympians were still about 'feeling like a camera'.  A solid, hefty body, with a good chunk of 'grip', and an optical viewfinder!  This was made for people who think of a photograph as something other than a jpg on the interweb.Right.  So I got the C-5050 in the mail and started effing around with it and let me tell you, I was PSYCHED!  I was seriously groaning at how dumb-awesome this thing is/was.  First of all, the C-5050 has just about every control that a mindful snap-shotter needs right on effing deck.  The external controls are not only the the controls you need to make the most of the moment, but they are made familiar with your brain by being laid out in such a way that is physically analogous to what it is you're trying to do.  That is to say, IT FEEEEELS RIGHT!  Eff the megapixels and the whatever complaints someone would try to hate on this thing with.  Even now it's awesome, in this beasty old type of way.  Let me say it again: THE EXTERNAL CONTROLS ARE REALLY, REALLY, REALLY USEFUL AND COMPREHENSIVE AND INTUITIVELY DESIGNED.Now there is definitely ONE thing that sucks about this camera.  The ON/OFF SWITCH!!!!  UGH!!!  In every way this camera was a quantum-effing-leap beyond it's predecessors, but the ON/OFF switch is the most dumbest ever.  If you own one of these you have either never used it at all agree with me hard. The on/off switch is positioned on this camera such that it flips on VERY easily.  And then what happens???  Well I'll tell you what happens: the lens motor starts to push the lens up and out of the camera, and if it meets any resistance (such as your jacket pocket, or the other object in your bag, or a dog's nuts) it makes this awful, horrifying grinding sound, and then the camera beeps at you as if its really bummed out that that just happened. Every time this happens you will wonder if it's the last time and if you finally ruined your awesome camera with that STUPID design flaw. For otherwise being such a thoughtfully designed device the on/off switch is incongruously craphouse.  This would be a Five-Star camera in every way except for this actually very annoying flaw.Okay, so it's 2012 and I just got a Fujifilm X10 and I am blown away by the thing.  If you've been doing some research and are considering the C-5050 versus the X10, do not be deceived by this review.  This thing is a total DOG compared to the X10.  But that really isn't a bad thing!  It's a good dog! A good, old, loves you the most after all those great times and will still be your best friend forever DOG.  The C-5050 is like a warm blanket, too.  It is a welcome set of constraints that gives you little choice but to craft the image yourself.  If you just want to point and shoot and you don't give a crap about capturing the photo 'your way', then this camera is a turd choice in 2012.  If you are looking to spend a few bucks on a (these days) budget camera that has the features that put you in control in an external, body-oriented, I actually sort of know how to use a film camera type of way, then you might want to give this thing a shot.", "Date": "November 11, 2012"}, {"Title": "Outstanding Quality with great control of settings", "Author": "Danny \"video-dan\"", "ReviewID": "R1566DNTXA8E9X", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "GREAT CAMERA:  I have owned many Olympus Digital cameras and I find this to be the best near pro model there is.

This is the second Sony digital still camera that I've owned and I've used a few more.  The other (2.1MPixel) unit that I had before suffered from the same crappy focussing system. The earlier Sonys that I've used were much better.Some pictures come out beautifullly sharp, and others are not well-focussed. The thing that really bothers me is that I know that it's not me, since I'm a very experienced SLR photographer and have very good success with almost all the other camera gear that I've used. And that it's not predictable... there is no one thing that I can nail down to being the cause. I can use a tripod, or go hand-held and it doesn't make much difference. Good things about this camera are the user-interface. Sony really has a great system that is quick to use, simple to understand and effective. This camera is also loaded with an excellent battery system, lots of manual and automatic features. It's really just one step below a true SLR in many ways. That's it... I like everything about the camera but the focussing system.", "Date": "February 9, 2004"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": "Unavailable", "Features": "5.0 megapixel sensor creates 2500 x 2000 images for high-resolution prints up to poster size\n3x optical plus 3.3x digital (10x total) autofocus zoom lens\nIncludes 32 MB XD Picture card--also compatible with SmartMedia, CompactFlash, and Microdrive cards\nMovie mode captures up to 148 seconds of video with audio\nPowered by 4 AA NiMH rechargeable batteries (charger included); connects with PCs and Macs via USB port", "Name": "Olympus Camedia C-5050 5MP Digital Camera with 3x Optical Zoom", "ImgURL": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51TGBYE15RL._SX300_.jpg", "ProductID": "B00006JLOS"}}
