{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Exactly what I was looking for", "Author": "Tom Swift", "ReviewID": "R1D6X52CC055YB", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I recently purchased the Panasonic Lumix LX5 and wanted some simple lens protection because I was going to be using it as my main camera at the beach.  This kit has everything I was looking for, the lens adapter, lens filter, and lens cap.  I like how the adapter specifically says it's for the LX5 (inscribed right on it) because it indicates to me that it will fit my camera (it better!) and it did.  I only wish it came in white to match my camera color, but this is only minor, certainly not enough to deduct any stars.", "Date": "September 3, 2011"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": "$45.99", "Features": "The package includes 3 items: 1) 52MM ***Pro1D*** SMC UV Filter 2) Metal 52mm Filter Adapter Tube + 3) 52MM Lens Cap\n52mm Pro1D Pro 1D Slim MC UV(W) Digital filter.
