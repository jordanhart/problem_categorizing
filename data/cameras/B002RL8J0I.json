{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Q-See 4-channel DVR card does the job", "Author": "William B", "ReviewID": "RG9LT2ZENKF76", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "With video surveillance systems with DVR and 4 cameras pricing out around $1,100, I was thrilled to discover this 4-channel PC card that comes with two cameras for around $200.  It probably would not have been such a deal if I had had to purchase a PC and graphics card, but I had both sitting around.  I've been installing accessory adapters since 5-1/4\" floppies were popular, so I had no trouble with the installation, but it really was not difficult.  The DVR software that comes with the product has a lot of features you would expect to find in something costing a lot more.  My only disappointment with the system is the remote access.  Initially, I was able to access the PC on the network and view live or recorded video.  But after moving it to another location, I seem to have lost that ability.  Q-See support is very poor.", "Date": "May 26, 2010"}, {"Title": "Ups and Downs, Good Price", "Author": "S. Fitzmaurice", "ReviewID": "R1IK5090W4PBV8", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "Pros:  If you already have a compatible computer, this is a nice, inexpensive way to get yourself some camera based security.Cons:  The motion detection system is pretty bad.  It seems to use software to detect changes in pixels rather than IR hardware.  The result can mean you get lots of false alarms.  I had a spider put a single strand of webbing across the view area, and any action that made the strand jiggle, also set off the motion detection.  The GUI is nothing to look at and will win no awards for intuitive design or ergonomics.Mixed:  I found Customer Service to be responsive if not particularly useful.  On the upside, you get a normal person on the phone.Other:  You'll need to have enough computer knowledge to handle a card installation.  Requires some beyond novice expertise to set up your router to accommodate mobile aps.  They work effectively once you do though.", "Date": "August 5, 2011"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": "$229.99", "Features": "Digital Video Surveillance Through Your PC (Connect up to 4 Cameras)\nAdvanced H.264 Video Compression\nCIF Real-Time Recording per Channel (Record & Display at 120/120 FPS)\nStream Live Video Directly to a remote PC, iPhone, or other Supported Smartphone Running Windows Mobile Pro or Symbian on 3G Networks.
