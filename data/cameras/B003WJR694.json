You really can't go wrong with any of the mega-zoom point and shoots - they all have their pros and cons.However, the Panasonic FZ-40 is probably as good as P&S;'s will get with the current technology.  Some day someone will figure out how to get a bigger and better sensor to work with a mega-zoom lens, but until then, the FZ-40 is my choice.This camera is easy to use, quick focusing, and has all the manual adjustments and flexibility you will ever need.  It's well-designed and built for the active photographer.  It also has a long battery life, but finding replacement batteries is a problem that Panasonic needs to clear up fast!  Image quality is excellent compared to its competitors.  Image stabilization is outstanding, even at full 24X zoom I don't need a monopod or tripod (I need one with my Olympus SP-800).  The zoom is also quiet and smooth.  ISO looks good up through 800.  I'm still experimenting with macro shots - I'm not real happy yet, but it's probably me.  I can't tell a lot of difference between normal and fine JPEG's, except for the file size.  The EVF is very good - I can't live without a good view finder.  I've tried zooming in the wilds with an LCD screen, and it just doesn't cut it!All in all, I rate this camera as excellent.  I considered the FZ-100, but decided I did not need, nor want, the extra features.  Besides, I've always had good results with the small CCD sensors.I've posted some sample pictures here in the customer images section.", "Date": "September 18, 2010"}, {"Title": "It's GORGEOUS", "Author": "Bird That Flew", "ReviewID": "RXN4F4T641DX5", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I bought this camera to replace my older Panasonic DMC-FZ28, which I adored but is no longer useable due to recently succummbing to the dreaded \"lens cap error\" message of death.  I told myself I'd never get another Panasonic because of it, but then I did some research and saw that several brands (including Canon) had this problem and that it seems to have been resolved in all the new models.  I loved my old FZ28 so much that I just couldn't resist getting its newest relative (with a 3-year warranty this time...just in case).  After having played around with my new FZ40, I feel I definitely made the right decision.I generally shoot things like plants in my garden and my animals (cat, horses), though I do a fair amount of indoor shots as well.  This camera performs very well where all are concerned.  It is way better in low light than the FZ28 was, and the flash is not so bright that it looks like you've got a spotlight on your subject when you use it.  The quality of the images in the LCD screen are incredibly crisp, and the big size makes it easy to review everything your shots.  This camera comes with a rechargeable battery, which I vastly prefer over AAs (in my experience, rechargeable battery charges last way longer).Most importantly, the pictures the FZ40 takes are flat-out awesome.  Crisp, clear, detailed, just excellent.  I was so excited to try this camera out that I wasn't being careful to hold the camera perfectly still when shooting.  Even so, there was absolutely no noise or blurriness in any of the shots I took, even in low light without the flash.  THAT makes me happy.Only a couple teeny tiny things I don't love but that aren't a big deal:  I don't love the lens cap.  Basically, tension holds it in place at the end of your lens and it just doesn't seem really secure to me.  I bought a holster-style camera bag for that reason, and hopefully it will offer a little extra protection for the lens when transporting.  Also, the review feature on the FZ40 is a separate button instead of an option on the dial like on older models.  I preferred it the old way, but it's no big deal.All in all, I am EXTREMELY pleased with this camera.  If that changes or if I notice anything noteworthy about it over the next few months, I'll come back to update.", "Date": "October 8, 2010"}, {"Title": "Beware if ordering filters for this great camera", "Author": "Ian Jennings", "ReviewID": "R2KI1QFWOXRAWQ", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "It's too early for me to give a full review as I've only had this camera for 2 weeks and took it on a vacation trip. First BEWARE. You need 52 mm filters for this camera, not 46 mm as Amazon suggests. Maybe the FZ35 had 46mm??? I've just had a 46mm polarizer delivered and it's too small.The zoom is amazing. When using movie mode, I zoomed right in from wide to telephoto and the focus was spot on the whole way. The camera is so light, which is why I chose it over the Canon equivalent. The batteries are expensive, but lasted a week and I filled a 4 Gb card before i needed to recharge. You can keep your AAA battery cameras, far too heavy to carry around for my liking.The manual focus override is useful. I'm struggling a bit with the various auto focus options on non-movie modes, so have been overriding until I learn more. the instruction manual(on CD) is a 233 pages long! The intelligent auto will suffice more often than not.There are too many features though. Like cars, cameras are just getting too damned complicated. It's the 80/20 theory I guess. I'll use 20% of the features 80% of the time. I'm sure any 8 year old kid will be able to show me how everything works though! How old am I? My first camera was an Agfa Sillette, I used flash bulbs!

I have displayed 38 photos in my \"Profile\".  Please review them to see the capabilities of the camera and software-click on Johnygolf.  I hope my review will help those contemplating this camera.  First, it's critical to understand what I was looking for: I wanted greater zoom capabilities than the pocket \"Point & Shoot\", greater flexibility for creativity (setting options), excellent picture quality, and DID NOT want to carry large lenses. If this is you... then the \"Super Zoom\" class of cameras is your target.  See [...] to understand your options.  Here is my assessment after 400+ shots.Overall, the above criteria with the FZ40 were easily met. The setting flexibility, macro/zoom capabilities, and picture quality are all very good.  Recommendations:  1) You MUST read the manual (on CD) to understand the camera's flexibilities and capabilities from IA mode to full manual modes.  2) To achieve crystal clear pictures, especially for macro type targets, use a tripod and \"timer\" settings with this camera. 3) Buy the Hoya HMC SUPER UV 52mm for lense protection, and Marumi DHG Circular 52mm P.L.D.  (Polarizer), AND the Panisonic SD HC Class 10, 4 GB card--ALL maximized cost and performance Note: I do not use the video feature of this camera-perhaps later.  4) Shoot in RAW.  Again, a step-up from \"Point & Shoot\".  The quality is noticeable in post production work on your PC.  I have taught myself the SILKY PICS software (CD w/ camera).  Not easy! Be patient... extremely worth it...similar to Photoshop.  It takes your pictures to a new level!  5) For \"kid\" pictures or needing to have a great quality shot in a time sensitive situation (animals), the IA mode in good quality light is excellent.Downsides:  The \"noise level\" in low light is very noticeable.  The Silky Pics \"noise reduction\" section helps here.  In low light, shooting at 400ISO, is not a good quality picture.  It took my rating from a perfect 5 to 4. (All though, I suspect other \"Super Zoom\" brands have a similar challenge because of the their sensor vs a  DSLR sensor).  In order to shoot in lower light, with an ISO of 80, 100, or 200, you must use a Tripod.  This is where moving up to a full DSLR (big boys) with a larger sensor may make a difference in low light and even crisper picture quality.The FZ40 is a great \"Step-Up\" from your \"Point & Shoot\" camera.  The price/value mix is very hard to beat!  The camera has allowed me to get back into creating landscapes and macro pictures that may challenge entry level DSLR's without lugging around the large equipment \"sack\".

I choose the Panasonic Lumix DMC-FZ40 14.1 MP based on the recommendations of a friend and my own research.  I consider myself an average amateur photographer that understands the basic workings of a digital camera.  I have used the camera for about 1 month and have taken 100's of pictures. The camera has met my expectations in terms of control of picture taking and quality of images.If you are considering purchasing a super zoom, I suggest looking at the manufacturers specifications and even downloading a user manual from the manufacturer's site, if available, so you can evaluate the features of the camera and whether it will suit your needs.Features that I use and like about this camera (these comments are not meant to indicate presence or absence in comparison to other brands of super zooms):* saves images in JPEG and RAW formats (and even both at the same time).  The RAW format allows you to have a greater flexibility in using photo-editing software than JPEG since it contains all the picture information captured by the camera's image sensor.* information about exposure controls can be shown both on the 3\" lcd screen and in the view finder.  Seeing information about exposure controls in the view finder is very handy and is especially so on bright sunny days.  However the lcd screen is bright enough to be visible in normal daylight situations.* you have great flexibility in controlling the camera: you can let the camera make all the decisions so you just have to press the button to take the picture or you can opt for a totally manual mode where you set the aperture, shutter speed, sensitivity (iso), white balance, control for camera shake etc...* flexibility in storing images: uses SD, SDHC, and SDXC memory cards* 24x optical zoom: from 4.5mm to 106mm.  35mm equivalent for a 4 x 6 picture is from 26mm to 624 mm.  This allows nice wide angles to telephoto closeups with good picture quality.  This is one of the main reasons for my supplementing my compact digital camera, which had limited wide angle and zoom features, with this camera.* battery easily lasted all day of picture taking (outdoors in mild temperatures). The manufacturer quotes 580 per charge but I have not taken that many in a day (around 100 or so). However, always a good idea to have a spare battery.* F stops range from F2.8 to F11 at wide angle and F5.2 to F8.0 at the tele end.Other Comments:* This camera has an intelligent auto mode which sets all the controls for you so that you just have to press a button to take a picture.  IA works fine but you should note that saving to RAW is not an option when using IA.  If you are the creative type and want to make decisions regarding controls it was important for me to read the operating instructions for advanced features (supplied on the included CD in pdf format) to setup the camera in order to get the highest quality pictures.  I found it pays to spend time understanding and then experimenting with the controls to get pictures of the quality I want.* While it is possible to set iso from 80 to 1600, picture noise (grainy appearance) becomes a problem for me with ISOs above 400 in this camera. If you plan to take a lot of your pictures in low light conditions without a flash (e.g. indoors)where there is movement (so you need a relatively high shutter speed and therefore a high ISO) you might want to consider digital slr cameras which have larger image sensors and lenses with lower f stops (i.e. F1.8 to gather more light) that would decrease noise substantially.", "Date": "November 17, 2010"}, {"Title": "Glad I waited for the DMC-FZ40!", "Author": "Jim", "ReviewID": "R1DF0OASAAHLIK", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I have been searching months for an inexpensive but good quality digital camera and have made the Panasonic Lumix DMC-FZ40 my choice.I based my purchase on image quality, range of zoom, ease of use, and price.

Because of the very long zoom, a tripod or VERY steady hand may be necessary for best results.It is packed with many features.  Most you will find yourself using.

Wright", "ReviewID": "R3FFE0F455YOOH", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I've owned the FZ40/45 for just over 2 weeks and it has been a joy to work with.I have owned point and shoot cameras before but this blows away anything I've previously owned. I decided to try my hand at photography and wanted to purchase a camera that had a relatively good price but with full manual controls. Having acquired the FZ40, I must say it is simple to use yet gives you a degree of control that you may want, if you envy the range of things you can accomplish with an SLR.Let me be clear, this camera is adequate for a beginner who seriously wants to try photography or the individual who does not quite want to make the jump to slr just yet but wants slr type control over their photos.1) The build quality of the Panasonic camera is top notch. I never like the flapping battery covers in any device but that is the norm.2) The zoom is of course a major attraction and it is beneficial in many ways. The vibration reduction works well and Panasonic's intelligent zoom and EZ zoom features are interesting. DO some research to find out about it. EZ zoom seems to be a mix of croping and refining and optical zoom and intelligent zoom.. is a mystery. They perform remarkably however.3) The picture quality is excellent, Color is perfect, all the features you could possible want are here, very similar to a dslr in fact. However if you plan to do a lot of low light shooting, and you don't want to use the flash, get a tripod. The Fz40 has a minimum shutter speed of 60 seconds which is excellent, superior even, for a camera in this class but the iso performance is average. ISO 80 - 200 has no noise. 400 has a bit but not very noticeable ( certainly would not notice it in a 4 x 6 print, depends on the picture as well) 800 Is a last resort and 1600 is unusable in my opinion.4) the aperture range is 2.8 - 8.0 depending on the focal length. This is normal for a camera in this class but.. can be quite limiting when trying to take slow shutter  pictures in daylight ( you will need a filter) because you can't f stop at over 8... meaning really bright pictures..(So purchase some Filters if you like this kind of photography)5) You can manipulate depth of field, fairly well with the camera but the manipulation takes a bit of time and practice, again, normal for a camera in its class but quite a ways off from an SLR.In conclusion the FZ40 is a very good camera, I would say perhaps.. top two in terms of a comparison for camera's like this. A lot of dslr features are here, it of course looks like an slr and for the most part will make you feel as if it is one but keep in mind that it isn't and you have to work within those limitations. It is a superzoom/bridge and in that roll it Functions PERFECTLY.", "Date": "November 21, 2010"}, {"Title": "Fantastic choice", "Author": "Hawks19", "ReviewID": "R2NYEO2E6L1BU7", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I bought this camera about a month ago and have used it an awful lot since.  It really is a great camera.  For those who are not able or willing to go for a DSLR, but want something a bit more substantial than the standard pocket size digital camera, this is a great choice.  So far I have been more than impressed with the results.  The pictures come out very clear and beautiful in color.  The effects you can apply with the camera are also very neat, they have resulted in some of my favorite photos so far.  The camera is also very easy to use.  If you use the Intelligent Auto setting the pictures come out great, and I can't get over how little camera shake there is even out at full zoom.The videos I've taken have also come out very nicely.  The sound is impressive and the picture is very clear.  I connect the camera right to my TV and play the movies, they look great on the big screen.  I haven't noticed too much wind noise or any noise from the zoom when filming video.  I love the one touch start and stop on the video as well, super easy.The camera is bulkier than a standard point and shoot, but nothing near as bulky as a DSLR.  It is a very attractive camera and the 3\" LCD screen is very nice, bright, crisp, and large.  The menus are fairly intuitive and the zoom works very well.  The battery so far lasts very long and the charge time is certainly reasonable.  Connecting the camera to the computer couldn't be easier.  A friend of mine commented that she wished she'd gotten something similar rather than her DSLR because that is just too complicated and bulky with all of the additional lenses.The only downside so far is that I need to figure out how to convert the AVCHD lite videos so they play at a normal speed on my Mac (iMovie), but I know there is a way to do it, I just need to research it.  If you want you can record in mpeg as well so it won't be an issue.In short I love this camera and I am extremely happy with my purchase.

Let me tell you why...After some research, I narrowed my choices to the Panasonic FZ40 and the Nikon P100.  I tried both cameras out. I loved the look and the feel of the Nikon but it fell short on features and image quality despite the CMOS sensor.  The Panasonic was superior in image quality and features in every test.  The Panasonic still pictures were clear and vibrant.  The Panasonic seemed to retain more detail than the Nikon.  The Nikon still pictures were nice but a little washed out.  Also, the Nikon seemed to have more chromatic aberration.  Video was a lot better on the Panasonic as well.  The FZ40 produced excellent video and audio. The Nikons sound was muffled and the noise it picked up from the zoom was extremely loud.  The P100 couldn't autofocus fast enough when using the zoom.  In summary, I am very happy with my purchase of the Panasonic FZ40.  It's feature packed, produces great quality stills and video, its lightweight,  and you can attach filters for more creativity!  Though, obviously not a DSLR, its a great bridge camera!  Recommend for someone that wants great image quality and some DSLR features. !  5 Stars from this buyer!", "Date": "December 7, 2010"}, {"Title": "FZ40 - Nice Super Zoom!", "Author": "ULong", "ReviewID": "R13CI65685XT4J", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Remember: There is always a distance between reality and expectation/imagination.Frankly speaking, I am just a novice amateur in photography, so if you're like me, read on...otherwise you may skip this and read my updates at the bottom.At first, I thought I would get a decent DSLR, like D90, it would look cool with it on the shoulders, but the price keeps me away.  Actually price for D90 is going up! (demand and supply rule, I guess?). Consider the body plus lenses, it easily costs me $1500!  That's big commitment. At my level, a bridge camera seems most appropriate.I've been searching for compact camera under $400 (the limit I gave myself) for a couple of weeks before I came with a short list of three super zoom cameras: Panasonic FZ40, FZ35 and Fujifilm S200EXR.  I prefer shooting birds to shooting night scenes, so I gave up on cameras like LX3.  I also gave up on those without RAW mode.When I read S200EXR reviews, I was excited about its unique features.  I even downloaded the manual and printed it out. I was just waiting for the price drop down, but it was the day before I made the final decision I happened to learn something about HDR.  It seems to me most of those sample images come out of S200EXR are kind HDR images, which I can do by myself with software, maybe even better since I can control the settings.  I might be wrong here.  Also, both FZ35 and FZ40 have High Dynamic mode (but I'm not sure they are comparable or not).  According to those reviews,  S200EXR is better than the other two in low light condition (?).  But I don't think it will help with the long zoom end anyway.  Besides I will use the camera mostly during the day (with good light) in the nature.  If I really need one for low light, I would get a LX3.  Another thing, Adobe doesn't support its RAW format! (due to its unique sensor, maybe?) Although there is a convertor out there, I don't feel comfortable.  So S200EXR was scratched from my list.Next thing is that, according to most of the reviews, FZ35 has better IQ than FZ40, but its price is getting higher lately!  Is it against me or what? I guess it's mixed with some truth and some tricks (i.e. strategy to get rid of the old stocks).  One thing I don't feel comfortable is the joystick, never used this kind of thing.  Again, the day before I made the final decision, I found some decent images come out of FZ40/45 at flickr.com, so I thought FZ40 is new, loaded with more goodies, and with the price getting narrow between FZ35 and FZ40, this is at least a good deal (last check FZ35 is even more expensive than FZ40!!!).  Besides some average IQ images out there are most likely due to users' skill, not the camera (I would hope).  Another thing is the Leica lens (Germany brand, might be made in Japan? Either way is superb).  So much for the searching, I put an order as soon as the price dropped to $349.99 at Amazon.com...the price keeps dropping!Waiting is finally over, delivery is fast for free service as usual.  I was so happy yesterday when I got my new \"toy\" (pretty light and small in hands, I had Nikon CP995 which is much heavier than this one), made in Japan (meaning good quality itself).  While waiting for the delivery, I downloaded and printed out the manual (it comes with the camera on one of the two CDs, not printed, save some tree or go green?), I think it's helpful to get familiar with those new features first.  I don't want to list those pros and cons here since many reviews have already done so.  I played with it last night, I found AF is not working well in low light (as explained and expected), I tried MF and it turned out pretty useful.  I also like the custom settings, you can save three different settings for later use, which are pretty handy feature.  iA  mode is pretty cool, I got some decent sharp images in low light, but unfortunately you cannot use RAW for this mode.  Auto Bracket is easy to set and use, but again not available for RAW (this is odd, maybe due to the processing limit?). I think a tripod (or at least monopod) is a must-have for this camera to get sharp images (especially for long zoom end).  So far so good, the menu is intuitive, the buttons are easy to reach but small, I guess I have to get used it.  Time will talk. I hope the weather here will be nice this weekend so I can go out and play more.  I might have to update this review with more findings later.Talking about something else, if you don't want/need super zoom, LX3 or even LX5 (if money is not an issue) is a very good camera (just my feeling by reading all the reviews and pictures), but they belong to another class though.  Technology is changing quickly, more and more new stuff will come out , who knows what's like in five years, ten years. I would hope compact camera with bigger DSLR-like sensor will be a trend to watch.  Also, it would be interesting to see how far Micro Four Thirds can go.  This is just my opinion. For now I'm going to enjoy shooting with my new toy...Hope this will help some people like me make a decision (right or wrong, it's your money after all).Cheers!---------------------------------------------------UPDATES:PRINTS:I just got a chance to have some prints.  I have one of bees photos (cropped to size 1168 x 1557) printed 8 x 10 at Costco, very (not super) sharp and detailed.  Not to mention those 4 x 6.LOW LIGHT PERFORMANCE:Let's be fair.  Let's compare apple to apple, not to orange.  Those good low light performers, like LX3, only have 2.5x zoom, and have up to f2.0 aperture, so to compare I used f2.8 (the largest aperture of FZ40, no zoom), I got decent sharp images! When using zoom, it requires more and more lights, so use large aperture, you won't be disappointed.  Also, keep ISO as low as possible.  I used up to 400.  See some night scene photos I posted.Close-up mode works well in low light (indoor), I got sharp images consistently (handheld, 2 sec self-timer helps), even with 20x zoom sometimes.VIDEO:Simply amazing! Sound is great!RAW:Some RAW files (size 3244x2436) are not recognized by ACR. I think this happens when using i.Zoom feature with full zoom, not sure maybe a bug or by design?FYI: regular RAW file size 4320x3240, I got different size raw files, but ACR won't recognize anything around 10mb. Maybe this is an issue that ACR should take care.Not available in some mode, e.g. iA mode.  Writing RAW file is slow, a couple of seconds (I use Class 10 16GB sdhc card).

The camera performs well in low lighted areas, if flash is used its fill in is great. The optical zoom works well. In the movie mode it takes great videos and the sound is among the best, there are two formats MPEG2 Quicktime and AVCHD Lite. (After Reviewing MPEG2 vs MPEG4 I am finding The Quality of the video  of MPEG2 wins hands Down for Large Screen TVs).  The battery holds up good in the picture mode.  The Cons The pictures get grainy in the digital zoom , however with 24 optical you don't need digital.  The Text stamp has no on and off You stamp them after Picture is taken on camera  wich also reduces megapixels,in panasonic software on computer you may Date stamp without loss of pixils, the images in IA mode have excessive red in them and , The movie mode does not have MPEG4 or AVI.  AVCHD is a very limited use format. Movies taken with other Cameras with avi or MPEG 4 will not show up on the Panasonic Software. In the Movie Mode battery life is short, and the battery seems priced 70% Higher compared to The FZ35 or other cameras.  Generic Batteries will not show the battery level in the FZ40. I have recently Tried other Cameras out,the FZ35 took great looking Pictures with nice color. The FZ100 produced dull color along with some noisy pictures and also had some noise in the viewfinder in low light,  the firmware update being blamed by some is already on most new fz100s.  The Nikon P500 looked great and had nice image quality however the image stabelization could not match the FZ35 or the FZ40,and the wife said no.  The FZ40 takes great pictures in the P mode-auto  and has much more to offer when your ready to venture into other modes and options.

I started with mid-to-higher-end cameras back in the early 70's and most recently have owned Canon, Nikon, and Kodak digital point & shoot so I do have some experience (although definitely not an expert).  Obviously 300 pictures is not a true test but I wanted to contribute in case some of you are sitting on the fence regarding this purchase.I'll summarize first. This is a great camera overall. Ease of use is excellent and in the Auto-Intelligence mode and Program mode it is truly a point & shoot camera. All the flexibility is there for the more advanced picture taker but I'm thinking most will use those two modes (and perhaps Macro which is also automatic in the Ai mode). Straight out of the box this camera will take excellent pictures; better in my opinion than comparably priced competitors. Here's a quick list of pros and cons although please keep in mind that one person's \"cons\" may in fact not matter at all to someone else:Pros:Ease of Use plus flexibility for more advanced useGreat Battery Life & Fast Start-upExcellent image quality at the most common ISO (80-400)Fast & Quiet zoomPowerful Flash (compared to competitors)Faster Lens (compared to competitors)Cons:The battery must be removed for charging. Although it lasts a long time between charges, I would prefer the battery be chargeable in the camera. As noted by others, the battery is very expensive. It's good but not $40 good.As with most point & shoots, this is not a \"low light\" camera. ISO settings above 400 will begin to introduce noise - especially so with extended zoom settings.The AI mode is not particularly flexible. Raw Image is not allowed and setting a particular megapixel size is restricted (just alternate between Program & AI seems to be the best approach)The manual is far to complicated and jumps around a lot. The included software is better left uninstalled (there are better free alternatives).I looked at every camera out there that falls with the FZ40's price range and the quality & flexibility per dollars with this camera is outstanding. There's a reason 86% of the customer reviews are 4/5 stars. One bit of advice - buy a 52mm UV filter when you buy the camera. It's great protection for less than $15.I'm rating this camera at 5 stars even though it does have some flaws. All cameras have some flaws so it boils down to \"what you get for the money\".

The functionality of the camera technology is amazing.  Maximizing the utility of the camera does, however, require study.  The documentation is excellent, and even includes what the camera will not do (usually as the result of a preset nullifying some functions).  The camera is too much for the casual, point and shoot photographer.I cannot offer sophisticated comparative camera data, but am doubtful that you would wish for additional features were you to purchase the FZ40.  The posted complaints are virtually hollow and in some cases dumb.  Technology, by the way, has not overcome the visible noise inherent in low-light digital photography.

I purchased it new from Amazon and it arrived quickly - one day early actually.I read through the \"Basic Operating Instructions\" before unpacking my new camera.The enclosed battery & charger is compact.This camera is replacing a Kodak point and shoot.  I wanted something a bit more advanced and plan on taking a basic digital photography class.I was impressed when I turned it  on an looked at the LCD screen at how the wide angle captured my room wall to wall.  I have a few rental properties and this will certainly take much better photos for the purpose of advertising my rental homes.  I would recommend this camera to the real estate professional.I found the menu and function buttons easily intuitive.  I did not need to refer to the manual to set the time and date.  I  took my first few photos with ease and was able to play them back and delete unwanted photos with out referring to the manual.I was also impressed with the color and clarity of the photos.  Even if I never learn to use all the functions of this camera I am already satisfied with it.  I think a photography class would benefit a new user with the manual functions though.The FZ40 is a great looking camera.  If your not a pro  you will look like one holding this baby !I don't think it is heavy for a super zoom, but it is bulky compared to the point and shoot style cameras.The difference between the Z35 and Z40 - I believe it is the lens (you get a larger range with the 40) and the mega pixels (12mp for the Z35 and 14mp with the z40).  For a few bucks more  ($40) I decided to get the upgraded  FZ40 model.The Lumix  Z100 has an LCD screen that pops out and rotates.  This can be a great benefit to a more advanced user but I was not willing to spend the extra $120 for this feature.  The lens is apparently the same on the Z40 & Z100 according to some of the Amazon reviews.The Panasonic Lumix FZ series (Z35, Z40, Z100) all received excellent reviews on Amazon by consumers.  Consumer Reports Magazine, December 2010 issue had Panasonic cameras rated as the least likely to fail.I highly recommend this camera if you are interested in a super zoom for a great price with lots of manual functions.I will update my review as I learn more about using this camera and plan on posting some photos. I live in the Blue Ridge Mountains and they are filled with beauty.UPDATE - well it's the end of 2013 and I still love this camera.  It's easy to use, quickly uploads my pics to iPhoto and takes amazing  photos with great detail.  The only improvement I could ask for is shutter speed, but it's not bad for the price point.  This camera is fairly light.  I take it on short hikes and photograph wildlife in the Blueridge Mountains. Great zoom feature. I also use it to photograph my folk paintings ( I sell them on etsy & ebay and the camera gets the colors true under the proper lighting).

First off, I only gave it 4 out of 5 stars because no camera is perfect, and this one isn't either...BUT, it is exactly what I want so far.  I have played with it for several days and have taken quite a few pictures and I am thoroughly enjoying its features and the images I am getting.  I am a mom with boys in sports and wanted a long zoom for basketball and lacrosse pictures.  The basketball is very challenging given the indoor conditions and poor lighting, but am anticipating the lacrosse will produce better pics.I purchased the Canon SX30IS which was top of the line, and about $150 more with tax and all.  That camera produced pretty poor general pictures and I was really disappointed in it.  If I am going to spend $400, then I want a good quality picture.  But, the pics inside in low lighting were terrible - and I used several different settings.  The zoom was wonderful on that camera, however, although it wasn't able to get the action shots I wanted (and I don't know that this one will either).  Keep in mind that I am NOT a photographer and love the \"auto\" setting the best, but my thoughts on why I like the Panasonic better are:PROS:- much lighter (I didn't think this would be an issue for me, but now that I see how much more compact the Panasonic is I love it!).  The Canon was really heavy....- To me the buttons are easier to maneuver - pop up flash, one button movies, easier to switch to display pics and easier to delete pics.  I am a Canon girl, historically, as that is all I have owned so I assumed the Canon would be easier for me, but the SX30 just wasn't for some reason.- General images are much better - the flash made everything orange in my Canon and I don't have that issue with this camera.  I am surprised about how good the images look even in lower light.- Good zoom (not as good as the Canon, however).  But, with the Canon extended all the way out I simply couldn't get a clear picture anyway so I am not exactly sure if that zoom is worth it.  I didn't use it with outdoor sports (since it is winter) and the zoom I am sure would be worth it in that scenario.- Burst shots are much better - can take several right in a row (not as fast as the CMOS sensor cameras, but much better than the Canon which was SLOW!)- It just seems more fun and easier to use in general.  I know that isn't a \"professional\" opinion and if you want that kind of review you need to look somewhere else, but it this camera doesn't make me feel like it is an SLR camera in size/use yet you don't get that quality of pics.  The Panansonic doesn't feel at ALL like an SLR, but the quality of picture is still better.- Price point.  Bottom line, for $150 less I will put up with some pictures that are not top quality.  At the Canon price I want a great picture and it just didn't deliver that consistently.CONS:- You have heard it before, but the manual stinks.  Very basic, on the computer, yada yada yada....not much help.- The auto focus sometimes has a hard time focusing.  I have this as a con - may be user error.  Not sure yet.- The stabilizer when zoomed out seemed better on the Canon.  It didn't seem as \"shaky\" as the Panasonic.  However, I have still been able to get a couple of good shots on full zoom but will need to continue to play with it as it certainly is not consistent.- I like the Canon software better - but I have always had Canons and so am used to it.  Still trying to find a way to only import \"untransferred images\" and of course the manual has not helped with that.  That was a nice feature on the Canon and am hoping to find it with the Panasonic.THINGS NOT SURE OF YET:- Battery life- downloading movies- how pictures will printSo, for all you non-professionals photographers this is a basic review from someone who just wants to take some good pictures with a great zoom.  I have enjoyed it very much so far and would recommend it highly.", "Date": "January 10, 2011"}, {"Title": "Light and Easy", "Author": "Iconoclast", "ReviewID": "R1RTWWSHO0O1QI", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "This review might not be in the same league as some, but I have considerable experience with photography and have owned cameras of many types for nearly 60 years.  In reading about the camera, I was impressed by the feature set as well as what others had said online, particularly a very serious camera review critic that gave it top marks.I think the camera is a superb value for the money and the pictures I have taken thus far are completely satisfactory, but the software provided by Panasonic has been a bear. Neither of the enclosed CDs would install. I found a pdf of the manual online and have tried to download the photo management software. It works but only up to a point.Panasonic seems to have rushed this unit to market because the manual makes an enormous fuss about only using the recommended battery and it is not yet available.  The LCD screen protectors that were shown to be the right ones for this model were way too small. The same was true about the camera bag so the specs provided to the makers of these accessories need to be corrected, but these are minor issues. However, unlike my Nikon 8700, the LCD screen cannot be safely tucked away.  I miss that feature.Because I still only have the original battery and have not got all the paraphernalia for taking the camera out, I have mainly been using the camera indoors for product photography and a few shots of pets.  I think it is taking very fine pictures.  Overall, I would recommend this camera to anyone who likes the idea of a super zoom and HD video.  My goal had been to catch more pictures of bees, butterflies, and hummingbirds as I have a small herb garden for nourishing pollinators and wild life and I like to document who prefers what and when they move from plant to plant.  In six months, I am sure I will have more to say, but amazon.com will not be nagging me to review this when spring arrives.I would not describe this camera as rugged.  It seems to be very light construction but nevertheless well made.  I tend to take good care of my cameras so we'll see how well it holds up to major use.", "Date": "November 26, 2010"}, {"Title": "Panasonic FZ40", "Author": "lalala", "ReviewID": "R1A2VPACK1M3IR", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "First I should point out, although I give this four stars, the camera is one of those following the trend to buff up the specs of resolution and zoom, as these two are what the average consumer considers most important. However, most of the added resolution is pointless because of the small sensor. I was considering a bridge camera before getting myself a DSLR and thought this could be a good camera to learn. However, as I learned more about cameras, I realized these mega-zoom cameras are really in the extreme to buff the consumer cared specs (resolution & zoom) as much as possible, even if by compromising image quality. Although the zoom can prove to be very useful in certain cases, personally I think the extra pixels beyond 10M would be noise. For those who want a nice bridge camera and don't care so much about the zoom, I would suggest looking at the Panasonic Lumix LX5 or the Canon Powershot S95, or the Canon G12 and Nikon P7000 if you want some OK zooming capabilities.Because of the aboved mentioned reasons, I seriously considered returning the camera after taking a few indoor shots. The pictures taken have lots of noise viewed with full resolution. For example, the white wall has lots of yellow tinge on it. However, before returning it I gave it another chance and took pictures outdoors with fairly good light. I would say the end result surprised me and I decided to keep it. The images are surprisingly sharp (probably due to the partially Leica lens?) even at >10x zoom, and most pictures are usable up to 70% of their full resolution. Some closeups of flowers are very successful too. I would say this is much better than what I saw from a Canon SX20IS, the pictures taken by which tend to be very soft. The pictures taken using the FZ40 have bright and vivid colors viewed from my 27 inch iMac, with lots of details revealing, even if I turn the brightness of the display way down. However, if I put them on my old Dell studio laptop, the colors look washed out. I don't normally print out pictures very often so I don't know whether the quality on a print-out is closer to my iMac or my old Dell laptop. As long as I view them from my iMac, I am happy.So bottom line is, I think this is a great camera for those who are not serious about taking indoor pictures or pictures without ideal lighting condition. The mega-zoom really provides flexibility and the possibility of taking pictures that are otherwise impossible (consider the price-tag for the lens with such flexibility for a DSLR camera). So I really don't want to give up the flexibility to take acceptable pictures under good lighting conditions using only one lens and decide to keep it. Maybe I'll get myself a LX5 or S95 to complement this, and eventually an entry-level DSLR (but that would mean $$$ for the lenses). For those who are still debating which camera to get as a bridge camera, I'll recommend S95 or LX5 over this for image quality (at least from what I see online), also the FZ35 for better value. The added pixels over the FZ35 really don't matter, if not worse. They are all noise for such a small-sensor camera. I also don't use zoom a lot more than 10x because of hand shaking. So I think the resolution and zoom of the FZ35 is probably enough for most cases and it is very difficult to do better than that in real life at this class of cameras, regardless of what the spec of the camera tells you.For what it does and casual use, the Panasonic Lumix FZ40 delivers quite well, and I think it is one of the best in this class. From the FZ40 to the LX5, Panasonic is doing a fantastic job in the point & shoot segment, where big names such as Canon seem to be only taking advantage of its name and don't put much effort into. If you are interested in a mega-zoom camera, you can't go wrong with this.

It has a solid feel, handles very well, and while I have not mastered all of its features yet, it appears to be what I am looking for in this type of camera.My biggest hesitation about purchasing it stemmed from the battery issue.  Insisting on using its own brand of battery is fine, as long as the battery is available to purchase.  This appears not to be the case so far.  In my opinion, it is inexcusable to release a camera, knowing that there will be a demand for additional batteries, and not having the batteries available.

The battery issue is important, but I did not want to take anything away from the camera itself.Panasonic did a good job in delivering a feature-rich camera, with very reasonable performance, at a relatively inexpensive price.

I researched extensively and narrowed it down to the Canon SX30IS, the Panasonic DMC-FZ40 and its cousin the DMC-FZ100.  I was predisposed to Canon based on my history with them, and I would have probably been fine with any of the three.The SX30IS and the FZ40 have a CCD sensor, while the FZ100 has a CMOS sensor.  The CMOS strength is speed (FZ100 has 10FPS burst) while the CCD is generally regarded as having better picture quality.When I was shopping (Dec-2010), the FZ40 was $300 while the SX30IS was $370 and the FZ100 was $400.  I liked the speed aspect of the FZ100 and the potential extra zoom of the SX30IS (35x vs 24x), but because of the price differential and the glowing reviews of the FZ-40 (and the previous model FZ-35) I decided on the FZ-40.I've owned the camera about a month and have had the opportunity to take a wide variety of pictures and videos.  I have been extremely impressed with the functionality available in this $300 camera.  The zoom is fantastic and the image stabilization makes it much more useful.  I've been very impressed with the image quality as well.  I got some pictures of the lunar eclipse on the winter solstice that turned out great.  I've had many excellent outdoor day shots.  I've had some great Christmas light shots.  Indoor sports shots have been good, but not great, under challenging lighting conditions.  The modes help a lot but can only do so much.  Stick to ISO400 or less if you can.The 720p videos work really well also, though I use it primarily for photos.  You can zoom during the video, which isn't always common in cameras.

We bought the Lumix-FZ40 to replace a Canon Powershot S31 (suffering the dreaded lens error) and a Sony digital camcorder which needed expensive servicing.  The most important feature for me, other than great pictures,  was the ability to download my family movies without demanding more of my older mac or needing to upgrade our tv to HD (one $$ at a time!).  The FZ40 came with a composite cable which allows me to record to my DVR and archive my movies to DVD with ease.  The quality and sound are great.My first camera, a Canon AE-1, allowed me to do time lapse of night shots, something I've missed being able to do with digital cameras.  The FZ40 not only has the scene features many cameras have now (night portrait, beach, fireworks, portrait, etc.) but goes deeper with creative options.  The Starry Sky setting lets you choose between a shutter speed of 15 sec, 30 sec, or 60 sec (knowing that would have sold me right away)!  Portrait lets you choose between normal, soft skin, in- or outdoor, and creative, where you can adjust your depth of field.  Night portrait also has settings for night scenery or illuminations.  Color Mode has several options such as film grain, retro, and the ability to increase or decrease saturation.  I still have a lot to discover and tend to fumble on the fly trying to remember where to find the creative setting I want to use, but the intelligent auto setting is great for most shots.Another small feature I can appreciate, the lens cap fits inside of the rim of the lens, so I'm less likely to get the lens off track by turning on the camera before I remember to remove the lens cap.  Also, because the lens has threads, I can use the filter set I had for my old AE-1 (52mm)!I will eventually buy a back-up battery, (hope those become easier to find and cheaper) but so far I've only charged once since the initial charge (just before Christmas), and I've taken hundreds of pictures/movies of Christmas reunions, unexpected snow and a beach trip.I researched this purchase carefully and feel like I bought the right camera at the right price.", "Date": "January 5, 2011"}, {"Title": "Excellent substitute for a bulky D-SLR.", "Author": "Todd Clifford Kenyon", "ReviewID": "R18V9UZHS37MZV", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I purchased this camera to replace my aging D-SLR.

If you want to purchase a camera that will match those thousands but only costing hundreds, than this is the camera.Think about it, what is a camera? It's a lens, but the digital cameras add more to this as there is no film but a program created to capture images through data. Is the lens still important? You bet it is as all data comes through the lens. This camera utilizes the Leica lens. If you are from the old photography generation, like I am, you will instantly agree that the Leica lenses are some of the best in the world. My daughter is a Neuro Scientist at Emory University and when we talked about the quality of my pictures using my new DMC-FZ40, she recalled that all of their best microscopes use Leica lenses.Anyone who can read and use a laptop or desktop computer can use this camera.

I like the size and weight of the camera. I have tried many of the different modes. The camera gives you vivid color, but I haven't been able to get beautiful detail in things like leaves and other scenery. The pixels look a little fake. The pictures look better on the LCD screen than they do on the computer screen. It looks like when you blow up a picture too big and you lose detail.(Like a camera without enough megapixels) Looks like it's out of register.(printing term) This camera should do better than it does at 8X10 prints. My old Olympus does better at this and it's only 7 megapixels. The manual is well written and the menu friendlier than most. There needs to be a way to better protect the LCD screen (which I rarely use). The aftermarket screen protector I bought won't stay on. The electronic viewfinder is okay, but I prefer an optical type. All of these types of cameras should have viewfinders. I've heard about all the bright LCD screens, but believe me when you are as close to the sun as we are in Colorado, sometimes you just need a viewfinder. This camera is pretty good in low light or on cloudy days. The zoom, like most of these cameras is good only to about 18 as the picture loses quality with any more than that. I looked at many cameras in this category for over a year. I almost bought the Nikon P100 (image quality looked good) but the reviews from \"The Professionals\" were horrible. Reviews from buyers were mixed. The FZ-40 was supposed to come out in August, of course being new there were no reviews, just previews. They were mostly good so I bought this camera on the image quality and reputation of the FZ-35. I paid the entry price of $399.00 knowing the price would come down in the future. But $75 within a month,that's ridiculous. Maybe Amazon would like to give me a special deal on accessories to balance the deal. Then there is the problem of not being able to buy an extra battery. Lucky that the battery does hold up very well. You can buy them in Europe and Asia, but not in the US. I quizzed Panasonic on this and they just gave me the run around. I told Panasonic they are treating the USA like a third world country. I told them that I hoped that the camera never needed service because I'd be afraid to send it to them. Also that I hoped someone made a reasonably priced aftermarket battery soon. Also I'd like to see a 12 volt charger for the battery as I'm often in the mountains with no way to charge them. I guess there is no perfect camera in this category, though I sure did read and study trying to find it. I think overall this camera is probably as good as any of them, with some nice features. I'll probably continue to learn more about it in time.

This is my second Panasonic camera. The first was the DMC-TZ5, which had great reviews, but was lacking in image quality, so I went into this purchase with a little bit of hesitation. My first choice was going to be the Lumix DMC-FZ100, but after reading multiple reviews from many different sites about poor image quality, I decided to to go with the FZ-40, even though the FZ-100 had so many impressive stats. I'm not going to get into any technical aspects of this camera in this review, as I feel that there are enough of them on this camera to be helpful if that is the information that you are seeking. I'm here to give a basic overview of the FZ-40. First off, let me discuss the physical camera itself. The build quality is excellent. The camera feels solid in the hands and, in my opinion, the layout of the controls are very user friendly. As with any new device, you have to familiarize yourself with the User Manual (which, unfortunately, is only on a disc). I found it helpful to put a shortcut to the manual on my desktop so that I may reference it whenever necessary. This is my first \"DSLR Type\" camera, so I really had no idea what all of the controls really meant at first. If you are not familiar with any of the camera lingo, I would suggest that you go out and get a book about the topic. I purchased \"Understanding Exposure\", 3rd ed. by Bryan Peterson. It opened my eyes and gave me that Ah-Ha! moment about what all of the controls were about and how to manipulate them to get the best picture possible. As far as image quality is concerned, this camera is very capable. After I had fine tuned the settings, the images that I have been taking are very good. One suggestion that I took from a photographer friend of mine is to not get your pictures developed by an instant developer or by a photo center such as Wal-Mart. Instead, I would either go to Costco, or if you cannot go there, use a reputable online service such as mpix.com. IT DOES MAKE A DIFFERENCE!! In my opinion, as far as the video goes on this camera, it seems to be very good. I have taken several videos and they looked great on my TV. So, if you want a solidly built camera that has great zoom, takes great pictures and video without the cost of a true DSLR, then I would highly recommend this camera. Just follow my advice and get to know the camera first before you pass judgement on it. Once you understand it, I'm sure that you will be extremely satisfied with this camera.

However, image quality is fine... you dont look at the picture and think you could have done much better...you just say that is a nice one! I gave it a 5 beacause it really performs as advertised.... the zoom is a winner! And if you are using it as a spy cam then there is intelligent resolution, which takes a picture with the digital zoom...up to about 200X and does all the sharpening you would do with photoshop or editing software and spits out a pretty decent photo for using digital zoom( only useful for spy cam, it is still a bit grainy and digitized to be considered art). The video records in any scene the camera shoots in... for example if you choose dynamic contrast, film grain, Black and white...the video records in that mode...which can make for some artistic clips. If you are familiar with video editing you could achieve the same results with your program...but it's nice that the camera performs as a short cut if you want to do those types of things. Also the battery life on this thing is amazing... I bought a spare battery but I cant imagine when I will need to use it...if you leave with a fresh battery I cant see you burning it out before bed...but I know some people may be trigger happy and take 500 pictures in a day... this thing is rated for 580 pics BTW.

This happened for photos taken in all light situations - clear sunny days and overcast cloudy days.If you're not too picky, images of many things (i.e. buildings, landscapes, signs) are acceptable, but I purchased the camera in order to photograph birds and other animals.  This camera produced photographs that were totally unacceptable.I later read that Panasonic cut corners on this camera by stuffing 14 MP photos onto a small sensor.  It's too bad.  My smaller DMC-ZS5 actually outforms my Canon SX10 in many aspects, including image quality.Bob", "Date": "January 17, 2011"}, {"Title": "Loving it So Far", "Author": "Art and Soul \"ACottageArtist\"", "ReviewID": "R19LWD50C5ZNH4", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I've owned this camera about 3 weeks now, and before that I owned a Kodak Z712, which did okay for several years, but progressively got worse when trying to focus on long zoom. I'm not a pro, just an enthusiastic amateur, mainly shooting wildlife, especially birds, and scenery when traveling. When I was researching, I didn't find much in this price range that seemed to be appropriate for photographing birds, not a lot of reviews. I've been very pleased with the shots I've gotten so far.....fantastic detail in feathers and fur.I didn't read the manual, just wanted to see how easy and intuitive it was to use right out of the box....no problem !! Easy transition from the Kodak. And much better pix already than what I was getting with the Kodak. Colors are good, and this is all just using the AF. Because of the subjects I take pictures of, I like to just pick it up and be ready to shoot really fast, and I can do that with this camera.One thing that bugs me is the lens cap.....it can be \"fiddly\" to get off and on.....I think they could have done better. When you want to get a shot fast, it can be a hassle getting it off....and tough to be sure it's on well when you're finished. Another thing I notice when shooting birds at the longest end of the zoom....when you take one shot, it seems to move a bit [maybe that's the action of the camera....or maybe it's just me pressing the button, but at the longest zoom, it can be difficult to \"find your subject\" again. I think a tripod is really necessary at the longest zoom, but I've been able to get very sharp pix without it..just by bracing against something..and a tripod is not always at hand when my painted bunting decides to come to the birdbath.  But I'll be taking a small tripod on my travels. A minor problem is that my right thumb sometimes slides down to the Display button.....and I've almost hit it while shooting....but I'm adjusting.Obviously, I plan to use this for travel photos, birds, etc. I haven't tried it indoors or at night, as I have other cameras I can use for that. And I am still exploring all the options, and look forward to doing some macro shots with it. [bugs, butterflies, flowers, etc]  I think the battery life is really good, just charging it today after taking lots of photos....more than I'd take in about 2 days of steady shooting on a vacation. I use the zoom and display a lot !! I like the idea that they include the charger in this package. It's about time they all started making it easier to accessorize these things. I got a Sandisk Extreme 16 GB card.....and it's working great. I've never had any problems with Sandisk cards. It writes to the card fast enough for me. I think I will be getting a second battery, though it may never be needed.  The camera is lightweight enough to carry easily, but has enough heft, and I like the way it fits in my average size hands. I like the viewfinder, I never buy a camera unless it has one....I can't see myself shooting wildlife through the LCD screen. I cleaned the screen initially, and now it does have some smudges, so it might benefit from a screen protector. I can see the LCD in normal daylight, haven't tried it in bright sunlight yet. I love how big the LCD is.....lovely to look at.  I think the average person who's not a pro, but wants a good camera that is easy to use for novices or beginners would enjoy this camera. I got it quickly from Amazon. I think the price is great for a camera of this caliber....and I'm not done exploring all it will do.

I've owned & used this camera for 6 months.  Once I started experimenting with the different modes, I was sold.I use this camera for business and travel.  For business, I mostly use the indoor/outdoor sports mode & for travel I use many other modes including: portrait, close up, burst, scenery, night portrait.  I have not used the camera on a manual setting.The camera takes phenomenal pictures.  From a sports action point of view, I can catch someone in mid action using full zoom in outdoor light.  Indoor light (ie, gymnasium) provides enough light to shoot decent pictures, but you have to be patient. If the subject isn't moving too fast, your pictures will turn out OK.  Using zoom will make the camera not focus fast enough to get a clear shot. It is better if your subject is standing still or posing & those pictures will turn out great.  Cover your flash a little & you'll find that you get a much better indoor shot.  Indoor action shots in low light are difficult, and 8 out of 10 are not in focus (low light, verging on dark).For travel shots, my outdoor zoom pictures are stunning (I've posted some).  I've captured birds in flight, close ups of animals where you can count the scales, and birds (herons & flamingos) that are at such a distance that I don't know if I have the shot until I see it after the picture is taken (see posted pelican picture - I didn't know the iguana was next to the pelican until I looked at the picture).All pictures that I posted were taken without a tripod & I was able to steady my hands well enough to get great animal/scenery pictures.All in all, this camera is a fantastic value for the money.  Many people on my last trip made favorable comments about my pictures (even the DSLR users).  The camera is small enough to carry around in a backpack & isn't too weighty (compared to a DSLR).

So after a lot of research, it came down to the FZ40 and the Canon SX20IS. Found a deal for the FZ40 on eBay for $250 with bonus case/memory cards and I jumped on it. No regret.This is one slick camera. The size/weight is perfect for me. It feels very sturdy and fits comfortably but not too bulky to be hung around my neck. The only thing I don't like is how cheap the connection compartment's flaps are. Feels cheap, but not really a big deal since I always use a USB reader vs. cable. All buttons are well positioned with a dedicated Movie button.

I love the 'Expressive' mode with the saturated colours, but a point to note is the flash is disabled when using this mode. Auto works well for me once outdoors or in well lit rooms.Video at any resolution is excellent, HD or lower, again once in the light. You can zoom the full range while recording and the stereo mics are great for voices, of course not really any good for music with highs and lows. The image stabilisation works very well, across the full range of zoom, but I would not rule out getting a tripod for the best shots. I usually press the shutter button half way to get it to focus before I take shots, random shots by just pressing the shutter button all the way down do not always come out sharply.The battery can go for at least 1.5 hrs HD video recording, and probably 400 shots at least without flash, I have not kept a proper count of the amount of shots as I recharge batteries regularly, not just when they are drained.When reviewing pics on the camera you can press the zoom out button and reach to a calendar to choose a date to see pics beginning on that dateThe camera lightens the flash in close up Auto shots so it is not too bright and washes out the picture.You can program peoples faces and names with their birthdays into the camera, so it will show a name on the box around their face on the lcd when taking a pic of them, I am not sure if this info is saved into the image data file also.CONS:It is disappointing when trying to take low light shots eg in restaurants, evenings on Auto with no flash. The exposure time in the night mode is too long so images are blurred when people move or your hand shakes. The video at night is very grainy/noisy and focus does not work automatically, sometimes even after pressing the focus button. It's annoying when during zooming with videos I have to press the focus button as the camera may take a while to refocus with the new zoom level. My old camera the Canon S5 IS did a better job at night time video and focusing, but it was not HD as this is.The burst mode only lets you take 3 shots, it is not continuous, so if you start to shoot too early you might miss what you are trying to get with the bursts. After it takes a burst the camera has to save the pics to the SD card and you cannot start a new burst until the saving is done. I started using video for everything I may have used the burst for before.I do not have a card reader so I empty pics off the cam via USB and it is pretty slow, 5 or 6MB/second according to Windows 7, with many gigs to take off this can take several minutes.It takes 3+ hours to charge a dead battery, this is why I bought a spare.The data cable connector in he camera is a non standard shape, so if you lose the cable you need to buy a new one from Panasonic or use a card reader on your computer.The locations of the pictures and video are separate and hard to navigate to the buried folders on the SD card.The glare lines from bright lights at night/indoors is annoying to deal with it is very pronounced on this camera just as on most other cameras, even with the lens hood on.Accessories:I ordered Panasonic DMW-BMB9 Lithium-Ion Battery for select Panasonic Lumix Cameras for DMCFZ100K and DMCFZ40K as a second battery since I read the generic/imitation ones did not show the battery meter on the screen. The new battery works just as well as the original that came with the camera.Sigma DG 52mm Multi-Coated UV FilterThe same lens cap fits well on the filter.I have two 16GB sd card (Transcend 16GB Class 10 SDHC Card (TS16GSDHC10) ) that works well with the camera. I like the idea of multiple 'smaller' SD cards vs fewer 'larger' ones so that in the unlikely event that one card does go bad I do not lose everything on them. I empty the cards pretty regularly off to my PC, backups are very important. I recommend having at least two copies of all your pictures/videos either on two separate internal hard drives or on an external hard drive, they are very cheap these days, a USB 500GB hard drive is about $70usd.UPDATE: 30 June 2013The good: I still own this camera and it performs the same.The bad: The strap loops have broken off on both sides about a year ago so I cannot use the neck strap or keep the lens cap tethered. The loop material is some kind of allow that became swollen and crumbled. I live in a tropical country but the camera is not exposed to any extremes.

Panasonic made a number of compromises to hit such a good price-point but in my opinion I think they did a great job.Image quality is usually at least good or very good. The camera focuses quickly and usually is very accurate. Care must be taken to press the shutter button 1/2 way to focus but even when I barely hesitate I still get good pictures about 90% of the time (OK it's not totally idiot-proof). The camera will track a moving object very effectively.  The zoom is fast and quiet. In good light you can get away with using a lot of zoom and still get decent pictures. Image quality deteriorates predictably as ambient light decreases - particularly at longer zoom. If you can stabilize the camera it is still possible to take some pretty respectable low-light pictures. Video is very good & easy to use. The LCD washes out in bright light but having a viewfinder pretty well makes that a non-issue to me. An 8gb card will give you more than 1000 pix at 14mp.PROS: very easy to use, good zoom, fast focus, good image quality, outstanding battery life, very flexible with nuerous modes & decent menus.CONS: typical shortcomings of a point & shoot - but this camera deals with them better than any other I have seen to date, for guys with big hands it's a little to easy to unintentionally hit some of buttons of the back of the camera, proprietary battery is needlessly expensive.NOTE: I bought an after-market battery and it worked just fine. Be slective and find one that specifically states that it works in a Panasonic camera. I have only 2 concerns. (1) the battery indicator does not work (2) the battery gave mush shorter useful life than expected (but certainly reasonable considering it was 1/5 the cost of the original).Overall I am extremely pleased with this camera and strongly recomend it.", "Date": "April 24, 2011"}, {"Title": "Camera is great", "Author": "John", "ReviewID": "R4RBK4SXUQ3JV", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I got this camera for my wife who just wants to take nice pictures without hassles so she sets it on automatic and away she goes.

I don't go anywhere without my camera.  That being said, the more I use the FZ40, the more I enjoy it.  Along with wanting to take better quality photos, I stepped up to the FZ40 mostly because of the consistently good ratings/reviews and the price.  I looked at other super-zooms but did not like what I read about the overall decrease in image quality over previous models, especially due to noise.  I also wanted a camera that could handle high contrast situations since my old camera (Fuji Finepix E550) could not.  I've taken a thousand or so photos over the last few months and am happy with the image quality, especially in high contrast situations.  Photos do tend to get noisy at ISO 400 or above.  Even though it includes decent software with anti-noise filters (SILKYPIX Developer Studio 3.1 SE), they either can't compensate with photos at ISO 400 or above or I'm doing something wrong.  I say \"decent software\" mostly because, as a Photoshop Elements user, I have no idea what most of the terms used in SILKYPIX actually mean.)I am also happy with the image stabilization.  I do a lot of hiking and so a tripod isn't practical.  I have a relatively steady hand but, except for anything near full zoom in low light, there isn't significantly noticeable blur even at shutter speeds of around 1/15 and ISO 100.In the little that I've used it, the Intelligent Auto (iA) function tends to slightly over expose.  But since I prefer to take raw photos using manual settings, this hasn't been an issue.To me, a class 10 card is a must with this camera.  Even with a class 10, at full resolution, each photo takes several seconds to write to the card.Even though this is secondary to me, videos with this camera are beautiful.  The only issue I've experienced is the sound of the zoom as you zoom in or out.  It's not overbearing but it is there.  In the few test videos I've taken, stabilization has worked beautifully.Battery life has been great.  While out hiking and far away from an outlet, I've been able to take 300+ photos in one day on the same charge.  That was a very pleasant surprise.  Panasonic says \"up to 580 shots per charge\" and I tend to believe them.Since I take a lot of photos in the snow, I will be able to say more when I see how it performs in the cold.

The Fuji HS10 seems to generally be seen as having better image quality than the FZ40 though without the zoom and other features.Firstly I will say I have only owned this camera for several days but have captured over a hundred images already - 99% of which without desirable lighting. I am an absolute beginner so am not yet aware of adjustments and such - strictly a point and shoot. I am eager to learn more about the camera but so far have been letting the camera do the work and am, for the most part, quite satisfied with this camera so far. I still question times whether or not I should have waited and grabbed a DSLR - either way I am getting good practice out there and at this point would recommend this camera to. :) I can manage 1/2 or 1/3 taking great shots with the zoom maxed so I suppose it comes down to how still your hand is - those with shaky hands will surely find difficulty without a tripod.4/5 because I have had a problem while the camera is writing a RAW image where I needed to turn it off/on for it to work again.

This new camera came with a CD for the operating instructions. Because I didn't want to print OR CARRY 155 pages of instructions with me to Morocco I called Panasonic to purchase an owner's manual. My choices were to either buy a basic manual (how to turn the camera on/off etc.) for $15  or buy the advanced manual for $54. I find it hard to believe a manual could cost that amount of money.

The other two kept having problems with the flash.  Popping up the flash didn't make the software in the camera recognize that the flash is available and the cameras would still think the flash was closed and thus the indoor pictures were not great without flash.  I'm not paying $300 for a camera whose flash doesn't work.  the lightness of the camera combined with the advance features and super zoom does make it a great camera but I think Fuji has a problem with Quality of the first batch they produced.  I'd like to buy another one again but I'm afraid that I'll get another camera with the same darn flash issue that's plagued me 2/3 times and it's so annoying to have to return them though the AMazon return process has been very smooth and I got my refunds without issue.

Since the word \"best\" is subjective, it depends on what your priorities are (small compact size, or highest quality image, or cheapest price, etc), but our priorities were basically as much quality and features for price under $300. I got this camera back in October 2010 (just a month or so when it came out), and had a good chance to use it.PROS:1. Great quality photo and best quality video recorder in a single camera for under $3002. Numerous options and flexible features for taking photos3. Looks cool like an expensive SLR, but smaller and compact (and a lot cheaper) than an SLRCONS:1. Too many options and features for the time I have to read the 215 page PDF document2. There wasn't an apparent distinction between photos and videos, so when we were going through the numerous photos and deleting the bad ones, we inadvertently deleted a lot of videos because the first frame that was representing the video did not show that it was a video (I think you have to manually look for the display option to view a video icon)3. Did not know that if you have the Burst Mode on (where you can take rapid pictures), the flash is disabled. I thought it was an apparent defect, especially reading the other review about it (he may have it on too). This could just be a well known thing if one has the knowledge and experience in photography, but I'm just a beginner.Panasonic said that the memory card was optional, but without one, you can only take about 6 or 8 photos depending on the resolution quality setting you have it on (I had the default one), so it is absolutely imperative to buy a Flash card. And keep this in mind: not all flash SD memory cards are the same. You spent good money on a quality camera, so don't buy the cheapest memory card you can find because there are different \"classes\", or speeds, that write to the camera. I highly recommend the new Class 10 version that allow you to take many photos rapidly because the speed of the memory card allow the camera to write to it faster.Also, I recomend the SquareTrade warrenty...already used it when my wife dropped it and broke the LCD screen!", "Date": "December 26, 2010"}, {"Title": "Repair service is BAD at Panasonic", "Author": "Momo", "ReviewID": "R1GOE8HN10GSGF", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I hate to say, but Panasonic customer service sucks!

I have just returned from a 3 week trip through the Amazon Jungle, Machu Picchu, & Galapagos Islands. During this trip I took over 3400 photos with this camera. The general construction of this camera held up very well in some pretty tough weather conditions. Everything from heat & extreme humidity,high altitude & cold wet weather, & open salt water conditions. The weight of this camera makes it easy to pack & hold. The zoom is incredible & the quality of pictures from average to good. I shot most of the pictures in the program mode & about 400 in IA (auto) Little to no shutter lag & auto focus worked well most of the time. My issues are with the senor & processing. Sometimes this affected the quality of the picture or pictures in the view finder appearing to be in focus, only to get home & preview on a 22\" monitor to find they were out of focus. The other issue for me was the 24X zoom. My experience shows that at the extreme end of this zoom most pictures were out of focus. Likely to due to my inability to hand hold this camera still, even when braced against a firm object. Camera shake can always be a problem. Also the auto focus had difficulty focusing at extreme distances. I found it was best for me not to exceed 21X zoom. I like this camera as a bridge camera & the fact you don't have to pack a lot of glass (lens). However the photos I took with Nikon D40 on this trip were superior to the Panasonic. As the price points drop on this camera it will become a real bargin. The battery life is average, as I was able to shoot about 520 photos on a single charge. Also batteries were difficult to find, as I was forced to purchase (3) after market batteries for the price of 1 panasonic. The reason I gave it 3 stars is due to the focus issues,guessing about battery life, & knowing now that for extreme zoom one should use a tripod. The low light capabilities of this camera are average.The flash is adequate with varied results. Likely there are few cameras that compete with Panasonic in this price range. I was happy to have this camera, as many of the wild life photos were much easier to take with the extend zoom.

If it is worth shooting, these cameras aren't up to the task. The long part of the zoom is not fast enough to get long shots except in the brightest of light with a perfectly stationary object.  The limited ISO means that shooting people indoors without a flash is very hit and miss., With a flash the results are perfect except for the need to clean up the mess the flash makes of peoples faces.Buy yourself an Olympus Pen or a Pana micro 4/3s  ...... not much bigger especially since the Pen's lenses fold in.  My camera bag is no bigger or heavier than with my FZ30 and I only get 300mm with the Pen .... but the image quality is far far far better. Many more images are keepers with no PP.If your time is worth something to you, spend more and get micro 4/3.... The post processing time you save will pay the difference in no time.  If you really don't care enough to do the required PP, buy a much smaller and much less intimidating point and shoot.If you must buy this camera, invest in a Puffer to soften out the flash, it allowed me to get another year out of my FZ30.

Which means that all of the extra buttons and confusing submenus are all wasted.Yes, the mega-zoom on this camera is very nice.  The ability to shoot video is nice, the compact and lightweight footprint is nice.If you are considering this camera, find a site that does real hard-core camera reviews and look at some of the pictures they post as examples of the noise this sensor produces.  I saw some of those photos before I purchased, but with all the positive reviews on Amazon and other consumer sites, I thought maybe I wasn't understanding something so I made the purchase anyway.

I normally buy from Amazon merchants to get a better price, but this time I bought from Amazon - a mistake. A merchant would not be allowed to sell on Amazon's site with that type of delay. Another mistake, Amazon offered a lens kit with it as something people bought when buying this camera. I did and found out it was too small. The off-site merchant replaced it immediately and laughed when I told them why I bought it. The big disappointment was that I got a defective camera. When using flash, all the images had an orange overtone. After numerous on the phone tests, Panasonic support told me to send it back for repair. Instead I decided to return it to Amazon, another mistake. I now see that it will take 30 days to get my money back. What kind of a company demands that the merchants that sell on there site meet all kinds of strict standards and doesn't come close to meeting their own. As far as the FZ 40 goes, it it has none of the intuitive controls that made the DMC 27 such a pleasure to use and I could see no improvement in picture quality from the 14.1 mega pixels.
