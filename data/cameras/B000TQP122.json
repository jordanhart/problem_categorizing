They each received their cameras on their preceding birthdays.  My youngest's birthday was just a week before our departure date.  Immediately after we opened the package we were finding problems.  In order to change the batteries (which must be rechargable and run out quickly) you have to remove two screws--not practical for daily changing.  Then, the previews on the LCD monitor were all \"oversxposed\".  There isn't a way to turn off the flash so there was no way to resolve the issue.  We also had difficulty with the software that came with the product. I contacted the company and they were rude and useless.  I am very dissastisfied.  The camera is going back and I will be purchasing something else before our trip--money I did not plan on spending.", "Date": "December 2, 2007"}, {"Title": "Piece of \"you know what!\" Just awful!!!", "Author": "Susan J", "ReviewID": "R3VHQC81IKNNVH", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "This is the worst piece of technology I've ever encountered. To President and CEO of Crayola LLC, Mark J. Schwab and the rest of your management team, Dona Fisher, VP and CFO and Thomas J. Owens, VP, Operations...do you know how absolutely worthless this camera is?!?!? The creators of this camera deserve to be fired for the trying to pass this off as a camera. My husband is having a hard time installing the software because it just doesn't work, and mind you he is a Senior SystemS Administrator in IT, the sounds of the buttons are obnoxious and the camera takes such poor quality pictures that delete after the camera is shut off. SHAME ON YOU Crayola LLC for trying market such a worthless item to young children. Save your money and DON'T BUY THIS CAMERA!!! I wish I could give this MINUS 5 stars if I could!

I purchased the first one on sale and the other at full price.  I took them out of the packages.  I wanted them to be able to use the cameras right away when they opened them on Christmas this year.  I put the batteries in the camera, which was difficult because the batteries are held in by two very small screws that are hard to remove.  Once I got the camera together, I decided to test it out.  The photo quality was absolutly horrible.  I took a picture of my cat and it looked like a blob with lightes shooting out.  My boyfriend then attempted to take a photo of me at optimal 5ft distance.  You can only recognize the shape of the person, not the person in the photo.  Needless to say, one of the cameras is going right back to the store.  Unfortunately since they were purchased and opened at different times, I only have the packaging for one camera.  I plan on giving my 2 year old the camera we are keeping, so she can get used to taking care of something.  Hopefully it is at least durable.  I wouldn't waste my money on this product if I were you.

It is a big dissapointment.  I was not expecting much since it is a kid's camera, but it was so much further from even my loswet expectations.  Firts of all the prewview screen had a sticker over it and it took a lot of work peeling it off.  Then every picture taken was unviewable.  I was not sure what they were of and I took half of them myslef.  It also ate battieries like crazy.  My kids enjoyed it for about an hour before they wre total junk and unusable.  I didn't even get to the point of hooking them up to the computer, i packed them up and took them back to the store the next day.  I am pretty dissapointed in all the kids cameras that are out there today - is even 2.0 megapixles too much to ask for?  Or something that lets them take a decent picture and enjoy the experience.  Anyway - don't waste your time and money on this camera.", "Date": "February 17, 2008"}, {"Title": "The worst camera ever!!!!", "Author": "P. E. C.

The problem with picture quality is greatly exaggerated.  Yes the photos have a hot spot when the flash is used, so the trick is simple.  Put a piece of tape over half the flash.  It fixes the problem.  That is why I give this camera 3 stars.  Because you do have to modify it with tape since there is no flash setting.The included software is a bit slow in editing the pictures, but my 2 year old is still too young to use a PC.  My plan is to let her use the camera until it breaks and then get her a new one.  But the picture quality is descent for $30.She loves the camera and loves taking pictures, I don't think picture quality maters that much to her anyways.", "Date": "October 26, 2009"}, {"Title": "pictures look like they're drawn by crayon", "Author": "J.

Moses \"MaryMo\"", "ReviewID": "R2OKBH6QWA7GWA", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "My daughter received this for her birthday today.  She was so excited, so we opened it right away and put batteries in it for her.  First of all, once the camera is on, you have to hold the button down for several seconds before it will actually take a picture, so most of the pics that she took were of headless people or the floor.  Then, if you press the delete button (it's green with an X on it) twice, then it will erase the pictures.  Of course she doesn't remember that she's not supposed to press THAT button.  There are only five buttons on the camera, so of course any kid is going to be pressing all of the buttons trying to figure out what they do.  So, now my daughter is in bed and I'm cleaning up and notice that the LCD screen is still on.  I push the power button and it won't turn off.  Also, the pictures that are on the camera cannot be downloaded (I tried).  I haven't experienced if it erases the pics when the camera is turned off, because it won't turn off.  This will be returned to the store tomorrow.  What a waste of money!
