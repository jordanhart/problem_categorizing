My kit came to the house on time and everything in the kit were all there.  They did not miss a thing.  The Nikon D3200 from CAMETA CAMERA performed beautifully. I was impressed with the quality of the tripod. It was not cheaply made nor was it flimsy. The 70 - 300mm lens that came with the kit is amazing. I strongly recommend buying this product from CAMETA CAMERA!!", "Date": "March 23, 2013"}, {"Title": "Love it !!!", "Author": "CS", "ReviewID": "R292SCM65DN2EL", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Chose this package because of all the \"extras\" included.
