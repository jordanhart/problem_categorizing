So, I chose carefully and have not been disappointed.  Best shooting so far has been at the Tidal Basin last Friday just past the peak of the cherry blossoms.  The camera took some amazing shots of the Washington and Jefferson monuments surrounded by the pink splendor.  I displayed the shots on my big screen TV to the whole family without any problems.  Color was perfect and the automation in this camera really frames the shots well.  I'm a so, so photographer so this is a big plus.Next I tried it out at the Dolphin show up at the National Acquarium in Baltimore.  The results were excellent, especially the zoom.  I caught the dolphins in the midst of almost every trick including the huge leap to the top of the auditorium to touch the ball.  I also took some incredible photos through the glass of the seahorses.  The exposure took some tweaking but I was able to figure it out with less than 10 shots.  The family oohed and ahhed when they saw them.For those of you who own Minolta and have grown used to the interface and quality of features, this is a no-brainer.  For the price, I expected a bit less and have been consistently amazed by the quality of pictures it takes, especially in automatic mode.  My SLR has been sent to the cabinet until I really need it for more complicated shots.Be sure to have at least 2 sets of batteries and keep them in your bag.  Each trip I exhausted the batteries and had to change them.  Also, for the $$$, I recommend a 256MB card so you can take 100+ high quality images.  That's what 4.0MP is all about.", "Date": "April 11, 2002"}, {"Title": "Great camera", "Author": "J. Bianco", "ReviewID": "R1QT5XZMJEE2F5", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I am completely sold on this Minolta.  It takes fantastic photos, is simple to use and a pleasure to work with.  I have been taking photos seriously for over 15 years and have owned over 30 camera, from Canon 35mm to large format cameras.  I have not been impressed with digital cameras, though I have used them, until now.  This camera delivers crisp, clean images, comperable to a 35mm film camera, and features all the benefits of a digital camera.  If you are thinking of a new camera give this one a shot.  You can preview your shots, delete them, tweak them on your home PC, it offers it all.  I have compared this camera to the Canon G2 (at almost 2x the price) and remain impressed with the Minolta.  A few shortcomings - battery drain and a hard-to-see backpanel (in FULL daylight that is - otherwise it is fine) moderate my review from raving to complely impressed.  Definately buy the rechargable batteries, Monster, the company that makes Monster Cable, makes some which are very good.  I have seen people in these reviews complain that the digital cameras are not 'up to film' in the images they create, but that is a bit of a non-sequitar to me, if you want a film camera, get one.  If you want a digital camera you cant do better than this one - literally - for the price.Enjoy it...", "Date": "May 7, 2002"}, {"Title": "Excellent Camera for what I want to do...", "Author": "M. Loomis \"mloomisgeo\"", "ReviewID": "R2KTQU97RJOAAM", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "First of all know what you want from your camera...  I wanted to be able to print at least 4x6 prints of every picture I took with this camera.  That put me in the 4 mega pixel range.  I was looking at the Canon G2, Canon S40, Olympus D60, and the Olympus C4040.  I'd gone to the local retailers and tested them all out. Then the Minolta S404 came out and hit my personal price sweet spot -> [price].  All the other ones I was holding off on because I knew I would need to spend more money on extra memory and probably an extra battery pack.  That put the others out of my price range.I'm at best an amatuer photographer and this camera turns out to be a very good match for my skills.  Most of the time I use the all auto feature, but I've many of the more sophisticated features including macro (real good close ups of plants and small animals), night shot, and portrait.  I've worked with some of the more manual features such as black & white and the exposure settings.  The camera is extremely easy to use including the menus one uses on the LCD.  I'm a computer programmer, so using some of the features is almost second nature.The photos have come out absolutely wonderful both on the computer screen and in print.  I've had 4x6 and 5x7's made.  There's an 8x10 on the way in the mail.  I've taken this camera to a school field day, a company picnic, Baltimore (Inner Harbor and Aquarium), and Mount Vernon, Virginia.  I've also taken it on tour of the neighborhood, where I used the macro function exclusively.  I've kept the image settings mainly on 2272X1704 pixels (size)-fine (picture quality) and 1600x1200 pixels - super fine . From time to time I'll use 2272x1704 - super fine.Using the biggest picture and the highest quality settings produces an 11 MB file.  The image capture is excellent, but it takes 15-20 seconds to save the image to the compact flash.  I thought I'd broken the camera the first time I took one of these large pictures.  I don't consider this a draw back, just something to keep in mind.The look and feel of the camera -- it's all there.  It comes in a silver metal case and definitely does not feel like a light weight piece of trash.  The brightness of the LCD can be changed by the user.  All the way from off to super bright.  When using the camera in bright sunlight don't expect to see the LCD too well.  That goes for any machine with an LCD.Batteries... This camera eats the alkaline batteries it comes with. They last long enough for you to test it out and decide whether or not this camera meets your needs.  Buy at least 8 rechargeable AA batteries (the camera takes 4, so you'll have two sets).  Get the highest rating possible - I have 1600, but I've seen 1800 too.When I bought the camera, I also bought a 128 MB compact flash card.  If you take pictures like I do, you'll need it.  I also bought a compact flash reader.  I've found it easier to use than the camera when downloading pictures to my computer.  Not to mention, it saves the camera batteries.", "Date": "June 1, 2002"}, {"Title": "Good for the price, but...", "Author": "Doug Lester", "ReviewID": "R2SJSBNEP41EMF", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I've just been playing with the camera for a few days and, with reservations, I am really impressed.  This is a very easy camera to learn how to use.  Even in full auto mode there are still options available, such as flash mode, drive mode and exposure compensation.  Auto mode also give the macro, portrait, night portrain, and landscape programs.  The picture quality is quite good too in auto.  The only option at the auto setting is the standard (default) setting.  That still gives very good 5x7's and this is the next to lowest quality setting.  With a 127M card at 2272 x 1704 pic setting the camera will hold about 100 shots.What I don't care for is that there are only 2 aperature settings each at telephoto and normal/wide angle.  This limits the control over the depth of field in manuel setting.  Speaking of manuel settings, don't get the idea that once you bypass the auto setting that you are going to grab focus or zoom rings to manually adjust the settings.  Everything is still operated through the control button on the back.  This makes adjusting the zoom and the focus a little hit and miss.  You'll just have to get the hang of how to play with the button.  The autofocus is a little slow if the camera is set to focus only when the shutter button is pushed down.  If you are needing to keep up with a lot of action, set the autofocus on full time or turn it off and prefocus manually.I know that the above paragraph sounds a little negative, but all I'm trying to say that if you are expecting a near professional quality camera, it's not going to come at this price.  In all this is a good quality point-and-shoot camera with a lot of options that you can get creative with, and even with the restricted aperature settings, I think that I'm going to get a lot of good use out of it.", "Date": "April 20, 2002"}, {"Title": "This is the camera for me.", "Author": "Mae Muehl", "ReviewID": "R1Z7SGRCOF3O4S", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I've used this camera for two months now and I'm really pleased. I researched digital cameras for about a month (reading reviews on the internet, visiting local camera shops and talking to people who own digital cameras) before I made my final decision. I wanted a camera that was easy to use, took nice enough pictures to print for framing and/or photo albums, and wanted to stay within a budget of $500.00The S404 was the only camera in my price range that was 4 megapixels and a 4X optical zoom. I did compare it with the Sony DC75 and the Olympus 3020 and I think you can see a difference between the 3 megapixel and 4 megapixel when you have pictures side by side. The Sony and the Olympus did have more in manual controls, but only a 3X optical zoom and the Olympus didn't have sound with it's video. Another nice feature on the S404 is the voice memo you can attach to the picture. This, plus the fact that subject program buttons (Macro, Portrait, Landscape and Night), the flash/red eye and zoom are exactly like my 35mm point & shoot camera, a Minolta Freedom Zoom 140EX. This was an added bonus for me, I felt like I already knew the S404. ...Now the fun began. I wanted to try every feature on the camera. Outdoor pictures were great, however in bright sunlight I do adjust the white balance to \"daylight\". The Macro is fantastic, you can see every detail (very close to my SRL shots), the Portrait mode is a really nice feature and gives your pictures a professional look. I used this for my daughter's high school graduation pictures. After reading some people were having problems with indoor pictures, I tried the different ways and found the best pictures were when I was using \"auto\", they look great to me. I haven't had the opportunity to use the Night Portrait yet, but I know it works beautifully on my point and shoot and I'm hoping for the same with the S404. I did view some photos other people took of fireworks on the 4th and they look great!I take all my photos in the 2274 x 1704 imagine size and the fine quality mode. I started using superfine, however I really didn't see much of a difference, and fine uses a lot less space. I do download my pictures using the Dimage Image Viewer Utility, save them, and then I can open them in any other program. I just started using the print index feature and having 4 X 6 prints made at the local camera shop. (I found this is where the flash card that came with the camera comes in handy, I can drop this one off and I still have one in my camera). WOW!!! YOU CAN'T TELL THE DIFFERENCE FROM PRINT FILM!!! Although I have been getting beautiful print outs with my HP 930C, I have been using a lot of ink and photographic paper. From now on, pictures I want for the photo album I will have printed at the camera shop. The paper is a little heavier, it's probably cheaper and saves time.This camera is easy to use, fits your hand nicely, and takes beautiful pictures. I met all my objectives with this camera. If you can find one, I highly recommend it!ProblemsAs mentioned in other reviews, the auto focus sometimes misses. However the more I'm using the camera, the less this is happening. I really dislike the lens cap, I wish Minolta could have figured an internal lense cover which would close when the camera is turned off.", "Date": "August 8, 2002"}, {"Title": "With Apple's Mac OS X", "Author": "\"jsgardner\"", "ReviewID": "R2QMABN6VR7L35", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This camera is great.

I've used and owned many cameras in the past 30 years and this is easily one of the best values in a 4MP camera today.Picture quality is excellent, the reason why I wanted a 4MP camera.  The lens exhibits measurable distortion but in the type of use that this camera is most likely to see, it's negligible.  Under bright daylight, colors are well saturated and contrast is very good.  In moderate room light, color saturation is still good but contrast starts to fall if the built in flash isn't used.  The most difficult lighting situation I encountered was in a large underground cavern with low level artificial lighting.  With some post-processing I was able to extract usable images, very impressive!  The S404 produces pictures equal to, or better than any other 4MP camera and better than any camera in its price range.The camera is shaped a little differently from other cameras, being short and squat instead of tall and thin.  I find this makes it very easy to hold as I can use most of my hand to comfortably grip the camera rather than just my fingertips.  The controls are well placed and can be used without looking.  Auto mode works well for most situations but there is manual mode too.  Manual mode isn't truely manual though.  In this mode you can set various operating parameters, such as metering mode, focus mode, exposure mode (including limited manual control), etc., that are preset and unadjustable in auto mode.  It's really a custom mode that can be easily accessed through the main control, a useful feature in some cases.This camera feels solid.  Most of the body is satin finished aluminum, the various doors and covers are plastic or silicone.  Although it isn't a heavy camera, its small size (in relation to its weight) makes it feel substantial.  Everything is nicely finished although there are very slight color differences between the different materials.  This is a good looking camera.Yes, it eats alkaline batteries like candy.  I bought two sets of 1700 mAh NiMH rechargeables and a 256MB CF card at the same time as the camera and with conservative use of the LCD, I can take 127 photos at 2272 x 1704 pixels on a single set of batteries.It's best if images are processed with the Minolta DiMage Image Viewer Utility.  I view my images on a 21\" monitor and remapping the colorspace makes a huge difference to saturation and shadow detail.  There's also another advantage if you archive your photos.  The Minoltaspace photos have exposure information (white balance, shutter speed, aperture, date, etc.) embedded in the file.  Resaving the file with a photo editing program loses this valuable information.  The original 36-bit image can be archived on CD, preserving significantly more information than the 24-bit image produced by most editing programs.Great pictures, good ergonomics, a decent feature set, and excellent construction.

Overall, I am pleased with it's performance, but in retrospect I think I would have been happier with the Canon Powershot G2 or G3. In ideal lighting situations, the camera performs very well and produces very good images. Battery life has been good, and Compact Flash is by far the best storage format.  However, in less-than-ideal conditions, I believe there are better cameras on the market.There two areas in which this camera has disappointed me are:1. Flash photography- The stated range of the flash unit on this camera is a bit shorter than others (~10 ft.), and in real-world conditions subjects appear very dimly lit in the upper end of that range. Other cameras in the same price/resolution category have flash ranges closer to 15 ft.2. Time between shots- The camera is rated at 5-seconds between shots in normal shooting mode. The Canon Powershot, for example, can take back-to-back shots in 2 seconds. This has been a problem for me when trying to capture movement and action shots.That being said, this camera is significantly less expensive than the Canon Powershot G2/G3.Hope this helps.", "Date": "March 2, 2003"}, {"Title": "Love my new Minolta digital camera", "Author": null, "ReviewID": "R27ZMO8KAQU0VW", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I purchased a Minolta Dimage S404 about a month ago after spending nearly a month doing research on digital cameras. I have taken pictures for years with a Canon AE1 but wanted to get into digital photography. I have not been disappointed. Though I admit the first couple of times I took pictures at my son's high school football games, I shot with both cameras to make sure I had pictures.The Minolta has a fast enough shutter speed to catch the action during daylight football games. The flash is not good enough for action after dark, but I knew that would be the case.I bought a 128 card and a card reader which both work great. One of the reasons I bought the Minolta was because it uses AA batteries. Yes, it eats the regular ones, but I've had very good luck with the two sets of rechargables that I bought. At least you can always find AA batteries if you're in a bind.Since I have a Macintosh computer at home, I was a little concerned about how the camera would work with it, but I've had no problems. The photo software I already had on my computer works great and the prints are wonderful.I've also taken the card from the camera and used it in the Picture Maker at a local store just to see how that works or if I'm short on time and it makes wonderful prints.This is a camera I highly recommend.", "Date": "December 6, 2002"}, {"Title": "Excellent Camera, Good Price, Nice Pictures", "Author": "Christopher", "ReviewID": "R2KDUD59L2YQ65", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I have owned this camera now for about two weeks and have taken about two hundred photos with it.

I took the cameras to Yerba Buena Gardens in San Francisco and shot a few images of the flowers, buildings and waterfalls.  The Minolta handled itself well giving just slightly more detail than the Nikon (3.34 megs) and noticeably more than the Canon (2.1 megs). But that's what I expected for a 4 meg camera.  In terms of speed, it really shined, with a boot up speed about half again faster than the Nikon and about equal to the Canon.  It processed 2 meg images slightly faster than the Canon's typical <1 meg files and nearly twice as fast as the Nikon's 1.2 meg files.  It's color were good comparted to the Nikon except it couldn't reproduce the blues of periwinkles or the reds of geraniums very well.  The Nikon held the blue of the periwinkles but also rendered the geraniums orange-red.  The Canon handled both colors much better, but had some problems with purples.  As for the Minolta's flash, it seemed to be a little bright, giving better renditions at 1/3 stop under.  I found the Minolta quite easy to use, since I haven't even opened the manual at the time of this writing.  I only have a couple of complaints, one is the macro, which is more close up than macro.  It also doesn't allow focus past a certain range, so if you forget to take it off, your images of landscapes etc will be blurred.  The other minor issue is that the lens didn't retract when I the camera off while it was processing an image.  That said, it didn't have any difficulty turning back on after re-powering up, so it is more of a curiosity than a serious problem....", "Date": "March 18, 2002"}, {"Title": "Super Camera!!", "Author": null, "ReviewID": "R1ZCQIOMPVVGC7", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "We wanted to upgrade from our 1 MP camera and have been looking at the Minolta Dimage series for several months.

If you're wondering how close that is, I can get a full frame shot of my kids from about 30 feet away. I would like to have even more zoom but this is about the best I found without spending a small fortune. One of the best things about this camera over my previous one is that I can take about 10 pictures before I have to wait on the camera. The pictures can be taken about 1.5 seconds apart as long as you aren't using flash.I do have some problems getting pictures in focus which has been mentioned in various reviews around the net.  I think if you really need a shot it would be best to take several shots and also look in to the exposure bracketing feature on the camera.  Also the flash is really strong.  If you are close to the subject, I recommend backing off a little and using the zoom.I have taken some of these digital prints and gotten them printed at the photo developer. I have just gotten 4X6 prints so far but they come out indistinguishable from film as far as I'm concerned. I recommend this method over trying to print them yourself as it is cheaper and much less hassle. I do think my prints come out a touch blue so I need to figure out how to properly color correct them.I have a 64Mb compact flash card and can take about 50 pictures at the full 2272x1704 resolution with Standard compression.

I have looked at all kinds of batteries, but reccommended by Minolta are their re-chargeable \"gold\" batteries that their professional cameras come with. I believe these are the best batteries I have ever used. These are probably the most versatile batteries I have ever used. Alkalines don't last 1/2 as long!! They are 1800 MaH \"platinum\" batteries. Most nickel metal hydride batteries lose their charge after a few hours out of their chargers. I have used these Quest batteries and they hold a charge for at least 2 days.

You can use it right out of the box as a point and shoot with the automatic setting and most of the picture come out excellent. The best thing though is that the camera also allows the a wide range of manual settings. As I learned more and more about photography the camera grew with me and allowed me to tweak my pictures more and more. For me, that's where the camera is the strongest: It can take quick and easy automatic shots when you want them, but it is very flexible and customizable when you are trying to take more professional or tricky shots. The battery life is decent. I use two sets of rechargable batteries, and if I bring both sets, I've never needed more. And I take a lot of pictures on an outting. If you use the highest quality setting, the save time can get a bit long, as it creates large 5 or more megabyte .tiff files, but if you're worried about that, you can step down a quality setting to jpegs, which are still excellent quality.

Images are very good (as long as I take the picture at the right time, as I said I am not such a great photographer... beautiful picutres of people with their eyes closed or looking away... In any case...  its snappy (no real awful delays) its not too expensive, its easy to use, does mini-movies w/sound and just works.  Not too small, has a nice grip.  Doesn't weigh too much (I caried it around Renisiance Festival all day no trouble).  I know it has a lot more features but I don't use them (I will tweak digitally on the computer a bit but not on the camera).  Preview is a great but that is true of all good digicams.  Resolution is great, color is great, and in general contrast is very good (a bit dark but I keep messing with the flash settings and I can fix it on the PC), when I leave it alone it seems to be much better).The zoom is easy to use but it can REALLY zoom (both optical and digital) so be careful.  The multi-shot is great, the flash seem good and seems to reduce red-eye.Things to think about:1. Get a large CFRam card (I have a 128) and get a few hundred shots.2. My CFRAM card is a little slow (check the speed when you buy).3. Get good rechargable AA batteries (2 or 3 sets).  Spend a few more bucks on good ones, you won't regret it (and make sure to get a car charger for trips).4. In \"automatic\" mode make sure you focus on what you want your picture focused on (its very easy but I miss the target once in a while and focus is out).5. Watch the zoom (optical is great) but you can't see for sure through viewfinder with digital zoom (of course) so keep it in mind you need to look at LCD display when digital zooming.6.

For about 3 years I have been using a Canon A5 (0.8 Mpix, fixed lens) with Adobe PhotoDeluxe. So the S404 was a big step up for me.I just got the camera 3 days ago. Most of my playing has been test pictures to get used to the camera and see how it reacts under various conditions.  (I've had it 7 months now and I find that it is an excellent camera).I am using Powerx 1800 batteries and they seem to work fine. With probably 30 min of \"on\" time the battery indicator bar is still solid.  (Battery life is indeed excellent - I take about 30 - 70 pictures a week and recharge the batteries about every 3 weeks whether they need it or not)The camera recognized the 256 Mb Viking CompactFlash card as soon as I inserted it. It shows a capacity of 123 images at highest resolution.Uploads to Windows XP are very easy - Just plug the camera into a USB port, turn it on, wait about 5 sec for the computer to recognize it as an external drive, then drag and drop. Transfer rate is good. 14 hi res images took less than 2 min. The Image Viewer Utility to convert color space is an extra step, but it is pretty easy, can be done in the batch mode, and doesn't take very long. I haven't tried it yet, but I suspect that in a pinch you could probably get the same color results with any good image editor.  (Indeed, you can)The camera is easy to use. My only two complaints are things I knew about up front. The camera is a little bulkier than I wanted (but still less than most of its competition). Second, I have had a couple of pictures where the autofocus missed the mark, but I think this just means I have to be a little more careful to get a good green light before shooting.  (The auto focus works fine as long as you are sure you have a solid green light).All in all, this is a great camera, made even greater by the copy of Adobe Photoshop Elements which I bought at the same time. I doubt if you can truly appreciate the value of a hi res digital camera without a first class image editor to go with it. Photoshop Elements sure fits the bill.

I have the following feedback for those of you just buying the camera.1. Must have 2 sets of NiMH rechargable batteries. Standard alkaline just won't last.2. Indoor shots are best with flash. Outdoor daytime shots are downright beautiful. Night time shots are the most difficult...3. Additional accesories seem almost non-existent. I found a step-up ring adapter (also on Amazon) from the odd 35.5mm size on this camera to a more standard 43mm, from which I can buy other standard size step-up rings (52mm, etc)4. Autofocus and the general auto settings are fine for most shots (I'm no pro - just love digital photography). Just getting into manual mode.5. The video mode is fun but quite limited in both time (60 seconds max) and resolution (320x240) and at 15fps the resulting image is grainy and choppy. This seems more of a novelty then any practical value as a feature. File size is huge (~20MB).6. Buy one or two large Compact Flash cards...are selling 256MB cards for < 50 cents per mb. Plenty of room for high-resolution pictures.7. Don't bother with the digital zoom. As on most digital cameras this feature can be emulated by software and the image quality really drops when this feature is used. Consider a telephoto lens to preserve the quality this camera provides for long-distance close-up needs.All in all this has been a wonderful camera. No glitches at all, highly recommended. I would give it 5 stars but for a few issues. Accessories - hard to find, night-time shots (probably operator error), one call to service to ask about accessories resulted in no help (how can a company like Minolta afford to miss reselling to an existing customer?).Buy with confidence - you will love this camera.

I was looking at the Canon G2, Canon S40, Olympus D60, and the Olympus C4040.  I'd gone to the local retailers and tested them all out. Then the Minolta S404 came out and hit my personal price sweet spot ...  All the other ones I was holding off on because I knew I would need to spend more money on extra memory and probably an extra battery pack.  That put the others out of my price range.I'm at best an amatuer photographer and this camera turns out to be a very good match for my skills.  Most of the time I use the all auto feature, but I've many of the more sophisticated features including macro (real good close ups of plants and small animals), night shot, and portrait.  I've worked with some of the more manual features such as black & white and the exposure settings.  The camera is extremely easy to use including the menus one uses on the LCD.  I'm a computer programmer, so using some of the features is almost second nature.The photos have come out absolutely wonderful both on the computer screen and in print.  I've had 4x6 and 5x7's made.  There's an 8x10 on the way in the mail.  I've taken this camera to a school field day, a company picnic, Baltimore (Inner Harbor and Aquarium), and Mount Vernon, Virginia.  I've also taken it on tour of the neighborhood, where I used the macro function exclusively.  I've kept the image settings mainly on 2272X1704 pixels (size)-fine (picture quality) and 1600x1200 pixels - super fine . From time to time I'll use 2272x1704 - super fine.Using the biggest picture and the highest quality settings produces an 11 MB file.  The image capture is excellent, but it takes 15-20 seconds to save the image to the compact flash.  I thought I'd broken the camera the first time I took one of these large pictures.  I don't consider this a draw back, just something to keep in mind.The look and feel of the camera -- it's all there.  It comes in a silver metal case and definitely does not feel ... light weight ...  The brightness of the LCD can be changed by the user.  All the way from off to super bright.  When using the camera in bright sunlight don't expect to see the LCD too well.  That goes for any machine with an LCD.Batteries... This camera eats the alkaline batteries it comes with. They last long enough for you to test it out and decide whether or not this camera meets your needs.  Buy at least 8 rechargeable AA batteries (the camera takes 4, so you'll have two sets).  Get the highest rating possible - I have 1600, but I've seen 1800 too.When I bought the camera, I also bought a 128 MB compact flash card.  If you take pictures like I do, you'll need it.

Camera is small like a 35mm point and shoot. However it is on the heavy side (not a bulky feel).  Camera is well balanced.  I particually like the glass lense and the photoelectronics it has taken from the more expensive Minolta Dimage digital line.  This camera works in automatic mode and manual mode.  I like to ability to use the manual mode to control both the shutter speed and aperture.  I think you can change the ISO from 100, 200 and 400 but have not gotten that far with the camera other than automatic mode. After taking a picture you are able to look the histogram which displays plenty of info- shutter speed, aperture, ISO, luminance and so on. The camera can also take 60 seconds of movie mode.  I guess this is some sort of MPEG movie or something (again I have not got there yet).  With all these features and the price...I had to buy it. Where can you fnd a 4 megapixel for under $[money] with all these features and from a camera maker.  I would not buy any camera from a company who does not make cameras.  What you get:  camera, strap, USB connection, RCA cables to plug into your TV, 4AA batteries (buy NiMH) and a 16meg CF card.  I think a 16meg card is pretty cheesy but it is made by Luxar and is a 8x card.  I guess this is ok but I went to Fry's and bought a 128meg card for under $40 and it works fine (some no name card made in China).  You also get a couple of CDs for your computer and a manual.

I would do this if the camera ever worked but it shuts off when changing the selector dial...have to remove the batteries to get it to come back on.

Target had it for .... After numerous trips to other stores looking for something better and reading these helpful comments I decided the s404 was for me.  I just got back from Target where they no longer had it on display but when I asked for it they still had it and it came up at $.... I bought it quick without asking a lot of questions.  Much cheaper than anywhere online (other than ebay).  So thanks to all, I have not used it yet but by the way these reviews sound I think I will not be disappointed.", "Date": "December 18, 2002"}, {"Title": "Nice - But Not nice enough", "Author": "Stefan Poulos", "ReviewID": "R3ECKS0O0ZK90W", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "This is (was) my second digital camera. After much research for an upcoming trip I decided on the Minolta. Long story short... I took it back 3 days later. Here's why: Battery Drainer! Even with 1800 Mah NiMH batteries, it does not last long. Although it has nice features and takes nice photos, it isn't worth much to me if you have to carry around a boat-load of batteries...especially on a vacation. Another thing to remember, 2,272 x 1,704 pixel images is large, but will never be as large as 35mm film.  I am getting a very nice compact film camera, having the film scanned to CD, and calling it a digital camera for a fourth of the price.", "Date": "April 29, 2002"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": null, "Features": null, "Name": null, "ImgURL": null, "ProductID": "B00005Y1S2"}}
