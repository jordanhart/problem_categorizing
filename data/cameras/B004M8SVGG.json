{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Returned the LX5 & S95...kept the P300", "Author": "Patswamp", "ReviewID": "R3TE0PNEOJC4NR", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Over the last couple of weeks I've bought all three, returned the Canonand Panasonic. Here's my opinion (again this is mostly opinion, notfact):- P300 and S95 are almost the exact same size, LX5 was too big (i.e., toothick for a pocket)- P300 and LX5 both have direct video record buttons- LX5 and S95 both shoot RAW (wasn't a factor for me, but may be foryou)- All three have great picture quality (1. P300, 2. S95, 3. LX5)- Two have great video quality, S95 is just OK (1. LX5, 2. P300, 3. S95)Because I have an SLR for high-quality pictures, I just want a portablep&s; for when I don't feel like carrying an SLR. That factor hurt theLX5, which I thought was the best camera, just not pocketable.The LX5 had great video, really fast focusing (for pics and vid), andstrong build quality. It's JPEGs were the worst of the three, but thirdbest in this class is generally better than 1st place in a lesser classof cameras. It felt solid. I liked the direct video record button. Idisliked the lens cap.The S95 never did much for me, it's pics were good but not better thanthe P300. It's video was definetly the worst of the three, but again,solid for a point and shoot. The ring around the lens was cute, but feltloose to me. The lack of a direct video record button was limiting and Ifound the auto pop-up flash annoying (it pushes your finger out of theway, both other cameras have mechanical flash pop-ups).The P300 is great. Love the picture quality and video quality. Warning,the video is jumpy on pans, this camera won't take the place of an HDvideo camera, but it's great for a point and shoot. The direct videobutton is great too. The lcd screen is beautiful. The camera turns onand snaps very quickly. Shot to shot is excellent too. Picture qualityis great (again, I'm a JPEG user, if you're all aboutRAW-post-processing-for-point-and-shoot-quality-pics you may have adifferent experience).You can slice this opinion a million different ways, all three areawesome cameras. Pick what the most important factor or two is for youand decide based on that. For me, the discriminators were size and videoquality (as they all took great pictures).Update 1:After using this camera extensively for a week or two I've come to appreciate it more. Some of my recent findings which may or may not be helpful to you the reader:- Indoor video can take on a soft appearance and the colors can be off under certain lighting conditions in auto mode, however, it appears that manual tweaks in the program/manual modes carry over from photo to video. So you can set the AWB to a better lighting mode in one of the manual modes and simply switch modes as the lighting situation dictates. Outdoor video continues to be outstanding in auto mode.- The creative modes (black and white, soft, etc.) can also be used for video, again you will need to be in a program/manual mode (P, A, S, M). Of these I do find the black and white to make interesting video depending on what you're shooting.- The fast motion and slow motion modes for video are quite fun to use (they may not be all that useful, but they're fun).- The panning motion panorama (easy mode?) combined with the Nikon software if pretty impressive. The stitched assist mode panorama works well too. It's particulary impressive in multiple monitor set ups, I can spread the picture across 3 screens and see an impressive panorama.- Having no \"welcome screen\" is the way to go if you want a quick start up.- The camera does not weigh much, it's a little off-putting at first, but light is good.- I love being able to decide if the flash should be used by flipping the switch because I usually do not want a flash (fill flash is all I use pretty much) and it's apparent by looking at the camera if the flash is on or off, there's no digging into menus to find out.- If you're reviewing your work (via HDMI for instance) on the camera or a tv you can press (and hold) the play button instead of power to avoid opening up the lens.- The battery has provided a long life per charge, I haven't tested it but it may be better than advertised. Two drawbacks: it goes from fully charged to empty without much warning (icon is full, and then it's down a bar for a few minutes, then empty) and you plug the camera in to charge vs putting the battery into a charger (that's a draw back because you can't swap a fresh battery in and charge at the same time, if you buy the separate charger you can do this. I bought both an extra battery and charger to avoid any power outages).- Applying after effects in the camera works well and the camera automatically copies the original.- This is a piece of advice that will be obvious to some (ok, it's really for my mom): set the date and time accurately and don't have the date imprinted on your pictures. This info is part of the \"meta data\" that you can see on any computer. You want an accurate date so you can sort photos later if required and you don't want the date imprinted on the photo because it ruins the picture and is already in the meta data.Update 2:- I have been using this for over 6 months now. It's seen a couple of vacations, kid's events, hiking expeditions, holidays/birthday parties, etc. My satisfaction with this camera has grown over the months not diminished.- The price is a lot better now than when I bought it, it's particularly attractive at under $250.- It's light and compact, I have no problem putting it in pockets or holding on to it with the attached lanyard.- It starts up and fires a good picture wicked fast. This is key for a point and shoot as most of the scenarios you want a camera for don't necessarily involve composition, it's more about capturing moments as they happen, often without warning.- I still am not completely satisfied with the video, this is where Nikon can definitely improve the camera for the next iteration. It's good video, just not as good as the LX5 and nowhere near as good as a stand-alone HD camcorder (a future dinosaur?). The video is about on par with the iphone 4s, perhaps a tad better.- Speaking of the iphone 4s, I was worried/hopeful it would make the Nikon P300 obsolete in my house. It didn't. The P300 just takes way better pictures. Full sunlight with no tricky shadows and no popping colors--they're probably equal. All other shooting scenarios especially low-light--P300 is a lot better.- I still hardly ever need the flash, it excels in low-light.- I was intrigued by the new Canon S100, I haven't used it yet so I can't give you a comparison, however, preliminary reviews make it look like an incremental update to the S95. With the switch from CCD to CMOS it actually seems closer to the P300 than the S95 was. It still has the silly ring and auto pop up flash that I didn't care for from the S95. I'm not a Canon hater by the way, I love their products and own several.- One regret: I never actually needed a second battery. I probably shouldn't have bought it. It has sufficient battery life for most people.", "Date": "March 29, 2011"}, {"Title": "Excellent low-light pictures and HD video!", "Author": "robbieY \"robbieY\"", "ReviewID": "R84M4XZPJJ3I1", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Note: this review is for the layman--who wants to eventually learn to use manual features--but ends up using only auto-mod, so all you pros please don't make too much fun of me.I'm a father of a 2-year-old and I take lots of indoor shots and tons of video clips. My almost 3-year-old camera was a Canon SD790IS: 10 MP, 640p video (Yes, very low resolution but it never lost focus!), mono microphone.Question: Is it too much to ask for a camera with great low-light abilities, Full HD video, a stereo microphone, and no removable lens cover? Apparently the answer was YES!I bought a Canon SD4000IS but returned it because it couldn't hold a focus in HD video mode. Not even on stationary objects using a tripod! Ridiculous!My online search continued with finding cameras that had good video but too many megapixels (above 12 MP is bad) for a point-and-shoot, which made the pictures worse!I eagerly awaited the reviews for the Canon SX230 but was devastated when I noticed blurring in some posted videos by infosyncworld.I was even ready to shell out the big bucks for the Panasonic LX5 but it has a removable lens cover! Are you kidding me? I don't have time to remove the cover before powering up.So finally, this Nikon P300 comes along and it does everything I wanted! Finally! My 2-year search has ended!The HD video is amazing! The focus stays sharp throughout. I don't think I'll be using the 1080p mode too often (I have a Canon VIXIA camcorder that records 1080p that I use for birthdays), 720p has made me very happy. Even the slow-motion mode can record in HD! Check out YouTube for cool slow-motion videos. A lot of new Canon models recently released can record in slow-motion but only very low quality, less than 640p.Video mode records in 30-minute chunks, that's enough for me. When recording in 720p, the camera's LCD displays a countdown from 30 minutes going down instead of a counter going up. I find this useful, you'll know how much time you have left. I need to read up more on this though, maybe different SD cards can record for longer.Many professional reviewers scoffed that this camera did not have RAW Tiff capabilities. I don't care that it doesn't have RAW tiff. If I want RAW tiff, I'll buy a DSLR in the future.I like how the flash only pops up when you physically pop it up with a switch on the side. So far I don't need it. The flash design is great, it allows you to place your left index finger right behind it when it's raised. I didn't like how some new Canons have a flash that automatically pops up each time you power it up. For shots where you don't want a flash, you'd have to always fold the flash back down. Try imagine telling that a hundred times to friends: \"yeah, turn it on, but push the flash back down, yeah, no, like this...\" Annoying. Also, too many moving parts just seem more cumbersome and more likely to break.Some minor complaints:1. When importing pictures onto my Mac, I have to manually rotate the portrait shots. Canon did this automatically.2. I have to charge the battery in the camera. I can purchase an external charger but that's another $30. Plus I hear the charger has a long cord instead of a flip-out 2-prong design like the Canon chargers.I love the design, the dials are sturdy, the record video button is very helpful. Buy it! you'll love it!", "Date": "April 13, 2011"}, {"Title": "If video as well as stills are important to you", "Author": "sharoninmass \"sharoninmass\"", "ReviewID": "R1XYK3TY7TR3G5", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "\"Should I buy this camera?\" is like asking \"Should I buy this car?\" The answer to both questions is: It depends on what's most important to you. For me, I was looking for a point-and-shoot that takes good HD video as well as good still photos, and is reasonably small, light and affordable. I already have a DSLR, and wanted a camera to complement that -- one I could slip in a pocket and take to the beach or an evening out without having to worry about it.I believe other commenters that there are P&S; cameras out there that take better photos than the P300, but those models are either considerably larger and heavier, a good deal more expensive (one comment here compared a camera costing $500 with this one at slightly over $300), or the video quality is unacceptable. After a lot of research, the P300 turned out to be the camera that best met my needs.I've only had this for a couple of days, but here's what I like so far:* Nice ergonomics. I enjoy holding and using the camera, which isn't something I can say about my previous P&S.;* Large, bright, sharp LCD* A good mix of manual controls for when I want them and auto settings for when I don't.* Macro closeups are excellent* Low-light performance is generally good for a P&S;, especially with the fast 1.8 lens.* I've been pleased so far with my outdoor shots, although I haven't really had a chance to do much with this outside yet because weather's been bad* The flash only fires when you first pop it up, so it doesn't inadvertently ruin a shotWhat I don't like so far:* White balance in mixed indoor lighting seems worse than average* As I read in another review, video can be jerky while panning* Detail in distant objects doesn't look as crisp as in photos I've seen from competitors in its class* (updated) You will hear motor noise when zooming in and out on video (at least I do)* (updated) Focus in auto mode is limited to frame center* (updated) Photos taken in portrait mode don't auto rotateThere are some interesting features such as in-camera HDR and one-shot panoramas I've yet to try. All in all, I'm looking forward to taking this with me when I'm going places where I don't want to take my considerably heavier and bulkier DSLR.UPDATE: After reading the manual, now I know why I've been less than happy with some of my shots in Auto mode: Auto mode focuses on the center of your frame. If you don't always stick your subject dead center -- and most experienced photographers don't much of the time -- don't use Auto mode. If you have a P300 and are unhappy with its focus and metering, try using the program mode or auto scene selector instead, when you want to \"point and shoot\" instead of using the manual controls.UPDATE 2: A few more tests and I'm a bit less happy with the camera. If I could drop this down to 3.5 stars, I would. I really like the ergonomics, the menus, the LCD. Using it is still fun. I've shot a number of comparisons with my old 8 MP Canon SD 850 and the results are mixed. Macros are way better, but that's not what I bought the camera for. I didn't bother comparing video since the P300 HD I'm sure will blow away the SD 850's SD. In other situations it was mixed, with the P300 not always better.Like all point-and-shoots, this is a compromise and there is going to be a sacrifice in return for weight, size and affordability.FINAL UPDATE: I took the P300 out for some serious shooting last weekend, including several hours with my friend and her new Canon S95. We tried shooting several of the same scenes (although P300 zooms out a bit wider and S95 has a bit more of a telephoto, so it often wasn't exact). I was happy with the vast majority of the P300 photos. There were some where the S95 versions were better, especially when it came to detail in the photos. But without comparing, I was pleased with the majority of photos I shot with the P300. The difference didn't seem all that massive except for a couple, and that might have been because I didn't select the best mode.On the other hand, the P300 video was quite a bit better than the S95 video, if that matters to you. It does to me. I shot a video at an indoor party last night and was very happy with the way it came out. I didn't hear any motor noise when zooming in and out in what was a pretty loud room.Ergonomics: I enjoyed using (and carrying) the P300 more than the S95. It's slightly lighter. I like the Nikon dials and menu setup more than Canon's -- that's just personal preference, but I've never particularly cared for the menu setup on my old Canon P&S; either. I also found the mode selector dial somewhat hard to turn on the S95 compared with the P300.Bottom line: I'm using this to post photos on the Web and occasionally make 4x6 prints, and also to shoot video from time to time. If I was looking for a primary camera to shoot serious still photos -- that is, if I didn't also have my DSLR -- I'd likely pay more and go with the S95. But as a casual supplement to a DSLR, I recommend the P300.", "Date": "April 5, 2011"}, {"Title": "makes a great carry camera.", "Author": "J. Parkes", "ReviewID": "R1ISWMSOMBUIDA", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I am a Nikon fan and though Cannon has done a better job with it's P&S; cameras, Nikon has finally stepped up it's game.I use a Nikon D90 with an array of great lenses, but the truth is unless i plan a shooting day i'm just tired of having to lug around a DSLR and it's bag of essentials. I will always need the big rig, but on a daily basis the P300 is great, slips in a pocket and is very quick to start and snap pictures. I find it comes with me every day without thought or worry. The only big deal for me is the lack of a circular polarizer filter for outdoor use here in Florida, but i don't think any P&S; will give you that.The low light performance is terrific as is the vibration reduction system, there are a lot of scene modes to play with and full manual control. The auto focus is quirky and i need to pay attention, but is fairly reliable....as for all around performance i'd give it a full five stars if it weren't for the auto focus, the image quality is fine, though outdoors the camera has a tendency for light artifacts if your not careful, but that's so in all the P&S; camera's i've tried.The optics are great, the battery life is good, the flash is rarely needed but works well, Start up is under two seconds. low light performance is terrific, the video feature is fine for an occasional video shooter like me, but will never replace a good quality video camera.In all a great little pocket camera, keep an eye on your focus and you're going to get good results.I expect the next generation of this model to have improvements in its auto focus, but then no camera is perfect, and the skill of the shooter is always going to be in overcoming some shortcoming in every camera.I'm happy i have it, i use it daily, and i don't regret the purchase at all.-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------Update~May 11I have taken thousands of shots now with the p300, and learned quite a bit about the camera's....quirks??....not a bad thing, all cameras have their quirks.The p300 continues to impress me beyond measure with its low light/indoor/night time performance!! In fact i get better results using no flash at all for 90% of my shots!There are those who really must have RAW files, for 95% of us we don't need RAW, and jpegs are just great out of this camera.One of my favorite features of the p300 is the high contrast black and white mode, along with the low lighting performance it has produced fantastic salable images!! Everyone's an artist with this camera!!Indoor work is very good, as good as a dslr if you learn this camera's functions. Bars and restaurants are usually difficult without a flash, but the p300 makes the flash almost obsolete except for certain types of shots.I often find i can do quite well without a full dslr camera, and if your'e in the market for high qaulity, but not size and price, this would make a great camera for you.I have not been outdoors much as the weather is not the best for outings yet. will update when i do.", "Date": "April 27, 2011"}, {"Title": "A really good point and shoot", "Author": "cmike2780", "ReviewID": "R212ALMQRAKSUH", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "needed a point & shoot that had the manual controls of a D-SLR, compact enought to carry around everyday and had a quality lens.

I liked the viewfinder on the P7000 and the hot shoe, but it was slow and still a little too bulky for everyday use. The interface is a lot faster on the P300 and the fast f1.8 lens is awesome for a point and shoot. The LCD is big and bright and the controls are very easy to learn. I like the video button, but I wish it was customizable for white balance or ISO control. This is a really great camera and the images are almost as good as my old Nikon D40. Almost.Indoor low light shots with the f1.8 are clean and sharp. You won't believe it was possible with a point and shoot. I also really like the retro body look.Update No.1:  As an arhitect, I use this for documenting projects in the field. The fast lens is really great for those indoor shots when all the light you have is the built in flash and a flashlight.  The images are clear and sharp and I couldn't have been happier with this purchase.  The pano is a really great way of documenting entire facades.

Their cameras are sturdy and durable. Their lenses are sheer perfection and set the standard for the others. Overall, Nikon stands for quality.So, it is no surprise that the newly released Coolpix P300 follows in that tradition and more than upholds the good name of Nikon.I am going to Europe shortly and my (truly wonderful) D300 is just not adept for airline travel or long, rambling, walks. Although the picture quality is perfection plus, the size and weight of the unit (I do have the battery pack attached) makes it quite a handful and not recommended for sightseeing. In their quest to perform miracles, Nikon managed to take the best qualities of the D300 and reproduce them into the P300.First off, the picture quality is excellent.  Surprised? Not really but it is good to know that in a day and age of \"slapped together\" products, this Nikon camera is still up to par with the rest of the line.  Ease of use?  If you use the AUTO function, you've mastered photography. A pro?  Then it has all the manual verstality that any photographer could need.But it is the weight (or lack of it) that is truly impressive.  Although the camera has a good, solid feel when you hold it, it weighs in at a mere few ounces. Light and slim enough to fit into your pocket.  Although tiny in size (and the P300 is miniscule), the quality of the prints it produces is truly amazing.And the rest?

Markwell \"Andy a700\"", "ReviewID": "R1BB63LUM09SXI", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I ordered my Nikon P300 on Tuesday evening using the free postage option, it was with me by Friday, great service by Amazon.I'd previously owned a Canon S90 which is a superb compact, but only has a 28mm wide angle lens & VGA video. I settled on the Nikon P300 as it has a really fast 1.8 lens at wide angle, an extra wide 24mm lens (these are 35mm equivalent focal lengths), and full 1080P video so great for travels. It doesn't have RAW but then if I want to go to that level I'll use my SLR Camera.My only initial reservation in buying this camera was it has a smaller sensor than the S90 so I was slightly concerned at a possible image quality loss & more noise. I needn't have worried. The picture quality from this compact is amazing and low light capabilities superb. I took some pictures last night to try it out when it was semi dark and the camera produced great results, it can see much more light & detail than my eyes can (& no I don't wear glasses yet!!).There are loads of other features I'm looking forward to trying out, but the 1.8 lens has got to be the real selling point. Another good feature is that if you have a modern TV with CEC control, you can use the TVs remote control to control your photo & video playback from the camera when hooked up via HDMI lead. Clever!!The only thing which is not a brilliant idea is that the battery charges in camera, it's great if you only ever need that one. However, chances are you'll need another when travelling or on holiday (I mean vacation to you readers, I'm English !!). The Nikon chargers are expensive so I've just purchased an alternative brand charger & spare battery off here very reasonably priced.In summary, if you want a superb compact with a fast wide angle lens & full manual controls, forget the Canon S90 or S95, get this & it's cheaper too!....

Here's a practical review that I hope you find helpful if you're in the same situation I am.I own a Nikon D90 DSLR camera.  I started photography as a hobby before my oldest child was born 4 years ago.  I'm by no means a photography expert (that takes YEARS), but I've gotten very familiar with common photography techniques and controlling manual settings, i.e. aperture, ISO, shutter speed, white balance, etc.  My kids are currently 3 and 1.My primary goal in getting this camera was to replace an aging Canon SD500 point and shoot.  I wanted something fast and light that I could take with me on day trips (and possibly traveling) instead of my DSLR, as well as something that wouldn't be too intimidating for my wife to use.  I also considered the Olympus XZ-1 and the Sony HX9V (I know, they're all in different classes).What attracted me to the Olympus was the fact that it has the largest sensor, widest aperture across its entire zoom range, and hot shoe for attachments.  What attracted me to the Sony was the fact that it had the best video and longest zoom range.I settled on the Nikon P300 because it appeared to offer a balance between the other two and it happened to be the cheapest of the bunch (at the time I bought it the price dropped to a REALLY low price so I just pounced on it).What I like===========================For a point a shoot, this camera is pretty fast, i.e. the time to take a pic after you turn it on and the time between shots.  This is crucial with kids.  You can also turn on continuous shooting which does something like 7 or 8 shots per second at full resolution, almost twice as fast as my D90 DSLR!  Great for kids!  Get every facial muscle twitch as they slide down that slide!  Woohoo!Ergonomics are great.  Love the rubber bumper on front.I love that it has a dedicated video button.I thought I would miss having a longer zoom range, but in practice I find that I don't really use it much anyway.  With kids you're usually right there by them.  Unless you're a bad parent, then boo on you.The large aperture is great for getting quick shots in low light.  However, it's not magic.  You can only do so much, even with a wide aperture.  I still get blurry shots every so often, probably need to jack up the ISO.  It appears that the auto settings max out the ISO to 800 (anything higher causes a lot of noise in the image), so to get higher ISO you have to be in one of the manual settings and set it manually.  With kids, you tend to leave it on full auto because, really, you don't have time to fiddle with settings.Photos come out crisp and clear as long as you don't pixel peep (zoom in 100% to look for imperfections).  Color reproduction is amazing, colors really pop without being unnatural and overly saturated.  Metering is usually spot on, meaning it knows how to balance the contrast with different amounts of light in the frame.Love that it has a physical pop up flash so that you can control for a certainty whether the flash fires or not.  Also like that it's a mechanical spring loaded mechanism rather than a motorized flash, one less thing to break.I love the boxy retro look and feel.  Even though it's bigger than my old Canon SD500, it feels lighter.  It fits great in my pockets, regular or cargo.  I can use the same pouch from my Canon if I want, too.Screen is HUGE and BRIGHT and CRISP.  No problems whatsoever seeing it outdoors with sunglasses on (except when turning it sideways if you wear polarized glasses, then you can't see it at all, blah).I like that it takes video in H.264 .mov file format.  It seems to be more universal and can play on more devices without having to convert it or install a special codec.  The Sony takes video in AVCHD format.  The Olympus I didn't even bother to check because after seeing video samples, I didn't really care to even bother.  I love that there's a dedicated exposure lock while taking video, but I wish I could set it before I start recording.  Maybe there's a way, I just need to look it up.What I don't like===========================Yes, it takes 1080p HD video at 30 frames per second with stereo sound, woohoo!  Buzz words galore!  The videos come out crisp, the colors are great, BUT, the image stabilization SUCKS compared to the Sony, and the mics suck up wind noise like Charlie Sheen sucks up blow.  Also if you pan too fast it gets choppy.  Maybe I need a faster SD card, but I'd think that if the SD card had issues keeping up with the camera it would just stop recording altogether rather than skip frames.  Who knows, I'll give it a shot.The autofocus doesn't always work right when recording video.  I have it set to continuous autofocus, but it seems to have a hard time deciding what to focus on.  In fact, even if you leave it pointing at a non-moving subject, you can sometimes see the focus going in and out on its own.  If you're following your kids around and they go close to far to close, and you try to zoom in and out, the focus takes a while to catch up.Also, when you're recording video in a relatively quiet environment and you zoom in or out, you can hear the zoom motor in the video recording.  zzzzzzz.  zzzzzzzzzzzzzz.  zzzzzzz.  That's what it sounds like.The camera can be quirky.  Sometimes it doesn't turn on, or it turns on then off then on.  Once, it locked up on me and I had to take out the battery.  The battery door can be easy to open if you hit the release just right.It does not come with an external battery charger, you have to charge the battery in the camera.  The connector is proprietary, not mini or micro USB.  The battery lasts an OK amount of time, but I'd get a spare and an external charger if you can.  The battery life indicator doesn't give much warning as to when it will die, it goes from full to low then off quickly.Other notes:===========================So the photos aren't as good as a DSLR or probably the Olympus.  The video isn't as good as the Sony.  But for the price, you really can't go wrong with this camera.  It isn't perfect, but I think so far I'm impressed, and it's been a great camera to carry around and follow the kids with.", "Date": "October 4, 2011"}, {"Title": "Awesome.", "Author": "Jules Fitzegibbons", "ReviewID": "R3E5X6BHSVEY9P", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Europe trip 2011.  I had to decide whether or not to bring my Nikon D90, Canon 7D....or buy a little point and shoot that might be easier to carry around.

It was the best decision I could have made.  I'm a photographer by trade, and the images coming from this camera are pretty amazing.  Everyone else I travelled with stopped using their cameras after a while and we just used the P300 because the pics were so much better (Crisper images, better in low light (no flash needed), nice wide angle lens, etc, etc).It also shoots decent video - Not great, but decent.  The video looks great on the little 3\" screen but once I played it through HDMI to my 46\" TV at home, didn't hold up quite as great. Video quality is no where near a Canon 7D or similar, but still for under $300 it's more than I expected.  And again in low light, it still looks great.My favorite thing about this camera is that I almost never had to use the flash - even at night.  It performs on par to a DSLR's low light abilities (yes a bit more grainy, but still quite usable (super fast lens 1.8 I believe).  I can't say enough good things about this camera.  It's the first point and shoot I actually enjoy using.  It's menus are simple, it's easy to use.  Ultra compact - fits in your pocket - not like some of the other leading Point and Shoots.One other great thing about this camera is it sort of lets you choose your exposure in Auto Mode if you trick it.  I've tried this with some other P & S's and it doesn't work well, but this camera will lock exposure when you hold down the shutter button half-way....SO if you want to over exposure your scene a little (to compensate for backlighting for example), you just aim the camera down (or to a darker area) to open up the f-stop and lock the exposure and then boom press the shutter the other halfway down and you've got a little extra light.  At first this was a little weird, but after doing it a couple days, it became second nature.  The camera does have manual shutter and aperture controls (Again awesome feature you don't find on many other P & S's) but this little trick is actually faster once you get the hang of it.  Also - other great feature - Flash will never go off in Auto mode unless you click the button to raise it up.  I especially don't like flash unless for a little fill or something so - for me this was a great little extra bonus.  We got some amazing shots just using the exposure-lock trick in Auto mode with this camera.  I'll try to upload some pics soon.So ANYWAY, everyone that went with me on the trip and the people I've showed our pics to are all raving about this camera now too.  I don't rave about too many products, but this is a great one.Oh one other cool feature that seems kind of gimmicky but I ended up using it all the time was the high contrast black and white filter.  I wanted to upload our pics during the trip and I love B&W; photography for architecture - and the B&W; pre-set on the camera creates really unique looking images, so anyway - not great if you're going to post-process, but if you want instant B&W;'s it's a much better filter than most other Point and Shoots I've used and really fun.", "Date": "August 24, 2011"}, {"Title": "Amazing little camera", "Author": "G.

Choi \"Early Adopter\"", "ReviewID": "R4WZUQGEAI1TC", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "First I just want to say there is no camera that is perfect for everything.  I own a Nikon D7000 DSLR with some serious lenses and love the Depth of Field type shots.  Knowing that why did I pick the Nikon P300 simply because of its price and feature for it.  Its the best bang for the buck.  I could have pick a smaller camera but I really wanted the P/A/S/M capability even though it doesn't have RAW.  If I want RAW then I pick up my D7000 and get the right pics.  The whole point of this camera is the size and for what it offers. The smaller P&S; cameras cant give the same performance.  This camera has a f1.8 vs Canon S100 f2.0.  Panasonic Lumix LX5 is too large and should be compared to the new Mirrorless cameras like the GF, NEX, Olympus PEN etc.Here is why I still picked the P300 over the S100 even with its improvements.1) Price $275 vs $4402) Screen 3\" 921K vs 3\" 461K3) Panoramic shots 180 and 360 degrees4) Built in effects5) 1.8 vs 2.06) 24MM vs 25MM and doesnt have f5.9 like the CanonThe advantages of the S1001) RAW Files2) Control Ring & User define3) Built qualityThe both have1) rubber finger grip in front and back2) CMOS but Canon I think is bigger3) 1080P Video4) P/A/S/M controlIf you buy this keep your expectation real all of these cameras cannot get pictures anywhere near a real DSLR that Blur background factor you cannot achieve the same results.  If you want something better invest $500 into Nikon P7100 or Canon G12 for the compact and control.Again I picked this as a simple camera to carry around with P/A/S/M features and great video.  Low-light is very good but not DSLR quality in any of these cameras.  Noise level in ISO 800 and greater is high again you cannot get the same quality in even the entry level DSLR. I don't like using flash when I don't have to.  AWB is average not DSLR quality.But the price of the Nikon P300 vs all other compact manual cameras is the best and what you get for it is amazing.  If you are traveling and someone steals it, it won't be that bad of a loss vs. S100. That to me is the deciding factor because the end result is the same - photo quality.  But if you want the best picture just use your DSLR and don't complain lugging it around.Again why did I pick this because it was cheap and i wanted the P/A/S/M features for when I travel and cannot bring my Nikon D7000 DSLR around.  Mostly for partying at nights in clubs in NYC where having a DSLR can be a pain to carry around.  My other party camera is the Nikon PJ1100 - girls go gaga over the projector and its fun to project images on people.  It gets their attention and I become the attention.

Nice ergonomics2. Good appearance3. Rich features4. DSLR grade LCD display5. Support 120fps 480p movie6. Competitive price in it's classCons:1. Choppy HD movie in 1080 and 720 mode. DO NOT BE fooled by the advertised 1920x1080 p30. Yes, nominally P300 can record in 1920x1080 p30 format, but the quality of the recorded video is unacceptable. I'm not comparing it with a high-end camcorder, DC can not compete with them for video recording. I'm talking about the comparison with DC from the same class, such as Canon sx230. I bought P300 and borrowed a sx230, so I could shoot the same scene and compare the result side-by-side. When you pan or zoom, P300 produces heavily choppy images, SX230 has similar effects but considerably less. Even without panning or zooming, the AE of P300 produces blinking effect in the recorded video. To avoid this, I have to manually lock and unlock AE during the recording, which is painful. SX230 does not have this AE issue at all.2. With the provided charger, the battery can only be charged with the camera body. That means you can not use the camera while charging a spare battery simultaneously.---Some update:Someone blamed me for using a slow SD card when comparing HD video performance.I don't think this is the reason for the choppy images (It's common for a point-and-shot, more or less). First, the card I used was a Sandisk Extreme Pro SDHC 8GB (45mb/s), I think it's fast enough. More important, I used one *same* card in two cameras when recording the video one by one. Yes, the scenes could not be identical, but practically are the same. Then I downloaded the videos to a dell xps-8300 to compare side-by-side. I tried to eliminate differences other than the camera itself in the comparison, so the performance differences were due to the camera, not the card or other factors.I would like to be clearer for my point. An inferior video performance of P300 was what I observed in my comparisons. My test WAS NOT a lab test, but a real-world test that simulated my daily usage. I tried both in a dim indoor environment and a bright outdoor street view using auto mode, results were similar.

Svendsen", "ReviewID": "R3AW8F10CXBKGL", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I have used this camera about 8 months ~ 2300 pics.Semi Auto Only 'auto scene' with 'auto select' is fully automatic. This is your point and shoot setting. No other dial settings are automatic. You will have to turn on the macro for close ups and set the shutter speed and aperature when the camera tells you it needs you to change something in order to get a good picture. It does this by flashing a red box if the camera cannot focus. At first I wanted fully automatic point and shoot until I tried to focus a Panasonic S3 (which has very good reviews) on a nearby object. The S3 would not lock onto the nearby object but always selected a far away object. After that I considered keeping the P300.Lens/Low Light/Wide angle One of the main reasons to buy this camera. Low light pics inside dont require a flash unless really dark!  Take a shot in an almost dark room and this camera will  see it all without a flash! 'Night scene - tripod' without  a tripod, was not good until I set it for 'night scene'  'hand held'  the results are very good night shots.(Hand held setting turns on anti shake and best shot functions) The resulting night shot lets you read a street sign about 75 feet away using only 3M pixels and street lighting only. I have used the flash a few times out of hundreds of pics. Wide angle lens captures a lot of area, nice!Quality/Cost You pay more but get more. Feels like quality in your hands, body, knobs, dials, buttons are all metal. Solid build not much plastic.The dials make everything fast. This camera is designed to get the aperature and shutter settings out of the menus and onto the dials so you have quick access to them.Features This camera has many useful features. Menus change for dial settings revealing more options. Fireworks setting is no good w/out tripod. smeared firework photos. Auto settings are not as automatic as other brands. Ex. Macro only comes on after turning it on, and only turns off after turning it off. Even if the camera is turned off it stays in macro mode until you turn it off. I like this as you can continue your macro shooting without having to reactivate the macro evertime. But other brands (Canon and others) automatically set the macro just by getting close to a subject.  At first I did not like this but now I like it.Size Not a super compact camera and not a large camera. Fits easily into a mans shirt pocket with room to spare but not a very small camera either. The right size to hold in your hands with well positioned rubber grips. Camera is light weight.Misc  Fast start up and shutter. Beautiful hi res display, Battery charges inside camera. Good if you dont want to remove batteries not so good if  you want to have two batteries for quick changing. (you would have to buy an external charger) Compression may be a little high - sharp photos but could it be sharper? The 'scene' setting with auto select is better than 'auto' mode most of the time. Battery life is 200-300 pics but battery meter goes from full to dead in only 15 minutes. 'Special' USB charge/download cord, it is propietory, Not good as the cord takes more room than a short USB cord. Cord on bottom of camera, so camera rests on its face or back while charging or downloading. Zoom is 4.2X which is all I need. Wide angle and low light is more useful to me than a big zoom. Color saturation could be more, you can add more manually.Panorama Much better than other cameras. You can panorama horizontal AND vertical, cooool. Vertical panoramas are great for city shots of tall buildings, etc. Not enough time for 180 sweep, 120 deg. is most you can do with 180 deg setting.  360 deg sweep is too long for 180 deg. Manual panorama assist is difficult. Though not perfect I use panorama frequently.Summary This camera is for anyone who wants a Quality LOW LIGHT portable FAST camera with WIDE angle and full control. Not for someone who wants  just a point and shoot (although it can be a point and shoot in 'auto  scene' ) I was going to return it for the high cost until I experimented  and discovered it is worth the money. Would have given four and a half  stars because of special cord and not enough time for panorama. Low cost point and shoot cameras feel cheap.

I tested this camera against several others, and while all cameras have trade-offs, this camera suits me.  I tried the G12, SX40, P500, 100HS, S95, D3100, and a few others I already own.Initially, I kept the G12 (the P300 was a late attempted purchase by me) and am very happy with it.  It was $369 from Amazon and is a great all-around machine that should last a long time.  It has controls galore snd can be used by amateurs to pros.  It has a larger than typical P&S; sensor, RAW, good build quality, good lens (if a bit slow at 2.8 - 4.5), viewfinder (rare these days in P&Ss;), good articulating screen, good ergonomics, good macro, and so on.  It's fast enough.  5x telephoto.  Fairly easy to carry but big for a P&S; (as I knew).  The viewfinder is important as I'm used to using one and pics have less blur from camera shake.  Also good for sunny days.  IQ is excellent.So, what about the P300?  I wanted a second, smaller camera that could fit in a pocket.  The S95/S100 is (are) too similar to the G12.  I also wanted a camera with a faster lens for indoor use without flash.  Price was something of an issue and the P300 for $245 with a 1.8 wide angle lens (to 4.9; 4.2x telephoto) seemed worth a try.  The 1.8 usually allows for decent pics without flash.  Other fast lens cameras are about $100 more.  The LCD does not articulate but is very high quality at 921,000 pixels.  The camera is fast for a P&S.;  The sensor is not larger than typical P&S; sensors (such as the one in the G12) but the P300 does very well with its backlit 1/2.3 sensor (vs. 1/1.7 on the G12).  Build quality is not quite up to G12 standards but it is metal and MUCH lighter than the G12.  IQ is very good and colors are excellent.  The flash is easy to turn on and off and is mechanical (one less thing to break) - very nicely done.  There is no viewfinder but the camera is fast enough and has a good enough IS system that I get little blur despite modestly steady hands.  It has no RAW but I don't yet use RAW (and may never use it).The camera does have internal battery charging but not a big issue for me --- one can always spend just a little and get a wall charger if it is an issue (get a third party charger and/or 2nd battery).  Video could, perhaps, be a bit better, but I'm primarily interested in pictures.  For these two reasons, four stars and not five stars.For me, these cameras compliment each other very well.  I'd say I'm an advanced amateur looking to become a better advanced amateur.  Next for me could be a longer zoom P&S; (SX40?) or, perhaps, a DSLR like the D31000 (about $550 with good kit lens).  We shall see.I know the P310 is coming out soon but it has few changes from the P300.  More megapixels (not necessarily good in a compact with a small sensor --- e.g., noise), one more control dial, and, perhaps, better video.  And it will cost more at first, if not for a long time.  It seems to have the same lens, looks the same, and doesn't seem very exciting for P300 owners.  Maybe if the sensor were increased to about 1/1.7 size.  Even then I'd have to read some reviews and be convinced.  I absolutely don't see the need for 16 megapixels.P.S.  Just as many prefer the S95 to the S100, newer is not necessarily better.  The P300 just works and easily pumps out good shots.  The 1.8 lens is a great feature for $245 (maybe soon to get even cheaper).

With easy panorama you can just choose either 180 or 360 degrees and pan the camera.  With panorama assist you actually build up the panorama slice by slice.  In either case this is a very valuable feature for me as I like to photograph mountains when I hike.The camera can take some extremely beautiful night time pictures.

Jones", "ReviewID": "R1397IR9M7Z2HT", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Greetings,I bought a Nikon Coolpix P300 a couple of days ago to replace a Cannon SD1000 that recently quit working. My primary camera is a Nikon D7000, but I like to have a smaller compact to carry with me in situations where I don't want the lug a big bag around. I won't go through all the detailed specs on the camera since you can find those in dpreview's detailed review. I just wanted to share my initial impressions from a real-world user's perspective.1. Construction. This thing seems reasonably well built, but does not have the same tank-like feel of the SD1000. I never had any worries about slipping the SD1000 into my back pocket and leaving it there (even if I sat down on it). While the P300 will fit in my pocket, I doubt it would fair as well if actually sat on.2. Controls / Menus. The control layout is fine and very usable. I like the dual wheel control. The menus are easy to navigate. I wish there was a way to program the wheel not being used in aperture to shutter priority mode to control the ISO.3. Image Quality. The image quality is good. Not large sensor DSLR great, but good. I was concerned after reading a lot of reviews that the images might appear over-sharpened, but this is really not the case (or maybe I just prefer my images a little over-sharpened). I haven't had a chance to really put the camera through its paces, but thus far, I'm pleased with the image quality.4. Video. I didn't buy the camera for video, but it is always nice to have that capability. The P300 has a couple of interesting modes that I haven't had the chance to play around with yet. I have shot some sample normal 1080 video, and it seems to work well enough for a P&S; camera. Some reviewers have commented that the AF doesn't work well in video mode, but I found it worded perfectly well using single point AF (which it what I use 90% of thI haven't Ihaven't tried it with other modes.5. Other Features. The camera has several other interesting scenes/features that I probably won't use on a regular basis and haven't tried out yet such as the Night Landscape mode, HDR, and Panorama.6. Overall Impression. I like it a lot. I like the sort of retro boxy look (I hate the current rounded look of the Cannon P&S; cameras). I seriously considered the Cannon S95 over this camera, but in the end went with the P300 due to the wider (and faster lens), better LCD, looks, and cheaper price. I know many feel the 1/2.3 sensor can't compete with the 1/1.7, but I honestly can't tell that much difference in the examples I've seen posted, and to be honest, they both fall well short of my D7000.If you want a small convienent P&S; camera with some manual control and decent low light performance, I don't think you'll go wrong with this camera.Kurt", "Date": "July 31, 2011"}, {"Title": "Perfect combination", "Author": "Neil Suhre", "ReviewID": "R3MY0SMAX100KK", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I've been searching for an easy-to-carry companion to my Olympus DSLR - a mix of image quality, portability, and features.  Spent a lot of time reading reviews, comparing specs, etc. and had my choice narrowed down to the Nikon P7000 and the Nikon P300.Very different cameras to be sure.  The toughest question I had to answer in my mind was, \"What is most important?  Portability or features?\"  While I loved everything I read and experienced about the P7000, portability won out in the end and I chose the P300.Knowing I was giving away some features and, perhaps (based on a number of reviews) some image quality, I was a bit skeptical when the camera came in.  I'm happy to say that my skepticism was short lived.So far, so good - really good!  For the price (sub $300), the combination of features and image quality are fantastic.  As others have mentioned about cameras in this range, they will not compare to the DSLR in terms of either features or quality, but for what it is, it fits the bill perfectly.The f1.8 lens, at the wide angle, delivers great low light and macro quality.  Across the range, again, I'm quite pleased with the image quality versus my last point and shoot.  Have mostly experimented with P and M mode - P for those times when I really want to simply point and shoot.  I find the buttons and menus very intuitive even though they differ from my Olympus, which makes moving into Manual mode a snap.Though I didn't buy it for it's video capability, I have used it with very satisfactory results.  Shooting friends playing badminton, the P300 kept up with the fast action and produced usable audio.  My friends were amazed at the quality while viewing the video in camera.I continue to put it through it's paces, but for now, I am totally satisfied with the P300.

I've owned several Panasonic cameras with Leica lens in the past because I love their clarity and sharpness. However, this time I decided to give Coolpix P300 a try instead of going for the LX5.What I needed is a camera that is compact, and takes good pictures in low light. I have a 2 months old baby who is most playful starting from 9pm until dawn. So the camera needs to be able to capture motion in a dimly lit room.After owning it for 3 weeks and taking shots in various lighting conditions, I can say for certain this camera deserves 5 stars in terms of low light capability.Images are not as sharp or clean as Leica (when you compare at 100%), but every moment is captured exceptionally well. The colors are accurate even with mixed or minimal lighting, and the lens are fast. I have absolutely no complaint about the image quality.  What I am a little uncertain is the casing.  As said by another reviewer, it does feel flimsy. Like, you can break it if holding it too tightly kind of flimsy.  Also, the auto focusing on the video seems a bit off when you zoom in during recording.Other than that, this is a perfect camera because in addition to consistently producing great images:Its price is budget friendlyIt has a big and really, really nice screen.Excellent HD movie recording capability.Its menu is easy to navigate.Shutter and aperture setting give photographer lots of freedom to be creative.I am sure there are cameras that can do better, such as Olympus XZ-1, but it will also cost significantly more.", "Date": "May 21, 2011"}, {"Title": "AWSOME OUTDOORSMAN CAMERA", "Author": "mjh", "ReviewID": "R1EHG9LA20NLWV", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Being in the outdoors a lot was looking for small ,easy to use ,quality camera.

I am happy with the Nikon.  Here is some comparison against the DSLR and other P&S;:- I was able to get hold of Canon S95 and tested S100 at the store.  The lens sharpness on the P300 is very comparable to the ones on S95 and S100.- The color from S95/S100 seems to be more realistic, but the Nikon color is more pleasant.  However, I found there is less noise in Nikon in low light condition probably because of Nikon's cooler white balance.- I prefer the shuttle click in Nikon because I can trust there will be a picture taken.  For Canon, it would not fire a shot if it cannot get a focus lock.  This is especially important for me.  I found I'd often miss a picture when I asked someone to take a picture because it would not get a focus lock.- Some people complain that the F1.8 does not provide enough depth of field.  I found the opposite.  I think it is an advantage to have deep depth of field for the P&S.;  I mainly use P&S; for my travel and family vacation.  I would be able to use F1.8 for the low light condition while keeping everything in focus.  I can never do the same with my Canon 85mm f1.8 lens on the DSLR's.- The video on Nikon is not as nice as those on the Canon and Sony.  The video is \"jumpy\", and the IS is not smooth.  However, the IS for the still picture is very impressive.

I'm extremely impressed with all the features this little camera packs in for such an amazing price.  I was able to get a couple of  photos of hummingbirds that were actually better than my SLR because the lens in the P300 is so fast.  In this case I found shooting via \"live view\" in the monitor actually made it easier to get the shot than shooting thru my SLRs view finder because my eye wasn't stuck up against the camera and I could see the birds coming in for a landing and actually get the lens on them [if you've ever shot hummingbirds you know how frustrating it is to get the focus right on them because they move so fast]. The menus are intuitive and extremely easy to navigate, and second nature to any Nikon user.  I had the menus mostly mastered in the first shooting without reading the manual.  The controls are easy for quickly changing shutter speed and aperture while shooting, and getting at the ISO is just another click.  The picture quality is what you'd expect from a Nikon.There are some things that aren't perfect for my taste, but I'm willing to put up with them in a compact camera.I find that it over exposes in manual. I've read complaints about this in other Nikon DSLRs, although I don't find it to be true in mine, but in any event, I compensated by under exposing a bit and I'll set an exposure compensation for it.  This is easy enough to tweak when shooting in shade or inside, but when shooting with the full sun at your back forget about shooting in manual because you can't see the monitor to adjust settings because of glare.  You can't see the exposure indicator at all even though +/- exposure is highlighted in yellow.  Not having shot with live view before, given that my DSLR settings are well-lit in the view finder no matter what the shooting environment, I found this inability to set shooting parameters in the sun a huge fail, but I imagine this is a problem in any camera that has manual settings and requires shooting from live view.  I guess I'll have to shoot in a landscape or other scene setting when shooting outside in the sun but I'm not especially happy about that.The video is awesome, both visual and sound quality, but shooting in 3D 1080p creates a file that's not going to play smoothly on most computers because of their limitations in video card acceleration and monitor resolution.  I have a fast NVIDIA video card designed for gaming and, along with my maximum computer monitor resolution of 1280 x 800,  it can't handle that video playback without significant stuttering.  I'm going to try to play it on my HD television and see how that does.  It also created a 4 min video that came in at 650MB [!!], which is almost the size of an entire movie file.  This is just a case of an improvement in one technology [the P300] creating incompatibilities with existing technology.  Given there are six video shooting speeds, this is not actually a problem at all, just giving readers the heads up on challenges to playing the full 3D 1080p vid on other devices besides the camera itself.The one thing that does bug me about the video is that it saves the files in .MOV format, the one format that many video editing and compression programs don't handle.  So, for example, to compress the video I describe above so that it can play on a typical computer and be small enough to upload to Vimeo or Flickr or Facebook, I'd use Virtual Dub....doesn't work with .mov.  So now I have to find something to convert the .mov to something I can work with.  Pain in the neck.  Maybe I can reset the camera to shoot in a more common video format.  I'll actually have to read the manual to find this one out.That Nikon did not include an external charger for this camera is kind of lame, but maybe at this price point doing so was not feasible.  Spend the extra 25 bucks and get an external charger so that you can charge an extra battery or charge the one with the camera much more quickly than charging it in the camera.  The built in charger takes much longer and comes with a large cord, which takes up valuable space if you're packing this kit for travel.  I purchased an extra battery and the external charger.  I've gotten great battery performance with shooting multiple 1080 movies and a couple of hundred photos at highest quality.  It appears as though I still have a full battery, but I know that sometimes the battery indicators drop all of a sudden; ergo, extra battery.", "Date": "September 1, 2011"}, {"Title": "Very worthy little camera", "Author": "Q", "ReviewID": "RF61KX548YXTR", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Reasons to buy:Small and light: pocket size with built in lens cover.

For example, the \"on\" button is so small that you have to use your fingernail to turn it on and off.Autofocus is unreliable in very low light, and at extreme close range (hence the four star rating).Given the fact that there are two dials in addition to the main mode selector, there should be more quick 'n easy access to picture taking adjustments. For example, in \"Scene\" mode, you have to call up the menu to change scene. It would be a lot more convenient to use the scroll dial on top. In \"scene\" and \"auto\" modes, both dials don't do anything. And in P, S, and A mode, only one dial is active, and the other dial doesn't do anything. Only in full manual mode are both dials active. The other dial could be used to adjust ISO or exposure (in auto or scene mode).When the ISO is automatically raised above the base sensitivity of 160, the letters \"ISO\" appear on the view screen; but there is no indication of what precise ISO is currently in use, which would be much more helpful.Door on battery and memory card is fragile, & flimsy, but you don't have to use the door on a regular basis since you can charge your battery and download photos through the usb cable.The flap that hides the usb cable is very thin and flimsy.Overall, I'm glad I bought this camera and I use it regularly when I need something small and light to carry around for hiking or sightseeing.", "Date": "August 20, 2011"}, {"Title": "Excellent Camera", "Author": "Nick", "ReviewID": "RU3WP4W5LB303", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Recently bought this camera as a gift to myself.

Hope to take some creative pics and post soon.I was wanting to buy the P310 (which is still not available as of Feb 2012) but settled for the p300 as it is cheaper and doesn't have a 16 mp sensor (a bad idea IMO for such small sensors). Also considered the canon s100 but that is too expensive and the G1x's price is simply obscene. Sony Hx9v was another option but the lens on p300 is way better.Now for the irritants:1- Proprietary charging port- Nikon, why? Not to mention the brick like wall adapter that is half the camera size.2- The charging equipment mentioned above makes it hard to fit the whole camera + adapter+USB connector in a portable case that can be attached to your belt. I am still struggling to find one on amazon.3- The battery indicator on LCD is not dependable. It goes from fully charged to half suddenly and then within a few shots it drains completely. If you see it at half level, safely assume it is 95% consumed and recharge asap. I hope P310 has his fixed. I guess my big G12 battery has spoilt me.4- The playback button needs to be pressed longer than expected in order to turn on the camera without extending the lens. At first i thought the only way to see images was by turning the camera on completely by pushing the power button. I haven't read the manual so this may be my bad.5- Finally, the images do not rotate when you rotate the camera (like it does in the iphone and G12). Maybe it is not a feature. I also hear a low ticking sound each time i shake the camera. Maybe it is the VR system but i dont know. If any of you also hear it please comment.

I carry this backpacking (on multi-day trips when weight is an issue), I carry it at work for quick random shots, and I have it in the car \"just in case\". If I plan to shoot RAW, that's just it: I PLAN to shoot RAW. If I'm going to bother shooting RAW, I'll use my DSLR - that's why I have it. I bought this to be a P&S; that I could simply use to take a picture when planning isn't possible and this camera truly delivers. Shots are colorful, sharp and well exposed. Low light photography (don't care for on-camera flash) is exceptional. Gives you Aperture and Shutter Priority modes, full Manual and Programed Auto along with full Auto (which I never use), exposure compensation, and color saturation and hue adjustment options just to name a few. Some of the scene modes are actually kind of useful and I find myself using them at times when I'm rushed and have to fire a shot quickly or miss it. Showed some photos I took indoors with no flash to several photography enthusiasts (Nikon, Canon and Sony DSLR users) and their response was \"WOW, you took those pictures with THAT?!?\" The f1.8 lens (beating out all the competition in this price range) is far more valuable then shooting RAW (in my opinion). If shooting RAW is what keeps you from buying this camera, you're missing the point. This isn't meant to replace a DSLR, it's a camera for those of us who own one but can't carry it everywhere and can't stand not having artistic control when photographing (so a \"regular\" P&S; just won't cut it for us). Learn to get the exposure you want in-camera (or at least close to it) and you won't worry about shooting jpeg from a Point & Shoot. Keep in mind that despite how much I LOVE this camera it IS a point and shoot. Don't try to compare it to a DSLR as I keep seeing in other reviews. It just isn't that. But it is the best P&S; I've owned or used and don't regret choosing this for an instant!", "Date": "March 13, 2012"}, {"Title": "COOLPIX P300", "Author": "P.

I wanted to shop around though because I've known a good number of people who bought DSLR cameras to take pictures of their babies only to find that they never use it.  The last thing they want to do is lug around another bulky bag.  The P300 is large enough to be sturdy but still small enough to carry around and use regularly.Additional features that make it great for new babies:  - Excellent low light pictures and image stability  - Rapid start up allows you to capture quick shotsWhat the P300 is NOT:It is not a professional grade camera.  If you want to make large prints and have perfect lighting, this isn't the camera for you.  We ultimately decided that we wouldn't be staging large photo shoots for our infant and so moved down to cameras at a lower price point.Summary:The P300 is essentially a high end camera for the casual photographer.

The pictures were crystal clear on the brilliant high res screen.  Indoor low light pictures were beautiful with NO flash!!  Everyone was amazed.  Then went on my trip and experienced the following.  First, don't buy the camera for the zoom.  Yes, it works well for the short distance pics, like for portraits.  But for wildlife, even at a relatively close range, will not give you the satisfaction as a more powerful zoom.  But I knew this going into this purchase...maybe the next generation p300 will have a better zoom.  Now for the problem...during my trip, I used my video for the first time.  It seemed to work well, until I used the zoom.  Then the camera froze with 'lens error' appearing on the screen.  Had to remove the battery to reboot the camera and get it working again.  So tried the video under different settings and circumstances and whenever the zoom was used, the camera froze with lens error.  When I got home, I called Nikon and went through the usual reseting the camera, recharging the battery, changing memory cards, etc. and after 4-5 phone calls, they finally said I needed to send in the Camera to Nikon to be serviced.  My new camera, a month old, already needing service...and I had to pay the shipping to them!!  Then I get an email, saying it was not under warranty and the cost would be $87.  Of course, I called and explained everything and the foreign rep put me on hold and came back and said there was a mistake and it should be under warranty and she would email be that confirmation immediately.  Never received it so I called back and the new foreign rep told me she (the last rep) made a mistake in telling me that and the service dept. would have to review the warranty and get back to me.  Several days passed and I heard nothing, so I called back.  Put on hold and eventually, they came back with...yes it is covered under warranty.  It will be fixed in 7-10 business days and returned to me.I was never worried about coverage since it was paid for by a credit card which has separate coverage.  But this whole episode has left a bad taste in my mouth with Nikon.  I will have to think twice about Nikon purchases in the future or buy it at Best Buy and get their warranty coverage.  Let's hope this is an isolated flaw just in my camera and not a design problem with the zoom during the video mode creating that lens error.Follow-up....After 2 weeks, finally got the camera back, but it still had the same problem...it was NOT fixed...unbelievable!  This time, I call Nikon USA corporate who had someone from service return my call.  They had me send the camera back, at heir cost.  When received, he confirmed it was still coming up with 'lens error'.  Said all they did last time was a firmware update and thought that should have fixed the problem.  NOT!

I understand that you can also freeze the motion by setting the shutterspeed, but I was looking for something to get quick snapshots of my daughter.

Previous camera was a Canon ELPH that also takes great pictures, but being 5 years old it's just outdated technology.  The Canon is still going strong, but that's the wife's and I needed one for my business.  This Nikon P300 is amazing.  First of all the f1.8 lens combined with the image stabilization allows you to take photos that simply are impossible with the older digitals (forget the old SLR's).  I have taken photos in auto mode with NO FLASH at 1/5 of a second shutter speed, hand held, and you can count the threads in the clothing when magnifying the photo.  You can't hold a camera freehand at that slow shutter speed and get a clear photograph.  Well you can now.  OK, maybe I'm just impressed coming from an older camera.  But really, the flash seems to be of very limited need.  Took a photo of a darkened room I could not see the other side of, but the camera could, with no flash.  The photo makes the room look likes its in daylight.  How's it do that?  The auto-scene mode is really neat.  The camera reads the situation and adjusts itself for the best photo.  Took some photos of a rising moon that look almost professional.  And the sunrises and sunsets are much better than I've been able to get with the older camera.  One downside is it does not come with an external battery charger.  You're supposed to charge the battery in the camera, I guess while you're sleeping?  Shame on Nikon, but its a cheap workaround.  There's dozens of after market battery chargers for under $10 on AMAZON, and one kit that includes 110VAC charger, cigarette adapter, and two high capacity batteries, all for under $20.  I got the PowerGen that charges a wide range of batteries for under $10 and it works great.So I have yet to find a scene or image this camera cannot capture if I set it properly.  And in most cases it sets itself.  Oh yeah, the flash.  The flash does not pop up automatically.  You slide a small catch when you think you may need the flash and it pops up on the top left of the camera.  But there is still room for your finger so you can hold the camera firmly.  Great solution over the S8200 that just pops up unexpectedly.  The camera regularly warns you that the flash is down, so you shouldn't miss any shots due to lack of flash.  And again, the lens is so fast (light sensitive) that you very often don't need the flash anyway.  I took several great shots thinking that surly the flash was needed, but there was no flash.  I then remembered that I had forgotten to pop the flash up, but the P300 captured the shot anyway.  When you do need the flash it is very bright.  I know I have taken flash shots out to 30 feet with plenty of light to do the job, and that was outdoors at night.I've had the camera for only two weeks, and have a lot to learn.  But so far I could not be more pleased.  I shopped for weeks and think I definitely got the most camera for the buck, and a great camera at any price.

It is in the Landscape menu. The camera quickly makes several exposures,  and then,  in about ten seconds,  calculates the final picture (slightly cropped w.r. to what you see on the screen).  Big plus: the picture looks better (quite good even at ISO 1000), chromatic aberration (color fringing) disappears (there is not much of it, anyway).  Minus: you have no control over  ISO, aperture.  Works only at speeds shorter then 1/30 s. Even so, I like NR - for objects that are not moving.  Other pluses of this camera: very good wide angle shots with excellent  1.8 aperture, good stabilizer. Can you get a Canon or Nikon DSLR with stabilization at f/1.8, even if you are willing to spend many times more? Manual control: P,A,S modes.  It has three levels of HDR. I prefer the first one, since too much HDR makes pictures artificial/ unnatural.  The  BSS (Best Single Shot) works on P300 only at at speeds shorter then 1/30 s. The camera takes several exposures and chooses the best one. This camera is very fast. So why does not this work at slower speeds? I had a much slower Nikon camera with BSS,  which took seconds to make the six to nine  exposures  (necessary for BSS).  I wish Nikon P300 could use BSS (and maybe even NR) at slower speeds,  in the A (aperture priority mode),  as this would  be very useful in low light.

The glass is vastly superior to my last Canon AIS 720 which was crap--if that was indicative of Canon quality I will never own another--all of my old Fuji's had better lenses than the Canon.  I have gotten used to the lack of a viewfinder (it is just a habit you developed, you really can't see anything through those things anyway, do you!).  This has enough manual settings that you do not need to use to occupy any photo nerd and the auto setups make much more logical sense than just allowing/requiring you to manipulate every variable, but--given the ease of fixing digital images after the fact, all the settings are IMHO more or less superflous.  I think the only weak point is the hotness of the flash--it creates a hot center in your pictures that I have not seen with some others when close in---but you can take pictures in such low light with this camera that the flash is less important.

It's small, and it has the option to make a lot of manual adjustments, although not as many as some people would like. As for me, I am perfectly content to use the scene modes, letting the camera do the work for me. And there is a nice array: Portrait, landscape, sports, night portrait, party/indoor, beach, snow, sunset, dusk/dawn, close-up, food, museum, fireworks show, black and white, panorama, pet portrait, night landscape...just remember to put the flash up or it won't go off.

I have worked my way thru 5 sucessive generations of Canon digital elphs, the S410 up to SD780 IS, including a SX110Is and recently decided to upgrade to one of the new BiCMOS compact cameras which allow 1080p HD videos. As my grandkids started arriving I found I also wanted to have high quality videos of them. I avoided the new line of Canon BiCMOS cameras because of the poor location of the flash which produces a shadow of the lens during wide angle flash photos.I ended up buying a Nikon P300 in March. As a still camera it has excellent image and color sharpness when it works, but I have found that it has focusing problem for stills and especially when doing videos. I had numerous discussion with Nikon online service which do not seem well informed about specifics of this camera - at least not at the level of a photo enthusiast. (They can tell you simple things about the operation but are pretty shallow in understanding photography issues.) I sent files of the movies showing the focusing problem, reset all the settings as they requested (no effect) and finally sent the camera back to their US east coast service center in April. They told me the camera was within specifications and returned it to me with the lens cleaned of course!  SO CLEARLY NIKON HAS EVALUATED MY CAMERA AND FINDS THAT IT IS WORKING AS DESIGNED ! UGHHH!After extensive testing of the video even after coming back from their service center, it appears that the lens design of this camera is very poor and will not even closely maintain a focus when starting from wide angle and zooming in, even in bright sunlight. After focusing on a contrasty, distant object in the focus bracket, and then zooming in, everything goes out of focus. And by panning the camera after zooming to find the focus distant, it appears to be focused 4 feet away ! SO clearly the lens focusing mechanism is messed up since once the focus is set on a distant object (near infinity) it should remain fixed (or at least nearly so) as the lens is zoomed in.So for example, if your child is on a sunny beach say 50 feet away and you start with a wide angle video focused on your child and then zoom in, everything goes out of focus. Even objects at essentially infinity go out of focus! I posted some examples of frames from such videos on a photo blog for those wanting to see how bad it is: [...]I have also found that 2 out of every 10 still shots of people on the Nikon P300 also turn out to be out of focus -not quite as bad as the videos - but still noticable on a 4x5 and clearly noticable on a 17\" PC display.Out of frustration with missing these videos and stills on the Nikon P300, I recently purchased another BiCMOS camera - a Samsung TL350. This Samsung model seems to be highly under-appreciated based on the reviews. ( Probably because Samsung does not have the \"reputation\" in photography that Nikon or Canon do.) The TL350 also does 1080 HD videos and has much more reliable focusing than the Nikon P300. The Samsung TL300 allows you to zoom in from wide angle and the object remains in focus! ( as it should with any camera !) So the identical videos zoom shots that became out of focus on the Nikon remain razor sharp on the Samsung !In terms of still shots on the SL3050, a few out of every 100 shots may be slightly out of focus which is a reasonable hit rate for me. The overall sharpness on the pictures from the SL350 is virtually identical to the Nikon p300 eventhough the Samsung is 10 megapixel versus the Nikon's 12 megapixel sensor; and the Samsung allows more control over settings, if you so desire - such as color balance for different lighting conditions as well as saving a raw file along with a jpeg file. The main negatives of the Samsung SL350 is that the zoom does occasionally create a clicking noise when filming and the zoom is abit too fast ( makes your video look very amateurish.) There is a setting on the Samsung that allows the sound to be disabled during zoom which works fine since for these telephoto zoom shots your subject cannot be heard anyway.Another attractive feature of the Samsung is that it allows time lapse as well as high speed photography ( up to 1000 frames per second) even thought at these higher speeds the resolution is significantly degraded. It allows some really fun movies of the grandkids ! The build quality of the Samsung is really solid and impresive and reminded me of the older solid Canon digital elphs, unlike the the Nikon P300 which seems more flimsy.One plus for the Nikon is that the colors that come directly out are bright and vivid, and properly color corrected - as seemed the case with Canon digital elphs - thereby not requiring any further post processing (which I tend to do anyway on my best photos!) In comparison the Samsung images taken at the same time under the same conditions need a slight color correction. (My daughter who has a photography degree from RISD said that it is a trivial correction and that both cameras produced virtually identical photos and videos.) Note that there have been many discussions of the advantages of Nikon's f1.8 lens, but I find that in my shots, the camera rarely goes this low on auto mode - it seems to prefer to always lengthen the shutter speed instead. (Also the F1.8 aperature is only for the wide angle lens.)", "Date": "July 13, 2011"}, {"Title": "Wish I had gotten a different camera", "Author": "sally", "ReviewID": "R3DD6EV1YI7O3Z", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "I did extensive research prior to purchasing this camera almost 6 months ago.

I didn't have a compatible SD card so I tested on internal memory after formatting it. With 90mb of internal memory I think I can get about 40 pictures for now.

After confirming the driver had loaded I then clicked on my Computer in the Vista Start menu and sure enough the P300 icon was there and I clicked into the folder until I found the photos.  I didn't have to bother installing the Nikon software that came with the camera.  I just selected the photos I wanted and copied them to my Pictures folder in Windows.  After pasting the photos I use a photo editor I like Corel's PaintShop Pro to crop or edit the photos.  I have used Adobe's Photoshop but I like the frugal and easier-to-use PaintShop Pro. You can pick up the older software version on eBay for $13.00. The Nikon saves in jpeg format so I am pleased.  I like to keep things simple.I had a bit of a tough time using my big finger to jog in the date and the time in the camera.  The control is a bit sensitive to off-center hits.

I like the fast F 1.8 lense that will allow more light in.  The result of low light images without flash are very good.  However the panorama pictures are not as good as I expected.  There are two moods you can select.  The first one is easy panorama, which gives you a picture directly from the camera but the picture files are very small, only 900 some pixels in height and the image does not freeze moveing objects as well as the Sony wx 5 camera does.  The second one is panorama assist mood, you need to use the computer to complete the sequential pictues into one.  In this mood you can set your file size and zoom setting of your choice.  I did not make many HD movie tests. The mic seems to pick up lots of noise when I was taken it in a quite room.  This may be true for all small pocket cameras.  The battery is charged inside the camera body.  The charging wire has a USB plug at the other end connecting to the AC adapter. So you may use the same wire upload the image files to a PC without taking the SD card out and get the battery charged as well at the same time.

We have used the camera inside our house for several days, doing test shots under different conditions (everybodies house is lit different) and played them on our hdtv.

I took more than 400 pictures with it during this time.  The image quality is great, and some of the scenes it rendered beautifully -- shooting into the sun, sunsets, backlit scenes -- were spectacular, better than any point and shoot I have ever had (Sony Cybershot; Canon Powershot being my most recent ones, both malfunctioning after a year or two).  There are many options readily understandable on its program, and I particularly liked the ability to chose aperture or shutter priority modes.  The \"scene\" program (for shooting fireworks, night scenes) looked like fun, but using it was not intuitive in the field, even though I read through the complete guide prior to my trip.  The camera simply excelled in low light situations.  Its drawbacks are related to ergonomics -- in a hurry, it was hard to find the tiny power on switch.  It was too easy to press the wrong prominence on the top of the camera when one wanted to activate the shutter.  The camera is larger and heavier than the typical point and shoot, and it is surprising how much difference  an ounce or two and a slightly increased thickness makes when one tries to carry the camera in a pants or shirt front pocket.  In summary, a great camera which was worth the extra expense in terms of image quality, but not so good for its ergonomics and its heft.  The picture quality was worth putting up with these drawbacks, however.Additional comments:  I have revisited this review after  more than a year's heavy use of the camera.  It traveled again with me on another hiking trip, and once again, the camera functioned flawlessly, with striking picture quality in all kinds of lighting and weather.  The picture quality was particularly good in very low-light settings.

The only flaw I see with the camera is the cord.  The cord is used to both transfer photos as well as charge the camera (no batteries / quick swaps), which means you better have a full charge and check before leaving an electric outlet anywhere you go.  But that's a minor issue... the cord uses a proprietary end to it that no other camera uses but Nikon.  That means if you lose this cord, your camera is a brick.  Can you buy a new cord from Nikon, sure, but I personally dislike when companies do things like this because it ultimately hurts the consumers.

A little background; I am a professional freelance fashion photographer with 5+ years of experience with cameras, and Nikon in particular.I had been researching for a decent point and shoot camera to accompany me during every day trips, and especially for night time / low light club & event photography. Originally I had purchased the Sony WX9, which besides the extreme noise reduction algorithms and extreme smudging of detail at high ISO, I was somewhat pleased with the camera (my favorite feature was the Superior Auto mode that combined up to 6 shots for an \"HDR\" effect).Not quite 100% satisfied with the WX9, I set out to compare a few other cameras, and due to price and a few other factors, finally settled between \"upgrading\" to the WX10 (hard to get locally), or the P300 (also hard to get locally). I decided the WX10 was close enough to the WX9, so I would instead try out the Nikon P300 to see how it faired.After receiving it in next day air shipping from Amazon.com, I returned it within 24 hours. Here's why.Unwrapping the P300, everything seemed decent. It is pretty light, a bit too square for my tastes but it is easy to hold. Like some other reviewers mentioned, the casing seems to be made of some high grade plastic and not metal. It felt solid, but just looked like an amateurish toy camera in my hands. I also didn't like that the speaker holes were right inside the tiny grip on the right side, somewhat counter intuitive. I'm not a fan of the extra \"mode dial\" on top either, it's usually where the shutter button is and my finger kept wanting to press it to shoot.Being a long time Nikon user, the P/A/S/M controls were easy to use, however I was disappointed in the lack of Scene modes. The 921k screen was very nice, but one thing that bugged me was that it did not automatically update the screen when changing exposure/iso/shutter/aperture. Most newer cameras do this standard. Taking pictures was pretty easy, I did not see any noticeable Auto Focus \"seeking\", and it was tested in my room with very low ambient light levels. I will say this, it had great exposure of dark/night shots, even without the HDR setting, which takes me to another gripe. The HDR effect is only available as a Scene setting. This would be much better if available as an optional setting for ALL Scene modes.By this point my old WX9 or even the untested WX10 seemed better suited for my tastes. I prefer the punchier, more vivid colors of the Sony sensor as compared to the Nikon P300 out of the box. Granted, I did not play around with the saturation controls, so take it with a grain of salt. I'm not bashing the IQ of the P300, indeed, it does seem to have slightly better detail (less smudging) vs the Sony P&S;'s, but still far worse than say a P&S; with a larger sensor and higher pixel count. I also found the sheer lack of settings and options available very frustrating. Sure to some the Sony cameras may seem like overkill with their features, but I would rather have MORE settings and features available to me than LESS. The P300 did OK with panoramas, nothing great. The HDR Backlight was alright, but only combined two shots I believe. It was difficult to get a steady snapshot of myself while hand holding the camera, I thought it came with auto shooting smile/face recognition, perhaps I was mistaken. Another feature that should be commonplace nowadays.What really broke the deal for me was the P300's video mode. In summary, one word: HORRID. The HD video is jumpy, dismal low light AF/tracking, and the zooming motor is EXTREMELY loud in the video, and there is no feature for noise level reduction such as \"wind noise reduction\". I did not bother testing the 120fps high speed mode.All in all, it IS a decent camera, but if you are looking for something to take quick and steady shots that look great no matter what the environment with features to cover most of your needs (and then some), look elsewhere. If I had the money I would probably look into the Canon S95 (hate that lens ring though). I ordered my WX10 and am sure to be happy with it considering how much I enjoyed the WX9.", "Date": "June 26, 2011"}, {"Title": "Prefer the S95", "Author": "D.

Some facts - I'm a casual photographer but I hate using something like the Canon SD1400 - too slow and the pictures are more often bad then good.  Got the S95 and have been using this as my point and shoot camera ever since (I have a D90 for the bigger stuff like the kids playing sports).  Picked up the P300 because we needed one for work.  My personal thoughts are1. The S95 takes better shots2. The S95 has a better screen3. The S95 is easier to use4. The video on the P300 is choppy (one of the primary reasons I went with this camera)5. The charging system is asinineNow I've read that lowering the video quality can help and wish I had done that before I really needed it.  I know I can purchase a separate charger (negating some of the savings over the S95) and I know that plenty of people will say this takes just as good of a shot and is easier to use.

All three camera I tested are good.2) Indoor image quality is the best among the ones I tested.  Even though it is not perfect, the color, noise and focus are decent when keeping the image not higher than ISO 400.3) HD video is decent.  P300 pick up some background noise but not too bad.4) I like the position of the flash (left with popup).  The shadow caused by the flash is minimal (unlike the HX7V).5) Menu is very responsive.6) Focus is fast.

It is the default size to printing 4x6 photos.2) The auto mode has only center only focus instead of auto select focus.  Very strange.  So, P is the auto mode actually for this camera.I actually like the canon 500 HS a lot too bad it has several flaws to me.1) 500 HS has a crazily loud motor noise when you zoom in/out during the video shoot.2) Touch screen is not good.  Selection is ok.  But scrolling is hopeless. Also, very easy to select something randomly.3) 720p video size is bigger than P300 (almost double).  May be file format related.4) Inconsistent indoor photo quality.HX7V has 2 fatal flaws I cannot tolerate:1) Slow.  Menu selection is very slow when browsing photo or delete.  It takes 4 sec for it to actually record video after pressing the button.2) I hate the shadow caused by the flash.Feature that are in Canon 500 HS I would like to have in P3001) 3x2 aspect ratios2) Less background noise when shooting video with no zooming.3) More interesting body colorsFeature that are in HX7V I would like to have in P3001) Shooting 2MP photo while shooting video", "Date": "May 18, 2011"}, {"Title": "Great camera but very delicate", "Author": "MiamiMedic", "ReviewID": "R2PXTRMG78N49I", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "The P300 has set a new standard for cameras.For those that love their DSLR but hate looking like a dork when you taking it to bars,clubs,dinner,etc this camera is for you.The manual features are superb with easy access to shutter speed and F-stop controls you most definitely would be able to take just as good pictures as with your DSLR you left at home.I cant wait to use my P300 at night with its f1.8 lens.But keep in mind it will not stay at f1.8 at all zoom ranges.Its 1080p video also looks great but haven't really tried it out yet.Also its LCD is HUGE unlike most other cameras you can actually see the details of pictures you take.Why I gave it four starsReceiving this camera today my first impression upon removing it from the box it that I will break it.For its average size it has no weight.Compared to an Olympus PEN and an SN95 which feel like they can survive a fall the P300 feels like something might crack.Besides its lack of protection or sense of security the camera is just amazing.", "Date": "March 24, 2011"}, {"Title": "great features above average IQ", "Author": "\u00ae", "ReviewID": "R1Z19ZL2X03FM2", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I used my Nikon D7000 like 95% of the time.

I think it takes good images but not the best (but good for the price).  It is weak indoor like all other P&S; (without the flash) producing noise.Positive:1. Metal body most in this price range is plastic.2. PASM and single point auto focus is very good. IT is very intuitive.3. Does its own HDR (not bracketing) and panorama works fine.4.

That case is definitely only for P300. I have a liking for leather cases. But, sadly, I had to return that one too. There was no free space with the camera inside it, like no room at all. You also have to be a little careful while using that case and will have to explain to others how it works. I didn't want something that was complicated in any way. It looks nice though.- FINALLY, I got the 'Case Logic DCB-302' case. It's not a perfect case for P300 (and is not a leather case) but it's nice. It's got a pocket that can be used for an extra battery or a memory card.
