{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Fantastic underwater and land camera", "Author": "QC2010", "ReviewID": "RAVBGNIAMVR2L", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "You definitely want to take your time getting to know all of the features of the SeaLife cameras - this one is no exception. I still have a lot to play around with to nail down the perfect macro photos. But, if you have it in the right setting, you can take some phenomenal pictures. I had a DC1200 and just upgraded to the 1400 and have no complaints, it's a fantastic dive camera and I'd argue one of the best - especially if you're just a leisure (aka, not a technical photographer) diver. It does have the flash and other add ons if you want to get more technical with your photos. Great buy!", "Date": "March 4, 2013"}, {"Title": "great pics", "Author": "Jennifer H.", "ReviewID": "RKN0BNRQ47J5B", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "pretty good quality pics without spending crazy $$$ on large SLR housings. we will be using this as long as possible", "Date": "April 30, 2013"}, {"Title": "Love it", "Author": "tj", "ReviewID": "R1CJ8E2X3HX0R5", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Took it on two vacations diving. Worked great even at 100 feet. I was not horribly pleased with the snorkel setting. It is too much red. Diving it has been great though. The housing will take a good beating. It got hit a few times coming out of the water and once with my head when jumping off the boat. Battery lasts about 2 hours going in and off. I will be getting an extra battery before the next trip. Actual camera is great for regular use. I didn't even pull out my slr on the last trip. Best tip: hold down the shutter to focus and let go when ready to shot. It does have some lag time. Having the pink makes it easy to find when digging it out of the camera tub.", "Date": "July 27, 2013"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": null, "Features": null, "Name": null, "ImgURL": null, "ProductID": "B008F8CZ2U"}}
