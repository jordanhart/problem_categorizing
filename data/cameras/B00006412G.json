{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Impressive Camera", "Author": "Cal \"chuck2002\"", "ReviewID": "R2AFTULLWBSVW8", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I'm new to digital photography and was very impressed with Canon's A40.  The camera has similar features to the proven A20 model, but distinguishes itself in several ways. For example, the A40 feels solid and is very attractive.  It also captures 10-30 second movie clips in AVI format which can be played on Quicktime.  The movie images are a bit grainy, but movements and sounds are captured quite well.  Using some software which was included with the A40, I was able to convert the AVI clips into MPEG and view them on my PocketPC.  Finally, the camera is less expensive than the A20, but delivers the same quality images.  My experience with the A40 pictures is that 2Mexapixels are fine.  The clarity of the images is remarkable.  And making short movie clips is an added benefit to getting the A40.  For the price and photo quality, the A40 is an exceptional product and deserves everyone of its 5 stars.", "Date": "March 29, 2002"}, {"Title": "No more 35mm film for me", "Author": "A Customer", "ReviewID": "R2FD7S5MZ5O1EN", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "When I purchased this camera as my entry into the digital world, I wanted to get a camera that would serve two purposes in one. I wanted something easy enough to use that the technology of the thing was not overwhelming to a first time user and I wanted something that had enough in the way of features so that I would not feel as though I needed to get a bigger and better model in 6 months. I really feel that the Canon A-40 neatly fulfills those two needs. You can definitely get wrapped around the axle with all the cameras on the market these days. The feature list seems to be endless. In order to choose a camera that was right for me, I broke it down into the things that were important to me. 2 Megapixel camera - That number really translates into photo quality. With this camera you will be able to take and print JPEG images up to an 8x10 size with amazing clarity and detail. I thought at first that I should go for the maximum Megapixel rating possible but I have no need for prints of any larger size (besides my printer will not print anything larger.). I am quite pleased with the images that the camera produces with perhaps only a couple of exceptions but really nothing that deals with the resolution of the photos. 3X Optical Zoom and 4X Digital Zoom - For those of you who are familiar with a 35mm film camera the 3X Optical Zoom is the equivalent of 35mm-105mm zoom lens. One small complaint is that the zoom control is touchy and it can be difficult to adjust it into the proper range. With a bit of practice this can be overcome. The 4X optical zoom is selectable and works quiet well but there is a trade off (isn't all of life?). Using the digital zoom results in a loss of resolution with the image. For images that you send via e-mail this doesn't really represent a problem, but for those images that are to be printed it can become a factor. 1.5 inch LCD display and optic viewfinder - The optic viewfinder is a bit dinky and only shows about 80% of the actual recorded image. I have to confess I don't really use this feature preferring the LCD screen more. The LCD display on the other hand is another trade off. Although you get a bright color display of the image you are going to record, the screen tends to use battery power at an alarming rate. I was able to take over 100 photos with the regular alkaline batteries that were provided with the camera and didn't really see this as a serious problem. As a side note, I did purchase NIMH (nickel metal hydride) rechargeable batteries to use with the camera and have no complaints in this area. Compact Flash memory system - This is a great memory system in my opinion. It is small and relatively easy to use. The camera comes equipped with an 8MB-memory card. At the highest resolution this card will hold about 8 photos which I will admit is not many. I quickly relegated the 8-MB card to a reserve role and now use a 128-MB card. It is a bit intoxicating knowing I can take about 200 high quality images and not have to have them developed in the traditional sense. You can preview each image and delete the ones that you don't want or keep them all. The camera has a USB port for direct downloading to your computer or you can opt for a card reader, which does not require the camera. Beyond these basic features the camera will take pictures in a fully automatic mode (including flash) or will allow the uses to operate the camera in manual for a multitude of effects. I find that the auto settings work very well for the most part. My only complaint would be that from time to time the camera will flash when it probably shouldn't have and wash the photo out because of overexposure. This really isn't much of a problem in my opinion for two reasons. I didn't have to pay to have the photo developed to see the problem and it doesn't happen all that often. You can do some incredible things such as \"stitching\" photo after adjacent photo creating a 360-degree panoramic photo of your surroundings or recording short AVI format movies. Weighing in at 8.8 oz with the following dimensions - Depth 1.5 in, Height 2.8, in Width 4.3 in, This is not the most compact camera on the market so if your looking for the smallest model available you need to probably look elsewhere. I like it size though. It is just big enough to feel sturdy and durable but small enough to carry most places. I find that the camera controls are conveniently placed and are very user friendly. Most are menu driven with the LCD display providing necessary guidance to use the features. There are a wealth of accessories for this camera including replaceable lenses and a waterproof (to 200 feet) housing I haven't had the opportunity to use these items yet but when and if I do I will update this review. Overall I would have to say that I am very pleased with this camera and that I would not hesitate to recommend it to anyone.", "Date": "November 10, 2002"}, {"Title": "Best of the 2 megapixels - by far", "Author": "M. Burk", "ReviewID": "RJR8BD4SUF3NN", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This camera has so many great features and is very easy to use. Here are my best features on why I bought over other Canon camera or Fujis (My experience: NIKON COOLPIX is best for camera buffs, but this one beats all for everyday shooting, travel shooting, family photos, and professinal looking shots within budget - (...)(...)1. Largest resolution and largest size gives best 4x6 and 5x7 prints. I take all my photos on the CompactFlash card to Wolf Camera and they print them on their big machine. go professional for $.50 a photo - worth it everytime2. Can take one pix in color, the next in B&W;3. Can use manual mode for faster shutter speed and/or aperature setting. Or can use AUTO like I do everytime4. Flash red-eye works most of the time, but I do correct 2 out of 5 red-eyes b4 I take my pix to Wolf Camera with Adobe5. Software for PC and cable lets you attach cable to camera and turn it on with automatic download to your PC of new pictures. You can also go in and download older ones saved on the media card (CompactFlash)6. I like taking 5-7 pictures for one BEST shot. I then go through and delete the ones that did not come out well and print the one that did!7. Video capture is about 15 seconds with high resolution and plays well on the PC. Each file can be joined with Microsft Movie Player (XP) to create one long movie (AVI file) nd burned to a CD. You can view the movie on the camera too.8. Good depth of field. Not a wide angle, but some elements are achieved9. Viewing screen on the back is very good and wide10. Upgrade to a 64 MB or 128 MB card - the 8 MB included card is not enough for big photos11.  Zoom is excellent. On highest zoon, you can't be too close or too dark. The focus will not work evertime, but taking a step back works.12. Flash can be turned off for any shot13. you can review the pictures on the camera one by one or by a small grid (I think like 9 pictures). You can even zoom in on the pix you took on the camera and move it around.", "Date": "November 20, 2002"}, {"Title": "...amazing piece of technology!", "Author": null, "ReviewID": "R306HAHB42I4UH", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Color: great, accurate color when shooting outdoors and under the studio lighting. All in all though, the A40 produced unusually appealing color. Exposure: The A40 did a great job with exposure, capturing great midtones both indoor and outside. A40's exposure system worked very well, but did show a tendency to lose highlight detail in very contrasty lighting conditions. Sharpness: Image sharpness was good for a two-megapixel camera, with crisp details throughout the frame. Optical distortion was a bit better than average at the wide-angle lens setting.Closeups: The A40 came in a bit below average in the macro category, capturing a rather large minimum area of 6.56 x 4.92 inches. Color, detail, and resolution were all great, however.  Night Shots: The A40 did unusually well for an entry-level camera in my low light shooting tests.  Some of the lower light level shots had slightly soft focus, but results were good overall. The camera's noise reduction system did a reasonably good job of eliminating image noise.Battery Life: Battery life on the A40 is very good. In its worst-case power consumption mode (capture mode with the LCD screen turned on), it should run about 3 1/2 hours on a freshly-charged set of high-capacity NiMH AA batteries. With the LCD screen off, it can run for over 20 hours straight. Playback mode run time should be about 5-6 hours. This is really excellent, but you'd better purchase a couple of sets of rechargeable batteries still holds. Conclusion:The A40 is a nicely-designed, stylish, functional camera that take great pictures. The A40 has a nice sharp lens, and excellent color rendition. The Movie capture mode makes the A40 great for recording short clips of special events, while the Stitch-Assist mode lets you capture expansive panoramic shots. The 2.0-megapixel CCD produces good image quality, with enough detail to print images as large as 8x10 inches. If you're looking for a good entry-level camera with a range of options and excellent picture quality, you need look no further than the A40.Pros:...Very good photo quality...-Easy to use in point-and-shoot or manual modes-Excellent software bundle-Supports external lenses, underwater case-Solid Construction-High quality lens, Software, CCD add up to great pictures.-Lots of manual controls over exposure, f-stop, ISO etc.-Continous shooting at 3 frames/sec.-Built-in lens cover, so there's no worries about lens caps-Very good manual (177 pags)Cons:-No rechargeable batteries included-Sometimes slow shutter speed-No uncompressed file format (TIFF or RAW) only saves as JPEG-Macro mode not up to rest of the camera features-Drains regular Alkalines fairly fast-8MB memory won't be enough", "Date": "May 29, 2002"}, {"Title": "I love this camera!", "Author": "E. Hoffman", "ReviewID": "R2Z3RLINZS4NNY", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "...P>The Canon Powershot A40 is an excellent camera, especially for one at the entry-level digital camera price point ...  This is the second digital camera I've owned,...P>The A40 is everything I had hoped for in a digital camera: good picture quality, USB connection, and an intuitive interface.  The interface was especially good in contrast to the Olympus.  Settings for resolution and compression level are separate, which is a major feature to me.  The 3 available resolutions are 640x480, 1024x768, and 1600x1200.  The jpeg compression levels are normal, fine, and superfine.  Images at 1600x1200 and Superfine compression are quite nice indeed, with little, if any, jpeg artifacting.Focusing is done through Canon's AiAF system, which (I guess) uses artificial intelligence to help focus the lens.  If you use the LCD screen when taking your pictures, 3 boxes appear representing the focus points.  When pressing the shutter half-way, the boxes turn green representing the part of the image that will have the focus.  This is very handy as it's hard to tell what the camera is focusing on sometimes.  However, this system does get annoying at times, such as when the green boxes choose to focus on something other than what you want!  This usually requires you to make an adjustment to your angle or position.  In general I am pretty pleased with the focusing on the A40.  ...I was afraid that I was simply expecting too much for a camera at this price point, but the Canon has shown me otherwise.  Pictures with the A40 are sharpest in bright sunlight, as you would probably expect.  Focusing is not quite as good in low light situations, but the AiAF is helpful in this regard.  If none of the green boxes appear when you press the shutter button it's a sign that there's not enough light to get a good focus, and your image may come out blurry.  There's an autofocus helper beam that's supposed to help the camera focus in low light, but it's so dim that I don't see how it can really be of any assistance.  Indoors, pictures taken with the flash are pretty good, but sometimes the flash goes off outside where there is ample light, and the resulting image is quite dim.  In these situations I've found it's usually best to disable the flash, though you might end up with a somewhat blurry image.  Colors on the A40 are bright and vivid.  There are sites you can find with great sample pictures, and I would suggest everyone find some sample photos before making a decision on any digital camera.  I don't notice much, if any, bleeding of colors,...The menu system is clean and intuitive.  The font for the menus is easy to read, even in bright sunlight.  There is an on/off button which in photo mode causes the lens to extend or retract, or in \"play\" mode causes the stored images to be displayed on the LCD screen.  There's a mode wheel which allows you to select Play, Auto, Program, Manual, Panorama, and Movie mode.  The movie mode allows you to record short (~15 seconds on the included 8 meg CF card) movies.  Most digital cameras sold today have this \"Feature,\" however the Canon is unique in that it has a built-in microphone, so you get sound with your movie as well as video.  Most cameras have no mic, so you're left with video only.One thing that was somewhat disappointing with the A40 was that it wasn't recognized as a Mass Storage Device when plugged into my Windows 2000 PC, which my Olympus was.  However, this turned out to be a non-issue once I installed the A40's included software.  Once the software is installed, you plug the camera into a USB port on your PC, set the camera to \"play\" mode, and turn it on.  Canon's ZoomBrowser application then starts up, and prompts you to download all of the camera's new images (since the last time you synced, though you can set it to fetch all images, or just ones you've flagged) to your PC.  On the included 8 meg card this takes less than 30 seconds when the card is full.  Once the images have been transferred to my PC, I quit the ZoomBrowser app, so I can't really give you a decent review of the app itself.  I prefer to do photo editing in photoshop.The A40 takes 4 AA batteries, which are included.  I've had the camera for over a week and taken ~200 pictures and am still using the set of batteries that came with the camera, so I would say it has pretty good battery life.  As with any digital camera, I would recommend a set of NiMH rechargables if you're planning to use the camera with any frequency (and believe me, since you're not worrying about paying for film processing, you'll be using the camera a lot more -- I take pictures of the wall just because I *can*).As I've stated above, the A40 ships with an 8 MB Compact Flash card.  At the max resolution and best compression, this will hold only 8-12 images, so I plan on purchasing a 128 meg CF card.  ... and it will save you lots of time running back and forth to the PC to transfer images, especially if you use a lower resolution or jpeg level -- my personal favorite is 1024 Superfine.All in all, the Canon Powershot A40 is an excellent camera for the price, is more than suitable for beginners, and is even enough to satisfy a computer-geek (but photo-newbie) like me.  While you can probably get better quality by spending more, the A40 is relatively inexpensive for such a quality device.", "Date": "June 22, 2002"}, {"Title": "Very Impressive camera, great value", "Author": "CardsFan \"Steve\"", "ReviewID": "R1OK6W9TSR9O4O", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I purchased the Canon A40 about 4 days ago, and have taken a few hundred pictures with it so far.  I bought it to replace my old Sony FD-73, which was only a 0.3 megapixel camera.  I wanted better quality and more storage options (greater capacity), so I started shopping around for a good quality 2.0MP Camera on Amazon. The picture quality is excellent.  I noticed no chromatic abberation on any of the shots I took.  The pictures were crisp and clear, the colors were vibrant, and the pictures were good whether taken indoors or outdoors.  And, believe it or not, I'm still using the AA Alkaline batteries that came with the camera.  Even after several hundred pictures, they are still working.  I've read numerous reviews of cameras in this price range that drain batteries very quickly, I'm impressed that mine are still working.  I also tested the video mode of the camera.  It seems to automatically stop the video after about 10 seconds, I'm not sure if that setting can be changed.  The quality of the video was excellent and the audio quality was good, however the size of the video is something like 320x200 pixels (I don't remember precisely), which is quite small.  The 10 second video used about 3.7MB of space on the video card.  As everyone knows, the 8MB card that comes with it is useless. I threw it in the trash and bought a 256 SmartMedia card, which works great.  Based on the size of the pictures I took, full quality pictures at 1600x1200 averaged about 950K, while low quality pictures at 640x480 averaged about 145K.  Based on that, my 256MB card should hold about 270 pictures at the highest quality and 1700 pictures at the lowest quality.I played around with the \"Stitch\" mode as well, which is supposed to help you paste together pictures into a panoramic shot.  It was very helpful.  Here's how it works:  It reduces the viewscreen so you can see two shots at once.  After you take the first picture, it puts it on the left side of the LCD view screen.  When you're ready to take the 2nd picture, you can line up the shot with the previous picture, so they'll line up correctly when you paste them together with your PC graphics program.  Supposedly, the camera automatically adjusts itself in Stitch mode so that the camera uses the exact same settings to try and keep the two pictures uniform.  There seems to be no limit to how many pictures the camera will let you \"stitch\" together.The camera also offers numerous manual settings for the professional photographer.  You can manually adjust ISO speed, shutter speed, white balance, and many other features you would expect to find on a camera with a much higher price tag.In sum, I'm very impressed with this little camera, and I think it is a great value for the price.  In my opinion, 2.0MP is the perfect quality for a casual user, Cameras in this range seem to offer the best combination of value, price, and picture quality.  I highly recommend it.  Good luck finding this camera, it always seems to be sold out on Amazon.  I guess that's a good sign!", "Date": "April 22, 2002"}, {"Title": "Easy, great photos even for beginners", "Author": "L.

I also read many reviews and this camera was at the top of the list in every category including durability. I love that this camera looks and feels like a normal camera. You can use the viewfinder just like the olden days. It is larger and has the heft of a camera, not tiny like some digital cameras.Out of the box set up time was about 10 minutes. The instruction book begins at the beginning and is written in plain English with illustrations. No wonk-y mumbo-jumbo. Basically, you slap the batteries in, put the little memory card in its slot, turn it on and point and shoot. Auto focusing and flash make it SIMPLE!I was in a quandry about megapixels. I wondered if 2.1 was too low for the pics to be sharp. A couple of years ago, that was the top of the line, now, 2.1 is prehistoric. I decided to go with the A40 and 2.1 as a learning experience because the price is so low and Canons are so great. I figured after a couple of years, I'd junk the A40 and get a super megapixel camera. WRONG! This is a keeper! The photos are absolutely beautiful and crisp, even up to 8\"X10\". The color is absolutely accurate! My dad is a Nikon snob and even he admitted that my Canon A40 did a much better job than his Nikon 2.1 megapixel!You have the option of using the Auto mode, where the camera does everything but push its own button or you can use it like a conventional camera where you set the exposure, shutter speed, etc.There are a lot of other settings to play with if you want to, like  making the colors more vivid.I did invest in a 256MG memory card because I read that the 8MG one the camera comes with doesn't hold many photos. I have shot 200 photos without a glitch or erasing any to free up memory space.I think that this is the greatest value and quality in a digital camera for any level of user that anyone could want.

The A40 in the entry model in a series of sturdy digicams that offer progressively higher resolutions, but little else in terms of functionality. As I have stated in numerous reviews of other digicams, resolution much beyond 2 megapixels is worse than useless for *most* applications, it is costly. It not only costs money in the sense that it raises the initial price of the camera, but operationally, it requires greater battery use, usually involves longer lag times between shots, takes much longer to download to a PC and especially prolongs both phases of e-mailing photos (your uploading the file and your recipient opening it).

Having used it for several weeks, I had a good grasp on its functions and debated upgrading to a different camera when I went to buy again.Well I did my research and found that this camera really can't be beat. So I bought another one to replace the stolen one.First of all, it's pretty much the only one on the market that gives you nine different options for manual control. If you're an experienced photographer who enjoys manually changing lighting and apeture settings like a SLR camera, this might be the camera for you, in the price range. You can change the f-stops/apeture along with film speeds to get the right camera lighting for specialized shots. You can also shoot in sepia tone, different lighting situations from florescent light to natural outside light. And you know how you can be walking along and see a shot that is perfect for black and white? This camera will let you do that; switch over from color mode to black and white, then press a button. It's that easy. No need to take your color photos back, upload them and fiddle around with them with a software program.Of course it also has automatic functions for those not so proficient in shooting. The photos come out flawlessly in any lighting environment and has a red-eye flash reduction button for up-close portrait shots. In fact it has about four different flash settings from portrait shots, to delayed to timed to none, to red-eye. The resolution of the images is startling clear, the ability to see what you've taken immediately afterwards is a big plus. And you can adjust the time delay on image storage so that you can view it for up to 10 seconds after you've taken the picture and either keep it or immediately delete it, if it's not what you want; saving space on your memory card.I bought a 64 meg memory card with this camera and at a high  resolution that allows about 68 photos; about 110 with medium resolution (still very high quality).The camera itself is very intuitive; you'll have no problem figuring it out and shooting almost out of the box. If you have questions, the manual that comes with it pretty much explains everything you'd need to know. And Canon is known for its lens quality, so you know you're getting a good product that will carry you through any photo taking adventure.The only negative I'd say is that it's a little bulky compared to other products out there. But the heft of it is not necessarily a bad thing ... if it were lighter or smaller you'd worry about breakage, or the solidity of the mechanisms.I know there are 4.0 cameras out there now; but not with the multiple choice of function that this camera has. It has it all. And the image quality of each shot you take with this camera are startling clear, 2.0 is definately sharp, you'll probably be amazed at how clear the photos are compared to the regular 35 mm photos you've taken with your regular camera in the past. As a novice photographer it's a great camera to learn and grow with because of all its technical abilities. For an advanced photographer, I think you'll be pleasantly surprised at all its functions; enough to give you the perfect picture you're seeking.And you can't beat the price. It's a great deal.

This is why: the camera body is sturdy and it is easy to hold and shoot. It looks like a normal camera so fits in most point-and-shoot camera bags. The camera is also small enough to fit in the pocket of most cargo pants. It has many accessories available and has upgradable lenses. The camera is somewhat intuitive to use once you know what the symbols for the buttons indicate- all of them are multifunctional. The only downsides are that the knob is a little less than ergonomic and the manual is horribly organized. The camera itself is fantastic overall. It does eat batteries quickly when connected to the computer for downloading, but on the road it is very conservative (I reccommend buying the ac adapter for downloading unless you have an unlimited supply of batteries). The optical zoom flows smoothly into the digital. The software is very easy to use and you will definitely find it useful. It also comes with a lite version of Adobe- which is a great piece of software to have on it's own.What about the pictures? The pictures are fantastic! The shots are much more akin to a manual 35 mm camera than a point-and-shoot. The colors are very vivid. You'd never be able to take shots like this with a regular camera. It can take a picture in a darkened room and make it as clear as if the lights were on. All together this is a great camera and I'm glad I bought it! I highly reccommend you consider it too!(Aside, Amazon.com has better prices than ALL the retail stores, it's trustworthy and just as good as most internet stores/auctions so I suggest you buy it here.)", "Date": "October 2, 2002"}, {"Title": "Outstanding in every way", "Author": null, "ReviewID": "R3DKWW6KVDGCLZ", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I don't usually write reviews, but I am so impressed with this camera that I had to write a short one.Things I like about this camera:- can turn off in-camera sharpening. Most digicams oversharpen pictures, making them look unnatural.  The images coming out of this camera with sharpening set to low (basically off) are very 35mm-like.- manual controls.  Even though you only set the f-stop at two points--wide open (2.8 - 4.0) or fairly small (8.0 - 14.0) depending on the focal length--my photographic \"powess\" hasn't been restrained by this limitation yet.- noise reduction for exposures over 1.3 seconds (using dark frame subtraction) that works wonderfully;- ergonomic, if not easy to learn (I didn't mind reading the manual).  Most functions are accessible without going into the menus;- continuous shooting mode that could satisfy Austin Powers: fast (1.2/large - 1.5/small fps) and lets you shoot between 7 (large) and 63 (small) frames before \"..and I'm spent\";- last, but not least, great pictures overall: little CCD noise and minimal blooming -- two more things making the pictures look more like film.Things I don't like about this camera:- Uh.. hmmm...

I had narrowed the field down to the Canon and the Fuji Finepix 2600 and originally decided on the Fuji.  After taking the 2600 home for a night and messing with it a bit, I changed my mind and traded it in for the Canon.  There were several reasons...-The Canon felt much more solid.  Part of this is the weight and size, being a bit bigger and heavier that a lot of digi cameras.  It will probably not fit in your average shirt pocket, but I like to keep it in the case or my hands most of the time anyway.  The upshot of the slightly bigger size is that the camera is laid out very well.  The Fuji seemed to have appendages, because the body was so small yet the LCD and buttons kind of hung off it.  The Fuji has a sliding door that covers the lens which felt pretty flimsy, whereas the Canon automatically retracts the lens and covers it when you power off or if you are in play mode for a length of time.-The Canon had many more manual options.  Basically a full manual mode, programmed auto mode, and full auto mode.  The Fuji does not let you adjust ISO or shutter speed.-Pics taken in low light were much better from the Canon.-The LCD screen on the Canon, although a bit smaller than the Fuji, looked clearer and more true to the actual image.-The movie mode on the Canon has audio, the Fuji does not.-Finally, I just decided that I liked the Canon name better.I am very happy I made the decision to get the Canon.  I have taken about 200 pictures since I got it and have had great results.  The software that came with it is quite useful.  Zoom browser EX makes it very easy to organize and view hundreds of photos at a time and the Arcsoft camera suite, while very obviously created for the consumer market, is very capable.  Stich mode works great and is super easy to set up.  Basically the CPU does all of the work for you. My advice?  BUY THIS CAMERA.  You will not be dissapointed.

The 2 MPixel system gives nice computer jpegs and nice prints. The 4\"x6\" prints that I've made at our local Walmart look great and the colors are perfect, like professionally developed 35 mm prints. I could not tell at all that they were \"digital\". They were certainly nicer than 35mm prints developed at most \"24 hour\" shops, and cheaper as well. As an aside, I tried some 1-1.3 MPixel cameras and found that in most cases I could detect their \"blockiness\" in prints and in jpegs viewed on a computer monitor. Remember that you often need to crop and then blow up pictures for web pages and the like, and the 1 Mpixel cameras will give you problems here. 2 MPixel seems to take you just above the \"blockiness\" threshold for most jpegs unless you really have to blow them up a lot.The Canon A40 itself has many excellent features, and after taking well over a thousand shots I've not had any serious problems. I've even found that you can do things like taking a picture through a telescope, binoculars or a magnifying glass. You need a tripod and it can be tricky, but you can do it. I especially like the long time exposures you can do, and the macro mode for closeups.The software that came with the camera works just fine on my windows 2000 machine, and downloading and viewing is a breeze using the USB port. It would be helpful to have some basic photo editing software, like adobe photoshop lite or macromedia fireworks. Get two sets of NiMH batteries (one in the camera and one charged and handy for when replacement is needed). I picked up an Everyready NiMH charger and 8 NiMH batteries at (local store) for something like $30. A charged set will last for many hundreds of shots depending on how often you use the flash. I also recommend getting at least a 128 MB flash card as you'll be surprised how many pictures you take once you get one of these cameras. I found the perfect case at (local store) for about $10.The three best things about digital cameras are:1) You know exactly what you have when you shoot a photo2) You can take as many photos as you like until you get that perfect one, and then just delete the bad ones3) The fidelity is basically perfect unless you blow up prints to a large size. You don't have any devloping flaws to contend with, and once you have it in digital format, it will never deteriorate.

I used it from the Andes to Iguaz\u00fa, in cloudy, rainy, sunny weather; in freezing cold and on hot days; in the desert-like mountains and in the spray of the Iguaz\u00fa Falls.This is one rugged camera which offers great features, especially if you are used to Canon products: I had the A-1 and still use the EOS 500N and found it supremely easy to get into the groove of this camera, in fact, this very reason won me over compared to the Sony P-50 and the Olympus D-510. I won't bother you with repeating the features, you can look them up any day on the Canon website. Remember though, the video capability is nice, but you can't turn the videos 90\u00b0 - I have to watch my Iguaz\u00fa sweep with my head on my shoulders... And the artistic options like B/W or Sepia (the 1900s style) are definitely cute. Also, other than many guys on this site, I consider myself a dedicated amateur and DO use all the extras and gimmicks of this camera.Battery: As is common knowledge, plain batteries won't do it. I got the Amazon Kodak set plus the Olympus charger and batteries, and there is no problem even though theoretically you are supposed to use 1600 mAh only: these have 1700 and 1850 mAh respectively (and I'm charging the 1850 Kodaks in the 1700 Olympus charger); no sweat. The new rechargeables lasted me a day of heavy picture-taking, but they seem to last longer with time. If you use it now and then, we are talking weeks and months, it might even be smarter to use standard batteries.Lens: Just great, the optical zoom equals SLR 38-105mm, which gives you many options. Forget about the digital zoom, you can do that with software on your PC.Memory card: Obviously, the 8 MB card that comes with it is a pathetic joke, but hey, do you expect your SLR camera to come with a stash of films? For a holiday, I'd recommend two cards of 128 MBs each, this gives you about 270 pix at highest size/resolution. Remember that opposed to a conventional camera, you can sit down every night with a beer/wine/cocktail/mineral water (delete as appropriate) and delete the failed shots, so you'll need a lot less takes compared to 35mm films.Card reader: Frankly, if you're not a professional photographer or terminally ill, why bother with one? I downloaded a 128 MB card in about 10 minutes, which means 135 perfect pix or about 4 secs each, or more at lower quality. Win XP seems to be even faster. And how often do you need to download that amount?Exposure: Here's the downside - if it can be considered such at this price. The camera will always lighten up the dark spots in your picture as opposed to a SLR which will find a compromise. This resulted under hazy conditions in plain white skies. Then again, you can fix this with the exposure meter by changing it to -1 or less.If you want to see examples, check out the pix at Webshots (User: chileno66, not all are with this camera!).If in doubt, don't hesitate: This is one great camera in its range!", "Date": "September 6, 2002"}, {"Title": "This camera thoroughly impressed both me and my friends", "Author": "David Traill", "ReviewID": "R1PWUF4P3LXCEB", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I was never been a big photography buff, but this camera has made it possible for me to do more than I ever imagined, and has me thinking about where I should go next to take more pictures.

The Canon A40 was well worth the wait.  Within five minutes of opening the box, I was taking great pictures with this camera.  I wouldn't call the more complex features of the A40 intuitive, but with 3-4 hours of experimenting, I had figured out almost everything without opening the manual (although the manual is handy for picking up the details). Installation of the software on my XP system was a breeze.  I still don't have everything figured out yet, but the basics were self-explanatory without the manual.

The problem is especially bad indoors, where I miss a lot of easy shots that my point-and-shoot Fuji 35mm could handle easily.  The camera is unable to get a focus lock on anything about 10% of the time.  When it does claim that it has a lock, about 5% of the time it was actually focusing on a spot about a foot below the squares in the LCD that are supposed to show what the autofocus is locked on.  The focus difficulties were almost enough for me to give the camera 4 stars, but when you consider this rare problem against the price, the features, and all of the fantastic pictures I've taken already, it's clear that this camera deserves the highest rating.One thing that I would like to see on future generations of this camera is a 4-way thumb pad like the S330 has.

Good crisp photos- and a very good digital zoom (digital zooms do not usually work very well). Good wide angle lens for close-ups.The Cons: Not very good in low-light situations (inside tents in the evening, photos of people at dawn or dusk)  Does all right for rapid-action (sports) photos, but film is still superior for that sort of action, and sunrises and sunsets.  Sometimes the \"ON\" button needs to be pressed twice (or just hard) to turn it on.Overall, for my purposes, it is an excellent all-purpose camera, and is currently at the top of the office's list for a \"replacement\" camera if one of our other cameras fail.

It has been thousands of miles by automobile & aircraft and still takes excellent shots.There's 3 cons that keep these from being the perfect camera:1. Finger-press to shutter time is just no good for those truly candid shots. It's hard to catch people in natural states while you wait for the camera to autofocus, fire off some anti-red-eye bursts, then finally snap the scene you just missed... You become well-trained to almost prophectic-like preparedness for moments like candle-blowing or most any kid action. Adults are far more camera-aware anyway, so an SLR is still the best way to go for any action requiring fast reaction times.2. Weight. It's a mixed blessing since it comes mostly from the 4 AA batteries (ONLY USE RECHARGABLE, PEOPLE!) that allow you to go long between changes.3. Size. It's barely pocketable in loose pants. And then it pulls your pants down. You won't be hiking or even just walking around much without a good belt (or suspenders). So be prepared to carry it by hand (good for quick snapshots) and/or stowing it in a camera bag/pouch.I use a LowePro D-Res 25 AW bag which is bigger than absolutely necessary, but has MORE than enough space for a backup set of batteries & memory card, the A/V cable (in a perfect interior slot), shoulder strap, velcro belt strap, and an attached (but hidden) rain cover.

If you have good light you can take pictures that stop action in mid stream and have very accurate color.2. I mostly take pictures using the automatic mode or the program mode, which allows you to set the exposure, white balance, macro mode, etc.3. The menu is easy to learn, although you can't navigate it quickly.4. The lcd screen is clear and bright.5. You can zoom in on lcd images to see if you've taken sharp pictures.6. Using manual settings (and a tripod) you can take great indoor pictures using natural light rather than a flash.7. You can take pictures forever using NiMH rechargeables, or if you do run out of juice you can always pop in some AA's.8. The camera uses compact flash cards which are available everywhere and are relatively inexpensive.9. The optional 2.4x telephoto lens is great for macro or portrait shots. I have taken some extraordinary pictures using this lens, as long as the subject is relatively close at hand. Gives that pro look where the image is clear but the background is out of focus.Bad:1. Indoor pictures with the flash are often a disappointment, with too much red in skin tones and a yellowish tint to teeth. Very unapealing. It's hard to get that red out of the skin with Adobe Elements and still have natural looking skin tones.2. Focusing is often problematic. As there is no manual focus, you've either got to get the camera to focus on its own or you'll get a blurry image. The subject must have contrast in order for the auto focus to work. I often have to keep shifting forward and backward to get enough contrast.3. The 3x optical zoom doesn't make much of a difference beyond a dozen feet or so. I purchased the optional telephoto lens which adds 2.4x to the zoom, but this is still no big deal. You've got to get close to your subject.4. There is no bracketing feature. I never heard of this until I began learning a bit about photography. With it you can pre-set a variety of exposures and take several pictures in a burst, each with its own settings. This ensures that one of the pictures is likely to come out the way you want. Too bad the A40 doesn't have it.5. The red eye reduction mode doesn't work. Red eye is still prevalent. There is no way to add an external flash so you're stuck with red eye like it or not.6. The lcd screen is brighter than a pc monitor, or a print out of the image. Thus an image that looks properly exposed in the lcd will be underexposed if you view it on your pc or print it out. You have to adjust your expectations - if the image looks a little overexposed in the lcd it's probably just right in reality.", "Date": "July 3, 2003"}, {"Title": "Awesome camera", "Author": null, "ReviewID": "R2W7NEL8C2P8S6", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "All I can say is that this is an amazing camera.

It is a casual users camera, and as such, it does an outstanding job.  It's nice and light, but not ridiculously small.  I've had other entry level digital cameras, and the photo quality on this one is very nice.  Also, digital cameras often show a great difference between where objects lie when you look through the viewfinder, and where they end up on the photo, because of the distance between the lens and the viewer.  The Canon seems to suffer from this a bit less than I've experienced elsewhere.The use of compact flash is a big plus in my mind.  That particular storage method, according to some magazine articles I've read, is here to stay for the long haul.  Also, additional cards are inexpensive, and, of course COMPACT.  It's simply a media I like, and recommend.The camera can make very short, web-quality videos, but to be very honest, I've not really found a use for that other than as a novelty (\"hey, look what I can do with my still camera.\")  However, we have a digital camcorder as well, so that might explain it.  If, for example, you had your A40 with you, and nothing else, and something remarkable was happening, being able to use the video could be nice.  BUT, it'll use up your whole card, so make sure you have extra compact flash with you.As with ALL digital cameras, this one EATS batteries.  Take extras...and you must invest in rechargeable batteries.  They upfront cost will be made up in shockingly short time.My only complaint about the camera might seem silly to some.  It's not as SIMPLE as some other entry level cameras.  It puts a bit more control in your hands (if you want it) and this makes for a longer and more daunting manual than usual.  But don't be put off, you don't have to use the manual exposure and such.  You can just be a \"dummy\" and let the camera do it for you.  On a side note:  over the years, I seem to end up with a lot of canon products, including camcorders and printers.

The AVI it produces is a compressed avi which Premiere 6.5 won't allow me to edit with. So I use my Easy CD Creator 5 Platium and go to its edit video mode.

I took this camera to 2 trips and boy It *was* fun. I have taken over 4k shots with it, done all kind of shots, outdoor, indoor, day and night shoot, scenary, paranorma(stitch!), stationary / moving , special effect........ But most of my picture(1600x1200) are kind of burr when view @1600x1200. Disappointed quality compared to my friends canon S200, also a 2M pixel camera. At first I feel the A40 is very easy to use(of course, there is a learning curve involved.). The various settings on the camera are easy to set without going thru alot of menu(cf. olyumpus camera). The color is Excellent but a bit over saturated. I found the color is closer to the original subject if u have the 'photoeffect' set to 'neutral'. Under very favourable/strong lighting condition, the picture quality is excellent. But the subject cannot be very far away(within  a couple of feet.) or it will burr. And I have found out most of my distant shot(landscape shot with landscape mode set on A40) are kind of burr too. Sometimes, some flower marco shots(again u need to set marco mode on the camera) are out of focus. It is extremely difficult to obtain correct focus on marco/close up shots. its like a hit and miss thing. It also wont focus on RED flower. I dont know if its the Autofocus system malfunction or some other issues. I have already applied the official canon AF adjustment upgrade(BTW its not a firmware upgrade!) but cannot notice any improvement. Since I couldnt confirm the 13.6 Focal length problem as mentioned by smokingbear before the update. But I tend to agree to smokingbear that maybe the update is just a 'patch' to the F/L info and not a 'fix' to the actual focus problem.  In low light condition u definitly need to use flash to get sharp picture. And this camera will not focus in low light even u have the Canon AF-assist light turned on. And the redeye reduction flash is a joke. u will *most* likely  to get redeye if u turned it on.I like the manual function of this camera. There is alot of (read *alot*)  settings on the manual shutter control(from 15s to 1/1500). on the other hand, the manual aperture setting has much less to choose from. Another feature i like is the ability to turn off sharpening. It can be done later using photoshop, so there is no need to use the onboard sharpening for each photo.The battery life is excellent I have my lcd display on all the time. Talking about LCD, U do need a bigger monitor to check if your picture is out of focus or not. Almost all review on this camera never discuss the Auto focus issue which i find interesting. seems nobody mention canon is notorious about their AF system. If this camera had the ability to produce focus and sharp 1600x1200 picture all the time,  I will certainly vote A40 to be the best digital camera to own right now. But this camera can produce maybe just 50% good quality 1600x1200 stuff ...", "Date": "September 18, 2002"}, {"Title": "Great camera!", "Author": null, "ReviewID": "R2MYTYH056XRMG", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Having been an SLR camera buff for well over 25 yrs, it was tough for me to jump into the digital camera era.

It's easy to use, has intuitive controls and takes great photos!

Effects - Shots such as Black and White, Sepia, and built in Sharpening mode make use better than just normal photos.  Easy Use - Wheel selector on back of camera is GREAT!  Makes use a lot better than cameras where you have to select through a menu every time you turn it on.CONS:  2 MP is good for photos of just tooling around.  4 MP may be better if you want to print out digital photos (Cannon i950 photo printer is GREAT for that!!!)  Movie Mode - Takes movies which are between 12 and 24 seconds (depends on temperature, I think).  Great for taking small movies IF the events you want to film are on cue when you press the button (Real life, I have found, is not!)  If you are more into longer films, then the PowerShot S45 may be better.  I really like Point & Click photography.  Digital cameras require a bit of focusing time, which can result in a 2 or so second delay.Overall, it's a great camera.  I am upgrading to the PowerShot S45 because of the longer movie mode and the 4 MP.  2MP is fine for home, but I use it at work also, and find myself needing more detail.This camera is great for the price.

You can adjust the shutter speed from as slow as 15 seconds to as fast as 1/1500 of a second. I guess that takes you beyond the amature to a creative level. You can also take pictures in low lights where other cameras cannot. The most amazing thing about this camera, which was mostly the main reason I bought it for, is the expandability. You can attach a variety of extra lenses, such as wide-angle converter, tele-converter for extra zoom, and macro-converter lense for close-up distance, which extend the limit of this camera.

The optical zoom is satisfactory and we've not needed the additional (lower-quality) digital zoom yet. At the largest size, 1600x1200, the photos are easy to crop and suitable for printing using our inkjet all the way up to 8x10 resolution. Pictures are sharp (I'd skipped the Kodak cameras after reading their picture quality was only so-so) and colors are exactly what we see. The 10-sec high-quality movie mode (30-sec low quality) is a fun addition which we've used several times when a camcorder wasn't handy or justified.The LCD screen is large enough to do its job, the photo browser is easy to use, and the buttons are easy to get to. We replaced the included 8MB CF card with a 64MB card, which is sufficient, although there are a couple times we wish we had a 128MB card instead.

Installing the software on the Windows PCs was a bit trying, but once it's there the camera integration works wonderfully. Both Mac and Windows users will be very satisfied.Most of the time the camera is used in or around our home to take family photos, so two sets of batteries and 64MB of digital film is sufficient, but those who are often out and about should consider a third set of batteries and 128MB or more of memory.

A40 delivers fine quality images and just the design and handling of the camera makes it so comfortable to hold and take pictures.

I've used it for taking small video shots also in AVI format and the included AV cable comes handy. I could then convert my AVIs into MPEG and burn them onto VCD for viewing pleasure on TV along with the slide shows.All in all, a great camera for the price and delivers good quality sharp pictures deom an impressive device.", "Date": "May 30, 2002"}, {"Title": "Awesome!!!!", "Author": "Garett Fay", "ReviewID": "R1182JA0CGFSTG", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I could tell you a bunch of details...but, I will make it simple, This camera is easy to use and takes Great pictures.

It seems to use power better than other cameras I've used; I can go several days without recharging or replacing my batteries (Ialways carry a spare, fully charged set).

I was not sure if it would be a good one or not as there were no reviews about it. It was a tough decision.BTW: this is my first digital camera. And i doubt I could have opted for a better one. Its a perfect balance between price and features. Infact, you can classify this camera as the best value for your money. If you are one of the people who just clicks for fun and is not into professional photography, this camera is awesome. 2MP is definitely not less in this case.I have never really used the manual controls, but its definitely there for me to use some day. currently i am simply more than happy with the automatic controls and do not wanna tinker with the camera manually. The movie mode is pretty useful @ times as well, although its not utilized to its full capacity.I also purchased a 128MB compact flash card, and that i should say is a must. The prices for those have dropped drastically as well. If u search hard for it, u can get one for as low as [money], which is a steal. its wise to buy this as u will realize that 8MB is not enough by any standards.Do yourself a favor and buy this camera.

Well I should have taken these reviews more seriously.I bought the Fuji 2800 camera to replace my old trusted Kodak 240 digital camera. I wanted better zoom and a newer camera with the cool new features.What I got was a camera that did not take low light pictures very well at all and many of my pictures were out of focus. You might say, well I can live with the low light, I COULD NOT! I need a camera that produces quality pictures regardless of light. And my pictures were fuzzy. NOT good Fuji! Did you rush this one out the door or what.After calling Fuji's Customer service they told me that I had a defective product and to return it.(Being in denial I thought, maybe I was doing something wrong, because this camera had the zoom I really wanted.) I did not really want to look at another Fuji after that dissappointing ordeal.I got back on the Net and this time I noticed the Canon PowerShot A40. (It has 3x optical and 2.5 digital zoom, not the greatest, but decent). I really liked its reviews and decided I could live with the difficult manual and operation until I learned the camera if it meant I would be getting a good camera. PLUS, this camera has \"MOVIE capabilty, Sound and 4 different picture modes. I went into ... and they demo'ed it for me and even printed off pictures for me. I had them set it for me for an event this evening and I was able to use it right out of the box, tonight I'm learning the ins and outs. I LOVE THIS CAMERA! It is so cool being able to get a 30 second video on my camera without tugging along my hefty camcorder. It really is great for short movie clips. I plan to email them to friends tomorrow.And the picture quality is excellent, when I took my pictures earlier today I did not like the way a couple of them came out so I called ...and they told me I could adjust the color by adjusting the setting (choice of lighting about 6 settings from cloudy, flouresent, etc), worked like a charm. And the prints are just awesome.What I learned: Listen to the negative comments from owners, they can be right. Then ask yourself, if your camera turns out to have those problem, can you live with it and be satisfied?More importantly, go to a camera store to demo and buy a camera! I had never did this before because I felt they would be more expensive based on the expensive models I saw in Sunday's papers, my camera cost $..., which is about what I can get it off the Net. BUT, in the store (given you have a knowledgable sales person helping you), you can get quick information and demo's to help you make your decision. And getting the pictures printed off in ... was just too sweet! BTW; if you do this and your prints do not come out right, the store model settings have probably been played with by shoppers like you and me -lol. So its great to have someone there who KNOWS camera's and is not just SELLING them!Regardless to what you get, be flexible and be ready to quickly return the camera if you are not satisfied to find what you really want!
