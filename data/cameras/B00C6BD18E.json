Worked as I had hoped and obtained spectacularly sharp photos of animals from both closeup and long distances.", "Date": "March 2, 2014"}, {"Title": "Sony Digital Camera", "Author": "ADVENTURERS2 \"anuenue\"", "ReviewID": "RK60M9LDDLZOB", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Love this camera. Easy to use. The 500x zoom is wonderful. I can get clear shots with full zoom without a tripod. The additional accessories I received with the camera, at no extra cost from the seller, are great. I would have paid much more for just the filter lenses and the additional battery. Compared to my Sony video camera, this camera batteries runs out quickly. But, with the additional battery, I can get a lot of photos and video. The thing I like best about the camera are the many options. On \"Landscape with distant focus,\" I can get a shot with nothing else impairing the focus. We travel in a motorhome and I take many pictures through a windshield. Nothing on the windshield blurs my shot. I'm very impressed with this Sony digital camera.", "Date": "January 10, 2014"}, {"Title": "Sony HX300 digital camera", "Author": "VictoryTC \"Butch\"", "ReviewID": "RH9N38EIPEAI0", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This is a great camera for the money.  Better than other similar cameras at the $500 price point.  Tremendous versatility for all shooting opportunities.  The rapid fire function is faster than my Nikon D-10.  I've only had this camera a couple of weeks but I love the versatility and quality of photos so far.", "Date": "September 5, 2013"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": null, "Features": null, "Name": null, "ImgURL": null, "ProductID": "B00C6BD18E"}}
