Klecker \"el n00bo loco\"", "ReviewID": "R3IIKFGQCVGFA2", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I am a mid-20's tech-geek, that happens to work in private security.  I do a lot of camera work, so my expectations are always high.  Our neighborhood has had a lot of break ins, so this system has a purpose...to make sure I put the guy behind bars.  This camera was very easy to install, and the brackets went on very secure.  I also purchased an Aposonic DVR card for a dedicated PC with 500gb's of storage, so keep in mind that when I refer to video quality it is describing the video after being converted to digital.  So far I have been recording 4 shots, at 640x480 @ 100% quality and in a week have only used 4% of my storage capacity.The housing design is very slick, and is by no means an \"eye sore.\"The IR lights are powerful enough to view the immediate area of the camera, but the quality deteriorates at about 30 ft.  The iris adjusts very quickly if any light sources enter the shot (ie: headlights).  I purchased 5 of these cameras, all for outdoor use (however I only used 4...I ruined one, which I will explain later).  This camera does capture a wide angle, so I probably could have covered my entire house/yard using 2-3.Pros-Crisp, clear shot during the day.  Adequate shots in the night.-Very solid, great quality-Great design, which is also very functional-Great Autofocus, Iris, and Color.Cons-The factory cable is built in, and cannot be replaced if ruined (that's how I ruined a camera)-Wires are accessible when camera is positioned at certain angles.-Very fast movement (such as wind blowing) makes the camera appear very pixelated.Overall recommendation:A+ This product is great for home security, or to cover large areas. If this is to catch shoplifters, you may want to go with something that gets you a closer shot.Side Note:This camera does not include a power supply, so make sure you purchase one.  Also, be careful when loosening the enclosure as I stripped the security screw....and I had to drill it out.", "Date": "October 29, 2008"}, {"Title": "Audio Mic - just thrown in box - Not integral to camera.", "Author": "Mike the K", "ReviewID": "R1N3E6PXGGM8D7", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "The \"microphone\" model is just the standard camera with a seperate external microphone add-on: it looks like a 12inch siamese cable (but it's 3-way:power-in, power-out, audio-out) with a tiny mic wraped in tape. The \"microphone\" is just thrown in the box of their standard model. Over the last six months I've bought 6 dome cameras from warehouserseller: two 420 line with power supply; two, of the \"microphone\" and two of the 480 line models (power supply extra).  The manufacturer's spec sheet is the same for ALL cameras that I received.  The camera housing varies a little (pull-apart or twist (or screw) off).  As to the Videosecu label and serial, most the cameras I ordered didn't not have it, but Jenny who answers the phone (and does tech support) swears everything is good. OK, the cameras work fine.  The 480 line camera had a sticker on the outside of the box, but inside the box the manufacture's spec sheet says that its a 420 line camera.I like the camera (all cameras I orderd appeard to have the same resolution) and warehouseseller ships quickly.I recommend ONLY the standard model ($65.00) that comes with the power supply, because that's what you'll probably get anyway.These dome cameras are fish-eye wide-angle: good as a front-door cam, back or front-yard cam.  For a driveway get the swann Bulldog (bullit type) cam.  To keep an eye on my car in the street, I use the swann.Mike the K", "Date": "July 14, 2010"}, {"Title": "Great camera.", "Author": "replayreb", "ReviewID": "R1GBUQG6XC9132", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Very sharp picture day and night that smoked the two other $220 cameras I bought.

There is no model/serial number manufacture or brand name anywhere on the unit.
