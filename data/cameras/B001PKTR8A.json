When I buy something I like to know all the features available. This camera explains all the features when you turn the wheel on the camera. It tells you what features are best for what you a taking a picture of.My husband was throwing my son in the air and this camera caught a perfect picture of them. It was not blurred at all.I am very excited to try the other features on the camera. It is a huge step up for me from my Kodak 4.0 megapixal camera.", "Date": "March 15, 2009"}, {"Title": "A Camera With a Common Defect: Frozen Lens", "Author": "Geospear-it \"iiluvinoven\"", "ReviewID": "REVGLZLGZC9MO", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "First, we have a fellow Amazon customer who bought two SL202s, and both stopped functioning within a month; the issue? Frozen lens.

I can only review pic on memory card  By marielyouzta on Nov 02, 2009  The lens is still open, Whole camera is off, How can I take a picture now? Iv'e turned if on and of several  of times.  By hhuntsman959 on Oct 29, 2009  My samsung camera will not turn on. The lens is extended. When I push the power button the blue light comes  on, camera beeps, then light goes of. If i push the picture button a picture will come on for 3 seconds  then beeps and goes off.  By dave639 on Sep 06, 2009  When I press the power button it lights up, makes a loud beep and turns off again. Nothing comes on the screen.  When I press the display button, a stored image shows for a moment and then it makes the loud beep and turns  off. The lens will not retract.  By stingraye on Nov 14, 2009  the lens is stuck. it will not go in. also nothing is showing up on the display screen.Oh, and there's a guy on Ebay trying to pawn off his SL202 with stuck lens for it's repair parts value, which he apparently thinks is 40$.  Last updated on 01:37:07 PM PDT, Oct 22, 2009: [...]Frozen lens happened to them, it happened to me, and it could happen to you. I guess the take-away point here is not to buy an SL202; I won't be buying any kind of Samsung camera ever again...stuck lens seems like somewhat of a common problem with digital cams, but it seems like a much bigger issue with the SL202; it wasn't released too long ago, and there are so many people with the same problem over the past couple of months.", "Date": "November 19, 2009"}, {"Title": "Great Value", "Author": "B.

I've had several Sony cameras and just couldn't afford the Sony I wanted.  This camera is better than the Sonys that I have owned.  I LOVE this camera, how it takes pictures.

He loves it.  It was easy to learn use and takes great pictures.  It even does well in low light situations.  Its compact size makes it possible for him to carry it everywhere, and he does.  One drawback is that it did not come with memory. You have to remember to buy a memory card.  4GB is good. I paired this camera  with a Square trade warranty, but it is very sturdy.  We have not had to try it out.

It's a convenient feature however when the camera is in very tight spaces like a pants pocket it'll turn on unoticed, and end up wasting the li-ion's battery power for any further shots.Recommended products for this camera:Gorilla podScreen protector for LCD.There was only one time  I have encountered  the stuck retractable lens issue.Out in the urban field I dropped my camera on the cement while on video record modeit beeped and then shut down. the lens was sure stuck, but after 15 minutes I slammed the retractable lens the opposite way in which it went back to working properly.", "Date": "May 5, 2011"}, {"Title": "Good", "Author": "Yolanda Canales \"Canales\"", "ReviewID": "R3TJXD59CDOW8C", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Very nice camera for a young person, still like the Canon SD750 a lot more though", "Date": "July 4, 2010"}, {"Title": "Awesome Camera", "Author": "jolene rafferty", "ReviewID": "R1I5AQBWZ1QFTR", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I got this camera for Christmas and i love it.
