{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Review Written for Beginner Photographers", "Author": "jpullos", "ReviewID": "R1KCF39XVQCDBJ", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I am a photography teacher in NYC and online. (See my Amazon profile for my website.) I teach beginner and intermediate photography students every week. I've also been a professional photographer for the last five years with images published in The New York Times, GQ, New York Magazine, Women's Wear Daily, The New York Observer, The Village Voice and Time Out New York.(This review is for beginner photographers.)If you're a beginner, you're most likely asking yourself: Nikon or Canon? Really, I feel confident in saying that you can't go wrong with either. I've used both brand's cameras extensively and find that they both offer amazing image quality with well-built, solid cameras that, if taken care of, will last decades. There are two differences between the cameras, though, that can be taken into consideration.The user-interface: If cameras were computers, Nikons would be PCs and Canons would be MACs. PCs are built for people not afraid of technology whereas Macs are built for people who want things super-easy. Nikons excel at customization options which means you'll see so many more options with the Advanced features of a Nikon than you will with a Canon. Canons, on the other hand, excel at ease-of-use for beginners. Canons offer less advanced options and can be easier to learn on. This can be frustrating down the line, though, once you've learned a lot about photography. At that point you may want all of the options that Nikon offers and be frustrated with your Canon. If you're someone who really likes to delve deep into your hobbies or if you're intent on becoming a professional photographer, I'd say a Nikon would be your best bet. If you're someone who wants to learn the basics of photography and only imagine yourself being a hobbyist, Canon would be a better option for you.Where Nikon excels: Flash photography. I often find myself in situations where I'm shooting event photography (weddings, movie premiers, benefits and galas) where I need to use a lot of flash. For this kind of photography, I'll always prefer to be shooting with a Nikon. Nikon's flash metering (how the camera magically decides how much light to fire out of the flash) is much more consistent than Canon's. You can take a Canon and shoot the same scene three times in a row with flash and all three images will be at different brightness levels. You can do the same thing with a Nikon and all three images will be wonderfully the same. If you're somebody who plans on shooting a lot with flash (indoor photography, event photography, etc.) you'll want to consider going with Nikon.Where Canon excels: Richness of colors. I've been in numerous situations where I've been on the red carpet taking the exact same picture as the photographer next to me. I'll have a Canon and the person next to me will have a Nikon. This has provided quite a few opportunities to compare the images side-by-side. What I've found is that the colors on the Canon's images look richer and make the image pop more. If I'm doing fine art photography (anything I'd like to someday hang in a gallery), I'll always want to be shooting with a Canon for this reason.If you're set on Nikon, there are three cameras you should be considering and it all comes down to what your budget is:D7000 $1,400 without lensD5100 $750 without lensD3100 $600 only available with lens(current prices as of 2/19/11)Here's what you get for spending extra money (each camera compared to the one below it):D3100 vs. D5100:The D3100 is an EXCELLENT camera so if you only have $550 to spend total on camera and lens then go out and buy this camera. You won't regret it. If you're considering spending more money, here's what you'll get from the D5100 in comparison:-Better performance in low light situations.-A higher resolution screen on the back of the camera so you can see your images more clearly and make out if they actually turned out well.-An external mic jack. (If you're planning on shooting video with an external mic, you'll want the D5100 over the D3100.)-A flip out screen (handy if you want to put your camera anywhere but at your eye level and be able to see what your camera is about to capture before you shoot it)-Faster continuous shooting. If you're often shooting sports or any fast moving subject, continuous shooting allows you to capture multiple images in a single second. The D3100 shoots at three frames per second whereas the D5100 shoots at four frames per second.-Higher ISO options. The D5100 offers one more stop of ISO than the D3100 does. If you don't know what ISO means (or what a stop is) just know that this allows you to more easily shoot images in low-light situations.-Longer battery life. The D5100's battery will last 20% longer than the D3100The two advantages of the D3100 over the D5100 are: less expensive and less weight. Whenever a camera is less expensive, it means you'll have more in your budget for the lens. The D3100 weighs 10% lighter and is 10% smaller than the D5100.D5100 vs. D7000:The D5100 is Nikon's latest and greatest and is even newer than the D7000. Phenomenal camera! If you're stuck, though, between the D5100 and the D7000, here's what you'll get by spending more money on the D7000:-More focus points. When using auto-focus, the D7000 will have an easier time focusing on what you want it to focus on.-60% longer lasting batteries.-Faster continuous shooting. If you're often shooting sports or any fast moving subject, continuous shooting allows you to capture multiple images in a single second. The D5100 shoots at four frames per second whereas the D7000 shoots at six frames per second.-Weather sealed. This means you can shoot with the D7000 in the rain.-Two memory card slots. This is really a cool feature. The D7000 has two memory card slots which means you'll be less likely to find yourself standing in front of a gorgeous scene with no more memory left.-Faster shutter speed. The fastest shutter speed on the D5100 is 1/4000th of a second; on the D7000: 1/8000th of a second. To be honest, I can't think of any practical reason why this would benefit you unless you're planning on shooting some really bright scenes like directly into the sun.Advantages of the D5100 over the D7000:-A flip out screen (handy if you want to put your camera anywhere but at your eye level and be able to see what your camera is about to capture before you shoot it)-Smaller and lighter: The D5100 is 10% smaller and 30% lighter than the D7000. This is something to consider if you plan on carrying your camera around with you a lot.-Less expensive so you can spend more on your lens!If I can clarify any of this, please email me!-JP Pullos, photography teacher, NYC and online (see my Amazon profile for my website)", "Date": "October 12, 2011"}, {"Title": "outstanding \"prothusiast\" D-SLR, solid upgrade from my D5000", "Author": "Paul Christensen \"gadget geek\"", "ReviewID": "R3RXULR8A4H60T", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "As a long-time owner of the Nikon D5000, and former owner of the Nikon D60, I was eager to purchase the D5100 after seeing the announcements and pre-reviews. Being one of the lucky ones to buy the D5100 with 18-55VR kit earlier this week, I've had a few days to play with this camera and can honestly say it's a solid upgrade to the D5000 I'm replacing, and should be on the short list of consideration for any \"prosumer\" looking to purchase a D-SLR with outstanding image quality, performance, and low-light capability in a lightweight, compact (for an SLR) body. And, unlike the D5000, this D-SLR finally has a usable Live View and HD video capabilities both with continuous autofocus.First of all, it's important to understand where the D5100 fits in Nikon's capabilities. It is considered a \"high-end enthusiast\" D-SLR which means that it shares the same image sensor as the high-end D7000 without some of the higher-end features. If you're like me, very few of the D7000's features justify its extra cost and weight. The D5100 offers nearly the same image quality as its bigger brother in a less-expensive, smaller package, while adding a few tricks the D7000 doesn't have including an articulating display that helps you frame hard-to-reach spots.Compared to its lesser-priced but still excellent brother the D3100, the D5100 offers improved image quality, speed, and resolution, along with a higher-resolution articulating display. For me, this is the sweet spot in Nikon's consumer D-SLR offerings.The 18-55VR (3x) f3.5-f5.6  kit lens provides surprisingly good performance and image quality, although you'll likely outgrow it quickly. I have uploaded a few sample images taken with the D5100 and 18-55VR to show its performance and surprisingly good bokeh (pattern of blurred background) in large-aperture and macro shots.For lens upgrades that include an AF-S autofocus motor, if you don't mind changing lenses, the Nikon 55-200VR is an outstanding value with excellent image quality, or consider the Nikon 18-105VR (5.8x) lens included with the D7000. If you don't mind some distortion and image softness, the 18-200 VRII (18x) lens may be your perfect \"walkabout\" lens. For me, I bought the pricey but outstanding Nikon 16-85mm VRII. Don't forget the Nikon AF-S 35mm f1.8 (if you can find it).Low-light performance is outstanding with this camera, and the level of detail captured by the D5100 is excellent, even at higher ISOs. You're best capturing in RAW or RAW+JPEG mode (three different JPEG compression levels are offered) if you need to go back and fine-tune exposure or other settings after the shot. Nikon also offers \"Active D-Lighting\" which is a highly effective method for improving dynamic range of a photo to equalize the difference between high and low-light areas of a photo.Interestingly, the improvement in image quality compared to my D5000 isn't dramatic. Given the incredible improvement I saw when upgrading from my Nikon D60 to the D5000 perhaps I had unrealistic expectations for this new sensor. But in most image settings, even low light, the improvement is noticeable but subtle. That speaks more for the outstanding quality and low-light sensitivity of the D5000 sensor (which is shared with the D90) than it speaks against the D5100. With the D5100 you get higher resolution for improved cropping, and the 14-bit RAW images offer greater dynamic range for more flexibility after the shot is taken.Speaking of RAW format, as with any new camera, there is a bit of a wait until updates are available for your favorite camera software. As of May 18th, Adobe, Apple, and Nikon have added support for the D5100 RAW files, so you can use Aperture, iPhoto, Nikon View NX2 (v2.1.1 and later), Nikon Capture NX2 (v2.2.7 and later), Lightroom 3 or Photoshop CS5 (via Adobe Camera RAW 6.4 or later). If you use other photo software or another platform, you may want to verify RAW support for the D5100.Compared to my D5000, Nikon has gone back and addressed most of my concerns on ergonomics and performance:- camera body is roughly 10% smaller and 10% lighter- 16.2 megapixel CMOS DX-format image sensor (shared with D7000) captures 14-bit RAW images and offers +1fs greater low-light sensitivity- ISO 100-6400 range with expansion to 25,600 ISO (D5000 minimum is 200 and expansion to 12,300)- high resolution (920k pixel) display for greater detail in image previews (although I had to bump up the default brightness one notch for accuracy)- side-mounted articulating display no longer interferes with tripod (the D5000 display is inconveniently hinged at the bottom)- dramatically improved (now usable!) LiveView mode with continuous autofocus even in HD video mode (more on that later)- full HD 1080p movie capture without the \"jelly effect\" (unless you move VERY quickly from side-to-side), in more standard H.264 mode up to 22 min (D5000 is AVI format 720p up to 5min)- slightly better control position (LiveView is now a rocker switch on the mode dial, Video Record is just behind and to the left of the shutter release)- significantly quieter shutter release (plus, a \"Quiet Mode\" is available although hardly necessary)- faster performance (4 frames per second)- SDXC compliant supports higher capacity cards- remote control sensor on rear now in addition to front-mounted sensor- improved battery life, and an improved battery release- battery charger now has built-in collapsable plug instead of requiring separate power cord- MUCH better eyecap design no longer comes off in my small Nikon camera bag; also an improved diopter (eyeglass) control- additional in-camera editing capabilities, including ability to trim video- new \"gimmick\" special effects: in-camera HDR, selective color, night vision, etcLet's start with the display - moving the hinge to the side not only makes the articulating display usable with a tripod, it makes the camera body shorter, so that it matches the height of most popular Nikon DX-format lenses and no longer leans forward when set down on a table as the D5000 did. It makes a surprising improvement in shooting comfort also. Nikon has improved the rubberized grip of the body and the thumb rest in the rear, although some have said that the grip is a bit shallow for larger hands. For my average-sized hands it is very comfortable.The improved control placement is mostly welcome as well. LiveView is now a spring-release rocker on the side of the Mode Dial (VERY handy) and the video record button is also now on the top of the body, in front of the mode dial and behind the shutter release. What I didn't care for is the placement of the rear camera buttons, which now all shift above and to the right of the display to accommodate the left-mount hinge. What I don't like is that the \"i\" button (used to display and change shooting info) is too far away from the 4-way mode switch, so changing default shooting settings is a bit more of a stretch on my thumb. On playback, the delete button is just to the right of the Zoom buttons, instead of being far away like it should be. I didn't find myself accidentally deleting photos, but I'd rather have had a button closer by that I use more frequently (like the Menu button?) With these two buttons near each other, I always found myself accidentally hitting the \"I\" button instead of RECORD to capture video. So watch your screen and make sure you actually are recording when you think you are!What has dramatically improved from the D5000 is LiveView performance and HD video capture. Neither are perfect, but compared to my D5000 both are quite usable in the D5100. In LiveView mode, the D5100 tracks faces and subjects quickly and accurately, although still nowhere near fast enough for sports events or that \"quick shot\" like you might be used to with a compact camera. On my D5100, LiveView autofocus typically took half a second in lower-light conditions, which is no match for the viewfinder, but a huge improvement from the D5000.Video capture is another notable improvement in the D5100, capturing single videos up to 22 minutes of 1080p HD (if you have the SD card capacity), in H.264 format, with continuous autofocus. Nearly gone is the \"jelly effect\" of the D5000 when you panned horizontally and the video appeared to bend. Compared to video captured on the D5000 which almost always exhibited this \"jelly effect\", I have seen none of these artifacts except in the most extreme fast horizontal pans.  In theory, the continuous autofocus sounds like a great improvement for video capture, but in practice I found it slow to react (especially in low-light situations). Too often I found the camera \"searching\" for the correct focus, even with the (optional) Nikon 35mm F1.8 AF-S lens. It was so distracting that I ended up disabling autofocus and learning how to manually adjust focus as I moved from subject to subject. Also disappointing is that like the D5000, the built-in microphone is monoral. For stereo sound, I highly recommend the Nikon ME-1 external microphone (which doesn't require batteries and mounts in the hot shoe). Overall, the video capabilities are promising, especially at 1080p, but I am more satisfied with the native 720pHD stereo video captured from my Canon S95.Rounding out the list of improvements and new features of the D5100 are the new \"special effects\", including the first in-camera HDR mode for any Nikon D-SLR. In practice, while there may be edge cases for these effects, I am not particularly impressed with any of them, including HDR. First of all, you cannot capture RAW with any of the effects. For HDR, there are further limitations (can only be used in P-S-A-M modes, not auto, no flash, etc). When you can get HDR mode to work, it can only be enabled one shot at a time, and then you have to go back to the menus to turn it on. Luckily, you can assign HDR mode to the Fn menu button. HDR mode takes two quick shots for each shutter press and then combines them in-camera to create a single JPEG. You can specify the exposure difference (Auto, 1EV, 2EV, 3EV) and level of \"smoothing\" (Low, Normal, High) between the captured images. I took a number of high-contrast shots with HDR enabled and honestly couldn't see a difference, although I'm still going to try. If there is any good news, it's that Nikon has chosen a fairly conservative / realistic HDR algorithm as opposed to an \"eye-popping\" but over-processed result.In summary, I'm quite happy with the D5100. It provides the optimal balance of top image quality (even in low light), lightweight and compact (for a D-SLR) body, articulating display (the only D-SLR from Nikon to have this), and HD video (not perfect) that can leverage the outstanding collection of Nikon lenses (understanding that only AF-S lenses will autofocus).Notable comparison with the higher-end D7000:- same 16.2megapixel image sensor with 14-bit RAW image capture for outstanding dynamic range, low-light performance, and detail- ruggedized plastic body lacks weather seal (it's also smaller and lighter weight)- no builtin focus motor for older lenses (you'll need to buy an AF-S lens if you want autofocus)- fewer autofocus zones (11 vs 39) and lower-resolution matrix meter- pentamirror viewfinder (smaller, not as bright, 95% coverage) vs pentaprism viewfinder (100% coverage)- no flash commander mode (unless you buy an external flash with TTL triggering)- slower continuous performance (4 vs 6fps)- 1 SD card slot instead of 2- no top-mounted LCD display- fewer dedicated controls for advanced settings (you must use the menu system more frequently)Notable comparison with the lower-end D3100:- higher resolution 16.2megapixel sensor with 14-bit depth- high resolution (920k pixel vs 230k) display, articulating for hard- to-view shots- higher low-light sensitivity- faster performance (4fps vs 3fps)- better battery performance (660 vs 550 images on the same EN-EL14 battery- slightly larger and heavier body", "Date": "April 22, 2011"}, {"Title": "Nikon D7000 Sensor for $400 cheaper", "Author": "shuTTL3bus \"shuTTL3bus @gmail .com\"", "ReviewID": "R31JMOUNJOMVZN", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This is a fantastic new offering from Nikon.  You get most of the best parts of the D7000 for 1/3 cheaper.  If you are looking for a starter camera or a back up body to the D7000 this is it.Here are the major differences between the D5100 and D7000.D5100Exact same sensor and processing abilities as the D7000.  Some of the best Image Quality available in any DSLR.  ISO 3200 is very usable with low noise.- Swivel screen while the D7000 is fixed -- Since the contrast autofocus (ie Live View) is not very good on either of these cameras this is not really a player unless you are using a tripod.  Then the swivel screen is very useful.- 4 fps vs 6 fps for D7000 - No big deal 4 fps is plenty fast to fill your card with similar looking pictures.  Also, in RAW D7000 buffers out pretty fast and then slows down anyway.- 11 focus points vs 39 for D7000 - Most of the time not really a big deal.  Sometimes all those extra points get in the way and slow you down.No internal auto focus motor while the D7000 has one -- If you don't have any D series or older lenses this is not an issue.  If you do, they will not autofocus on this camera.- Only one SD slot vs 2 for the D7000 -- A big difference when getting paid to shoot.  Otherwise, always format your cards in your camera and not on the computer.  Doing that I have never had a failure. (Jinxed myself now)Not weather sealed vs D7000 partially weather sealed - Don't drop either one in the water and keep both out of dust.- Has less external switches than the D7000 - This means you need to go to the menus more often which slows things down.  This can be severely annoying or not depending on your shooting style.  The D7000 handles better but this is not a deal breaker on the D5100.Built in flash is not a commander for Nikon Creative Light System while D7000 is -- If you don't use off camera flash or you use radio triggers this is not a big deal.1.2 lbs vs 1.7 lbs for D7000.Overall the D5100 is a great camera.  The D7000 have some extra features that make it worth the extra money but if you don't need them you get all the fantastic D7000 IQ for 2/3rd the price.", "Date": "May 23, 2011"}, {"Title": "Deciding Between the Nikon D5100, D7000, D3100, and D90", "Author": "dojoklo", "ReviewID": "R3VZ0I1WC1J9JF", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "The Nikon D5100 brings the high quality 16.2 megapixel sensor, great low-light performance, and full HD video capability with all the frame rate options from the popular pro-sumer D7000 to the enthusiast level model - and then includes a fully adjustable side-mounted rotating screen to boot.  The D5100 should prove to be an excellent option for new dSLR users plus those experienced enthusiasts wishing to upgrade their D50, D60, or even their D3000 to gain additional megapixels, shooting and processing speed, video, and an improved rear LCD screen.  The variety of features and functions offered on the various Nikon dSLR cameras might make it difficult to choose between them, but there are some important differences.The new Nikon D5100 sits just above the D3100, a bit below the aging D90, and several steps below the fully-featured and highly customizable Nikon D7000. The D5100 boasts a 16 megapixel image sensor (just like the D7000), shoots 4 frames per second in continuous mode, has HD video capability at 24, 25, and 30 fps, and includes the fully rotating rear LCD screen improved in flexibility from the screen of the D5000.Generally as the cameras increase in price and capability from the entry level model to the enthusiast pro-sumer model they gain more sophisticated autofocus and exposure metering systems, shoot faster (more frames per second) in continuous shooting mode, have more controls and buttons for changing settings on the camera body, and offer more menu and custom function options.Sensor and Image Quality: The sensors of the D5100 and D7000 are greatly improved over the older D90 in a couple of ways. The D5100 and D7000 have 16.2 megapixel sensors, where the D90 has 12.3 megapixels. The relatively new D3100 has a 14.2 MP sensor. This increase in resolution allows for more intrusive editing of the files in Photoshop, the ability to crop a picture and still obtain an image with high enough resolution for printing or display, and allows for larger prints. In addition, the improved sensor results in better performance at high ISO settings and in low light, better dynamic range, tonal range, and color sensitivity. Have a look at the dxomark website to compare the sensors.Exposure Metering: The D5100, while sharing a similar sensor to the D7000, does not have the same advanced metering system. It shares the less sophisticated 420 pixel RGB metering sensor of the D3100 and offers matrix metering, non-adjustable center-weighted, and spot metering modes. This system may be more than sufficient for many users, especially those not intending to adjust their exposure settings and dig into their menus in reaction to complex lighting situations. But if your shooting demands require more precise exposure metering and control over the size of the areas being metered, you need to consider the D7000 or D90. The 2016 pixel RGB metering sensor of the D7000 is also improved compared to the D90, and will result in more accurate metering performance of straightforward and complex lighting scenes and situations. Both these cameras offer matrix metering, center-weighted, and spot metering modes. With center-weighted metering on the D90, you can select the size of the center-weighted area to be a 6, 8, or 10mm center circle, and the D7000 adds a 13mm circle option.Autofocus: The autofocus systems of the D3100, D5100, and D90 all have 11 autofocus (AF) points with the center one being a more accurate cross-type. These AF systems may be more than sufficient for most users, and they can successfully track moving objects in the frame such as athletes, performers, or animals. However, if you specialize in sports, action, wildlife, or bird photography, you are going to want to consider the much more sophisticated, accurate, and customizable AF system of the D7000. The D7000 boasts a significantly improved AF system of 39 AF points with 9 of them being cross type. The AF system of the D7000 allows for you to use these points in various ways including automatic AF point selection, single point AF, and dynamic area AF using your choice of 9 points, 21 points, all points, or all points with 3D-tracking. It is important to note that the D5100 and D3100 do not have an autofocusing motor built into the body so you have to be sure to purchase lenses with built-in AF motors.  For example, the Nikon \"Nifty 50\" 50mm f/1.8 will not autofocus with these cameras.  The D7000 and D90 have the built-in motor.Body, Construction and Size/ Weight: The D5100 is just slightly larger and a tiny bit heavier than the D3100, both weighing just over one pound. Both have plastic bodies and more limited buttons and controls that the higher end models. Many users should find its size and weight great for using and carrying around, though some prefer the ergonomics of a larger body.  The D90 and D7000 appear very similar at first glance, but the plastic body of the D90 has been upgraded to the partially magnesium alloy body (top and rear) of the D7000. This adds slightly to the weight: 1.5 lbs for the D90 vs. 1.7 lbs for the D7000. The D7000 also has weather sealing at the memory card and battery doors, which the D5100 and D3100 do not. The higher end D7000 and D90 include not only the 3\" rear LCD screen but also a top LCD panel for viewing and changing your settings. This is essential for photographers who are constantly changing their settings to deal with various shooting situations.  For most users, including even those using the camera daily or in travel situations, the non-magnesium construction of the D5100 should be far more than good enough, strong enough, and durable enough.ISO: As mentioned in the Sensor and Image Quality section above, the high ISO performance of the D7000 is greatly improved over the D90. The tests at dxomark.com tell this story, along with the fact that the native ISO range of the D7000 is 100-6400 expandable up to 25,600. The D5100 shares these specifications, and should offer similar results. The D3100 has a native ISO range of 100-3200 expandable to 12800, and the range of the D90 is 200-3200. This means that with the D7000 and D5100 you can use higher ISO settings when required, such as in low light situations, and not have as much difficulty with digital noise, particularly in the shadow areas of images.Controls: As with construction, the buttons and controls vary with these cameras. The D3100 and D5100 offer more limited, basic controls on the exterior of the camera.  However you can use the rear LCD screen to quickly change many settings, or else go into the menus.  The D7000 offers an extensive array of controls on the camera body, allowing one to quickly change an large number of settings as they work, including focus mode and focus area settings, shooting mode, and exposure mode. The controls of the D7000 are similar to the D90 with some changes including the addition of the shooting mode ring under the mode dial (to change from single shot to high speed continuous to self timer, etc.), and the live-view switch with movie record button inside it. The D7000 also offers 2 customizable user settings (U1, U2) on the mode dial, and you can assign functions of your choice to buttons such as the Fn Button.Menus and Custom Settings: These allow for greater control over customizing how the camera functions. The D5100 has less Menu and Custom Settings options than the D90 and the highly customizable D7000, and more than the D3100 (which offers no custom settings). These settings enable you to customize the operation, function, and controls to work how you want them to, including things like exposure increments, Live View options, tweaking how the autofocus system operates, setting more precise white balance settings, and customizing which button does what. There are ebooks such as my Nikon D7000 Experience - The Photographer's Guide to Operation and Image Creation with the Nikon D7000 and Nikon D5100 Experience - The Still Photographer's Guide to Operation and Image Creation with the Nikon D5100 which walk you through all of the Menu settings and Custom Settings so that you can set up your camera to work best for how you photograph, and also begin to learn to master all the advanced features, settings, and controls of these powerful dSLR camera.Wireless Flash: The D7000 includes the feature of advanced wireless lighting and remote flash control using the built in flash as a commander for off-camera Nikon Speedlights. However, the D5100 and D3100 do not have this capability.  You can trigger certain flashes with the built-in flash of these cameras, but not control the remote flashes and their settings.  With the D7000, you can set up one or more Speedlights in remote mode, then control and trigger them wirelessly with the built in flash of the camera.Viewfinder: The D5100 has a pentamirror viewfinder with approximately 95% coverage of the actual resulting image, the same as the D3100. The higher quality pentaprism viewfinder of the D90 gives 96% coverage of the actual resulting image, while the D7000 has an even larger, brighter pentaprism viewfinder with 100% coverage. Author's note:  this review was written and posted on Amazon by dojoklo - please do not steal it, post it elsewhere, and claim it as your own writing.  Thank you.  While in-and-of-itself, a 95% viewfinder works just fine, when you compare it side-by-side with the large, clear view of the D7000, you can see and understand the advantages of a clearer view of your entire scene with a 100% view, pentaprism viewfinder.Processor: The Nikon D5100 and D3100 use the fast Expeed 2 image processor just like the D7000. This allows for more video options including full 1080p HD at 24, 25, and 30 fps, overall faster processing of stills and video files, and the ability to maintain fast continuous speed shooting for numerous frames. The D90 has the older Nikon Expeed processor, which is also generally fast enough to handle its processing needs.Continuous Shooting Speed: As you work your way up the Nikon dSLR line-up the cameras' continuous shooting speed and maximum shots at that rate increases. The D3100 shoots 3 frames per second (fps) in continuous shooting mode, the D5100 shoots 4 fps, and the D7000 shoots 6 fps for up to 100 shots. The D90 can shoot 4.5 fps up to 100 images. If you often capture action and really need the higher frame rate, such as for sports, action, or wildlife shooting, you are going to have to seriously consider the D7000 over the other cameras. Paired with its advanced autofocus system, this fast frame rate can sharply capture moving objects is all types of situations. A nice feature of the D7000 is that you can adjust the low speed continuous mode to shoot anywhere from 1 to 5 fps, using the custom settings.Memory Card: The D5100, D3100, and D90 all use a single SD memory card. The D7000 accepts 2 SD cards, where the second card can be used in a variety of ways: overflow when the first card fills up, JPEG on one / RAW on the other, or mirrored backup of the first card. The second card can come in handy as well if one is shooting video files, and one card can be designated for stills and the other video.Battery and Battery Grip: The D5100 and D3100 both use the EN-EL14 battery, and the D7000 uses the new, higher capacity EN-EL15 battery. The D7000 accepts the optional MB-D11 battery pack/ vertical grip which is constructed of magnesium alloy. The D90 uses the EN-EL3e battery and its optional battery pack/ vertical grip is the MB-D80. The D5100 and D3100 don't accept a battery grip. The battery grip is handy for providing the ability to use a second battery and thus prolonging shooting time, and also creates a larger camera body which some users find more comfortable, especially when shooting in portrait orientation.Full HD video: The D5100 shoots 1080p and 720p video at 24, 25, and 30 fps. The D3100 shoots 1080p at 24 fps and 720p at 24, 25, and 30 fps. The D7000 also shoots 1080p at 24 fps only and 720p at 24, 25, and 30 fps, up to 20 minutes with full-time continuous autofocus. The D90 offers 720p video at 24 fps, with a 5 minute shooting time.Ease of Operation: While beginners may find all the buttons, controls, and menus of any dSLR difficult and confusing at first, the menus and controls of the D5100 and D3100 are pretty basic and simple to learn for a dedicated user. The additional controls and menus of the D7000 and D90 are all quite intelligently designed and will become intuitive and straightforward for the more advanced user once they are learned and understood. Again, have a look at helpful guides such as my Nikon D7000 Experience - The Photographer's Guide to Operation and Image Creation with the Nikon D7000 and Nikon D5100 Experience - The Still Photographer's Guide to Operation and Image Creation with the Nikon D5100 to begin to learn to master all the advanced features, settings, and controls of these powerful dSLR cameras.Hands on Experience:  The camera body of the D5100 fits nicely in the hand, and is a little bit taller than the D3100, so the pinky doesn't fall off the grip quite as easily.  The rubber gripping surface and rubber thumb spot work nicely, and help retain the grip on the body, even when holding it at your side or carrying it around without a strap, and the light weight of the camera also adds to this ease of portability.  Those who prefer the ergonomics of a larger, more solid feeling camera body will have to look at the D90 or D7000.  The Live View switch, placed on the top of the camera at the mode dial, feels and sounds a little plasticy, but works find, and the record button for movies is conveniently placed on the top of the camera, near the shutter button.  The FN button, on the front near the lens mount, can be customized to adjust one of a number of settings quickly, like image quality, white balance, HDR, or +RAW (to take a RAW file in addition to a JPEG if set on just JPEG).  I prefer to make it an ISO button.  The side mounted rear LCD screen is a definite improvement over the bottom mounted, limited screen of the D5000, and rugged and durable.  The view through the viewfinder is a bit tiny and cramped, as is typically the case in this level of dSLR.  Changing settings is quick and easy with the \"i\" button and rear LCD screen.  Overall, the body, feel, controls, and LCD screen of the D5100 make for a great image taking experience.", "Date": "April 18, 2011"}, {"Title": "Nice DSLR! Great images!", "Author": "Jeffrey", "ReviewID": "R399BVOI2UE6PL", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I have been a retired SLR photographer for several years so the D5100 is my re-entry into DSLR.  Previously, I had an N90s and one of the first digital Nikons; the D20.  I have been shooting a Canon G10 for several years even doing some HDR with it.  I've had the D5100 about a week and have shot a 100 photos on a variety of subjects - family, landscape, sunset, and macro - all with the 18-55 kit lens.It shoots great!  Detail is way better than I expected for a \"consumer\" model.  Actually, I chose the D5100 because the quality of the pics was my foremost goal.  It comes with the same 16mp chip as the D7000 for $400 less.  I wanted to spend that money on glass.  I've had almost no trouble figuring out how to set the manual controls and have had good luck with the SCENES modes for most shooting.  (I haven't tried the EFFECTS and I'm not sure that I will - more of a Photoshop processing kind of guy).  My biggest challenge has been getting correct focus as the camera tries to do way more than I'm used to and, if I have it in the wrong SCENE mode, there's no telling what might happen.  The dancing yellow squares on the face recognition function is a little disconcerting.  I have also had to learn patience as the VR function is nice but a little slow when handheld.  I have learned to leave it off until I really need it.I think that most of the professional reviewers overstate the weaknesses of many of the products out there and the D5100 is no exception, maybe because it's hard to difference a crowded competitive product line.  At any rate, here is my take on some of the deficiencies.  First, the location of the LiveView button work great for me.  Because it is a lever rather than a button it is easy to locate and use without moving my hand on the grip.  Another complaint has been the lack of an ISO button.  I do prefer buttons over menus but there are too many functions which I would like to have on a button that there wouldn't be room for all of them.  I programmed the fn button (which is done easily in the menus) to allow me to control the ISO.  It works well both when I'm working through the viewer or the display screen.  I will agree with complaints that the fn button is too close to the flash button.  I've inadvertently mixed them up and it cost me a pic or two.  However,  I only need to make that kind of mistake a couple of times before learn to avoid the problem.The rear screen is great...very high resolution.  The zooming function works well and I have been able to check image focus easily.  The side tilt is very elegant and I like that if flips to protect the screen when not in use.I'm not much of a videographer but I did shoot some video and the image quality if fantastic.  I put it on my TV and the quality was great.  The focus works pretty well although you can see it occasionally get behind for a few seconds for quick moving subjects - like cars and kids.  The microphone isn't worth much so it may be worth investing in the add-on microphone for more serious video projects.All in all, the quality and fit of the camera is very good in spite of being made from plastic.  i wouldn't want to drop it or the lens for that matter - they are not made like my old N90s or my 70-200 f2.8 but, on the other hand, I won't won't miss the extra 5 lbs. of weight because this camera is LIGHT!  It is small but fits the hand well and is joy to carry around.To summarize:  As you would expect from a Nikon, great photos; as good as the D7000 (according to dpreview) and $400 less.  Easy to use, light, good manual control, and good assisted control through scenes.  The D5100 is a good choice if you are looking for high quality images without all the bells and whistles of the D7000.No \"cons\" except don't drop it...probably won't survive!  Battery life isn't great either (I tend to use the display and LiveView a lot) so I've already invested in a backup battery.", "Date": "April 25, 2011"}, {"Title": "Nikon hits the bull's-eye with the D5100", "Author": "Roger J. Buffington", "ReviewID": "R31T7HM81EJ6LR", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "For once I really researched a camera purchase. I will begin with the end: the D5100 is a superb offering that will do as much as almost all non-professional users will ever need it to do, and has more useful features than most users will ever use. There are many competing cameras at or near this price point.  I cannot claim to have researched them all, but the D5100 really does seem to be the leader.  This camera is basically a feature-laden prosumer camera -- a camera for the enthusiastic amateur who wants a camera that will do most (but not all) things that a professional camera will do, with as little fuss as possible, and in a smaller package.The most important attribute of this camera is its ability to produce superb images right out of the camera. And great images start with great exposure.  This camera can produce outstanding images that really do not require post-processing.  I have been using Nikon digital SLR cameras since the D100 was announced, through the D80 and D200.  All have been superb cameras for their days and still are.  However, most Nikon DSLRs really benefited (needed, really) a bit of post-processing in order for the images to reach their full potential.  In particular, many users have noticed that the auto-contrast settings in Nikon or third-party software programs really brightened up images, giving them better contrast and zip.  This camera pretty much does away with that.  The D-lighting feature of this camera, combined with an all-around better sensor, exposure algorithm, and exposure system, really do make it possible to produce images right out of the camera that look like they have already been post-processed on the computer.  And to make matters even better, the camera allows in-camera editing and post-processing!  So if you are on a trip and want to email a few pictures you will not need your computer; the camera will do the post-editing job for you in most cases. And in most cases this is not needed at all. Put simply, the D5100 has about achieved the ideal for digital cameras, whereby it produces a final image right out of the camera that is about perfectly exposed, with contrast and lighting the way you want it.The camera allows for matrix, center-weighted, and spot metering, just like the pro cameras.  All are useful at times. I can remember when only professional cameras had all three.  We have come a long way.The D5100 continues the Nikon trend of better and better ISO performance, as light amplification technology keeps getting better.  ISO roughly corresponds to the exposure ratings of film in days of yore, and basically better ISO performance means that the camera will perform better in low light conditions, making it possible to take clear non-noisy images in dimmer light.  My D200, which was one of the very best Nikons in its day, degrades quickly after about ISO 640.  This camera will do many multiples of this satisfactorily.  For early morning photography, or taking pictures indoors, this is a decisive, tremendous advantage.Great images also require fast and accurate focusing.  The auto-focusing system on this camera is very well thought out for its market niche.  While professional photographers will probably not use this camera to photograph NFL games and the like, this camera features an excellent focusing system that will exceed the expectations of most users.  It is an 11 point system that intelligently focuses on a subject in the foreground or tracks a moving subject or, if you wish to exercise complete control, it will allow a single point (selectable) focus which can be useful for portraits of individuals and other types of still photography.  It also has continuous focusing as an option which can be great for sports or wildlife.  While pros and certain amateur photographers may need (or at least want) the more elaborate focusing systems available on Nikon's higher end cameras, for all but the most demanding users the D5100 is more than up to the job.  Its focusing system is better than the pro systems of a few camera generations ago.  If you want to photograph your kids playing sports, this camera will do the job, and likely do it brilliantly.  This excellent focusing system, combined with its available 4 frames-per-second capability, make this camera quite capable of producing quality images of difficult fast-moving subjects.Ergonomics.  I bought this camera for two main reasons: less size and less weight.  The higher-end Nikon cameras sport metal bodies, while this unit is made out of high-impact plastic.  Given the fact that even rifles and pistols are mostly made of plastic nowadays, I consider plastic to be a virtue, not a vice.  The D5100 features excellent build quality and has every bit of that quality \"Nikon feel\" that we have all come to expect.  While some pros and a few amateurs really may need a weather-sealed metal bodied camera, most of us do not.  And every single user will appreciate the very low weight of the D5100.  I carried mine all day on a family outing and for once I did not get tired of toting a camera.  I found the various buttons and controls to be easy to use and intuitive.  Some reviewers have complained about various aspects of the button placements, but honestly, I don't see it.  It is true that the camera requires a dedicated ISO button, because its wider ISO capability probably means that users will be varying this setting a lot.  Fortunately, the D5100 has a user-assignable Function button.  I simply assigned ISO as the function, so my D5100 has a dedicated ISO button.  I do find myself using it often, as I vary it to high ISO for indoor shots, to low ISO for bright sunny summer days.The color LCD screen on the D5100 opens to the side, and can be rotated 180 degrees.  Some reviewers have complained that: a) this means that one cannot put a plastic cover on the LCD to protect it; and b) the swivel arm on the LCD screen may be a mechanical weak link.  There may be a little truth to this, but consider.  Since the LCD screen folds against the back of the camera, if folded in screen first it is protected during field use, and yet easily accessible by swinging it out if you need to access it for some reason.  During field use (hiking, etc.) I rarely need to use the screen, and since it is folded against the camera, it is very well protected.  As far as the strength of the swivel arm, well, time will tell.  I trust that Nikon knew what it was doing when it designed this component.  Hope so.The LCD screen does multiple duty.  It performs the function that the mono LCD screens used to do on other Nikons, i.e. showing exposure mode, picture count, etc. (Many of these things are also displayed in the viewfinder.)  It also displays the menu system.  And of course you may view and edit the photographs with the LCD.  And the LCD also presents live-view, meaning that you get an instant through-the-lens electronic display of the viewfinder; a feature that until a few years ago only point-and-shoot cameras afforded.  I was initially skeptical of this feature, but I do find myself using it at times.  The viewfinder is bright and crisp, with a pleasing display.The menus are mostly intuitive.  I say mostly, because at first I had trouble locating some of the key functions that I wanted.  Specifically, the \"sharpening\" control, which is a critical setting, is buried three layers deep in the menus.  Other Nikons place this setting more obviously.  This quirk is the exception, and once I understood the logic of the menu setup, I have had no further problems.  Most users will adapt quickly to the menu system in this camera.The optical viewfinder features a 95% view of the actual lens picture.  Very few users will miss that 5%.The camera allows full shutter, aperture, and programmed mode just like the pro cameras.  The camera has other features including \"effects,\" and HDR (high dynamic range) shooting, which combines two shots of an image using different exposures.  While many users will never use these features, some will.  The HDR feature has real potential for those willing to experiment and put in the time to master it.To keep cost and weight down, the D5100 does not contain an inboard focusing motor.  This means that some of the older Nikon lenses do not have autofocus if used with the D5100 since some of these lenses do not have internal focusing motors.  This will mainly affect long-time photographers who have some of the older Nikon lenses in the bag.  Most newer users will never miss it.  Me, I do regret that a couple of my old stand-bys will not autofocus with this camera.  But most of them will, so there you are.  I bought the D5100 bundled with the AFS 18-55 3.5-5.6 VRII kit lens.  This is a very nice \"walking around\" lens that will do nicely for many applications.  For sports and wildlife most users will want a lens with longer reach.  But for many applications, i.e. vacations, portraits, etc., the kit lens will do very nicely.  It is equipped with Nikon's superb VRII stabilization system, which really makes this lens shine for still subjects in low light.  Given the D5100's excellent ISO performance, enhancing its low-light capability, this lens can really shine.I rarely shoot movies, but for those who do, this camera is a very serviceable HD videocamera.  Other reviews have no doubt covered this feature adequately.Overall Conclusion.  As the reader can tell, I am very enamored with the D5100.  At the end of the day it is the images that matter, and the D5100 produces professional-grade images.  On trips and other occasions I am often found carrying around a camera, and the light weight and small size of the d5100 make it a joy to use.  More and more I find myself reaching for the D5100 instead of my bigger, near pro-grade cameras.  In fact, the more I use the D5100 the more convinced I am that it is pretty close to being pro-grade itself.  Its size, weight, and capabilities, combined with its price, make the D5100 an excellent choice for many users.  Highly recommended.  RJB.", "Date": "July 25, 2011"}, {"Title": "It's a good camera with a few reservations (especailly the HDR feature)", "Author": "T Payne \"t_payne\"", "ReviewID": "R2UYVG4AN5NY5O", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "As with any review, a lot is dependent on the reviewer's taste, expectations and understanding of the product. So let me make it clear where I fit in there and then how this camera performed.I have a lot of photography and video experience but I am not a professional. What I EXPECT is a camera that is easy to use but powerful in features. I like seeing new technology even when it is sometimes inferior to older technology (I know some of you can relate to that). I expect good build quality and I expect that a camera does what it is advertised to do. This camera basically did not disappoint. But I will say honestly that I was comparing this to the D7000 even though the latter is a good $400 more expensive. But the D5100 was newer and it had some things the D7000 does not have that I thought were important to me:1. A swivel screen (I've never had a still camera with that). I am upgrading from a D70.2. Capable of HDR pictures with in-camera processing.3. Cheaper and lighter weight.Many of you may choose the D5100 for other reasons but these were mine. In the end, I returned it and bought the D7000 (that review is coming soon). Here is why:I like the idea of HDR photography and the D5100 can do it right in the camera! To explain why I gravitated towards this particular feature, I need to step back and mention an in-camera feature I had once on a point-and-shoot.  I used to have an HP camera and it helped you frame a panoramic picture. When you were done, it stitched it together. Voila! You had a panoramic picture ready to go. When I upgraded to the next model, it also had a panoramic feature to help you frame it, but it did not do in-camera stitching (as most all cameras do not these days). Instead, you are supposed to stitch it with the software the camera comes with. So guess what happened? Nothing....I stopped doing panoramic pictures, because I was too lazy to take the time to find the right pictures, import them into the software, stitch and then export it back to the right folder - too much hassle.Well, the idea with in-camera HDR was a real selling point for me on the D5100. As of this writing, I am not aware of any other camera that does this (I'm sure someone will correct me?). So this may be the #1 reason I ended up getting the D5100 and it is the #1 I returned it. If you look at Nikon's website they advertise this feature and show an example of a lighthouse - the result is stunning, just as you would expect from HDR. Let me just say flat-out: this will not be the result you see in the real-world. I took about 100 different high-contrast shots and most of them looked better with the HDR processing but most of them only looked *marginally* better. The shadows had more detail and the bright areas were less blown out. So it works. But I then bracketed +2,0,-2 images and plugged them into Photomatrix and BAM! Now that's HDR! No comparison whatsoever. It turns out, the Nikon D5100's version of HDR is to take just two shots (-3,+3 , or some variation on the stops) and then it combines it into one image. If the (+3) shot was a little blurry, because over-exposed shots tend to be this way, then the final HDR image is blurry too. Now when this happens on a bracketed set, that is OK, because you still have the normal (0) exposure to take back with you at the end of your vacation. But if the D5100 made a bunch of blurry shots, you are hosed. There is no way to recover from that. You would have to analyze every shot closely on that little 3\" screen to verify you got the shot or you would need to take duplicates with normal exposure just to make sure. Also, the HDR feature is not even written in the instruction manual - go ahead and look...no where to be found! I had to look it up in the longer online pdf manual to see how to use the feature, and it turns out you have to press about 6 buttons pretty deep in the menu just to get the camera to take an HDR. Once you depress the shutter, you have to go back through the whole menu again. Ridiculous! Finally, I figured out you can assign the \"Fn\" button to handle this, which was really a very good workaround. So all in all, I was really excited about in-camera HDR and in reality, it was a big disappointment. Now on to the other stuff:The swivel screen: You either love it or hate it. I hated it, but that has nothing to do with the actual camera, just the concept. Basically I think it's mechanically the weakest point of the camera. That little swivel is just asking to snap off the next time I chase my son around the house and back into a corner or cabinet. I can guess it would cost a fortune to have Nikon fix that. Also, I am not into swiveling the screen closed so the screen faces the camera when I am done shooting. I am simply not that meticulous. I want to have a spontaneous camera that I can pick up and shoot whenever I want. So what's the point if I have to un-swivel the screen every time I want to use it and then swivel it closed when I am done. Also, think of all that wear-and-tear. So if you don't close it properly then it is liable to get scratched over time. The D7000 and all the other fixed LCD DSLRs have a plastic screen protector that costs a few bucks to replace - you can't really use a screen protector on the D5100. So either you swivel it closed every time or you risk scratching the screen. In the end, I felt the swivel screen took away from my spontaneity and made me think about not scratching the screen all the time.Now a few general things: The camera is lighter and cheaper than the D7000. That can be good or bad depending on how you look at it. But for how much this camera costs, I don't want it to feel cheap - and it does. I compared both cameras and it was the little things like how the buttons felt and how the grip was shaped that made the D5100 feel a lot cheaper. Also the 18-55mm lens it comes with is really very limiting. I am not interesting in being one of those people that walks around with 3 lenses in a huge 10lb bag that I carry everywhere. The D7000 comes with the 18-105mm which is not amazing, but it is much better for general use. I personally went with the Tamron 18-270mm, but that's another story. Here are some other things to consider: The D5100 has a bunch of \"Effects\" like \"miniature\", \"fisheye\", etc. These can be done much more easily in the D5100 than in the D7000 where you have to apply the effect to a picture after you take it while the D5100 applies it immediately to the picture. But these are just gimmicks for me - you try the effect out once and move on.After thoroughly playing with the D5100, the D7000 became an easy choice. For $400 (of course, it's $400 when you compare just the cost of the bodies not the kits) you get a lot of manual buttons so you don't have to dive into menus to change things. You get a dedicated screen on the top that gives you critical info. You get a weather-sealed case with the top and back being magnesium alloy. You get 2 custom user settings, faster more precise focusing and a better lens with the kit. So you say, \"no duh, you pay more, you get more\". That is true, but my logic was that the D5100 is not really all that cheap to begin with. If I'm shelling out serious cash for a DSLR, it better not feel like a toy in my hand - the D5100 feels like a toy. It also has very few buttons which means any time you want to make a change, you need to dive into a menu. Gosh I hate that! I have a Canon G10 which is more capable - at least it has an ISO and exposure dial right there on the top - no menus no nothing, and it is just a fancy point-and-shoot.As for the video, I appreciated the fact that the D5100 takes 1080p at 30FPS unlike the D7000 which maxes out at 24FPS. I do video with a far more capable dedicated video camera, so I didn't really bother with this. But from the little I saw, the built-in microphone was weak and the auto-focus was sluggish, inaccurate and loud ( you can hear the focusing in your video). I would only use the camera's video if I was desperate. The D7000 performed no better.As far as picture quality goes, I am not a pro, but I did compare identical pictures to the D7000 at the pixel level and I am convinced they are the same chips. The pictures are simply awesome. Beautiful color, sharp, clean and excellent light sensitivity. You really will have a hard time complaining.IN CONCLUSION: Although it \"feels\" like a toy after you hold the D7000, it is a well-built camera that takes excellent pictures and can do most of the same things the D90 and D7000 are capable of - you just have to hunt for the stuff you need. I do not like hunting for things when a photo-opportunity arises. The HDR feature is mostly useless and could potentially ruin some pictures. The swivel LCD may be useful for some but I did not like it. If the camera is used mainly for a family get-together, a European vacation or even to take short videos of your kids and pets, then this is an excellent choice. If you are like me and enjoy HDR photography, astrophotography, macro-shots and have a deeper understanding of how all the features of how cameras work (like why you would change the metering from \"Matrix\" to \"spot\" or why it's useful to change ISO settings all the time, etc) then you will be really frustrated by the D5100 - you are better off spending the money and getting the D7000. I give this camera 4 stars because the HDR feature was a big selling point and it is useless by my standard. I would knock off another half-star for not having at least a dedicated button to change ISO and for having weak video capabilities, but I'm feeling generous tonight ;)I hope you found this review helpful.

It's a work horse, but it's heavy. I was looking for a camera that I could use as more of an every day type of camera. You know, something to grab to take a few shots without a lot of fuss, weight and fooling with settings. In other words, a fun, easy to use camera.I had purchased one of the Micro Four Thirds cameras because it was light and small, but I found the quality lacking when compared to APS-C cameras. Also, most of the available Micro Four Thirds lenses are way too expensive for the quality you get with them; they're not that great. (The exception is the Panasonic 20mm lens - that's a good lens. Perhaps still a bit expensive.)Enter the D5100. When I saw this camera, I knew it would be exactly what I was looking for. It's small, lightweight, easy to use but still maintains superb image quality. It's really outstanding in low light. I don't know what kind of algorithms Nikon is using, but shooting at ISO 1600 is no problem. Even the shots at ISO 3200 look good and clean up nicely.The great thing about this camera is that it's versatile and flexible. You can shoot in auto, or you can use Aperture or Shutter priority for more control. If you're an advanced user, you'll be happy for the manual mode that allows you total control.This camera really is the best of both worlds. A camera that an advanced amateur can use and at the same time feel confident that he/she can hand over to an inexperienced spouse or friend and know that the camera won't be too much for them to handle.It's really a nice fit between the D3100 (more features, same sensor as the D7000) and less expense and bulk of the D7000.

For normal use, it is impossible to tell the difference between an image made with either camera.  The D5100 does offer a bit better low light performance.  However it will not benefit most amateur users that much, if at all. That said, either Nikon is superior to any Canon DSLR for flash photography.  Nikon's iTTL flash system is better at metering and producing properly exposed images than anything Canon offers, regardless of price.  In fact, Nikon's TTL system from 20 years ago is better than anything Canon offers today.  If you NEVER use flash, Canon is a wonderful choice.  Canon cameras offer rich, saturated colors.  All my compact digital cameras are made by Canon, including the wonderful S95.  I am not a anti-Canon Nikon fan.  I do use Nikon SLR film and digital SLR cameras.  Many choose to minimize the benefits of the Nikon flash system.  Don't choose a camera system without considering it.  Nikon makes the best flash system. Period.For those that want to compare the D5100 to the D7000.  Don't.  The D7000 exceeds the needs of nearly every amateur.  Its biggest practical difference for most users is compatibility with Nikon Ais and AF lenses made since 1977.  Unless you already own older Nikkor lenses or plan on buying them now, the AFS lenses made today will more than meet your needs.  Too many people buy DSLRs for ego.  Don't be one of them.  Buy a Nikon DSLR that works with your budget and immediately buy a separate flash, such as the capable and inexpensive Nikon SB-400, and learn and enjoy photography.  Only you can make good photographs.  The camera has very little to do with it.  Don't believe anyone that tells you otherwise.  Professionals have far different needs than you and me.  I have a Nikon D200, a Nikon 8008, and a Nikkormat FTn.  I have been using an slr for 37 years, ever since I was twelve. You will not go wrong with the D3100 or the D5100.

I don't think i've left the house without is since I bought it a week and a half ago.  This was really my first foray into serious photography.  I skipped right over the point and shoot stage and got one of these.  I consulted a friend of mine who teaches art and photography courses at the university where I work and eventually landed on the 5100.  I looked hard at the D7000, but didn't want to forfeit the extra coin.  Now I kind of wish that I had.As I said before, I love the camera, BUT...As my friend told me, there are lots of functions buried in menus rather than being available directly on the camera body.  I didn't think it would bother me since this was really my first d-slr. I am a quick learner though and i'm now shooting in manual mode pretty confidently.  That being said there are some things that I wish weren't in menus such as ISO, focus mode, metering, shutter release mode, picture control, bracketing, etc...  There are a few features like ISO and shutter release mode that can be mapped to the self timer button (one or the other) but then you lose the functionality of the immediate access to the self timer.  The fact that shutter speed and aperture are controlled with the same command dial (shutter by turning the command dial alone and aperture by holding the exposure compensation/aperture button and then turning the command dial) isn't too much of a burden, but when you have to hold 2 buttons AND turn the command dial to adjust flash compensation it gets a bit tedious.I would have liked to have the 2 SD card slots that the 7000 has to store raw and jpg on separate cards, but oh well - not that big of a deal.  Although the camera is made of some sort of plastic composite material (what isn't these days?), it feels substantial and well-made in your hands.All in all, you will not be disappointed with this camera.  It takes amazing images and the effects mode will have some nice surprises for you.  You can do some basic editing directly on the camera as well.  Live view is very nice with the variable angle display but you can't see the light/ISO meter on it.  the body of the camera is compact and light so you don't feel like you have a  laptop hanging from your neck.  I've found the battery life to be marvelous when you don't use the flash or live view extensively.  I was glad that spare/replacement batteries aren't too expensive for this baby either.There is a learning curve to using the menus, but they are surprisingly more intuitive than I expected.  If you can read and make use of the help button, you will be able to figure out a lot without even looking at the manual!  I do recommend reading the manual that lives on the CD that comes with your camera.  I have copied that to my hard drive and my smart phone for quick reference.  It goes into much more detail than the paper manual that comes with the camera.If this is your first experience with a d-slr, you aren't a stickler about having functions istantly available or you need a very good, lightweight backup d-slr because you don't want to carry your full-bodied model, stop searching through reviews and get yourself one of these!  You WILL NOT be disappointed.Once you take the plunge, there's no looking back though!  You will be scouring the internet for deals on lenses, filters and everything d-slr related!  As my friend told me, it's like an infection or being in a cult - but not in a bad way; whatever that means!  ;)I'm in love with this camera, but when she get's old i'm going after her big sister, who has more functions on her body!!Have fun with your new D5100!", "Date": "June 22, 2011"}, {"Title": "Extensive Review By Photography Newbie", "Author": "Alan Montgomery", "ReviewID": "R8BTYUFSU0TUU", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This review is aimed at people who are new to photography, as I am in the same boat.  There are much more thorough reviews on Amazon for people who are already serious photographers.General Impression:Wonderful camera - gives you control of parameters (such as f/stop, ISO, shutter speed) when you want to play with them or get creative and will auto-select them when you just want to take pictures.  This was important to me as I am still learning to adjust them to my liking but don't want to miss out on pictures because I'm fumbling around with buttons.Construction/Feel:After going to Best Buy to physically hold the Canon T3i and Nikon d5100, I immediately decided on the Nikon.  It felt much better in my hands and just looked better in general.  Both were fairly light which is nice but also means they are made from quite a bit of plastic - not a problem though as this keeps the price down and I don't drop things.Controls:I have been pleased with the placement of the physical buttons on the camera as well as the menus.  I mainly shoot in the A, S, and M modes and the little wheel you turn to adjust the shutter speed/aperture is right where your thumb falls.  If you're in M mode, there is an aperture button to hold down just behind the shutter button which is also easy to reach with the camera up to your eye.  Lastly, the Fn button can be programmed to control the ISO level so you can hold it down while spinning the wheel to change that without putting the camera down.  I have heard people complain that the Live View switch is annoying to get to but have found it intuitive.There are a few controls that I wish were changeable without having to dig through a menu though.  For instance, to change the focus mode from area to single point requires you to have the LCD screen turned around, then press the I button, then scroll around to change it.  This is the case for a few other things like metering, shutter mode, etc.  I can't really complain, though, because those are features that go on a serious photographer's camera that costs about twice as much as this model.Auto Focus:The 11-point AF on this camera has been a dream to use.  I almost always keep the camera set to single point servo autofocus so I can select the point I want it to focus to.  As long as you have some contrast, it is very quick and accurate to focus.  This camera does not have a build in focus motor which means the lens must have it built in.  As a result, older lenses or those build for the professional Nikons may not allow for autofocus.  This hasn't been a big issues as most of the lenses I would want already have the motor built in, and if they don't, people survived for a long time manually focusing - it probably builds character.  I was torn between getting the Nikon 10-24mm f/3.5-4.5G ED AF-S DX Nikkor Wide-Angle Zoom Lens for Nikon Digital SLR Camerasand Tokina AT-X116PRDXN AT-X PRO DX 11-16mm Ultra-wide Angle Lens for Nikonand ended up sticking with the Tokina even though it would not autofocus on this camera.  I haven't had any issues with focusing manually with it as the ultra-wide angles are easy to focus anyway.Noise:A lot of the reviews I read before purchasing this camera talked about how well it shot in low light - I would have to agree.  Looking at pictures from my old point and shoot at ISO 800 have horrible noise while I can shoot this at 1600 without any, and can go up to 3200 with only minimal touch ups in Lightroom needed.  This has to be the single biggest advantage of digital over film - being able to change ISO on the fly and still being able to get great pictures at ISO 3200 is wonderful.Image Quality:I won't offer too many opinions in this section, but I have not seen anything but great quality in the RAW pictures I've taken.  Basically I understand that if a picture doesn't come out right, the fault lies with me and not the camera.  The camera is capable of much better pictures than I am capable of taking.  When I do everything right (which is becoming a little more frequent) I am amazed of the result.  Great colors, great contrast, low noise, etc.Battery Life:I purchased an extra battery before I went on a few business trips just in case, but ended up never being close to needing it.  The battery just lasts and lasts and never seems to drain.  For instance, last weekend I took 381 shots (some using live view) and the battery meter was still at 75%.  No complaints in this department.Flash:The built in flash is pretty puny, which seems to be par for the course.  It does provide some nice fill lighting if you're outside taking pictures where there are some shadows on your subject, but for shooting inside it's marginal at best.  I bought the very reasonably priced Nikon SB-400 AF Speedlight Flash for Nikon Digital SLR Cameras and have been very pleased with the combo.  The external flash adds the ability to bounce light off the ceiling and not waste the camera battery while doing so. This camera does not have the Nikon flash commander ability, but I don't think that should be expected in a camera at this price point.  If I ever start buying 3 remote flashes for studio shooting, there is a good chance I will have already upgraded cameras.I'll end by saying that this has been an absolutely wonderful camera to learn to shoot on.  Before I purchased it or started shooting, I ordered and read two books,Complete Digital Photography, 6th EditionThe Digital Photography Book, Volume 1 so I would have some clue what I wanted in a camera.  They are both wonderful books and should be required reading for all new photographers.As a disclaimer: up till 3 months ago I was never in to photography, never owned an SLR and never had any real interest to.

I bought the F2 for $350 from the Altman camera store in Chicago in 1975 and still have it. I have bought MANY various cameras since of all shapes, brands and sizes.I now own a Nikon 5100. I am relentlessly ASTOUNDED by the things this camera can do and the AMAZING, almost 3D, images it produces.These images are very often FAR SUPERIOR to ones put out by the Nikon F professional line.Images just as amazing can be captured with the Nikon D3100 and other DSLR Nikons INCLUDING the D40. The ever increasing megapixels is a MARKETING gimmick. There is no new scientific innovation, each year, that makes it possible for the camera makers to produce new cameras with higher megapixels. This is simply done to entice people, especially men who's egos drive them to own the latest, greatest and TECHNICALLY better, to \"upgrade\" and spend their money.HERE'S A COUPLE OF DIRTY LITTLE SECRETS: You don't get much difference in PHOTO quality by putting more money into the body. What you get is more bells and whistles. Not to say that's bad. It's COOL if you have the money. The new cameras have metering systems and other features we didn't even DREAM about back in the F series days. In terms of image quality, the more important piece of equipment is the LENS. Nikon calls the D40 to the D7000 \"Entry Level\" or \"pro-sumer\" models to entice you to SPEND MORE MONEY. HOW are these cameras \"entry level\" when they can take ANY one of the previous \"PRO\" film models and KICK THEIR ASS???Here's the last quirky reason for the misconception: Even with the previous PRO model cameras it took years of learning and experience and TALENT to produce professional looking images. There was pride in calling yourself a Pro Photographer because your photographs were usually far superior to those who took snap shots. Today's cameras automatic exposure features are SO good that ANYONE can take amazing photos in about 15 minutes as long as they have an eye for framing good shots. It is immensely disappointing, and a real blow to the ego, of people who fancy themselves a professional or highly experienced photogs when Joe Blow or Suzy Homemaker whips out their beautiful photographs of the kids that they took THEMSELVES with their D40. For some, their recourse is to say you're not a pro unless you have a $5,000 camera. You just have an \"entry level\" camera (even though you may be using the exact same lens as they do.)The \"pro\" will spout about shooting RAW, then using $200 software to \"tweak\" his photos. But is it worth investing your considerable time and money when, probably, 96% of people cannot SEE the difference or care? If you can afford the top of the line camera body then buy it. But don't get suckered into spending more than you can afford by marketing gimmicks and resentful \"Pro\" photographers making stupid comments. If you can keep your ego in check you will LOVE whatever camera you decide is right for you.

I read much of the pre-release hype and hoped that this would be the one.  The early pro reviews seem to indicate that you will be happier with a jump to the 5100 if you can afford it and I agree.I've had less than a day so far with it and I'm loving this one.  I instantly felt comforable with it in my hand.  It comes with a printed manual and pdf which is nice.  I had a blast this morning shooting birds w/ the Nikkor 70-300 lens.

JAMES \"NIKONMAN\"", "ReviewID": "R264FN4DT11K9A", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "The last thing I needed was another Nikon DSLR but when I saw the specs and the giveaway price I persuaded myself it was just a back-up\\ body I was buying to supplement my clutch of pro-bodies, a somewhat ancient D2x and a D2h, that have been weighing me down for the past 5 years or so. Out of the box, and with the almost fully charged battery inserted, I could not believehow little it weighed, and how small it was compared to my old clunkers. I think if you had particularly large hands you may find it a little too small, but I found the fit quite perfect. I tried my everyday Nikkor 17-55mm on the body and it felt very unbalanced with this heavy metalled lens attached. I then put on a Series 1 18-200mm VR Nikkor and it felt much better. In fact I have not removed it over several weeks of solid use, now over 9,000 shutter actuations! And being a Nikon, it hasn't missed a beat -yet!I shoot mainly weddings and other event stuff as well as all the usual friends and family pics that we all do. From the start I found the resolution and image quality quite outstanding particularly when I needed to crank it up to ISO3200 for some shots near dusk.I have to say it just blows away the results I used to get from the D2x in those same or similar lighting conditions. The new generation 16MP sensor is now a generation or two ahead of the 12.2MP sensor aboard the D2x, and boy doesn't it show?For a camera aimed squarely at the lower end of the \"enthusiast\" sector this offering from Nikon has made me wonder if professional photographers will continue to cough up for the D300s, the D700 and the base model D3. OK the latter two are full frame not DX and I can see the need for these expensive models in certain applications but heck, I can buy 2 D5100 bodies forthe price of a D300s and win on almost every count that I consider is of importance to my work. Higher resolution, better image quality video autofocus and continuous video focus, lower noise at high ISO, Built-in HDR, a lot more dynamic range, significantly better colour depth, flip-out screen, 6400 ISO and better boost to  25,600.  It's smaller , lighter and half the price.  OK no built in motor for non AF-S lenses, and the 300s scores on speed, battery life and a few other areas over the D5100, which even scoresheavily in an out of league comparison with the mighty D3s!It is well made from high quality plastic, which would probably put off many enthusiasts and pro-users - but I have already put it through the high impact drop test - inadvertently, of course! I dropped it and the 18-200mm zoom on a stone floor from about 1.5meters. The only damage was a broken card door which I can replace for under a fiver in the US. No other damage apart from a slight dent in the lens hood.I haven't shot much video yet but what I have seen so far is of the highest  quality imaginable when run at 1080 and 30fps - quite stunning footage I must say. I suppose I miss the easy screen and button based logic of the D2x and there is a certain clumsiness involved with the menu embedded functionality of the D5100 - but when in doubt , or short of time just head for the Auto setting or any one of the prescribed modes on the dial to suit your needs.As you may have guessed, the D5100 is not my back-up at all. I use it all the time now with the D2x just sitting in my bag.

I visited many stores to try different brands and models, including its closest competitor Canon Rebel T3i. I also borrowed from friends to try as well. In the end, D5100 was the winner based on my hands-on experience. You probably have read numerous reviews and got more confused. I was one of you. My advice: visit a store and try cameras yourself.I like the way D5100 fits in my hands (good ergonomics); it is lighter and smaller to carry around (in comparison with other DSLRs); though it is made of plastic (most entry- and mid- level DSLRs are) yet very solid and well- built; its shutter sound is music to my ear; its menu is instinctive and thus easy to get used to; the swivel 3\" LCD screen is very convenient; its battery life is relatively long, especially if you use viewfinder instead of live-view most of the time (you should try to do so, as most pros do); its auto-focus is swift and accurate, no \"hunting\" most of the time; it takes sharp and beautiful pictures, thanks to its newly updated software and hardware; lastly, I like the silver shutter button (I am vain)!However, if you have a smaller budget, the D3100 is the next best thing, and it produce wonderful pictures, too. If you can afford, of course get the D7000 with more buttons to play with and a heavier body to carry around, though the picture quality is about the same as D5100 (same sensor and pixel count) in most shooting conditions.In addition, the kit lens (18mm - 55mm) it comes with is surprisingly good and sharp (tested by \"professionals\"), which means that you don't need to upgrade your lens gears right away until you are ready to (or your finance allows you to). Believe me, the camera body may become the cheapest asset once you get into serious photography. The lenses are expensive, but they do keep their values. On the other hand, camera body, like cars, depreciates.I am not bias towards Nikon and against others. In fact, I have Sony and Canon, and still own 35mm film Nikon and Pentax. From my experience, D5100 is the best in its class that fits all my needs and most requirements. At the beginning of my search, I charted pros and cons of all possible candidates and ended without conclusions. Then, I realized that, just like buying a car, I needed to \"test drive\" the cameras also! After all, buying a DSLR is not an easy decision, because it is not a cheap toy (for me anyway) and may accompany for years to come.Furthermore, D5100 can dress-up or dress-down. For a professional, it offers most functions (and some more) that you can fine tune and adjust. However, if you just want an upgrade from a point-n-shoot, it has AUTO and SCENES that you don't need to fiddle anything yet take amazing pictures. Just practice and familiarize with the camera's buttons and functions, you will be very happy with it.Remember, a camera is only a tool. YOU, the photographer, are the one that takes good (or bad) pictures, not the camera. In this modern era, most DSLRs are capable of producing sharp and colorful pictures. The pixel counts, sensors, noises, abrasions, or distortions, etc. can be meaningless, if you don't know how to take good pictures.

If you are looking for a starter camera or a back up body to the D7000 this is it.Here are the major differences between the D5100 and D7000.D5100Exact same sensor and processing abilities as the D7000.  Some of the best Image Quality available in any DSLR.  ISO 3200 is very usable with low noise.- Swivel screen while the D7000 is fixed -- Since the contrast autofocus (ie Live View) is not very good on either of these cameras this is not really a player unless you are using a tripod.  Then the swivel screen is very useful.- 4 fps vs 6 fps for D7000 - No big deal 4 fps is plenty fast to fill your card with similar looking pictures.  Also, in RAW D7000 buffers out pretty fast and then slows down anyway.- 11 focus points vs 39 for D7000 - Most of the time not really a big deal.  Sometimes all those extra points get in the way and slow you down.No internal auto focus motor while the D7000 has one -- If you don't have any D series or older lenses this is not an issue.  If you do, they will not autofocus on this camera.- Only one SD slot vs 2 for the D7000 -- A big difference when getting paid to shoot.  Otherwise, always format your cards in your camera and not on the computer.  Doing that I have never had a failure. (Jinxed myself now)Not weather sealed vs D7000 partially weather sealed - Don't drop either one in the water and keep both out of dust.- Has less external switches than the D7000 - This means you need to go to the menus more often which slows things down.  This can be severely annoying or not depending on your shooting style.  The D7000 handles better but this is not a deal breaker on the D5100.Built in flash is not a commander for Nikon Creative Light System while D7000 is -- If you don't use off camera flash or you use radio triggers this is not a big deal.1.2 lbs vs 1.7 lbs for D7000.Overall the D5100 is a great camera.  The D7000 have some extra features that make it worth the extra money but if you don't need them you get all the fantastic D7000 IQ for 2/3rd the price.", "Date": "May 23, 2011"}, {"Title": "Great Simple DSLR", "Author": "El Guapo", "ReviewID": "R1FDOAY3VLC8CF", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I've only had the D5100 for a few days, and I love it. I loved it out of the box. Before buying it, I'd been considering the more expensive Nikon D7000 and the Canon EOS 60D. But being the type of guy who is in general very technology/gadget challenged, I knew I'd never use 90% of the available features on either camera, so I couldn't really justify the extra expense.What I love immediately about the D5100 is how easy it is to use right out of the box. Pictures are of course phenomenal, and in particular I've enjoyed using the \"Night Vision\" effect setting to capture some excellent black & white images of my pets in poor lighting without having to irritate them with a flash. Video is terrific and very easy to use. I expect I'll have a ton of fun with this camera.Cons? It's a bit plasticky feeling, but do I really care? No. I won't be lugging this camera to the top of Mt. Everest, nor shooting action pics in the rain. One issue is that it is virtually impossible to find a compatible fast fixed focal length 85mm+ portrait lens unless you want to spend significantly more than you paid for the camera itself - which I do not. For this camera's motor to drive the lens in AF, you will need to use AF-S/AF-I lenses only, and there are not a lot of great [fast] affordable portrait lens options in that class, IMHO. But being at most a very casual photo kind of guy, I can live with that shortcoming.

The D5100 performs very well in low light situations and also has a high dynamic range to handle difficult high contrast situations.Additional note:  A nice \"bonus\" feature is that this camera can use old manual focus lenses - even the non-AI models.  They can only be used in Manual exposure mode.  You will have to use an external meter to calculate exposure (or use the histogram information in the photo playback to check exposure). If you don't mind using classic, old-school photography technique, lenses like the 50mm f1.4 and 55mm micro Nikkor can acquired at very low cost.  They can produce outstanding results with this camera using the \"Rangefinder\" mode to help indicate when your subject is in focus.  You will need to make sure that the lens that you want will not interfere with the mirror in the camera - this caveat would mostly apply to older fish-eye and specialty lenses that were designed to use with the mirror locked-up in the older film cameras of the day.", "Date": "November 26, 2011"}, {"Title": "Black Photos Nikon D5100", "Author": "S. fox", "ReviewID": "R2LRVO4AB7SCNL", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "I've had the Nikon D5100 just a few weeks shy of a year.

The image sensor is the absolute best in a consumer SLR, which trumps any offering from Canon (even the 7D, just check out the numerical quality benchmarks by DxOMark).

Terms like sturdier, lighter, heaver, more solid, easier to use, more comfortable, etc., have NO meaning generically. If you wouldn't buy a $75 pair of shoes without trying them on, why on earth would you buy a camera that way? With that in mind, for me the D5100 is perfect. I handled the D7000 and the D5100, and I felt a lot surer with the D5100. Maybe it has to do with my wrists or fingers or whatever, but in the end, it doesn't matter. And when I bought a $30 sleeve that 'gloves' the entire apparatus, psychologically at least, I made up for any 'heft' a heavier camera might offer. Prior to my purchasing this camera, I had a heavier, \"sturdier\" Nikon model, and walking around with it for five hours did not make praise its virtues.  More like it tempted me to throw it off a bridge.  There's some talk of the puny number of focal points on this camera. I think there quite enough.  I've done theatrical photography with this camera, and you can imagine focusing is a delicate matter in low light, multiple points of focus imagery, and I had no problem. Which brings me to the 'pro' vs 'consumer' issue. As far as I'm concerned, there's just one major difference between the needs of a 'professional' photographer and an 'am-pro-sum-teur' or whatever dumb appellation people come up with: and that's durability under a wide range of conditions. If photography is your bread and butter, and your shooting 1,000 frames a day -- covering SWAT team assaults or civil wars or photographing mountain goats in the Himalayas on a regular basis, I'd say you need a D800, or even slum it with a D7000.  But otherwise, if you could use the (minimally) $500 you save with the D5100 to take a trip to your favorite secluded island, get it. You might end up with shots you'd never have a chance on taking since you'd never get there geographically in the first place.If your the Benjamin Franklin type, and need to list the pros and cons of everything prior to making a decision, my way of thinking might not work for you. But then again Benjamin Franklin wasn't known for his aesthetic genius; it was for his engineering and diplomatic skills.Last, consider this: on the off chance you LOSE or get your $1,500 to $3,000 camera and all its gear STOLEN, you could be F_____d.

Not being as dextrous as I once was I wanted something that gave me pin sharp pics out of the box without having to fuss through lengthy menus for a custom set up. The 5100 did not disappoint in any department. With my 5 year old 18-200mm attached the camera at first felt just a little unbalanced but 5 minutes later it felt a lot better to me than it did on my old D200. Results have amazed me especially at the ISO6000 level and above, and just for fun,I put it up against the D200, my neighbors D3 and my son's D2X - have to say the 5100 blew them all away using an old 50mm f1.4 ai-s in manual focus of course! I cannot fathom the comments from a recent reviewer, who signs off as a pro, and who mentions a Canon Rebel having better IQ than the 5100.  No pro I know would use either camera as a day to day working tool, they are just not made for that kind of hard work. Although when you think about it you could buy 6 of the 5100's for less than the price of a D3s. Now that's a thought for a pro who wants to go ultra lightweight! But getting back to the image quality issue, I have to report just one thing - There Is No Issue!! It is a super sharp machine with any decent lens you care to put on it. The video output is excellent and on a Samsung 50\" LCD in HDMI mode the picture quality was better than I could ever have hoped for. Crystal clear with outstanding sound quality. OK so it doesn't have a waterproofed Titanium and Kevlar shell, the buttons seem to be getting smaller on all Nikons,the video controls and logic are problematic but no doubt curable with a firmware upgrade.The liveview switch is not exactly conveniently placed either and I could go on with other picky findings.

I have achieved amazing results over the years with my D700+14-24mm lens. However, when you're almost 70 years old with a bad back, lugging around a heavy camera and wide angle lens can be a daunting task - not to mention having to stoop down constantly to look through the viewfinder. Enter the Nikon D5100. Yep. I will dare to admit that I was astounded by the quality of the Nikon D5100 + Sigma 10-20mm lens. WHAT? No Nikon lens? I tried Nikon's version and didn't like it. Got better results with a $479 Sigma lens. My clients can't tell the difference. WHAT?  As good as a full frame camera?  Yes. But, there are things that I do miss.  The ability to change K temperature. Also the ability to bracket 9 shots but the D5100 does an amazing job with 3 shots by using +/- 2EV. The D700 is +/- 1EV.  Another thing that annoys me with the D5100 is the sound of the shutter. It's not distinct as the D700. Sometimes I have a hard time telling when the shutter has been fully completed when bracketing. For some reason, it makes several distinct noises unlike the D700 is final after shooting the last frame. I won't comment on the other raves reviews that have been given the D5100. They're all true and would be redundant to mention them. One last annoyance is the build of the D5100. Very plasticky and cheap feeling but it's probably because I'm so used to the magnesium alloy feel of the D700 and also the price to pay for a much lighter camera. But at this price I can afford 2 backup D5100s. I'm now eagerly awaiting the next DSLR offering from Nikon.

Smith", "ReviewID": "RTR8HRI80SPCT", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "After seeing some beautiful HDR photos, I was inspired to start taking photos for myself.  I settled on the Nikon D5100 and have enjoyed the experience so far.  Never having used a dSLR, the first thing one notices is, \"Wow.  These photos are great!  You mean, I can actually take a photo in this dark room and not have it blown out with harsh camera mounted flash?!  This is awesome!\" :)One of the things that I like about the D5100 that I did not think I would is the articulating LCD screen.  I didn't think I'd need it, thought it would be in the way, and thought I'd want those buttons on the left hand side of the screen more than the ability to move the screen around.  I have used this feature many, many times and have gotten some good photos because of it.  It works well to frame shots when the camera is low to the ground or in an otherwise hard area to put your eye to the viewfinder.  Also, if you're out in the bright sun, you can angle the screen so you can actually see what's on it instead of sun glare.What pushed me over the edge in getting the D5100 over the D3100 is the availability of the wireless remote.  With the D3100, you need to get the cable remote.  The wireless remote works with the D5100 from both the front and back of the camera.  There were other points; MP, fps, etc.; but the remote pushed me over the top.The camera has many features I am still learning to use and enjoy.  If this is also your first dSLR experience, I recommend reading up on photography on the web and taking a beginning photography course.  Knowing what f-stop, shutter speed, exposure value, depth of field, ISO, mean and how you use them to take great photos is the first step in taking the camera off automatic and in to manual mode.

It has the same Sony sensor found in the Nikon D7000, and I suspect it's similar to the highly regarded ones in the Sony Alpha 580 and Nex 5N.  As the reviewers at dpreview.com stated: \"At low ISO settings, the D5100 is on a par with the best of the competition, but at the higher ISO settings, it produces some of the best image quality that we've ever seen from an APS-C camera.\" Tests from DXOMark and reviews from several other sites confirm this assessment.I had a Canon t2i for about a week, but returned it in favor of this camera, and I'm very pleased with that decision.  That's not to say that the Canon t2i and t3i (which share the same sensor and have very similar image output) are necessarily sub par.  In many respects, they are superior, but it depends on what's most important to you and what you plan on doing with the camera.Here's a comparison between the D5100 and t2i/t3i, cameras that are competing for the same customers.D5100 ADVANTAGES- IMAGE QUALITY, especially at higher ISO's.  The camera has a larger sensor than the t3i and fewer pixels per square centimeter.  And when it has noise, it's more of the grainy type (which I prefer) than the blotchy, JPG artifact kind (which is what I got from the t2i).  Being able to use photos taken at 3200 and even 6400 ISO means faster shutter speeds at lower lights, which is essential for someone like me who has kids and wants to be able to take photos indoors without using the flash.  As I mentioned above, the D5100 likely has the best sensor of any APS-C camera currently available.- NICER KIT LENS.  The picture quality isn't necessarily better (although the t3i's larger sensor will show more of the imperfections of a lower quality lens than the D5100's and the kit lens is definitely a low quality lens compared to the other offerings in either the Canon or Nikon line), but the build at least feels better.  The movement on the zoom and focus rings were much less smooth on the t2i, especially when going from 24 to 18mm.  This might not matter for functionality and durability, but it bothered me quite a bit, and that matters since I'm not planning on getting a nicer kit lens for quite some time.- BETTER BUILD/FITS NICER IN HANDS.  This is very subjective, but the t2i's body felt cheap in my hands and was harder to hold. The t3i's body has been altered just a bit to improve the ease of holding it, but the plastic is the same as the t2i.  In addition, the spot on my t2i where you're supposed to put your right thumb would give a bit when I pressed on it and make a small sound.  I've read accounts of the t2i surviving drops and other mishaps that would have killed off lesser cameras.  I also like the feel of the rubber on the Nikon better.  Now, maybe how the plastic feels and whether it gives in a spot or two don't really matter as far as durability is concerned, but if you're using the camera regularly, you want to like how it feels in your hands.  I should add that many reviewers prefer the feel of the Canon over the Nikon, so on this point, you'll just have to try the cameras out yourself.- SHUTTER DURABILITY.  The D5100's shutter is tested at 100,000 cycles.  That doesn't mean that every D5100 will last that long, but at least they provide evidence that it should.  Canon doesn't do the same test (or at least post the results) for the t3i.  They claim it's because it's not a guarantee of shutter durability, but I've found websites that allow users to enter in when their shutter stops working or if it's continuing to work, and Nikons were usually superior than Canons on these tests, especially among the lower end models.- CUSTOMIZATION/POST-EDITING.  I feel like I was able to customize many more of the settings in the D5100 than the t2i, especially settings that affected how the camera processed the JPEGs (such as the color, sharpness, contrast, etc. of the image).  There are also a lot of options for editing photos in the camera after taking them, such as correcting for chromatic aberration and barrel distortion.  If you mostly use shareware photography software (like Picasa and Gimp), then having these in camera editing options might be important.- LONGER BATTERY LIFE.  I didn't have both cameras long enough to really say which had better batter life, but on paper, the D5100's battery is supposed to last 50% longer.CANON T2i/3i ADVANTAGES- FASTER AUTO FOCUS.  The auto focus was slighter faster in the t2i, especially in low light conditions.  I find that the D5100 has to have one of it's auto focus points on some sort of contrasting spot in low light conditions.  The D5100 does have an AF lamp, but it's so bright that it's not reasonable to use in settings with human subjects in the photo.- QUICK ACCESS TO SETTINGS.  Although the D5100 is very customizable, it can take several clicks to change the most basic settings, such as ISO, WB, etc.  How I wish they would use Canon's basic menu for quick access to camera settings.  It was a joy to change settings on the Canon. Not so much with the Nikon.  If you set your camera to auto-ISO (and the parameters you can set on the auto-ISO are awesome), you can't override the auto-ISO without going deep into one of the menus and turning it off.  ARGH!!!!  How frustrating!- BETTER INFO IN VIEWFINDER.  It's nearly impossible to tell what the ISO is in the D5100 looking in your optical viewfinder.  The best I can get it to do is to show me what the ISO is before I push the shutter release button half way down to auto focus.  For some reason, Nikon decided that photographers would rather know how many images can fit into the buffer (this affects how many photos you can take in a row in continuous shooting mode) than what the ISO is set at.  This is ridiculous, especially since there's plenty of room in the view finder to always show the ISO and the amount of space left in the buffer.  It didn't need to be an either/or choice.- SLIGHTLY BIGGER VIEWFINDER.  The t2i's viewfinder is slightly bigger, but it's not enough of a difference for me to really be able to tell like you can when going from the t3 (small viewfinder) to the t2i/3i or D5100.- SCREEN.  The screen on the t2i has more pixels and is slightly more sharper.  Plus, it's the same ratio as the sensor so when you review your photos, the photo fills the entire screen.  I'm not sure why other cameras don't also do this.  Also, I'm less worried about the t2i's screen getting scuffed up.  Part of his is  because I own a Canon G10, which has a similar screen as the t2i, and it hardly has any scratches (and none that affect what you see on the screen) even though I never used a cover on it.- VIDEO CONTROLS.  You can change the aperture while the video is recording.  The way the D5100 chooses the aperture is based on what it was set at in the last photo you took, which is odd.  Also, the D5100's microphone is too close to the lens, so in quiet videos, you hear every movement of the lens.  If video isn't that important to you, then this doesn't matter at all.- BETTER PLACEMENT OF SPIN DIAL or control wheel or whatever you call it.  If you're going to only have one spin dial, it should be by the shutter release button where you can turn it with your forefinger (as in the Canons) and not on the back for your thumb (as in the Nikons).  The reason for this is that there's much more room for buttons on the back, so with the spin dial by the shutter release button, you can hold down a bunch of different buttons on the back with your thumb while spinning the spin dial with your forefinger.  The reverse isn't true when the spin dial is on the back (there's room for only so many buttons on the top plate of the camera).  In other words, Canon has put their spin dial in the more optimal location.- The combination of quicker access to common shooting parameters, more useful info in the viewfinder, and a better placed spin dial mean that you're more easily able to change settings without ever taking your eye away from the viewfinder.  That's a very nice feature.- AUTO FOCUS MOTOR/LENS COMPATIBILITY.  Because the t2i has a built in auto focus motor, it can auto focus with lenses that don't have their own motors.  The same isn't true of the Nikon D5100.  However, many of the most common Nikon lenses have built in auto focus motors (they're the AF-S kind).  And their prices aren't that much different from those of Canon.  Another thing to consider is whether you plan on buying more lenses during the life of your camera. At most, I think I'll get one of the cheaper 50mm lenses ($200 for the AF-S one, $120 for the non-AF-S, which means manual focus on the D5100), so this didn't concern me too much.WHAT'S NOT ON THE LIST?- MEGAPIXELS.  Anything above 8 megapixels is plenty big for even 8X10 photos.  I'm not planning on doing shoots for magazine spreads, so having 16 or 18 megapixels only matters to me to the extent that it affects image quality.  If cramming more pixels means lower image quality, especially in low light situations, then I don't want those extra megapixels.- FLIP OUT SCREEN.  I almost consider this a gimmick.  I realize it's useful for video work and there's a convenience factor to it when taking photos of objects down low or from up above, but it seems like it could be more of a liability than a benefit--by having the flip out screen, you've just added an additional joint to your machine that could easily break if pressure were applied the wrong way when the screen is extended out.  On the other hand, maybe being able to store your camera with the screen facing in might protect it, but the screen is most vulnerable when you're using the camera, and usually, you'll have the screen facing out when using it.  In sum, I'd rather pay $100 less than have the screen.- LIVE VIEW.  It's a wash.  The D5100 focuses faster, but takes much longer to actually take the photo after you push the shutter release button all the way down.  The t2i, on the other hand, takes forever to focus, but it at least takes the photo more quickly once your push the button.  In some ways, that gives the t2i the advantage, but I don't care that much for Live View, except in scenarios where I want to zoom in ten times and auto focus, but in those scenarios, speed of auto focus and shutter lag don't really matter.THE TOUGH CHOICEThe harder question to answer is whether the Nikon D5100 is preferable to the Canon t2i, which one can get new for $150 to $200 less.  You might think I would say yes, but I bought the D5100 refurbished with a 1 year warranty that covers damage from normal use.  The price was reduced to the point that it was close to that of the Canon t2i, so it made sense for me to go with the D5100, especially since I give a lot of weight to image quality in low light situations, and I like how the D5100 felt in my hands.  It took weeks for me to come to a decision, and I suppose it might take just as long or longer for you.On the bright side, both cameras are capable machines and surpass the top of the line DSLR's from not too long ago.  Both are going to produce quality images.  Both are part of a system with a large range of lenses at comparable prices.  It's just a matter of taste and weighing trade-offs.  One thing I have noticed in comparing Canon and Nikon is that Canon seems to fault on the side of higher megapixels while Nikon has been more concerned with image quality.  The difference isn't much, but I do think it's a difference.Well, best of luck in your decision!OVERALL RATINGOverall, I can only give the D5100 4 stars.  I wish I could give it 5, but after using it for a few days and realizing that I had quicker access to essential parameters (like turning off auto ISO or changing the shooting mode from single to continuous) in my old point and shoot, I can't give this camera 5 stars.  I suspect Nikon did this so that the semi-pros wouldn't buy the D5100 instead of the D7000, which has the same sensor and similar functions but much better manual controls, along with a better body (weather sealing) and an auto focus motor drive in the body.  I guess I could hope and wish that Nikon would do a firmware update to correct some of these problems (at least let me turn Auto-ISO off in one or two clicks, please!), but I'll be hoping and wishing in vain.MORE REVIEWSFor other comparisons of these two cameras, check out DigitalReview.ca, SnapSport, and DXOMark", "Date": "December 15, 2011"}, {"Title": "I Didn't Want To Like This D5100", "Author": "Steven A.

I learned how to take pictures, luckily by hanging out on Hollywood studio sets. I'm a longtime Nikon camera buff who also loves different film stocks.

So after years of not wanting to go to digital, I decided to buy me a decent DSLR.Like many old guys who loved their built like a tank Nikons, there was much to hate about the new Nikons. Too much plastic, cheap build, blah, blah, blah.Yes, the latest DSLR cameras are fragile, but that's still my only complaint. In every way, the capabilities of these new cameras will win you over.  If I could have owned a camera twenty years ago that could shot 4 pics a second, lets me see the pictures instantly, lets me crop and color correct on the spot, lets me show my client what I already have shot, was completely silent when focusing, battery life that lasts,  brackets automatically and shots high def video, all for less than $600 I would have laughed. $600 was for just one lens, let alone the camera body.But this D5100 does alot right. The picture quality is astounding. In the great Nikon tradition, the pictures are sharp and the contrast of each image is wonderful. The flexibility of this camera is amazing. I can still put my old AF lenses on the camera, courtesy of a lens mount created in 1959. The only thing is you have to focus those old lenses manually. No big deal there. I even wanted to hate the new lens cover designs and lens hoods, but they all do the job and while plastic, it's pretty darn good plastic.The 18-55mm lens is awesome for a variety of shooting situations, much better than the standard, and pretty useless 50mm they used to give you with most camera body purchases.As a result of this camera, I'm getting back into photography with a good deal of excitement.

Harrison", "ReviewID": "R7B782JHWHWI2", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I have been a member of the Nikon family for over 30 years, initially with film cameras. My first digital was a d60 in 2008, then I moved to a d3100 in 2010. I was very pleased with that but wanted to move up to a higher level product at a reasonable price level. I read all the reviews (including ones for other manufacturers' cameras) but in the end it was clear to me: the d5100 had everything I wanted and needed for the level of photography that I'm at and where I am likely to remain (by choice). I don't earn my living with photography, but do consider myself an advanced hobbyist who really enjoys taking pictures of people, events and landscapes for my own amusement and my friends' amazement. The d5100 does all that and more for a great price.In particular, what I like about it includes the better (than the d3100) sensor, the additional shooting modes that really increase my capacity to create great pictures, the easy-to-use controls, the ability to use an infra-red remote (that should have been on the d3100), and the light weight. I use three lenses: the kit 18-55mm, the fixed f1.8 35mm, and the heavier 70-300mm zoom, which do a great job on sharpness and clarity of the images.Since I moved from a d3100 it did not take long to know how to use the d5100. For me, shooting in the P mode generally works the best, and I mostly use matrix metering and AF-A mode. The built-in flash is good but I prefer to use the very capable but (relatively) inexpensive SB-400 external flash unit. Auto ISO also works well for me, although I do play with it sometimes but find it's best not to go over 3200.While I am aware of the old and true saying that people take pictures, not cameras, I would add to that that having a wonderful camera with the features of the d5100 really helps this particular person take great pictures!I am very pleased with the d5100 which combines an excellent mix of reasonable cost, ease of use, and very high quality images.", "Date": "February 20, 2012"}, {"Title": "Excellent camera for a variety of users", "Author": "pm444 \"pm444\"", "ReviewID": "R2DMAFTGWX7X8L", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This camera has been an outstanding upgrade from my Nikon D60, which was my first dSLR after having used point-and-shoot cameras.  The D60 was a great camera entry-level dSLR when I bought it in 2008, but the more I used it, the more I became aware of its limitations.  The biggest issue I had with the D60 was its low-light performance.  Even with an add-on flash and reasonably good ambient lighting, there were too many indoor shots that simply didn't look very good.  Cranking up the ISO helped with exposure, but it introduced too much digital noise.  When a camera's inherent technological limitations are keeping you from getting the shots you want, it's time to look at alternatives.I looked at both the D5100 and the Canon EOS Rebel T3i 18 MP CMOS Digital SLR Camera and DIGIC 4 Imaging with EF-S 18-55mm f/3.5-5.6 IS Lens, because they are closely matched in terms of price, features, and performance.  Both cameras get very good reviews.  You can Google \"Nikon D5100 and Canon T3i\" and see for yourself:  most review sites give them almost identical overall scores, citing certain strengths and advantages for each camera. I was considering the Canon because I only had my Nikon 18-55mm kit lens and my Nikon SB-400 flash, so I didn't have a huge investment in the Nikon line-up.  While the list price of the two cameras is similar, it was much easier to find really good discount prices on the T3i, and there are also more options for buying the T3i body with several different kit lens options (as of this writing, Nikon is only offering the D5100 with the same 18-55mm kit lens that I had from my D60).However, there was one thing about the T3i that I didn't like.  The main control on the back of the T3i (Nikon calls it the multi-selector;  I'm not sure what Canon calls it) is placed lower on the camera than on the D5100, which means that you have to move your thumb down to access it.  Ergonomically, this didn't work as well for me as Nikon's more central placement of this control.  The advantage of Canon's placement is that it leaves space for a bigger thumb grip at the upper right corner of the camera.  However, since the multi-selector is the primary way you access the camera's menus to adjust settings, I preferred Nikon's placement.  This is such a subjective decision that it's important for a buyer to go to a retail store, handle both cameras, and see for him or herself.The other thing that made me choose the Nikon is my goal to eventually upgrade to the Nikon 18-200mm lens.  As far as I can tell, there is no equivalent lens in the Canon line-up.I also looked at the Nikon D7000 16.2MP DX-Format CMOS Digital SLR with 3.0-Inch LCD (Body Only), but at $1,199 for just the body, I couldn't justify the expense.  Besides the fact that it's almost twice as much as the D5100, I still prefer the smaller size and lighter weight of the D5100, which has a form factor that is almost identical to the D60.  If you routinely use longer lenses or prefer a larger camera, the D7000 is very impressive and would be an excellent choice.I've been very happy with the D5100. It offers higher ISOs than the D60 and you can use them without adding noise to your images.  It performs much better in low-light shooting situations, which was my main reason for upgrading in the first place.  Even with flash, my indoor photos are more evenly exposed, without the washed-out foregrounds and dark backgrounds that I was getting with the D60.  The menu system is similar to the D60, but I find it more intuitive and easier to navigate.  I also like the controls and buttons better on the D5100.One major upgrade that the D5100 offers over the D60 is high-definition video recording.  The D60 had no video recording at all.  I have only used this feature on the D5100 for a few quick tests, but for anyone interested in video, this is a major addition.The D5100 also has an articulated LCD display, which is larger than the D60's.  The Live View feature allows you to shoot photos using the LCD instead of the viewfinder.  This feature might be handy if you wanted to shoot with the camera above or below your own position (for example, taking photos over the heads of a crowd).  Instead of aiming and hoping you get your shot, you can use the articulated LCD to view what you are shooting.  The same is true if you want to shoot with the camera aiming directly down.  Instead of leaning over the camera to look through the viewfinder, and perhaps casting your shadow on the image, you can use the LCD to compose your shot.In Live View, the LCD also allows you to view the effects of various white balance settings on a shot you're about to take.  I haven't found that the white balance as shown on the LCD before shooting is exactly the same as what I get after I shoot, but it is helpful to give you an idea of what to expect.Several things to keep in mind if you buy this camera:1.  Update the firmware, as there are reported issues with the camera having trouble with certain SanDisk cards.2.  Buy a good quality UV filter to protect your lens.  Do not skimp on this.  B + W, Nikon, and Hoya get good reviews.3.  Get a good memory card.  Costs for these have come down, so I'd get a class 10 card that's at least 8 GB, in case you end up shooting any video. If you do a lot of video, you'll want at least a 16 GB card, probably even larger.4.  Consider buying a spare battery.  Live View uses more battery power, and you don't want to be limited in using it.  The extra battery will cost about $50, but it's worth the peace of mind knowing that you can go out for an all-day shoot with battery back-up ready in case you need it.5.  Buy one or more of the books that provide detailed, illustrated directions on getting the most out of the camera.  Nikon provides a fairly good, basic manual in printed form, but the complete Nikon manual is only provided as a PDF on a CD, or to download (also readable on an iPad or iPhone, which is convenient).  The Nikon manuals are much better than the ones that came with the D60, but the third-party books that deal specifically with this camera are even better.  I recommend the following:Nikon D5100: From Snapshots to Great Shots by Rob Sylvan. This book starts off with 10 tips suggested by the author to get you off to a good start, including some changes to the camera's default settings, and then takes the reader through a series of chapters that focus on one topic at a time.  Each chapter ends with assignments that are designed to help you actually apply what you have learned.Nikon D5100 For Dummies  Ignore the title, the book itself is very good, and contains more detailed information than the book by Sylvan.  Think of it as a reliable reference to go to when you need more specifics than Sylvan provides.David Busch has two books about the D5100, one a small field guide that would fit in a camera bag: David Busch's Compact Field Guide for the Nikon D5100, and the other a full-sized and very comprehensive guide: David Busch's Nikon D5100 Guide to Digital SLR Photography.  These are both very good, too.You can preview these books on Amazon or download samples to your Kindle or iPad, so take a look before you make a decision.In summary, the Nikon D5100 is an excellent entry-level dSLR that offers features and performance that simply were not available at this price just two or three years ago.  If you are ready to make the move from point-and-shoot photography, this would be a great camera.  You could set it on Auto and you will get excellent results just aiming and shooting, though you will want to move past using Auto after you've had a chance to get to know the camera better.If you have an older dSLR that lacks some of the advanced features and capabilities of this camera, you will be pleasantly surprised at how far the technology has come.  In my case, the improved ease-of-use prompted me to learn more about the camera and I'm now much more comfortable making adjustments as I shoot, instead of relying on the camera to do all my thinking for me.Highly recommended.", "Date": "January 6, 2012"}, {"Title": "Awesome camera", "Author": "Mikey likes it", "ReviewID": "R2FLW7N3O75UKQ", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I looked at all of the entry to mid-level dslrs and the D5100 best fit my needs as an \"experienced beginner\". Initially, I was a bit hesitant, because I was afraid I'd outgrow it rather quickly, so I also bought a D7000 intending to return one of them (I know, this is sometimes frowned upon, but Amazon's excellent return privileges are there for a reason).They're both great cameras and you can't go wrong with either. But I've decided to keep the D5100 for a number of reasons, including:- To my eyes, image quality is virtually indistinguishable between the 2 cameras, and I engaged in some serious pixel-peeping while reaching this conclusion. Both use the same Sony sensor. Where the D7k probably has an edge is with sports and capturing moving subjects in low light (neither of which I had the chance to shoot).- Both of the D7000's I tried had backfocusing problems due to faulty bodies. What are the odds of that?- The D7000 overexposes in bright/high contrast scenes, requiring -ev adjustment to prevent loss of detail from highlight clipping. Some may not mind this, but I think that, in its default state, the camera shouldn't overexpose to the point of losing detail, unless you're shooting in full manual mode and have chosen the wrong settings. Sometimes you don't have time to set ev comp to take advantage of a great photo op.- My trusty D5100 has had no problems whatsoever. Focus is tack sharp. Everything works and it's been an absolute pleasure to use. I also don't recall reading reports of any known problems or design flaws with the D5100, unlike the D7000.- The small form factor and light weight of the 5100 make it great for traveling. The articulating screen can also come in handy. It's well-made and the mostly-plastic build isn't a problem. Besides, the D7000 uses magnesium alloy only on the back and top (as if it was used more for show than for real ruggedness). The rest of the body shell is plastic, which is fine for most of us amateurs. If you want real ruggedness, you need to step up to a pro model.- The 5100 is often referred to as a beginner's camera, but it's actually capable of most of the things even an advanced user would need. Some of the secondary essentials (WB, release mode, bracketing) are in menus, but they're quick to access. All of the key functions, however (aperture, shutter speed, exposure comp, flash mode, AE/AF lock, ISO) are controllable via buttons (ISO can be assigned to the function button) and once you get used to the layout, it becomes second nature. There's a plethora of settings, and it *is* a camera one can grow with and hold onto for awhile. The D7000, otoh, has lots of features that I (and perhaps many other amateurs) would rarely or never use.- Being my first dslr, I didn't have any old Nikkor AFS lenses and I don't plan to buy many more lenses beyond the three that I already have. So the internal focus motor of the D7000 wasn't of any value to me. The D7000's larger, brighter, 100% coverage viewfinder is missed, but I can live without it. The D7000's glass prism adds a fair amount of weight.- Cost wasn't an issue, but I don't exactly mind saving $400 especially when I'm getting the same image quality. To me, the 5100 was a better value. The money is better spent on lenses. Furthermore, given the short life cycle of electronic products, it doesn't make sense to invest in a more expensive body with extra non-essential (to me) features, since there will be interesting developments in the next couple of years (e.g. advancement in mirrorless cam technology and lens selection), tempting me to upgrade.I'd recommend buying the D5100 body only, passing on the 18-55 kit lens in favor of the 35mm 1.8. Then add a 16-85VR and 70-300VR as budget permits. These lenses are all super sharp and should cover almost any shot that comes up. The 18-105 is a good, cheaper alternative to the 16-85.", "Date": "July 29, 2011"}, {"Title": "Black Images", "Author": "Mark Maze \"Mark\"", "ReviewID": "R205VY7P519T8U", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "Not recommended.

I know nothing about photography beyond what I read in tutorials and guides. Of course, reading about photography won't make anyone good at it. I shot some good pictures in the past using a Panasonic point and shoot, but I gave the camera away as it was just sitting around. Recently, I received a gift card and I thought I should buy a decent SLR, and take up this hobby again.I am a little concerned by people reporting problems with the shutter, resulting into black images. But because I bought a reconditioned camera, Nikon may have actually fixed the problem before selling this piece again. At least that's the hope! I bought it despite the concern, but overly concerned people should just go with the brand new version that comes with 1 year warranty. Reconditioned ones come with a 90-day warranty from Nikon. OneCall, my seller on Amazon gives a 30 day return warranty. I took one star off for this very reason, which is not necessarily a problem as of now, but the concern will hang over my head all the time.The camera is quite small in size as compared to some DSLR cameras we see. It's actually just as big as my previous mega zoom point and shoot Lumix DMC-FZ35. I am sure people with smaller palms will absolutely love this fact. People with big-to-humongous palm sizes may find the grip a little too small, though.Right away, after recording a few pictures, I noticed how much better the photos looked than a point-and-shoot I owned. Even though we already know this, it was satisfying to actually discover it myself to justify the upgrade. I also tried the manual modes (PSAM), and I was happy with what I saw. The Nikon on-screen menus can be and will be overwhelming for starters like me, but I hope to not give up. The body's construction, neck strap, the eye piece, the screen, and the 18-55 VR lens supplied seem to be of pretty high quality for $500. But of course, some people will quickly outgrow this lens, and since I heard the lenses make up for most of the DSLR experience, more money will eventually be spent in this department.One tip for beginners. Please make sure you do not buy a low-speed memory card. Always shoot for at least a class 10 SDHC card which is at least 8GB. It makes all the difference in the world when working with a DSLR camera that records big sized raw images. And if you care about the product, please buy a well-protective camera bag. Zeikos has a bag on sale on Amazon under $10 that's got good reviews. I bought the same.Lastly, please use great care, and refer the manual when fitting the lens for the first time. You don't want it to break or fall on the floor accidentally. Also please handle the battery cover with care. No it is not flimsy, but I found the opening mechanism prone to be put unnecessary pressure on until you figure it out.Enjoy the toy! Please comment if you like the review and find it helpful.

Flynn \"Bear\"", "ReviewID": "R1W77XHYK36CTB", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "There are a lot of great reviews of this product out there. A lot of highly technical reviews and some very basic. For me the decision to purchase this camera came down to a couple of things I thought I would highlight here. I am not a professional in any sense of the word. I love to take photos and wanted a camera that would allow me to take great pictures and also allow me to think outside the \"auto\" box and shoot in manual, changing my settings, etc.Basically, I have been torn between Nikon and Canon for some time. This camera, in general, got better reviews than its Canon competitor (the T3i Rebel). Ultimately, books, countless websites and forums have debated this topic so I won't get into that. I could bore you with technical details, but sometimes simpler is better. If you are not a pro and just want to take some fun quality pictures, this Review is for you. Not only was this camera rated highly in every single review I read, but after researching for MONTHS, I ultimately bought this Nikon. After owning it about 8 months now, here is what I know:1) It feels / Looks goodThe camera feels as though it is built solidly and I love the way it feels in my hand. It doesn't feel cheaply made and has a good weight to it.2) I love the scene modes / effects modesThis camera has several several scene modes like the simpler point and shoot cameras including pet, night, beach, party/indoor, sunset, dusk/dawn, candlelight, autumn, food, night portrait, and blossom. Whew that's a lot of modes! Now there's nothing more intimidating than handing this camera to a friend and asking them to take a picture of you and someone else. They are going to look at you as though you've just asked them to climb the empire state building...with one hand! But these scene modes allow you to quickly identify your scene and then shoot--or helps someone not camera inclined take a better shot. In fact, I use these modes a lot and they allow my husband (who previously ran when he heard the word camera) to take amazing photos as well. As if that were not enough, this camera also includes some effects modes including fisheye, color outline, selective color, Miniature, color sketch, and some picture control modes that let you edit photos right from the camera (risky but useful).3) The pictures are fabulous!Okay I promised not to get technical on you, but overall, the pictures the camera takes are very good. I upgraded to this from an older Canon Xti and I can tell you that the sharpness for your common photo sizes like 8 x 10, 4 x 6, and 5 x 7 will be sharp and clear... As long as you focused correctly. I found the shutter to respond quickly when taking sports shots, and the frame rate is about 4 fps which is pretty good.I should mention that the camera does not have an in body focus motor which means you will need to use lenses which supply a focus motor if you like auto focus. This will not be an issue if you are using the 18-55 mm lense that you can purchase with or comes as a part of your camera package. This may affect you if you are using old lenses. But keep in mind the old lenses will work, but you will have to focus the shot yourself.Also, the noise of your photos will increase the higher your ISO. But overall, there is a good compromise at higher ISOs between sharpness and noise---which basically means you can still take a good photo in low light wih this camera!Keep in mind that you can shoot in RAW mode (for those of us who really like to tweak our photos and get technical) but is perfectly fine shooting in JPG mode which you can edit as you wish or easily upload as is to the web.4) Movies are so-soMovies are only okay. For me not a huge deal as I bought this to take photos... But movies are easy to make although I have heard that people have complained about sound clarity issues. The output is in .mov format which is nice. But honestly, I have come to enjoy making small movies and have not had sound issues.If I had any complaint about this camera is that the menus are difficult and non intuitive to navigate. One you familiarize yourself with it, however, it becomes a non issue... But for me it was a steep learning curve coming from Canon's easy to navigate menus.Overall, this is a great camera. Where it really shines is in its overall performance and picture quality. I especially love those scenes which are not included on similar other cameras including the Canon which is ultimately why I decided on this camera. I also realized that the key to good photos lies not really in the camera so much as the person behind the camera and the lenses used to capture the shot. Get yourself a lens or two (or buy it with the 18-55mm lens which is a great overall entry lens) and get this camera. Then go out there and have some fun!

Everyone seems to agree that this is probably the best APS-C sized sensor out there right now (shared with the more expensive D7000).

Initially, I did want the extra controls & perceived build quality & built-in AF of the D90/D7000, but the articulating screen and the awesome photos coming out of the D5100 are just beautiful (btw, Lightroom is useful no matter which DLSR you choose to buy).

Makes family group photos a breeze!Great LCD. To be fair, I haven't actually seen the LCD screen on the D3100 but I had read that it wasn't all it could have been. The screen on the D5100 is fantastic. Of course nothing beats seeing your photos on a nice big computer monitor or printed out, but the LCD is a great tool for previewing photos as you go, and for me, learning as I go! I can critique myself immediately.Filters. People with DSLRs already may not be enthused by this, but as a first time DSLR owner, I'm excited about the different filters that are available to me. My wishlist is growing!So far, the menus and everything have been easy to use, but currently, I am just continually snapping away, and I can get to the technical mumbo jumbo later. I feel like this is a great camera for beginners, but has all the advanced features and quality that I can really grow into and learn to use as I hone my photography skills. Framing and composing pictures in a DSLR is such a different experience than in a point-and-shoot, and the depth of field is amazing. I can't say enough good things about this camera. I was worried it would be too heavy to really carry around (I am never without my pocket point-and-shoot) but that isn't the case, and for the amazing photos I'm getting, I'm willing to carry it with me anywhere!(Also, for other first time DSLR owners, I did upgrade my little 2gb SD card to a 16 gb class 10 card (as recommended by Nikon)).All-in-all an amazing camera purchase and I could not be happier!", "Date": "June 30, 2011"}, {"Title": "Phenomenal Camera - Short Review", "Author": "Sam", "ReviewID": "R2FLLZLZHUR9ZR", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "For starters, I have had several point-and-shoot cameras with a varying degree of satisfaction.  I took photography in the 90s, so my last SLR was a fully manual Pentax P3N.  That said, I understood aperture, depth of field, shutter speed, light readings, etc., but the last time I used those words was 14 years ago, and required multiple devices and a lot of time in the darkroom.I was about to get the Canon T3, but decided to wait for the D5100 to come out - it was well worth the wait.Overall, it is the perfect balance of tech-nerd features and amateur ease-of-use.  Every day I learn a new trick, technique, and feature.  I will note that the paper manual is pretty slim, but the disk is better.  Nikon's website is the best.  For example, nowhere in the manual does it explain how to use HDR mode - it was grayed out for me and I could not turn it on - it turned out the camera was smarter than me.  Because I was in the wrong mode, and inside a dark house, there was no way HDR would work, so it wasn't going to let me bother trying!  One you learn to navigate the menus, it becomes second nature.Effects - the effects modes were what initially caught my eye - I had seen the Dpreview.com \"preview\" and was intrigued by the \"miniature\" and \"selective color\" effects.  They work great, with practice (especially selective color - it took me a few tries to figure it out) but now they are second nature.  The results are spectacular.  The other effects are cool, too - they function as advertised and are pleasing and easy.Scenes - I had \"scene\" modes on other point-and-shoots, and was never pleased.  The opposite is true here.  The D5100 has a TON of scene modes, and all have been phenomenal.  I try to avoid using the flash as much as possible, but certain photos require it - the D5100 scene modes consistently help to create balanced and sharp photos regardless of the circumstances.Video - all I can say is \"wow\"... at first I didn't \"get\" the quality of video...then I watched some raw video on my 50\" 1080p tv...so good.  The focus works well, it is fast and accurate.  I have not used all the shooting modes, but I was impressed by the cinematographic quality of the images when using a large aperture and manual focus.  I did not expect to have the urge to make movies, but I find myself playing with it more and more, then editing on iMovie.Overall, I would recommend this to any amateur photographer looking for a tool that offers amazing flexibility and limitless creative options.  With a little bit of practice, and a good basic book on photography (I use Understanding Exposure, 3rd Edition: How to Shoot Great Photographs with Any Camera) you will find that you can make pro-quality photographs with this amazing camera.", "Date": "May 3, 2011"}, {"Title": "Natural progression from the world of digital megazoom", "Author": "Annie Riley", "ReviewID": "R3CHV3TD18PQJZ", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "For the last year or so I have been pushing my Panasonic Lumix DMC-FZ8 to the max. I just wasn't achieving the level of quality and professionalism I needed. I knew it was not possible as long as I skirted the world of the dSLR for fear of the price tag and all that. But when I had the chance, I took the plunge into that tantalizingly beautiful world, and I have not looked back.Except when my 18-55mm lens doesn't zoom in as close as was used to with my Lumix. ;) But the depth of field, high quality, manual options, and wonderful speed of my d5100 more than make up for that. I'll just get a bigger lens some day.Also, a note for those of you who may be doing what I did and going back and forth (x1,000,000...) between the 3100 and 5100: If you're coming from the digital point-and-shoot or megazoom world, any dSLR will be better than what you've got! The 3100 is an excellent camera, and you would probably not notice much of a difference between the two*. But if your budget can handle it, I would definitely recommend the 5100. The rotating LCD is wonderful, those extra couple of megapixels are nice, and it is fast. There are some other pluses, but I haven't fully explored them all yet.Well, I think this turned out more like a blog entry than a review, but hopefully someone out there will benefit from it. And that it will encourage the step into dSLR photography.THE END.*This wisdom was imparted to me by a very kind lady in the photography department at my local Best Buy who was not out to sell me the highest-priced camera but rather to find out what I needed and help me find it.

The display screen went black though the physical mechanism still worked.  The photos taken are all pure black, as if the light sensor burned out but everything else worked.  I haven't dropped it or subjected it to any extreme conditions.  I was in the middle of shooting about 20 pix when it just went black.  I've sent it back to Nikon for repair.When I bought the Nikon D70, it broke down, too, after about a year of use.  Nikon repaired a defective circuit board for free, though I had to pay $35 in shipping charges.  It took about six weeks to get the camera back.I've been using Nikons for forty years.  The film Nikons were tanks, which held up well for long periods.  These two digital SLR Nikons are a different story.  They broke down even with gentler care and encased in silicone armor.  I think Nikon has some sort of quality control problem with its digital cameras.  It's very unusual for an electronic product to fail within the first year and incredible that two would fail in a row.  I can't trust Nikon anymore to deliver a reliable product that I know will be there when I'm taking once in a lifetime images.

I've been wanting to learn for years rather than to keep shelling out money for someone else to take mediocre pictures of my children.  I did a lot of research and spoke with a lot of people before deciding on this.  My total budget was $1000 for camera, lenses, case, cards, and software.  I picked Nikon over Canon after trying them out in the store solely based on how it felt in my hand. The menu on the Nikon felt more intuitive as did the button placement.  I also tend to think of Nikon as \"The\" camera people.  The package I put together was this camera body with the 55-200mm kit lens, the Nikon 35mm f/1.8G AF-S DX lens, 1 Transcend 16 GB Class 6 SDHC Flash Memory Card, BUILT Cargo Camera Bag- Fiery Orange, Medium, and photoshop CS5 free trial then CS6 free trial then monthly.  I also spend a lot of time online learning how to use my camera and how to edit my photos.  What I love about this camera:  It's easy to use, all the lenses I have hold their value and can be resold or move with me to my next camera.  This camera takes beautiful photos and is fairly forgiving as I play around with the settings.  I've been taking it everywhere and have loved the pictures I have been able to take. My oldest graduated from high school this year and there was a photographer hired to get photos of the kids crossing the stage. The one taken of my son was awful.  I had my camera with the 55-200mm lens on and got great shots of him and his friends from across the stadium.  I've even had people ask me to take pictures of events for my kids school!  That's more likely because I alwasy have my camera but nonetheless, I'm finding this camera an excellent camera to learn on.  I can see using this for years before I would feel the need to upgrade. There is so much to learn and enough manual settings to really be able to play around and figure out what I like.  If I had a larger budget, I would have gone for the D7000 just because that seems to be a level I could stay with indefinitely but on my budget, I'm very happy with my purchase!

The water was immediately shaken out and the camera placed under a hair dryer at low heat for 2 hours and then placed in a plastic bin with a pack of No Damp moisture absorber purchased at WalMart.

I knew the video would be a great feature (it's great!). I knew it would represent the best value in Nikon's DSLRs in a very long time (the D7000's legendary sensor crammed into a smaller, friendlier body with a flippable screen at half the price!).What I didn't expect is how much I'd love the tactile feel of the buttons, the humongous screen, the smartly-designed and readable menus. I didn't expect that I could let it run free on Aperture Priority with no corrections and it would get exceptional shots every time. And I sure didn't expect that it could auto-correct distortion!The 5100 is a fantastic camera. It's absolutely everything you need to take great photos. It's lighter than a D7000, shoots better pictures than anything in its class, and is blazing-fast to start up, to focus, to bracket, and to save. It automatically corrects for distortion (NO Canon camera does this, to my knowledge). It has an incredible Auto-ISO feature (and can take usable photos at ISO 6400!). And its Raw files have so much latitude, it's like you've bracketed every shot.So what are the downsides?- You should already know that it doesn't autofocus with lenses that don't have their own motors. It doesn't have a focus motor, like the D3100 and D40 before it. (For people who are only going to buy 1 or 2 lenses, this is no big deal)- The battery life isn't great: about 620 shots. I know that sounds like a lot, but it's really not. My D40 (and all pro-level cameras) tend to last for a few thousand shots, and that's putting it lightly. During a 3-month term at college I charged my D40 ONCE. So, to mitigate the problem with the 5100, I bought a second battery: expensive but necessary. Just factor that into the cost.-The color is true to life and fairly accurate, but I miss the warm, glowy tone of the D40. The 5100 tends to render greens too \"neon\" and struggles with purples.-The \"ADL\" (adaptive dynamic lighting) feature will make your shots look spectacular, but it IS ONLY MEANT FOR JPEG. If you use it on a Raw file, the resulting file will come out much too dark because only Nikon's proprietary software can \"read\" the ADL instructions, and no one uses Nikon's software because it's terrible. Don't use this feature if you shoot Raw.-It is often not useful to have this many megapixels. The resulting files are bigger than they need to be and more cumbersome to fling around. This is hardly a real concern, but it does bear mentioning. Especially in Raw, you should be prepared to use 32-64 GB of storage space a month, minimum. Some of you may need a faster computer, or at least more RAM, to step up to images this big.- The screen tends to get coated with moisture and grime because it is pushed very far off of the camera body to accomodate the swivel mechanism. This means that with your eye to the viewfinder, you will undoubtedly cause a hazy buildup of sweat/heat/rubbing, which you'll need to wipe off pretty frequently.- The camera has absolutely no idea how much battery is left when using Live View. It often says the battery is about to die, and then lasts for a hundred more shots.- The \"record\" button is mounted in a ridiculous place and is often not triggered when you need it to. It would have been better to have a switch so you knew by feel if it was on or off (most of Nikon's other cameras do this).- OK, OK, it doesn't feel as light or effortlessly designed as the D40. It also doesn't have that icy-crisp shutter sound. I've started to realize that nothing ever will.All in all, there's hardly any reason not to get the D5100.

I could not have been more pleased with anything else for the price and quality of this camera, it was honestly the best $649 dollars I have ever spent. I plan on buying s second unit and converting it specifically for IR photography, more so I can capture crisp IR images, I must say that this camera takes very nice IR photographs just not at normal frame rates that you are accustom to with visible light photography. If you are at all hesitant on purchasing this because you feel it might be to much camera for you, you should reconsider.

Barnett", "ReviewID": "R1H4CAGZCM8LG1", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This is easily the finest camera that I've owned and I've owned some good cameras hailing back to the Minolta SRT-201. I seldom use the viewfinder and instead tend to use the high contrast and very sharp monitor built into the camera. Focus is quick and accurate with the kit lens. Pictures are bright and color is very accurate.Vibration Reduction is better than I expected. With the camera on my tripod and VR off, I can tap the tripod and see the image resonate with the vibration in the tripod. With VR on, there is no discernable shake even with the 70-300mm lens on full zoom. Quite amazing actually. I can hear the VR mechanism working but it's not loud, just quietly working it's magic.With AF and VR on, it takes a second to take an image since everything has to stabilize before the picture is taken. Turning them off and doing manual focus allows a much faster process per picture.I also purchased a Tamron 70-300mm lens and all features work perfectly with this camera, both AF and VR (which Tamron calls VC) work pretty much the same on it and the kit lens.It's worth every penny. I'd buy it again in a heartbeat. This camera makes ME smile.1 Month Update: (June 27)We have a couple of thousand shots out of this amazing camera now.About 1500 images out in nature with the 300mm zoom all the way out capturing birds in flight, nesting and doing what birds do. Sure we throw a lot of them out. Every photographer does. The image is good, it's just not of anything worth keeping. This is not a camera problem. This is a photographer problem. Using the camera more is the answer.In the last two weeks, we've experimented with an older fully manual 55mm Micro-Nikkor-P lens with the 27.5mm extension tube. It takes a little experimentation to get the exposure but the images are exquisite. I never expected to be able to put a 40 year old Nikon lens on this camera but I did and with the camera set to manual you can use this ultra modern camera very similarly to how we took pictures 40 years ago. The manufacturing quality of those old lenses is amazing. There are tens of thousands of them on the used market and available relatively inexpensively. I have just over $100 in the used macro lens and extension tube and that gives us 2:1, 1:1 to .5:1 macro ability with a focal distance measured in inches out to infinity. The Micro-Nikkor lenses have legendary Nikon quality and performance and it's not at all lost on this camera.If you've always wanted to get those close up macro shots of bugs or flowers breaking into bloom, don't shy away from those old Nikkor lenses in manual mode. They take wonderful pictures with the D5100.As a bonus, my wife wasn't really solid with learning the relationship between shutter speed, f stop and ISO until a week with the manual lens on. Now she's all over it. Because you HAVE TO LEARN to make it work at all. Depth of field now makes sense to her and now she knows how to achieve it. Or not.3 Month Update: (August 3)Just shot a wedding in Duluth and the north shore of Lake Superior. (not as the paid photographer) Two days, rehearsal, rehearsal dinner campfire/cabin, wedding and reception. Took 430 shots. Left the camera on automatic 99% of the time. About 20 shots were really great photos. About 15 of them were motion blurred, badly focused or missed target. The rest of them were acceptable shots. Nearly all of the motion blurred were from the Tamron 70-300 in full zoom. Half of those, the subject moved in the frame.Overall I'd rate it a success. Two of the photos were real winners. Pictures that told a story and caught emotion.I can't fault the camera or lenses for anything. They just worked. Very happy with the setup.I had an external flash on, the Nikon SB-400 AF Speedlight. I also had the diffuser for it from Stofen, the OM-400. This flash was really not up to the task for a big room like a church. Thankfully the room was well lit. For smaller rooms around 30 x 20 or less, the flash and diffuser was excellent. The room really needs a white ceiling for the diffuser to work properly since it directs a lot of light up at a 45 degree angle. I took nearly all of the church interior pictures hand held with no flash and let the VR lenses do their magic. I got a lot of good shots from the balcony with the 70-300 lens and the camera balanced on the railing.Outdoor pictures near dusk in low outdoor lighting came out way better than any camera I've had in the past. Until it got dark enough to simply not support picture taking, the dusk pictures pretty much look like the daytime pictures. The D5100 really is amazing in low light conditions.Battery life was very good. I went through two batteries in the camera. I'm sure the external flash helped battery life. I can't speak to battery life in the flash since I recharged them once that night and can't tell how far they were run down. The flash always recharged VERY quickly.Wrap Up:Cameras take images. Photographers take pictures. The Nikon D5100 is way more capable than most of us. I have yet to demand something from it that it hasn't delivered with excellence. With this much capability, we can work on and improve our abilities. And with digital images being micro-pennies vs dollars in old school terms, it's an inexpensive way to get an education in photography.And you're going to end up with some great pictures in the process.Get it.", "Date": "May 21, 2012"}, {"Title": "Great camera for the Point-and-shoot photographer upgrading", "Author": "Eleanor Faye Lewis \"appy20\"", "ReviewID": "R22AOEK9LA9S7G", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This review is not going to cover the specs and advanced features of this camera because others have done that with far greater finesse than I could ever manage. If that is what you need or want, then please move on to the next review.  I am going to focus on the advantages for someone moving from a point and shoot to this DSLR camera. I have seen comments posted on the web from serious photographers who question why a rank amateur would want anything more than a point and shoot and would like to address those concerns.  First of all, this is a teaching camera.  You can learn from it and your skills will advance, no matter how humble the skills are in the beginning.  In the process of learning, the camera is idiot proof so you will still get great pictures in spite of your lack of sophistication.  Secondly, if you have a home with poor lighting, this camera will do far better than any point and shoot that I have ever used.  Thirdly, if you don't want to win photography awards but it is still important to you to accurately capture the beauty of whatever it is that you love, this is a great camera. I love to take pictures of my cats, dogs and wildlife on my rural property.  This camera, in very bad lighting, accurately takes pictures of my cats' beautiful eyes.  I don't need fancy filters, lenses, flashes or lighting.  The color is not off and you don't get red eye, blue eye or no eye.  I don't really have to do a whole lot of advanced adjusting to accomplish this.  Also, the kit lens is much, much better than I expected for my needs.  My cats' coats with subtle but beautiful color markings are accurately captured with this camera and kit lens.  I have cats that I have taken pictures of for years and never got a good shot of until I got this camera.  I got my first great picture of one of my black cats in poor lighting.  I have shown that picture to many friends and posted it on Facebook and no one can believe that the photo was taken in such lousy lighting.  The thing about pets is they do their cutest stuff in the darkest corners of the room.  I have loved that feature the most about this camera.  It is an easy camera to use.  It is well made and idiot proof when it comes to removing the battery, sliding the SD card in and out, changing from photo to video.  Nothing is awkward.  My last point and shoot had a lot of \"quirks\" when putting in batteries and the SD card. No such quirks here.  No hard to close hinges.  Everything works as it should.  For a beginner, this is not something to be taken lightly.  Some of us get frustrated rather easily.  You can concentrate on learning how to take better pictures rather than how to make the camera work.  The menu is idiot proof.  No quirks there.  Very common sense and intuitive.  The camera display is very, very sharp.  Very easy to view pictures.  You can do some editing of the photos before you load them onto your computer which is sometimes very, very helpful.  You will become a better photographer for having this camera.  In the process, you will have a lot of fun and get great photos--all without any frustration.One thing I forgot to add, the battery life is wonderful.  It was 2 months before I had to recharge. I took about 600 photos at my leisure during that time.  That alone is worth the price of the camera.I have to add that I love the colors that this camera picks up. I have ten years of pictures of my gersman shepherd lab who is a reddish gold color.  I just went over all the pictures I have of her.  Those taken with point and shoots, cell phones, even on two \"professional\" photographer's photos and the pictures taken by the Nikon D5100 are washed out and dull.  Only the the Nikon D5100 captures the deep red/gold hue accurately.  I hold a picture next to her, the Nikon pictures are so much like her that I cannot tell any difference whatsoever.

This of course it the price you pay for the highest quality pictures you can get.Because of the weight issue I've been thinking about getting a compact.  I've tried several Olympus (ZX-1, PEN 1, PEN 2) and found them shall we say lacking in clarity (they just can't stand up to D700 quality and seem like a waist of time).  I wanted to like the P7000, but all the reviews say its a POS.  So, I started looking at the weight of some of these new DSLRs and thought that may be the option for me.  The DP Review rated it quite well, so I figured I would give it a shot.Well I have to say that I'm extremely impressed.  I love the weight and the simple controls.  The articulating screen is sweet and extremely useful.  After I put some decent glass on the thing (the kit lens is a POS!), I have got some fabulous pictures with the thing up to ISO 3200.  The color output is really amazing. Very contrasty and requires little post-processing (I only shoot RAW, so I couldn't tell you about the in camera jpegs).  I think this is from the EXPEED-2 processor and bods very well for a D800.  There is a fair amount of noise reduction, that really softens things too much, but it's easy to take out with capture NX 2.  Overall, I would say that the picture quality is 80 percent of the D700 up to ISO 3200.  This is more than I ever expected for a $800 camera (versus $2500 for a D700).Bravo Nikon!

Had to send it back again, got it repaired and then the \"black image\" issue came back. I lost my California trip completely . Highly frustrating. I was Nikon guy for so many years and never had problem with my previous camera , but this quality sucks. Now I realizes \"Reliability\" is the key in photography.

I had to upgrade.I was torn between the D3100 and the D5100 - the D7000 was outside my price range  :( . I chose the D5100 since it uses the same 16 MP sensor as the fantastic D7000. These things addressed are mostly stuff that wasn't on the D60Pros1. Great image resolution - you will not get better image quality from any similar priced camera. The colorization engine inside the processor is excellent - it seems to preserve sharpness, and you can choose the sharpness in camera.2. Exposure Bracketing - this is one thing that the D60 didn't have that I was really missing out on.3. In-camera RAW processing. This is super handy. I don't wanna have to turn on the ol' computer and open my hacked copy of CS5 every time. The ViewNX software is atrocios since it tuns its own sharpening routine automatically which accents any grain. (i could go on and on about the ViewNX but it's free so i can't complain too much)4. D-lighting is somewhat useful for jpeg output.5. White balance settings are modifiable.6. LCD is reticulating. Yes this is kinda gimicky, but it does have its usefulness once in a while.7. Live view mode - and it has face recognition! (see cons 1 below)8. HD video - while i do not use this much, it is nice to have.9. Quiet shutter mode - this means the shutter mirror return happens AFTER you release the shutter button. The camera only make one click when you take a picture. You don't get the typical snap-snap that SLR's are known for.10. AUto-ISO mode allow minumum shutter speed setting (very nice)Cons1. Shooting in live view mode is really cumbersome - there is noticeable lag from shutter press to activation. This is not typically a problem, but if you are tightly composing your shot it'll be an issue since the hand shake may move the image lightly in that half-second timeframe before it actually captures the photo.2. Flash sync speed only down to 1/200 seconds? BOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO. MINUS one star for that3. Auto-ISO seems to ignore the fact that you are using the flash - this means that in a dark room, if you take a picture with the flash, you will get an extremely grainy image since the camera used an ISO rating that you would use WITHOUT the flash. MINUS one star for this.4.

At this stage however, I'm an amateur and enjoy general photography: people, events, kids, nature, travel, etc.... I've owned a D-5100 for a year and a half now. Here's some quick pros and cons. Hopefully people will find my review helpful:Pros:1. Small, handy, light, ergonomic, and very well balanced camera.2. Easy to get started, with plenty of features and flexibility to grow into and be creative.3. Plenty of lenses (and many inexpensive) for every occasion.4. Reliable, durable, and well built.5. Good focus mechanism which actually doesn't let you down in low light as some other amateur series DSLR's do.6. Great noise reduction, which allows for higher ISO shooting at low light.7. Image quality at par with any pro series DSLR up to ISO 800. At higher ISOs you do have slight noise buildup, but you'll have to pay $2000 for a camera that can produce better images.8. Great deal nowadays with the discounts offered.Cons:1. Battery life could be better. This is no big deal however, as you can buy a couple of Wasabi brand batteries for $20 each and you will always have charge.2. Camera doesn't have in-body motor for autofocus, so your autofocus speed and quality will depend to a great extend on the lens you have.3. If you buy this camera it has the smaller 3/4 sensor which uses a different size lens. If you are looking at moving up the ladder to full size sensor camera in the future, your lenses from this camera won't be useful on a full sized sensor camera.For general photography I would suggest you buy the Nikon D5100 body only (don't bother with the Nikon lens packages that come with it, just get the body). Then buy the Sigma 18-250 Macro HSM lens ($500)...That one lens on this camera will have you covered. The Sigma lens is absolutely of superb quality. Also go ahead and invest is some inexpensive polarizer and UV filters ($20), a nice collapsible rubber hood ($20), along with the Nikon SB-400 flash ($100)[Get a flash because not only do you get more power than on camera flashes, but you also manage to eliminate the flash-shadow problem of on-camera flash on power zooms. You also won't be using your in camera batteries to fire up the flash].I think if I do the math right, the package I've just described should add up to about $1000 and weight no more than 2 lbs.

I was going on a short trip and wanted to bring my camera along and do some fun shooting. I started packing my stuff and realized it would really be a chore carrying this stuff (the temperature was 111 degrees and not going to be getting any cooler for a while).  So I decided just to leave it home.  The day I got home I ordered the D5100.  I had been looking at this camera as a solution and had actually recommended it to a friend who is new to DSLR Photography and got to help her set her camera up.  So my interest was really peaked. Anyways, I bought it and I am happy and amazed.I Like:Its light weight and easy to pack and carry.Image quality and sharpness is outstanding.Movie clips easy.The Special effects are really fun.The shutter is really quiet.The pop up flash is not a power monger like on my old D60 so you can actually use it.Also the pop up flash can be put into manual mode (over the default TTL mode) and you can set the power level. In this mode I use the pop up to trip remote/Slave flash units. NB: by the way this option is not covered in the manual.Some not really cons:I'm used to being able quickly change shooting parameters on my D300s with the options on the camera body. On the D5100 you have to go into the menu structure or hit the info button and scroll through and change the parameters on the screen.  I'm getting used to it (So, not really bad).I do like to shoot in manual mode and only having a single command dial which changes the shutter speed and having to hold down the exposure compensation button to change the aperture is a little annoying.  Have to learn to live with it.Oh and:Using the selective color... you cannot pop the pop up flash.  However, if you want (after you have set up your selection and are ready to shoot) you can mount an external flash like the SB400 and the flash will work fine.  I used this process to also trigger a remote flash while using the selective color effect.ThanksThat's all folks :)", "Date": "July 13, 2012"}, {"Title": "Great buy", "Author": "Jenna", "ReviewID": "RQ6LOTYVU2I69", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I wanted to get a DSLR camera to take pictures in a low-light setting.  Torn between the Canon Rebel T3i and the Nikon D5100, I finally made the decision to purchase the Nikon D5100.  Here is why:Toptenreviews.com ranked Canon Rebel T3i number one 9.88 and the Nikon D5100 number two with 9.63.  So, with a .25 difference, the two cameras a certainly excellent options for DSLR, especially for the price range.I consider myself a hobbyist photographer owning a Nikon D80 that I have had for years shooting varies subjects: family reunions, anniversaries, portraits, landscapes, animals, sports events, etc.  With this in mind, I have always been partial to Nikon's usability.  However, I have heard from various friends about how wonderful the Canon Rebel is so I welcomed the opportunity to test it out myself. Indeed, they did not steer me wrong, the Canon Rebel T3i is wonderful, but it is not the option I decided to take for low-light photograph.I am taking pictures in low-light settings, where Nikon's flash consistency excels. Although the T3i shoots 3.7 frames per second and the Nikon shoots 4 frames per second, the difference is not very noticeable. However, the D5100 has distortion control (T3i does not) and a longer battery life.I am also impressed with Nikon's overall generic settings--auto,portrait, etc.  I wanted a camera that would be user friendly in case someone else wanted to try using the camera, etc.", "Date": "June 25, 2012"}, {"Title": "Buy it.", "Author": "AC", "ReviewID": "R1OPDFUOOY13UL", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "...Seriously. If you're reading reviews here, you're most likely thinking about purchasing the D5100. I'm not yet a professional photographer, but I am a serious enthusiast with the intent of eventually taking my photography to the next level. I am the (proud) owner of a Nikon D60, and I can say that the D5100 is a very strong upgrade from the D60. Improvements in image quality were immediately noticed with the D5100, and low light shooting is awesome with this camera. When I bought my D60, I had high hopes for the low light shooting capabilities, however it ended up falling short of my expectations. The D5100 definitely meets the expectations I originally had for the D60 in regards to low light shooting, and possibly even exceeds them a bit. That being said, the D60 is still a great camera which takes great photos, and I would highly recommend it to anyone starting out in SLR photography. The manual for the D60 is definitely a bit better than the D5100's, and explains things in greater detail. The way the buttons feel on the D5100 when pressed seem cheaper than that of the D60, but that's just an observation of mine from owning both cameras, and someone purchasing the D5100 probably wouldn't even notice this unless they had another camera to compare it to. The D5100 still feels solid and of good quality, and you get professional looking image results, even using the kit 18-55mm lens. With the 35mm f1.8 Nikon prime lens, you get even sharper results, and it is definitely a recommended accessory for anyone who purchases this camera. I purchased this camera in February because I wanted to have it for a vacation I was taking. Needless to say it did not disappoint!For those interested in HDR photography, this camera does have an auto bracketing feature which can be used in conjunction with the self timer, allowing for hands free operation (granted you have a tripod.) However, you can only do one image over and one image under exposed using this option, and the timer (or auto bracketing) have to be reset after each series of images due to the assign button only having the capability of one feature being assigned to it at a time. This is something that I didn't happen to notice in anyone's review here, (maybe I just missed it?) but would have liked to have known ahead of time. Certainly not a deal breaker though, and no reason to give it less than 5 stars. I could go on and on, but there's not much here with everyone's reviews that hasn't already been said. Basically, almost all of the positive comments here are most likely true, and buying this camera should be a purchase that you won't regret. Especially when it's on sale! It's essentially a less professional version of the D7000 with the same image quality for half the price. I originally wanted the D7000, but couldn't justify the price. I can say with confidence that I made the right choice by saving my money and going for the D5100.

Given the price, 5 STARS for image quality, features and convenience of use.Second, I got the body (no kit lenses, which seem to have pretty mediocre ratings from users), along with the Nikon 35mm f/1.8G AF-S DX (5+ STARS) and the Nikon 55-300mm f/4.5-5.6G ED VR AF-S DX (4+ STARS for athletic events).  I later added a AF-S DX NIKKOR 10-24mm f/3.5-4.5G ED (5+ STARS) and the 16-85mm f/3.5-5.6 ED VR (4 STARS, but a great snapshot lens).So far so good.  Why only 3 STARS?  Here's what I don't like.Autofocus hunts a lot sometimes, especially in marginal light.  It doesn't seem to matter what lens is on the camera, so I assume it's the body.  It's not a problem most of the time, but occasionally you can lose a shot because the camera is trying to figure out what to look at.The video feature, while not at all my priority, is pretty primitive as far as settings go.  The major problem, however, is autofocus again, which can suddenly in the middle of a video start radically seeking focus, moving way in and out before settling back down.  Occasionally, the camera will lose focus altogether.  Manual focus works best, but is not always practical.  Setting the camera's focus on the center point also works a little better, but the camera keeps wanting to shift to some other point in the frame and you have to keep resetting it (I haven't been able to figure out how to defeat this tendency).My last point of dissatisfaction emerged this weekend and may be the most serious.  After a week's uneventful shooting, I downloaded the images, cleared the card, changes lenses and charged the battery.  When I turned the camera back on, it gave the dreaded \"Error press shutter release button again\" message, which apparently is no rare experience for this or a number of other Nikon cameras.  Of course, pressing the shutter release button again accomplishes nothing.  After losing a weekend's use of the camera, I was all ready to ship it back to Nikon when I stumbled on a forum post, [...] (scroll down until you come to \"Rico\" and be sure to look at his subsequent posts).  CAUTION: there are many reasons for this error, not all of which can be solved by the solution offered in this post, and there are some other DIY solutions out there that seem absolutely nutty to me.  To cut to the chase, my problem was my mirror had jammed in the down position against what is supposed to be a stop.  Some gentle prying (not for the faint of heart) freed the mirror and the camera has been working since.  This design or engineering flaw has really left a bad impression.So 5 STARS for image quality and basic functionality, less one star for autofocus difficulties (especially video) and less one big star for design and reliability.I'm probably being generous.", "Date": "December 8, 2013"}, {"Title": "Just a Mom's point of view on the camera", "Author": "Christine", "ReviewID": "R1C7WUBWFYMSPA", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "After weeks of product and spec research the great nikon vs cannon debate...I felt like I was being spun around and confused which camera to buy!

I sold it and replaced it with a Nikon D5100.  The first thing I noticed is the Nikon works well with nearly any SD card.My Canon had the upgraded 18-135mm kit lens.  The Nikon arrived with the 18-55mm kit lens, which, apart from less telephoto range, is actually a much sharper lens with less chromatic aberration in the corners of the frame than the Canon 18-135.PHOTOS:The Nikon takes sharper photos than the T2i (comparing the two lenses I had), despite having 16 megapixels vs 18 for the Canon.  The Nikon also has a one F-Stop advantage in low light, getting great pictures even at ASA 6400.  The T2i was good in low light.  The Nikon is great.  It just looks cleaner in low light.In the default standard setting mode, the color saturation and the contrast is a little bit less in the Nikon, but the image is more realistic.  The automatic white balance seems to be more accurate in the Nikon, getting truer whites in more types of lighting conditions without having to resort to manually setting white balance all the time.  Of course, both cameras have tons of control over the color and contrast.  The Nikon has infinitely more manual control over white balance, allowing you to dial in the perfect setting by hand with an X-Y color grid. The Canon has the usual half dozen presets.VIDEO:As with still photos, all the color and contrast characteristics are similar from the photo mode to the video mode.  It's here where the Canon wins out with it's more filmic saturation and contrast.  The Nikon wins out in sharpness, which may not make it look as pretty for films, but it is a more natural looking image for general video use.Both cameras max out at 1920x1080 resolution at 30 frames per second, and both have 24 frame film modes.  What's missing on the D5100 is the 720-60 frame mode found on the T2i.  In the 720-60 frame mode, video motion is silky smooth.  In 30 frame mode, it has a filmic looking stutter in the motion.  Some users prefer this effect.  But the Nikon, even though having only 30 or 24 frame modes, allows you to select high video quality or normal video quality.  Using the normal mode doubles your capture time on the SD card at the expense of barely more digital artifacting.The Canon allows you to control the ASA, the iris and the shutter speed manually in the video mode.  When set to fully automatic, the iris is very smooth when transitioning from light to dark subjects.The Nikon does not allow you full manual control over the iris in video mode, and the iris sort of steps through many ranges from light to dark.  It isn't a smooth transition in manual or automatic mode.  Since you can't lock down the exposure in video mode, the camera is not suited for advanced film makers who need total image control.  Too bad, because the Nikon doesn't cease up during the video shoot if you put class 6 or even class 4 SD cards in it.  The Canon will simply stop recording on it's own if it doesn't like the brand or speed of card you use.SOUND:Both cameras have an external mike jack and no headphone jack.  The Nikon has a few presets to eliminate or lower the AGC function and control the audio level.  The Canon has no control over audio levels and you can not defeat the AGC unless you buy special software that can re-program the camera's firmware (some users have frozen up their cameras doing this the wrong way).CONTROLS:I found the Canon easier to program than the Nikon, especially in video mode.  The Nikon takes some experimenting (or reading the dreaded instructions) to discover the extra layers of image control it possesses.  Once you delve in and learn the menu, there's far more intricate image control with the Nikon.With the Canon, you set it to video mode, turn it on and press the red button to begin recording video.  The Nikon requires the extra step of setting the live view mode each time you power it up, while the Canon can be left in the video mode all the time.The image stabilizer in the Canon is better for walk-around hand held shooting than the Nikon, providing much smoother shots in the steady hands of a seasoned user.SUMMARY:I liked the Canon better for it's filmic look and ease of use, but I value the Nikon for it's better low light performance, sharper image and most of all, it's total reliability and not being dependent upon the choice of SD card.", "Date": "October 6, 2011"}, {"Title": "Extensive Review By Photography Newbie", "Author": "Alan Montgomery", "ReviewID": "RW8RI89N3OZTX", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This review is aimed at people who are new to photography, as I am in the same boat.  There are much more thorough reviews on Amazon for people who are already serious photographers.General Impression:Wonderful camera - gives you control of parameters (such as f/stop, ISO, shutter speed) when you want to play with them or get creative and will auto-select them when you just want to take pictures.  This was important to me as I am still learning to adjust them to my liking but don't want to miss out on pictures because I'm fumbling around with buttons.Construction/Feel:After going to Best Buy to physically hold the Canon T3i and Nikon d5100, I immediately decided on the Nikon.  It felt much better in my hands and just looked better in general.  Both were fairly light which is nice but also means they are made from quite a bit of plastic - not a problem though as this keeps the price down and I don't drop things.Controls:I have been pleased with the placement of the physical buttons on the camera as well as the menus.  I mainly shoot in the A, S, and M modes and the little wheel you turn to adjust the shutter speed/aperture is right where your thumb falls.  If you're in M mode, there is an aperture button to hold down just behind the shutter button which is also easy to reach with the camera up to your eye.  Lastly, the Fn button can be programmed to control the ISO level so you can hold it down while spinning the wheel to change that without putting the camera down.  I have heard people complain that the Live View switch is annoying to get to but have found it intuitive.There are a few controls that I wish were changeable without having to dig through a menu though.  For instance, to change the focus mode from area to single point requires you to have the LCD screen turned around, then press the I button, then scroll around to change it.  This is the case for a few other things like metering, shutter mode, etc.  I can't really complain, though, because those are features that go on a serious photographer's camera that costs about twice as much as this model.Auto Focus:The 11-point AF on this camera has been a dream to use.  I almost always keep the camera set to single point servo autofocus so I can select the point I want it to focus to.  As long as you have some contrast, it is very quick and accurate to focus.  This camera does not have a build in focus motor which means the lens must have it built in.  As a result, older lenses or those build for the professional Nikons may not allow for autofocus.  This hasn't been a big issues as most of the lenses I would want already have the motor built in, and if they don't, people survived for a long time manually focusing - it probably builds character.  I was torn between getting the Nikon 10-24mm  Wide-Angle Zoom Lensand Tokina 11-16mm Ultra-wide Angle Lensand ended up sticking with the Tokina even though it would not autofocus on this camera.  I haven't had any issues with focusing manually with it as the ultra-wide angles are easy to focus anyway.Noise:A lot of the reviews I read before purchasing this camera talked about how well it shot in low light - I would have to agree.  Looking at pictures from my old point and shoot at ISO 800 have horrible noise while I can shoot this at 1600 without any, and can go up to 3200 with only minimal touch ups in Lightroom needed.  This has to be the single biggest advantage of digital over film - being able to change ISO on the fly and still being able to get great pictures at ISO 3200 is wonderful.Image Quality:I won't offer too many opinions in this section, but I have not seen anything but great quality in the RAW pictures I've taken.  Basically I understand that if a picture doesn't come out right, the fault lies with me and not the camera.  The camera is capable of much better pictures than I am capable of taking.  When I do everything right (which is becoming a little more frequent) I am amazed of the result.  Great colors, great contrast, low noise, etc.Battery Life:I purchased an extra battery before I went on a few business trips just in case, but ended up never being close to needing it.  The battery just lasts and lasts and never seems to drain.  For instance, last weekend I took 381 shots (some using live view) and the battery meter was still at 75%.  No complaints in this department.Flash:The built in flash is pretty puny, which seems to be par for the course.  It does provide some nice fill lighting if you're outside taking pictures where there are some shadows on your subject, but for shooting inside it's marginal at best.  I bought the very reasonably priced Nikon SB-400 AF Speedlight Flash and have been very pleased with the combo.  The external flash adds the ability to bounce light off the ceiling and not waste the camera battery while doing so. This camera does not have the Nikon flash commander ability, but I don't think that should be expected in a camera at this price point.  If I ever start buying 3 remote flashes for studio shooting, there is a good chance I will have already upgraded cameras.I'll end by saying that this has been an absolutely wonderful camera to learn to shoot on.  Before I purchased it or started shooting, I ordered and read two books,Complete Digital PhotographyThe Digital Photography Book so I would have some clue what I wanted in a camera.  They are both wonderful books and should be required reading for all new photographers.As a disclaimer: up till 3 months ago I was never in to photography, never owned an SLR and never had any real interest to.

The size of the Sony was much more appealing, and I still question my decision because of that factor. I went with the Nikon because my husband has an older (very heavy) Nikon DSLR and he has several lenses that would be compatible with this camera. So far, I've only used the kit lens and I've been very happy with it. I also think that the viewfinder on this camera allows me to take better pictures than I could take with the Sony, which does not have a viewfinder.

Like a car - she wants to be able to  drive it, she is not really interested in how powerful the engine is, or what kind of electronics are in it.She loves this camera.  She is able to take pictures in a variety of settings and light conditions, and has great success in getting good pictures. Her primary target is my tennis playing son, so she needs to be able to capture motion, and have him be in focus. The sports setting on the camera does a great job with that. She has this paired with the 18-200 Nikon lens, and finds that to be perfect. For those wondering about the need for an external flash (I have one), she has not run into many situations that the internal flash has not been adequate for most things, although there is a problem with red-eye (which should be expected).Set up is quick, simple, and intuitive. She has no problems with transferring pictures, and getting what she needs in the settings. As she has progressed, and wants to be able to take pictures in more \"difficult\" settings (for instance at a person with a bright light source in the background), she has been able to read, and learn how to do this, so the camera has grown with her.I would consider myself a advanced amateur, and also find this camera to be a joy to use, although I do miss some settings that I have on my D90.I would recommend this camera to anyone from beginner (that wants a camera they can grow with, not just a point and shoot - it does a great job, but probably a waste of money - there are many cheaper options that would do fine for that) to an advanced amateur. The camera is easy to use, and able to take high quality pictures in a variety of settings. The program modes are exceptional in their ability to do as they are supposed to most of the time.

F", "ReviewID": "R2JW1V79VPSQHI", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "I had this camera for about a year and got to know it very well. I had upgraded from a D60.The camera's main selling point - compared to the d3100 - was its 16 megapixel sensor which the d7000 also has. Unfortunately, the lack of all the other cool bells and whistles that the d7000 has (see below) leaves the d5100 in an identity crisis. Other minor gimmicky things are bracketing, in camera HDR, better lcd with swivel.To be perfectly honest, all these things I have found to be not incredibly useful for real world applications.Bracketing:Okay, you're in a studio, crunched for time, the editor of a magazine is on your back for the pictures for their next month's cover. You don't have time to get exact lighting levels, so you just set to bracket and viola. Sure, that's a great use for it. unfortunately, no buyer of a d5100 will be doing this. If you are doing this you will have a much more expensive camera. For the average person, the bracketing only fills up your memory card 3x faster. It is absolutely useless for anything other than posed shots, which is probably a very small segment of who would actually be buying this camera.HDR:I used this about twice in the year I owned it, and to be honest I forgot which pictures i did with it. You can't do it on a moving subject. Same situation as bracketing; only posed shots or architecture. Very seldom a use case for someone buying a sub-1000 dollar camera.Swivel LCD:Ultra gimicky. How often does anyone really need this? The ONLY time i used this was self-portrait. that's it.My other miscellaneous gripes:1. The LCD seems to get dust inside it very easily. After a year (just sold it here) there were noticeable spots of dust under the LCD on the lower right side.2. Inferior autofocus sensor seems to have trouble getting anything but kit lenses in focus consistently. This is the main reason I sold it. AF just wasn't reliable. I heard the same with the D7000. You would think after 50 years of making cameras, Nikon would be able to know how to autofocus...3. My LCD had a dead pixel. How did this get past quality control?4. No noticeable difference between Fine and Normal quality jpegs. Fine are like twice the size though.NOTE: There is NO internal AF motor, so you are barred from using any of the non G lenses. This may not be an issue for most people, but I had a couple older D style lenses, and i couldn't use them. Also, no commander mode for external flashes. I realize these two things would make it more expensive, so that's why they didn't add them.Conclusion:If you are thinking of getting this camera, my advice is to seriously consider the d3100 (now d3200) instead, as that does 90% of what this one does and is a couple hundred $$ cheaper. If you are looking to take pictures of family/friends and want to step into the world of DSLR as a beginner, go with the d3100. Honestly, the extra few megapixels is not significant.If you are getting more serious about photography and want to start using primes or external flashes, you will need to get the d7000/d7100.If you know something about photography, you will outgrow this camera very quickly and my advice is just cut to the chase and buy the higher model. you won't be disappointed.", "Date": "April 10, 2013"}, {"Title": "Great camera for the beginner SLR with a little more money", "Author": "Rauf Schneider", "ReviewID": "R1KIFD5NKB3MXX", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Let me state that I am an average Joe, and had no delusions that this would make me a pro photographer or make good pictures.Brief background:  my friend wanted to convince me on getting Nikons, and gave me his D7000 to try out.  After enjoying playing around with it, I initially was ready to fork the big bucks for it.  But when I went to the store, I saw the D5100, and started handling with it, and was pretty impressed by it.  Reading the specs, most are similar to the D7000 in terms of sensors, and it had a flip screen.  After a little soul searching (i.e. \"Am I really going to do semi-pro work?\", \"How much will I lug around?\"), I decided to save some money and go with the D5100.  After having it for 3 months, I am pretty satisfied.Weight/handling:  very light when compared to the D7000; I can hold it in one hand if need be (but will usually use 2) without straining the wrists.  This was one of the big sells.18-55mm lens:  perfect for most pics I will take with it.  I don't plan on zooming in too much, and gives me time to compose my photographs well.Modes:  I mostly stick with Auto and P modes, and they get my pics well.Flash:  This is the weak spot of this camera or any SLR.  It will give good direct lighting, but like most flashes, it will be rather harsh.  I would highly recommend the Nikon SB-400 Nikon SB-400 AF Speedlight Flash for Nikon Digital SLR Cameras as a companion flash; it is lightweight and gives good bounce capability in landscape mode to diffuse the harshness of the flash--you can even make a DIY light box out of paper for portrait views (see Ken Rockwell's site for review of this flash to see how it is done).Screen:  Flip screen is best for most of us average Joes; you will not get that in the D7000.  Also, if you get confused about using aperture, it will show you the f setting with a picture of the iris.  Image viewing is also pretty efficient in it.Movies:  I would stick with either a dedicated camcorder, phone, or point and shoot for these.  Too much focusing on auto focus mode, and you will not have the time to continuously focus with it.  I had no plans to use it as a video camera anyways.Images:  I have been pretty impressed by the images taken by this camera.  Again, I am looking for overall quality, and it has not disappointed me.  One note:  if shooting with the low burst on, be sure to watch how much you press the button; you may automatically shoot 2-3 burst when you wanted to shoot one.  Also, the low burst is pretty decent at capturing most action shots you will need for children or mobile activities.Conclusion:  The D5100 has more than enough features to satisfy 95% of the public.  While the D7000 is a solid camera, I would reserve it for the serious amateur.  You will also save about $500-700 with this kit over the D7000 kit, which you can always use for fixed or telephoto lenses.

When digital finally got to the point that SLR's were affordable (if you can consider ~$2000 and up affordable) I stuck with Nikon due to the glass I already owned. I started with the D100 and a used D1h. I then got a new D2h (which I still love in all its 4MP glory)and a D200, and now own a D300. I have also owned a Canon D30, a Canon 20D and a Canon t2i, so I have a pretty fair amount of experience with DSLR's. While I like my D300 and would marry my D2h, I have never been truly happy with the hi-iso performance of either. I shoot a lot of grappling tournaments in really bad light, meaning lots of noisy photos. A friend of mine owns a D7000 and I was a little jealous of the hi-ISO files. It just didn't feel like it was worth the money to upgrade though.Then D5100 refurbs dropped below $400. I already knew I loved the files from the D7000, and they share the same sensor, so why not give one a shot?I am MORE than happy with my decision - I LOVE this camera!Reason #1 - the beautiful files at all iso's. I'm not going to get all techie. I could care less about measurements, etc. The files from this camera are, to me, exquisite. With my D2h going above iso 800 is suicide. With my D300 I will use 1600 in most light and can use 3200 in a pinch with cleanup in Lightroom. With the D5100 I would have NO problem leaving this thing set at 3200 all the time. I'm happy with 6400 most of the time in color, and 6400 files in B&W; take me back to my film days. The majority of the time I don't do any noise clean-up in Lightroom.Reason #2 - the size & weight. This thing is small and light. My D2h is a tank. Literally. And it feels like carrying one. The D300 gets a little hefty too. The D5100 does not really feel much heavier than my Olympus EPL-1. As a matter of fact, my EPL-1 has not left the house since I got the D5100. My last 2 hikes I have slapped my 35mm 1.8 on the D5100 and been happy as a pig in poop. My other cameras look much more professional and tend to make some people nervous. The D5100 looks like, well, what it is, a cheap intro camera. I don't get \"the look\" from security guards, etc.Reason #3 - the video. Not as many manual controls as my old t2i, but the video is still stunning when done right.What Else Do I Like - I like that it uses SD cards, just like all of my compact cameras. I like the articulating screen. I like that my 8 year old daughter can handle it without moaning about the size.What do I miss - sometimes I miss the top lcd for a quick check of settings. Sometimes I miss the dual command dials, but since I shoot mostly in aperture priority, it's rare. I have the Fn button programmed to select ISO, which works fairly well, but I do sometimes miss a dedicated button. I almost never mess with WB, so I don't particularly miss that button, but I do miss having a way to select the frame-rate/timer. Having to go into the menus can sometimes slow things down a little. I felt a little nervous today shooting in a snowstorm since the camera is not weather sealed.So, while there may be a few things I miss, mostly having to do with controls, and I do have a little concern over the lack of weather seals, for the price, I am NOT going to complain. I have had the camera for 3 weeks now and have not touched my D2h or my D300. I am enjoying it that much.

I have used Nikon and Canon SLRs.  My job is to sell cameras of all sorts and for a long time I have been waiting to purchase this camera.  For all of the features that these cameras offer and everything they do, this camera is worth every penny.  The burst and sports modes are very fast and clear.  The auto focus is quick and the change from shot to shot is minimal for a delay.  As far as the camera is easy to use I'd give it an 8 if you've never used a SLR before.  If you leave it in full auto or no-flash modes, the camera will do all of the work for you.  Of course the brilliant quality of the SLR is there.  If you want to use the manual modes changing the shutter speed and aperture is simple.  The dial next to the right thumb will automatically change the shutter speed and to change the aperture simply hold down the +/- button next to the shutter while spinning the dial.  The daunting task is to change the iso.  My assumption for the design is that they assume if you are in manual mode that the scenario of shooting will not require frequent iso change.  It's not difficult to change, but if you do not read the manual or purchase the user dvd it will take some searching for.If you compare this model to the D3100 and D3200, the one thing that this adds that the others don't is a variety of scene modes and effects.  These scene modes are what you expect from a camera nowadays.  However the effects are a really nice addition.  This offers color selection so that you can highlight one color and make the rest of the picture black and white.  Other features include night vision, color sketch, high key, low key, silhouette.  My favorites being night vision, low key and silhouette.  Night vision makes every picture look like something from a military game.  If you've ever seen a video through a set of NVG's you know what I'm talking about.  Low key provides intentional underexposure, a particular effect that I love.  I use this regularly for my photography to give it a more striking impression.  Lastly, the silhouette feature is perfect for taking pictures of people.  This effect gives the picture a beautiful dramatic look.My last subject will be the viewfinder and the screen.  The screen is wonderful, I love being able to turn it around so that the screen is not used at all.  This saves so much battery.  To use this effect, all I say is ensure that you know the picture will come out right.  Without the screen there is no preview option for your photos.  Otherwise the screen works beautifully with live view if you are going for a low or a high shot so you do not have to worry about the picture coming out wrong.  You can always ensure you get the shot you are looking for.  My only complaint about the camera is the diopter in the viewfinder.  For a person with glasses, this may not adjust correctly to your vision.  With the D3100 and D3200 as well as sever Canon Rebels I did not have such a problem.  However, with the D5100 I cannot properly adjust the viewfinder to my eyes.  So sadly if I want to do a shot that involves manual focusing, I will wear my glasses and adjust the picture that way.  Otherwise I still put my eyes to the viewfinder.All in all, I would recommend this camera to anyone, of any level.  If you are a novice photographer or a skilled photographer this camera is a wonderful tool to have.  Always remember that your camera is only limited by two things.

I am partial to Nikons generally.  The D5100 fits the description perfectly as a better-than-entry-level camera that won't completely break the bank.  It's a great starter DSLR for someone that you think might have aptitude and interest in this area.  There is an automatic setting to start off with, but there are plenty of manual settings that you can play with as you explore the camera's capabilities.  The resolution is excellent, and the colors come out crisp and clean.I'm not able to review the video capability of the camera as I'm not a video person, and prefer something like the (now discontinued) Flip cameras for video, anyway, as they are lighter, smaller, and more convenient than a DSLR.For a true starter DSLR, the Nikon D3100 is generally what is recommended in the Nikon line, but for the extra money, I think the D5100 is a better value, as the camera performance is better than the D3100, and the additional functionality means that you won't have to replace it as quickly.  Someone just starting out in digital photography can grow into the D5100 and use it for many years before needing to upgrade.Nikon cameras in general are very reliable and high performing.

I read numerous reveiws on consumer reports, dpreview.com (which is an incredible site for camera education), and on bestbuy, and B&H; photo.  I finally narrowed my choice down to the Canon T3i and the Nikon D5100.  They both have great features - many of which I'll probably never use, but I would love to try.  Finally, I went to Best Buy, just to hold the camera, and see how it felt shooting with it.  Without question, the Nikon was extremely superior.  I think in terms of options and features, they're both pretty equal.  In terms of ergonomics and how the camera feels in your hand, the Canon didn't cut it.  I'm a guy with average size hands, and it felt like the Canon was made for someone with much smaller hands.  The right hand grip was narrow, the gripping material felt cheaper, and overall it was just awkward feeling.  If I were to use this camera for more than 5 minutes, I'm sure I would get a hand cramp.  The shooting speed was very slow too.  I think the camera at Best Buy had the 18-55mm lens on it, and it took a long time to focus in between shots.  It was very slow.  We were getting this camera to take pictures of our 2 year old, who does not sit still, so our main requirement was to have a quick camera.  I went home and immediately purchase the Nikon on Amazon.  The Nikon D5100 felt great.  It fit in my hand perfectly, and was very comfortable. My wife loves it too, and has no problems handling the camera. The focusing is extremely fast, which enables us to take quick pictures with great results.  We did something different with our purchase, which we were very happy with.  Rather than the stock lenses (18-55 and 70-300mm lenses) we purchased the camera/body-only, a Nikkor AF-S 50mm/f1.8G prime lens Nikon 50mm f/1.8G AF-S NIKKOR FX Lens for Nikon Digital SLR Cameras, and the Sigma 18-250mm f/3.5-6.3 DC OS HSM IF Sigma 18-250mm f/3.5-6.3 DC OS HSM IF Lens for Nikon Digital SLR Cameras lenses.  The Sigma lens gives us everything we need - the ability to zoom in and get close ups from far away, or the ability to get a wide shot.  The 50mm prime lens is awesome.  It is perfect for shots in dark rooms or at weddings, and we've used it to take portrait/family type shots too.  The D5100 is fantastic.  We could not be happier.  The pictures are so clear, the focusing is so quick, and the menus on the camera are very easy to navigate through.  Overall, I give this camera a 10/10.  Sidenote - we also purchased the AmazonBasics Backpack AmazonBasics Backpack for SLR Cameras and Accessories-Blackto store the camera/equipment in.  The bag fits everything, is comfortable to carry, and will not tip over when you set it down.

A few years ago I found myself using those cameras less and less as digital cameras became affordable.  For several years though I didn't have an SLR, instead I used mainly small point and shoot cameras.  Though handy, they just don't give you much control over more than zoom and flash, and the image quality was, um, often marginal.A couple of months ago my wife (bless her heart) gave me a Nikon D5100 with 18-55mm adnd 55-300mm lenses.  I followed the quick start guide and I was up and shooting photos in a matter of only  few minutes.  Yeah!This is the first DSLR I have ever owned, and I'm here to tell you that in my experience this camera is a joy to use, and it gives fantastic results.  I have been using this camera now, heavily, for the past two months, and I've taken at least 2000 photos so far.  I have had chances to use it during all times of the day from dawn-dusk, and into the night.  It performs amazingly in all light levels.This camera gives me LOTS of useful pre-set options as well as the capability to manually control shutter speed, aperture settings, ISO (=ASA or film speed), or to go fully automatic.The camera body feels solid and comfortable in my hand.  The rubberized grip and thumb pad are great.  The 3\" digital screen is also a nice feature.  It can be flipped out, flipped over, adjusted to any angle to accommodate holding the camera high or low, wherever.I was a little confused about one of the automatic settings.  The green one on the dial on the top of the camera.  If you have the camera set there, whenever the camera thinks there is not enough light the flash will automatically pop up.  I find this annoying during daylight shooting, but luckily there is a second fully automatic setting where the flash is disabled.  This is my automatic setting of choice.I love some of the optional settings - like sports mode where you have single point focusing and the camera will shoot up to 4 frames per second if you hold the shutter button down.  There are just too many features to describe here, but there are great options for night portraits, night shots, low light, high light, etc., etc.Oh, this camera also gives you the option to do some image editing right in the camera.  That's nice.  The camera can also be attached to a computer for easy downloading of images, and there's a cable for attaching the camera to a TV so you can show photos to a larger group, as desired.Down sides?  I already mentioned the auto setting flash popping up thing. One other down side is that when you use the camera in video mode the built in microphone is only adequate.  You can adjust the microphone sensitivity from high to low, but that's it.  If you plan to use this camera for video purposes extensively I recommend getting an external stereo microphone that is designed to be seated on the hotshoe flash point on top of the camera.I find that the battery is reasonably good.  One of the first things I did after I decided that this was the camera for me was to pick up a reserve battery.  So now I always have a battery in the camera and a second charged battery in my bag.  I also bought a 32GB SD card, and I have a 4GB SD card in reserve.  I've never filled either of these cards up though, since I download my photos to a computer after each shoot.  But it's nice to know that you have the card space if you need it.Another thing you might want to invest in is a remote control unit for taking group photos that you want to be in.So after two months and 1000s of photos I have tons of praise for this camera and lens - oh, the anti-vibration technology in the lens is also great!With only minor shortcomings here and there, this camera IMO deserves a solid 5-star rating.5 stars!", "Date": "August 18, 2012"}, {"Title": "A thought on Nikon D5100", "Author": "Jay\u2122", "ReviewID": "R1V55TNS1SL0S9", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "What I liked:1.

The viewfinder displays all the info you need and is easy to understand.The \"effects\" mode is fun to use and creates interesting pictures.The video mode is just ok. The auto focus does great if your subject stays at a constant depth/focal length. But once your subject moves closer or father away the auto focus struggles to find and refocus quickly or at all. To be fair, even the d7000 (which is rated best by numerous pundits) struggles with this as well. If you are buying the d5100 to shoot video of kids or fast moving objects, you will be disappointed.\"Live view\" (seeing the scene on the LCD display) makes for easy viewing and the controls to activate it are a finger swipe away.

It had the highest frames per second of comparable cameras when I purchased it last year. It also has HD recording capabilities. This Nikon arrived today and with only touching the basics of how to operate, my photos turned out amazing! My main reason for purchasing a DSLR was to take action shots of my daughters during their sports. I've never been so impressed or pleased with a purchase. Every shot was clear, crisp and mid-air shots were perfect. I could easily blow these up to poster sized with fantastic results.I researched for days and narrowed my choice down to the Nikon D3100, D5100 and the Sony A55. The Sony had the highest frames per second (10), but it wasn't reviewed as highly as the Nikons for overall camera and photo quality. The D5100 has a good size, easy to use controls, the neatest feature is the photo selection piece where you can snap a photo and the camera picks out the dominant color and makes everything else black and white.I was new to the DSLR and interchangeable lenses and overwhelmed.

I'm able to get pretty close up, but I will definitely upgrade to the 50-200mm or 50-300mm lens for my kids' running and swimming events.

Four years ago, I finally gave in to the inevitable and bought my first camera the Nikon D40. I used it mostly for snapshots at first, but the quality was so good and the convenience so tough to beat that I found myself not shooting film much anymore. So I finally decided to take digital seriously and bought the D5100. I considered the D7000 as well, but finally decided I didn't want the bigger and heavier body, and would save the extra $400 to put into lenses.This $650 camera has a sensor that is reputed to be Nikon's best at the moment, except possibly the one in the top-of-the-line D3 that sells for 7-8 times more money.  I am shooting RAW +jpeg, and tweaking the RAW files in Adobe Lightroom 3. (I'm still learning my way around in the world of digital postprocessing. Luckily, Lightroom's controls are very intuitive for somebody who has done darkroom work.) Jpeg shooters should look into fine tuning the camera's Picture controls; you can find many interesting presets on the internet to tune the look. The 6-7 default modes are fine too, but you can add about 9-10 other \"looks.\" Nikon's website has a nice tutorial on developing a custom \"look\" for your photos.  You should also set the camera to correct lens distortions of various types.The image quality in the D5100 is quite incredible up to 800ASA, and rivals the best color films I have shot over the years. (This was not true for my old D40.) The quality drops a bit at 1600ASA, and drops more noticeably at higher speeds. One can still get usable snapshots at 3200 ASA.For the price this camera is an amazing deal. I also bought the 18-105 nikkor, and the 55-200nikkor (at $100 off with the Nikon promotion, it was too good to pass up). I have tested these lenses against my old manual focus nikkor (eg the 50/1.8 AIS) and find their image quality to be similar. The new lenses have a much higher minimum aperture than the old MF lenses, but on other hand have VR image stabilization, which allows a couple more stops of handholding ability. Thus I find little need to bring out the old manual focus lenses (except to get the occasional portrait with blurred background).Bottom line: I am really really excited about the image quality this camera gives with fairly inexpensive kit lenses, something we could only dream of 10 years ago.", "Date": "October 15, 2011"}, {"Title": "A comparison of the D5100 against the older D50", "Author": "Richard C. Clark \"richardcclark\"", "ReviewID": "R2S7DLLDGWK1B7", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "This review is geared for those considering replacing an older Nikon DSLR with the newer D5100.  If that's not you, there are other reviews here that are more comprehensive.I'll start by saying video features mean nothing to me personally so I'm speaking to the photography side of the D5100.  My reference point for these comments is my trusty Nikon D50 which I still love but decided to replace mostly to see if Nikon has moved their technology forward in the seven years I've owned the D50.Pros: the D5100 is a bit smaller, lighter, quieter and faster.  The BIG high resolution screen is a huge help.  HDR mode is great for occasional use and was one of the reasons I chose the D5100 over the more expensive D7000.  Its huge memory buffer and 4 frames per second are a real treat, at parties w/o flash you can \"appear\" to take just one picture of your subject, but in reality you took 15 and they don't know it - pick from the best and you usually have the shot.  The rotating display with live viewing is a huge plus for holding the camera over your head in a crowd and getting the shot.  The ability to \"code\" all your images with a digital fingerprint invisible to the viewers' eyes (such as your email address) is a big plus.  The D5100's enormous memory pretty much only matters to video users or those shooting at full res - I keep mine stepped down to small file sizes but still it's nice to know I could go a whole year without maxing out the camera's memory.  The ability to handle contrast is notably better with the D5100.  I use Google's wonderful Picasa for all my photos, and previously loved its \"I'm feeling lucky\" feature for all my work with the D50.  Now with the newer D5100, the images are so darned good that even Picasa can't make them prettier.  That's impressive.  No complaints about the menus, they all make sense.Cons: even with a fairly hot 35mm f1.8 lens the camera's autofocus is slow or inoperative under tough lighting situations - just like about every other autofocus camera I've used so this is not breaking news.  There's no way to charge the battery with a USB cable, and to my great surprise this camera's battery life is LOWER than my older D50.  The charger is tiny and light but good luck if you forget it on your trip.  Nikon says 600 shots per charge and that might be about right - but it's disconcerting to see that after 150 shots the battery meter is no longer pegged to the right.  In all the years I owned the D50 I never once had it go dead, but in a mere month with the D5100 it already happened.  I'll learn to watch that more closely and it'll be fine, but never the less it was a surprise.If you're still curious about this great camera do yourself a favor and look at what Ken Rockwell has to say about it: (...)", "Date": "September 15, 2011"}, {"Title": "Back to Nikon", "Author": "Keith Melton", "ReviewID": "R21OW76JKRRNK9", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "My first \"good\" camera was a Nikon N60 with various lenses.

I love my Nikon DSLRs, but the D5000 was the only camera I found seriously flawed, both in design and quality.  The D5100 has completely remedied all those problems for me and the D5100 now ranks as my favorite yet!D5000 Problems?1.) The Swivel-out display was unusable because it was hinged at the bottom of the camera instead of the side, which means it's ideal only for over the head shots and could not be used with a tripod mount.  The D5100 gives us a much more usable side-mounted swivel display which can be used with a tripod and can be articulated in many more useful angles (front view, side view, down view, up view, etc.).2.) Because of its position, the Live-View button could easily be triggered when placing the camera to your face.  This has been solved with a MUCH better switch mechanism near the mode-dial, along with a dedicated record button.3.) Live-View auto focusing was extremely slow and often inaccurate, the D5100 has made huge improvements in this area.4.) The D5000 also lacked auto focusing during movie recording, although the D5100 still requires the user to hold down the shutter button to activate AF.5.)  The microphone has been improved dramatically with far more user controls6.) Hot pixels are gone!  The D5000 had notorious hot pixel issues which I've never seen on my previous DSLRs, I had to send my camera back three times...and the problem persisted and got worse every month, Nikon cameras don't have software to automatically map these pixels out so it has to go back to the manufacturer (this almost forced me over to Canon).  Fortunately, the D5100 is flawless!7.)  The D5100 camera body has a flat bottom which is flush with most Nikkor lenses, the D5000 was taller because of the position of the hinged screen, which meant the camera couldn't be used on flat surfaces to take photos (as I like to do when I'm not carrying my tripod).8.)  Probably one of the most critical improvements has been in the resolution of the display, jumping from 230K to 920k.9.)  The diopter now has an easier to use knob instead of a fidgety slider control.10.) Video recording now available in 1080p at 30fps, and without the horrendous rolling \"Jelly\" effectAnd overall, the camera offers much better low-light performance with a much faster and quieter shutter release.  It's also much smaller, lighter and feels much more comfortable to hold because of it's nicer hand grip materials.Needs Improvement.  Like all DSLRs, this is still a terrible handheld video camera.  It takes great video, but the autofocus is still slow and noisy and the microphone is relatively poor.  You are still better off putting this camera on a tripod and controlling the focus yourself for professional results, and using an external mic or recording your own audio.  Thankfully the high res display makes accurate manual focusing much easier.Overall, I feel this is one of Nikon's most polished cameras.", "Date": "July 20, 2011"}, {"Title": "great Great GREAT!", "Author": "A.

Don't underestimate the usefulness of the articulating screen. Its really great for taking self-portraits, or pictures of you and your friends when you don't have a tripod. I have used that feature alone a lot more than I thought I would, and this makes it well more suited than the d7000 for me. The d5100 is also alot lighter than the d7000, and I appreciate some of the gimmicky features that it has (the special scene modes, like sketch and miniature). No overexposure/metering issues in bright sunny days and the same low-light performance of the d5100 makes it a winner for me.Another point is that the battery life of the d5100 is really good.

Once you approve this charge, they'll write back to tell you they re-inspected the problem and it will cost almost as much as the camera to fix.It is a nice camera, but can you afford to be the one stuck with the 1 out 100 cameras that have the sensor problem?", "Date": "February 1, 2012"}, {"Title": "My first dslr camera", "Author": "sonu", "ReviewID": "R25BJ87HQFQ6BW", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I am upgrading from Canon PowerShot SD780 IS to my my first DSLR camera.I was always a cannon guy.

I'm a fairly fluent photographer (I had my own darkroom for a while), but I wouldn't say I'm an expert. Like most people, I take 80% of my pics in Auto mode, but I like to sometimes work in manual mode and compose some good shots.Here's my initial impression:Things I like:- Having HD video with sound feels like a miracle. The image quality is excellent, the sound not so much. I bought an external mic, but it really didn't help much. Advice here welcome!- The kit lens and new sensor technology create very crisp, clean and bright images with a lot of depth. I'd say the images are notably cleaner (less noise) and brighter (better contrast control and metering) than my old D50. But the difference isn't massive, and remember the D50 had only a 6MP sensor- Color and overall balance is excellent- The controls and swivel screen are much, much better than I'm used to. They really help make you a better photographerThings I'm getting used to:- The auto focus settings are confusing and often seem to track to the wrong object in a frame. It's hard to compose a shot and establish strong depth of field without going into manual mode (but this could be user error)- The pre-programmed settings for different shooting conditions haven't made a big impression so far. Easier to create your own shot- The in-camera HDR setting has a subtle but good effect, especially useful in bringing out skies in landscapes- The form factor of the camera is great.So far, so good. One other comment - I'm expecting this will be the last DSLR I will ever buy, and not because this is the camera that will meet all my future needs. The D5100 is pretty bulky - too bulky really - and the next-generation of mirrorless cameras with interchangeable lenses and much smaller form-factors will be the way to go.", "Date": "December 8, 2013"}, {"Title": "Suits the Budget, Serves the Need!!", "Author": "Srithish Somalinga", "ReviewID": "R1S75GJ0T1EA4I", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Let me start of by saying that I love cameras and photography, I consider it as a way of expressing myself when you can't describe a situation with words, an image can speak a thousand!!(A short rambling about the cameras I owned - Skip to the next paragraph for the review)So, I got a hotshot flashless camera (Rs.200 in 1993) as a kid which took a film roll and would allow me to click 24 shots (broad sunlight required for anything to appear on the photo - even indoor pictures appear very dark). Then I decided I had to get a camera with flash. So, I saved my pocket money and got a camera worth Rs.500 in 1998 (this camera let me click 36 photos - standard film roll) which I enjoyed for a while and then came the zoom cameras and I instantly wanted one. So, I took my savings of Rs.6500 and got the Yashica zoom camera in 2002, believe me it had an infrared remote! On getting busy with college, I ended up on a break with photography. Then, In 2010 came to the US for my masters and decided I had to get the super zoom cameras with certain manual settings. So, got the Kodak Z981 ($200 - 2010 BlackFriday) and enjoy the camera till date. The only complain I have about it is that it is extremely bad in low light conditions. So, I only could dream of clicking those awesome pictures you find on the internet. I again got busy with studies and work that I could not think of pursuing my hobby. Now, I finally got some time and I decided to try some dslr's out and started with the Sony alpha A57 (Instant Love) but found out that the low light performance was kinda bad through reviews. Then, started showing interest in Canon T3. Somehow, Nikon was my last choice. But, I just wanted to give it a try before I bought any camera and tried out the D3100 at a local store. This is when I really started liking Nikon (Best in class for lowlight situations) and I think there was an interest for low light photography buried deep inside of me when I was a kid ( just the fact that my first camera was not able to click in low light). So, this is when I started reading reviews and blogs and what not!! I rekindled my inner desire for photography.I decided I wanted something more professional than the D3100 and the professional full frame cameras intimidated me and that is when I decided I had to get the D5100 which is perfect for me and for my needs on the long run!! Believe me, I enjoy every thing about this camera. This is the best camera I ever had and its now helping me capture very precious shots that I could only dream of, Its making them come true!!

The 3100 didn't seem to have enough features for me. and the D7100 was too expensive for me. (I figured when i first purchased it that i'd need a little time to practice with it and play around with some of the features.)Since completing my first few classes, i no longer use any of the program modes, everything is on manual.

A couple of my classmates had the D3000 and the D3100, and those only reassure me that i got the right one.I love the the flip out screen.

I primarily enjoy landscape photography, especially sunrises and sunsets, as well as photographing nature in general (storms, animals, plants), all of which the iPhone is awful for.So I decided to get a DSLR and I knew that Nikons were pretty good. After much research I decided on this one and so far I love it.The D5100 has incredible value and bang for your buck. It's somewhere in between the D3100 and D7100 in terms of quality, but it's only a little bit more expensive than the D3100 (while offering a lot more, including significantly higher picture quality) and MUCH less expensive than the D7100, which is only slightly better. If you're looking for a high quality, non-professional camera at a reasonable price, this is the one to get. Canons are great as well, but a Nikon of equal quality tends to be a bit less pricey.I really have no complaints about this camera. The grip is nice, the design is intuitive, and it feels very sturdy and of high quality. The interface is fairly easy to pickup, with the question mark button available to anyone who isn't sure what something means (though it's not always the greatest description). My pictures almost always turn out sharp and colorful and if they don't it's usually because of user error (i.e. I didn't use the best settings for the occasion). The battery lasts surprisingly long if you turn it off when you're not using it (I've been on 5-6 hour hikes and taken over 1500 pictures with the battery still going at 2/3 bars, though I am not using the flash).A few suggestions to someone who was new to DSLR. First, the manual is your friend. I suggest learning to use M/A/S modes, as the auto modes on this can be pretty awful (e.g. the sunset one, which tends to mess up the colors). I also suggest buying a few accessories if you don't have them - obviously a memory card, a lens cleaner and cloth (really a must), a lens hood if you photograph outdoors, and possibly an inexpensive UV filter to protect the lens.In conclusion, I've had a lot of fun with this camera and it takes fantastic pictures. It's even more amazing with a higher quality lens (I suggest trying a 55-200 or 55-300 to complement the lens that the camera came with).", "Date": "May 25, 2013"}, {"Title": "Good camera - beginner photographer", "Author": "Madees", "ReviewID": "R176HV6C9PJIIB", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I purchased this camera before going on a trip to Japan in April 2013.I also purchased a 35mm lens.

I've read that it draws no power when the switch is on and is inactive, but old habits die hard.Third, the video camera function is useless to me for my purposes. With my AF lens, handheld, it's always adjusting focus and the sound of the focus motors is clearly heard in the audio. Plus there's no anti-shake.

Personally, I prefer Nikon's quality and control. The flip side is with Canon is their lens are often available on a deal (but Nikon's lens are less likely to be on deal).Assuming you have decided to go with Nikon,- If you can spend $500 extra, go buy D7000. It is absolutely the best camera you can buy right now.- If budget is important for you and still want good photographs, buy D5100 without kit lens and spend extra on lens (like Nikon 18-200mm f/3.5-5.6G AF-S ED VR II Nikkor Telephoto Zoom Lens).- If really tight on budget, just buy D5100 with kit lens. You should be OK for a while.- You will lose some very very advanced features with D5100 (as compared to D7000), but trust me you won't really miss them unless your daytime job is being professional photographer. Again, when I mean features, it's ease of control (i.e. instead of going to Menu > Select certain feature via LCD in D5100, you will have that accesible directly on the body of D7000), not better quality ... that will be determined by the quality of lens and your knowledge about photography.- Since D5200 is on its way, D5100's prices are falling steeply. So, it might be a good time to buy this (I got $250 off on camera (which is OK), but also $250 off on Nikkor lens and AmazonBasics bag + Transcend 16GB SDHC memory card for free). Another reason I bought it was I am going on an overseas trip and want to take good photographs.

Just wanted to toss out my experience with my Sigma 18-250 HSM lens that I paired up with this camera, since there doesn't seem to be any of those experiences on the internet right now.  Overall, I think that the lens combination really seems to be working well.  The lens of big and heavy, disproportionally more than the camera which is lighter than the D80 that I had.  I am purchasing the battery grip to give it a little more balance, just like I did with my D80.  Shooting-wise, it does great.  Love the clean pics up to ISO 3200, unheard of on my D80.  Using the Liveview is a little but more annoying.  It seems to struggle to autofocus when the lens is zoomed out.  I read that it needs a fast aperture to be able to do live view, and the Sigma for all of its benefits is really slow.  So, consider that if you're planning doing a lot of liveview, which I don't.  Love the articulating screen.  Don't really miss the second screen on the top of the camera.  It's not too annoying to just hit the \"info\" button if I want to know more data.  Also, the live view was really helpful for using a manual focus f/1.4 85 mm lens that I had.  I couldn't focus on anything accurately enough through the viewfinder.Anyways, just wanted to toss my data out there.

Until, that is, I went to a photography workshop directed to DSLR users where I translated the language of my film camera days to the language of modern image technology.  During the workshop I made a list of features that I wanted and started looking, finally selecting the Nikon D5100 after a couple of weeks learning what the market offered.  The Nikon D5100 was a good choice.The Nikon D5100 takes some study and the features require practice to master. For an old man (60), I am a hi-tech guy capable of learning fast and understanding technical manuals.  It has taken time and effort to get the images I want, primarily landscapes, buildings, locomotives, and oil well pumpjacks.  I am still not satisfied because I know this camera can deliver much more than my present skill level demands.  However, I know it has the capabilities to meet my needs as an amateur as my skills expand.", "Date": "April 27, 2012"}, {"Title": "The D5100, an Outstanding, Solid Camera", "Author": "Scott D. Welch", "ReviewID": "R2PRQDNV2Q38GM", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I have been shooting with the Nikon D60 10.2MP DSLR for a year and a half and have been more than satisfied with the results. It originally came with the 18-55 lens and I also got a 55-200 but those were upgraded to Nikon 18-105mm Zoom Lens and Nikon 70-300mm Zoom over the past year. I have now had the D5100 for four weeks, received for a milestone birthday, and I absolutely love it. For me it provided everything I needed without having to reach up to the D7000.The image captures from the D5100 using either the 105 or the 300 are very very high quality. The D5100 has the same image sensor as the D7000, which is a nice benefit. When I go out to shoot, I shoot. It is nothing to snap two or three hundred clicks in very short order. And very few of them do I ever have to delete while still on the memory card in the camera or discard later once downloaded to my pc or laptop.The settings and functions are easy to learn and easy to use. The additional \"Scenes\" and \"Effects\" I am still playing with but the ones I have used have delivered as Nikon promises. I still do an awful lot of landscape photography, as well as sunrise and sunset images, and the D5100 executes exceedingly well with both the 105 and 300. Very rarely do I ever end up with an under- or over-exposed image regardless of the setting or function that I use.As mentioned in my D60 review I enjoy the use of a viewfinder and even though the D5100 has liveview I still now prefer the viewfinder. Of course, using the built-in \"Selective Color\" function means I have to use liveview and that is fine. And, speaking of which, selective color works just great. I have experimented with it on various types of scenes, all hand-held without a tripod, and the results are quite remarkable considering the unit snaps two photos. That, in itself, says much about Nikon's VR capabilities.I greatly enjoy the 3\" display, over my D60's smaller one. Not just for the size, but the color clarity is superb. The addition of the articulating display was brilliant on Nikon's part as it assists framing difficult shots with relative ease.The performance of the D5100 in low-light situations, with either the 105 or 300, is outstanding. I have not yet experimented with the \"Active D-Lighting\" function that works to improve the dynamic range between low and high light, so cannot address that. Once I have done so, I shall update my review.As a final note, I am, at this point, keeping my D60, and have the 105 on one of the cameras and the 300 on the other because I just hate to take the time to change a lens and I do still get great images from the D60. However, depending on what I plan to shoot the D5100 gets first choice of lens and the D60 takes the backseat.For the money I do not think the D5100 can be beat for quality of performance.", "Date": "November 25, 2011"}, {"Title": "Just amazing", "Author": "Alex", "ReviewID": "R39TL3XO33OEOO", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This is my fourth Nikon camera, and my first DSLR.I'm coming from a pleasant experience with the Nikon P80.

I am still learning just some of the features - I had used a Minolta 35mm film SLR for 9 years, often in either aperture priority or manual, sometimes in P mode.  The D5100 has all these capabilities and much much more.  I would recommend that a new owner immediately go to the Nikon site and download the D5100 Reference Manual (about 250 pages) and save it in PDF format on your computer for when you need it.  If you later want to print the manual (I did), you'll need to input your D5100 S/N.  I used the PDF print capability to print full size pages because I wanted the bigger print.  Then I spent 20 minutes punching 3 ring binder holes and bought a decent large 3 ring binder to hold all these pages.  You can certainly learn to operate the D5100 from the User's Manual that comes in the camera box, I just like to have the ref. manual on the computer for questions I might have.I am not any kind of expert so can't compare this camera with previous DSLRs (my wife has a D40).  Nikon has always seemed to be the best (to me) so choosing Nikon  was a no brainer.  I read the reviews and decided that I'd rather pony up and get the mid priced D5100 rather than the entry level D3100.  We got a f/4-5.6G, IF-ED, AF-S, DX 55-200mm VR lens with the D40 (because I knew I wanted it) so I have that to use with my D5100 for nature shots in Florida.  I may get a 50mm f1.8 for nice close pics of bugs and flowers in low light and short depth of field.

I didn't care about the quality that much, though I did want a decent amount of megapixels and video capability. So I bought myself a Samsung SL620 point-and-shoot with 12 megapixels and SD video capability. That camera died on me 6 months later. Christmas that year, I got a new Samsung SL820, which was like the 1st only with 720p video capability. That one also quit on me, but this time after 2 months. May 2010, I got the same camera and it only lasted 3 months, but I've taken over 1,000 pics with it. By then, I was starting to get an interest in photography and taking quality shots. Last fall, I borrowed my dad's Sony F717, which was a 5 megapixel bridge camera that he's now had for 8 years. I figured out that camera in just a few days. Unlike my cameras, the Sony had manual settings and manual focus. I was impressed by the blurred backgrounds, the color not so much. I had to fix the washed out colors in Photoshop. A couple weeks after Christmas, I had made enough money to get another point-and-shoot (Bad choice). This one was a Samsung TL240, which had 14 megapixels and a touchscreen. I got some decent shots with it, but they could've been better. A couple months later, one of my friends at school accidently knocked that camera off a table and the lens got stuck. After that, I decided I was gonna save up the extra cash and get an SLR so I could get better quality shots. I looked at several different cameras on this website. Some bridge and some SLRs. I wanted one that took decent HD video (with a reasonable amount of recording time per video), had a decent resolution, and had decent low-light. By the 1st week of April, I was gonna stick with a Samsung NX10, then I saw the Nikon D5100 on Amazon, although it wasn't actually available yet. It had everything I wanted and more.Review:---------------------------------------------Photos:This camera takes very awesome pictures and I rarely need to use the flash. This camera stomps my deceased cameras and my dad's Sony into the ground. The focusing is very fast, except in live view. The articulating display is very helpful when I want to take self-portraits. I bought a remote so I could take self-portraits that were focused right. It totally beats the self-timer. The HDR feature is awesome, although it's only meant for still scenes and not action or anything with movement. I've used the 30-second shutter speed for shots after sunset and they come out quite nice. I only wish there were some longer shutter speeds. Holding down the shutter for a minute or 2 can be very annoying when using the bulb feature because I usually get some motion blur, even when I'm using a tripod. The effects are pretty awesome too. I used the sketch feature to sketch a picture of an Ingles store and I put it on Facebook saying that I drew it myself. My parents are in love with that feature. I can honestly say I haven't had any softness issues with my pictures, after I turned the sharpening up a notch. I also haven't had any problems with the reds being exaggerated. The colors are just great and this is the first camera I've had that took pictures that I didn't need to enhance in Photoshop before I upload them to Facebook.Video:The HD video on this camera is very clear, unlike the \"HD\" video on my older cameras. I bought the expensive external microphone and the sound is great and you don't hear as much of the autofocus noise. The video is a little bit wobbly when I move the camera kinda fast, but I'm pretty sure the older Nikon D5000 is much worse. Video is not my goal in life (If it were, I would've gotten a camcorder). I shoot random videos every now and then. I also have a show on Youtube that I do every once in a while.Camera in general:This camera is awesome. It may not be perfect, but no camera is or ever will be unless God makes one himself. I have absolutely no desire to return or trash this camera. It was money well-spent. Unlike the Nikon D40 (which I had borrowed from my photography teacher one time), it doesn't feel so awkward trying to get a self-portrait with just one hand. I plan on using this camera in college this fall and for a long time. Eventually, when I get rich, I'll step up to a full-frame camera. I'm not in any rush to do that though. Right now, I'm just using the kit lens included with this camera and the pictures are pretty good. I plan on getting more lens, such as the 18-200mm (for video), the 55-300mm lens, and a portrait lens.(Edit: I just realized that I can use my remote for the bulb feature.)----------------------------------------------------------------------12/7/2011 Update:I've had this camera for 6 months now and it stopped working. Just kidding. This awesome camera is still working as great as it did when I first got it out of its package on June 7th. I've dropped it a few times, being the clumsy person I am, but it didn't affect the camera. However, I had to replace my kit lens in October after accidentally hitting it on a door and later making things worse when I took it off and put it back on the wrong way. I decided to spend the extra money and get the 18-105mm lens instead of the standard 18-55mm lens I am using my camera right now in my photography classes in college. I started shooting in RAW on a regular basis in September and I gotta say, if you want to get the best out of your images, shoot in RAW. I use Lightroom and the images are much sharper than than JPGs straight from the camera. I tried Capture NX, but for some reason, the RAW images turn out like the in-camera JPGs and aren't very sharp.

I really liked my D3100, but there are 2 features I wanted that the D5100 has:  1.) bracketing function and 2.) ISO 1/3 increments.  I like HDR photography, and the 3 exposure bracketing mode makes it easier to do on the D5100 (although I wish it had a 5 exposure bracketing mode).  I take a lot of night photos, and the D3100 would only go from 800 to 1600 to 3200.  The D5100 will let you shoot at ISO 1000, 1250, 2000, etc.  The high ISO performance on the D3100 is very good, but it is outstanding/phenomenal on the D5100.  I have taken quite a few ISO 5000 and 6400 photos on the D5100 that come out awesome with almost no noise, even with the stock lens.  I recently took a photo at ISO 5000 and posted on flickr that looks like ISO 200 on almost any other camera I have ever used, including my Panasonic GH1.  I will share it on Amazon.  I believe the incredible low light, high ISO performance is because the D5100 shares the same sensor as the D7000.  So this is a big upgrade from the D3100 as far as the sensor in low light environments.  I have taken about 500 photos so far, and pictures come out tack sharp with the stock lens.  Combined with the 35 mm F1.8 Nikon lens, the camera takes as fantastic of pictures as I could possibly imagine.  Battery life is incredible--after 500 pics the battery indicator still showed the full 3 bars.  I also like the adjustable swivel screen for when I am shooting on a tripod or above my head.  The one thing I do not like about the camera are the placement of the buttons and settings.  There is not a button for ISO; you have to press the \"i\" button then scroll down on the screen and change it.  You could assign ISO to the Fn button (which is in a difficult location on the left side of the camera), but then you can't set the camera to a 2 second self-timer without going through the menu.  I use the 2 second timer a lot for shooting on a tripod at night, so I didn't change the Fn button.  On the D3100, the self timer was on a switch on the top; not sure why they removed that.  Overall the controls are somewhat cumbersome in the dark without looking at the camera.  I am getting used to them, but they could make it easier.  Finally, the D5100 does not autofocus on older Nikon lenses like the D7000 does.  But I think the picture quality of the D5100 is probably equal to the D7000 because they use the same sensor.  Other than the controls/button placement issue, I love this camera and highly recommend it.  I think it is certainly worth the 200 dollars more than the D3100 if you are considering between the 2.", "Date": "June 24, 2011"}, {"Title": "Wows me every time I press the shutter button", "Author": "Gabriel Young", "ReviewID": "R2JJTREV8DF3JP", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Let me first say that this is my first DSLR. I take about 10,000 pictures a year and I figured it's time for me to upgrade to a decent SLR.I always cringed at SLRs since I never want the burden of carrying it around. I figured that a camera wouldn't do me any good if didn't want to take it anywhere. That being said, although I still use a very nice point-and-shoot for many quick trips with my kids, for birthday parties and other big events, I want the crispest, most colorful, pictures I can take. Here's why I love this camera:-PICTURES-Since it uses the same sensor as the Nikon D7000, which costs significantly more, the pictures are incredible for its class. You literally cannot buy a camera that takes better pictures at this price point. Compared with the Canon T3i, which is a direct competitor, I believe these pictures are better indoors and in low light. Also, a quick tip: for most pics, JPEG basic setting (~400kb) is fine for 4x6 and JPEG normal setting (~1mb) is fine for 8x10.-VIDEO-I don't use this for video often but it captures HD video. I prefer to use an HD camcorder for video but from time to time when I only have this, I'll take a few short vids and they look great.-SIZE/FORM-The Nikon D5100's body is slightly smaller than the Canon T3i's. Although my hands are on the larger side, I prefer the smaller body and it fits well. I use Opteka Professional Wrist Grip Strap for Digital & Film SLR Cameras with the camera and it feels like it's an extension of my hand. A side note: If you choose that hand strap, you'll need to cut a notch off the bottom to allow you to swing the screen out (I have a review there that details how I got that hand strap to work for me).-SPECIAL FEATURES (HARDWARE)-A 3\" swing out screen! That's what initially led me to choose the D5100 over the D3100. This is great to capture different angles and ideal for self-shots that I take with my kids. As a bonus, you can also \"close\" the screen to protect it if you're going to use the viewfinder. Of course, now that I have this model, I'm thrilled that I have better pictures.-SPECIAL FEATURES (SOFTWARE)-Lots of special effects on here! My kids love the Selective Color (B&W; pic with a color highlight) and Color Sketch (cartoonish look) options. Personally, I use High Key a lot for dark situations when I don't want to use the flash. After the shot, I also occasionally crop the pics right on the camera.-USER-FRIENDLINESS-I consider myself slightly more knowledgeable than a beginner but I can even set it up for my wife to use. Simply use as many or as few of the features as you need. If you're ready to learn, the Nikon D5100 is an amazing, somewhat intuitive tool.-RECOMMENDATION-If you can afford it, the Nikon D5100 is a great high-end starter camera. You will grow into it and for the majority of us (non-pros), this will be more than adequate for our needs for the long term so you won't need to upgrade to another SLR.

Having built-in HDR is a big plus for high contrast shots. 1080p video is just as good (if not better) than any dedicated HD camcorder. The higher resolution screen makes it much easier to evaluate shots. Being able to swivel the screen is also a major upgrade especially when you are trying to shoot at wierd angles. The in-camera special effects can be called \"gimmicky\" but they really are fun to use and will spice up any photos.If you are going to spend $600 on the D3100 you might as well bump that up to $900 for the D5100.

The 5100 has much better image quality and does a way better job in low light over the D200. I do prefer the size of my D50 to the 5100, though I have big bear hands so maybe that's the reason. The 5100 also lacks an internal focusing motor, so several of my lenses that work fine on my D50 will only work in manual mode on the 5100, which wouldn't be a big deal except i find going into manual mode much easier and faster on the D50 than the 5100. I think that is on purpose as the 5100 is more of a consumer camera vs an enthusiast or semi pro camera. Full disclosure: I just bought the new D7100 and flippin love it. I upgraded because I want a more robust body and faster autofocus and faster period, and the D7100 does all that.

The images that it can produce are about as good as one could ask for, assuming that the photographer does his part.

Thought about it for a year and a couple of weeks ago decided to go for it. (Something about impending holidays triggers the camera buying urge.) Since I had all the lenses I needed I bought the body only, saving about $100 over the kit price.As expected, it was a great upgrade. What I wasn't expecting was the improvement in full auto mode. I'm able to take decent photos now under conditions the D5000 complained about or didn't do well in. Since I take more photos in full auto mode than not, this is a nice bonus. (I'm not adverse to fussing with shutter speed, aperture, etc., and you can certainly do that all you want with this camera, but I take a lot of casual photos.)If I were buying this as my first Nikon I'd probably buy the body and pay a couple of hundred extra for the 18-105 mm zoom rather than get the kit with the 18-55 zoom. It's a better walking around lens in my opinion. I might also buy the 35mm f1.8 prime lens for low light/indoor shots (or extra crispy shots of any kind). Those were the two lenses I bought when I got my D5000 and I use them the most. (Another useful lens that's reasonably priced is the Tokina 12-24 f4 zoom.)The only (minor) complaint I have is that my non-Nikon TTL flash unit doesn't work properly with the D5100. I get badly overexposed shots with anything other than straight-up, off the ceiling bounce. Probably time to look at getting a real Nikon flash unit.Update on the flash unit problem. My Polaroid brand TTL flash and the D5100's full auto setting don't get along. It works fine in Program mode, though. On the D5000 it worked in either mode, but apparently there is a subtle difference in the D5100 interface. The flash tracks the zoom and aperture, but either the flash is firing at full power or the camera's auto mode is not aware the flash is going to fire and sets up for available light. Newer Polaroid flash units than mine might work better with the D5100.", "Date": "December 29, 2012"}, {"Title": "Fantastic Camera", "Author": "Amazon Customer \"Todd A Mead\"", "ReviewID": "R1FP2ASKJHJ6RO", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I have had several high quality consumer cameras over the past 10 years or more.

I use to carry a ultra compact camera or my DV camcorder to shoot video and would have to switch cameras. The camera is great for stills. The big problem with DSLRs is the auto focus during video. The D5100 focuses quickly, but unfortunately hunts for its subject in a pattern of 4 adjustments. It focuses slight in front of subject, then behind, then in front, and finally on the subject. This creates a distracting \"in and out\" of focus pattern that I felt was unacceptable. The auto focus function is also noisy and easily picked up on the build in mic. An external mic would be needed for decent sound capture if using auto focus. The D5100 can focus in single shot mode. Meaning you can depress the shutter button to refocus when needed.

I pre-ordered both then dropped D7000 due to its high price. I regret this decision until D5100 came up. However, after reading a review from the Nikon D5100 w/ kit lens, I paused for a while to purchase this camera. The review was 4-star, talking about the swivel screen, HDR in camera processing, and feel cheap.But now, the price of D5100 is down to a level that I can't resist. For the price of one D7000, I can have both D3100 & D5100 give and take of $100. I have many lenses and accessories in common. D3100 is a good back-up system.To defense the previous review arguments, I list my personal favorable reasons as following.(1) I use a screen protector on the swivel screen and flip it out all the time. I don't worry about it being scratched. After swivelled use, I reset it to this normal position immediately.(2) HDR in camera process works quite well. It is better than Photoshop HDR 3-photo process. Many people are frustrated with SONY's HDR process. They feel that the processed images are too artifact. Not here with Nikon. I posted 2 images on this product's photo with notes. The key of getting the good image is steady hands or using a tripod. Use spot-metering instead of matrix metering is also a good tip.

I recommend the DX AF-S 35mm 1:1.8G lens at fairly low cost to achieve excellent indoor and lower light results.As far as being a video camera goes, if you want to record quality videos I'd recommend you purchase a quality video camera.The flip out screen is an somewhat aggravating gadget to me, but if you are hell bent on using the camera for video I'd say it makes sense in that regard.With respect to the kit 18-55 lens, it's light weight and for a hundred bucks brand new just can't be beat.

The features of the D5100 are easy to deploy in general photography, without the usual complexity of figuring how to deploy them. This is why I bought the camera. It's just easy to use the relatively advanced features.The Hi1 and Hi2 ISO modes are useful when you need to capture images at lower quality in lower light, and the high grain effect of the ISO 102,000 is a lot of fun. The in-camera editing capability is fun, but doesn't replace in-computer editing functionality. It's handy nonetheless if you need to do edit images quickly after shooting, before uploading them online, for example.For a first time Nikon Digital SLR user, the position of the buttons, Live View etc are very intuitive and the redeployed buttons don't pose the challenge that users of older Nikon DSLR models claim. The LCD Viewfinder is as good as other reviewers have commented and while the Depth of Field preview is missing, the LCD screen preview works (for me anyway). Being able to assign the ISO Level to the button beside the flash button makes it even easier to use the camera without having to navigate the menus to get the right shot settings.The kit lens is OK as a starter lens, and I agree with other reviewers that you'll want to add better lenses to take advantage of the amazing images this camera is capable of producing.

Practically some of the issues I have found with my d3000 include a slow internal computer (so images take a while to process enough to be able to review them on the screen), slow autofocus and limited ISO range. All of these are far better in the d5100.You should be aware of a few things. 1.) When in video mode the aperture settings will say that they are changing but in actuality the aperture will stay the same. You need to go out of live view, change the aperture and then go back into live view. Once live view is on aperture does not change. 2.) Don't shoot with live view, bro. It is far slower than shooting through the viewfinder, the exposure that is shown on the screen isn't always accurate and when you hit the shutter it takes about a second before the camera will capture your image. Live view shouldn't sell this camera for you. 3.) Finally, the area around the memory card slot gets really overheated when you are shooting video for a long period of time. I haven't had any issues yet but I am worried about what that is doing to the camera and the card.I love this thing, and if I had the money I would buy myself one personally.

I did a few months of research, and realized that the two main contenders to suit my pocket was the Canon T3I and the Nikon D5100.T3I Vs D5100I read every article, watched every video on youtube that spoke about these two cameras and it all comes down to this: if you place your MAIN emphasis on capturing excellent stills, and you love the convenience of video but not into it seriously, then the D5100 is the camera for you. It allows you to take more useable picutes at the higher ISOs than the T3I and you get a longer battery life as well. If however, you want the brilliant pictures, and are a little more serious about videos, the manual controls offered by the T3I gives it the edge as it relates to video.D5100 PROS- Brilliant picture quality- it takes a little bit of tweaking to get it just right, but when you do, the pictures are stunning.- The build quality is good for its price range- personally, after holding both this and the T3I in my hands, i preferred the feel of the D5100 esp around the grip area.- Ease of use- as my first DSLR camera, i found it easy enough to use once you get a hang of the controls- Tilt screen- this is one of my favorite features, because it allows you to capture certain angles without having to lie flat on the ground all the time, or climb a tree- Noise profile- i found that i was able to get useable pictures at ISOs higher than 1600D5100 CONS- No built in autofocus mechanism- i found that this limited the number of lenses that could be used on the camera- No dedicated ISO button- this is such an important feature, i thought that it earned the right to have its own dedicated buttonCONCLUSIONAfter having done all the research, and deciding eventually to buy the D5100 over the T3I, i have not regretted my purchase. i think that the advantages stated above, more than compensates for the challenges faced with this camera. As the camera that has introduced me to DSLR photography, i think i am in capable hands, and have already produced pictures that people feel can easily make it to a magazine.

I was looking for something that will meet my needs, something for my level of \u201cprofessionalism\u201d and something that will be easy to learn.And I am glad that I did the right choice. This camera is that and so much more.One of the first things that will help you to understand your camera is the menu. Is simple and self-explanatory.  As well as the manual.I am type of person who doesn\u2019t want to shoot at \u201cauto\u201d mode (that was the reason I switched from point-and-shoot cameras), so I am playing a lot with the Professional modes (M,A,S, P). Do understand all this modes better; I was using the book \u201cNikon D5100 \u2013 From Snapshots To Great Shots\u201d, by Rob Sylvan.Although the manual that comes with the camera, as I said, is doing a great job \u2013 this is also a \u201cmust have book\u201d for this camera.It\u2019s free to download in PDF version.It\u2019s not easy to adjust the proper settings at various situations, tough\u2026but with good practice, your Nikon will deliver excellent photos. I purchased this camera together with 18-55 kit lens.  And I expected to be heavier that they actually are, but no\u2026the camera body fits perfectly in your arms.The photo quality is excellent (I put my setting to shoot large files) and the HD Video as well. I was really surprised by the microphone \u2013 I guess I am used to my microphone from point-and-shoot cameras, so I was happy to find that this one actually records perfect audio.The truth is, I cannot compare this camera with any other from this kind. Like I said, it\u2019s my first.But for the money wise, quality of photos and the kit lenses  \u2013 it\u2019s just perfect.Also, the flip screen was one of the reasons I decide for this camera ( I found out that not many cameras have this) \u2013 which is very helpful when shooting from ground level (which I do)As you will read in many books and magazines (which I highly recommend when buying this kind of camera) \u2013 the camera itself will not make you better photographer. Playing with it, practicing and spending time behind it, however \u2013 it will.I hope my review helped to someone who is in dilemma what to buy.When I will became an expert in few months & years, I will write again :)Cheers!", "Date": "December 29, 2013"}, {"Title": "Great buy!", "Author": "Nain", "ReviewID": "R2YCUHTUXBB6OW", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I bought this camera as my first (and only) DSLR.

The thing that sold me was that the sensor was the same as in the D7000 but the price was a lot different.  The sensor is the heart of the DSLR, and the D100 delivers.  There are some neat features on it and some that are ok.  Mainly I bought this for when I don't want to carry a bigger heavier camera around all day.  The 55-200 is a decent street sweeper type lens and it is pretty sharp.  I rarely use the 18-55 except for wide angle shots.If you decide to get this, you'll have a camera that can produce some good results without having to do much editing at all.  One accessory I would pick up is a Nikon SB-400 flash for it, the on camera flash is just not powerful enough, but it does a decent job as a fill in flash.  One thing I really liked was that you could put up a grid pattern on the screen.Compared to a D-3, or even a D-2, well there is no comparison, you can't compare a pro series all metal weatherproof camera to a entry level or pro-sumer camera.

I don't know how many people reviewing these sony cameras print their pictures, but I do and the pictures always had a lot of noise in dark areas, weren't sharp, the colors were never vibrant, and I normally had to edit the crap outta them to make them look like they weren't taken with my iphone. They looked slightly better on a screen, but once printed- I would have about one good picture out of 100. And that was the a55. I thought I had just got a lemon or something, since it has so many raving reviews.So! I had a bestbuy warranty and broke the a55 after two and a half years, and because I had a sony zoom lens I could do nothing with, i decided to be upgraded to the a65. Even with a poor experience with the a55, I was so thrilled to get the a65, thinking It would be a better dslt, and I have to say it was worst as far as picture quality goes. Edges not sharp whatsoever [which is the main thing I look for in a photo], colors are faded, when I print the pictures it looks like an iPhone took them. I know how to use a camera, I tried different times of day and different settings. Also, I'm printing the pictures at an actual photo lab. I could get better pictures with a canon sx260.I was very very unhappy with the picture quality, and I showed about 6 other people the pictures and literally all of they agreed. Same terrible noise and grain in dark areas like the a55,, blurry, faded colors. The dark areas don't even have to be that dark to get noise. The pictures look beautiful on the bright LCD screen, but it's a big difference than what your actually getting.However! Some things I did like about it was how easy it is to use, it explains everything as you go through the settings [great for beginners]; how friggin fast it is (which is the first thing I noticed when I took my first picture), and the body IMO feels very sturdy.  Also, the viewfinder to lcd screen with just your eye is a nice feature. Or was that the a55? i dont remember. Besides those things, i was extremely dissapointed, and I returned it and stood at bestbuy  for half an hour debating between the nikon d5100, d5200, and d7000. I want the d7000, but it was out of my price range, so I got the d5100 to just try out a nikon; and mannn, what a difference. Huge huge huge difference. It's cheaper then the a65, and so much better as far as picture quality goes. I was flipping through some pictures last night, and they are so so vibrant and crisp without editing them. On my computer, I was flipping backwards through my pictures and all the sudden the pictures got ugly and I was like, \"what happened with that one in all these beautiful ones?\" And I realized it got into pictures from the a65.Im really feeling the nikon, but I will be returning it as well, this time I'm gonna get the d7000 and take the price hit, because the body of the nikon feels very cheap. I've had it a week and the battery cover won't open. Also, you have to turn a nob on the top of the camera to switch from viewfinder to LCD every time the camera turns on, and I don't use the viewfinder and that's inconvenient for me and made me miss a picture yesterday. The camera is 4fps i believe, and it is a tid bit slow if your thinking about using it for sports. Maybe you can buy a lens. Idk.And one last thing negative about the nikon is I personally don't like the Double shutter noise it makes every picture you take. Besides those, though, the picture quality is so far impressive. ive only printed a few, but they werent too shabby either. I buy a camera for the pictures, really, and if you do too, you will notice a difference in a sony vs. a nikon. I didn't think it would be a big difference when I originally bought the a55, but I regret that choice three years ago. I've wasted hundreds of pictures IMO not using a nikon.These are all my personal experiences and opinions. I don't do anything professional with photography, I just like taking pretty pictures :) and am kind of particular I guess. I'm planning on posting this on the other cameras reviews, too, in hope of helping someone else.

Overall I've been happy - it focuses far more quickly, offers higher ISO (by quite a bit) and is much less grainy in comparable low-light conditions than the camera it replaced.The pivoting screen with Live View (a feature the D3000 does not have) was also a feature I wanted, however I'm mixed on it.  No problems yet but I fear for the hinge as it seems like the most fragile part on the camera.  I love that you can use Live View and the screen to capture from creative angles (or lose less shots to a bad guess) but find myself regularly debating between the quicker viewfinder option or the LV one.  Given that I generally have the screen folded in to protect the LCD more times than not I use the viewfinder then glance down to check out the shot (as I was used to with the D3000) only to see the plastic backing panel.  I think time and practice will address that.All in all it's solid - I've yet to play with the \"Scene\" options or really dig into the manual settings but it's definitely an upgrade from a D3000 (which I was very happy with) and it's been seamless with all my lenses and accessories.

You can get more technical analysis on that on any site like dpreview, so am not getting into that.One of the very useful feature for this camera is the vari-angle LCD viewfinder. In cases where the camera is awkwardly put on a tripod and you are unable to use the OVF, this can be an extremely useful feature. The kit lens (18-55mm f3.5/5.6 VC) that comes with it is amazing. Its extremely sharp, has fast and near silent autofocus and works well when used wide at 18 mm. When wide open, I have noticed slight overall softness in the lens, but that can be very easily corrected in photomatix that I use.The camera flash and the flash compensation work like a charm and so far have produced excellent lighting results for me. As an amateur, you get a lot of stuff to play with in the manual mode, starting from the obvious aperture and shutter speed control to exposure/flash compensation and many other stuff like controlling the white balance. The IR port makes remote shutter release cable free and long exposure shots a child's play.I haven't tried shooting video with it yet.

They do NOT allow flash photos PERIOD when inside the buildings and we were a little apprehensive about the results of NON flash pictures.  We worried for NO reason.  The camera compensated EXTREMELY well and we are VERY happy with the results.  I took off one star because the camera is not completely intuitive in it's operation.  As always, just like in cars, whomever designs these things COMPLETELY understands how they work but isn't necessarily in touch with the rest of us.  In its favor, it seems, at this point, that it would be a little more difficult to mess things up - so points FOR this camera.  Like everything else, as we become more accustomed to using it, we'll CERTAINLY appreciate its true potential.  This is not our first Nikon (we replaced a D50) and likely will not be our last.  We think there's enough ability in this camera to satisfy nearly anyone (amatuer to near pro) and it IS a good price.  One thing to remember though:  Just like a computer, you must tell it what you want it to do before it will do it.  Once it knows what you want, it performs very well.UPDATE #1:  Just for whatever it's worth, older Nikon DSLR lenses with auto focus may NOT work (as ours didn't).  You may want to take this into consideration . . .  Perhaps you would want to purchase new basic lenses to go with this camera.UPDATE #2:  We have also learned that, as I've read in other reviews on this camera, that the flash is a little weak compared to the D3100, D3200, and our trusty D50.

I use transmitter lapel mics on talent which moves or requires freedom of movement. This was a biggie for me. I bought the camera with an 18-55mm lens and not real happy with the glass. I plan to buy a 35mm 1.8 in the near future for clearer shots. The sensitivity of the D5100 in low light is I think hindered by this lens and I'm hoping the 35mm 1.8 will give me the almost 2 stops better sensitivity. I recently purchased the remote and hope there is more than just a snapshot control. I would have liked a nylon 1' lens-cap lead I could easily remove with a snap release but the camera came with none.

I selected Adobe raw thinking my Photoshop CS2 would then accept the pic but was sadly mistaken. I think all these new SLRs cameras should be able to produce pics with TIFF outputs so conversions are not necessary. Unfortunately versions of PS below PS3 are not upgradable.

For a majority of my portrait work, I use the Nikon 50mm and although it works with the 5100, there is no auto focus.  But, I must say, the focus bar on the 5100 is awesome.

Ten years ago cameras like these would have cost several THOUSANDS of dollars, so regardless of what anyone tells you, these cameras are both good and both offer what would have been professional quality and features just a few years back.We also have a D3100 and a very awesome D7100. This is the reason we stay with Nikon... the ability to share lenses and other accessories saves a lot of money. If our first camera had been a Canon or Pentax instead, we might own a bunch of Canon or Pentax cameras right now, except that Canon does not have any camera that can compete with the D7100 anywhere near that price range, and Pentax was significantly more expensive than both the Canon and Nikon cameras we were considering when we got our first camera. Canon's closest camera to the D7100 cost 3 times more than the D7100, so in that respect Nikon smashes Canon.I would have bought 2 D7100's instead of a D7100 and a D5100, but the D7100 does not have a moveable screen like the D5100 does, and that was an issue. The D7100 is a far superior camera to the D5100, so if the moveable screen is not an issue and you can afford to spend roughly double the amount of the D5100 than I would definitely recommend the D7100 over the D5100.The D5100 fills a need for us and we are happy with it. It is a very capable piece of equipment and the quality is on par with the best of the cameras in its price range.If you are having trouble deciding what brand of camera to go with, the truth of the matter is that virtually all of the big name camera companies like Pentax, Nikon, Canon and others make truly great cameras. The biggest reason why we went with Nikon is the wide range of lenses and other accessories and the prices of those items compared to other competing companies.If we could afford it, we would own cameras from all 3 of those companies, because they all make cameras that we want. But like for many other people out there, money is an issue. I had to make a decision in regards to the best balance of quality and price (for us), both now and down the road as our equipment arsenal expands. For this reason I chose Nikon.I actually plan on buying cameras from both Canon and Pentax in the future as they both have cameras that are great, and our Nikon collection will continue to grow as well with some higher end cameras as the need arises.I hope that this honest review has helped!", "Date": "October 15, 2013"}, {"Title": "Camera's", "Author": "Creighton", "ReviewID": "R31AP4BWCH8AGP", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This is the best camera I have ever owned,bar none.

I also had a closet full of film, Pan-X and Tri-X for black and white, Kodachrome and Ektachrome for slides, Kodacolor for color prints.  Then Kodak starting discontinuing films, when Kodachrome went away I knew I had to join the digital revolution.I was always an Olympus guy, due to the high quality of Zuiko lenses at a lower price than Nikon's Nikkor lenses.  Since Olympus has pretty much abandoned the Digital SLR market to Nikon and Cannon, I chose the D5100 for a few reasons.  First Nikkor lenses, and second the D5100 features the same sensor as the D7000 at a much more affordable price.I've had the D5100 with the 18-55 VR and 55-200 VR lenses for about a month.  I've taken about 500 photos, ranging from a kid's indoor birthday party to a cavern system.  I figured being a pretty decent amateur photographer I could just pick up the D5100 and snap away.  Turned out I needed to read the manual and learn the scene modes.  When I did I am amazed by the quality of photos I was able to take.

The only Canon camera that I loved was the 60D but is very expensive for me ($ 1000), I believe that Canon is more to a professional level, that is, to dare to buy any of the 5D Mark but at a lower level other brands Nikon, Sony and Pentax are better. I liked the Pentax K-5 and K-30 mainly because they are practically immune to water, dust and extreme conditions (which gives them great advantage over other brands), but I fall on the same theme money are cameras over $ 900, and are therefore out of reach.So stay in the range of Nikon and Sony whose excellent performance at a lower price level of professionalism and superior to all other brands. I have to note that by Nikon took into account the D3200 and D5100 and by Sony A580 only (this because of information supplied by people DxOMark about the \"low noise at high ISO\"). The Sony A580 was out of competition due to increased price of $ 850 to over $ 900 while for example the D5100 down to $ 650, almost $ 300 less. I must report that I began to consider Sony's NEX series, especially the new NEX-F3 (the characteristic \"bounce flash\" and a folding screen to take you forward your own pictures was what I liked), but , also I gave up because I said to myself, for just $ 50 more would take a more serious and professional equipment like the Nikon D5100!.Anyway, I was the fight between the D5100 and D3200, this was the final battle (the hardest and most difficult of all) by the side of the D3200 had a new processor Xpeed 3, a 24MP sensor and a menu of friendly options for beginners like me. On the side of the D5100 had a 360 \u00b0 rotatable screen, a device a step up professionally and special effects systems like HDR. All this fight for a little difference of $ 50!. I finally ended up deciding for the D5100 compared to D3200 for two reasons: The screen can be rotated (helps me sometimes to take pictures of my little daughter just months old) and $ 50 less than I paid for it that were used to purchase an accessory , the SB-400 (do not forget to buy it, is very good and help a thousand times the flash with the camera by default).I hope my experience captured here will help them do.", "Date": "July 11, 2012"}, {"Title": "Nikon for life.", "Author": "tylerj57", "ReviewID": "R460D8Q92DNWG", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Bought this camera about 8 months ago from Costco.

I couldn't afford the next level up so this is it. Honestly, I still have a ton to learn and so far this camera is superb. The thing that really has me convinced is that when I used a trial edition of adobe Lightroom 4 the actual shot photo (to me) looks better than what they are trying to change it to. Granted I still have a lot to learn but just going by what I see when I compare the photos so not sure about software too much. But my naked eye tells me there are times when there is no reason to change the tone or white balance as this camera photo looks better than the auto settings in Lightroom on most, not all, occasions.

I've always used Canon equipment since my high school days MANY moons ago, starting with the Canon A1. I read through the reviews of the latest Canon Rebel T3i and the Nikon D5100.  With a tight budget, and wanting to check \"the other side\", I decided on a refurbished D5100 package with the 18-55 and 55-200mm Nikkor lens kit.The other reviews here go into a great deal of detail, so I won't repeat.  They are mostly accurate.  As a Canon owner and devotee, my short summary is this:1. The Canon T3i is built a bit better a bit less flimsy and feels more \"Pro\", but the Nikon D5100 is lighter and a little easier to carry around.  The Nikon Quality is good, but a little more \"Consumer\" feeling.2. There is no extended grip/battery attachment from Nikon.  Some third party grips are available, but they require an external cable to link the grip to the camera, in order to use the optional release button on the grip.  Not a show stopper, but a bit annoying if you want to put a more \"Pro\" package together.3. As many of the reviews point out, their is no dedicated ISO selector, you have to go into the menus.  However, you can assign ISO functions to a customizable function button on the front of the camera near the left grip.  I did not find this to be a big deal.4. I found the menus and options, along with the large bright LCD display to be very user friendly.  There is built in help for just about every option, and the graphic display is informative and helpful.5. The end result, the photos, I found to be extremely nice.  It is subjective, but I feel the resulting images are a tick above the Canon, especially at low ISO settings.  I have a Schnauzer with a very dark coat, and had a terrible time getting good shots of her indoors with the Canon.  The Nikon gave me great photos of her out of the box in full auto mode.  I was impressed.Conclusion:I really like the Nikon, and believe that for the average hobbyist photographer it will take great photos.  I personally like the resulting images a little better then those of my Canon, and I found the camera a little easier to use out of the box.  I like the fact that it is lighter and more compact then the Canon.  On the other hand, the Canon is built a bit better, has easier access to more advanced settings, and is a little more professional when expanding with an battery/grip and remote flash control.  The Nikon can be had for $100 to $250 less for an equivalent package to the Canon T3i.  I would say for your average hobbyist/non-Pro user the Nikon is an overall great value and will get you better photos with less effort.  The Canon is no slouch, but is aimed at a user that wants to tweak things more on a more regular basis and for those that may require a slightly more durable piece of hardware.", "Date": "February 15, 2012"}, {"Title": "Great Camera", "Author": "shannonjohnson", "ReviewID": "RQ8YBE7GRGMQO", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I love this camera.

Why?  The D3100 was a great, inexpensive camera that took wonderful pictures.  But I soon realized it lacked some features I truly wanted.  The main feature I wanted that the D3100 lacked, was bracketing, so I can use the Photomatix program more easily to do HDR photography.  It was well worth a few hundred bucks more, for me.  The rest of it is just gravy, but I also like the added tilt/swivel display, infrared sensors for the remote control, and the in-camera high dynamic range photography.

All controls are freaking easy to understand; ease of use is stunningly great because of the extra buttons placed on the right places to get quickly into the desired menus in split seconds. You don't need to browse through all the menus to get to the place that you need. Most of the configurations are only 3-4 clicks away.The 18-55 nikkor lens that comes with this is giving perfect pictures. The vibration reduction feature build into this, in my opinion is just a plus, not a necessity on a low zoom lens. I'm using a manual focus super zoom 28-300 Sigma along with this. Sigma 28-300mm f/3.5-6.3 DG Macro Aspherical Lens for Nikon AFD Cameras which is giving fabulous pictures with no shakes up to, may be, 100-150. Changing lens is just a piece of cake. The built of the body is perfect for me to get the finest possible hold and grip.One other thing that i was skeptical about is the d-movie. It didn't disappoint me at all, no jerks, no zoom issues while recoding (you can zoom, and continuous auto-focus does work!).What makes me impressed is the built-in \"effects\" feature. You can take those pictures which was once possible only by seasoned professional photographers!!! Just go over the guide and tutor videos any newbie can take better than average pictures within no time; no kidding!It is worth commenting about the battery. In 1.5 hrs you will get it fully charged! Haven't gone on a day long trip yet, to know how long does the power lasts on continuous shooting. But, by far, it is giving me reasonably good mileage.What I'm missing================1) Command dial could have been bit more intelligent. If i want to set the aperture or shutter speed it requires several turns.. rather it could have made touch sensitive to go faster if i dial it faster.2) Two more buttons; like zoom buttons in point-n-shoot cameras to control ISO.", "Date": "December 18, 2011"}, {"Title": "Can I give it 6 stars?", "Author": "J.

My old Canon PowerShot G2 takes great photos too, except indoors, but at 4 MP, it was definitely time to upgrade!I like the feel of the camera.  It's not too heavy to carry around  but not cheap and plasticky feeling either.  Some of the less exepensive DSLR's have that cheapy feeling, so I decided to spend more to hopefully get better quality and I'm not disappointed.  Even with a heavy lense it remains balanced. I'm sure I'll get used to it but some of the buttons seem to be in less than intuitive locations.  I'm still getting used to the menu too.  Again coming from Canon, there's a learning curve but I'll get the hang of it.If you're like me and you're tired of the cruddy picture quality point and shoot cameras produce indoors, then this is what you're looking for!

I started with the legendary Nikon FM2n film camera in B&W; photography class. It was almost a purely mechanical camera, except there was a small lithium ion battery to power the meter. Back in the days of mechanical cameras, you had to stick in the film, pull out the tab and line it up with the notches, then use the level to roll it to the first shot. After every shot, you had to pull another lever to advance it. There were times when I didn't notch the film correctly and I'd end up taking all my pictures on one shot of the film; never knowing it until I got it developed. You also had to adjust the aperture and shutting speed manual with the two dials, while looking through your viewfinder trying to spot the +,0,- signs.  But taking pictures with mechanical cameras wasn't the hard part. It was all the time spent in complete darkness in a closet to unroll the film canister and dropping it in container to develop your film; all in the dark. If your solution wasn't mixed properly, your film would be overexposed or completely useless. Those were the times.Fast forward to the Nikon D5100 modern DSLR. It's not only a digital camera, it's also a digital camcorder, and a limited digital dark room that allows you to do some tuning on your photos in the camera itself. This camera starts up and gets shots off fast. If you don't like to think, put it in auto and it'll think for you. If you like to think 'a little', put it in Aperture mode and it'll calculate the shutter speed for you. I've had the D50 previously and I thought I would miss the ISO button, top LCD, and various other buttons. Once I get it started, I've concluded there were way too many bonuses that outweighed the cons of upgrading. The settings panel activted by the \"i\" button allows you to change frequently used settings very quickly. In the D50 you had to drill down to these menu items. I only miss the ISO button but you can assign that to the terribly placed 'fn' button next to the flash. The 'record' button is also terribly placed btw. I'm fine with all the other placements of the buttons and the screen is just incredible on this. The 16MP sensor is outstanding in detail and low light shooting. The movie mode does not allow you to change F-stops or shutter speeds in the middle of recording. You must stop if you want to change those settings when shooting video. I find the auto focus picks up a lot of lens noise, best if you manual focus and the beautifully sharp screen makes it easy to MF indoors and in the shade. As for the software View NX2, it's not bad for developing RAW. It brings out good detail and shows you the picture it was meant to be seen. It does not have any noise removal features or sensor dust masking. It has most of the basic controls like exposure compensation, white balance, and cropping. It has no history feature. You can export the RAW as a loseless TIFF, where you can continue your editing in say Photoshop or Lightroom should you need advanced tools.Flash is limited to 1/200s and there is no high speed flash synchronization. There is also no remote command of flashes (flashes not attached to the hot shoe).The pictures out of the camera were a bit oversaturated for my tastes, resulting in images that looked over processed and dark areas losing detail. I experimented quite a while trying to figure out how to tune the JPG pictures you get out of the camera. My setting below will give you more natural pictures with a slight hint of color saturation and slight warmth in tone.Standard picture setting+6 sharpening-1 contrast-1 saturationOverall, a superbly designed camera.", "Date": "October 12, 2011"}, {"Title": "Awesome Camera!", "Author": "Rajan Chellappa \"Bay Area Parent\"", "ReviewID": "R3D5I6AUX6ET8J", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I got this camera just before my daughter's birthday.

I like the texture of the body better than the D3100. My specifications were that it had to last a few years, it needed to withstand some wear and tear, it needed quality pictures and videos, but also ease of use. And because it is my first DSLR, I am a little confused with the usage, but I'll learn. I know it takes a lot of practice and a few terrible pictures. I find the Nikon manual very clear and helpful. I do love that it's not a thick, giant camera and it's light and easy to hold with my tiny hands. I did so some research to see that the buttons were placed differently from the D3100, but I find them easy to locate and understand their meaning because it is my first. It takes some awesome shots. Fast. 4fps is very nice to get those quick shots. Crisp, detailed, clean. I haven't had much time of playing around with the special effects. I believe that my current settings are on manual. I'm not a big fan of automatic mode. I had a digital camera and that mode was pretty terrible. And I don't want to miss any special shots on auto-mode. Overall, I would recommend this camera. The price is a bit much for pretty much a step up starter camera. It has come down from $899, but by $40. I would recommend this.

Sag \"Computer Enthusiast\"", "ReviewID": "R1ZAF4L2MDF2GA", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "The Nikon D5100 was the 4th camera in line of cameras I wanted to get. Initially, I was looking at a D3100 and then realized that I could get a T2i for the same price. After seeing that, I was about to purchase a T2i until the catastrophe in Japan occurred and I was SOL and had to buy a T3i. Okay, fine. I then was about to buy the T3i when I saw the rumored release date/specs of the D5100. After that, i had to wait it out until the D5100 came out. And let me tell you, the D5100 out classes all of them in every single way. The D5100 has so many added features on top of the expected ones that it really makes shooting with this camera fun and exciting.The body feels very comfortable in the hand and if it were any smaller, it would be hard to hold but at the same time if it were any bigger it would likely result in a cumbersome body. The controls have been moved all over the place because of the articulating display, which is actually pretty awesome. I didn't really think i needed an articulating display until I realized how many more shots are easier now that I don't have to have my face directly to the viewfinder all the time. I also really enjoyed all of the special effects in the camera as well as the 11 auto-focus points which is more than its Canon competitors.The camera's overall button layout is pretty nice and since I've never used a Nikon before and haven't really gotten used to say the D3100 or D7000 layout, it makes me happy and I've gotten pretty good at pressing whats needed within a reasonable amount of time. Some people have griped about this, but coming from someone that hasn't owned a DSLR in years its quite decently laid out.When shooting video, there's nothing too fancy it basically lets you do whatever you can do when shooting stills. You get a wide range of resolutions and frame rates between 720P and 1080P from 24FPS to 30FPS. Its smooth and easy to do, and the capture limit is 20 minutes, and there's a tilt-shift effect which is really cool and I recommend everyone try it out.So far, the pop-up flash hasn't been used much by me but in the situations where its needed I've been pretty satisfied with the amount of light and lighting options. Futhermore, the battery life of the actual camera is halfway decent. I wouldn't say its fantastic, but I also wouldn't say it horrid. Its somewhere in the middle and if you do a lot of shooting you're going to need atleast one backup battery.The Kit lens definitely leaves more to be wanted, but it is a kit lens there really isn't much you can expect from it. My recommendation is to buy a 35mm or 50mm prime as well as a telephoto lens as well, those two lenses in combination with the kit lens are the perfect combination and will likely set you back about $500.The nice thing about this camera that I didn't realize is that it actually comes with the USB cable that you need to connect it to the computer which apparently the D3100 is missing(WTH?).

This camera is more advanced than Nikon's flagship professional model ten years ago.The D5100 has virtually every feature that today's enthusiast could hope for.  There are plenty of lists out there, and I won't repeat the myriad of features.One thing that I like in particular is the layout of the data on the LCD screen while shooting.

But canon has MUCH better video quality, Built-in focus motor, larger pentaprism viewfinder, dedicated ISO button and still I went with D5100 because of the image quality, lower noise at higher ISO, beautiful color depth, longer battery life, more focus points, decent video quality, side articulated screen & enough functions for a DSLR newbie with this price range.My complaint is the D5100 body is kinda cheap plastic feel and its little small to my hands so I am going to get a battery grip. And yes I hate to go around with D5100's menus for each and every setting but I paid less for D7000's sensor and a decent pack of features for one of the best mid-level DSLR's around.

It was challenging for decades using  SLR cameras because I had  to gaze down into a viewfinder with one eye. Focusing was difficult.  I've used Nikon Nikon D100 6MP Digital SLR Camera, Nikon D70S 6.1MP Digital SLR Camera, Fujis, Sonys, Panasonic, and others going back to the 1980's. Because of uncertainty of exposure caused by back lighting, I've made three sets of triple bracketed photos for each item.Recently some photos were needed using the copy stand where the camera  needed to be over 3 feet high above the table of the copy stand. I had reached my limit as I used a ladder to be able to gaze down on the subject. There had to be a better way. My Panasonic DMC-FZ150K 12.1 MP Digital Camera with CMOS Sensor and 24x Optical Zoom (Black) just does not cut it for back-lit photos, but it has an LCD screen which swivels out and I would not have to climb the ladder. But the FZ150 does not work well with back lighting.Then I saw the reviews here of the D5100.  It had the articulating LCD screen and was a Nikon SLR! But did it have bracketing of exposure?  It does! With such a screen maybe I would not have to use one eye looking down on a ladder. I could not order the D5100 fast enough. While waiting a day for my D5100 to arrive I watched  a video Blue Crane Digital zBC141 Introduction to the Nikon D5100 : Basic Controls several times to learn about the camera.Now for my experience with the D5100: It is much better than expected!  The spot focusing actually works, even with back lit objects. I never could auto focus before for these photos. The AF-S stock lens is constantly focusing in auto focus mode, so I don't have to press the shutter button half way every time I want to focus. That method did not work well for  macro close up shots with the older Nikons. With the D5100  use spot metering/focusing  option, and move the little box around the screen for the exact spot to focus on. The auto exposure  on aperture priority actually works too. I bracket anyway, but only have to take one set of 3 pictures for each item rather than three.The articulating screen is highly functional, and with the convenient position of the \"live view\" lever it's fast to go into that mode.  The AE+- functions works in live view, so I can adjust the exposure while seeing the results on the LCD screen instantly before the picture is taken.  The included 18-55mm lens does work for close-up work, and I can still use my old beloved Micro Nikor 60mm AF but without auto focus. Same with my Tamron 90mm f2.8 Macro, also without auto focus. The exposure functions work perfectly though. But it's just a matter of time  that I get more an AF-S micro lens such as Nikon 85mm f/3.5G AF-S DX ED VR Micro Nikkor Lens for Nikon Digital SLR Cameras for this camera.The battery life is so long I'm not using an AC adapter, which is a first for me.In summation, for production macro close up work using  a copy stand:Great swivel LCD screen with Live ViewAuto Exposure Control that works in difficult conditionsAuto Focusing on close up objects that works well in real time using spot focusingBattery life that goes on  and onConvenient buttonsReal time exposure control in LCD screenUltra sharp photosTakes old lenses (no auto-focus)Accurate white balance (after calibrating preset, see pdf manual)Brackets 3 photos quickly, no shutter lagProbably a great point and shoot too, but I prefer to not change all my macro settings for that such as white balance, bracketing, exposure, so I use my Panasonic DMC-FZ150K 12.1 MP Digital Camera with CMOS Sensor and 24x Optical Zoom (Black) with the Leica Lens for that...", "Date": "September 6, 2012"}, {"Title": "Best travel camera for me", "Author": "Beauregard", "ReviewID": "R33C3I9VP8N81Z", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I travel a lot and mostly use my camera for travel photography.

The padded Crumpler strap really helps, and I don't load up with any accessories (no extra lens, no flash, no extra battery, etc.).  The quality, range and lightweight of the kit zoom is really what clinches this for me.  The Fuji is amazing, but I find there are too many shots I miss because of the fixed lens.

As an amateur just beginning to get into photography for eventual professional use, this camera boasts everything I've ever wanted but never found in cheaper digital cameras targeted at the average consumer. Primarily: incredibly fast snapping speed (especially compared against those cheaper digital cameras I was talking about... which take forever for every picture :/), and an incredibly intuitive interface for configuring everything.I remember I had a real headache just trying to just change ISO settings on an old Canon PowerShot. I don't think I was even able to change shutter speed, much less manually focus the camera - but of course, all of these things that I've wanted to experiment with for years are now finally a snap with this camera. Consequently, every picture I take with this camera is eons ahead of anything any auto-focus camera I've used has ever been able to offer.On a related note, the fact that you also get a heads up within the viewfinder about shutter speed, etc. - is awesome!But if that's all I was looking for, I would've opted for a cheaper D3100. What really differentiated the D5100 was the additional abilitiy to capture full 1080p video. While I'm not aiming to create a film with this camera, I'd recently begun hunting for a cheap digital camcorder to use for motion capture for animation references. The fact that the D5100 was a step-up from the D3100 at the same cost of any decent camcorder sold me on the spot.On a sidenote: I am thoroughly satisfied with the lens the camera comes with, but I'm already beginning to see what other sorts of lenses I want to explore and use. I'm glad the price-point didn't hit the one-thousand-wall because now I have more money to put into lenses later down the line.Since I lack the experience to proffer a more technical review of the camera, let me make my concluding remarks: I am completely satisfied with my purchase and entry into the world of DSLRs. I don't see myself ever turning back, and I can foresee myself using this camera alone for at least several years. While the key distinguishing feature for the D5100 vs. the 3100 was the video capture (the MP increase isn't necessary for my needs), I doubt that's the case for everyone. If you're looking to purchase your first DSLR, not looking for video capture, and the increased megapixel count isn't necessary, I recommend you check out other reviews that make more point-by-point comparisons between the D5100 and D3100 to see if you might be able to save some money.

I would have rated it 4.5 but I couldn't give a half star.  The thing that drives me crazy is that in order to see a photo that I just shot - I need to have the flip screen open.  This annoys me because with the D90 - I just look down and see it.  The flip screen is taking some getting used to.  However, having a swivel LCD screen also has benefits.  I purchased the D5100 because it is rated very high when compared to the Nikon D7000.  I wanted the D7000 but it is currently more than I am willing to pay.  The D5100 gives me the higher megapixels, etc. that the D90 doesn't have and better and more user-friendly video recording (I don't use the video features often).  This will be my \"travel\" camera.  I am going to Bermuda in the spring and will be giving the D5100 a workout there.  I only used the kit lens a couple time.  I have placed my Sigma 18-200mm lens on this camera.

Mayes", "ReviewID": "R2MBI57YFCR82Y", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I bought this to replace my D40x after the flash quit working (though I still have it as a backup).  I had a few issues with the D40x, but I am extremely pleased with the D5100.  There are only a few minor complaints I have, which I will detail below.  I have only had it for about a week now but I think I made a great choice.  I would consider myself a moderately skilled amateur but have absolutely no desire for anything bigger and better!Pros:- The colors captured on this camera are leaps and bounds better than my D40x.  I put them on the same tripod and took the same picture using full auto mode.  Everything on my D40x had a reddish tint and the colors were not quite true.  The colors from the D5100 were simply stunning and were considerably more accurate.- There are 23 different levels of ISO sensitivity (my D40x had 6), and the pictures are considerably less noisy, even at higher ISOs.  I used the same lens/shutter speed/aperture/tripod for both cameras and shot each one at 200, 400, 800, 1600, and 3200 using my remote.  The picture from the D5100 seems less noisy at 3200 than what the D40x produced at 800.  Anything higher than 3200 seems to produce some fairly considerable noise however, especially if cropped.- Continuous mode is finally continuous!  Using the same SD card in both cameras (16GB class 10) I attempted continuous mode.  The D40x will take 3 frames per second, but only for the first second.  By then the buffer is full and the speed is drastically reduced.  The D5100 shoots 4 frames per second and takes at least 17 photos before any buffering is required.  In theory this means that you have 4 full seconds of shooting before any buffering occurs but I have never once filled the buffer (though I never tried to deliberately do so either).- I didn't purchase this with the intention of taking many videos, but after viewing a test video on my computer I was extremely pleased with the quality.  The video is very sharp and the file size is very reasonable (was about 30MB for a ~30 second clip...or roughly 1MB/second at 1920x1080 and 30FPS).  Note that the audio is monaural however.  If you want to use this for more professional videos then you'll probably need to purchase the external mic for stereo sound (which is quite expensive in my opinion).  This may eventually replace my dedicated video camera, though further testing and a telephoto lens will almost certainly be required.- Live mode finally works, if you prefer using that (note: live mode *must* be enabled to shoot video).- 11 auto focus points instead of only 3.  This is great if you're using a tripod and can't really recompose shots.Cons:- The biggest annoyance I have with this camera is that it does not show up as a USB drive when plugged into a computer.  It will still show up as an import source in some photography software (Aperture, iPhoto, etc.) though I have found the easiest thing to do is to insert the SD card into my SD to USB converter.  Using my converter it will show up just like a mass storage drive and I can browse the files and pull the pictures and movies directly.  Otherwise one must install Nikon's software just to import the files (which seems like a pain, plus I'll soon be running nothing but Linux which isn't supported).- Aperture 2.0 does not recognize the movies files so it cannot import them.  I don't have Aperture 3.0 so I can't speak for that, and I have no experience with Lightroom or Bibble 5.- Aperture 2.0 cannot read the new 14-bit RAW files that this camera generates (though it would read the 12-bit RAW files from my D40x).  I ultimately decided not to shoot in RAW anyway, but it's sort of a bummer that it doesn't support it as Aperture offers more editing options for RAW files.  Again, I cannot comment on how well any other software handles these files.Other thoughts:- I haven't had any issues with image sharpness.  Whether I use the 18-55mm VR lens or my 35mm f/1.8 lens (which I HIGHLY recommend), my pictures come out perfectly crisp and sharp.- It has not suddenly stopped taking pictures, though I did purchase an extended warranty (parts and labor) for it.  I now have 4 years of protection instead of just 1.- There is no auto-focus motor on the body of this camera so make sure to purchase a AF-I or AF-S lenses.  The older AF lenses will still work with this camera but you will have to manually focus every shot.- My 16GB card will hold roughly 1600 photos using JPEG (Fine) format.", "Date": "January 1, 2012"}, {"Title": "Excellent SLR with a couple minor quibbles", "Author": "P.

Is that a dead tree 75 feet away? Perfect! Some random dude in a crowd behind your family? Excellent! You can change this in most modes, but in auto the setting doesn't seem persistent? It's a function I need to play with more, but once you're aware of the camera's habit, it's easy to correct for.-Image stabilization in video mode. How did they justify cheaping out and not including this feature? The video quality is great, but lack of stabilization really hurts. Also, you tend to cover the microphone with your camera strap if you're not careful, adding some noise. Use a tripod, brace yourself, do something, otherwise you'll shoot some really shaky video.-Buy a screen protector. I scratched mine within a week of having the camera.

Makes me look like a professional photographer.", "Author": "alp249", "ReviewID": "R1YQ9L35W3YUSP", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I bought this camera to use in a professional capacity. I do marketing and communications for an NGO in Haiti and I've also done some work for an NGO in Afghanistan. I use it to capture photos and video to use in a marketing materials and communications for these organizations. Before I got the Nikon I was using a Canon Rebel XS 10.1 MP SLR and a separate Sony video camera. It was completely cumbersome and inefficient -- I wasn't working to my full potential in either photography or videography because of it. And although I was initially skeptical of a photo/video combination SLR, the sheer convenience of the idea won me over.Let me stress that although I purchased this camera to use in a professional capacity I am not a professional photographer (whatever that means these days). But I swear with this camera I could be a staff photographer on National Geographic. I've photographed and shot some really interesting environments under harsh conditions and this camera turned everything into pure magic. The video quality is even better than what I got with a standalone video camera. You get stunning photographs and crystal clear video with bright, vivid colors at the push of a button.And although I can't say enough good things about this camera, I do want to point out a few tips that potential buyers should be aware of:1. The battery life on the video is really, really short. I had a backup battery that I kept in my bag fully charged and there were many days where I went through two batteries in the first half of the day. I eventually learned to manage my time a bit better and only film when I really thought it was needed, but I prefer not to have to work like that -- you never know what you might need later on. So I would highly suggest buying at bare minimum one extra battery if you plan to use this for anything more extensive that facebook video uploads.2. Watch out for the auto focus on video mode. I wouldn't exactly say it's auto focus because on quite a few occasions the camera failed to auto focus or auto focused on the completely wrong thing in video mode. By the end of my first 3-week trip with this camera, I had learned the tricks to it: Like switch to photo mode on auto focus then back to video mode if you want to be sure it's focused, or just use manual focus if you know you'll be shooting a more or less fixed object. This was by far my biggest gripe with this camera.3. The built-in mic is surprisingly good -- although I could see it being a problem for people who are picky about their sound. I was on the move all the time working in an austere environment, so I didn't want to bother with an external mic and the built-in sufficed. And I didn't feel like dropping another $200 on an external mic. But I may make this investment in the future.4. It gets heavy. That's not to say this isn't a light, compact camera for what it does -- it definitely is. But I'm petite and found it a bit of an awkward challenge to hold this camera in the right position when shooting. Why didn't I use a tripod? Again, because I was on the move so much, shooting things that were happening in a chaotic environment. With a video camera, this wouldn't have been a problem -- I would have either been shooting off the shoulder or using a handycam. But with this you've got to hold it out. And it definitely gets tiring.5. Don't forget to buy a gigantic, high-speed memory card for the video.6. I initially bought a gray market version of this camera online. I had no idea what that meant until my friendly neighborhood camera shop owner told me what it meant. I ended up returning it and re-buying it, basically at full retail, at a camera shop. Was this necessary? Probably not. I could have saved myself the $100. But, like I said, I in and around some pretty harsh and unpredictable environments and the camera can take a beating. I wanted the peace of mind of knowing that if something happened, I could bring it back to the U.S. and get it fixed without any problems. I would encourage any buyer to do their research on this issue before making a purchase from any seller. I'm not accustomed to dropping $1,000 bucks on one item so I wanted to be really careful.But anyway I am completely enamored with this camera.

Rosenbaum \"133t medical student\"", "ReviewID": "R3G1AN316ZCWWU", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Let's be honest...you want a camera that responds to you and captures the pixels the first time around.  As long as you get those pixels, you can get the image you want out of the digital negative.There are few things you get better with more expensive models, including more rapid focus and metering...and if you're in that kind of situation, far be it from me to criticize, you're making use of that kind of equipment.But this is a really good camera.  Even factory refurbished, it's a great piece of hardware (though a refurb is better for the entry-level hobbyist).  First of all, it shoots in a raw format (for the noobs, that means whatever the sensor sees, it stores...no compression or loss).  Nikon produces very consistent optics, so I'd recommend getting Photoshop or at least Photoshop elements (or any Adobe product which gives you Bridge and Adobe Camera Raw) so you can apply the optical compensation.I sold my video camera to buy this model because it handles video in hi-def for casual shooting.  You'll need to shoot in ten minutes at a time (that's how the file system works) or plug into a computer for long-duration capture, but you will get what you want.This is also a model with a long history, and replacement parts are still easy to find, so repairs are not impossible.  I'm a DIY guy with the right tools and measuring devices, so when my warranty runs out, I can fix this.If you're a noob looking for a starter camera, or a pro looking for a camera that you can take into hazardous conditions (there are off-the-shelf diving shells for this sucker) then this is a great piece of hardware.  It's on par with the Canon Eos Rebel T3i...but costs less.One quirk...it knows more about the optics than you do, but has a hard time giving you information.  Sometimes it'll cycle past sharp focus if you're too close to an object for your lens.  It's a conflict in the software.  Just back up, adjust the zoom in a bit, and try again.", "Date": "January 15, 2014"}, {"Title": "Great camera.

Side by side photos on the screen look the same (d50 is 6.0 megapixel). Printed there is probably a difference. However, this camera is much faster in burst mode and also shoots video, which is why I got it. What I miss is the internal motor for AF on older lenses, but I can handle focusing manually. Non AF-S lenses are (mostly) still compatible, which is why I like Nikon. I don't have any complaints, it just wasn't the step up from the D50 that I had imagined. Video quality is OK, I wish I could get 60 FPS on the highest resolution. I've had it for nearly two years and it still functions perfectly and I have even dropped it once (the lens also still functions perfectly but the plastic casing didn't survive.) Recommended if you want a good camera that gives you a great auto mode and also full manual controls, but to be honest, the smaller camera systems are starting to go down in price and the size of those is very attractive, and the sensor is the same size, such as the samsung nx300.

I loved my D90 and used it more than my D300, which I now only use for studio work, or when I might get banged-up in the field.  The D7000 performs better than the D300 and it's lighter.  The D5100 is still close, but with such limited options, it just isn't as versatile or adaptable as the others.I got a tongue-lashing for caring about a depth of field button, but professionals use selective focus a lot!  The focus array on the D5100 seems adequate, but I found two situations today where the D7000 did a better job.  I'm going to take both bodies out to shoot aspen and the rut tomorrow.  We'll see how they do in a real work situation.  I'll probably use the D5100 for wide angle and macro shots.  I'll use the D7000 for big, fast lenses that might be too much for a plastic body.I haven't tried movie mode or some of the other features of either camera.  The \"special effects\" menu looks like toyland, and I doubt anyone serious about photography would use them.This is a decent camera.  I like its size, but not its handling, even with a vertical grip.  The \"Live View\" is not particularly impressive, especially outdoors in the sun.  The 16 MP feature is overkill in most situations.  After 10MP, more is not necessarily better...unless you have very special purposes.  We just tend to be memory gluttons on electronics in general.  I have a 65\" TV and past 1900 or maybe, 2400 pixels, it's overkill.  When was the last time you printed a 30'X40\" print?In the end, it is what it is...A nice, simple camera that takes decent photos without a lot of hassle.", "Date": "September 15, 2011"}, {"Title": "Got a Lemon!", "Author": "A.

It is simple to use, takes really good pictures, and is particularly good in low-light situations where using a flash is not possible. One of the menu selections on the main menu dial allows turning off the flash and keeping all of the other features and settings intact, and this is very useful in taking pictures where there is reasonable light, but use of a flash is inappropriate.I bought the body only, so I cannot address the supplied kit lenses. I am using the kit lens from my old Nikon D70 (18-70mm)and a Nikon AF-S Nikkor 55-300mm with the body. Both give very sharp images.The camera offers a variety of shooting options, though for most uses the auto-focus, auto-iris is quite adequate, and is the one I generally use. For the more ambitious photographer it will take either raw or .jpeg images, and it allows selecting image quality. It stores images on a SD card, and with a large card one can save hundreds of pictures before downloading. The battery also holds up for extended shooting.As a camera, it is easily a five star. The reason I lowered the rating is because the grip is a bit small, and the shutter release button is under a projection that makes holding the camera for any period of time uncomfortable for a person with large hands. This camera is a replacement for a Nikon D70, which had a larger hand grip and was more comfortable to hold. This design issue is my only complaint about this very nice camera, and would not be an issue for someone with smaller hands. I have a video camera, so do not use this for videos, though that is one of the features it offers.

Results: the old prime lenses gave the sharpest results as usual but none of the Nikon lenses I tested came even close to matching the ultra high resolution I got from the Canon Rebel T3i with the included kit lens. Other than the softness, this is a great camera for low light situations.I don't know why this camera is softer than the Canon but I am not the only one experiencing this issue, you may compare both cameras using the \"Comparometer\" online which clearly confirms my findings. I am guessing the T3i Rebel has a better sensor than the Nikon and that is a real pity because I would have preferred to use Nikon. The good news is that the D5100 performs far better than the Canon in low light conditions.By the way, the 1080p video test I shot was unusable, the D5100 does not have anything close to the kind of optical stabilization required for video production and I am not going to carry a tripod when I can use my Canon HV20 camcorder instead without any trouble, it just would not be practical.Despite all these shortcomings, I still would recommend the D5100 for telephoto and low-light still photos (such as wedding photography).Update: After further research it turns out that all Nikon DLSRs in this price range are famous for producing soft images which require sharpening in post. Indeed, I looked at my D60 photos and they are also soft. However, there are rumors that Nikon has plans to switch to a different type of sensor to keep up with the competition. So, maybe before 2012 Nikon will bring good news for all Nikon fans, that is, if the world does not end in 2012.", "Date": "June 7, 2011"}, {"Title": "Nice at first glance, but a lot of defects below the surface.", "Author": "Selcuk Onat", "ReviewID": "R18RBF3Y01BX2X", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "First off let me say that if you criticize a camera on these boards you will be personally attacked by an army of jerks, so its not that easy. Just take that into account when you read glowing positive reviews. Noone's paying me to speak truth about a camera.I tested a 5100 and was not that thrilled by the camera. In fact, I returned it making sure not to get stuck with it.The shutter is quiet and fast, and the menu is well designed, but the buttons are arranged in a unique fashion that someone else mentioned is different from most other Nikon dSLRS, so using it and another would not be a seamless experience. The live-view screen is almost more trouble than its worth, but it's mandatory on an HD vidcam. Dealing with it, however, can be a hassle for stills, since you're inclined to turn it face in, and then you have to turn it back every time you monitor etc.The LCD is very large and pretty, but it's also quite vulnerable if you're involved in any sort of action or even travel. You have to watch the screen like a hawk. If you're shooting concerts or street where you raise your hands above the crowd, great, but is that worth the trouble the rest of the time? Maybe so, it does provide for different shooting styles, and getting low is great, too. For video, the screen is mandatory, but back later on the video...Finally, is there a reason the camera can't come with a screen protector? You have to buy one as an accessory, and Nikon's brand name ones are no longer made. So now I have to waste time tracking down a kludge solution which may damage the screen. You pay $700 for a camera and they can't include such a critical item that's hard to find that costs 2 bucks to make? Thanks Nikon.Beyond the great value for price, I find the default saturation setting to be really flat, so while VIVID is too much on other cameras, I find it mandatory on this one, which is odd. The shots do look great at that point. The focussing doesn't seem to be what it claims. It's good for moving objects, but average at range-finding up close, at least on my 18-135 DX lens. It doesn't hang, but it doesn't seem particularly accurate either. There's a limit to how many shots I can shoot testing, and my lenses are decent, but not top of the line, but the sharpness is not really there consistently. I've been attacked on this point. Let me just say that this camera focusses noticeably worse than the D40x. I dont care if people say its the same design. Its a much worse, less robust performer in the focussing dept, despite having more points.The 16MP doesn't seem like much if any improvement over my D40X.  Let the scoffing begin, but the JPEG processing on this one resultsin about the same quality in my ultra close-up comparisons. There is more data, (fewer shots per card), but the final is about 20% better. Besides, 10-16 would be 1.6 times better. I would say 1.3 times better, and still not sure. Fine lines are blurring more at the point of pixelization.With a few days spent on the video, I have to say it's pretty weak. The AF struggles, suffers even. You feel bad for your lenses being overworked.  I know this is as advertised, but the video AF is definitely below camcorder quality, although not any worse than my Canon Vixia in low light, which is really terrible. At least dSLR lenses can be manually focussed easily depending on the lens. Nevertheless, this is no point and forget vidcam, and my Vixia beats it hands down in daylight and overcast.What's even worse is that no matter what you set before you launch into video, it chooses the ISO for you. You can choose aperture, and you can make the camera stop adjusting exposure by locking AE, but you cannot make it stay in a low ISO in low light, and its low light video is too grainy to be used outside of personal footage.  It looks great on the LCD, and on Youtube videos, but full screen, it looks much worse. I have yet to make this camera shoot low light in a low ISO, which does not show up in EXIF data like stills.  The video stays the same quality no matter what kludge you try, and there are many out there, but people keep realizing that their video ends up the same no matter what.It is NOT a low-light miracle worker in video period.  Shooting video also mandates that you use battery-sucking Live-view, which stays ON until you stop) In room light or daylight, it does much better, but you still can't control the ISO.  Plus if you really like shooting video, you will need the $120 in AC adapters or several batteries, because I would say the battery does about 20 minutes in video. Honestly, it even looks small, although it does charge fast, in about 60-70 minutes, which is about 1/3 faster than my EL-9.This camera is a perfectly portable size, but otherwise a major disappointments. The D5100 is sold for a fair price but promises too much.  I wanted to make the video work somehow, and workarounds are fine, and it does shoot good daylight video, but a camera that takes my settings and then ignores them while pretending it's displaying them is just going to aggravate long term.  It is not the low light miracle worker its been sold as. Even stills are about a two-step improvement. I shot 1600 ISO tonight on my D40x and it looks about the same as 6400 in the D5100. That said, there's an unpleasant aspect to the 5100's grain when it shows up. It's too distinct from the background. It stands out. As I said, this sensor also has saturation and dynamic range issues.Just thinking about how this camera is marketed as the can-do even though it's sold to a clearly consumer market bugs me. I think most amateurs won't find these problems until spending a few months with the camera, and I find the entire process dishonest. Then again, it does a lot for the price by past standards. Just don't be fooled into thinking that workarounds will make this useful to a budding videographer for instance, let alone any type of semi-pro.

The 18-55mm lens that comes with it is sharper than the 18-70mm and 18-200mm.  Pictures are usable up to 1600 ISO.  The controls are fairly decent though in some modes not all options are available, such as shooting in HDR requires you to choose certain configurations that I can't even remember what they are.  I tried looking up on google to see why HDR was greyed out but their suggestions didn't help.  Not that I care about HDR that much but it's frustrating when you can't choose it when you need it.  The white balance is another issue.  You cannot always choose customized white balance.  Again it depends on the settings you choose and this too is something I have no idea what settings would make it work.  I never had this problem with Canon DSLR's.  I'll say that for everything else the D5100 is miles beyond anything Canon has in the same price range.  In fact this camera is superior to the D90 that I used to covet so much.  This model is the real sweet spot between all of the models from D3000-D5300.  I mean 16mp is enough of a hassle without going to 24mp.  This megapixel race is ridiculous.  If only there were options for 6-8mp NEFs.  This is a superior camera than the two successors and can be had very inexpensive.  If you need a longer lens I'd suggest the 18-105mm instead of buying the 55-200mm as an add on.  Even with the 18-55mm you can simply crop to zoom in as it'll be as sharp as anything.  If all you care about is image quality choose your DSLR in this order: D5100, D3000, D3100, and ignore the rest.", "Date": "December 18, 2013"}, {"Title": "its ok for the price, weight and size but frustrating over time", "Author": "Michael Daniec \"stop torture\"", "ReviewID": "R1LCTQ378QECB6", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "Loved the size and light weight but the autofocus became a huge issue for me over time.

The quality of the pictures was okay but I finally realized this camera is just underpowered for my needs (can't really think anybody but total amateur could be happy with it). The live shooting mode is next to useless because of how long it takes to focus and how unreliable the focus is int this mode (this is still a huge issue for most DSLRs). Was happy to advance to a D600, although even this camera could use the more advanced autofocus of the D800 ie 51 points instead of the 39 points it has (silly of Nikon to have purposefully undermined its functionality that way).

I recently took it to Hawaii on vacation and captured some amazing shots and video.Before purchasing, I compared it with the Canon T3i and T3i and the Nikon D3100.  The Canon cameras felt plasticy and cheap and the D5100 had the processor and sensor of the higher-end premium Nikon cameras (the D7000 and D90).I like the video capabilities, though they are not what I use it for primarily.The time lapse feature is well done and easy to use.The only complaint that I have is the (minor) noise generated by the (continual) auto-focus motor during video capture.  That can be a pain.  However, if you set it to manual focus mode, there is no problem.When you purchase this camera, be sure to get a good tripod, polarizing filter, UV filter, backup battery, and extra storage card.", "Date": "December 10, 2011"}, {"Title": "Great", "Author": "SebastianColombia", "ReviewID": "R5BQFQQUJZM49", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Awesome color. lots of in camera option and a couple of clever tricks. good low light performance. really good metering.

OPERATOR ERROR!!The best way to describe this camera is to compare it to a car.  You had and older car it had the normal stuff a/c heat,radio.  The new ones have buttons to adjust the seat mirrors, temp for one or more drivers.  This camera is the same idea..there are many things the camera can do and will do for you that were not available on older cameras.  Just like the newer car with all the special features and gadgets.You have to use/play with them to truly understand how they work.  There are many \"auto\" settings where the camera does the work for you, but you can also choose to take some pictures the way you want to.I bought this camera because I wanted to get a picture of my grandson performing at Radio City.  His school chorale was pefroming as a \"warm-up\" for the Rocketts. I wanted get at least one picture of he and his partner dancing.Yes I was able to get a fantastic picture under much less than desiredable conditions.  As I stated at the top of the update.  This camera is worth every cent.I wanted to get pictures of him while they were doing a dance routine.  The conditions for being able to get the idea place for taking picures of them was not the best.  Pople were still coming into and getting their seats at the start of their performance23 September 2011.I will be adding to this review in the future.For the best review that I have seen personally (this review was the one that put me over the edge to buy this camera) go to the review that was written by Alan Montgomery on August 17th.My review will be slanted toward a \"senior\" age level as that is where I am.I have had some experience with SLR as I have a Pentax K1000 35mm film camera.It has taken many great pictures but I felt it was time to move up to digital.  In 2007 I bought a Sony DSC-H5, basically for a vacation in Hawaii.  It is basically a point and shoot with a great telephoto lens. But being a point and shoot it was somewhat limited, which I did not have a problem with at that time.That is why I now have the D5100, as with grand children, getting involved in difference activities I found myself needing a camera that was capable of taking pictures in low light situations, which the Sony was not that good at handling.For me personally the learning curve on this camera is somewhat intimidating.  Again the best way to learn is the old \"hands on\".  The documentaion that came with this package is very informative and definitely gets you headed in the right direction.I will be in Disney World for a week in October and will up date when I have time upon return.", "Date": "September 23, 2011"}, {"Title": "Nikon's Abysmal QC", "Author": "TAZ_SHOOT", "ReviewID": "R1KKPXXG91X7LV", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "So here are the two shots that I used to test the D5100s:1) One shot, 30 sec long w/ cap on to find hot pixels.2) One shot, 2.5sec, f/36, 200mm, out of focus, laptop screen as target (Empty Word Document). Shot auto-toned in Photoshop to see dead pixels and dust.The units tested and results:1) From a well known brick store that turned into online store (refurbished kit D5100 and 18~55mm): Dust spots + hot pixels on sensor.2) From a well known and very respected brick store's website (new kit D5100 and 18~55mm): Dust spots + hot pixels on sensor.3) Replacement from above store's website (new kit D5100 and 18~55mm): Dust spots on sensor + hot pixels on sensor.4) Local mom-and-pop, very respected store, tested by their tech.

(Serial 32555806)9) Exchange from chain checked in store (new kit D5100 and 18~55mm): hot pixel on sensor visible on LCD (w/ cap on). (Serial 3253032)10) Exchange from chain checked in store (new kit D5100 and 18~55mm): hot pixel on sensor visible on LCD (w/ cap on). (Serial 3251783)11) One more unit from brick store of (1) that I showed to the salesperson (new kit D5100 and 18~55mm): hot pixel on sensor visible on LCD (w/ cap on). (Serial 327xxxx)12) Instant exchange of the one in (11) (new kit D5100 and 18~55mm): Dust spots on sensor + no hot pixels on sensor visible on LCD (w/ cap on). (Serial 328xxxx)All units had shutter-counts below 20 when I got them, all except one (the body only in '4') used the lenses that came in the kit and none showed improvement by using built-in sensor dust cleaner and the \"Rocket Blower\". Total indoor envirnoment for the first two shots was less than 20 seconds taken in connecting the body to the lens (camera body pointing down and lens back pointing up).Should I say more, are they moving these cameras without QC at all. Even if I discount for dust itself, I mean how much time does it realistically take to do a pixel remap for dead/hot pixels at QC when the item will take more time, effort, money and reputation later. If these are \"test escapes\" then that means that these units went out without \"burn-in\" which means that more dead/hot pixels will show up as the unit ages.This dust could actually be oil splatters (like in D7000 issues) and perhaps that is why it does not respond to built in dust-cleaner and \"rocket blower\"... Either way Nikon should do something about their QC on this model...-P.S.-I tested the unit in (12) for hot pixels at ISO 100/2000/6000 and found 3 hot pixels in 6000, 1 in 2000 (not the saem as in 6000) and none in 100. This is the best unit thus far so I took it to shop mentioned in (4) for cleaning and for $35 they removed 6 out of the 8 stuborn (which do not respond to \"rocket blower\") dust spots. I think I will call it a day here and keep this unit hoping that it does not \"grow\" any dead pixels.I called Nikon and found them to be polite but un-appologetic about the whole issue. They offered free shipping on a D5100 from their website and retro-actively pay for return if the unit was found w/ dead/hot pixels or dust on sensor. Good call but I decided to go with a local shop to ensure quick turn around, especially if its the exact same price (price + tax + no shipping).I am holding my 1/5 stars because 1/12 is not the best score for a new product...", "Date": "February 16, 2012"}, {"Title": "D5100 Nikon", "Author": "kevin oconnell", "ReviewID": "R1DUMLYPN1KSLV", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "Not very user friendly , took a little use to get familiar with functions and very easy to inadvertently delete pictures.

I got the D5100 expecting a decent upgrade. Unfortunately I was kind of disappointed when comparing it with my D5000. The D5100 feels more amateur than the D5000 does. It is smaller (almost too small) and difficult to grab if you have a 18-200 as I do. In addition, the d5100 does not offer the possibility to customize the lcd display (for manual and auto modes) as the D5000 does, this bugged me because that is an easy way to notice in which mode I am shooting. Another downgrade of the D5100 is the lack of the grid in the viewfinder. The viewfinder seems oriented to those who have a point and shot and want to upgrade. It is clear that Nikon here is aiming to those who shoot using the lcd display and not to those using the viewfinder. That, for me, is a big loss compared with my D5000, I do a lot of architecture photography and the grid is very helpful; it also helps me to keep the horizon when shooting landscapes, the lake or the ocean.I returned the D5100 after comparing it hand to hand with the D5000. Not enough of an upgrade for me and not worth the expense. The D5100 is cute, small and might work well for those who want to try a dslr for the very first time.

I attempted some phone troubleshooting and it looks like the shutter was working fine, but the image sensor was completely blown.  This camera was securely packed, not jostled, not mistreated at all - it's just a failure.  While troubleshooting I searched the Internet and found that this happens a LOT.  Either the shutter or the image sensor fails and the only option is to send the camera in for repairs that last for weeks:  not really an option when you're camping across the country.  Nikon states that they are \"not responsible for lost photo ops\" but they really should be responsible for product quality, and they should replace every defective unit by overnight mail if need be.

On this particular model many D5100 customers are having the same issues with shutter mechanisms.  Nikon should definitely re-evaluate their design/manufacturing methods.  I have been a loyal Nikon customer for the last 35 years, still own many Nikon cameras and lenses.  But loyalty is quite perishable when design(or manufacturing)-flaw-fix-costs are stuck back onto the customer.  Nikon should think about lifelong warranty including the mechanical parts inside the camera unless there is evidence that the camera is dropped, tempered with etc.  Since the shutter issue it is not covered under warranty, Nikon is asking over $150 to fix the shutter mechanism.", "Date": "July 20, 2012"}, {"Title": "Nice but for whom?", "Author": "Zan \"Zan\"", "ReviewID": "R3MFW0G5WCVD75", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "In terms of sensor and picture quality, I have nothing to complain. An excellent camera from that point of view. As people have spoken enough about the good side, I would like to mention some thing that I do not like.Following the market trend, the D5100 is trying to load a lot of things into the camera. The manufacturer is focusing too much on marketing strategies and forgot that simplicity is also important and welcome. A classic example: the aperture priority and speed priority. These are actually the same thing, and one of them is redundant. But now even more unnecessary options are packed into a small machine and only few of them are truly needed. The pixel size racing is also becoming ridiculous. For that type of camera, 10MP is good enough. More is not positive anymore. If people do want to make huge prints, they should go with full-frame or medium format cameras. Many of the in-camera photo treatment options are also unnecessary or even childish. Serious photo editing should be taken care of by computer software as the small camera screen will make the job rough anyway. I wish more efforts are made for dynamic range improvement (D5100 did well in this aspect) and cost reduction (this can be improved). It does not make much sense to spend $900 (current street price) for something plastic that will become obsolete in 2 to 3 years.The D5100 is supposed to be a premier entry level camera. \"Premier entry level\" is actually a bad idea (it is almost an oxymoron in reality). For those who do not know how to take good pictures, the extra cost will not help them improve picture quality much, as they may not even fully utilize the capacity of the lower entry level cameras while they are less expensive. For those who are serious about photography, a lot of features are either trivial (e.g., scene selection, live view, in-camera editing, etc.), or not good enough (e.g., movie). If they are serious, even if they are not good now, they will be determined to learn how to manipulate exposures instead of relying on things like scene selections. For some people, the D5100 offers high ISO for dark objects, but it will be wiser to spend the extra money on a good lens, e.g., the 50mm/f1.8D, 50mm/f1.8G, or 35mm/f1.8G. These fast lens will help in low lighting situations and produce better pictures, and they will not become obsolete in 20 years. In addition, filters also help in many ways to expand the capabilities of the camera. In my opinion, the D5100 should be modified in one of the following two directions:1. For those who are serious about photography and do not have the budget for D7000, the D5100 could offer them a less expensive model with same sensor quality but even lower price (by minimizing the unimportant features), or the current price but more functions/features for professionals instead of those for populace.2. For those who do not intend to learn photography, the D3100 is good enough as it also has the live view, video option, and improved high ISO. They do not need the D5100 (except they have no other place to spend the additional $200). If they do need an upgrade, then auto HDR and high resolution screen in D5100 can be good additions, but these should be enough. The price difference could be within $50-100, not $200 (by dropping other \"improvements\").Here comes a question of how to segment customers. The current popular categories of 'beginners' and 'enthusiasts\" are misleading. A more useful segmentation should be enthusiasts or not, i.e., those who want to learn photography and those who do not, and all the features and functions should be designed and packaged in these two directions. But today, things are mixed in one direction (for entry level cameras), the distinctions are mostly a matter of degrees, i.e., more or less features, not different types of features.By the way, I also would like to talk about the appearance design. The D5100 is elegant, but not as good as D40 and D3000 (in appearance). Nikon made one of the D5100 body's corners round (lower-right side viewing from front). That part does not match the the overall sleek looking. The childish treatment makes that part look silly and the entire body fatty. Another design issue: Viewing from the right side, the gap between the display panel and the camera body is unnecessarily too wide. I think a tight fit will make it look more robust and elegant. Forgive me for being fastidious, but appearance is as important to me as functions and quality. And appearance promotes sale (think about Apple's gracious designs).Overall, the D5100 is a good camera, but it is not the best in combination of features and price: both enthusiast and non-enthusiasts will pay for many features they do not need, in different ways. The problem is camera manufacturers are trying to blend different needs instead of separating them in the entry level DSLR section.", "Date": "July 8, 2011"}, {"Title": "Viewfinder issue", "Author": "Nancy H", "ReviewID": "RBKQI70WO6XY9", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "Camera would be fine.

Now all of my \"AF\" lenses are \"MF\". Shame on me for buying it, but the next body up with modern features and the AF servo is $550 more and I don't know that Nikon will keep the AF servo in for the next generation.

This means my hand wraps around too far and it is hard to hold on to the camera. The body is also not as tall as it used to be, again making it hard to grip. I have larger than average hands, but the D50's grip is why I went Nikon over Canon 6 years ago.3. Lack of mini-lcd on the top.

I've used the D40, D40X, D5000 and naturally thought that the D5100 was a fabulous upgrade.  Never really wanted Canon cause I hate change! But I did check the comparisons.  The colors are awesome but guess what, the camera has some serious flaws.It almost never focuses on the subject choosing the focus on the background unless you use it in manual mode. It takes a long time to focus since the autofocus keeps searching, at times the shutter will not work.  Other times, the camera won't focus, PERIOD! If you use it now and then as a hobby you wont notice it.  But if you're shooting continuous, then you're in for some serious problems...More than half the images are ruined if so little.I am extremely upset and now have to send the camera for Nikon to 'repair\" depending on their 'assessment'.

I paid so much for this camera and now it has to be repaired if Nikon decides its covered by the warranty????

Apparently the D7000 has it according to my research.  Check youtube and other forums.  Youtube actually shows how to fix the backfocusing but I am not going to interfere with the camera.  DO NOT BE FOOLED WITH THE $200 off.  THE REASON IS BECAUSE THE AUTOFOCUS SYTEM IS FLAWED!!!  It is not just me because my friend and I bought the same camera and her autofocus system gives problem also.  She also gets BLACK IMAGES from a defective shutter.  Check Amazon reviews before buying!  So its not just a flawed one in the batch. Now I'm stuck with Nikon accessories such as lens, flash...Will add more when I send the camera to Nikon to repair since customer service seemed to be good so far.A few people wanted to upgrade to this model but I actually showed them the flaws.  And some wanted the D7000.  But when I told them about the problems...But get this, my friend who wanted to upgrade from his D3100, his camera is flawless.  I would have thought the more expensive camera would have been better but apparently not.UPDATE:  The camera and the lens was sent to Nikon for they to figure out what the problems was.  According to Nikon status its a B1 repair.  They said they've adjusted the autofocus system and I am crossing my fingers that it has been repaired.  If not I'm sending it right back and making some noise.  Some people stated the backfocusing issue they had was never resolved or if it was took more than one repair.

I will start by saying I love my Nikon D80, but I will never claim it is nearly as sharp as Canon.  My husband has a Canon xsi and T2i and my daughter has the T2i.  All 3 are stellar cameras and the sharpness would be hard to beat.  I prefer the color balance in the Nikon, and had hoped to improve the sharpness issues with this camera and the 18-200 VR lens.  Didn't happen.  So here is my opinion.PROS:*  Does great at high ISO.  Took photos at 1600 with no visible noise.*  Video feature.CONS:*  I personally found the LV button to be an annoying placement which was easy to hit inadvertently.  A button on the back would have been preferred.*  The sharpness just wasn't much of an improvement to justify the hefty price for the combo.*  I love the moveable focus box in the D80 viewfinder.  I do NOT like red focus lights.  They do not show well against some backgrounds or in high light.  I found no option to these.*  The camera uses a non-standard USB connector which means if you have multiple cameras, you will need to use separate cords for this one.Bottom line:  If you want super sharp photos, buy a Canon.  If you want to upgrade your Nikon for video and low-light situations, this may work for you.

Nevertheless, this is an honest review from a \"vacation/street photographer, as I believe most of you are. Here is the explanation:For more than three years I have been using a refurbished Sony W-150 that I broke the very same day I received it from Amazon. You can find the story in my review of that purchase. However, I am an avid reader of users reviews here, and I enjoy taking casual photos, as well. On May 22, this year (2012) I saw this Nikon camera on sale at my Costco store as part of a kit including a bag and two lens (a 18-55 mm and a 55-300mm) and few more smaller stuff. The total price, tax included, was a little above $1000. I rushed home, searched the internet for prices and reviews and decided that it was my opportunity to buy a \"real\" camera. So I did. I took a few casual pictures, they came out good, but I did not see much of a difference from the ones I took with the old point and shoot. I little frustrated I decide to take some pictures side by side, with the two cameras. Well, in all my attempts the pictures, for regular printing, did not show much of a difference and in some cases the point and shoot even gave better results. I don't want to be hated by the hordes of this camera devotees, so I will refrain from saying much more. I will limit myself to add a few of the pictures I took so you can judge by yourself. You may be able to download and see them with your viewer software and see the parameters (F number, ISO, shutter speed).I want to tell in advance that I did not take any \"specially difficult conditions\" photo. I am sure that in special situations like sports with fast action or low light the Nikon would crush the Sony. However, those special conditions are not were I take the vast majority of my pictures. I take pictures when I go out with friends, parties or any interesting thing I see on the street. I take more time enjoying the events than trying to make an \"astonishing photo\". For that purpose, I did not see any clear advantage between the old point and shoot and this semi-pro camera. Considering the load I had to carry - bag, camera, two lenses and more, in addition to the $1K + price I paid, it definitely made me feel unhappy with my purchase. I don't have the opportunity to test other SLR cameras in the same league, like the Canon 3ti or the Sony Alpha. However, unless they are really much better than this Nikon, for the regular/casual use, they will give similar results.Therefore, if you are just a casual photographer, do yourself a favor, buy a more modern point and shoot that will cost you a few hundred bucks and you can easily carry with you everywhere. No matter what people say, my reason is in the pictures. I attached some of them to this review. I have seen the wonderful photos posted by others in this camera review. The vast majority were worked with photo shop or are not what regular vacationers would take. My photos were takes in JPG mode, direct out of the camera.Finally, please understand I am not so dumb to directly compare an expensive, modern SLR with an old point and shoot. All I am saying is that it does not bring any noticeable advantage to the casual photographer. My pictures prove that. I will some taken outside soon. Now, if what you want is to enter a photo contest, the D5100 and the others in its league is the way to go.", "Date": "August 26, 2012"}, {"Title": "Bad video quality", "Author": "Disappointed20", "ReviewID": "R3B260P3CTXBWA", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "Thought, the picture quality is good and it is a fast camera the video quality is very poor.

Yellin \"dinosaurus13\"", "ReviewID": "R23RI7669H2PM7", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I bought a Nikon D5100 with these TWO \"kit\" lenses: 18-55 and 55-200mm. As background, I have 45 years \"serious amateur\" experience in photography, but little in digital photography. My first \"serious\" digital SLR was a SONY A100 that I bought so I could use my Minolta AF lenses. At this time, I wanted to update my camera because technology had advanced so much! It was a major decision to change camera brands because of my investment over the years in Minolta AF mount lenses. BUT, I wanted something lighter than the SONY \"professional\" cameras, and something with a better imaging reputation.I shot approximately 90 test images with each of the lenses. After carefully reviewing them at 100% magnification in Photoshop, I can honestly say that only 1 of the 180 photos was genuinely sharp.The 55-200 had trouble focusing under certain circumstances even in mid-day on a mostly cloudy but well lighted day. In addition to the lack of sharpness either the lenses, the sensor or the in camera software did a poor job with contrast and color rendition. Neither zoom ring moved \"smoothly.\" Both felt \"rough.\" I understand that they are relatively cheap \"kit\" lenses, but I expect much better from a lens with the Nikkor name!The mirror in the SLR body did something indicative of poor design, poor quality and/or poor manufacturing. It shifted at the last moment as it seated itself. It was not aligned properly for its travel and seating.There is something about the design of the D5100 body front where it is supposed to fit your right hand that was VERY uncomfortable for me. This could be a personal issue since hand sizes vary.Fortunately, I was able to return the camera for a full refund!Overall, I was EXTREMELY disappointed! I expected MUCH better from Nikon. I then bought a Canon T3i with 18-55 and 55-250mm \"kit\" lenses, which is roughly equivalent to the Nikon D5100 package but $100 more. I had read MANY reviews, both professional and user. They almost unanimously favored the Nikon which is why I first tried the Nikon. I have now had the Canon for about two weeks and shot perhaps 200 \"test\" images. Out of these, most are extremely sharp even magnified to 200% in Photoshop. While both lenses appear to focus quickly and properly in all lighting conditions, I had trouble at the 250mm end. In defense of the lens, I do NOT yet know how to change the focusing parameters (spot versus wide area)and I was trying to capture either a distant deer or bird both partly hidden in a mess of branches or trees. The camera did not know what I wanted to focus on. Exposure, color and contrast rendition are excellent!Oddly, in the full automatic setting, the camera wants to use the flash in situations that I do NOT believe call for flash. Interestingly, and useful for idiot-proof photography, in full automatic the camera's brain alters the ISO setting to afford \"optimum\" settings for a decent photo. They may not be the settings a knowledgeable photographer would choose, but they work!The camera body appears to be solid, properly designed, engineered and manufactured. Unfortunately, it is slightly heavier than the Nikon, which is a major factor for me.If you are looking for a DSLR in this price range, I highly recommend the Canon T3i (aka EOS 600D ).", "Date": "June 27, 2012"}, {"Title": "Hmmmm", "Author": "Tib", "ReviewID": "R3X1DK1V6CTGZ", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "I would have liked to know that my not-that-ancient version of Photoshop won't handle Nikon's new RAW files.
