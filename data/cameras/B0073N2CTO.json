Although it is Japanese only, it is fairly easy to follow if you have the online English manual available.  A lot of the icons are familiar and straight forward.  Some features, such as text annotation are not usable unless you are fluent in Japanese, but all the important ones are available and not too hard to use.  I orginally used red/cyan glasses and the free StereoPhotoMaker application to view my photos.  Acceptable, but not ideal.  I've since purchased a Viewsonic 3D monitor.  The pictures and movies are fantastic.  Love the effect.  The 2D images are also very nice with great color, just what you'd expect from a camera in the Lumix line.  Overall, very happy.  It would be nice if Panasonic would make the English firmware available for update...if that's possible. It would make it alot more usable. No one at Panasonic seems to be motivated though.  The PHOTOfunStudio application supplied with the camera is also Japanese only, but the english version can be purchased from Panasonic Global.  Unfortunately, the 3D images are only shown in 2D.", "Date": "July 15, 2013"}, {"Title": "Nice Camera", "Author": "Sasan", "ReviewID": "R36QGAVJ7TJNK0", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "The only problem is that the menu is in Japanese but I try my best to learn by try and error.

Poor 3D quality!", "Author": "B. Brent", "ReviewID": "RXT4VH4CZALZA", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "As a photographer/videographer for many years, I can easily see the quality difference between this camera and Fujifilm's W3 3D camera.  I've owned the W3 3D camera for over three years, but recently I must have either mishandled it, maybe a slight drop to the floor or a bump.  The right lens is out of sync and cannot be fixed w/o a costly (more $ than a new one) repair.  So, even though others here have given the Panny 3D camera mixed reviews, I took a chance.  Wow, I cannot believe the reviewers here giving this camera five stars.  The Panny's resolution is not as good as the Fujifilm's camera, in 3D mode.  I'll give the Panny 4 for 2D resolution. The interocular (distance between the two lens') distance on the Panny is just plain pathetic, whereas the Fujifilm's is perfect, just like our eyes.  Ghosting in the Panny is quite visible, whereas Fujifilm does not produce ghosting.  As far as a closeup with the Fujifilm's 3D effect, yes, it may be too close and hurt the eyes, BUT, you can close-up the distance with FREE SOFTWAREDo an Internet search, type in this exactly (without quotes) \"StereoPhoto Maker Ver4.52\"  No installation needed, it's just an executable (.exe) file.The above free software is very versatile, with distance adjustments, color correction, saving to different formats and creating stereo/3D images from non-3D images.I've returned the Panny and ordered another Fujifilm W3 camera.  But, this time, with Square Trade's insurance.  A great deal!", "Date": "February 3, 2014"}, {"Title": "Buy the Fuji 3D W3 instead!", "Author": "Joseph B. Mayshark \"sheep107\"", "ReviewID": "R2JRVLIQCWL354", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "As just a camera, this can't compare favorably in any way with most hundred-dollar point and shoots.  It's okay, but just barely.  But as a 3D camera it has two serious shortcomings: 1.Whereas when in 2D mode it's a reasonably adjustable camera: it has various modes, and manual overrides, which allow a reasonable amount of control. But when in 3D mode, it becomes a totally auto camera with no manual adjustments possible. 2. Much more significant: the lenses are only one and a quarter inches apart.  Average adult human eyes are two and a half inches apart, which is where stereo cameras have traditionally placed the lenses. The result of this in the pictures taken by this camera is Stereo Lite: the 3D effect is very diminished.  It's hard to imagine why anyone would make a 3D camera with the lenses so close together.  Get the Fuji 3D W3 - it has some shortcomings too, but it's MUCH better than this Panasonic, and is also currently being remaindered at very low prices - Amazon has it for under $190, and Newegg is (at this moment anyway) selling refurbished ones for $125.

The japanese version is usable for other languages, as most functions are indicated by icons.The base of the lenses is 30mms,that means it is good for photos in the range from 80 cms on. Everything that is more than 5m away looks flat. If you don't have distant background: very good 3D in the range 40 - 80 cms. Alas no 3D display and no manual setup for 3D.

Bear in mind it's best for closer shots because of the 30mm lens separation, but that is perfect for video display on a large-screen 3D TV.
