I am unsatisfied with the focus on the automatic setting function.  Nothing comes out clear.  Most of my pics are blurry!  I bought this point and shoot so I didn't have to carry my heavy DSLR for a vacation. I wanted the ease of turning the camera on and taking a quick picture. No other point and shoot that I've owned have I ever had a problem with focusing.  That is the concept of this type of camera.  I may be returning if I still can.", "Date": "July 22, 2013"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": "$154.00", "Features": "16.2MP CCD Image Sensor - ISO 100 to 12800\n3.0\" 230k-Dot LCD - Wi-Fi Direct, Email\n25-125mm f/2.5 5x Optical Zoom Lens - 2D Panorama, Smart Auto, Smart Movie\nCapture HD 720/30p Video - Face, Blink and Smile Detection\nDirect LINK, Mobile Link, Remote VF - microSD/microSDHC Memory Card Slot", "Name": "Samsung ST150F 16.2MP w/ WiFi Ready Smart Compact Digital Camera in White + 8GB Deluxe Accessory Kit", "ImgURL": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51jm%2By5eT2L._SY300_.jpg", "ProductID": "B00BSFZ0VU"}}
