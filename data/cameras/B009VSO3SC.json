{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Golf specific camera works well", "Author": "R. Klein", "ReviewID": "R3EWE7ST07R0RX", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This camera differs from the other high speed EXILIM models as it was designed to allow one person to capture his own golf swing.  The viewing screen rotates so that it faces the same direction as the lens.  It then triggers a 5 second video (preceded by a countdown) that is initiated by a wave of the hand.The camera has presets for evaluating swings taken facing the golfer and taken from behind.  It is easy to spot lateral body movement and swing plane; also if the clubface is open in the set position.Aside from golf, the camera is fine for conventional photos.  I installed an Eye-Fi SD card which works great to upload files for storage or sharing.  The camera's software allows this feature to be turned on or off.", "Date": "June 28, 2013"}, {"Title": "Excellent!", "Author": "mark winkley", "ReviewID": "R2KQ8G26ZMI1CU", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "If you have interest in filming and reviewing your golf swing, this is the only camera needed.
