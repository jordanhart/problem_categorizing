{"Reviews": [{"Title": "First Digital Camera and Happy as a Pig in Shhhhhh!", "Author": null, "ReviewID": "R1W75SP8S36IV5", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "After many hours of research I am happy to review the Canon A70 Powershot.  My first and probably only digital camera for a long time.Easy to use, simple to learn, and compact.I don't mind the 4 AA batteries.  I bought \"good\" recharable and have taken about 100 photos and a video on the first set with no end in sight yet.The camera has many \"bells and whistles\" but not that many buttons and settings to use them.  Tricky.The autofocus takes about 20 pictures to get used to, but then it is a worthy attribute.I love the stitch command.  When you're standing in front of scenery that is 4 or 5 pictures long, the downloading software will \"Stitch\" them together into one long picture...very cool.The camera is small but not too small.  The camera comes with all the downloading software you need and works with all the \"photoshop\" software that my Dell computer already came with.The user manuals are useful, and not totally technical geeky.Trust me, 3.2 Mpix is just fine.  The only reason to get 5.0 Mpix or higher is if you're making posters or just want to say \"it's a 5.0 Mpix\".  My opinion is don't waste your money, just get this camera.  It'll do everything and anything that \"joe-shmoe\" picture taker needs.The only bummer, is the 16bit (or whatever the measurement is) card that the camera comes with.  It only holds about 25 pics or maybe 30 to 45 seconds of video.  I'm checking for a 128 or 256 card that will hold more pics than I know what to do with (download them and take more).  They make a 516 but again, do I need all that or do I just need to say \"it's a 516 card\".Don't worry, the card is like a floppy disk.  It just clicks in and out.  BUT BEWARE, my friends told me if you take the cards in and out constantly you run the risk of bending or tweeking the tiny connector pins in the camera that connect the card to the camera.  If you do this...time to buy another camera.  This goes for all digital cameras so I'm getting a bigger card for $$$ to $$$ bucks and will never take the card out again (just download them, erase them, and keep on shooting).Which come to think of it...you know those Windows Media Player videos all your friends send you at work...this camera takes those.  The software downloads it as a WMP video and then asks, \"want to e-mail this?\"...heck ya, this is fun.Word to the wise...if you plan on taking action photos of fast moving/fast action sports or activities you might want to research more expensive digital cameras that can take 3 or 5 frames per second.  This camera can do it but not every picture may be in focus as the \"shoot\" button focus' the shot when pressed half way down, lets you know it's in focus, and then you press all the way down and it shoots.  If you just shoot away it focus' as best it can and takes the shot.The camera does not come with a little camera bag, but hey, most of the little bags provided with electronic stuff is lame anyway.  It does come with a cord to hold it, but I didn't put it on.Lastly...NO LENS COVER...totally cool, it has it's own that opens and closes when you turn it on and off.  Nothing to lose and no \"uh duh take the lens cap off\" moments.Hope this has been useful.  A very worthy purchase.  ....", "Date": "June 1, 2003"}, {"Title": "amazing value with room for creativity - plus 3MP resolution", "Author": "jemaerca", "ReviewID": "R39M9AF4MNZ7TZ", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "this camera is perfect for people who are starting off their digital camera career.  it will work as a point and shoot but this is a camera you can hone your creativity on.  when you're ready to experiment, the A70 provides a high degree of manual control for a camera at this price point.pros:- very nice resolution- 3x optical zoom lens- amazing manual control for the price: manual focus, selectable ISO sensitivity, and exposure (aperture priority, shutter priority, or manual)- good metering and good tonal balance - maintains shadow detail- good natural light white balance, strong and balanced colours- AF assist lamp helps auto-focus for low light situations- nice layout of controls and easy to understand- very nice build quality - feels more expensive than what its price would suggest- bright, detailed LCD monitor- good shot-to-shot times, quick start-up time too- movie clip mode up to 3 minutes- low noise at ISO 50 (keep in mind that ISO 50 for this camera is actually ISO 100 for everyone else; likewise, ISO 100 is in reality closer to ISO 200, etc)- impressive battery life plus it uses non-proprietary AAs (but i'd recommend buying rechargeables)- excellent value - no one else offers this feature set at this price levelcons:- slight chromatic aberrations visible- AF Assist lamp doesn't have enough power at telephoto zoom- moderately underexposed flash shots- RAW format not supported- no histogram available - useful to see if photos have correct exposure- distracting mirror finish frame surrounds the LCD monitor- competition is lighter and smaller, but also does not give the same amount of manual control- the supplied 16MB CF card is not adequate - be ready to shell out more $$ for more memoryi was surprised by this camera.  at its price point, it has the most features among cameras available today.  this camera will work well with beginners (but who'll want to spread their \"creative\" wings later) but will not disappoint more advanced photographers on a budget.  definitely a camera to add to your short list.", "Date": "August 14, 2003"}, {"Title": "Great Design, Great Pictures, Good Standards", "Author": null, "ReviewID": "R35WG162OPCHXU", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "There were two things that really turned my head about this camera.  The first was it's use of Compactflash memory.  This memory is highly available, available in large storage sizes (512 megs, 1gig, etc) quite affordable, and can easily be used as a usb drive on nearly any computer system with an adapter.The second feature that intrigued me was their use of standard batteries.  I've had camera's before used expensive disposable lithium batteries (upwards of $15 a piece)...and if your on vacation, it can be a pain to try and find something to bring your camera back to life instead of working on a suntan.  Even though I've been using recharchable NimH batteries in this camera since I've had it it is very nice to know that I should be able to find spare batteries for it almost anywhere if I'm in a pinch.Now that I've had the camera, I can say that I am very impressed:  It fits well in the hand, is simple to use, is feature rich, and has enough interactive feedback available on the display to help you get great shots even in tricky situations.This is a nicely featured camera at a great price - and the standards they've chosen have created a low cost of ownership.", "Date": "June 4, 2003"}, {"Title": "Great Digital Camera", "Author": "M. Bradley", "ReviewID": "R1A3OG1VO99DDN", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This is my first digital camera purchase, so I did a lot of research to find the best camera for [the price].  I can say with certainty that this camera fits the bill!  It is 3.2 Megapixels, which some may not feel is enough, but unless you are going to print out photos larger than 8x10 I don't see any reason you would need a higher resolution.  In fact, most of the pictures we take aren't even at the highest resolution possible.The 16MB CompactFlash card that comes with this camera is way too small.  Look at getting at the very least a 128 MB card, or even a 256MB or 512MB card.I don't have any complaints about this camera.  In dark situations, the LCD becomes very grainy, but the pictures you take look great.  Red eye reduction works wonders as I have yet to see any red eyes from pictures I've taken.  In the sun, the LCD similarly gets sun circles, but those are not apparent in the final image when you take a picture.  The shiny chrome finish around the LCD is a little hard to deal with in the sun, but it's easy enough to get used to.I highly recommend this camera.  It's geared toward the point-and-shoot consumer, but it has settings and the ability to add attachments for the more avid photographer.", "Date": "June 3, 2003"}, {"Title": "A professional camera in a small package and GREAT price!", "Author": "Hebron H. Mak", "ReviewID": "R22UBUJEEVT6C5", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This camera has features that are absolutely unheard of in its price range.  It has full auto controls, full manual controls (i.e. Shutter-speed priority, Aperture priority, and manual focus), as well as a dozen or so photo effects.  They use the same DIGIC processor and AiAF system (5-point) as higher end models, so pictures come out very crisp and clear.  Night shots are great as well, thanks to the AF-assist lamp, which is not a standard in other brands.  One minor problem with night pictures is the red-eye effect, even with the red-eye reduction mode.  This is somewhat expected, seeing how close together the lens and the flash is.  However, this can be easily corrected with the included software package.Another deciding factor for me is their use of standard AA batteries instead of a proprietary battery pack, which can be fairly expensive.  In a cram, I can just run to the store and grab batteries off a shelf, or have another set of NiMH rechargeables handy.  I also love the body size.  I was considering buying a Canon S230, which is one of the smallest digicams out there.  However, the ELPH series do not have any manual controls, the flash is weak, has a lower power zoom (2x as oppose to 3x), and they use a proprietary battery pack.  The A70 is only slightly large than the ELPH.  I actually like the size and the right hand grip on the A70, which gives you better control and balance of the camera.The A70 is a very quick camera.  It takes about 2.5 seconds for the camera to power up and be ready to go.  Focus takes about a second, and you only have to wait about 1.5 seconds in between pictures.  In playback mode, it takes a little bit over a second to go between pictures in high res mode.  There is a lot of information displayed for each picture, with the exception of a histogram.  However, once the pictures are downloaded to the computer, you will have access to the histogram.Other bonuses that I like about the A70 is the Stitch Assistant mode, which helps you make great panoramic shots.  It also has a video capture mode (up to 3 min) as well as audio memos that you can add to each picture taken.  This camera also supports some direct printing to some printers.All in all, this is a great camera for a great price!  The pictures turn out great, even for a novice.  And for the adventurous, there are plenty of manual controls to play with.  There is no other camera in this price range that has all these features, combined with the great optics known for in Canon cameras.", "Date": "March 28, 2003"}, {"Title": "Awesome camera- just the right balance!", "Author": "Michael Chen \"chunkychen\"", "ReviewID": "R3565ITT0JNOZ8", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I received my Canon A70 about a week ago in the mail.  This is my second digital camera- my first being an old Olympus D360-L point and shooter.  Thus far, I love my new camera!  I can go on and on about it, but I'll try to summarize what I like and don't quite like about it.Likes1. Lots of manual controls - shutter speed, real manual focus, white balance2. Great pre-sets - these let me take great pictures for certain pre-set environments (fast action, portrait, panoramic, slow shutter, etc...)  Easily accessible on dial at the top of camera3. Nice size - not too small and light, so my twitchy hands don't mess it up too much, but not bulky like some of the other cameras with manual controls4. Battery life - I still have not run out of a charge, during a day or two's use.  (Note: I use 1600 mA LiMH batteries and charge them after every day or two)5. Sharp screen - hi-resolution screen, though not terribly bright in direct sunlight6. Great looking pictures!7. Video mode, with sound up to 640x480 for 30 secs, and lower resolutions for much longer.8. Looks great!9. Able to fit additional lenses as well as waterproof housing (Not that I'm planning on getting these yet, but its nice to know I have the choice to!)Not Likes:1. Takes a bit of time for the zoom lens to extend when turning the camera on.2. Plastic tripod mountI've printed my cropped 8x10\" photos out on my Canon S600 printer on glossy paper and they look awesome!Anyways, I really like this thing a lot, so I heartily recommend this to people who are looking for a point-and-shoot, as well as those who are trying to learn to dabble a little bit more with their camera's manual controls (like myself!)", "Date": "March 31, 2003"}, {"Title": "Feels good in the hands", "Author": "S. Brand \"sandra807\"", "ReviewID": "RF7GCKQMLPPV5", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Besides the Canon name, the first thing that draws me to this camera is the way it fits in the hand with its right-hand grip, and its just-right size...not wafer thin, but not bulky, either.  I've had the camera since August, and I'm going to start with its few problems, and then list all the things I like about it:Problem 1: Maybe it's just this particular camera, but sometimes the macro lens just does not want to focus on the closeup object.  I have had to turn the camera off and on a few times to get the macro to work.  You know it's working when a little frame appears to show you what it's focusing on.  It has a very hard time finding the object if it is similar to the background color. I discovered that sometimes the focus frame doesn't appear just because I'm trying to take the picture from too close, so I have to back it up a bit.  Because I use the macro lens a lot for photographing items that I sell, it is not the absolute best for macro photography, but I have been able to get some spectacular photos with it, especially if I do some detailing in Photoshop Elements.Problem 2: Bright red and blue come out too intense, and I often have to tone them down in Photoshop.Problem 3:  Screen hard to see in sunlight.That's all for the problems!Positives: Can take about 300 photos on rechargeable batteries.  It has a lens cover that opens and closes automatically when you turn the camera on or off (NO CAP!)  The buttons are placed in easy-to-find places and work easily.  They are not itsy-bitsy so I don't accidentally hit the wrong one.  No toggle buttons!  It's easy to figure out how to do some photography besides just point and shoot.  With a little time reading the manual, I learned how to turn off the automatic button, and take pictures on the manual switch, adjusting the amount of light allowed in the lens...easy.  Crisp, clear photos.  Takes short movies with sound.  Sturdy, reliable, and once again... feels just right in the hands.  I am not a professional photographer, but have found it a great, inexpensive digital camera to use in my business, and the photos sell my products!  Great price for what you get!", "Date": "November 25, 2003"}, {"Title": "Fantastic manual controls,  not-fantastic lens", "Author": "Joel Cohen", "ReviewID": "R22PQ119L4EL8K", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "Basically my headline says it all.  I love this camera's ability to set f stops, shutter speeds,  ASA/ISO speeds,  under/over- exposure etc etc.  Particularly useful to me is the ISO 400 setting -- set the camera there you can take lots of pics indoors without a flash (like film cameras usibg hi speed film,  the images will be grainy,  but useable).The main problem is the lens.  It performs overall less well than my 2 previous digital cameras (Fuji 2400 and 2800,  which regularly gave me tack sharp pictures).  This lens gives you OK shots,  but often without that extra edge of definition,  despite the high number of pixels.  There is a fair amount of flare at large apertures,  and the program modes like to keep the lens wide open and aim for higher shutter speeds. One workaround to this problem is to use the aperture proiority mode and to stop the lens down to f 4.5 or so.I am keeping this camera because of all the creative control it gives me,  but I still have a Fuji 2400 in my desk drawer when I need to take a really sharp product photo for ebay.", "Date": "July 6, 2003"}, {"Title": "Canon Powershot A70 is simply amazing", "Author": "dragonlady", "ReviewID": "R36HHDROBG0R46", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "After doing TONS of research over a span of about two months, i finally bought this camera.  I tried it out in stores (along with many others) and it was simply the best for the money.  Though it may not be one of those TINY pocket cameras, i never had a problem fitting it in the pocket of my cargo pants or jeans.  If you are unsure about this camera, this may help:1. Great quality pictures.  Believe me, 3.2 MP is plenty for the average person.  Amazing quality up untill 8 by 10 inches2. Though it is not advertised, the camera lasted through a day of pouring rain while i was hiking without a problem.  It was very wet, but even in a cloud on the top of a mountain i found no problem with the camera.  I would still suggest avoiding wet weather (just in case), but it stood up fine for me.3. Panoramic mode is really great - stiches very easily together4.  Movies have great quality with long length - sound works well, i have a lot of fun with them.5. Software is simple to use, easy to upload pictures6. TV output made it easy to show everyone the pictures7. Long battery life (with rechargeables)9. Nice zoom + nice quality = good editing.  I was able to zoom way in on pictures i took in NYC from a building to see the license plate numbers clearly - the quality is that good!10. easy to switch between modes11. personalizeable12. Reasonable weight - not cumbersome evern for long hikesThe only problems I encountered with this camera are:1. Long period of time between when you press the shutter button and when it takes the picture - if you are going to need to catch very fast shots of things (maybe whale watching) you could have a problem - i solved this however by using the movie mode and taking out the frame i wanted on the computer. 2. Took a while to get the correct settings for museum shooting.  too bright, too dark - i did get it to work well eventually.  it just needs some fiddling.3. The software isnt amazing, you may want to buy a better program for editing.I would suggest buying several accesories for the camera:1. a larger memory card (I got a 512 MB card so i would never need another, and I am very happy with it.  It stored every picture I toook over the span of a week in the Virgin Islands no problemo.  at highest quality, you can take over 300 pictures without a worry!2. Rechargable batteries (i got 2200) they last very long!3. a good caseAll in all, this is an amazing camera.  a solid choice for everyone except maybe a professional photographer.  after the research, this is definately the best value for the money.", "Date": "June 2, 2004"}, {"Title": "This review is for all the wary non-technical buyers", "Author": "\"hlkeenly\"", "ReviewID": "R309W8AGVRX0UJ", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "First off, let me tell you that I researched the heck out of digital cameras before buying this one.  I read some of the disappointment reviews which made me hesitate....DON'T!  I put months into my decision and for the price, this camera is by far the best out there!  I PROMISE you will love it.  Here are just a few points I want to make.First:You are getting a Canon lens with this camera.  I would rather have a 1 MP Canon camera (my SLR is Canon and I have never been let down) than a 4 MP of many other brands.  The quality you get with the Canon name alone is worth it.Second:This camera is VERY user friendly if you take the TIME to figure it out.  As for the person complaining about the slow shutter speed, if they took the time to understand their camera they would have realized that the button has two features.  Your not supposed to just snap the picture.  You push the button half way to focus (which gets you a great picture), once the camera focuses for you it will beep so that you know its ok to take the picture.  Thats way you tell everyone to say cheese!  The shutter opens immediately upon taking the picture.  If you do not take that two step approach, the camera does a quick focus (which usually is not accurate) and then the shutter opens (hence the few second delay)Third: The person complaining about the software conflicts....it has nothing to due with camera...those are just the brakes of computers...sometimes there is a glitch....the camera is still amazing!Do not hesitate!  Its small, its user friendly, its a Canon, its worth every penny!", "Date": "April 28, 2003"}, {"Title": "great controls, alright photos", "Author": "LuWeGeeeeeee", "ReviewID": "RL8A7VFEKSQC1", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "This camera offers all the manual controls you need, plus several preset shooting modes to simplify life, at a very cheap price!.  Because it uses 4 AA batteries instead of specialty expensive lithion-ion batteries, you can shop around for the cheapest recharble nimh's.  Also because it uses the Compact Flash card, these cards are readily the cheapest out there, and availble in large sizes, plus any multi card reader usually has the compact flash, because it's the most used card in electronics.  the camera itself is a bit bigger then u'd assume, but can fit funnily in most kahki pants pockets- jean wearers beware if u wear semi fit to tight jeans.  The photos this camera takes can be quite exellent, although as with all digital photos, extra sharpening is advised(around 80%-100% i'v found is adequate).  Also purple fringing is very noticible in shorts with high contrast in light levels.. such as fireworks.  Colors are perfect matches, while it may seem like those kodak cameras can take better looking photos, it is because kodak uses a special algorithm to make the colors more saturated and whatnot, in other words, kodak manipulates the colors of images so they look better then real-life, whearas canon photos are 100% exact color matches nearly all the time.  ISO 50 to 400 are available , but once again i advise not to use higher then iso100 because images become significantly noisey with extreme film grain visibility.. \"iso\" is the light sensitivity of the camera to take brighter pics in lower light levels, but at the cost of grain and noise(grain and noise are pixels of unnaturual colors within the photograph, that cause the photo to look very \"digitally processed).  The camera comes with a new digic proccessor which speeds up the focosing tremendously, and allows for faster operations in general.. for example the time it takes to turn the camera on is about 2-3 seconds, and the time the camera actually takes the picture after u press the shutter release button is unnoticeable. with about 2 seconds between single shot images, but u can also use drive mode, where u hold the shutter button and it can take about 10 pics at 2pictures per second. then u need to wait 6-10 seconds for the images to write to the memory card.  The camera now has 5 focusing areas within the image, and the camera chooses the best ones to focus with, this may be quicker and easier some of the time, preferably i turn this off and just use the center box to focus so that i know what the camera will focus on myself.  the ability to manually focus is very helpful, because u can set the focus to infinity for fireworks or landscapes without relying on the \"landscape\" preset mode, also it allows you to prefocus on a spot so u can take photos quicker for fast action events.  Almost forgot a big detail-movie mode. this camera offers VGA resolutions of 640 by 480 pixels, at 15 frames per second. you can take up to 30seconds of video at a time with this resolution, or u can use lower resolutions for 3 minute video clips at a time.  personally i love this! i always use the larger resolution and end up filling my camera with more movie clips then photos at parties or special events!  the files are saved as .avi extentions  and can be played using most all movie players such as windows media player.  Also if u have windows xp, and have downloaded the windows movie maker 2, you can use this clips to make a pretty darn good short film to help you remember those special and fun events in life!  This camera is a great find, and buy for the manual, preset, and auto modes it provides  along with canon's reputable brand name(canon by the way makes all the parts to their camera's themselves, in other words, canon owns all facilities used to make their cameras).  The photos this camera takes are great and may be printed without any need to enhance the images afterwords.. but it's advised to use an autoimage correction, and some sharpening and see if the picture looks beter afterwords.  And if the pictures u take look a little, dull in the colors, just use the \"vivid\" setting and make ur colors stick out more!  ***recommendations:  You need to buy at least 1 or 2 4 packs of AA rechargable Nimh batteries, with a charger.  You'll want to buy a case of some sort for this camera,  Buy a Compact Flash card! this is very serious! i would recommend transcend 32x cards or lexmark 32x and up cards. i use a 256mb card, and still find it's not enough space for all the video clips and photos i take!  Take the time to buy a compact flash card reader for your computer while your at it, this allows faster write speeds from the card to your computer, and does not drain your camera's batteries.  Invest in a microfiber cloth to clean your lense, if someone touches the lense(whenever i let someone hold my camera they end up pressing on the lense without knowing it, because they are used to larger film cameras!).  DO NOT USE GLASS CLEANER ON THE LENSE, OR AN ORDINARY CLOTH, glass cleaning solvent contains chemicals that can harm and damage the lense special chemical coatings, and an ordinary cloth scratches the lense even if u cant see the scratches by looking into the lense.  personally i find just buying a microfiber cloth and using ur breath's moisture enough to clean the lense, without needing to buy a special lense cleaning solvent.  u may want to look at the sony dsc-p8 or p-72, the kodak dx6340, minolta dimage s404, or olympus d-560 zoom.", "Date": "July 9, 2003"}, {"Title": "It does have issues, but I don't leave home without it", "Author": "Dylan E Wilbanks", "ReviewID": "R2LER6C781RQN5", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Let me get the negatives out of the way first. This camera does have a soft focus, and that can be a problem if you are a precise focuser. About 90% of the time the autofocus picks up what the center of attention should be, but for the other 10% of the time learn to use the manual focus. If you're taking family snapshots, you'll be fine, so long as they're not moving too fast. This leads to the other issue: there's a slight delay (1/2 sec at the highest photo settings) when you take a shot. Most of the time, it's not noticable, but if you're trying to take action shots with precise shutter timing, it'll take some practice. The delay is much, much better than some of the waits I've experienced on older cameras -- sometimes it was a full second or more. More to the point, if you're a photo perfectionist, then why are you buying a 3MP digital camera in the first place? You should save your money and buy a digital SLR where you don't have the limitations that come with cameras in this range.All that said... you can have my camera when you pull it from my cold, dead fingers. I've had experience with a number of digital cameras, and I've never had one that actually makes me look like a good photographer. The A70 is a great fully automatic camera, but its manual settings make it the \"missing link\" between the entry-level and SLR models. I've never seen a $...camera that gives you this much control over your shots -- shutter speed, aperture, focus, white balance, film speed, and exposure are all under your control in program mode. There are a number of presets (e.g. fast shutter, variable aperture and time, and a few more I can't remember right now) that allow you to take control of only the settings you want to control. You can also attach proprietary lenses (with a sold-seperately attachment ring), adding still more flexibility. And, while it does have a learning curve, you can take great shots straight out of the box -- something I couldn't say for some of the earlier digital camera models I've used. If you're looking for a camera that gives you manual control, but you're not rich enough or ready to go for the high-end digi SLRs, give a long look at the Canon A70.Two other things I should mention. One, it does take 4 AA batteries, but this is a good thing IMO, since it means longer operational time for the camera. Pick up a couple sets of NiMH batteries and a charger. I took the A70 on a four hour hike and one set of fully charged NiMH cells. Never lost operation of the camera. (I didn't keep it on the whole time, but I've used digital cameras in the past that would have petered out an hour in, even with limited operation.) Two, get at least one (preferably two) 128MB or larger Compact Flash cards.

This camera can take nice outdoor shots, indoor (low light) shots as well as above average night shots. This camera has a fast 35-110mm lens (f/2.8-f/4.8). Please note that many digital cameras out there have 38-39mm lens, which I find a bit limiting, when it comes to capturing scenes/landscapes. This camera has a nice movie mode and offers a variety of modes ranging from fully auto, programmed auto, shutter/aperture priority and full manual control. Also, it is quite user-friendly. In a nutshell this camera is capable of surprising you with its rich feature-set. ... The pictures that I took from this camera came out very nice and sharp. I took some indoor shots - in low light - without flash and they came out very nice and with acceptable level of noise. Minor irritation - this camera doesn't allow setting the white balance in the \"full Auto\" mode as sometimes I just want to change white balance and let the camera take care of rest of the parameters. However, you can fallback on the programmed auto mode, where camera picks shutter speed and aperture, and you pick the rest.

Going digital with the Canon Powershot was the most sensible move I could have made.Things I like about this camera:- the 3 megapixel resolution allows printing of very clean, clear photos on glossy paper;- colors are natural-looking, vivid and realistic- the ISO setting of up to 400 makes it easy to take photos without flash- CompactFlash cards are cheaper than the other alternatives on the market- the software included allows easy transfer of photos via USB- power-up time is minimal- the camera is a comfortable weight, and feels like a more expensive camera to the touch- battery life (when using standard rechargeable Ni-MH AA batteries) is more than satisfactory for the casual photographer (I take maybe 50 photos a week, most without flash but with the LCD on, and only have to recharge once a month or so)- photos taken using digital zoom, while looking grainy on the LCD, end up with surprisingly crisp clarity overallThings I dislike:- no 800x600 resolution setting (sometimes 640x480 seems too small and 1024x768 too large for photos shared over the web or used in PowerPoint slide shows)- inept redeye settings (it never seemed to work too well for me - is there something I'm missing?);- photos taken in sepia seem a tad yellowish for my taste (possibly a problem that could be adjusted in printing)- the meager selection of LCD display background and sounds- camera cannot read or display photos from a CF card that have been edited and resaved in a separate PC application (the LCD just shows a question mark)- slightly flimsy focus knob/level (I would have preferred a bit more solid feel)- removing the CF card requires a bit of a trick to get the lid off (it's fine once you get used to it, however)- focus cannot be adjusted while recording video, and the sound quality of the built-in speaker is comparable to a cheap child's toy- some purple stripes appear on the LCD in certain lighting conditions during shooting (these do not appear in the final photo, however)All this said, for the main reasons why I bought this camera, I haven't regretted the purchase. (But for sharing photos over the web, the single most aggravating point is the lack of a 800x600 photo resolution setting! Alas, that is what Photoshop is for...) The camera is simple enough to use, feels sturdy, takes photos that are of excellent quality, and the benefits of this camera far outweigh the disadvantages IMO. Although I'm no expert photographer, I feel like I have purchased a product that will satisfy my basic needs and my creative needs for years to come.", "Date": "July 25, 2003"}, {"Title": "GREAT VALUE, BUT CONSIDER CANON'S OWN S-230", "Author": "Shashank Tripathi", "ReviewID": "RICDPN1TW0N0R", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "The A70 is a very decent entry-level digicam with the usual benefits that come from any Canon family camera: excellent options for a point-and-shoot lightweight camera. But, if you are looking for your first digicam purchase and a smallish camera to carry around, I'd recommend you to also consider at the sleek S series line from Canon, or the smaller Nikons, or more recent versions of the Minolta Dimage. Since I am recommending AGAINST the A70, I'll focus in this review on what is NOT necessarily so cool about this camera -- (1) The A70 comes with 3.2 megapixels. The S230 comes with 3 megapixels. Not that big of a difference especially if you consider the somewhat heftier price tag for A70.(2) Images are not as vivid as the S-series cams. The feel of the pics is a bit blurred (soft focus) and need sharpening in a photo-editing software. Quickly gets tiring.(3) You'll find the camera is prone to the dreaded \"E18 error\". Google for it.(4) Uses AA batteries, which means shorter usage time than Lithium-ion.(5) When you zoom in in dark surroundings, without Flash, the pictures have a problem with horizontal lining that is a pain to get rid of.(6) Miniscule memory card included with camera forcing purchase of upgrade immediately.(7) The ON-OFF button is a pain to operate in this design.(8) Frequent purple fringing, plus red colors appear frequently as purples in the pics.(9) Speaking of which, there is red-eye galore, even with the red eye reduction setting turned on. I'm speaking of a 2003 model and while you read this review, Canon may have released a newer series of these digicams. Caveat Emptor.

However, unless you make prints over 8x10 inches, you'll never notice the difference with a 3.2mp camera.  Finally, the lag time is due to the autofocus.  An inexpensive point-and-shoot uses fixed focus (which produces a blurrier image, especially at close range), and therefore has no lag time.  In fact, the lag time on this camera is much quicker (and therefore better) than other digital cameras I have used.", "Date": "April 5, 2003"}, {"Title": "An advanced camera for a point-and-shoot price", "Author": "Rrrockhound", "ReviewID": "R1A0IE6ODZVK3I", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I consider myself a knowledgeable amateur and I wanted a digital camera that would let me manipulate shutter speed, aperture, etc.  The A70 has these features and will accept other lenses (wide angle, telephoto, macro) if you decide to expand later on.  It's also suitable for novices who think they might want to experiment later.The menu structure is easy to navigate through.  I love the speed at which the camera powers up and takes shots.  As with any digital, there is a lag, but it's minimal.  The thick instruction manual is a little daunting at first, but the Quick Start guide gets you going quickly.  Do read the manual, though, because it would be a shame not to learn all the tricks this pup can do, such as stitching together panoramic shots.  The autofocus works well, and even though it sometimes reports trouble getting a fix in low light, it almost always delivers a satisfactory focus.  Manual focusing is easy to do, if you decide to resort to it.  The macro mode picks up stunning detail on the highest resolution setting.  The LCD screen is tiny, but it has high resolution and crams a wealth of status and mode information into the space it has.I got about 4 hours of shooting time out of the supplied alkaline batteries the camera came with.  You'll definitely want to get a set of NiMH rechargeables, but it's nice to know that alkalines will keep you shooting in a pinch.  The camera's structure seems pretty robust, although the plastic lens over the LCD screen is probably not scratch-proof.  Buy a case.  The bundled software is excellent, too.  I've deleted all the other photo software on my computer and now I just use Canon's.  My biggest complaint is the power-saving feature, which shuts the camera down a little too soon for my taste.  It would be nice if you could set the power-off time to whatever length you want.  Also, it's a little hard to remember what the two LEDs next to the viewfinder are telling you.  There's no brightness control on the LCD screen, so it can be a little hard to see in bright sunlight, but you can always fall back on the optical viewfinder.If you just want a point-and-shoot camera, the A70's full list of capabilities may not excite you, but you'll still appreciate the high 3 megapixel resolution.

Soft-focus in the A70 is barely noticeble if at all.  This is still considered a entry-level camera guys, so if you're a professional photographer than you're really short of money or you stink.  Believe me I tried every brand 3MP camera out there, even bought and returned a couple (at places w/o restocking fee), and Canon A70 far outbeats them except for a few higher-priced, metal case, 3MP Canon models.  To me in addition to the great indoor/outdoor picture quality, the biggest asset is the longetivity of the battery life.  I bought 4 rechargeable 4 NiMH batteries (no-brand) and they lasted 4 days on vacation.  Are you kidding me, there's digital cameras out there that need a life support system just to last a couple of hours.For those who think this has blurriness, try the Olympus 560 model.  That'll make you think twice before complaining of blurriness.Heaviness of the camera, focusing delay, and the other gripes I hear are so typical of the many who try only one camera and never did research at other brands at the same level.

Most Canon cameras have received nothing but praise, and I bought this one with rather high expectations. Outdoor shots in bright sunlight do not produce the sharpness and color saturation I expected based on my experience with Fuji. If you are planning to take lots of nature photos including trees and shrubbery, perhaps A70 will not be the best choice. Soft focus is very apparent with tree leaves. However, in low light and contrasting light situations, the camera produces excellent shots of people that are even better than the photos I took with my Canon SLR. It will certainly produce the 'wow' you are hoping for. Red eye in flash photos were not a major problem. Besides, the plethora of manual controls not found in any digital camera of its class will please anybody who would like to experiment. Again, the menu system were not as straight-forward as I expected.The best thing before buying a digital camera is to go the review sites and see the pictures for yourself. I particularly like the comparometer in imaging-resource.com that will display the same picture side by side on the screen taken by two cameras for your judgement. Unlike Canon A40 and the ELPH series, price of the A70 has dropped markedly soon after the debut. Does it tell us something? In my view, Canon S400 probably takes slightly sharper and saturated pictures, but apart from the higher price, it has its own limitations like lack of high-res movie mode, lack of extensive manual control, use of special batteries, etc. I find Canon A70 to perform the best all-around in its price range.", "Date": "May 8, 2003"}, {"Title": "Wonderful Camera.", "Author": "R. N. Radhakrishnan \"Data Maven\"", "ReviewID": "R37VS6WDDPBMCZ", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I owned a Kodak 3700 for some time before my brother took it, so I agonized and researched all the digital cameras I could afford before I bought this... the competition was the Fuji 3800 and maybe the Nikon Coolpix. The 6x zoom of the 3800 was the best part, but its problems reported in low-light photography pushed me to this Canon A70, and boy, am I glad!...Lemme count the ways I love it : 1. [nice] Shape and size. I take it out, and it automatically attracts attention. And it weighs right, and snuggles neatly into my right hand because of the small 'bump' on the right side. ( But I wonder how comfortable lefties would be with this; it might get in their way). And the size is optimal - while I hated the elph's tiny size, the bulkier dig cameras would not fit my docker pants, like the A70 does; and if I leave out the case, it even fits my formal-suit pocket without a bulge. 2.The LCD screen functions as good as gold in low light, back-light, whatever-light. I should know, I played around with a friend's 3800 and found it a challenge to shoot indoors. 3.The picture quality is as good as I expected for a 3.2mp; someday I might be able to shell out [big money] and buy a 5mp, but then, maybe not : the biggest print I would want would be the occasional 8x10, while 4x6 would be regular, and for that 3.2MP is good enough. 4.The time-lag from the button-press-to-shutter-snap is about half-a-second, noticeable but not irritating. I know this exists for all digital cameras, so I have grown to work around this by planning the picture. This means I cannot snap a 2 year old running across the room, but I could always capture an endearing grin while seated!  5.So many modes...! This one is bewildering in the options it gives the user; it even allows you to make it 'fully manual', which would mean you set the aperture, the shutter speed and everthing else. I am not there yet, but this is where I can experiment and learn a bit...;-) 6.Stich mode. This needs special mention. You put the A70 in this mode, and take a series of pics by panning the camera horizontally, and voila, you end up with a fantastic panoramic shot of your room (or a single family photo at a huge family gathering). I am no specialist (as you can tell), but the software took care of the lack of precision in my hands and 'stiched' the photos together seamlessly! I can think of dozens of situations I can use this. I need to re-visit the Grand Canyon now! 7.I tried out the video mode and found it pretty nice, though unnecessary in a digital camera; what's the camcorder for...? 8.The software provided is awesome. I rarely depend on bundled software with any gadget, but Canon has persuaded me that they must have a great software division. Not very bulky, and extremely useful and bugfree. 9.Lastly, the optional accessories are also great : the A70 allows a lens adaptor which means you could attach other lenses you want; and there is also an 'underwater-case' which would allow you to shoot inside the swimming pool. As soon as I get some money to splurge I am getting that, just for the experience! The wish-it-was-better list : 1. The 3x zoom. I wish Canon had an A80 (or whatever) with at least 6x zoom. Would have been worth the price. 2. Red-eye reduction. I managed a bunch of great frontal portrait pics without red-eye, but once in a while it does fail, as reported by many others. I am told the design of the camera needs to change before it becomes fool-proof (the flash should be at a distance from the lens). 3. I never bothered using the bundled AA batteries; just bought rechargeable NiMH; What was Canon thinking, non-rechargeables with a digital camera?! Maybe they should not even bother with batteries, and reduce cost by some $ ;-) 4. Similarly, the 16MB Compact Flash is too small; I bought a 128MB rightaway which allows me 135 pics in Superfine, highest resolution mode. 5. I am also told that the memory usable (Compact Flash Type I) is slow and outdated. It should be at least Type II, if not a totally different and faster type. For now I am fine with the small time-lag.To Summarize, go ahead and buy this.

I wanted a camera that actually felt like a camera in my hand, vs. some of the \"mini-digitals\" that I've seen. I've taken over 200 photos so far and am still using the AA batteries that came with the camera. I rarely use the LCD display to frame the photo, using the viewfinder instead. I purchased a SanDisk 256mb Premium Quality card. It cost $10 more than the standard 256mb card and is well worth it. I've tried the direct connect USB cable to download images from the camera to my computer. It was quick, easy, and worked very well.Of course with some flash shots you get some red eye, but that's easily edited.

After researching several online photo equipment review sites and looking at the cameras in local retail stores, I decided on the A70.  The facts that influenced my decision to purchase this camera were: size, weight, type of battery, ability to shoot in full automatic or with some level of manual control.  The additional advantages this camera offered, were the ability to use rechargeble batteries and add a macro or telephoto lens.The learning curve is very fast.  I didn't have time to get very familiar with the camera before leaving, but it didn't take long to learn how to make adjustments.  Digital cameras tend to be much smaller than film cameras and that affects their handling and controls.  The menus are easy to access and once familiar can be changed quickly.  At first I thought the words on the menus were difficult to read in the LCD but this became less of a problem with time and with my glasses on.  In outdoor light all LCD's tend to be difficult to see but this is a very bright LCD and indoors is fantastic for viewing pictures.  The macro worked wonderful.  If you are photographing a stationary object you could use the manual focus, but to photograph insects or anything that moves, use the autofocus in macro mode to get spectacular photos.I used a battery recharger with 2 sets of 4 rechargeable AA batteries, so I always had a spare set.  I used the LCD all the time and reviewed images at night of the day's photos, the batteries seemed to last forever.  As long as you have a recharger with an adapter for European current, you can plug it in at night in a hotel room and be ready for the next day.  The AA batteries can double in an emergency to power up your PDA with an adapter so you won't be carrying dead weight for only one device.The 16MB compact flash that comes with the camera is best left home.  Get a 512MB CF and you can put nearly 500 photos in L mode (2048 X 1536).  You can add music or a memo to your photos.  I added a music memo to a picture of a band playing 60 feet away and the camera recorded it flawlessly.  This camera also has a movie mode with sound.All controls are easy to access, the camera is well-balanced, and fast to turn on and off.  Don't be fooled into thinking this camera is too big.  Many of the new cameras are smaller, but they are not easy to get a grip on or hold with one hand without getting your fingers in the way of the lens.Once you get your pictures home it is easy to view them.

But since our old SLR camera broke (dropped it and never worked since), I wanted something to get good prints as well.Well, judging by the reviews, I figured I shouldn't write something without doing my homework as well. Also, I didn't want to write this after using the camera for one day. So I gave myself quite some time to play with it to give this review more detail. I would love to make a PRO vs. CON list, but to be quite honest, I haven't found any CONS.So, For the Features this camera has, the quality of the name and the lens, and the price you pay, you couldn't find a better camera anywhere.It has a great 3.0 Optical zoom, with a combined digital zoom, you can get up to 10X focus.It's the perfect point and shoot, but doesn't limit itself to beginners only as it has several (12) shooting modes...plus a manual mode where you can change the shutter speeds and aperature level.With the movie mode (which includes sound) you can choose three levels, which also includes the 640x400 AGP mode. I recommend trying out that setting and burning your videos on a CD and watching them on your DVD player. (pretty cool)The Digital zoom is hardly noticeable at all when I used the \"Super Fine\" setting....and that was at Max zoom.It has an easy to use panorama function where you can take 360 degree panorama shots. It also has a fairly simple stitch program in the software bundle to automatically put together your panorama shots into one using artificial intelligence...bla bla bla stuff.I agree that the 16M FC is barely sufficient if you want to take plenty of pictures. I would also recommend getting a card between 128 - 512...just as a suggestion...but that has nothing to do with the camera itself. Other than that, The camera is perfect, the quality of canon images are awesome, and battery life lasts quite a sufficient amount of time. Although I will always recommend that you get rechargables, not because the camera sucks up the juice (because it doesn't), but rechargable batteries are better for the environment. To give you an idea of how long the batteries last, I used the camera for about three straight days of constant picture shooting, movie making and lots of uploading to the computer. Overall I took about 600 shots (with a variety of different quality), and about 12 minutes messing around in moving mode...and the batteries finally started to give...so, battery life is exceptional.and that's about all I have to say", "Date": "June 18, 2003"}, {"Title": "Canon recall for CCD defects", "Author": "Ken Broomfield", "ReviewID": "R1OO8XLSUWHA2C", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "All PowerShot A70 owners who've seen problems with the camera sensor (CCD) failing to function or exhibiting excess noise or other image distortion should take advantage of a recall.

Olympus offers to repair cameras with CCDs that may be defective, regardless of whether the camera is currently exhibiting problems.This issue, combined with a Canon camcorder that is now unreliable due to a widely-seen recorder section problem, severely undermines Canon's reputation for quality.

Even though the body is plastic, it has a sturdy feel to it unlike some other cameras in this price range. Once it's in your hands, you pop in the 4 AA batteries, the compact flash card and, away you go. Put it in AUTO mode and you have a nice 3MP point and shoot camera that responds very well to varying light conditions and circumstances. In other modes you have control over; white balance, exposure compensation, Drive (Single shot, continuous shooting, self-timer), ISO speed, Light Metering, Image Quality and Photo Effect (Off, vivid color, neutral color, low sharpening, sepia, black & white) The other modes are: P-this mode is the same as AUTO but you have control over the above mentioned options. Av-Aperture Priority, you set the f-stop, the camera sets the shutter speed. Tv-Shutter Priority, you set the shutter speed, the camera sets the f-stop M-full manual, you have control over shutter speed, aperture, flash output, and focus. In addition to that, there's six other modes; Slow Shutter, Fast Shutter, Landscape, Night Scene and, Portrait. In these modes, the camera sets shutter and aperture to the appropriate settings for each situation. Also included is a Stitch mode which lets you take a series of photos and then combine with the software for a panoramic effect.The last mode on the camera is Movie Mode. In Movie Mode, you can record at 3 resolutions; 640 X 480, 320 x 240, and 160 x 120. In the largest format you can record for 30 seconds and, in the other two formats, you can record approx. 3 minutes. Movies are recorded with sound in the AVI format but unfortunately, you can not use the zoom while filming in this mode. Performance When you power the camera up, it takes about 3 seconds to warm up before it's ready to shoot. Once it's ready, you push the shutter down halfway to lock the autofocus and then depress the shutter fully. Now you have a pic! You can review it on the LCD if you want any where from 2 to 10 seconds. The LCD screen measures 1.5 inches and fairly clear and easy to see but it would have been nice to control the brightness.Next move inside to take some flash pictures. Here you'll use the autofocus illuminator to help the camera focus in low light. There's a small orange light on the front of the camera under the flash, when you focus, it comes on to make it easier for the camera to focus. This eliminates the long focus times that some other camera have in these situations if they can even focus at all. Also inside, you'll appreciate the fact that Canon put a decent flash on this little guy. It has a working distance of about 13 feet at the wide angle setting.Picture Quality is very good. Pictures come out sharp with accurate color tones. I do get red-eye sometimes in indoor shots but, not always and, not to the point that I would consider unacceptable. I have yet to have any incidences of \"purple fringing\" Software, etc. Canon supplies you with two software applications. One their own and the other is ArcSoft's. Both applications are good for basic image editing but, if you want something more you'll likely pick up Photoshop.Downloading photo's is pretty straight forward once the software is installed. Hook up the computer with the supplied cable to a USB port, turn it on and your computer (PC) will either open the appropriate program or, you'll have to. Once the program is open, pick the images you want and, hit File, Transfer. That's about it. You can also view images, and movies on a TV with the supplied cable.The only other things in the box (aside from the manual) are a 16MB Compact Flash card and, 4 AA batteries. In the highest resolution, you'll get 8 pictures on this card so, you'll probably want to purchase another one soon. The 4AA batteries will last about 100 pics so, consider purchasing some high capacity rechargeables also. The batteries and the CF card will set you back about another $... but, you'll thank yourself later.

I did my research for weeks before I chose this camera, and I am very grateful to finally choose this.", "Date": "April 14, 2003"}, {"Title": "DURABLE + great price, functionality, and picture quality", "Author": "David", "ReviewID": "RIOBROFGHHP47", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This is an excellent camera.  I have the Powershot A60 and have worked a bit with the A70.  The only difference on these cameras is that the A70 has more megapixels, other than that they are THE SAME.  The cameras offer various features, each with several different ways to manipulate the camera, including shutter speed and aperture.  For the beginner, it offers a few preset options that allow a quick switch to the desired need of the user.  The manual is very clear and easy to apply.  I would recommend this camera to someone wanting a point and click camera, as well as a more advanced person desiring some control of the camera.  The only complaint about these cameras is that they are poor for low light photos.  The low-light problem I have is in the requirement of using the flash and that the camera will usually not focus in low-light, creating not-so-nice blurry memories for many indoor family events.This camera has optional shutter speeds of up to 15 seconds, which I like to use with streams and other pictures involving water.  The speed has its highest shutter speed at 1/2000 of a second, which I haven't yet had success with, but will have fun playing with (it needs to be really bright for this).  I haven't yet played with the aperture, but it seems like it will be fun to play with as well.If you are wondering if you need 3 MP (A70), consider what you want to do with the pictures.  I would recommend a 3 MP if you want to do some cropping or want to blow up pictures greater than 5x7.  I simply use my A60 just for 4x6 and looking at pictures on my computer, which it does an excellent job of.I would recommend getting either a 128 or a 256 Mb compactflash card (cards used in these cameras) in addition to this camera (runs between $40 and $70), because the camera only comes with a 16 Mb card, which holds about 15-20 pictures.  I personally prefer Lexar's 12x or higher cards.  Get rechargable batteries!!!  Amazon's prices seems to be the cheapest for both cameras and compactflash cards (or within a couple bucks of other places).I would highly recommend either the Powershot A60 or A70 to anyone that wants a digital camera because of the versatility offered.-------------------------------Update:I have now had my Powershot A60 for over two years, and it is still functioning despite the serious abuse I have dealt to it. The camera has been dropped numerous times and has also taken a tumble down a 20 foot rocky steep hill (I thought it was a goner after that one). It has endured backpacking, rock climbing, and general outdoor adventures with me, and although its casing shows many scraps, dents, and scratches, the camera's functionality is beyond all of my expectations. The only problems that have developed is that the LCD seems to be dying slowly and about 20% of in-door poorly lit shots turn out grainy and have horizontal lines (all of which occurred after that major tumble, so I expect that is the cause); that is, 80% of in-door shots still look great. At the prices you can find this camera at around the internet, it is an awesome intro and general use digital camera, and with the low price, you can even pick one up for your kid (since it is now so cheap -- look elsewhere than Amazon). Anyways, I am looking to pick up a second one of these for the inevitable event that I completely destroy this sturdy camera.Also, in its 2 years of use, I can honestly say that I have not found a single time where I truly needed more than my 2 MP to get a great shot. I have taken this camera to the Canadian Rockies, to the Western Caribean, and all over the western US, and of all of the pictures I have, I don't see a true need for a higher megapixel than 3 MP (mine is 2 MP) or zoom (3x), unless you need a camera for your profession.", "Date": "January 26, 2004"}, {"Title": "Great camera!", "Author": "Mark L.

Second, the information I am providing has been gathered based on a comparison and my experience with other camera's in its field, more noteably the Fuji Finepix A310, Nikon Coolpix 3100, and lesser models such as the Fuji Finepix 2650 and Nikon Coolpix 2100. To begin this camera has a wealth of features that other cameras do not, so if you are starting out on a digicam it has auto mode and if your a pro or trying to be one, then your all set in that department as well.A few readers mentioned that it takes bad pictures in the dark or low-light conditions.  I would be interested to know what setting they used to take those pictures because I have gotten perfect pictures, sometimes better than with good lighting.  In a few scenarios, I have chosen to use no lights rather than use lights for the photograph.In addition to being able to take pictures in both low and high lighting pictures, the Canon A70 produces very, very little image noise, only a few red eye images (which can be edited on a computer) and out of approximatley 100 photos that are taken produced only 3 unfocused pictures.

Slightly more than a year ago I bought a Canon PowerShot A70, having read many excellent reviews of it and having compared it with other 3MP cameras then on the market. Until a few days ago (when its warranty had lapsed by several weeks) the camera was a joy; all the good things said about it in its many reviews had proven true. But then, one afternoon, out of the blue, an 'E18!' error: the camera's optical unit failed, the lens would not retract, and the camera became completely nonfunctional. To no avail I tried the few remedies suggested by Canon tech support on line, by e-mail, and over the phone (where responses were quick, courteous, but completely ineffectual). The telephone tech rep then informed me that I could send the camera, at my expense, to Canon, who would repair it for anywhere from $100 to $200. I asked him if lens-unit failure was a common problem with the camera (already, from the dozens of reports I'd read on the web, I knew it was), and, quite candidly, he replied that it was. He added that this was true with ALL PowerShot 'A' series cameras, so that I could not buy a subsequent model (e.g., A75 or A80) with any confidence that the 'E18' problem would not occur with it. Please read the negative reviews of this camera and consider that the problems described may affect your camera (and those of the rave review writers) several weeks or months into ownership.

I really didn't know if I would enjoy digital or not so it wouldn't be much of a writeoff if I decided to stick with film. In fact, I've been a die-hard Nikon user but couldn't find an offering from Nikon that compared to the Canon A70.I've had the A70 for a few weeks and taken several hundred photos. During that period I haven't picked up any of my film cameras.Although it's only been a short time, I'm finding digital to be a revelation. The instant feedback I get on the LCD screen means that I don't have to worry about whether or not I \"got the shot\".Pros:Available manual metering with ability to customize flash outputSharp lensSeems pretty sturdy for a plasticam (it's not all metal as the ads would lead you to believe)Takes AA batteries...4 of 'em! I'm using 2000ma Powerex NIMH batteries and would recommend them to anyone.Cons:In any of the auto modes, the flash is a little too powerful for subjects within 8 feet.Hunts for focus in low-light situations. So does my Nikon N80 so that's not just Canon's problemCheap 16mb CF card. I bought a 256mb SanDisk with the camera and would recommend that you do too.Software is suitable for only simple tasks. The red eye remover is a joke. I'm ordering Adobe Elements 2.0 from Amazon today.Overall, I'm still learning about digital photography but find it very enjoyable and relatively simple. I'm sure that my film photography experience helps with the last part but the A70 is really a point and shoot camera even though I don't use it that way.I can't imagine a better camera for the money. I'm considering the purchase of a digital SLR which will probably be a Nikon so that I can use my current lenses. If I were starting from scratch I could just as easily go with a Canon.EDITED: Coming up on 1 year of ownership, I'm still generally satisfied with the quality of the camera. No problems whatsoever so maybe I'm lucky.Prints up to 8.5x11 are acceptable but barely so. I've found that almost every image needs some correction in PhotoShop to looks its best but I understand that every other digital camera requires the same.Frankly, I'm not all that impressed with the whole digital thing. While I can understand the convenience factor when taking the shot, the post processing of every image defeats the purpose. I've been holding off buying a DSLR until I see a large improvement in this area.Right now I find that I can get better quality by simply scanning the slides taken with my Nikon film cameras.

It resembles the Olympus XA that so many of us loved in the past.I am writing this because the strong points of this camera are not easy to spot from the material aimed at the amateur market.1. I can use the same cards as with my G3, which is my official travel camera (I am also a writer, so no SLR's for me, thank you). I can just switch the card from camera to camera and download material any which way. This might work with the SLR's, too, but I haven't tried.2. The picture quality at ISO 50 is actually quite usable, at least in a tabloid. At first look it is difficult to tell it apart from G3. Don't crop, though. The other ISO's have massive noise, but I use them anyway in special situations.3. The wideangle add-on lens is no Summicron, but it is passable and very small. I have both the A70 and the wide tucked in the corners of my minuscule bag, so in case of a catastrophe, I still have a 24-105 mm camera to work with.4. The waterproof case is a marvel. ... Okay, it is not a Nikonos, but it is a small, lightweight thing that gives me the option of taking splashy pictures on the go.5. Then there are the obvious advantages: AA/Nimh batteries, tv/av/manual modes, single-point and manual focusing and other normal Canon stuff.The disadvantages are naturally enormous from the professional point of view, but we are talking back-up here.The competition is surprisingly scarce. First I gravitated towards the S50, but it has several shortcomings. No wideangle, no AA batteries and non-pocketable size. It doesn't support a proper flash any more than the A70. What's the use of having better resolution, if the camera is not in your pocket/the battery is dead in Ouagadougou/the shot calls for a wide perspective? Don't know about you, but I use 35 mm for shooting official state buildings, and not much else.The Elph/Ixus-series is a lot worse. Sure, they feel better and are a couple of millimeters smaller, but they are hopelessly tyroesque.If there are more options, I haven't found them.

Canon has thought of everything when it comes to making their products user-friendly. I have messed around with a lot of digital cameras recently and most of the non-Canons have not yet mastered camera ergonomics. Many manufacturers are trying to make their camera super small, which I admit, can be nice sometimes. But in doing so, they've thrown ergonomics out the window, so using the more advanced features is very frustrating. You have to have sharp fingernails to press some of the buttons on other cameras. But with the Canon A70, fingertips work fine. The camera is shaped so that your right hand fits perfectly around the body without obstructing the lens or mashing unwanted buttons. I don't need to list all the features here, as they are listed in several other reviews. But one neat feature(some people think it's a negative) is that it takes four AA batteries instead of a battery pack. The real trick is to buy two four-packs of either the Rayovac or Energizer rechargeable NiMh batteries and a charger. Instead of spending 80 bucks on an extra battery pack, you spend 15 bucks on a charger and 12 bucks per 4-pack of AAs. Plus, when your friends are scrambling for a wall-outlet to charge their camera battery packs, you just drop in the other set of AAs and shoot away. It has been an invaluable asset when I'm shooting in the field away from AC power. The software that is bundled with the camera is almost limitless. The \"Photo-stitch assist\" mode of the camera is really cool. It helps you line up subsequent pictures for a panoramic, so when you bring the pics into the computer software, it does an amazing job at making a panoramic image!

Unfortunately, this is not something over which Canon has any control.  We are able only to confirm the performance of the camera based on our own testing.  Canon USA has not released any service notifications regarding an issuewith the LCD screen.  Since the camera is more than one year old, it is out of warranty.  We have two options available: you may send the camera in for repair, or you may participate in our PowerShot Upgrade program.  The standard labor cost to make the repair will range from $100 to $200. Parts may be an additional cost.  Cameras damaged by impact, liquid, or sand may have a considerably higher repair cost, depending on theresults of the Factory Service Center's evaluation.So even though this has happened to many people and on many websites there are similar complaints about this model, Canon won't take responsibility.  If you've experienced problems, I suggest you call them.  A better suggestion, don't buy Canon products.  The repair and upgrade program they refer to are both jokes.  $100-$200 to repair a camera that now costs $180?

Has manual overide capability if you want, so you can take total control of your shots.  The 15 fps movie mode with sound is awesome.  The camera can take a 640X480 movie clip of 3 minutes in length and produces about a 20MB file.  Of course you can take many of these 3 minute clips as long as you have space on your CompactFlash card.  320X240 movie clip lengths are only limited by the amount of free space on your memory card.

I purchased a larger memory card (128MB) and rechargeable batteries, and have really enjoyed using the camera for six moths without any problems.  You can also purchase additional lenses (which is nice, because it has a limited zoom).  We have packed away our Nikon and camcorder, because this is less obstrusive, more convenient, and simpler to use.  Pictures which we've developed at WalMart have also come out clean and crisp, although we've never done a larger size than 4x6.

Also, the pictures in general show noticeable noise in the shadow areas (something not seen on the A40 and easy to see once you know what to look for) and are soft focused. Post processing can help but this camera should have offered a sharper focus setting. Colour is though generally faithful and the A70 has a slightly wider dynamic (contrast) range than the A40. But the crispness of the image is lacking. Landscapes show smeared detail and I have seen a published shot where there is a smeared area in the middle of the picture - a similar problem that I had on the A40. Purple fringing is not a general problem except against bright sky near the edges of the picture. Redeye in flash pictures remains a problem and the AF assist light in dark areas remains useless. The manual focus is therefore a useful improvement but not quick to use and difficult to judge in the dark. Overall, this could have been a brilliant camera if the focus, noise factor and anti-redeye system had been managed better.

I had to go searching through many cameras and finally decided upon this one after reading the reviews here on Amazon and then checking it out at the store where I purchased it.It is amazingly simple to use the first time around.  By just turning it on and playing with it, you can figure out just about all the basics right away, which is why I say it is an awesome camera to have for a beginner (which is how I classify myself).  It comes with so many features that at first I didn't think were really necessary, but now I feel I could not live without them.  Every picture that I have taken has come out perfectly, which is saying a lot because I go off roading all the time and you get to see some of the most beautiful animals in their natural habitat, but you have to be quick to take the pictures of some of them which is why the \"moving\" feature is awesome and other times the animals are far away which is why the zoom is great!  It does well even in poor lighting and at night.  This camera is very easy to hook up to my Mac but unfortunately is not that compatible with the iPhoto program, but that is okay because the program that it comes with is very easy to use!!

In a nutshell, I'd simply say if you want a digital camera that point and shoot, the A-70 can't be beat for under $ 300 --- probably not for a lot more dollars, either.I have a huge old Sony Mavica FD-91 that has been a good, reliable workhorse.  I like Sony in general, and looked at several new models before coming across the Canon A-70.I started to buy one at Amazon.com, but then I saw it was coming from Target (no free shipping!), so I said what the heck, I'll just go there and get one.  No luck, they were out, and could not say when they would get more.  Circuit City and Best Buy had the same story.Back to the internet, and found a lot of the camera suppliers were also out. So back to good old Amazon.com.  When I did the deal, their supplier had changed to Office Depot, but they had some in stock and I got mine in just a few days, for about $ 8.00 shipping.Canon has a nice package, including the camera, USB cable, a cable for hooking the camera up to a TV, four AA batteries, a stingy 16MB compact flash card, software, and about four pounds of manuals. I found the manuals to be nicely done, better than what I'm used to from Sony by far.The camera is just jam-up.  For most of us, just leave it in \"auto\" and start shooting.  For shutterbugs, it has a number of features that will allow special settings. It operates on four AA batteries, no high dollar jobs like many other cameras use.  I invested in rechargeable 1800 mAh Nickel Metal Hydrides, having been forewarned by other reviewers. I also stuck in a 512 MB card so I won't have to screw around changing them, or at least not very often.I think the A-70 is a great design --- the battery box forms a natural grip for right handers.  The optical view finder is far enough left so that if you use your right eye, you nose won't get the back of the camera greasy. No lens cap, it has an automatic eyelid, sort of. Only a 3-X zoom, but c'mon, we're talking a $ 299.00 3.2 Megapixel camera here! The \"feel\" is good and solid. The little LCD on the back is sharp and clear, and there are a minimum of buttons to deal with --- what is there is easy to use.So, if you are a first time digital camera buyer, this would be the one I'd recommend.  It is small enough for a purse, or to slip into a trouser pocket, so it will go anywhere with minimal fuss. It's cheap, takes great pictures --- even videos if you want --- what's not to like?", "Date": "August 29, 2003"}, {"Title": "I get some pretty amazing photos, and love those closeups!", "Author": "S. Brand \"sandra807\"", "ReviewID": "R3JFEKNYTFBBGO", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I have had this camera for several months now.  I bought it in particular to take photos of the jewelry I design and sell on the internet.  As I'm not a photography pro, I needed something easy to use and that could take good quality closeups.  I also wanted something I could afford on a tight budget.  If I could compare this camera to a car, I would compare it to my Toyota Corolla... both are comfortable to use, reliable, sturdy, and fantastic quality for a reasonable price.I read the booklet to learn how to use the manual controls of the camera, and it helped tremendously to be able to adjust the amount of light I let in as I photograph my jewelry within a few inches, inside my house near a window.  I turn off the flash so as not to have a glare or washed out colors, and it's amazing with just a little adjustment on the camera, how I can get a natural looking light on my subject, as well as fine detail.  When taking closeups, you just press the closeup button so that it can focus on objects within a few inches.  A little square appears on the screen to show you exactly what it's focusing on.  (...)As for \"regular\" photography of people and places outdoors, for example, I have gotten amazingly beautiful shots of scenery that look like they should be in a magazine, and others that of course are ho-hum.  The great thing though, as with digital cameras, is that I can take several shots and choose the best ones to keep.Now, I have to admit that I also use Photoshop Elements with many of my photos, and the combination of the camera and the editing program makes for some pretty professional looking photos!  With Elements, I can crop, add contrast, adjust color, brightness, and sharpness, so that even not-so-great photos can come out pretty amazing.The weight and feel of the CanonA70 is just right.  It's not heavy, and rests comfortably in the hand.  I don't feel like I'm going to accidentally crush it as I would with an ultra-slim camera.  I love the self-closing lens and the fact that I don't have a detachable lens cap that could get lost.

I have taken some really nice pictures.  But one qualification: It does have a significant problem with \"purple fringing\": a very bright patch next to a very dark patch in your picture will sometimes have a purple halo around it.  I know this is common in cameras with higher pixel counts, but I don't know how this camera compares to similarly priced models.  It can usually be removed with a time consuming procedure in Photoshop, etc.  This problem could apparently be solved if the A70 used a better interpolation technique in the camera.They say the problem can be dimished by using a longer focal length (zooming in) or a lower ISO, but even this does not always work.  But to be honest, the movie mode is so awesome (better than anything else out there for the price), that I am willing to put up with this problem.BTW, I also recommend \"Complete Digital Photography\" by Ben Long if you want to know how digital cameras work, how to take better pictures, and even how to choose the right camera.And the movie mode is awesome at VGA resolution--shown on my 19\" TV, it looks a lot like a really good super-8 movie.

Even though the body is plastic, it has a sturdy feel to it unlike some other cameras in this price range. Once it's in your hands, you pop in the 4 AA batteries, the compact flash card and, away you go. Put it in AUTO mode and you have a nice 3MP point and shoot camera that responds very well to varying light conditions and circumstances. In other modes you have control over; white balance, exposure compensation, Drive (Single shot, continuous shooting, self-timer), ISO speed, Light Metering, Image Quality and Photo Effect (Off, vivid color, neutral color, low sharpening, sepia, black & white) The other modes are: P-this mode is the same as AUTO but you have control over the above mentioned options. Av-Aperture Priority, you set the f-stop, the camera sets the shutter speed. Tv-Shutter Priority, you set the shutter speed, the camera sets the f-stop M-full manual, you have control over shutter speed, aperture, flash output, and focus. In addition to that, there's six other modes; Slow Shutter, Fast Shutter, Landscape, Night Scene and, Portrait. In these modes, the camera sets shutter and aperture to the appropriate settings for each situation. Also included is a Stitch mode which lets you take a series of photos and then combine with the software for a panoramic effect.The last mode on the camera is Movie Mode. In Movie Mode, you can record at 3 resolutions; 640 X 480, 320 x 240, and 160 x 120. In the largest format you can record for 30 seconds and, in the other two formats, you can record approx. 3 minutes. Movies are recorded with sound in the AVI format but unfortunately, you can not use the zoom while filming in this mode. Performance When you power the camera up, it takes about 3 seconds to warm up before it's ready to shoot. Once it's ready, you push the shutter down halfway to lock the autofocus and then depress the shutter fully. Now you have a pic! You can review it on the LCD if you want any where from 2 to 10 seconds. The LCD screen measures 1.5 inches and fairly clear and easy to see but it would have been nice to control the brightness.Next move inside to take some flash pictures. Here you'll use the autofocus illuminator to help the camera focus in low light. There's a small orange light on the front of the camera under the flash, when you focus, it comes on to make it easier for the camera to focus. This eliminates the long focus times that some other camera have in these situations if they can even focus at all. Also inside, you'll appreciate the fact that Canon put a decent flash on this little guy. It has a working distance of about 13 feet at the wide angle setting.Picture Quality is very good. Pictures come out sharp with accurate color tones. I do get red-eye sometimes in indoor shots but, not always and, not to the point that I would consider unacceptable.

Being anal I decided to do some serious research before choosing one. I decided to stick to 3 mp because Im dreaming of getting a digital SLR down the road and didnt want to sink too much money into this. It seemed that everywhere I checked every serious reviewer raved about this camera. What finally sold me on it was the fact that it had a lot of advance features that would allow me to tweak my photos (aperture priority, etc..), movies with sound, autofocus assist for low light situations, and would still be simple enough for my wife to snap shots of the kids quickly. All I can say is WOW! I didn't even have to crack open the manual for the first 2 days.

Buyers should be aware that the battery life on this camera is EXCELLENT! If you're put off by the idea of having to buy AA batteries get yourself 8 rechargeables. You'll always have a spare set charged up. And if you're ever traveling and run out its easy enough to get regular AA's anywhere. Try that with a proprietary battery. For those of you worried about the 3 megapixel just keep one thing in mind...It will only be a problem if you try to blow it up larger than 8x10. How many of you have ever felt the need to do that?I mentioned the ability to tweak earlier. I'm happy. You get most of the options  that you normally have to buy an SLR in a compact camera size. All you semi-serious photo people should seriously consider this just for that reason. Many of the other digital point and shoots are just too dumb and would have frustrated me. OK...one problem is red eye. But I knew that going in just b/c of how physically close the flash is to the lens. But that's what photo software is for.

We use these to create training aids and to document problems and/or unusual situations.  Since then, I've recommended this camera to 4 of my friends, and they are all quite satisfied with the A70s performance.There are better digicams out there, but for the price, the A70 cannot be beat.  The A70s are fairly user-friendly.  There are many technologically impaired people at my workplace, and I've managed to train them on the most basic features of this camera with little effort.  And for those who require more advanced features (f/stop, shutter speed, exposure compensation,...), the A70 will provide satisfaction (although some of these features are buried deep in menus).The A70s size is compact, though not quite as small as many of the super-compact digicams (Canon ELPH, Pentax Optio, Casio Exilim, Olympus Stylus,...).  But for those with larger hands, the A70 is very easy to handle.  When I am using a super-compact digicam, I often feel as if it will slip out of my fingers.  The larger grip of the A70, however, provides a wonderful sense of security.The biggest gripe I have with this camera is the lack of a RAW or TIFF mode.  Granted, most users won't use these formats, but some of the more advanced users may appreciate them.We've printed pictures up to 8x10 inches with pretty decent results.  Most point and shooters will find the A70 to more than adequately suit their needs (when was the last time you had an 8x10 made?).If you do get the A70, definitely invest in a larger CompactFlash card (consider 128MB).  And don't forget to purchase a couple sets of rechargeable NiMH AA batteries and a recharger.If you think you need higher resolution, the recently released 4MP Canon A80 may suit your needs.  The A80 also comes with a swiveling LCD, which is quite helpful in taking self-portraits or shooting from an unusual angle (it also makes an excellent real-time \"reverse-mirror\").", "Date": "March 10, 2004"}, {"Title": "Poor Quality Control?", "Author": "Jeff K \"tnqgzs11\"", "ReviewID": "R2DKONBFS67THQ", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "My first A70 did a very nice job for a few weeks until it failed without warning.

Canon fixes this problem at no charge and even pays for shipping. However, in two years of owning this camera, I've had to return it twice for this repair.2.

It's easy to operate and use the camera's functions, and the results are very good. Color balance is good for all white balance settings, especially incandescent when shooing in incandescent light. Pictures are sharp and free from image artifacts.One minor annoyance is that the zoom is electronic. It is difficult to get the exact zoom you want, especially for normal (the human eye's perspective). Another annoyance is the camera's widest aperature. It is not wide enough to make things n the background go out of focus. However, with a little skill with Photoshop, you can mask the subject and perform blurring.Connecting and downloading images to your computer is easy and painless. The supplied software is adequate but not stellar.A nice featuer is that the camera uses AA sized batteries.

The editing software that comes with the camera is very easy to use.  The panorma feature (or photo stitch I think it's called) gave us some great scenery shots and the \"auto pilot\" feature allowed us to both be in the picture at the same time.

At first it was no match to my trusty 35mm, but then I switched the setting to capture the highest quality pictures, and have had no complaints since then.In the beginning it was hard to get used to the delay in shutter speed - I was used to \"snap and click\", but with the powershot I had to hold down the button for maybe a second or so before the picture would take.

As I worked more I played around with it more, and before I knew it I had decided which camera I would purchase when eventually purchased a camera.  The first thing you will notice about the A70 is how comfortable the camera feels while holding it.  The camera is extremely easy to turn on, and selecting one of the 12 different shooting modes is perfectly placed for your thumb.  The zoom is more than enough for me at 3.2 digital and 3X optical.  Taking/viewing pictures is as easy as any other camera I have ever seen, and the battery life is what is excpected from 4 alkaline AAs(I havent used Rechargable batteries yet).  There is no lens cover to worry about because there is a shutter that comes over the lens when you turn the power off.  The software that come with the camera is above expectations so far, but I have not used it incredibly extensively yet.  The Canon A70 does have a movie mode, and it works fine for short clips.  I also have the Canon ZR45 so I do not use the movie mode on the A70 that much.  Everything you need to get started come with the camera, including a strap and a 16mb Campactflash memory card.  Another nice thing about the camera is that it takes the CF card.  They are by far the easiest to find and cost far less than a number of other memory cards.

My review is strictly my opinion on using the A70, since I have never used any other brand, so I don't know if other may behave similarly or not.First the good things: The A70 produces excellent color images, both on the monitor/tv or printed. It uses the least expensive memory card - compact flash.  It uses the least expensive AA size batteries. (I bought 8 rechargeable ones, still very inexpensive compared to those batteries used in some very small tiny digital camera).  Direct hookup to tv for viewing without the need of a dock.Now the negatives:  It bothers me very much that what you see in the viewfinder is not what you get.  The little 1.5 inch screen seems to show what you will really get, but not the viewfinder.  Under bright sunlight, the little screen is totally useless, you cannot see a thing.  And since using the viewfinder does not correctly show you what you'll get, it's very frustrating to have to guess.  Also because of the little screen becomes totally useless under bright sunlight, it is extremely hard to make any setting changes since settings are only displayed on the little screen, not through the viewfinder.  For example, if you need to change from flash-on to flash-off under bright sunlight, good luck.  The second annoying thing is the zoom control.  It is almost impossible to zoom precisely.  You'll go too far one way and when you zoom back, you'll go too far the other way.  No precision control on the zooming mechanism.  It is fine with casual snapshot type of pictures, but not when you want a little bit of artistic creation.  Third annoying thing is the delay reaction on the shutter, which I have read on other brands also, so it is not a unique A70 issue, but that does not make it not annoying.

After a couple of years with the camera and several thousand exposures, some observations:- Optical viewfinder is junk - but this seems to be common in cameras of this price range. Shows only about 70% of view, and mine is also off about 10 degrees in rotation.- Picture quality is excellent as long as the \"ASA\" is kept on Auto or at or below 100. \"Auto ASA\" will net shutter/apertures at ASA 50 equivalent. At ASA 200 and 400, there is lots of noise and the camera will overexpose pictures taken in daylight.- Picture quality as \"high ASA\" speeds (200,400) has deteriorated over time. Beware if you are buying used. Pictures taken in low light are filled with noise, streaks, and \"sparkles\".- Power management is poor. Batteries die without warning (I've never seen the \"low battery\" indication), and camera has gotten \"stuck\" a couple of times in a mode where it seems to think even fresh batteries are no good; it has recovered after a few minutes with the batteries removed. Can take about 120 no-flash pictures on a set of 2000 maH NiMhs, with LCD mostly on. Battery life on alkalines is shorter than high-capacity NiMh's.- Autofocus has failed on about 1% of pictures.", "Date": "May 27, 2004"}, {"Title": "An excellent Camera", "Author": "Nick R.", "ReviewID": "R44BLGVU08NUB", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I've owned this camera for 2 days, and already I've had a blast with it. I previously co-owned an Olympus D-550, but decided to buy a second one just for me.  It has great battery life (well, for a digital camera at least).  The pictures come out very good, and it has very nice optics (interchangeable lenses [not included] which is a nice feature).  It also uses compact flash, which is way better than smart media.  It's very cheap and you can get up to 256MB of storage space for this camera.The only real con is that it doesnt support uncompressed images (like TIFF files).  That is really something I would've liked to have, although the jpeg superfine compression it uses is practically lossless. Another small quirk is that there is no battery meter.  It only tells you when you are about to run out (maybe 5 minutes of life left?). But it lasts so long, you really don't have to worry about it.There was one other thing that bothered me, but was not actually a problem, was how the picture on the LCD got lines through it when zooming.  The lines disappear when you stop.  At first I thought this was an issue with the LCD, as it looked suspicious. But not to worry, according to a Canon technician this is normal.It is neither annoying nor do the lines interfering with viewing your subject.  However new owners might think there is something wrong with their camera. Good quality batteries helps alleviate this problem. As with all non professional digital camera's, the autofocus/auto shooting mode doesn't always work correctly... This model works extremely well, but of course is not perfect. But one should keep in mind that for 300$ this is by far superior to almost others out there under 500$.  Autofocusing by most digital camera's are distracted by anything that emits glare or is very shiny/light reflective.  The canon can be fooled, but it generally works even under tricky conditions.  But of course Canon gives you a very complete set of manual features to adjust for these conditions. Most of the time this is not needed... I find it hard to match the \"auto\" mode quality with my own settings, a very big positive.The ergonomics are also wonderful, it's very comfortable to hold and unlike other cameras you don't feel like you are going to drop it.  Although I have mostly listed some negative things about this camera, this is no where near a bad review. The camera is wonderful, and the best 3-4 MP camera you can buy IMO. The clarity of the pictures and their color is wonderful.  I really don't see how anyone could be disappointed with this camera.

Even though the body is plastic, it has a sturdy feel to it unlike some other cameras in this price range. Once it's in your hands, you pop in the 4 AA batteries, the compact flash card and, away you go. Put it in AUTO mode and you have a nice 3MP point and shoot camera that responds very well to varying light conditions and circumstances. In other modes you have control over; white balance, exposure compensation, Drive (Single shot, continuous shooting, self-timer), ISO speed, Light Metering, Image Quality and Photo Effect (Off, vivid color, neutral color, low sharpening, sepia, black & white) The other modes are: P-this mode is the same as AUTO but you have control over the above mentioned options. Av-Aperture Priority, you set the f-stop, the camera sets the shutter speed. Tv-Shutter Priority, you set the shutter speed, the camera sets the f-stop M-full manual, you have control over shutter speed, aperture, flash output, and focus. In addition to that, there's six other modes; Slow Shutter, Fast Shutter, Landscape, Night Scene and, Portrait. In these modes, the camera sets shutter and aperture to the appropriate settings for each situation. Also included is a Stitch mode which lets you take a series of photos and then combine with the software for a panoramic effect.The last mode on the camera is Movie Mode. In Movie Mode, you can record at 3 resolutions; 640 X 480, 320 x 240, and 160 x 120. In the largest format you can record for 30 seconds and, in the other two formats, you can record approx. 3 minutes. Movies are recorded with sound in the AVI format but unfortunately, you can not use the zoom while filming in this mode. Performance When you power the camera up, it takes about 3 seconds to warm up before it's ready to shoot. Once it's ready, you push the shutter down halfway to lock the autofocus and then depress the shutter fully. Now you have a pic! You can review it on the LCD if you want any where from 2 to 10 seconds. The LCD screen measures 1.5 inches and fairly clear and easy to see but it would have been nice to control the brightness.Next move inside to take some flash pictures. Here you'll use the autofocus illuminator to help the camera focus in low light. There's a small orange light on the front of the camera under the flash, when you focus, it comes on to make it easier for the camera to focus. This eliminates the long focus times that some other camera have in these situations if they can even focus at all. Also inside, you'll appreciate the fact that Canon put a decent flash on this little guy. It has a working distance of about 13 feet at the wide angle setting.Picture Quality is very good. Pictures come out sharp with accurate color tones. I do get red-eye sometimes in indoor shots but, not always and, not to the point that I would consider unacceptable. I have yet to have any incidences of \"purple fringing\" Software, etc. Canon supplies you with two software applications. One their own and the other is ArcSoft's. Both applications are good for basic image editing but, if you want something more you'll likely pick up Photoshop.Downloading photo's is pretty straight forward once the software is installed. Hook up the computer with the supplied cable to a USB port, turn it on and your computer (PC) will either open the appropriate program or, you'll have to. Once the program is open, pick the images you want and, hit File, Transfer. That's about it. You can also view images, and movies on a TV with the supplied cable.The only other things in the box (aside from the manual) are a 16MB Compact Flash card and, 4 AA batteries. In the highest resolution, you'll get 8 pictures on this card so, you'll probably want to purchase another one soon. The 4AA batteries will last about 100 pics so, consider purchasing some high capacity rechargeables also. The batteries and the CF card will set you back [some $$] but, you'll thank yourself later.

This camera is definitely designed for the masses and it shows because it sells out as soon as it hits a store shelf. I was lucky enough to get after searching for over a week.

I love taking closeups of my daughter and Canon offers 12 modes in all including a closeup potrait mode which is very useful. I am quite happy with this camera as it offers manual control along with the usual Canon features and it is easy to create some special effects. I am just learning photography and this camera has a great price with good features for this purpose. The software is easy to use and if you have Windows XP it downloads the images through the scanner and camera wizard even if you dont wan't to use the software that comes with the camera. I have used the photostich software the most which is quite easy to use, and took some great pictures with it. The image and video software is also quite easy to use and gives good results.The only drawback to me was that this camera is not as small as the ELPH series and I have to carry it in my handbag instead of my pocket to avoid creating an ugly bulge. But it is still small enough to whip it out quickly and take shots. ...Update after 6 months, Oct 2003:For the price and the features this camera is still hard to beat. I still maintain my opinion above after taking about 2500 photographs. This camera has been tested to have the greatest number of shots from the 4AA batteries it uses. And I usually am able to take anywhere between 350-500 pictures with one set of rechargaeable Ni-MH batteries. I have used the sepia tones in the special effects to take some very special pics and many landscapes with the photostitch software. The full manual controls for this price is a good deal and I have been happy playing the rookie photographer. If you just want to point and shoot you probably do not need the features on this camera and you can go in for lighter versions, but if you want to be a little creative its a cheap first camera to have which lets you play around with different modes and manual controls. The movie mode is quite good too and with a larger memory Compact Flash card you can make respectable clips to send off to your friends.The only small complaints I have are that there is a time lag between when you press the button to when the picture gets taken and its hard to take action shots. But this is a feature of all Canon digital and film cameras and if you have used one you know what I am talking about. The other problem is that sometimes the Autofocus does not give as good pictures as my Canon 35mm film camera - Powershot used to give.

I personally took a chance with the whole E18 error and have not had it happen to me yet.  However even the sales folks at the local electronics store knew about the error and were looking forward to the A80 not having the same thing happen to it.  Let's hope so...but there are other issues out there with this camera.  The main one is for those of us out there that will be using AA batteries and rechargeable batteries.  It seems as though the A70 is a bit picky when it comes to changing out the batteries.  You can put in 4 brand new cells (all from the same brand) and the camera will reject the new batteries.  The message that is presented is \"change battery pack\".  By playing musical chairs with the batteries it will work after some dancing.  But this should not be necessary.So that is the negative stuff.  Here is the positive stuff that you will really enjoy to read.  We purchased the camera in September from Ritz.com off of this site.  You may read some reviews stating that the camera is heavy due to the batteries.  This may be true.  4 AA batteries can be heavy.  However the batteries are situated where the palm of your hand will be gripping the camera.  This provides a great feel for the product that feels like quite a bit of thought went into it.  The pictures will be bragged about it the other hundreds of reviews for the A60, 70 and 80 models so I will just concur with them stating that they are all subjective.  The functions on the camera are as intuitive to operate as say a Sony product who is usually the leader in this area.  Not to say that the Sony line is inferior but just to say that this would be a complimentary statment to Canon.  Oh and yes I nearly forgot.  The software that comes with this camera is really top notch considering what it can do.  It is so user friendly and makes you feel like you got everything under control with how to download and then email each image.

The first one was the fact that Compact Flash cards are far cheaper and more popular than Sony's Memory Stick. I bought a 128mp card for $24.99, a fraction of the price I would have paid for a similar card for any Sony camera! The second thing was the fact that this Canon uses simple and easy to find AA batteries, which means that if my camera ever runs out of power (and I'm caught without a spare set of rechargeables) I can easily find batteries for it at any place!I love the many features of this little camera, and believe me, it has lots of them! One other thing that I really like about it is that you can use it both as a completely automatic point and shoot camera or as a completely manual one!

I used to take film pictures and got quite practiced at it, so this camera really annoys me because it refuses to behave like a standardized photographic instrument -- that is, when you point the lens at something and have it dead center in the frame, the lens is supposed to look for edges on that dead-center object and calculate focus accordingly.This piece of \"equipment,\" however, has a mind of its own, so you wind up with lovely background foliage and a muddy blur of color in the middle where a sharp image of a bloom should be.In short, if your photography makes any sort of technical demands and requires a sharp instrument to assist, Buy Something Else.If all you're looking for is a good snappy camera to take pictures of groups of friends or wide vistas, this camera will probably be fine.", "Date": "September 19, 2006"}, {"Title": "DO NOT BUY", "Author": "Sherry Berry", "ReviewID": "R772X3ML4ENSR", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "My sister and I both have A70's, and in one year, they've started to exhibit the purple-black hazy line problem.

I don't understand the people at Canon.  I had a PowerShot s30 - an excellent camera, with virtually the same features as the A70, but small enough to fit into your pocket - but my s30 was stolen and I was forced to buy the A70 because the s30 was discontinued.  The A70 takes just as good pics as the s30, and it has almost the same features, BUT it's substantially bigger and it takes four clunky, heavy AA batteries rather than a small rechargable one half the size of an average matchbox.  I just don't get it.  With the S30, you had a great manual camera that was small enough to fit into your pocket and that was reasonably priced.  Now, Canon forces you to choose between a manual large camera, and a non-manual pocket-sized one.  Why can't they just revive the great features of the S30?  My advice:  If you want a high quality, low-priced digital camera with manual features, and don't mind a large and heavy one, get the A70 or eqivalent new model.  If you want any other mix of features, try something else.", "Date": "May 25, 2004"}, {"Title": "Not happy", "Author": null, "ReviewID": "R3LJPO3D98BRXG", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "Camera suffers E 18 error -- service department were very unhelpful", "Date": "March 2, 2004"}, {"Title": "It work great on my vac", "Author": null, "ReviewID": "R2IPXYANWMQAI2", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Using this camera was great on my vac.

The resolution is WORSE than my old film camera - a very inexpensive point-and-shoot - and it is very frustrating to use for several reasons:  1) the shutter does not go when you push the button - there is a several second delay - not a big deal with inanimate objects, but very difficult to photgraph people without getting funny expressions, and nearly impossible to photograph the baby without a lot of trial and error; and 2) the flash takes a LONG time to recharge, so after getting a funny expression in your first photo due to the shutter delay, you have to wait and wait and wait to try again - trust me, this gets really, really, really annoying very quickly.
