Gloria", "ReviewID": "R995LBH05LL1P", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "The camera's great, probably one of  the best I've ever purchased, but the bundled add-ons are of poor quality. The extra battery that came with the unit is bricked and not charging anymore. The float strap plastic connectors are cracked, and doesn't really go well with the camera. I would strongly advice the camera be purchased as a single unit--you'll do better getting an extra battery from a good supplier....", "Date": "October 1, 2013"}, {"Title": "Awesome deal", "Author": "Alex", "ReviewID": "RDHL76EGLBJ6E", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Great  camera,  great  bundle. Although I haven't had time to put camera through its paces,  it looks and feels well built and heavy duty.  Digital microscope mode is badass  and allows you to get way closer than needed.  Easy to use and hold. Fantastic bundle at a crazy price.  Thanks  to the  seller, Cameta Camera  for putting this together.", "Date": "June 28, 2013"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": "$294.95", "Features": "KIT INCLUDES 11 PRODUCTS -- All BRAND NEW Items with all Manufacturer-supplied Accessories + Full USA Warranties:\n<1> Pentax WG-3 Shock & Waterproof GPS Digital Camera (Green) + <2> Transcend 32GB Class10 SD Card +\n<3> Spare Li-50B/D-LI92 Battery + <4> Lowepro Rezo 50 Camera Case + <5> Floating Foam Camera Strap +\n<6> PD-T14 Flexible Camera Tripod + <7> PD 5pc Complete Cleaning Kit + <8> HDMI to Micro-HDMI Cable +\n<9> PD Memory Card Storage Wallet + <10> LCD Monitor Screen Protectors + <11> Image Recovery Software", "Name": "Pentax WG-3 Shock & Waterproof GPS Digital Camera (Green) with 32GB Card + Battery + Case + Flex Tripod + Float Strap + HDMI Cable + Accessory Kit", "ImgURL": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51DZ%2BjRb71L._SY300_.jpg", "ProductID": "B00C2CL6JI"}}
