Its a Polaroid.  It supposedly is a 9 mexa-pixel but the photos are absolutely terrible.  They are blurry and discolored no matter what setting.  On top of that the flash needs to recharge after each photo so you have to wait 5-10 seconds if you want to take two.  I received it for Christmas and was eager to use it right away.  It took such terrible photos that I ended up buying a disposable so we had pictures for the day. Terrible camera!!", "Date": "January 8, 2011"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": "$69.99", "Features": "9.0 megapixel resolution, 4x digital zoom and 2.5inch bright color LCD for previewing images before you shoot\nTakes video clips with audio in AVI format\nBuilt-in flash -Flash Modes, Fill-in mode, auto mode, flash OFF mode, red-eye reduction\nUses 2 AAA batteries\nIntegrated Memory 16 MB", "Name": "Polaroid A930 9.0 MP Digital Camera  with 2.5-Inch LCD Display (Magenta)", "ImgURL": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41IP9o04QyL._SX300_.jpg", "ProductID": "B0025VKVNI"}}
