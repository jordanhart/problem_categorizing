{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Manufacturing defect / worthless warranty", "Author": "Paul H. Anderson", "ReviewID": "RH9H6QTZHZM3J", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I bought this camera for my son about 10 months ago.  About 5 months ago, the camera developed black lines and dots on the rear monitor.  We sent it in to Nikon for repair under their warranty.  Instead, we got a notice saying Nikon wanted to charge us $105.46 to repair the camera.  I called and asked why.  They said the problem was cause by undue pressure on the camera, as if something heavy had been set on it.When we bought the camera, we also purchased a hard shell case.  The camera has only been lightly used.  When it was not being used, it was in the hard case.  It has never been placed under pressure.  Furthermore, of the 14 reviews on Amazon, 3 mention this same problem.  Ours would make it 4 out of 15, or 27% failure rate.  Clearly, this is a re-occurring manufacturing defect.Not only will Nikon not honor their warranty by trying to blame the customer, but they want to charge $105.46 to repair a camera that currently new costs only $134.66.Do not buy this camera or from Nikon.  This model has a high failure rate, as evidenced by the responses to Amazon.  Nikon will not stand by or honor their warranty if the camera does fail.  They will, as they did to me, blame the user for the problem.  Then they will charge you 80% of the cost of a new camera to fix it.  Surely there are other companies that are service and customer oriented.", "Date": "September 6, 2011"}, {"Title": "Nice For The Price", "Author": "MarcKirk \"SurfGramps\"", "ReviewID": "R2HKSJIEIBAOUP", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "This is a nice little camera a for sticking in your pocket when your DSLR is just too much to deal with. It is very small. The photos and HD video are very good, but not quite as good as a full size DSLR or HD video camera, but that is to be expected. There are not a lot of manual adjustments available, but you can change the photo characteristics by setting different \"scene types\". You'll need to read the manual to figure this out. For video, you cannot use zoom. This is a nice, reasonably priced camera, but if it's your only one, I would recommend considering spending a little more on say the S8000.", "Date": "January 9, 2011"}, {"Title": "LOVE IT!", "Author": "Lisa \"Nemesis\"", "ReviewID": "R3HMBVRBIKV7MT", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This camera takes WONDERFUL dusk and low light photos without flash!  The flash is very powerful and when used properly the photo's are crystal clear.  I love the color, and has a time delay for taking self portraits.  It's about as big as some of the smart phones that are out right now so it wasn't a pain in the rear to carry around while I was on vacation.  It takes great video too.  Be sure to buy a class 6 or above memory card to speed up the photo recording time.  I bought a 6 but really thing this requires a 10.", "Date": "January 1, 2011"}, {"Title": "Destroys Batteries after one charge", "Author": "Karan L.

This holds true for every battery I purchased.  I tried the batteries in my friends camera and they would not longer charge for her either.This has turned out to be a very expensive camera to operate.

It is very similar, even using the same battery. It takes great pictures. Set up and menu functions are easy to use. You can turn it on and take a picture in less than a second, if you do not have a welcome screen selected. Otherwise it takes a little longer. Video mode is accessed by touching the record button while in still picture mode, and begins recording in a little less than two seconds. From start up to video recording is about five seconds.

But, it also does VIDEO! It's a little awkward holding the camera like a camcorder but it does some really good HD video. I used my windows 7 'DVD maker' to put the .avi files together and it worked flawlessly!!! Great for making some home movies and for parties. We made some Christmas movies of us opening gifts and our little dog playing. Be sure to get a Class 6 sdhc card to go with it. You will need the speed of the class 6 memory card.

Just like the older model, this camera is easy to set up and use and the pictures are fabulous! I've only used the new one a couple of times, but am already very happy with it. I would definitely recommend to anyone looking for something they can just take out of the box and start using without much effort (once the battery is charged....) and get great results. Nice camera for the money.", "Date": "October 6, 2011"}, {"Title": "bad camera, disappointed", "Author": "sean", "ReviewID": "RA19W17ZX0DMF", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I have bought more than 12 cameras for friend and me. I tried canon, panasonic lumix, and kodak. I studied and enjoyed them. My daughter needs a small camera for her project. I told myself that I should try another brand - nikon this time. I compared several types and pick the nikon  coolpix S5100. After my daughter received this camera, it never produced a good image. the picture looks good in the screen of camera, but really bad in computer. After 5 months, the battery was \"exhausted\" and wouldn't take a charge. In my memory, nikon and canon are two of the best camera maker. I am disappointed to nikon's camera. I will not recommend nikon's camera.

Richmond \"old harp singer\"", "ReviewID": "RQ61T4XKTODWA", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I bought my Nikon Coolpix S5100 through Amazon and have been quite pleased with it. This review is focused on a very specific use of the camera - photomicrography.Recently I bought a Nikon Coolpix S5100 to replace my aging (5 years or so) Coolpix L1. I wanted a camera that would enable me to shoot photomicrographs through the eyepiece lens of an ordinary binocular microscope. Small-hospital pathologists often aren't allowed specialized cameras for photomicrography. The Coolpix doesn't produce publication quality photomicrographs, but they're good enough for hospital cancer conferences and the like.To set the Coolpix S5100 for photomicrography, use the close-up setting (with the flower logo), and set it to AF Area Mode (page 46 of the documentation). Rack the zoom lens out as far out as it will go. Turn the flash off.Use more illumination in the microscope than you need for ordinary use of the microscope. Press the front of the camera directly against the microscope's ocular, and move the camera until you see the microscopic image in the viewfinder. Then take the picture.You'll get better results at higher magnifications (including oil immersion), though the S5100 performs considerably better with lower power objectives than the L1 did.The jpg you get will be considerably vignetted and the color and contrast will be poor, and you will need to take the image to Photoshop Elements or a similar graphics editor to get an adequate image. Dimension the image at 1280 x 960 pixels for optimal display in PowerPoint.Put the PowerPoint presentation on a key drive (thumb drive, flash drive), take it to the conference, and plug it into the computer that operates the radiologists' PACS presentation.I didn't realize just how complicated this is until I tried to describe it!I've posted a couple of photomikes on my Flickr Web site atbobrichmond on Flickr.", "Date": "December 22, 2010"}, {"Title": "Useless Warranty", "Author": "Amazon Customer \"Bobby\"", "ReviewID": "R19S5IK8GX8WNZ", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "Two Months ago I selected this camera,because of its light weight, to take on vacation instead of my full frame digital Canon.
