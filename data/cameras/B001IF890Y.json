I needed a camera to cover my driveway and steps leading to my home.  The zoom feature allowed me to tailor the coverage area to exactly what was required. There are two adjustments a zoom and a focus that you have to work together to get a perfect image.  This camera allows you to put a text ID in the image and select its location on the image.  You can also set the shutter speed, brightness, back light compensation, AGC, white balance, mirror image, day or night mode, motion area, privacy areas of the screen can be blacked out, contrast, sharpness and color gain.  The controls are on the back of the camera to set it up so depending where you install the camera you may have to set it up before it is in its final location.  I use the default settings and they work just fine.  It comes with a 2 amp power supply and the specs do not state how much current it draws in the night mode with the IR on.  I feed the power to the camera with 18 gauge solid copper wire to limit the voltage drop which would dim the IR lights if a smaller power cable were used.  Color images are good and what I expected.  The IR images are good but not as good as the color.  I do not use the motion detection feature of the camera but use the one in the Mini DVR VideoSecu Mini Security CCTV DVR Recorder Motion Detection Overwrite Schedule Videos with Audio Recording 3UAwhich it works great with.Issues:  The only issue I had was very minor.  The template provided to drill the mounting holes for the camera mount was wrong.  Two of the holes were out of location.  So check it before you use it.  It is a pain if you are drilling in thick steel and they don't line up, ask me how I know.", "Date": "November 21, 2009"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": "$999.99", "Features": "High Resolution: 700 TVL.
