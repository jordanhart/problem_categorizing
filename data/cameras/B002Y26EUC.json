As with all Pelican products, build quality is excellent. I designed a custom retention system which consists of a length of tensioned webbing running along the back and 2 metal clips to securely and effortlessly strap it to my belt, and a \"mini wallet\" compartment - which is a folded piece of cardboard tucked in the front between the two foam spacers. I used the cardboard from my iPhone packaging, and centered the package's super cool metallic Apple logo in the viewing area over it's sleek black background.This case could be better if it had the mini wallet built in so I didn't have to add it, but I am perfectly satisfied with my solution. The headphone storage could also have used much more thought - if you just stuff your headphones in the bottom of the storage area, they will cause you grief by making it difficult to rapidly remove and insert the iPhone without getting attacked by them. I am working on a special \"cage\" to coil the headphones around before inserting them into the case.My final complaint with this case is the most serious, and it's a major flaw with the current design. The audio throughput cable has only three wires - not four - so it is impossible to use your iPhone headphone's microphone or music control button when the iPhone is in the case. There is absolutely no excuse for this, and I was very disappointed to find it out. I can't wait for Pelican to release an updated case - or even to just mail me a new cable that I could install once they get this figured out.Update - 2010-09-09:Pelican has upgraded this product, and the version they are now selling includes a TRRS cable which will allow you to use a headset and control your music while your phone is in the case.Pelican mailed me a new TRRS cable free of charge, and it works great!Also, this case will PERFECTLY fit an iPhone 4 with Apple's bumper installed if you take a sharp pair of scissors and trim down the ribs which support the back of the protrusions on the rubber liner against the clear outer shell.Here's some pics of my modded case:[...]", "Date": "March 27, 2010"}, {"Title": "Great for outdoor sports.", "Author": "TheTodd1981 \"TheTodd\"", "ReviewID": "R14PK0UJ878I6S", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Not a case for everyday use, it's far too large to carry comfortably in most situations.  However, there are situations when this case works out very well.  I spend a lot of time kayaking, and this case is perfect for being out on the water, when used with some water resistant headphones.  I wouldn't go swimming with it, but it's survived all of the splashes and minor soakings it's received while out on the kayak.  The clip is pretty convenient, I just clip it to my vest or shorts, and no worries whenever a swell gives a bit of a splash.I use the case with a 2nd Gen iPod Touch, which fits easily and securely into the case.  Because of the foam inserts in the front of the case, it will also fit other similar-sized electronics, even if they're a bit thicker.  I have a G1 phone, and it fits right in as well.  As with all Pelican cases, it's very sturdy, and I have no doubts I could throw my iPod at a wall, drop it on the ground, sit on it, maybe even stand on it with no damage.Only problem is that you cannot operate the iPod whenever the case is closed.  If you have a good music list, it's not really a problem, and as long as you're relatively dry, it only takes a moment to open the front and do what you need to.", "Date": "May 31, 2010"}, {"Title": "Cheap Insurance", "Author": "Mark Fleser", "ReviewID": "R12RMEHPN849FJ", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This is going to be cheap insurance for my iPhone 4 when I'm doing things outdoors.

I saw a Youtube video that said that the remote on the earbuds did not work, he might have been using and older version of the case, or he just didn't know what he was talking about, because the one I received has the standard 3 ring headphone plug that supports the mic and playback controls!  The picture and description is a little deceiving because it says \"black\" as the color, the gasket that seals the case and holds the device is black, the case itself is all clear, not a big deal though.  So far it looks like this is going to be a good case and heavy duty protection.", "Date": "July 3, 2010"}, {"Title": "THIS CASE IS THE REAL DEAL!!", "Author": "hugh d scott", "ReviewID": "R12P0YA6LP25YI", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I'm surprised to see so many less than outstanding reviews for this case.  I don't know if Amazon has corrected the \"wrong description\" problem that everyone else seems to be upset about, but I received the case as listed with a clear lid (ordered July 2010).This case is the REAL DEAL!  I work in construction, so I'm constantly worried about my ipod being crushed in my pocket, or spilling coffee on myself or getting wet working in the rain or (most of all) getting my device DUSTY.  For me the dustproof and crushproof features are the payoff.  I never put myself in a situation where I might drop my $300 ipod into water so I'm not concerned with the difference between \"watertight\" and \"splashproof\" as another reviewer is.  It is NOT idiot-proof.I saw a remark in another review about the headphone jack being incompatible with the ipod headphone/microphone.  Again, the case I received has the three wire jack and works fine with the voice control and other microphone related features.A word about bulk: this unit is a bit bulky compared to most ipod cases.  But the extra bulk is equal to the extra protection.  I still keep mine in my pocket while I work and even in tight fitting work pants it fits fine and is not uncomfortable ( I don't sit down at work)All the obvious cons other reviewers have listed are obvious.  No, you can't touch your \"ipod touch\"  through the lid.  It is easy, however, to operate the touch screen while the ipod is still in the case with the lid open.  The rubber tabs that hold it in place do so fairly well with the lid open.Wi-fi works fine with the ipod in the case.  If you have a very weak connection you might improve it slightly by removing it.In my opinion, and for the way I use my device this case is worth the money twice over.  I was thrilled that it was less than thirty bucks and even more so when all of the things I was worried about from other reviews turned out to be (for me) not true.", "Date": "September 14, 2010"}, {"Title": "Pelican case vs. the H20 Audio Armband case", "Author": "John Rawlins", "ReviewID": "R3CDFMJJJC3KD3", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Hi,In my quest for something to protect my iPhone from water and sand I've tried a few different products.  The two most robust are this Pelican case and the Armband case from H20 Audio.  The H20 armband is also currently available from Amazon and might be something to consider depending on how you intend to use them.Although both products are designed to keep your iPhone dry they differ considerably in construction.  Each has its merits and I'll run through a few of them.- Both provide good protection from water.  They seal well and the latches are secure.- The Pelican is far more crush proof.  If you plan on throwing your phone in a dry bag with all your gear and taking it on a rafting or kayaking trip it's a solid choice.- The H20 Armband is constructed primarily of wetsuit material.  It offers a measure of padding particularly on the sides and back.  However, the front of the phone is covered by a thin sheet of transparent vinyl.  Gear rubbing against it could easily damage or tear the vinyl and damage the iPhone.- The best thing about the H20 armband is you can operate the touch screen while it's in the case.  Voice control will only get you so far.  If you want to read your email or check sports scores you need more than voice control.- The Pelican has a little bit of room for additional storage.  Though there isn't a great deal of space it's enough to fit in your ear-buds, a key or two, and some cash.  The armband has very little extra space.- The H20 Armband is a very tight squeeze for the iPhone.  I always worry about getting the phone in and out of the case without harming it.- The Pelican case is considerably less expensive.  You can get two or three or them for what the armband costs.It really comes down to your intended applications.  Ignoring the price difference if you want something primarily for listening to music and providing excellent storage the Pelican is great.  However, if you want a case that will allow you to use all the features of your phone during your activities the H20 Armband is the winner in my opinion.Best regards,John", "Date": "January 7, 2011"}, {"Title": "What's better for your iPod - Pelican i1010 or Otter Box?", "Author": "LEE", "ReviewID": "R37BPTD3LAHKWT", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "In a side-by-side comparison, the Otter Box appears to be a better waterproof or water-resistant case for an iPod.The Otter Box is much thinner than the Pelican i1010 and the iPod's scroll wheel can be used when the Otter Box case is closed.  There is, however, a serious drawback to the Otter Box in that it's designed for a specific model.  For example, I have a Otter Box for a 20GB iPod.  When I upgraded to a 80GB iPod Classic, it would not fit my Otter Box so it became a useless dinosaur.Unlike the Otter Box, the Pelican i1010 fits my 80GB iPod Classic so it also fits most other iPods including the Shuttle and Nano (NOT the iTouch, there's a different Pelican for the iTouch).  This means if I switch between different models of iPods, I can still use the same Pelican i1010.  It won't become a dinosaur like my Otter Box.  If for some reason I find myself no longer using an iPod, I can pull out the liner and use the Pelican i1010 as a small general-purpose waterproof box.I've been using the Pelican i1010 to protect my iPod when I sea kayak and it works flawlessly.  I thought about buying a cheaper waterproof \"dry bag\" for iPods, but it didn't offer the same rugged construction of a Pelican to protect my iPod.In an overview of all pros and cons, the Pelican i1010 wins compared to the Otter Box.", "Date": "March 15, 2010"}, {"Title": "Nice case, but also received the black one.", "Author": "J.J. \"J.J.\"", "ReviewID": "R3CW5TDXZIKZV2", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "Just to reaffirm what the other reviewers stated, I received a totally black case.Even the lid is black, so basically I'm just putting my iPod in a box. Even though the touch screen would be unusable even with a clear lid, you would at least be able to watch a movie, or see what song is playing, etc. Besides that, the case itself is very rugged and does as advertised.Pros: Rugged, headphone jack is nice, clip is a handy featureCons: No access to touchscreen, black lid makes it unusable to view movies, and no access to charge or dock iPod.All in all I will be returning the case due to the black lid. I figured, when ordering, that the touchscreen would be unaccessable and there would be no option to charge the iPod in the case, but the black lid basically makes this an iPod shuffle.", "Date": "April 3, 2010"}, {"Title": "Fantastic, just a bit needlessly large", "Author": "Andrew \"Andrew the Cook\"", "ReviewID": "R2208M6Q97KFC9", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I've learned that my iPhone is a great replacement for a GPS when I mountain bike.  And last weekend, I also learned that when I go over the handlebars and land on my iPhone in my backpack, its screen shatters into a million glittery pieces.So, not wanting to give up on the great GPS functions (not to mention the ability to call someone should I have an emergency within cell phone range) of my iPhone, but not wanting the shattering to occur again, I began to search for a suitable case.While the OtterBox Defender Case iPhone 4 (Blue/Black, Fits AT&T; iPhone 4) is generally lauded at doing a good job of protecting your phone from drops and dings, I'm certain it wouldn't do anything if your screen got smashed between - let's say - your falling body and a rock.  Also, since I'm just looking for a case to use while I'm riding, the Defender seems to require quite a bit of effort to put on and take off.After some looking around, I realized that the only crush-proof cases would be one that didn't allow me to use my phone's touchscreen while it was inside.  I don't ever listen to music while I'm biking, so headphone access wasn't important to me.  Those requirements narrowed me down to Pelican and Otterbox's waterproof cases.In terms of appearance, I actually prefer the Otterbox cases, but the OtterBox 1000 Series Waterproof Case is too small to hold an iPhone, and the next size up, the OtterBox Waterproof Universal Case (Black) has an interior dimension of 5.757\" x 3.140\", which would leave your iPhone rattling around without some extra padding, and I'd prefer to not be carrying around too much extra bulk in any case.So, that left me with either this case, or the Pelican Micro Protective Case (Black) - which is the i1015 case without the headphone port and interior headphone storage winder thing.  Even though I don't generally listen to music while I ride, I  figured it might be nice to have the option, so I went with the i1015.So far, I'm quite happy with that decision.  My phone fits nicely in the case.  There's plenty of room to fit headphones or other accessories in there, but everything is snug and feels well protected.  I'm certain my phone in this case would survive the type of crash I had last weekend, and should I move from Southern California to someplace that occasionally rains, it'd be nice to know that my phone would survive a deluge.My only complaint, and reason for a 4* review instead of a 5*, is that the case has some needless bulk.  It's clear when you handle the case that removing the (useless to me) headphone storage area would let it reduce its depth by close to 50%, and it feels like the height and perhaps width could be reduced by another 20% or so without negatively impacting its protective capabilities.If Pelican or Otterbox builds a waterproof case with a reduced profile, to fit the iPhone 4 exactly, I'll be the first in line to buy it.  Until then, the i1015 is the best option out there for people like me who like to bring their phones along in the outdoors.", "Date": "July 15, 2011"}, {"Title": "Awesome buy!", "Author": "MABruss \"MABruss\"", "ReviewID": "R3CKSZ0N6NAFXZ", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Now I have absolutely no worries about my new iPod touch getting ruined!

Headphones (the ear bud kind) store well inside the case, and the headphone jack makes them easy to use.  The little storage pocket also works well for holding cash or ID.

I got this case to protect my Moto X while I'm out camping or hiking.  I took careful measurements of my phone's dimensions and checked them against the internal dimensions posted on Pelican's website.  With some slight modifications to the rubber insert, my Moto x fits securely inside the case.  The rubber insert isn't solid, but rather about 1/16\" thick.  With a sharp X-Acto knife I was able to carefully cut away some material from the wings that hold the phone so that my Moto fits snugly, but not tight.  The only complaint I have is that I can't use the integrated weatherproof jack, but that's more of a function of my phone's size and jack location than a problem with the case.  It was, after all, designed with Apple products in mind.

It must be solid enough, which is why it does get four stars, but the feel of it just gives me the impression of a cheap tupperware bin or a child's toy rather than a professional rugged tool.The lines you can see on the picture do 'fit in' with lines on the bottom, so if you have two of the same size they will stack and will not slide side to side, though they will slide front to back.

This case for my ipod touch is a nice addition, but it needs a little tweaking in the details.  First, the storage for the earphones is awkward.  Having to remove the ipod from the case to get at the earphones (they coil up beneath the unit around a central rubber \"core\") is not only awkward but also somewhat defeats the purpose of having it in a protective case.  It also doesn't hold onto the ipod well.  When closed, the ipod is held quite firmly, but when opened, the little rubber \"fingers\" do not grip it tightly enough to prevent it from falling out if tipped upside down.  The cord which plugs into the earphone jack to allow you to plug in your ear buds from the outside does in fact allow the use of the microphone on your earbuds so that is a nice feature.  All in all, a nice protective case, but I have to carry my earbuds externally to avoid the juggling act required to carry them \"in case\".  One more thing, be sure to apply one of those clear protective films to the outside of the \"viewing panel\" molded into the case or it will quickly become hazed with scratches.", "Date": "July 19, 2010"}, {"Title": "Not as advertised !!!", "Author": "Padraven", "ReviewID": "R20SKERL2EQW9G", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "Supposed to be a clear case as pictured and described...as others have stated...it arrives in black.", "Date": "April 8, 2010"}, {"Title": "Pelican i1015 hard case", "Author": "J.

Throw your phone in this thing if your going kayaking, mountain climbing, or on the beach. Its not for everyday use, but at the price its worth having one. I know it's only watertight but on the good faith of a product made in the USA I threw my phone in a container of dishwater and left it submerged for about 5 minutes, this is by no means any guarantee but it came out totally dry, so I'm sure its watertight as they say. The only downside to this thing is that the liner has to be in it for the watertight ability, and it takes up about half the case with storage for headphones and a cushion for your phone. this case also works with the mic and volume control on a set of iPhone headphones.
