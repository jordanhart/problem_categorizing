I really like every feature, not the least of which is the ability to set the resolution of pictures in pixels.  Very simple to operate, my wife loves it also.  Picture quality is wonderful, battery takes over 300 pics on a charge.  I would recommend this product to anyone, and I would purchase another if needed.  Dealing with Amazon and 6th Ave was excellent.", "Date": "September 27, 2010"}, {"Title": "Love this camera", "Author": "UKWildcatMom", "ReviewID": "R1WIG7VS2WLCK5", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I got this as a gift for my birthday after buying one for our daughter.  I liked hers so much I asked for one for myself.  I like the front panel that slides down and that is what turns the camera on.  It takes great pictures - each to use - zooms great and has a BIG screen on the back for viewing pics.  Love it.", "Date": "April 24, 2013"}, {"Title": "So Awesome bought another one!", "Author": "Andrew Pliszka", "ReviewID": "RPX3MLT3R8RMS", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I first bought this camera a while ago as a gift for a work associate. His computer skills and photo knowledge was about zero but did he ever shoot great video and super nice photos! This outperformed a similar class Nikon digital camera that my wife had been using.She tried this one and was amazed at the 1. Ease of use to get great photos'.  2. Excellent testimonial by the gifted camera recipient.3. Compact \"self storing\" lens, (i.e. You cannot lose a lens cap as I have done and my friends have done because the lens \"cap\" is a cover that simply slides to the side! Great feature!).Photos are rivaling my high end digital camera! This is a leader in its class!As a foot note, While on vacation in Costa Rica I met a wildlife Pro photog who insists on the lumix camera line as an addition to his very pricey camera's and lenses!You can easily buy a digital cam with more megapixels but all you really need is upwards of 3.0 megapixels for the average photo printing of 8x10's and smaller. This should be in EVERY camera enthusiants line!", "Date": "April 7, 2013"}, {"Title": "Love this!", "Author": "GreeneggsnHamman", "ReviewID": "R15SCVW8411T87", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I had issues with two previous cameras (Sony CyberShot and Nikon CoolPix) The lenses that came out got broken and bent and the camera became obsolete! A drop shouldn't kill the lens. So this camera is great! There is no lens that out, but the camera is great. I have taken wonderful sunset photos among others! I highly recommend it!", "Date": "May 14, 2012"}, {"Title": "Nice Surprise!!!", "Author": "ChinaWhite \"shoegirl\"", "ReviewID": "RGE7PBZ7M1AED", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "We were completely surprised we got so much bang for the buck.  At first I was very sceptical and was about to return the camera because it is true that when you review the photos on the camera's display, that it's like looking through a smoke screen as one reviewer said.  But be assured that when you download your photos onto your computer, the photos turn out very nice.  So the display screen is cheap and it's obvious that Panasonic did not invest much money in their display screen but they sure invest it in the features and photo quality.  In fact, the camera takes awesome pictures in low light settings, much better than some more expensive cameras can...which I was really impressed with.  Also, the camera is very fast with lots of great features.  My husband loves it so much we almost ordered another one.  I would have given it a 5 star if it wasn't for the display screen but overall I highly recommend this camera if you're looking for a nice point and shoot.  For the price, it's worth every penny because we've looked at many cameras and this camera is the best value with the most.", "Date": "April 20, 2012"}, {"Title": "Awesome pictures.", "Author": "The Man with the plan", "ReviewID": "R3ODG5EKYUV64X", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I am by no means a photographer of any kind. But i'll tell ya. Was almost imposible to take a bad picture. in fact the only pics I don't like the look of... are the ones with my face in them!

The ones that did not I was moving and they were blurry.  Fantastic battery life, very pleasant surprise!  For the price, I am ecstatic.
