{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Amazingly cheap camera for features", "Author": "Peter Bradley", "ReviewID": "R2D75MQLC01DBL", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I am very pleased with this camera. This is the third Nikon I have owned and the best by far, and all three are great.I have found no problems with this camera, and the accessories that came in the bundle are good too. The tripod is a little stiff and flakes of paint come off the legs when you bend them, but you can't tell where they came from by just looking at it. The carrying case is plenty big and surprizingly well built.The camera really surprized me. The display screen and picture quality are supurb, and the menus are straight forward.If I had to say something bad about the camera I would say it is advertised to shoot MPEG-4 videos but doesn't. It only shoots MOV files which is no problem for me. Maybe you can convert them with ViewNX, the software that comes with the camera, but I haven't tried yet. This camera is smaller than I expected it to be. The advertised picture is deceiving to size, but that's not a problem either.The picture quality is very clear with the 16.1 MP, and the 26X zoom gets very close to what you are shooting. Taking 3D pictures takes a little getting use to. It puts a sillouette on the screen of half the picture you just shot, then you line it up with the image on the screen and it automatically saves the shot. If it fails or succeeds to line up it does not save the first picture, only the 3D shot.Videos are easy. Push the button to start recording, and push it to stop. It has left and right microphones on either side of the flash that pick up sounds decently.Overall, for less than $300 you get a camera that does options that $500 and up cameras advertise. If you are looking for a camera under $200 I would suggest spending a little more and getting this one.", "Date": "April 27, 2012"}, {"Title": "Perfect Little Point and Shoot for the Novice!", "Author": "Smayw", "ReviewID": "R1E1GPEM69X5X7", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I received this camera only 1 day after purchasing it and immediately tried it out.  It was very simple to operate and start taking pictures within a few minutes.  Buying the package made this camera even easier to operate-no guessing what I might need-it was all included!The camera worked very well for what I needed-a simple little point and shoot camera that takes nice pictures with little to no effort.  The only negative I found was that it can be slow to take pictures or change zoom function. For the price, I couldn't beat it!", "Date": "June 16, 2012"}, {"Title": "Exellent nikon bundle", "Author": "Gabo Erives", "ReviewID": "R1U4QDB27WXEQT", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Exellent camera, I recomend it, exellent camera for the travellers, the things in the combo are really good, really quickly deliver, confort size in the cam and all the things in the package", "Date": "July 19, 2012"}, {"Title": "Nice Camera Package, Good Price!", "Author": "Angela D Bloss", "ReviewID": "R3CN899O5KQDJM", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "'Easy to use, takes great pictures, small camera with a zoom that is really awesome.

However as a Nikon user for over 40 years it did not meet my expectations.  Takes way too long as it \"hunts\" to focus...I can manually focus my old Nikkormat and take several pictures while the L820 is hunting.  Even the 990 had superior focusing.
