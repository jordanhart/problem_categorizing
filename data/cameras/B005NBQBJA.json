Schmidt \"Lesley\"", "ReviewID": "RHZZ8PZ5BBG3J", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I owned this camera for 2 months and I took it with me to Hawaii.  The camera seems to work fine in the pool and low humidity areas, but stopped working in Hawaii.  First the camera lens started fogging up (on the inside so you can clean it) so all my pictures outside the water are foggy.  Then I took it in the water on the snorkel trip and then it completely stopped working.  I opened the sealed compartment and the SD card was wet.  Now I have been reading other people's reviews and the same things are happening to them.  I have a year warranty so I called Nikon.  Horrible customer service.  They make you ship the camera back to them (on your own dime) so they can determine if you broke it or if it is a manufacturer's default.  Then they will try to fix it and may charge me to fix it.  They said this could take over a month so I probably won't be able to use it again this summer and test out their fixes.  They are refusing to send me a new camera or refund my money so I can buy a different camera (looking at the Pentax).  Don't be disappointed like I was and avoid this camera!", "Date": "August 21, 2012"}, {"Title": "Great Camera", "Author": "bobjr21w", "ReviewID": "R30GFNEXDVS931", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Out of the box it was smaller then expected. I'm not an expert photographer but it does take some nice pictures. The one tripod is a nice additive.  I have not used it in or near water yet, so I can not say whether or not it will fry the first time it gets wet.  the features are east to use and quite similar to my 6 y/o Nikon.  I'm glad I got the kit and not just the camera.", "Date": "February 10, 2012"}, {"Title": "Excellent Camera", "Author": "LCRD1", "ReviewID": "R2CVG68MPJ036N", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "This is a great camera, and good price,  the only weak point is battery. altough having spare one. it last no more than 30 or 40 pics  per battery.  dealer must upgrade camera case to carry spare battery and charger", "Date": "January 19, 2012"}, {"Title": "excellent choice it is.", "Author": "ever1309", "ReviewID": "R3HDV7LGS7JRLR", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "finally it arrived.
