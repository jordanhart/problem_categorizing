I used it to take photos of the moon one evening,I put the camera on a tripod and zoomed out as far as it would go. I aimed it at the moon, set it on self timer and and took photo. I was amazed at the clarity and detail f the moon. You can see the craters and mountains very well. Be sure to buy at least one extra battery as I ran out on one battery after 352 shots, however I did have to use various zoom settings which does draw power. Everything about the kit I ordered was good except the two tripods seem to be very cheap grade. Tripods drag while opening and closing.", "Date": "March 30, 2014"}, {"Title": "great camera", "Author": "PAT DEWITT", "ReviewID": "R1RLD6H5Q9TUO7", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "this is the 3rd one I have purchased, one for my wife ,then one for my sister, and this last one for my daughter , they all love them", "Date": "March 25, 2014"}, {"Title": "Not what I was looking for", "Author": "armySSGwife", "ReviewID": "RUS2C4GK01AW1", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "Pictures turn out great...if the subject is not moving.
