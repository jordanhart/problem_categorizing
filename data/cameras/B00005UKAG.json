Regardless of what others say, the duration of the info-lithium battery is quite long.  What amazes me is the color fidelity and the incredible adaptability of this camera.  I have captured shots in some of the most difficult lighting conditions, right next to my father using a $1000 Nikon 990 and the sony shots look superior.  Match this camera up with a Viao 505 laptop with a built in memory stick reader, and the combo is unstoppable.  Video features are great, and the ability to annotate sound with photographs is fun.  VERY high quality sound out of such a tiny mic!!  I don't know how they pulled that off.Bottom line:1  User friendly / Easy to navigate2  Hi Quality Pics3  Great battery life", "Date": "May 25, 2002"}, {"Title": "Great camera bulky battery charger", "Author": "Jose Lopez Nunez \"Jose Lopez\"", "ReviewID": "R1PL2E7W5JI3ND", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I purchased this camera not too long ago. The quality of the pictures is great, the controls are conveniently located and the menu commands are very easy to use. The battery life is OK but not outstanding, a spare battery is a must. I used with a 32 MB memory stick, plenty for all your needs even working at the highest picture quality level (about 40 shots). Overall a very good product. The battery charger is very bulky,this is why I do not give it 5 stars.Jose Lopez", "Date": "June 17, 2002"}, {"Title": "Broken within 4 months", "Author": "Bridget E. \"beschenbach\"", "ReviewID": "R3AATIZT373ZE1", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "This camera broke within 4 months, and the warantee only covers 3 months for labor.

Picture quality on the onboard monitor is pretty amazing, but is hard to see in bright sunshine. In these situations, you can use the viewfinder, and a lcd panel displays camera info. Camera plugs either directly in your pc (usb) or into a television/video thru RCA plugs. The pictures look amazing on the TV !  A 128 memory stick will give you over 1970 (yes, nearly 2000) \"standard\" quality pictures !  We were considering a digital video camera, brought this instead, and have not regretted our decision.  If you mainly take still pictures with occassional video, add this camera to your list to look at.  Haggle with the retailer to throw in a camera bag, as you WILL need somewhere to keep the memory sticks, power and connector cords when you travel.", "Date": "September 18, 2002"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": "Unavailable", "Features": "Pocketable digital camera with a 2.8-megapixel CCD-weighs less than 8 ounces\nDigital zoom to 3x\n1.5-inch LCD for previewing your photos\nBuilt-in flash and included 8MB Memory Stick media card for picture storage\nInfoLithium NP-FC10 battery included", "Name": "Sony DSCP3 Cybershot 2.8MP Digital Camera", "ImgURL": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41A3BQEQ8YL._SX300_.jpg", "ProductID": "B00005UKAG"}}
