Lin", "ReviewID": "R2IAO2A0T1F5VA", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I have had tons of digital cameras before and I have always sold them on eBay to get rid of them. Canon is by far the best digital camera I have ever owned. I previously had an SD10 for the last 3 years and am still happy with it. 3 yrs is a long time for me considering I am a bit of a techie that likes to change all of my electronics whenever a new one comes out. So for me the SD630 is finally a well deserved upgrade...LOVE IT. The LCD screen is amazing and there are tons of new features that I did not have on my SD10. Everything with this camera is terrific. The only thing and only thing I can say is that there is not a battery meter, the meter only shows up when it is already running out of battery. This was the same for the SD10 and it was quite annoying. Anyways, definately buy a backup battery just in case.Other than that, you cannot go wrong with this camera...", "Date": "May 27, 2006"}, {"Title": "Excellent Product - Picked Out After Much Research...", "Author": "E. Navarro", "ReviewID": "RZJRT9U2PJG48", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I just received my Canon SD-630 in the mail today and can already say I am very happy with my purchase. I had been researching cameras the entire week, looking for the right one for my needs.When I went to the store, Best Buy, I had written down a few camera model numbers that caught my eye. Over the next few days it was interesting to see how my perceptions of these cameras had changed. I had at first liked the 7.1 Megapixel Sony I had put at the top of my list at Best Buy. I based this on merely the camera having a high megapixel count and the looks of the outer casing. But after getting on Amazon and reading product descriptions, going over reviews, and looking at shots submitted by customers all of my original perceptions changed.While the Sony may have looked good and had a higher megapixel count than my Canon, it was the features that attracted me to the SD-630. I liked that it had some interesting options to play around with besides just the usual camera settings like outdoor, indoor, etc...  Besides the basics, the Canon has options like Color Accent and Color Swap. These features really let you produce some unique prints without having to do any post manipulation with programs such as Photoshop. I myself had done similar work with photos using Photoshop, to make certain objects color while the rest of the image remained black and white. But this takes time depending on the object and its nice to be able to achieve the same results without any work! Its also very easy to use and I took some great shots in no time.Another camera I was interested in was the Kodak V570. After reading the feature list on this camera, such as the Panorama Stitch and Wide Angle Lens I thought it was perfect. Plus the pictures I viewed looked very cool when incorporating these modes. But some of the reviews on the camera turned me away somewhat. Such as having to use the supplied dock as well as Kodak software just to upload the images to my computer or charge the battery. I like the flexibility of the Canon, allowing you to transfer images via USB cable or memory card without having to use any other software. The battery charger is also very compact, no cords or large battery trays, just a simple charger that has a folding plug for easy transport (the charger is the size of a small cell phone - probably smaller).Yet I still liked the Panorama Stitch option that the Kodak offered and was really considering this camera as my final pick. So I decided to go back to the store and look at these cameras again now that I had done the research and knew what I was looking for. It was a whole different experience than my first visit to Best Buy. When I played with the Kodak it just didn't live up to what I had hoped for. I was put off by the button layout and the overall feel of the camera when compared to the Canon. After finally figuring out how to do the Panorama Stitch, while it was a cool little feature, it just wasn't all that great on the camera. The screen is small and when your grouping so many different images together, 3, its hard to really see what you are doing and to get a shot exactly as you want. I'm sure after some use I would get use to it, but to get the full effect you would have to upload the image to a computer and look at it from there to see if it came out the way you intended. The camera just seemed simple in terms of functionality.The Canon, which I had tested out before this camera, was a whole different story. I really liked how everything was laid out and the big screen made looking at images so much easier. Thus when you used an option such as Color Accent, you could really get a sense of how the final product turned out and decide if you were happy with the shot (or needed to do a retake) without having to view the image on a computer. It has so many different options to play with that are very useful in the simplest terms; such as Vivid Colors. I took a few pictures of the same objects using this mode and some in just Auto. You can really see a nice subtle difference and in some cases the colors just pop when compared to normal. It is very nice to use and is a great compliment to the camera. Simple features such as this are excellent and let you take great pictures without having to adjust manual settings. But if you would like to tinker with manual options, the camera leaves plenty of room to do this as well (which was another feature I was looking for, as I wanted to get more involved with the camera over time).The video on this camera is also excellent. I remember taking videos on older digital cameras I have used and they were pretty low quality. I do a lot of video editing and such, and found the video option on this camera to be very nice. It really lets you take some quality footage, that if you showed a clip to someone off of your computer they would think it was taken with a camcorder. Another nice thing about the video is that you can use Color Accent and Color Swap, which I did not know was possible until reading the manual. It makes your video much more interesting if used in the right way and adds a touch that would require high level video editing software (AVID, After Affects) to attain. This does it without any other work.Overall I am very pleased with this camera and would definitely recommend it to anyone who is thinking of purchasing this model. Like I said, after reading reviews and customer feedback on Amazon as well as other sites that tested these cameras, I completely changed my initial impressions of what I thought I was looking for. If I were you I would make sure to go out and test out cameras you have in your Top 3 after reading all the great information found on this site. It really helps you make a confident decision in your purchase, such as the one I made. I had read before that Canon made excellent digital cameras, some of the best available, and can definitely back that up with my experience in just one day of use. I cant wait to use this camera more often and really get to know the many features it has to offer. I made sure to upload some pictures I just took today for others to see, hope this review has helped in some way.The only things I would seek to improve on this camera would be the addition of a wide angle lens and better construction of the tiny little door that covers the USB connection and AV cable connetion.  It seems a little brittle and I would be very careful when opening and shutting it.  Im sure it will be fine with proper caution, but if you were to open it fast or tug on it hardly, it could possibly rip and detach.  Only gripe I see to express, but nothing too major.", "Date": "May 20, 2006"}, {"Title": "One Awesome Camera", "Author": "J Brock \"Jeff\"", "ReviewID": "RTI2YAUPFQS7P", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This Canon SD630 camera replaced my \"garbage\" Sony that suddenly stopped working.  I love this camera!PROS:1. HUGE 3\" LCD screen (the main reason I bought this camera).2. Excellent picture quality.3. Tons of pre-set settings including \"fireworks\" (which takes perfect photo's of fireworks).4. Lots of manual settings if you prefer, including high ISO, white balance, etc.5. Takes top quality videos (at up to 30 frames/sec at 640X480 - similar quality as that of full-featured video cameras).6. You can upload any WAV and JPG files to personalize all the camera's settings (the sound and picture that shows when you turn on your camera, the sound the shutter makes, the sound of the buttons when navigating settings, etc.).7. When reviewing your pictures, the built-in \"gyro\" will flip the orientation of your photo when you tilt the camera going from \"portrait mode\" to \"landscape mode\" and vice-versa.8. The \"colour swap\" feature will have designers and decorators drooling.  You take a picture of say, a house, then aim the pin-point in the middle of the LCD screen at a colour on the house that you want to change and press the shutter button, then aim the camera on the colour you want to change it to and press the shutter button, then voila!, the original picture of the house now appears with the new colour you had just personally selected!9. It takes only about 15 minutes to fully charge the battery (NB-4L, Li-ion) in the included external battery charger.10. The \"auto create directory\" feature is great.  You can set the camera to create a new directory every day (or at a certain time) so when returning from your holiday, all your pictures are filed in folders according to the date you took them.11. The \"photo stitch\" feature is awesome.  Select this feature then snap a picture, rotate yourself a few degrees, take another picture, rotate, etc.  The PC software will take all these shots and combine them into one panoramic picture.CONS:1. There isn't a visual battery-life meter; it only appears when the battery is almost dead, so it's hard to tell how much battery life you have left until it's too late.  I bought a second battery that I carry with my camera just in case.2. Flimsy cover on the USB and AV/OUT terminals.3. When you connect the camera to your PC, the camera isn't recognized as a \"removable device\" (which is preferred with digital cameras), so you can't just copy pictures back and forth in Windows Explorer.  The camera requires it's own software to download your pictures.4. The built-in speaker is located on the top of the camera (it isn't facing you), so it's difficult to hear videos when you're playing them back on the LCD screen.The \"PROS\" far outweigh the \"CONS\" with this camera.  I couldn't be happier with my purchase.  Prepare to meet new people when you're out using this camera - people are amazed at the size of the LCD screen.", "Date": "July 17, 2006"}, {"Title": "Great improvement over Previous Cannon SDs", "Author": "Mark W. Treu", "ReviewID": "R1UOA2SYS1NR6I", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I purchased this camera as a replacement for my SD-400.  I loved the SD-400 except that I broke the LCD twice.  I was not about to replace the LCD for a second time so I went shopping for a new camera.  I take over 1,000 photos a week on this camera as I use it as a primary tool in my job.  They have added a rigid protection barrier for the LCD whih pretty much eliminates my only complaint with previous SD Models.  Let me give you my quick Pro / Con List:Pros:-Size:  It is the perfect size.  I can't imagine working with a camera that is any smaller.-Weight:  It is light weight and easily fits in your pocket even after you put it in a hardshell case.-Picture Quality:  Far superior picture quality as compared to other 6 MegaPixel Cameras.  This is of course due to the higher quality lenses and the precision auto focusing.-Availability of backup batteries:  Duracell makes an excellent battery for this camera.  NB-4L  It is fairly inexpensive as Lithium Ion batteries go and it is easy to find.-SD Memory:  It takes SD card memory which make life easier and less expensive.-3\" LCD.  The LCD on this camera is very larger and it is beautiful.  Feels like I am using my MiniDV Camera.-Software Interface:  This camera is very easy to use and the menus are intuitive and simple to navigate.-LCD Protection:  The LCD is behind a rigid clear protecting surface which seems to be fairly resistant to damage.Cons:-Battery Life.  This camera does not use AA Batteries so if you have a 512MB card or larger, then you will probably have to charge the battery before you get through the entire card.  The large LCD uses a bit more energy so this camera doesn't have as much battery life as its predecessor.  The trade off is well worth it in my opinion.  I recommend purchasing a backup battery (NB-4L) for those long sessions.-No View Finder:  There is no view finder, means in the really bright sun it is somewhat difficult to take pictures.  Although it is not as others I have owned.I recommend this camera to anyone who wants fantastic quality photos and an easy to use easy to carry camera.Good Luck!", "Date": "August 4, 2006"}, {"Title": "Canon SD630 is a BIG little camera!", "Author": "A Conrad \"Ask Conrad\"", "ReviewID": "R24SGRSDL7UGH7", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "The Canon PowerShot SD630 is a small yet fierce compact point-and-shoot camera. This little 6-megapixel camera managed to bundle performance and snappy photos into a package you can easily carry in your shirt or pants pocket.  I recently upgraded from the Canon SD450, and I am so glad that I got the SD630 (rather than the SD600).  THE SD630 is almost identical to its little brother, the PowerShot SD600.  The SD630 incorporates the same sensor, lens, and internal components.  The only advantage over the less expensive SD600 is its 3-inch LCD screen, but had to lose the viewfinder in the process (which I never used anyway).The first thing that jumped out and caught my attention is the (relatively) HUGE 3\" LCD screen.  It provides plenty of room to frame your shot but not so much room to operate the camera.  Granted, the pixel count on this screen is the same as the 2.5\" screen on the SD600, I still like the larger view.  The buttons on the back include a standard four-way rocker control pad, menu, display, and a button for printing when the camera is hooked up to a PictBridge-compatible printer.  If you have large hands, you'll probably find its control layout a little uncomfortable, and it doesn't have an optical viewfinder, but the SD630 is still a great compact camera.  Once you get the hang of it, the pad allows \"easy\" navigation around the menu system, and you can directly set options such as the self-timer, continuous shooting, macro, flash, and ISO sensitivity. The top edge of the camera holds the shutter release, the zoom rocker, the power button, and a slider for switching between photo, movie, and playback modes. The zoom rocker is a tabbed ring around the shutter release similar to the SD600, facing the front edge of the camera.  Some users have mentioned that it is uncomfortable for large fingers and extremely awkward to operate with one hand, especially when zooming out.  I have large/x-large hands, and I find no problems using the controllers.The Canon PowerShot SD630 has a decent amount of features that give its tiny form a nice amount of flexibility. Canon couples a 6-megapixel CCD with up to 3x optical zoom (35mm-to-105mm equivalent) lens. The lens has a pretty narrow maximum aperture of f/2.8 to f/4.9, with a shutter-speed range of 1/1,500 second to 15 seconds, average numbers for models in this space. The camera has automatic, program, and manual exposure modes with a range of plus or minus 2EV in 1/3EV steps, which is also on a par with the competition. Its sensitivity range goes as high as ISO 800; that's not quite as much as Fujifilm's and Sony's latest offerings, but it will still give you more low-light flexibility than most cameras of its size.I won't go into the details of the measurements, but I have to mention that it is less than an inch thick with its lens tucked in (great to carry around).  It is easier to carry around than the SD450, or my ancient S200 (yes, the CompactFlash version!).  I liked that the right side of the body is somewhat shaped/curved, because it lets the user hold the camera comfortably in your right hand.In addition to standard automatic and manual exposure modes, the SD630 offers a handful of scene modes.  One will also find options for photographing beaches, plants, snowy days, and fireworks (not available on the SD450). It even has an underwater mode to use in conjunction with the optional underwater housing (for extra $$). Color Accent and Color Swap modes can filter and change colors in the camera, producing some neat artistic effects.  And, the camera has an awesome 30fps VGA movie capture mode, which can be used in conjuction with the Color Accent modes and other features.  I've shot a 45 minute movie of my 4-month old daughter (I have a 2Gb SD card) with no hiccups, and I think I could have gone longer.The SD630 takes a little over a second from power-on to the first shot, and takes about 2 seconds between shots, which increases marginally with flash.  I haven't tried the burst mode yet, but it is supposed to shoot at 2.1fps with no buffer constraint on the number of shots.So far, the photos I have taken with the SD630 were quite pleasing, looked crisp and clear, and nice color reproduction (at least with my poor eyes) at the lower ISO range. However, images become noisy at ISO 400 and ISO 800 (as expected), but still usable.  I will be doing a field test against my Digital SLR (Nikon D100), results pending.  Also, I have not used the bundled software, which is supposed to be very good.Conclusion:I am happy with my purchase of the Canon PowerShot SD630.  It is an extremely solid ultra compact, with performance and photo quality that more than make up for its very few design flaws.  It's a surprisingly good shooter, and its feature set makes it quite flexible for a camera of its size.  It is a more expensive version of the PowerShot SD600 ($50-100 more), with a larger screen and no optical viewfinder.  Personally, I don't use the viewfinder, so I am willing to give it up for the larger LCD.", "Date": "September 19, 2006"}, {"Title": "Crystal Clear Point and Shoot Memories", "Author": "B. B. \"BB\"", "ReviewID": "R1W5ZSN67TUCX3", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I borrowed my daughter's SD630 on a 10 day trip to Greece with some friends.  One of them had brought a new Canon EOS 5D but forgot to pack his flash (it doesn't have a pop up).  I had a scandisk ultra II 2G card but I was taking so many good shots, I had to download the photos each day onto my laptop which allowed us to compare the performances between SD630 and EOS 5D daily.  My SD630 took crystal clear shots just like the 5D (which retails for about $2,500??) on outdoor shots which is pretty remarkable but SD630 with High ISO (800) setting blew away the 5D on indoor shots.  During the trip, we visited many museums where flash photography was not allowed, and my SD630 was the only one in the group taking incredibly sharp pictures in low light situations with consistency.SD630 with its large LCD (which automatically switches between landscape and protrait in review mode) and easy to use thumb dial allowed me to take shots with great ease in changing conditions.  I was able to turn off the flash, set the ISO to high, and etc with ease that I was able to take shots so quickly where as a slower trigger might have missed the shot.I also tested out the macro settings where the SD630 performed flawlessly.It is small enough to fit in my palm while large enough for the trip of a life time.  Unlike SLR's, I was able to take the SD630 everywhere during the trip which meant I was merely a power button away from a great shot.  I was so impressed with the SD630, I finally chose Canon over Nikon in buying a SLR for myself.  I bought a new Rebel XTi with 18-55mm lens.  I do like the XTi's combination of versatility and functionality, but so far especialy on indoor shots where no flash is to be used, I am just amazed by the quiet and yet powerful performance of the SD630.  Maybe I just don't know how to use the XTi to its potential yet, but so far, I think the SD630 is taking better shots than the XTi or the 5D.  The pictures speak for themselves for me.  I don't think I will return the XTi, but seeing the photos, my wife is convinced that I am keeping the SLR because it is a \"cooler\" looking gadget than the point-and-shoot.  Deep down, I think she's right.  SD630 is a fantastic point-and-shoot camera which produces high end results.  As I use my new XTi on the next photo opportunities, I will be wondering if the shots will be coming out as good as the SD630 can produce.", "Date": "December 12, 2006"}, {"Title": "I think I'm in love!", "Author": "cherryosity \"roxyangel808\"", "ReviewID": "R25QP2JHHMGN9E", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "First of all, I am a Canon girl.  My first digicam was one of the first Digital Elphs on the market (the really thick ones).  When everyone was getting their Sony cybershots for Christmas, I bought a SD10 and everyone was jealous of it.  Then I moved on to the Canon digital rebel, but I was in the market for a new compact one.  I still love my SD10 as a compact camera, but I wanted one with more features.My first choice for my new digital camera was going to be the SD700.  I was determined to get it by the time I got to my local best buy.  The SD630 and the SD700 sat right next to each other in the display and the SD630 was the one that caught my eye.  I think it was the bigger screen. I wanted to play around with the SD700 a little bit, but it was not charged so I couldn't really get a feel for it.  But after going back and forth with the SD630 and the SD700, I decided on the SD630 for 2 reasons: (1) I didn't really need the stabilized zoom of the SD700.  (2) I liked the bigger screen of the SD630.  Those were pretty much the big differences between the two.

Of course there a few minor frustrations here and there, but nothing that wouldn't come with any typical snapshot camera.  Here are just some little things I'd like to point out:-Since only the 700 has the image stabilization feature, the 630 has a little blurring with shaky hands and action shots, but does well overall.  If you use the flash, it usually will eliminate the blur.-The sd630 does very well in dim lighting, as long as you have a sure hand.-The fireworks and color swap features really don't work THAT well, but they're fun to play around with.  A lot of the canon features make subtle differences though that only are noticable on a computer screen size--don't doubt that there's a difference!  A good example of this is the \"vivid\" color feature. The colors do not seem that different on the lcd screen, but on a computer screen, the color is gorgeous.-I would say that the enormous lcd screen makes the camera worth going for this over the 600, without a doubt.  Not only does the screen make it wonderfully easy to snap pictures, but the styling really separates this camera from the others in the line, or even other brands (notably, the sony cybershot).  I wouldn't normally care too much about the camera's appearance, but the sd630 offers great performance as well as a stylish look.  People often stop and comment at how much they like the camera. One note of warning-the screen is succeptible to scratches because of its size, so be sure to have a camera case.-How to handle the software: I was very annoyed when my pictures were downloaded and each day's pictures had their own file. If you would be annoyed with this as well, heed the following advice.  Because the software did that, this meant that I had about 20 different folders and could not look at my pictures that I'd taken in the past month all together.  My advice:when the download window comes up on your computer, choose the \"select images\" option.  This command will bring up another window, which you ought to choose \"select all images\" and then click \"download pictures\".  When the final window pops up, check the \"create subfolder\" option and choose \"new name\" from the list. This way, the pictures that you download all at once may be placed in one large folder under \"my pictures\" or wherever you have placed your pictures.  This really makes it much easier to view or show others pictures on the computer.-If you'd prefer to use the canon software, by all means, go ahead.  However, having used the canon software, I would advise downloading Picasa, Google's pciture software.  It's a free and wonderfully simple download and the software is infinitely better.  The only feature Picasa does not have is stitch assist, but for the ease of use, who cares?-The sd630 has many great options, like direct printing from the camera and slideshow mode.  Also, the 630 can erase all images at once, it is just a menu option.  Reviewing pictures with friends is delightfully easy, and you can zoom in very far, very quickly. The options for picturetaking are endless-you may choose the iso,  flash type, and even use digital macro along with other features.  The digital macro is amazing- you can come within centimeters of your subject.-The 630 is great for sharing your pictures with people because the camera is SO simple to figure out-no tricks.  One main button controls flipping between camera mode, picture taking, and reviewing.  Zooming is a breeze and no one ever questions which buttons to press to take a picture.  The buttons have been refined to a stylish few and are unobtrusive.  All are labeled, so there's no guesswork.  The picture taking options are under the menu option, and may be chosen on the screen--may be changed very quickly.  This eliminates the rotating button with confusing symbols like that of the sony cybershots.-Finally, and most importantly, the color and pictures are great.  Canon has a very distinguishable picture--the typical \"Canon color\" is meant to please the owner and it sure does.  The colors are bright and crisp.  The pictures are the true reward for owning this camera.", "Date": "July 13, 2006"}, {"Title": "I Love This Camera...", "Author": "gnapye", "ReviewID": "R2L86GJ1PJT8J3", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I purchased this camera when it was first released in anticipation of my upcoming summer trip to Europe. I upgraded to this 6MP Canon from my two and a half year old 5MP Sony DSC-P10, a camera that was becoming increasingly irritating both because of the small 1.5\" LCD screen and how long it took to take a simple photo.Let me tell you-- when I was traveling through Europe, I was so glad I had this camera.Not only did it take fantastic pictures, the 3\" LCD screen made it easier to see photos (although it was a little difficult in bright sunshine, a problem when I was in Greece) and decide whether or not I wanted to retake a particular picture. I loved all the different shooting options, and the color accent was particularly fun to play around with. It was a little more difficult taking pictures at night, and it would have helped if this camera had the image stablization that comes with the SD700 and now the SD800 as well. Both the optical and digital zoom were amazing, although using the digital zoom produces noisier pictures as expected.I also loved the navigation wheel on the camera, which functions almost like an iPod when you're scrolling through pictures. It made it easier to find the photo I wanted and fast! There's also a slideshow, which I used every night when reviewing my pictures from the day's adventures.I didn't mind that there was no viewfinder, because I never used it anyway. My biggest problem is that there is no battery indicator, so I was constantly nervously charging my battery at night when I was in hostels, just to be sure that it wouldn't die on me the next day. It was only a problem when I was in Paris and the battery died because I didn't charge it the previous night. I didn't take that many pictures a day, maybe 50-60 max daily, but I spent a lot of time playing around with the pictures after I took them, or just looking at them on the LCD screen later that night. I can't really comment on the battery life since I charged it almost every night while I was traveling, but it sure would have been useful to have a battery indicator to let me know how much was left. I would definitely recommend getting a backup battery, just in case.I definitely like this camera much more than my previous one. It's faster when taking pictures than the Sony ever was, and the screen makes it more enjoyable to take photos. My family has several digital cameras, and of all of the different brands we own I think that Canon is superior (vs. Olympus, Leica digital, and Nikon). This camera took a little getting used to when compared to the others, which I could simply take out of box, charge, and use. I had to read the manual to learn how to navigate through the menus, but it's easy to pick up and learn.All in all, this camera was well worth the money when I bought it over a hundred dollars more than it's listed for on Amazon now, so at the price it is now it's a bargain!", "Date": "November 19, 2006"}, {"Title": "3\" screen - not so excellent", "Author": "Ryan Miller", "ReviewID": "RVYSM6BFK5X", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "With all the praise this screen and this camera have gotten, I'd like to point out something that has been missing from any review I've seen.  While the screen is larger than it's 2.5\" counterparts, the pixel count is not (173,000 pixels for both).  Since the pixel density is even worse than my old 2\" screen camera, I cannot tell if my pictures are in focus in my camera!  I thought I had a defective unit that couldn't take sharp pictures until I uploaded them to my computer.

Ah, now for the Canon 630... while having a similar look and size, my pictures were vibrant and clear. Focus was tons better in both settings, Manual and Auto, however the Auto mode sometimes chooses the wrong point of the subject. The screen is a huge 3\" and I am worried that it will scratch easy...I suggest getting a clear screen protector. The metal brush on the body also scratches rather easy too. A true test is the quality of pictures regular people send in. I wish there was an battery indicator it appears close to when the battery is just about to run out. I don't mind that there was no viewfinder, you won't miss it. The flimsy battery/SD card door needs improvement. I suggest getting a Canon Accessory Kit 4, it comes with a leather case, Battery pack NB-4L and 2 straps all for about $45.In a nut shell this a GREAT POINT AND SHOOT CAMERA! For the price! I got it for $254 with 1 gb SD memory and shipping from Newegg. Most major chains sell it for $299 on sale.

The addition of the larger 3\" screen and a few other features unique to this model make it a very nice camera to keep in a shirt or jacket pocket.I especially like the new touch sensitive function selector which acts similarly to an iPod clickwheel.  Touching it causes a view of the wheel and its functions to appear on the screen so you can easily see what you're changing.  Its helpful in low-light conditions where the actual button markings may be hard to see.  The same selector also lets you scroll through your photos by twirling your finger around it.  Another nice new feature is the ability to get a picture-in-picture view of a photo after its taken.  In this view, the whole photo appears in the upper left of the screen and the focus point appears enlarged in the lower right allowing verification that it was in focus.Contrary to an earlier review here, and to the instructions, it doesn't seem necessary to load the Canon software.  Windows XP seems to already have adequate drivers to allow photos to be downloaded from Windows Explorer.

Of course, there are a lot of reviews helping you to chose the proper one, but too keep things as simple as possible, this is how to find a proper Canon pocket size camera.Basically, there are 2 lines: AXXX and SDXXX. The A line is using 2 AA size batteries and the SD one has a custom one. That makes the SD cameras a bit thinner. The other specs are pretty much the same and for every A one there is a similar SD sibling. Another difference is 3x zoom for SDXXX vs 4x zoom for AXXX, but this is rarely a showstopper.Since size was the most important, I focused on the SD line.2 biggest factors to consider are the MegaPixels and optical viewfinder.I've been using a 6MP SLR for long time and never felt being limited, so unless you're doing something special, anything starting at 6MP should be ok for general purpose pocket camera. The megapixels are becoming cheaper every year and I economically it doesn't make sense to buy the latest model because the price/value ration is better for a bit older (but not real old) cameras.Optical viewfinder. There is a choice you need to made between having a bigger LCD screen and having an optical viewfinder. It's a personal preference. An optical viewfinder in old days could help to extend some battery life and was useful in bright sunlight, when LCD was not easy to see. But these days the battery lasts long and the LCDs are bright and fast, so pick what you want.At this time, this camera is probably the best value for it's price in Canon campact camera product line. 6MP, slim case, an optical viewfinder are specific for this model. But as pretty much any Canon it produces really great pictures, easy to use etc. If you're willing to pay more, you can find fancier models, but this is a good solid work horse pocket cam you can feel confident about.I've been using it for a few weeks and haven't got any reasons to complain.

I basically just throw it in my purse and GO! It does not take up a lot of room and it is really light, so you don't even notice it's there.AWESOME features! Some of the really fun features about this camera is the fact that you can single out a color in a picture. For instance, I took a picture of my friend Jason and just singled out the green (the color of his shirt), his shirt is green and the rest of the picture is black and white. REALLY color feature. You can also color swap. If you want someone with blue eyes to have green eyes, you can change that color in the picture. The features on this camera are VERY cool. One thing that you have to worry about is that you have to have a steady hand when in those two picture taking modes. For some reason, the pictures are not quite as clear and be fuzzy easier. It is ONLY in those two modes that happens. So, if you do not plan on getting all techie with the camera or using those modes A LOT, it shouldn't make a difference.There really isn't too much that I can say that is negative about this camera.

The size is awesome, I can place it anywhere I'd like.  With a three inch LCD, who needs a view finder - does anyone still use a view finder?  It offers a lot of scene modes and they are not that difficult to get to, it just takes a little time to get used to the buttons.  The 6.0 megapixel and 3x optical zoom and UA lens is all you need.  This Elph now offers a new ISO 800, which reduces image blur and expands low-light shooting ability.  It's camera solution CD-ROM software has improved a lot, so it's easier to download, edit, and view your pictures.Cons: It's features are a bit basic but it offers just enough for those point and shot customers.  So if you want a lot of manual features you might want to pay more for another camera.  The LCD might get thumbprints very easily but I have one word for you: invisibleSHIELD.  Amazons might sell one for this camera, if not, do a web search.  It doesn't come with a case or bag; the manual is boring and just like all the others - you may need to buy a book if photography is a hobby for you.  The Function/Set buttons might be too small, but I have small hands so I'm cool with their size.Conclusion: The Canon PowerShot SD630 is an solid ultracompact camera, with performance and photo quality that more than make up for its few design flaws and it's price. It's a good shooter, and its feature set makes it quite flexible for a camera of its size. That said, it's basically a more expensive version of the PowerShot SD600 with a larger screen and no optical viewfinder.", "Date": "January 30, 2007"}, {"Title": "A little pricey but worth it!!", "Author": "Alyssa A. Lofgren", "ReviewID": "RH560WKH65QXJ", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I am one of those people that obsessively researches reviews and ratings on an electronic item before I buy it - So I spent a very long time trying to decide between the Casio Exilims, Canon Sd630, 600 and 700. I finally decided on the SD630 because I loved the styling and design of it. Although it lacks a view finder, the huge screen more than makes up for it. I wanted a bigger zoom but was having trouble finding a camera with more than 3x for less than $300. I finally bought the Canon Sd630 and I LOVE IT! I brought it on a cruise and the image clarity is beautiful, the design is stunning and the battery life is wonderful. I used this camera off and on for 3 days and the battery is still not eaten up. People will ooh and aah when they see you pull this baby out! I got a case logic case at target for 3.99 and I loved how tiny this camera is. The menu settings are super easy to use, and you get up to an 800 ISO! that is insane for such a teeny camera, and all of the extra settings like fireworks, beach, night, kids, pets, insects, are all very cool. I used to have a Sony DSC something and the SD630 is by far a million times better. Color settings are awesome such as color swap, and it really is cool how you can tilt the camera from side or bottom and it flips the picture to accomodate the screen. My only negative about this camera is pictures taken with the digital zoom are grainy (but that happens with any camera). If you want a sleek little camera with alot of manual control, I recommend this one. You will not be disappointed - after seeing this camera, my mother (who is a professional wedding photographer and uses the big league Canon Elans and 5D/20D) decided she wanted one for her birthday!! GO FOR IT!!Updated after 3 weeks of owning it: WOW! I am super-impressed with the battery life. I went to San Francisco for a weekend and forgot my charger - I used the camera constantly for 3 days straight and the battery was fine until the morning I left to go home (4th day) and I was looking thru all my pics for the millionth time!)

Canon cameras are excellent - we owned the SD410 for a few years and took wonderful photos with it.  The SD630 greatly improves on what is already a great line of point of shoot cameras.  It is pretty amazing how many features they can pack into these tiny cameras.  Some highlights:*The first thing you'll notice is the beautiful 3\" LCD.  It absolutely great to see the images right on your camera - and @ 3\", you notice a lot more details than you do on smaller screens.  In playback mode, there are some neat slideshow settings you can use to check out your photos.*The other huge upgrade on this camera is the ISO 800 shutter speed.  This very fast shutter speed gives you the ability to take awesome indoor photos without the flash.  One benefit of no flash = no red eye.  Red eye is always going to be an issue shooting indoor photos and using the flash - this camera helps to alleviate the red eye problem as it gives you the speed you need to shoot without the flash.  The fast shutter speed also allows for crisp images even when holding the camera by hand (no tripod).  I shot a few test images (auto ISO setting) in a dimly lit room w/out the flash and the images came out awesome.*This camera is so easy to operate as a point and shoot (auto mode will work for the majority of shots), but for the serious (or quasi serious) photographer, this camera has additional shooting modes (e.g. portrait, kids & pets, nighttime, indoor, landscape, digital macro, etc...) and manual settings galore.  Even includes long shutter mode, self timer, and movie mode - that is also greatly improved from SD410.We prefer this very compact camera as it is easy to carry anywhere - especially hikes, day trips, etc...  We took our old SD410 to Belize, Yosemite, Niagara, etc... and have beautiful photos to show off.  Definitely small enough for a purse or pants pocket.  This camera only has 3x optical zoom - so if you want more zoom (shooting sports, etc...), consider a larger camera (like Canon's S2).  We keep the digital zoom turned off as it reduces your image quality.  You will definitely need a larger memory card.  Get @ least 512 MB and more (like 1 - 2 GB) if you plan to use your camera for movies.  No case included - we opted not to buy the accessory pack, because the camera case looked bulky.  We prefer a small case that fits snug on the camera so we can 'stay light'.  We found some great cases that did the trick by going to Wolf Camera.  Take your camera with you when you go so you can try the cases out to see how they work for your needs.Canon makes a phenomenal product and this one is no exception.

The only issue that I would have with the screen is that it has a potential to be screatched. However, that can easily be remidied with a simple screen kit. Also, night shots are hard to get and sometimes the motion blurs when you take the pictures. However, that can be remedied by just taking an .AVI of the shot and separating it into others. My advice is to play with the camera to get ALL of its idosyncrasies, but that would be for any camera. However, the camera interface is EXTREMELY intuitive. Also, set up the software to automatically align shots. You can do that in camera, but for vertical shots, it may not do that and you'd have to save it in the same file.", "Date": "November 12, 2006"}, {"Title": "Envy of the office", "Author": "Vince \"Deal Finder\"", "ReviewID": "R2ISFW3NUSEYC", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Let me just start by saying that I made a point to read all of the reviews listed here in regard to this camera, sorting them by negatives first, before I made my decision to purchase. I am glad I did not allow the negatives to sway my decision. I am not necessarily a professional photographer - no - but I have used many cameras (both good and bad) andI know the difference between a quality point and shoot and a hunk of [insert word here].This camera is a great buy. I am really impressed with its design and its functionality. Its got plenty of really cool features the first time camera buyer is going to get butterflies over, and many features the serious camera buyer will appreciate as well. The screen is huge; amazing color with lots of viewing area to scrutinize what you captured and to show your friends and co-workers (who will inevitably be peering over your shoulder). I did not find the buttons too small (I have big fingers), but then I like things compact.Too many features to list, but plenty of decision making room for any lighting situation; and you certainly can't beat the macro function. Also color accent feature is really inspiring as it allows even the most novice of photographers to create artistic shots.This camera lists itself as a combination of 12X zoom, but 3X is optical and 4X is digital, so it really is a 3X zoom, because we all know that digital zoom is completely horrid and coarse.Video - amazing for a camcorder, much less a camera! When using the \"fast frame rate\" mode with video set to 640 X 480 at 30 fps, you'll think the clip was taken with a high end video camera. Need at least a gig SD card, though.By the way, the only review that worried me was the one about the consistent blurry pictures and the frustrations some where having with getting really crisp pictures. I will say this camera is sensitive to movement and to lighting conditions, but I did not experience the degree of frustration others seem to have had. First - remember to press the capture button halfway to lock in focus (it will beep) then all the way to take the picture. Also, if you have the camera set to auto (without a flash) and its somewhat dark (dimly lit room/nighttime) then the shutter will snap slower which captures more movement. So, rule of thumb - if you are taking a picture at night without a flash, use a tripod. Other than that, check your settings and make sure the resolution is set to 1600 X 1200 or higher. Otherwise you'll be trying to zoom in on it when you download to your computer and that causes graininess.Hey, I took a chance and I'm extremely happy.

(It seems like I had good timing, since apparently it is now discontinued?)It seems to have way more features than I'll ever need, but I'm happy they're there, since I hope to become a more sophisticated picture-taker over time.Major downsides:1. Price. There are definitely comparable cameras out there that are cheaper. In the end I decided to splurge, figuring if its well-made then I'll have it for a while and the investment will be worth it.2. 3\" LCD. Looks great, your friends will definitely be jealous. But the resolution is no better than on Canon's 2.5\" LCD, and it shows. They really should have made it sharper. The screen is visibly pixelated.3. Weight. Seems a little heavy, but maybe that's just the trade-off for having what seems to be a very well-made, high-quality camera.I can't really comment on picture quality since I'm a novice.

I held out for a long time, did lots of research and for the price, I think this camera is just great.  I've had it for 3 weeks and I've been having a lot of fun playing with it.  The pictures are clear and sharp, the video is better than I expected and there are lots of shooting mode choices for different conditions.  It's just important to try it out before any kind of important event to see what modes work best in what lighting and distance conditions.Besides the auto mode, I especially like the digital macro mode.  I haven't had any battery life problems, but I also haven't taken it away on a trip.  I originally thought I would have a problem with the controls because it is so small, but after a couple of hours playing with it, I don't have any problems with them at all.  I don't miss the viewfinder, though I know that might be a problem for some people. One of its many interesting features is one that allows you to tell if the focus is good of the shot you just took.  I've found that helpful.  Also, the Canon software is very user friendly. It not only allows you to download the pictures, but to do rudimentary edits with the video and add titles and transitions.  It doesn't conflict with my Photoshop Elements and I was pleasantly surprised at how much I use it.Finally, from a style point of view, the camera is really sleek and cute, and with the red Canon case I bought as an accessory, I'm the envy of all my friends when I whip it out. If you're an inexperienced photographer and have problems with camera shake, you might want to spend more for a higher model that has image stabilization and more sophisticated bells and whistles.

Slow shutter speed may not be a problem when you are using a tripod, but when you're photographing, for example, children and pets who move very quickly, or other scenes with rapid change, this camera's shutter is just too slow.

The control buttons are well placed, and do not hinder the view nor get in the way (it's probably a good thing Canon is used to putting the zoom up front).This has everything you'd expect from Canon: quality build; quality zoom (3x); and fast, quality processing of images.  The battery power is very good (and stable), and keeping in mind the idea of a travel camera, the battery charger is equally small and easy to carry.Typical of most Powershots, Canon also doesn't go into too many extras (some might say frills) in the menu options.  Post in-camera editing, for example, is not as strong as those found in the Nikon Coolpix line.

It has a sensor that detects if a photo was taken in landscape or portrait mode and it automatically flips the picture.  No more flipping for me!  This also means the photo is right-side up when you view it on the camera.  This works well with the nice slideshow the camera offers, with nice transitions and subtle panning.It loses a star because there is no optical viewfinder...but hey, you can't have everything.", "Date": "July 17, 2006"}, {"Title": "Canon SD630", "Author": "M.

Price", "ReviewID": "RHQP7FEPYL20N", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "First of all, I've owned several Canon PowerShots, way back to the S10 when memory cards were like $50 for 32 megs. Except for one, the SD450, the image quality has been excellent on all of them. Canon's are known for their image quality and this one holds true to that. The downside to all the PowerShots prior to this one has been how awfully slow they were in taking shots, especially in low light or at night. The delay from the time you push the button to the camera actually snapping the shot could be excruciatingly slow and infuriating. I absolutely loved my S400 in every way except for how freaking slow it was in snapping shots. I couldn't tell you how many shots I have of my dog's butt/tail because I didn't properly point the camera 10 feet in front of her and take the shot just right to account for that horrible delay.Finally, a Canon PowerShot that is quick! There are some shots that aren't quite lightning fast in lower light, but this is expected and the performance is FAR better than any other Canon I've owned. The SD450 had decent performance, but the picture quality was subpar.Another problem I've always had is poor battery life. This one can take about 200 shots before needing to be recharged. Compared to my last camera (the SD450), that's about 3 times as many shots. So the battery life is much improved.On a side note, another problem I've had which most ppl would probably not notice is a few dead pixels showing up over time. Canon seems to have fixed that in the last couple generation of PowerShots and it isn't an issue with this one.I like the fact that it has no viewfinder, who uses that thing anyway? The screen is huge but the resolution is not any better than my old S400 with a tiny 1.8\" screen so all shots look kind of fuzzy. I very rarely have a shot out of focus with this camera so I don't worry about it. Besides, regardless of screen size or resolution it is going to be really hard to tell if a shot is a little bit out of focus and you'd have to zoom in to tell anyway.All in all, this is a great camera and the best PowerShot I've owned to date.

Does what it suppose to do! Fast start up time and shooting.  I did months of research on point and shoot digital cameras and narrowed it down to Canon PowerShot SD 630 and the Canon PowerShot SD 700 IS.  I like the idea of Image Stabilization but that additional feature was a bit pricey.  I decided to buy the SD 630 instead b/c it has a 3 inch LCD screen  (Who really uses viewfinders nowadays) and bought a 133x speed Lexar Professional SD 1 GB memory card.  This card is excellent in holding the camera's videos and super high resolutions photos including 16:9 widescreen shots.  The video capture on this camera is great feature as well.  Of course there is a lot of noise in low lighting situation but remember, this is a camera, not a camcorder.I justified getting this camera (that does not have image stabilization) and use it together with a monopod/tripod for stable shots.  My only complaint would be better improvement on the battery/memory card compartment door.  The door can easily slide open by acccident when pulling the camera in and out of your pocket.  But overall, the Canon Powershot SD 630 is a killer camera!!!! It totally rocks!!! $339 on Amazon.com . I can't keep my hands off this camera!", "Date": "June 30, 2006"}, {"Title": "What a disappointment...", "Author": "rainyjewels", "ReviewID": "R2MRK6JO9BYDB3", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I don't know how long I've been looking forward to the release of SD630 - perhaps from January on, when Canon first introduced it. It seemed to be flawless, and perhaps the most gorgeously stunning camera to have ever existed. When I finally got it, and started taking pictures with it, I was severely disappointed. 90% of the pictures I took were blurry. At first, I thought, perhaps indoors is just too little lighting, so I constantly played with all the settings on the camera. The only way to eliminate the blurriness was to turn on flash, but Canon's flash technology causes either 1) the object in visual field to be blasted with light and rest of the background is totally dark OR 2) pixelation of the entire image and untrue color reproduction. To be optimistic - because I was so in love with the look of this camera - I blamed all the poor quality pictures on the fact that I was indoors. I took the camera outside, where there was plenty of light and no need for flash. I set everything on auto - STILL blurry. I set settings to manual, and played with settings - STILL blurry. The best photo I got was when most of the photo was clear but the sides would be blurry. Again, yes every 20 photos maybe I would get 1 or 2 good, clear ones. In those pictures, you can tell that Canon photograph image quality is just superior. However, it is way too difficult to take those perfect pictures. Cnet reviews claim that at ISO 80, pictures are crisp and clear. Under low light conditions, with ISO 80, you will not be able to see anything. Cnet says as ISO settings increase, pictures will become noisy but not \"unusable\"...meaning, in low light, pictures will be blurry and noisy unless you use flash, which then causes untrue color reproduction and sense of artificial lighting. Essentially, when flash is on, no matter how hard you shake the camera, all your pictures will be crisp and clear. If flash is NOT on, even if you sincerely try your best to hold the camera still, 10% of the pictures are crisp and clear. Why does flash make this difference? Something is clearly wrong with this camera's technology.Perhaps you're thinking, nah everyone seems to love this camera - this girl is just bad at taking pictures. I thought the same thing before I got this camera, when I read reviews complaining about the SD630's lack of image stabilization technolgy and blurry pictures. I ignored them. I exchanged this camera many times, thinking perhaps I got a bad model. I played with all the settings. Took it indoors, outdoors, set it on Auto, set it on Manual....I can't say I've gotten one fantastic picture out of it yet. I thought, maybe it's just me. I asked many people to try taking pictures of the same item with this camera, including a professional photographer, and out came the same blurry pictures. One caveat: the \"blurriness\" I'm referring to is not severe, where you can't even tell what's in the picture. I'm referring to the fact that the pictures simply have no sharpness or clarity. I can send pictures illustrating this to anyone interested.No matter how hard I've tried to be optimistic or make this camera take some high-quality pictures, I find that the quality and image technology really hasn't improved since the earlier Canon models (I've taken pictures with many earlier models). There is no way that auto settings and image quality set at \"fine\" would turn out so pixelated and not have true color. Even though it's going to be so much trouble and cost me excessively to return it at this point, I would rather not own ANY digital camera than spend over 300 on such a disappointing machine. Canon needs to catch up with its competitors; the fact that the first digital elph with image stabilization is the SD700 shows how behind Canon is.Bottom line - people who only care about vanity would love this camera. It looks simply stunning. Those with any relatively high standards for image quality and consistency thereof, i.e. those who do not want a huge proportion of their photos to be just okay and not \"unusable,\" should look elsewhere. And if any of you find the perfect one, do let me know; I've been in search of the perfect camera this whole time and disappointingly, this camera falls way below that ideal.", "Date": "July 2, 2006"}, {"Title": "Broken upon arrival.", "Author": "DECC", "ReviewID": "R32BBT8QPXHVZE", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "This camera is a great camera.
