{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Good enough", "Author": "J. Eaves \"mother of 4\"", "ReviewID": "R1A1VTVD4E0IR5", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "we got this system for our home. The installation is easy enough if you dont mind taking lots of time running the cords so you dont run them over with a lawnmower or weed eater lol. Make sure you have long enough cords. And if you have to buy extra, you need to buy the adapters that connect them together. I suggest getting a wireless system if you dont have a lot of time or no one else to run the cords for you. The set up is easy to understand however. The picture quality is ok. Not the best but it works good enough. The night vision is ok too. Does the job. The dvr is hard to learn how to use. Now that I looked around I think I could have gotten it a little cheaper somewhere else. Oh well, we needed it asap.", "Date": "May 27, 2011"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": "$2,449.95", "Features": "Bullet IR camera Feature: Color CCD Image Sensor, 420 TV Lines video quality, 6.0mm Lens, 24 infrared LEDs for night vision\nDome camera feature: Color CCD image sensor, 420 TV Lines video quality, 3.6mm wide angle lens\nStand Alone DVR supports live video, parameter setting and copy playback video via network\n1500GB network digital video recorder Hard Drive\nPackage including: 2 IR color CCD bullet outdoor security cameras, 2 color CCD mini-dome camera, 1 (4 channel) network digital video recorder with 1500 GB hard drive, 1 (12 Volt DC) power supply for 4 cameras, 3 pack power video cables,1 pack audio video power cable, 1 Pre-Amp mini hidden microphone", "Name": "VideoSecu 4 Channel Audio Video H.264 Network DVR Stand Alone Real Time Digital Video Recorder Security Surveillance Camera System with 1500GB/1.5TB 3.5\" SATA Hard Drive, 2 Night Vision IR Color 6mm Lens CCD Outdoor Bullet Security Cameras, 2 Mini-Dome 3.6mm Lens CCD Surveillance CCTV Camera, 4 Pack Security Camera Extension Cables, 1 Pre-Amp Mini Hidden Microphone, One 4 Channel Power Supply for Cameras 1VI", "ImgURL": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51KAmW6vMBL._SY300_.jpg", "ProductID": "B002VUV47K"}}
