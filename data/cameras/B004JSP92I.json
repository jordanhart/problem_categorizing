{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Good adventure cam, especially for the price.", "Author": "R. Zamudio", "ReviewID": "R3MAINL78HRKKQ", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I almost did not buy this camera, having read the reviews from my phone while standing in the store aisle. I figured I would give it a try and return it if I ran into the same problems. I was looking for a camera with adventure-oriented toughness at a reasonable price, and this is one of the few on the market. It seems as if most consumers are ignoring the cardinal rule regarding use of technology: You have to be \"smarter\" than the device you are attempting to use.The most frequent complaint I have read is on the claim of the camera being waterproof. In response to this, I purposely pushed this camera to it's rated limit of 16 ft depths several times during scuba training and snorkeling trips without issue. I have owned $1400 diving cameras with waterproof housings, and this one takes shots and video at shallow depths just as good as the more expensive models, and without the bulkiness of a waterproof housing. I also realize how important the seals are on an underwater camera, so I regularly clean the seals at the battery compartment and apply a bit of chap stick with my pinky to keep a good pliable seal. But since this is not a full-blown underwater camera, it requires some careful handling. If you remember from middle-school science class, pressure is a measurement of force, and this camera is rated at depths where the force of water acting on the camera is roughly 7 pounds per sq. inch. This means that if the camera is exposed to a force of water greater than 7 PSI, chances are the seals will be overwhelmed and fail. This can happen while trying to take this camera surfing and having a wave crash on top of you. This can happen if you were to drop it off of a fairly high bridge into water. It can happen if it is in your pocket when you are in water and your movements are trapping and forcing water against the camera. It can happen if you are going down a fast slide at a waterpark with the camera and hit the splashdown pool with speed. This is a sensitive electronic device, and should be treated as such within what the manufacturer recommends. With this being said, the camera has worked great for me in aqueous situations. The neoprene case that was included with mine acts as a flotation device for the camera. The camera by itself will not float, but I have seen a floating wrist strap for sale that should do the trick.I have not dropped it with the exception of it sliding off of the countertop and hitting the tile, and it still works. I guess this is not bad, considering other cameras and even higher-end mobile electronics like iPhones have sustained irreparable damage from falls of less severity.I would say the dustproof claim falls under the same claim of waterproof since it relies on the same seals. Havent had to test it, but it is nice to be able to just rinse the entire camera under a faucet when it starts getting grimey. Just don't plan on dragging this behind a dune buggy and having a functioning camera.The freezeproof claim is based upon battery type, which in this case is a Lithium-ion type. Lithium-based batteries are lighter than most other battery types and have greater resistance to cold. Cold temps slow the chemical reaction in batteries and causes a drop in output until they are warmed. For this reason, I use lithium-based batteries in my headlamps for hiking in cold weather. Another bonus to Lithium-ion batteries is that they last very long and do not develop a charge-memory that can cause a drop in overall charge capacity.Picture quality is very good for a point-and-shoot. I do not use the full 14MP quality in my photos because I frequently send photos through emails, and the size of 14MP photos would clog people's inboxes and take too long to upload and download. (Grandma, get Cable. Dial-up sucks!) Even at mid-quality settings, the photos are still more than good enough to take to Costco and have made into enlarged prints. Mind you, the \"intelligent\" settings on most cameras cannot make up for common sense of the user. If it is dark out, and the intelligent setting is trying to use \"face\" mode or anything other than \"night\" mode, it would probably be best to override the settings manually. Don't blame the camera completely for lousy shots in lousy conditions if you do not notice it is in a mode not suited for those conditions.In conclusion, this is a great camera that can take a bit more abuse than others on the market and has great picture quality, all for under two hundred dollars. It is nice to have a point and shoot camera that; won't be totalled by accidently falling in while crossing a river or stream, isn't at the mercy of the couple grains of sand jamming the protruding lens assembly, and won't have a near-dead battery on the slopes of a snowy mountain. As for extreme action sports in similar elements, you will most likely want a camera that has a separate housing to provide water and shock protection.", "Date": "August 14, 2011"}, {"Title": "Works fine so far. Nice pictures and vide", "Author": "khp", "ReviewID": "R1VYW35NNDCE0U", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "After ruining 2 digital cameras on outdoor trips. One was sat on and one drowned under my raingear I decided to get a rugged waterproof camera for around use.  I looked at all the reviews for these type of cameras. I was looking at the Pentax wp90 and the Panasonic TS2.  I really wanted the Pentax WP90 but there was a lot of complaining about the image quality from the reviews.  Then I looked at the Panasonic TS2 and the reviews all said great things about the images but I could not find one anywhere online for a good price.  I finally was sick of reading reviews and hunting for cameras online and went to the nearest Costco and picked up a Fuji film XP20.  I figured the price was right and I had 90 days to return it if I didn't like it.  I just wanted a rugged point and shoot camera that can survive hiking, canoeing, and skiing.  I don't plan on swimming with it.  First day with it and I'll happy with this camera.  Pictures and videos are great.  Easy to use. Quick to get pictures.  Kind of tricky to hold but still a fine camera so far. Time will tell how rugged it is but the images are good enough for me.", "Date": "April 12, 2011"}, {"Title": "Audio is out-of-sync", "Author": "H. Wang \"jwangamazon\"", "ReviewID": "R1E7KA3525SVR9", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "I got the Fuji XP20 mainly for taking videos in conditions that my Canon HD camcorder can not. On my first usage in a river rafting event, I already see the problems with this camera:1) I am experienced with Camera and camcorders, I know how to hold them properly. But the lens head is placed in a very awkward place, your fingers will easily cover part of the lens head. So, don't be surprised to see your fingers in the final photos and video clips. It's almost for sure that you will not get photos or videos of yourself. Because other people may not be able to hold this camera properly to take yours.2) Hard to fine tune the zoom speed. Not convenient, but I can live with that.3) The camera won't focus while zooming (it will focus after zooming stops). This is a typical issue with non-DSLR camera in video mode. I saw the same thing in Panasonic camera also. Not a big issue to me.4) This is the biggest flaw, the audio is not in sync with the video. I have to turn off the audio from the video clips, and add background music when producing the final movie for the rafting trip. Even my simple Flip video camera handle this better than this Fuji camera.5) The video quality is no way to compare with regular HD camcorder. The image is kind of grainy, even at 1pm strong sunshine with good light. Again, I can accept this since I am in a condition (around water) where normal camcorder can not be used.6) Indoor photo quality is no way to compare with my 5-year-old 5MP Panasonic camera.But this is OK to me since I am in a condition (around water) where my normal camera can not be used.If this is the only camera you want to have, I won't recommend this. However, if your intend is \"ONLY\" to take photos, videos in conditions where your normal gears can not, then I think this Fuju XP20 is acceptable....if you don't mind the out-of-sync audio problem.", "Date": "July 5, 2011"}, {"Title": "Not for surfing (nor maybe ANY action water sport)", "Author": "Nicholas P. Kiefer \"keefah\"", "ReviewID": "R2K2WR57TJTVAZ", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "Everything about this camera makes you want to buy it -- price (Costco discount), the durability/waterproof aspect, style... then you get it home and everything seems cool -- take a few shots around the house, video your dog. Very good image quality. So next step -- take it out to do what you bought it for: water/action/rugged whatever. I took mine surfing today, first time. I read all the precautions about how to keep water out, particularly the part where the battery is housed. First thing I noticed is the strap is not meant for a water sport at all! Why didn't they include some kind of cool floating and/or rubber strap that would allow it to stay on you while you paddle or whatever? Ok, so I'm navigating the dopey regular strap, take a few shots, but then I start to realize that the button positioning and sensitivity make trying to hold it and navigate waves just stupid. It is very easy to accidentally press buttons you don't intend to, and there is no \"normal\" way to hold it for shooting pictures, let alone action pictures. I took a bunch of unintended videos too. The clincher was when the cover housing the battery popped open! Oops, water in the camera, game over! If this battery cover that absolutely cannot be allowed to get wet can POP OPEN during water action activity...?? Screw that! So I'm taking it back to Costco today. Fortunately, I found this out during my first 30 days. I'm going to exchange it and try again, giving the benefit of the doubt that this was a bad apple, but I'm still kind of turned off by the design and button sensitivity. I guess it was more made for Moms and kids at the beach as opposed to actual water sports. Oh well. I was actually able to salvage the sd card and look at the photos. Very nice image quality, I will give it that, though many of them have water dropplets in the shot (not sure how to prevent that). Video quality very nice, with sound too. I'd say fine as long as you aren't really going to be \"rugged\" with it at all.", "Date": "May 19, 2011"}, {"Title": "xp20 self destructs!", "Author": "Zaxxon", "ReviewID": "R3RNRD0FRFPURN", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "Like another reviewer my battery cover popped open underwater! Not cool for an \"underwater\" camera.  The two tiny 'latch' sliders on the xp20 (one is the actual 'open' slider the other is apparently the 'lock' - the manual states both have to be set snugly against the 'closed' edge - but they are suffiently exposed to cause some slight friction to allow the hatch to literally 'spring' open) are a change from the arrangement on the xp10, not a good redesign in my estimation, after a over a hundred hours of underwater videos on the xp10 vs. less than an hour with the xp20 before the hatch opened and the camera self destructed.  I bought this as a 'refurbished' unit online thru ebay, we'll see if anyone along the line is going to be 'accountable'.  The picture quality underwater in 720p is very good, I like Fuji camera products, but this design needs to be rethought.  If you buy one of these units, buy it from a local outlet so you can return it in person should the latch failure occur.  The design of the battery/sd card 'hatch' cover makes this unit a very questionable buy if your intent is underwater shooting - good luck!", "Date": "August 12, 2011"}, {"Title": "Bang for the Buck", "Author": "Robert M", "ReviewID": "R2UMCEN1BQUBPP", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I have had this for a couple of weeks now.  This is a great little camera for the price.  Takes really good photos, small enough to fit into your pocket or life vest, or jacket.  Battery was charged when I first got it and it still shows completely charged even after taking some video, and about 100 photos.  I dropped it from 5 ft onto the concrete and watched it bounce, thinking there went $100 down the drain, and it was alive and kicking, not a scratch on it.  Plunked it into water and took a photo with it.  The only down side, so far, is the SD card is hard to retrieve with the battery in, but easy to put back in with the battery in.  Controls are easy to get to.  A little to easy, I have hit the video button more than once by accident.  I got this for kayaking and outdoors stuff and it fits right into the kayak LJ and is hardly noticeable in my shorts pockets.  2 thumbs up.  I had looked at more expensive ones, on review sites, and I am so far very glad I bought this.

I love the picture quality of this camera an the video quality.  On the Fourth of July though, I accidently dropped it two feet from the ground on carpet with the extra protection the rubber piece in the accessory kit it's supposed to give, and the dang thing broke. So much for shockproof.

I wanted a camera that would shoot decent still photos and videos, but could withstand a little dunking in the wilderness.  Ironically, I never got to take this camera to Alaska as intended.When I first got this camera, I wanted to see how well it took photos underwater.  So, on only two occasions, holding the camera just below the surface of waist-deep water, I took a couple of photos of the bottom of a swimming pool.  The photos were satisfactory, but not outstanding.  Those were the only times that the camera was ever underwater.  It never even got rained on.  I simply used it to take \"everyday\" snapshots.  Again, the only time this camera has touched water was two years ago.A few weeks ago, I attempted to change the battery, but the latch on the battery/SD card cover would not work.  It seemed that the spring was broken, and the latch could not be opened.  I sent the camera to the FujiFilm repair center in New Jersey for what seemed to be a simple repair.Within a week, I received a written estimate for repair for the camera.  The estimated cost of repair was precisely $6.00 less than what I paid for the camera brand-new!  The estimate stated that not only was the latch broken, but the \"camera has WATER DAMAGE (capitalization added) and is beyond repair!\"  Where did the water damage come from?The user's manual was very careful to point out that the cover for the battery compartment needed to be pressed tightly with the tip of your finger until a second \"click\" was heard to ensure proper closure.  Accordingly, I made sure that I heard that \"click\" each time I closed the cover.  And, as far as I could tell, until the latch wouldn't open, the camera was working just fine.To have Fuji tell me that there was catastrophic water damage when the camera has not touched water in two years is extremely disappointing!  Basically, it tells me that this camera does not perform as it was intended.  It also tells me that, whatever method they're using, Fuji's waterproofing is inadequate or substandard.  To repeat, WHERE did the water damage come from?To be fair, I found the camera to be small and handy and fine to take point-and-shoot snapshots.But, I will not buy another FujiFilm \"waterproof\" camera, and I cannot, in good conscience, recommend that anyone else do so.

Zamudio, \"Good adventure cam, especially for the price. August 14, 2011.\"This is actually my second XP20. I lost the first one in a wave while filming first-person videos of bodyboarding at Venice Beach. Definitely, an investment in a brightly colored flotation device or a more secure strap would be a wise choice if you're planning to take the camera into less than crystal clear waters. And as you can see, I liked the XP20 so much and had such great results with it in pools and surf (and on dry land) that I purchased my second one.After two years of trustworthy perfomance, the second XP20 ended up waterlogged with water visibly sloshing around in the display screen and fogging up the lens--when I opened the battery hatch, a stream of water poured out. The camera is now sitting with both hatches (the battery and USB) open in the hopes that it will be salvageable, but with a dried up residue on the inner side of the lens, it's not looking very good. The SD card is also drying out and I'm hoping to be able to access the last photos/videos taken. The battery looks fine (hopefully the newer Fujifilm XPs are using the same battery... the more extreme XP200 makes me drool).This review was actually going to be a 3-star or less review, but then I remembered that I had been diving down to depths that were possibly below 16 feet and the R. Zamudio review explained the other extreme conditions that I ignorantly inflicted upon the camera.\"I also realize how important the seals are on an underwater camera, so I regularly clean the seals at the battery compartment and apply a bit of chap stick with my pinky to keep a good pliable seal.\" --R. ZamudioIn the two years I have had the camera, I never cleaned/lubricated the seals. They were starting to look kinda dry, and I would occasionally see very light moisture around the inside of the hatches of the battery-USB compartments, but it never affected the XP20's performance, so I continued using it as usual.\"This means that if the camera is exposed to a force of water greater than 7 PSI, chances are the seals will be overwhelmed and fail. This can happen while trying to take this camera surfing and having a wave crash on top of you. This can happen if you were to drop it off of a fairly high bridge into water. It can happen if it is in your pocket when you are in water and your movements are trapping and forcing water against the camera. It can happen if you are going down a fast slide at a waterpark with the camera and hit the splashdown pool with speed.\" -- R. ZamudioAaahhh! The brain light finally switched on... these are exactly the conditions I have been using to abuse my poor XP 20. Flipping off diving boards with it, bodysurfing/bodyboarding, and the action that finally killed my XP20, jumping off a 16 foot cliff into a pool of more or less the same depth of flowing waterfall run-off. I jumped multiple times with the camera in my hands and/or pocket. By the time I realized something was wrong, water was sloshing around the display and the lens was fogged up.The XP20 survived everything else up to this point. Because of reviews I had read 2 years ago (before R. Zamudio's), I was always careful to check the seals and make sure the hatch buttons were always clicked tightly upwards. I only worried about exceeding the depth rating and was completely ignorant of water impact pressures.Would I purchase the XP20 again? Sure, if it was the only model available, but after seeing the 49.2' rated XP200 (placing a mug under my lips to capture the drool), I'm definitely thinking about forking over bigger bucks for the upgrade (if only it had an impact/extreme sports rating...).Negatives of the XP20:Though I love (loved) my XP20, when compared with other digital cameras I own/have owned, it did have a bit of a Neanderthal feel to it. Primitive, but in a nice retro way. For example, the zoom was quite noisy and it was quite a finicky camera--I don't know if my technique was poor, but it often took a few shots to get an unblurry photo, though at other times it would perform brilliantly. I can't complain about the quality of the undewater shots/videos, they always amazed me with their beauty and the wonderful sounds recorded as the camera went below the surface in video mode.Overall though, I feel my investment in 2 XP20s was worth it, though it would have been nice to still have my  functioning second XP20, if I had read R. Zamudio's review...I would recommend that you purchase the higher model XP200 if you're planning to abuse the camera like me. I did experience very light leakage that didn't compromise the camera when jumping off of normal backyard swimming pool diving boards and when taking it on bodyboarding rides in light surf, but I may just have been lucky up until now.", "Date": "July 23, 2013"}, {"Title": "Easy to use", "Author": "David A.

Our first XP20 died after its second day underwater (immediately returned to store for full refund). Our second XP20 worked well underwater. So far no water leaks. For added reassurance, I added layer of petroleum jelly/Vaseline to all sides of USB/battery doors. It worked well and I don't have to worry about camera malfunction in the water.- It is hard to see what you taking pictures of underwater on the LCD screen due to glare. We just point and shoot in the direction of interest. I was only able to see the LCD screen underwater on cloudy days.- Picture is definitely better than those underwater one-time-use point-and-shoot disposable cameras2) Other picture modes when compared to other 14MP digital cameras- Poor picture quality indoors (flash is not that bright)- Sub par picture quality when outdoors- It is not a good all purpose digital camera3) LCD screen- Clear display of pictures- Camera computer is very slow compared to other digital cameras- Review of pictures tend to load much slower4) Camera lens- Camera lens is located on the corner- Easy to get smudge due to location- Make sure camera lens is clean or else picture will have smudge/cloudy haze", "Date": "February 17, 2012"}, {"Title": "Good Backup", "Author": "Kurt Thomas \"Adventurous type\"", "ReviewID": "R2CAZDHYOU447X", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "I got this as an upgrade from the Z33 WP, which I had purchased for one snorkel excursion off the SE Florida coast, where it got me a decent shot of a large, but unusually friendly barracuda.

I also used it to introduce my 7 year-old nephew to photography, who proved it to be quite kid-proof. Picture quality in broad daylight has been acceptable. Face recognition and scene recognition software is quite good. Macro-shots of insects and flowers during hikes have been surprisingly good. The only faults I have found with this model are a battery door that takes a little muscle to shut properly and lousy indoor/low light capabilities. Indoor shots with the flash, if you're not within 5 feet-forget it. Indoor shots actually come out better if you can stabilize the camera and take the shot in Natural Picture mode, without flash.
