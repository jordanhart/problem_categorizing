{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Wonderful little camera", "Author": "Ankur Mathur \"Anks329\"", "ReviewID": "R2LRA99KV181QP", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I bought this camera as a birthday present for myself and it has been wonderful. The small compact size of it is the best point. It is small enough to comfortably fit in my jeans pocket along with my cell phone. The screen is bright, and you have a lot of options that you can change without digging through the menu. For example, you can easily change the picture quality, flash mode, ISO speed, and a couple of other things that I can't remember right now.The downside, is the size. With a camera this slim and small, it's occasionally hard to hold it steady enough (depends on the lighting on how long the shutter is open). But I've gotten a couple of blurry pictures  because I hit the trigger too hard and it made it slightly blurry. The anti shake works, but not always.Overall, the camera is great, and I would highly recommend it to anyone.", "Date": "April 21, 2008"}, {"Title": "Great camera!", "Author": "Bill Hellyer \"billhe\"", "ReviewID": "R3QGRUKWW3T9S4", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I bought this camera a few weeks ago and it has been great.  Im still playing with it a lot, checking out all the cool settings.  The camera is small, sleak, and looks great.  It easily fits in a pocket for carrying.  The camera was also a very reasonable price considering the great quality.  The megapixel and resolution is very nice.  So far i really love this camera.  All my friends have been impressed with it as well.  I would definatly buy one again if I had to.", "Date": "April 6, 2008"}, {"Title": "this camera rocks!!", "Author": "Kristophe Seydel \"chocoleche\"", "ReviewID": "R3GWUNJ0UASTRB", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "this is the best camera in the world! it's so small and looks cool too. I just throw it in my pocket and take it everywhere with me. it's easy to use and the photo/video quality is pristine. not to mention how easy it is to upload the images to my mac, I just plug it in and it automatically puts everything into a new folder. it also asks if you want to clear all the uploaded files from the camera so that it's ready for the next run. absolutely love it.", "Date": "May 2, 2008"}, {"Title": "Proprietary USB Cable", "Author": "drbobo", "ReviewID": "RD6UPW8R4HHB1", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Great camera with ONE exception!The USB cable is proprietary.

The camera is light, easy to use, and has all of the features one could want, including a 3x zoom, all for a very reasonable price.

It takes clear, sharp pictures and turns on quickly. I timed it myself and I turned the camera on AND took a picture in under 2 seconds. I would have given it five stars, but after 2 years of use, the camera quit focusing at all, making it pretty much unusable. I did love it while it lasted, though.", "Date": "July 21, 2012"}, {"Title": "Casio Exilim EX -S10SR", "Author": "Jorge Campos", "ReviewID": "RX0VWW7W2Z49W", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I bought this camera back in 2008. So far the camera has met almost every expectation I had and the description of what it does. It is a great little camera that easily fits in my jean pocket without creating a large bulge. It's discreet, easy to carry, and easy to operate. I like the configuration of the buttons and how they're arranged. There are a lot of features to adjust the picture quality and effects.If you say you know how to use a camera, but you're asking yourself or others how to improve the quality by adjusting sharpness, contrast, and saturation then you probably don't know how to adjust the picture quality on a TV either. This camera has a lot of settings to enable the user to get their desired picture quality as close as possible if not better. Look to get at least a 4gb SD card with it if you want the most out of your pictures. I put on a screen protector on the lcd display and got a case to carry it around. It has the most minute(small) scratches on it that i'm not even sure it is a scratch (looking at it right now)...This is a warning though! Be very careful of not bumping the LCD display, it is very fragile and if medium to moderate force is applied to the screen, it will damage it. I used to have an S600 exilim and it had a hairline crack after i accidently bumped it against the side edge of my desk. It wasn't a hard hit since all i did was move the camera,  but caught it at the edge of the desk.", "Date": "December 17, 2011"}, {"Title": "very nice compact camera, the best ever, nice pic & video", "Author": "T.

It's so small and portable and Consumer Reports ranked it very high. Unfortunately, the picture quality is poor. Low light pictures are very grainy and even in bright sunlight, pictures are dull and washed out. I'm not a novice with cameras and I've tried manually adjusting the settings but get the same mediocre results. It's small and has great battery life, so very casual users will probably be fine with the mediocre pictures. But if you want to capture quality photos and stay digital, get a Nikon or Canon DSLR. I use a Nikon D40 and the images are in a different league.", "Date": "November 24, 2008"}, {"Title": "EXCELENT!!!!", "Author": "Luis Zambrano", "ReviewID": "R3CIRN1QU0GHH0", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "The camera is AWESOME...
