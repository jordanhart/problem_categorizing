{"Reviews": [{"Title": "The Sony DSC P-50 is a very good camera!", "Author": "Calvin (SF)", "ReviewID": "R1BTYJKWN8BPLV", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "The P-50 and Canon A20 were my final two choices.  I decided to go with the P-50 because it used only 2AA batteries and had the MPEG and Clip Movie recording features which is very neat.I'm glad I went with the P-50.  Here is my pro and con list for the P-50:Pros:* 3 optical zoom (it zooms fast)* Uses 2 AA batteries.  Don't get the battery pack.  Just get 6 NiMh batteries with a rating of at least 1600mha, which are inexpensive.  I got 4 Energizer 1600 mha NiMh batteries and a recharger at Target for only $...  NiMH batteries last twice as long as alkalines and I haven't had to worry about my batteries dying.* MPEG and Clip (GIF) movie modes are real fun.  No sound on the MPEG, but spending an extra $... for a camera with sound wasn't worth it to me.  For you who design web pages, you'll love the Clip (GIF) movie mode.* Memory Stick, although expensive, is much more compact and stores more memory.  However, the 4MB stick that comes with the camera is lame unless you plan to take only lower quality resolutions.  I got a 64MB stick and at FINE quality (if using STANDARD quality, double all the numbers below) can hold the following: 67 1600x1200, 174 1024 x768, 400 640x480.  As you can see that's alot of pictures.* ISO flexibility and twilight mode.  This helps when shooting in low light.  The AF illuminator really helps the camera to focus in low light.* Can crop pictures and cut MPEGs.* If you change the Power Save mode to \"off\", then the camera lag time (a common complaint in these reviews) after you take a picture is very minimal.  It's actually fast compared to other digital cameras I've used.* Very fast transfer rate using the USB driver.  The camera becomes another drive in Windows Explorer that you just drag to your hard drive.  Very fast.  I have Windows ME which allows Windows Explorer to view in thumbnail mode, so I can even preview all the pictures before moving them to the hard drive.* The video out mode is cool.  Just plug in the supplied jack cord to your P-50 and to your TV or VCR and see a slide show of your pictures you just took.* If you auto-focus by pressing the shutter button half way, then the camera takes the picture very fast with almost no lag time, unlike other digital cameras in this price range,* 37mm threads and the fact the optical zoom stays within the camera allows you to use an UV filter for better picture quality and as a lens protector.* You can view your pictures taken also in thumbnail mode.  Also, the camera tells you your settings (i.e shutter speed, iso, EV, etc.) of the picture.* The camera allows the option to imprint the date onto your digital photos.  This is a must for me as I never remember the date of the picture without this feature.* The lens cap comes with a lens strap so you won't lose your cap.Cons:* 41mm lens.  If you know photography, you will realize that most SLRs and point and shoots have 35mm lens.  The lower the number, the better the wide angle, which allows you to take more area from the same distance making your objects also larger.  However, the above pros by far outweigh this.  If you're not a camera junkie like I am, you probably won't even notice this.* The viewfinder only shows approx 70% of the actual picture taken and is slighty \"skewed\" to the left.  If you think you got your object centered using the viewfinder, you'll will find out that the subject will be slightly left in the actual picture.  The way around this is to use the LCD, which shows 100% of the actual picture and is not skewed.All in all, in the 2.1 megapixel range and under $... as of 9/8/01, I feel this camera is the best one.", "Date": "September 8, 2001"}, {"Title": "Great Camera !, I actually bought 2 more !", "Author": "Rob Cummings Jr. \"berkelusa\"", "ReviewID": "R1N2MIXPWYFW6L", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "The only thing I would like to see on AMAZON is better descriptions on items, this one has no details so ill give them to you all since I now own 3!, Sony 2.1-Megapixel Cyber-Shot Digital Camera Model: DSC-P50 3x optical and 6x digital zooms get you in close to your subject, while a high-speed, auto-focus illuminator lends sharp focus in the dark (this was really neat, sort of a night-vision option), Memory stick storage (comes with a 4-meg), LCD viewer and the older \"peep-hole\" style allowing you to shut the LCD off for longer battery life, on/off optional Flash, USB connections and even an mpeg video mode to let you capture and ceate your own movie shorts (no sound), Very simple to use once you get the buttons down, Only thing I didnt like was no rechargeable battery pack?? or power cord??, (they sell them seperately), a plus+ is that like I said the LCD can be shut off saving your AA batteries from drainage so fast like most camera do!, Smallest resolution 640x480 (real sharp) largest is 1600x1200, also SOLARIZE, B&W, SEPHIA & NEGATIVE ART Image modes when taking pictures// very neat, white balance controls and normal/fine picture modes, sharpness, flash level and ISO controls often ignored on other cameras are ON THIS ONE!, To me as a buyer..

Something that Sony doesn't tell you when you read the specs on this sucker! I bought mine and tried it out right away. It came with a set of batteries that I plugged in and started shooting. As far as taking pictures, it's pretty striaghtforward and easy to use. Here's the catch.When I went to download the pictures onto my laptop, I opened up the manual and guess what it says? \"Do not use battery power to download pictures to computer. You must use the dc power supply\". Hmmm... So I rummage through the box and guess what there's no power supply. You have to buy it seperately!You'd think that for $..., Sony could throw in a stupid power cord! I mean charge me more for it or whatever but I was pretty...[mad] that it didn't come with the camera. Also, it only comes with regular batteries - which is fine but using them to download pictures drains batteries dead.So if you want the power supply and perhaps the battery it's going to cost you another $...

This isn't one of them.My big debate was to buy a camera from a primarily electronics manufacturer or from an established camera manufacturer. After much thought and research I went with the P50. It came down to the P50, Canon A20, or to wait for the Nikon 775 or Olympus 510 (I bought in May `01). Shoulda waited...I'll just summarize, otherwise it'll be a 2 page review:PROS:-High quality images in good light (outdoors)-Nice size-Only 2AA's required. Decent life if you minimize LCD display time and get 1600mAh capacity Ni-MH rechargeables. I get about 20-30 pictures with flash indoors with little or no LCD use. Outdoors maybe 40-50 pictures. (From the review below - If your flash is dead after only picture you're doing something wrong!!)-Flash exposure and ambient exposure compensation modes.-Takes MPEG movies. (no sound though:()-Can use infolithium pack-Painless connection to the PCCONS:-POOR pictures in low light conditions - Lens is slower than the competition (F3.8 vs 2.8 for competition), Flash is pathetically weak. Even in night mode, the camera fails to let in enough light to take pictures of a lit building, even with +2ev overexposure dialed in.-Flash recharge time when using NiMH batteries is slooooooow.-Menu system cumbersome to use if you're fiddling with exposure and flash settings often. Direct access buttons are much faster.-Infolithium battery and charger are big $!-Sony memory sticks more money than the competition. (though they are a nicer form factor and more durable IMHO)In summary, if you do alot of picture taking outdoors, you'll probably be pretty happy, but if you're using the flash and indoors, probably not.

Here are the things I noticed1) You must have the Rechargeable Nimh 1600 amph batteries atleast 4 at hand.(better you order the sony starter or stamina kit, comes with charger, battery and cover)2) Duracell AA(reg) batteries lasted for 4 pictures with flash and about 7 min of playing with the menu.3) I feel the quality of the image is good. I also feel the image is slightly darker on the right or as a whole when you take in the night time probably because the flash isn't powerful enough. To get a better picture in the night you must be within 5ft max.4) The pictures taken at the daytime are amazing the best of the cameras so far.5) Mpeg has no audio but can record upto your memory stick capacity.(previous models have audio but they allow you to record upto 15sec(dsc-s50))6)I agree with one of the prev reviews saying the viewfinder only shows approx 70% of the actual picture takenOverall I would give 8/10 and I would recommend this to others.thanks,Jag", "Date": "October 8, 2001"}, {"Title": "Good Camera", "Author": "Amol Kumar", "ReviewID": "R3RBSYGEXDEQQ2", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "This camera is actually a good camera for the price, the major complaint was that it didn't come w/ a lithium battery. But you can order a \"Value-Pack\" from Sony that includes a battery, charger and a nice case. So that wasn't much of a problem, I also recommend getting a 32 or 64 MB Memory stick, my 64 mb stick can hold about 66 high quality (1600x1200), and about 160 (1024 X 768), and of course about 370 (640X480) Which is a alot of pictures, and about 11 min of video (mpeg)w/o sound. I would strongly recommend buying the \"Info-lithium battery\" from Sony (comes in Value-pack), because it displays how many minutes of battery life you have remaining, which comes in handy. Normal AA batteries could die on you without warning! One other thing that bothered me, was the lag time of the camera after it took a picture, but all \"digital\" cameras that I've seen seem to do this; you take a picture w/ flash and after the picture is recorded the screen goes blank for a couple seconds, but if you take a picture w/o flash, there is no lag time.

Who was the genius that  decided to position a JUMBO sized lens off to the side!?  Hello!  Where am I supposed to position my FINGERS!2)  The battry consumption is insane! I went through my  Energizer Max after only 8 pics!  I guess I should go buy  the more expensive lithium batteries, or better yet some  stocks in battery companies.3)  I much prefer the sliding lens cover that comes on the  olympus D510.  The dangling Sony cover is extremely annoying.4)  The constant need to use the flash.  Without it, you will not  be able to take good pics in less lighted areas.  Oh yeah,  when you do use the flash, have fun waiting for the slooooow  charge as the Sony is DRAINING your batteries.I am a huge Sony fan and I've bought numerous Sony products over the years.  I even have a Sony MasterCard.  But this product is a major disappointment to me.  For the price and the way the electronics world works you're much better off shop around and if you insist on Sony Brand, just wait for a later update (which will inevitably be better and cheaper).

Very few digicams come with complete power setup and accessory pack.  Check the included accessories in product listings.I recommend using NiMH AA rechargeable instead of the expensive infoLithium.  Get about 8 batteries and a charger.  This can be done for half the price of the and charger.Also pick up at least a 32mb Memory Stick.  64mb if you can afford it.  But shop around.

It takes great clear pictures and has a great zoom. It's compact size is just right. It does eat batteries so I would get the info-lithium with charger. I purchased the wide angle lens and a 64mb memory stick. With the 64mb memory stick you get about 120 pictures at 1600x1200 jpeg mode, TIFF mode takes up much more memory. If you plan on printing pictures as big as 11x14 that's great. The lower setting will yield very high quality 5x7's or 4x6's. I find that if you take pictures at a very high setting and then try to shrink them to fit smaller paper they are not as clear (This is with any digital camera) It is very easy to use and it takes MPEG movies. Even editing within the camera is easy. Downloading pictures is real easy too. The software is great and easy to use. As with any SONY product the accesories cost more.

Being the techno freak I am, I wanted a camera that could do anything I wanted it to. I was almost set on an Olympus when this Sony came in at my work. It was love at first site. For a bit more money I was getting a much better zoom, movie recorder and Sony quality. Needless to say, I got it on my Birthday and I could not be happier. Setting it up is incredibly easy *as most of Sony products are* and using it makes even a novice an expert with a few hours of practice. The layout of the camera is comfortable and lightweight, Easily held in one hand to take pictures. The LCD is bright and crisp and show almost no slowdown when viewing it. A very nice turn nob selects the mode on the camera, No more fiddling with menus on the LCD. The 3xoptical zoom is great when you want to get a little closer. An optional 6xdigital is there to, but the pictures turn out to fuzzy. This camera could do anything you want it to, macro shots, low light, fast action, low light, low background light, movies,clip art, clip motion, red eye reduction and more! The menus system is very straightforward, hard to screw up. Picture quality is awesome. Though sometimes a bit soft, easily rectified with the Photosuite 8.1 the camera comes with. It would be hard pressed to get a better program without spending alot of money. Installation of the USB software takes just minutes, and a full 32 meg Stick takes just 30 seconds to upload. *no more serial!*One bad side, this thing eats batteries like Joan Collins goes through makeup. I went through 6AA alkaline in 3 hours the first day. VERY HIGHLY RECOMMEND getting rechargebles, Nickel Metal Hydride perferred, this camera loves its batteries.Oh, and im talking about the 1.3pixel model. I now have the DSC-P50 and wow, the pictures are even better quality! Well worth the extra [money]the P50 costs!Also, recommend getting a bigger Sony Stick, the included 4 meg only does 3 pics at highest setting, a 32meg will get you 34. *what I use*In all, I am very much enjoying this camera and taking great photos....For people who want to get into the Digital realm but want a low price for great quality, the SONY DSC-P30 is absolutely hard to beat!

The camera literally eats batteries, like a ton of customers said before me. I tried to use NiMH rechargeable batteries from RadioShack and after only one flash, the batteries would be dead, very unconvenient. I recommend buying the Lithium-Ion Pack with the AC adapter (if not you can't recharge it), just buy the starter kit it has the Li-Pack, the AC Adapter and a nice case for the camera (can't hold any additional lenses though).2. And I think no one talked about it so far is the button to OK command in the menus. You have a cross-shaped pad, just like a video console controller, that you have to press straight in the middle to OK functions. Other functions are carried by the up, down, left and right hands of the cross. It is sometimes difficult to press straight down on the cross, and if you don't do that, it makes your selection move in the menu, which is a little bit frustrating.

I hate to be forced into one brand but this is something that the competition really doesn't offer to the same extent and is certainly worth noting. (I can see my camera images on my sony clie by simply pluging the card in).-Capacity upto 128Mb is huge (equivalent to 5-9 rolls of film) and highly useful/recommended (this upgrade will more than double the usefulness of the camera)-Although there is a perception its pricey it really isn't. I haven't found a more cost effective media which isn't associated with a much inferior camera (unless you're looking for massive, >500Mb, storage capacity).Battery-All digital cameras perform badly in this respect the good thing with the DSC model is that it can use standard battery sizes. I highly recommend buying 4+ AA rechargeable batteries. It'll mean you can not only take more photos but also take them with flash.minusesPicture quality. Its actually fantastic although you should be aware of limitations-Indoors (in fact anywhere where its not bright) you really need to use the flash. I recommend when you first use the camera to experiment with different orientations of the camera, because the flash is quite far from the lense and this will often causes unattractive shadows on walls.-High zoom and moving subjects. A combination of the digital zoom (only at the high end, x6. At the low end optical zoom does a perfect job) and slow response to changes in focus depth give blurry images.OverallThe deal I got (camera plus discounted 128Mb extra memory card) would have great camera at twice the price.", "Date": "November 26, 2002"}, {"Title": "Another Great Sony Product!", "Author": "David Lombardo", "ReviewID": "R31QTJ7OY630KE", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This camera was a christmas gift.

The LCD also has the option to turn off, saving battery life. Which brings up another thing. This camera can use 2 AA's.

Unfortunately, the batteries that come with it lasted about as long as it took to set it up. Fortunately, I was in Chicago the next week and bought the Sony Starter kit which includes a charger and case. I think this is a must have for this camera. Also purchased a 32K Memory stick and wide angle lens (the cheaper lens).The camera itself is great, easily fits in my right hand, and is ruggedly made. We spent two weeks in Europe this summer during which I (stupidly) dropped it twice and no problems. We took hundreds of pictures and I loved the freedom of taking as many pictures as I wanted, downloading them to a Powerbook and then going out for more. I am still learning to use some of the advanced settings in the camera. One thing I've seen is that it is very important to track the white balance setting. The charger works fairly rapidly and with a plug adapter can be used on European current. The wide angle lens has been a disappointment. I also purchased a PCMIA card reader  for my powerbook which has been a great convenience.I would unhesitatingly recommend this camera.", "Date": "August 10, 2001"}, {"Title": "A Great Digital Camera", "Author": "Smooth Sluggo", "ReviewID": "R54ET030Q7482", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "After much research, I finally selected this camera as my second digital camera.  I'm glad I did.Everything great to be said about this camera has already been said: lots of options, great pictures, reasonable price--overall a great value.  I've always been impressed with Sony products and this camera is not exception.  I use this with Windows XP and there are no problems downloading the images to the computer.Two gripes that have already been mentioned.  First, the picture in the viewfinder cuts off part of the picture that's actually taken (ie--the actual picture covers more than that view).  If you use the LCD display in back, it gives you an accurate picture, but that eats up the battery.  Picture quality is terrific.  The 1600x1200 resolution is more than enough, as is the 2 million pixel resolution.  You really don't need that much power--especially if you're e-mailing pictures or posting them online (in fact, if you're emailing the pictures you probably want to select a lower resolution so they don't take up as much space).  The second gripe concerns the power.  Actually, this isn't really a gripe because this exists on ALL digital camera.  The people that whine about this must not have researched/tested other digital cameras.  They all eat up power.  The oft recommended solution has worked for me: spend [$] on Energizer's rechargeable 4-pack  (with recharger) and you'll never worry about power.  I've left the camera on for almost 2 hours with sporadic use without having to change them.  It only uses 2 batteries at a time, so keep the other pair charged and you'll always have a fresh pair.  In contrast, I used regular batteries in them and they lasted under 15 minutes.

I had the camera for a good few months, and loved it. It took great pictures, and being a new digital camera user, the size and awkwardness of teh camera wasn't too bad for me. I was happy for it. I'm a college student, and at the time, the price tag was a little big for me, considering I had to spend a weeks paycheck on it. A few months after I had the cmaera, the LCD broke. It was either dropped, or I bumped into something while it was in my pocket (an easy thing to do, considering it's like a brick). Well, to make a long story short, no one on this entire planet was going to help me to fix this thing, unless I wanted to pay Sony something like [price]for repairs. (Just to let you know, the estimate, which cost me money to ship the camera to some foreign land just for them to tell me some lie, was [price] dollars for labor, and [price]for parts). Being the dummy I was at the time, I paid the extra [price] or so dollars for the warranty, which was useless. The fact that the entire support staff at both are a chain of lamebrains, just handing me over to someone else who couldn't solve my problem was so aggravating that I will never ever buy a sony product again. Making someone belive that they are secure if a product breaks is one thing, but not backing it up at all is entirely bad business practices. And let me remind you that the [price] that Iu spent on this entire ordeal was not a small amount.

A Nikon 775at a friends place looked a lot more neutral. Macro mode was quite impressive: no loss of contrast here.It's great fun getting close ups of flowers etc...For archiving text: The \"text\" mode saves pictures as black andwhite gif files (so quite compressed). However the camera becomesso slow you might as well forget it. Something like 10 to15 seconds between shots at high res. Besides which the resultwas a lot less readable than the JPEG file.
