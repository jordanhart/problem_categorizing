{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Good camera, expensive memory card", "Author": "Baileybear", "ReviewID": "R1PYM5OA6V9OOX", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "This is one of the few ultracompact cameras with a 5x optical zoom.  It is very small with a large (2.5\") beautiful LCD screen.  It is also packed with useful features.  I researched many ultracompact cameras and this one came out on top.  The only caveat is that it takes an xD picture card (developed for Olympus and Fuji cameras), which is 3 times more expensive than an sD picture card.  Also beware... some of the features of the camera, such as the panorama function, will not work unless you use an Olympus H type xD picture card, which of course, is the most expensive type of xD card.  It is still a great camera, but it would be nice if somewhere in the official description of the camera, Olympus had included this information!  Some great features:'Available Light' mode for taking indoor photos -- useful when the flash washes out the subject, but the scene is too dark without the flash.'Image Stabilization' for low light photos'Sunset' which brings out the reds and yellows'Fireworks' -- a great option that makes fireworks photos look fantastic'Behind Glass' which reduces the glare and reflection of subjects taken through glass'Documents' which increases contrastSome features that are funky:'Expression Edit'- this takes a photo and changes the expression of the subject, but makes them look more like a cartoon character'Smile Recognition'- when you lock on the subject, the camera takes a photo when the subject smiles (I haven't gotten this one to work yet, but can't imagine using it very often either).The menu system is very easy to use and there is an on camera guide to help you take better photos.The BEST thing about this camera is the in-camera panoramic function!  It is SO cool and easy to do.  I love it.If it wasn't for the xD card, I would rate it 5 stars.  Because of the fact that you are forced to buy the Olympus xD card to get all of the functions to work, I rate it 4.5 stars.", "Date": "November 27, 2007"}, {"Title": "The BEST camera for the $", "Author": "S.

Hanna", "ReviewID": "R2LHF45NQU9SV6", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I checked the posted reviews for this camera because it was becoming increasingly apparent that the image quality from my new 820 was poor.  I wanted to see if others were finding the same thing.  Reading the reviews by those customers who are getting poor quality images confirmed my suspicions.  My observations have been identical with those in the reviews.It is possible to take good photographs with this camera, the only problem is that you never know when it is going to happen!  Sometimes they are good and mostly they are bad.  I get a better percentage of good ones outdoors but they aren't all good.  Indoors, forget about it.  The poor quality images are grainy and look like someone drew them with crayons.  A lot of the fine detail is just washed out.The features, menus and large display are great, but the only reason for having a camera is to produce images.  If they are lousy images, who cares about all the great features?  What a disappointment this camera is.I purchased the camera for outdoor activities where the camera could, on rare occasions, get wet.  I wasn't expecting to have to give up on image quality.  If I had it to do over again, I would look at the Canon line of compact cameras because they always seem to take great pictures and the video mode produces .avi files which play on Windows Media Player.  I looked at the Nikons and they all seem to produce .mov video files that require you to install Quicktime on your computer.  If Canon could just make a water resistant, compact camera, I would buy it immediately.", "Date": "January 5, 2008"}, {"Title": "Image quality challenged", "Author": "D.

LCD size (MUCH bigger than the Canon), 3. Zoom (at 5x I was looking forward to better telephoto performance), Lastly, Features (the anti-shake and face tracking seemed like a great idea.Well, I took basics like image quality for granted....big mistake! My first round of shots (using the default-auto settings) were out of focus, grainy (took them indoors with little light so that flash was needed) and basically looked like crap. As an experiment, I took 4 shots with the Olympus and Canon framed exactly the same...both with AUTO settings. The difference was DRAMATIC...Canon looked awesome...every Olympus shot was grainy and poorly focused.I suppose it's possible that I got a bad sample from Olympus; I'm going to try to return it.Buyer beware!", "Date": "December 16, 2007"}, {"Title": "Poor Image Quality", "Author": "Lauren shopper \"Lauren shopper\"", "ReviewID": "R21NJCXSGCHYPS", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I have now purchased two of the Olympus Stylus 820 cameras. The first one kept locking up on me.  I would push the shutter button and it would just freeze. The only way to fix it was to remove/insert the battery and it would unlock.  I took that one back and got another one. No problem with this one locking up but a huge problem with the image quality. I bought this camera to replace my older Olympus Stylus 410. I wanted something newer, smaller, faster, etc.  The camera itself is great as far as size, has a great LCD screen, it's fast and easy to use.  However, the image quality is terrible! Shots taken outside look fine.  Constantly all inside shots are dark and grainy.  To experiment I took some identical shots using my old 410 and the new 820. There is a huge noticeable difference in the photos.  The 820 is not only grainy but the colors are off.  The 410  photos came out crystal clear with colors that are true.

This is a great camera with easy to use menus and well placed buttons.  It was immediately recognized by my mac running tiger and ilife version 6.  It  would receive a higher rating, but this size camera suffers from too many pixels in too small an optical eye.  It's not that it doesn't take good pictures,  but my 4 year old Canon rebel digital SLR takes better pictures, despite being only a 6 mega-pixel camera.  The reason is that it's optical eye is larger, and therefore captures more light and can better use it's existing sensors to greater effect.  The Olympus squeezes more pixels sensors into a smaller package.  It doesn't produce a better picture,  just one with more noise and artifacts.  This is a criticism of all cameras of this type.  The trade off is that the camera is smaller than an SLR and therefore easier to carry and use.

On the plus side, the camera is small, the design is good, USB transfer is fast and I like the auto-sensing of the usb connection to the computer, avoiding the needless screen illumination and corresponding battery use during transfer. The battery has been dependable over many cycles and thousands of images. The camera did survive a drop to concrete recently with just small dings.On the negative side, the number one annoyance is slowness to focus out of direct sunlight, frequently allowing out of focus image capture. Focusing by depressing the shutter part way can take time and is not always opportune before depressing fully for capture. The xD memory was not a good storage choice, as it's being phased out now. The printing on the mode dial (camera, playback, etc.) is worn off making correct selection a process of watching what the display does. The lens shutter got gummed up several times, likely due to pocket lint, it always cleared after a while. The power button is too easily pressed, resulting in periodic and inappropriate in clothing or bag lens deployment. The zoom function during video recording is very audible on playback. The image quality in low light situations can be quite grainy and there is no auto-focus during video recording so panning during a shot between foreground and background objects fails to refocus.", "Date": "January 4, 2012"}, {"Title": "Great quality, lousy battery door and battery life", "Author": "R.
