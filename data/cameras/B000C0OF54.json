Downfall is that through your viewfinder it cuts off about 20% of the frame of what your photographing on all sides.  This is minor for taking pictures of people but for landscape would be a downfall.  Say you'd want a certain tree as the left borderline of the photo.  Because of the eyepieces zoom that tree would be at the left part of the viewfinder but when you review the picture it would be more to the right of the edge.  If you get this I recomend carrying both eyepieces around with you because they are easy to switch out.", "Date": "April 4, 2007"}, {"Title": "Good when you don't wear eye glasses", "Author": "K.

When I was wearing eye glasses, I need to press my eye close to see everything but when I am wearing contact, its fine.

It doesn't make the viewfinder seeing less 20% which doesn't make sense unless you wear big thick eye glasses.

The D70 uses mirrors instead of a prism and I've read people saying it is like looking down a dark hallway at your image. I agreed with them until I added this magnifying eyepiece. It eliminates all of the black space around the image! The only down side is that you have to shift your view slightly to see the readouts in the viewfinder. I actually find this to be an advantage so that I compose my shots without distraction. I don't understand why Nikon doesn't ship this on the camera.

It slides right on where the factory eyepiece slides off, like it should; no modifications, no problems. It does not interfere with the flip-out monitor or the diopter dial (or anything else). Though the magnification was not dramatic, it was significant enough to make it well worth the few dollars I spent on it. It also stands out about 1/4 inch further than the factory eyepiece, which gets my face off the monitor a little better. And in contrast to other reviews I have read online, it does not take away from the area of view in the veiwfinder; at least not for me, on my D5100. But I do have to put my eye right up to it to see the whole area, so if you have to wear glasses to see through your viewfinder, this is probably not for you. But I can see the full rectangle, a little bit larger, and a little bit easier; it definately makes manual focussing on distant subjects easier for me.

It fits the Rebel XT pretty snugly. The magnification is perceptible but not earth shattering. The viewfinder image didn't suffer a noticable loss of light. With Rebel X*'s small viewfinder, every bit of magnification might be worth it. But it won't be enough for a precise manual focus.Without glasses on, you can exactly see both the frame and the info bar below it. With glasses on, you can just about see the entire frame, but if you peer to see the info bar, you lose some portion of the top of the frame (image center is still there).This also brings the eye piece a bit forward, so your nose isn't entire squished against the LCD.Nikon users may fume at a review of a part meant for Nikon cameras used on a Canon body, but I felt the review could be useful for Canon users considering this part.

So, I thought I'd try a little magnification on my current viewfinder to help with manual focusing.  I don't wear glasses, and I did not have any problem seeing the full image or the status display at the bottom of the screen.  The image was a little larger (though 1.17x is really not much), and the center of the screen looked fine.  However, I found that the image towards the edge of the screen looked a little blurry, and overall I preferred the view without the magnifier.

Of course it is not the same though. :) ). Simply I like it. However, the user should bear in mind that the range that is seen in the view finder is bigger than the one actually shows up on the picture. So you get smaller result than you saw in the view finder. This gives me some struggle on framing. Another point that I wanted to be improved was that this eyepiece only has a thin small square shaped rubber, and this rubber is not replaceable.

While the view is a bit tight, ie the eye must placed very close to the eyepiece, you still can see the entire image through the viewfinder. As noted in other reviews the increase in image size is not huge but it is enough to make the purchase worth the price.  Definitely not acceptable if the photographer wants to wear glasses but although I wear glasses I never wear them when using my cameras - I've just adjusted the diopter to suit.
