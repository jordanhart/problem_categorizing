I've owned several Canon PowerShot cameras over the past five years and all are still going strong, providing great results. That being said, I decided to look for a digital camera I could easily carry in my purse or backpack that was great at point-and-shoot shots, the occastional bit of video and all for under $100. Of course I looked at the Canon PowerShot line and found the Canon Powershot A590 IS \"REFURBISHED\" Digital Camera, 8.0 Megapixels, 4x Optical Zoom, 4x Digital Zoom, 2.5\" LCD Display and decided to give it a try.For some a refurbished unit is akin to buying used underwear, but for me, I see it as a bonus. First, you're saving money and second, it's been looked over at least twice, which is more than you can say for many brand new products!The A590 is very lightweight and easy to handle, but I have small hands and some may find it's a bit toy-like in its feel. The plastic housing seems sturdy, but time will tell if it holds up. While not as slim as some other digital cameras in its class, it's still small enough to be easily portable.What I like about the A590 is the consistent quality of the photos I've taken. The LCD is great for sizing up the shot, but it also has an eyepiece, which I personally like as I've had other brands of digital cameras (Fuji) in which the LCD has gone bad and without an eyepiece...you're dead in the water. The face finder feature seems to virtually eliminate blured images, even on the auto setting.Ah yes, and the settings are great! Ones for fireworks, aquariums, snow... lots to choose from so read the book and get used to them before heading out. The placement of the 'no flash' button is very conveniently under the right thumb (as you're holding the camera) which in earlier models I've owned has been in an obscure spot on the left side of the camera. \"It's the simple things that make me happiest!\"The 4x optical zoom is nothing to write home about, but the combo of the optical and digital get the job done for most of my photo-taking. The lag between shots isn't bad if you have a Transcend 8 GB SDHC Class 6 Flash Memory Card TS8GSDHC6 or similar memory card installed with fresh AA batteries. Another feature I like is the AA batteries, as if you're traveling, they are easy to find or you can carry your recharger with you for ones like these: Energizer NH15BP-4 ACCU 2450mAh Rechargeable AA Batteries (Four-pack).I decided to buy this camera based on reviews from Cnet and my fellow reviewers on Amazon. They didn't lead me astray...it's a great camera for everyday use by families, travelers, students or anyone who likes to capture adventures and beauty wherever they go.", "Date": "December 28, 2008"}, {"Title": "Right Buy", "Author": "Compchump \"Compchump\"", "ReviewID": "R1MEUIH0TRZXQD", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I was mulling over buying a digital camera for weeks. One internet review site after another I labored and labored. I ran across a review for this jewel and fell in love!

My daughter has used the camera consistently for the last few weeks, and found it very easy to operate.  This is a great camera for the money.

Here are the pros and cons:Pros:Good size- fits in hand and pocket.Very good resolution- if you're taking a still, well-lit shot, your can blow the pictures up very large and still have a decent resolution.Good video and sound:  you can video in fairly low light and sound is ok.Cons:They give you a tiny chip- you have to buy one large enough to hold 200 pictures.  This cost me $20, but could be less now.This camera sucks the life out of regular alkaline AA batteries- apparently you have to buy NiMH rechargeable batteries to give the amperage needed for the power hungry electronics.  This costs an extra $25-50, then you need a set of Li Ion batteries that have longer shelf life for emergencies, because the NiMH lose their charge in a couple of months.  I'm in the process of buying the NiMH batteries.  Flash also sucks the life out of the batteries.Too long a delay for focus and low light situations.  If you're taking sports shots in low light- you'll miss the shots.", "Date": "February 3, 2010"}, {"Title": "Very nice camera with viewfinder,  too bad it is discontinued.", "Author": "Sandra Thompson \"sandrat\"", "ReviewID": "R3EX91J8Y4DY16", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This is the ideal camera for me.  It is easy to use, and I can carry it in my pocket.  The camera has a viewfinder, which is vital for outdoor photography in full sunlight (glare is bad on a screen) and also is vital for older photographers who would have to fish around for reading glasses to compose shots using the viewscreen. If you keep the viewscreed dark, and shoot mostly in sunlight, two AA batteries can carry you through over a thousand shots. Resolution and video are good. It's not an SLR, but for around $100 it is a great multi-situation point and shoot.  WISH THEY WERE STILL MAKING IT!", "Date": "May 6, 2012"}, {"Title": "Digital camera", "Author": "C.

But, in short, it eats batteries. This, in my estimation, is an overwhelming issue. I have tried common AAs, which it goes thru within several pictures. I have tried re-chargeable, which you need to carry a half dozen or so to get you thru the afternoon. And I have tried very high-dollar lithiums, which do a little better, but not enough to get you thru a half-days worth of shooting. I have tried ignoring the low battery indicator thinking that it was inaccurate. It wasn't.IF you could somehow keep it running, it would be a fairly good camera, though not as good as the Canon Elph which it replaced.Others have noticed the same thing as I, maybe they have \"fixed\" the problem by now.", "Date": "June 23, 2010"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": null, "Features": null, "Name": null, "ImgURL": null, "ProductID": "B001DDKEWM"}}
