I wasn't anticipating good results but I want the high FPS rating.Well I am very impressed.  My previous card only had 30FPS total for 4 cameras.  This card has 30 FPS for EACH camera.  It installed prefectly.  No Problems at all.  The video is great.  No jumping.  Color is good and night vision is good. It is very well worth the money.I highly recommend this card.", "Date": "June 2, 2010"}, {"Title": "Hardware Good, Software Horrible", "Author": "R.

I got a quick response when e-mailed, It was infuriating it was like talking to a robot with bad English! I could get the remote monitoring working in IE8 in Windows 7 with problems, but works better in XP running IE8. I have an HTC Touch PRO (with a stock rom) the windows mobile software is incompatible I'm assuming because of the VGA screen, It might run on a QVGA screen I dont't know for sure (I Wouldn't be surprised if it didn't). The remote monitoring software works fine on an iphone. There is an unsupported (independent) app available for the android, but it crashes the SERVER every time you run the program. Bottom line this product works good for the money. But don't plan on doing any cell phone monitoring unless you have an iphone. Don't buy this unless you have set up a DVR before, and know your computers. Don't plan on contacting customer support. Well you can contact them but don't plan on it doing you any good. The product says the remote viewing software works with Windows Mobile Pro 6.1, which is the OS my phone runs.  I'll include a copy of my mind numbing conversation with Q-SEE.(ME) - I bought this card to be able to monitor my dvr from my cell phone. The software than installs on my phone does not run properly. It does not display correctly. I have an HTC Touch Pro. I'm sure there are other people having this problem as well. Thank you(Q-SEE) - Is your phone running windows mobile pro 6.5? If so you are correct there probably many others having the same problem. The card will work with mobile pro 6.1 but the factory is still working on revisions that will allow the card to work with the changes that microsoft made in 6.5. They have not given us a time frame yet for these revisions.(ME) - No i am running 6.1 I think its because I have a vga screen and the software is native to a qvga(Q-SEE) - Yes you are correct, you need to change the screen resolution. So is it working now ?(ME) - Any suggestions on how to change the screen resolution on a Windows Mobile Smartphone Running windows mobile 6.1?(Q-SEE) - need to know exact make and model of your Phone.To my knowledge, there are no settings to change vga on the phones. On my HTC Mogul running 6.1 there are no settings.(ME) - Sprint's HTC Touch Pro Win Mo Pro 6.1... It's been over seven business day's and I've had no response... The software version was 6.3.1.1.Good Luck", "Date": "March 1, 2010"}, {"Title": "Good Product", "Author": "Telcom", "ReviewID": "RRN88S4S7CEIB", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "This product works great as my second security system through my PC.

It requires a PC with some horsepower. Two of my older PC's could not run it. The only PC that came close was my HP Pavilion 762, found out my video card was failing. Had to buy a replacement, Radeon 9000 AGP with 256mb memory.Once the hardware was stable, then the software was installed. It does run, but is not easy to work with. You have to dig thru the screens to find the correct adjustments. The screens do not allow for moving them, where they land is where the stay, top left corner. When a camera triggers a motion record, the map with the camera symbol over lays the image, so you cannot see the image during the record. The map is on top flashing yellow. Loading your own map is also painful, you have to be in the edit screen which is buried within the alarm screen, which is the fifth screen within the config screen. Also, found the system resolution is capable of 640 X 480 but the motion record only works at the lower resolution of 320 X 240. I am still trying to get the internet feed working, so I can review remotely, appears to be my router.

It replaced an older external Falcon DVR that had a fan that sounded like a hurricane.  A PCI card would be perfect, I thought, since my HTPC is already whisper quiet.The card installed in one of my PCI slots without a hitch.  Upon rebooting, Windows couldn't find the driver as anticipated.Having read that this card didn't come with Windows 7 drivers, and wanting to start out with the latest drivers and software anyway, I downloaded the SuperDVR software from the q-see web site.  I launched setup and it started installing drivers and after a few seconds gave me an error dialog saying \"No video card.\"The manual says if you get an the error message \"Can't find card\" to try rebooting.  Well, that's not exactly the message I got, but I tried rebooting anyway.  No difference.Oh well, I thought, guess I'll try the CD.  The CD installed, although with multiple error messages.  First, Windows says it can't verify the driver publisher and you have to tell it to install anyway.  But then, even if you do, Windows says it did not install properly.Nonetheless, it did launch after all that.  That's when I ran into the next problem.  It says \"Please change resolution to 1024x768 or 1280x1024\" and exits.  Well, I'm connected to a 60\" television at 720p, so my resolution is 1280x720.  No way for me to get the software to run with that resolution, though.  Fortunately, after switching to 1920x1080 interlaced, the software did launch, despite the earlier error message.After launching, it gives you a warning that you haven't set your drive location for recording.  I go to do that and my only choice is C: - I only have one drive with one partition on my HTPC.  No problem, I say, I'll just map my network drive and use that.  Well, first you have to pick C: because it won't let you exit without specifying a drive.  Then, you get a big warning from SuperDVR advising against recording to your boot partition.That warning is good advice, because the way the recording software works is that it runs until it fills your hard drive.  When it does, you can either have it stop recording, or start overwriting - obviously neither of those would be a good thing for your boot partition.  I did not find any method of limiting the amount of space SuperDVR will consume on a drive.I set the recording drive to C:, exited, mapped a drive to my Synology NAS, and relaunched.  No luck.  SuperDVR doesn't seem to recognize network drives.So, I ordered an external USB drive from Amazon.  When that gets here, I'll try again.  Based on my experience so far, I have very low expectations.Note:  After I got it \"working\" that far, I tried again to install the downloaded software.  It doesn't perform an upgrade, though - it forced me to uninstall the CD version first.  Then, after running setup with the software from the web site, again \"No video card.\"", "Date": "September 15, 2010"}, {"Title": "running Q-see for about 7 years", "Author": "Scott Kessler \"Sussco\"", "ReviewID": "RVDMBH0YDHNEY", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Well it is late so this will be short and sweet.I have owned the older 30 fps card and now own the new card at 120 fps and i am very pleased with it i have four QSOCWC Weatherproof CMOS Cameras w/Night Vision. this is a very good low cost solution to home or small business security.Scott", "Date": "August 25, 2010"}, {"Title": "Compatibly", "Author": "Rwmartin \"fltwoway\"", "ReviewID": "R23HCPHES4LN99", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "Q-See, like many manufactures today, are unwilling to correct issues that arise from the use of their older products. I bring this to everyone's attention so one may avoid another one of life's little inconveniences.  Their site claims that a person can expand a QSPDVR04 to an eight-channel system by adding another QSPDVR04, a card of the identical model. After locating such a card at a slightly higher dollar amount than the original card, due to it's out of production status, I find that the upgrade is not possible, nada, no way, will not happen. What they should add to their compatibility information on their web site is the ROM version on the same model card must also be compatible.

THE SOFTWARE is poor. in fact it's poorer than poor. it's cumbersome to use. it's intrusive in a way that you have to have it open for it to record. ideally, programs like this should be able to automatically startup with the windows \"minimized\" to the system tray; that way it is constantly functioning in the background doing its job without needing the program to be opened right in-your-face. there's no way for you to reposition the program window too. i can't remember the last time i wasn't able to drag the program window to reposition at a different place, maybe back with windows 3.1?. But my #1 biggest issue with the software which i absolutely can't take is that it disables Aero in windows 7. there's just no way to tell it to NOT disable Aero. those of you with VISTA or Win7 will understand how annoying that can be. so in order for you to record your surveillance footage, and/or just to watch the Cams in live, you have to live without Aero.i am seriously thinking about returning this purchase for another competing product that might not have as good of a hardware capability, but at least the operating software will be up to the standard. i might consider to keep it if there's a way to bring back Aero.", "Date": "August 18, 2011"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": null, "Features": null, "Name": null, "ImgURL": null, "ProductID": "B002RL8IF4"}}
