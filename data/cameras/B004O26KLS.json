And when i receive it, in Sam`s club I found this item, with a IS 55-250 mm lens, a bag and memory in 649 usd. I was very disappointed, because  these bundle (Sam`s) was a bargain and i was thinking that amazon and cameta was a better price that others (generally Internet sellers are cheaper, i thaught). Was my fault, and now i have to buy a lens in usd 200 ,more or less. I will wait Sam^s, next time.", "Date": "July 9, 2011"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": null, "Features": null, "Name": null, "ImgURL": null, "ProductID": "B004O26KLS"}}
