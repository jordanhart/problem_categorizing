Use High capacity (1100mah or higher) nicads or Nimh.  Carry extra sets. But...pictures are excellent.  It has three distance settings close up, portrait, and distance.  The macro close  up is wonderful.  As close a six inches!  And the exposure is perfect. You  have to get used to distances, especially with flash, when changing the  distance feature.I would swear this is an Agfa.  Looks EXACTLY like it.  Same price.  For the price, it is a great deal.You can \"frame\"  your picture with the viewfinder, or the LCD display in back.  You can  display pictures on the TV (video in, not RF in), and load into a computer  using any RS232 COMM port. The Camera's software is ok.  The  \"TWAIN\" driver (connection between camera and photo software)  attaches to all photo software in the computer, not just the Photomax  program that comes with it. Just select the source in your program.It  resembles a 35mm \"Point and Shoot\" camera in many respects.  It  has a nice cover that slips over the lens and turns the camera on and off.  If you can use a P&S, you can use this.Resolution using the  12exposure mode (high resolution, just 12 pictures) is just about as good  as 100ISO or 200ISO camera print film. Looks tolerable on a 32\"  TV!I have many GOOD 35mm SLR's, and am happy with this little jewel.  No  more stacks of negatives stored away.  Just a few recordable CD's, and I  can put the images on a floppy to give to family, or email the pictures.

Wifey and I had been kicking around the idea of getting a digital camera for a while, but  the pile of \"toys we don't play with anymore\" was too large to  warrant buying something expensive on a lark.  We shopped around and found  the Polaroid didn't have all the bells and whistles that we'd read about in  all the gizmo magazines, but it didn't carry that price either.  I don't  think that two days has gone by without us using it in some way. If you run  on line auctions or post pictures to a web site this little guy will do  everything you need.  Need something to e-mail pictures to grandma?  You  can even hook it up to a TV with the included cables and run a slideshow  for the family.  The software it comes with is fairly easy to use and setup  was a breeze.  The serial connection is quite a bit slower than USB, but  for the price there are really no complaints.

I am very pleased with both the quality of this camera and the ease of use- especially for the price.  The few negative reviews I read posted  here have me a little confused, though- there are various selections for  the settings on this camera, which could explain some problems.  I have  lots of really nice shots using this camera.  None would work to enlarge to  poster size, though- so don't buy it for making really big prints.  I like  the way my 5x7 prints and smaller turn out for my scrapbooking and crafts  needs.Of course, another consideration would be the printers the  negative reviewers used in printing their images, ... they don't mention  the paper type, either- all very important in the quality of the end  product.As for the \"grainy\" images- the flash is a little less  than perfect for indoor shots sometimes- but not always.  Lighting is  important in any photography, and my favorite shots were nearly all taken  outdoors, with natural light.  You definitely cannot rush the recharge on  the flash- you'll get dark images every time.  Also- the \"video\"  function on the LCD monitor is a huge battery drain.  Skip using it.  I  bought an optional FlashPath adapter that allows me to use the SmartMedia  memory card in my floppy drive- excellent way to go- instead of using  cables and power suppplies directly to the camera.I really don't see it  as a battery hog, unless you use the \"video\" option- which isn't  needed to take pictures at all.I will look for a date stamp in my next  digital camera, as well as an on/off switch NOT connected to a sliding lens  cover.

I think it takes decent pictures and is an excellent camera for beginners.  I have some advice for anyone looking at getting  this camera, #1, buy rechargeable batteries and a charger. I spent about  $20 on a charger that came with 4 batteries and an additional pack of 4  batteries, and I haven't had any trouble since. #2, if possible, buy a  larger memory card. The 2 meg will get you fine, but the 8 would be really  nice for me right now! #3, get the adapter for the memory. This way you  won't have to fiddle with the cables and ac adaptor, my serial cable went  out already and had to be replaced.. Heavy use! The reason I give this a  4 and not a 5 star rating is because of the resolution. While it does take  nice pictures, the print output is really only the best on the highest  resolution, and the prints are small (4x6). I would say this camera is best  for taking small pictures or for web/email use.

No it's not as good as the $900 super-loaded 1.2 mega pixel giants but it is a very nice purchase.  Yes, the little colored monitor follows the action with a huge blurry delay but most cameras this cheap don't even come with one so, you get what you pay for I say.  That in mind, you aren't recording video here  so why would the display need to follow the movement like a camcorder as  long as, when you stop moving, it focuses clearly?  I'm no photographer so  I say this from a novice point of view, the camera does not take pictures  well in low light situations.  Its best performance comes from good ambient  lighting such as outside or in a brightly lit room.  I'd also like to see  it come with more then 2 megs of memory but that would up the price so I  wont complain too much.  Those little static RAM cards are way too  expensive.  All-in-all the camera did as advertised and did it well enough  for my taste but keep in mind I'm no photographer.  I really hate, though,  the stupidly place green LED in the viewfinder!  It all but forces you to  waste battery life and use the LCD to find the right picture angle.  I  think they could have found a better place for that dumb little light that  seems to have no purpose other then to be an annoyance.I say the camera  was good but the included software was a nightmare to get working.  It took  me 2 days of tinkering before I got the camera to upload images to the PC.  I'm still not sure if my software disk wasn't messed up, like it could have  just had a bad installer.  I finally tried a custom install to make sure  everything was getting installed properly and that worked.  But before that  I contacted the tech support at Polaroid and they were absolutely no help,  telling me to try things I had already tried and I even stated that I tried  them in my original e-mail.  I still don't think they even read my whole  message.  They just saw \"my camera wont upload images right\" and assumed  idiot.  When I finally did get the software working it did everything it  was suppose to.  Though I haven't tried everything it offers yet.  When the  pictures came through to the PC they looked nice and crisp.So, all  things considered, you might want to shop around for a better low price  camera but this one is fine once you get everything to sync right.  If  you're not a pro I'd say keep this one in mind because it does just as  advertised quite well and thus far Polaroid is the only company offering  low priced digital cameras with LCD color monitors, which I like a lot.", "Date": "March 2, 2000"}, {"Title": "Great Digital Camera", "Author": "Drew Smith", "ReviewID": "R2B0NEFEBXAFQM", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I think this is a great digital camera.

Given its current MSRP, I would not have purchased it due to the limited resolution (640 x 480 pixels).  The market is full of digital cameras with better resolution (1-1.5 megapixels) for about the same price.  As ease of use goes, it doesn't get much better than this.  You simply put in the batteries, install the SmartMedia card, turn it on, and start clicking away.  In order to download the pictures you've taken the software must be installed to your computer.  In response to the one reviewer who complained about the software not being compatible with certain editions of Windows, you need merely to go to Polaroids's website and download the patch for Windows 2000 or in my case, Windows XP.  It took only a few minutes to download and I was soon up and running.  This camera is fairly intuitive if you have at least a working knowledge of digital cameras.  I found myself only having to review the user's manual once, and it is fairly straightforward. The green flash indicator in the viewfinder makes it difficult to frame your shot as one previous reviewer noted, and aside from the limited resolution this is about the only other negative thing I can say about the camera.  Although it interfaces with the computer via serial cable as opposed to the much faster USB, I haven't found this to be a major problem.  I downloaded 14 pictures to my PC in only about 2-3 minutes just the night before writing this review.  Picture quality is fair in the high resolution mode, good in super high resolution mode.  I don't recommend using either the medium or low resolution settings.Lastly, regarding battery life complaints I haven't found the PDC 640 to be any worse than any other digital camera.  The kit includes an AC adapter which I highly recommend be used for downloads, which accounts for considerably more battery drain than actual picture taking.  The resolution mode you use will also make a difference (higher resolution = more battery use).If you're looking for an easy to use digital camera the PDC 640 is a very good choice.

Yes, the batteries drain a little fast if you use the LCD screen too much.  The resolution isn't professional quality, but it works for the average user.

I guess the flash is a little weak.  Also, we've had a problem with the LCD screen - it stopped working after only a couple months.  We had fresh batteries and all, the screen just quit on us.  My mother in law had the same problem, but Polaroid replaced the camera for her (she just had to pay for shipping it).  We're working on that right now.

The bad stuff:  The green LED indicator  light gets in the way of aiming your shots, forcing you to use the blurry,  battery-draining LCD screen which is among the worst I have EVER seen on a  digital camera.  The battery power is terrible at best; rechargeables are  the only way to go.  Being a digital camera salesman, I can say without  doubt...this camera is not worth its price tag.  While other reviews may  state that the camera is easy to use, it is merely due to the fact that the  camera has almost no features: no manual control of shots, no zoom, and is  only able to support up to a 8mb memory card(45 pictures max.)  The picture  quality will suffice for monitor viewing only.  Printing out the pictures  leaves something to be desired; using photo quality paper on my brand new  Lexmark printer gave me mixed results.  While printing out smaller image  sizes(3x5) resulted in fair quality pictures, attempting to print larger  size images produced very grainy pictures.  Also, the flash on the camera  is not powerful enough for many low-light situations.  There are much  better cameras on the market in the $200-300 price range.

If that, and simple needs, are all you want, great. Do yourself a favor, though, and pick up a USB media card reader. The software and serial cable are not supported under WinXP, or on a Mac - but the images are stored on the card as .jpg files, readable anywhere. The USB reader will be *many* times faster than the serial cable, as well, and no special software is needed.If you print the pictures (full page) you'll notice some problems - but if you're to the point of printing pictures, you'll want a higher resoution camera anyway. It also takes a LONG time to charge, and several seconds between shots to recharge. Battery life really depends on what batteries you buy - cheap ones, it'll eat like a kid with candy. Buy decent batteries (or rechargables) and they'll last a long, long time. When the batteries are ready to go, though (1/4 left in the indicator) the pictures get awfully dark - you can see them get darker and darker.

However it's over a year later and the price has hardly dropped!  The digital camera world is moving at a very fast pace, I'm sure there's something more up to date in this price range.  Also the reason I was visiting this board in the first place is that I damaged the software CD and cannot install the software for the camera in my new computer.  Polaroid does NOT offer the software drivers for download!  Unacceptable for a product of this type.  They want 39.99 for their software package, all of which is useless(I use PS or Thumbs + for image manipulation) except for the twain driver.  Any other digital cam offers the drivers for download on their site. A few more notes.  1.  Another use you may have overlooked for the camera is as a webcam.  Using a video capture card and the \"TV\" cable for the camera and video mode on the camera you can use this camera (or any camera with a video out) as a webcam. The image more than suitable for internet broadcasting.  It will get hot, but I have run my camera for weeks on end as an \"always on\" cam and have suffered no related problems.2.
