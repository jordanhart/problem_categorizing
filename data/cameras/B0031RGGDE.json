The design is also cumbersome as the smart feature is automatic and to turn it off requires several steps. The camera does not save the settings you input which means that after it goes into sleep mode you'll have to change it again.", "Date": "July 2, 2010"}, {"Title": "M550: Has Its Advantages", "Author": "Sean P.", "ReviewID": "R60PFEXYCR6K6", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I got this camera a couple months ago, and it has been good to me. I'm only 12 years old, and bought the camera expecting to start taking photographs on hiking trips with my dad. We went to Sylamore Creek to take some photographs, and I began thinking, \"Hey, this could be a great job for when I grow up!\" Now to the point of the review: Is it good or not? Well, it has its ups and downs.Pros1. It can take great macro shots2. It has a Long Time Exposure, which is kind of unusual for any point and shoot I've had3. The long time exposure is AMAZING.4. Easy to use, even in manual mode5. Works great in sunlight6. Auto white balance is relatively goodCons1. Low light settings are HORRIBLE.(Long time exposure makes up for that)2. very little zoom3. Not very good Macro Focus modeTo me, this camera is pretty good, but not \"The Best\".", "Date": "September 4, 2011"}, {"Title": "Bought 2 of them, both faulty.  DO NOT buy one of these!", "Author": "P. Shinn", "ReviewID": "RL7SC3SJE0R6B", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "Bought two of the Kodak EasyShare M550 cameras.  One from Best Buy, one from Amazon.com, I need a digital camera for work.The M550 camera bought from Best Buy, from day 1 would go \"purple screen\" after being on for more than a minute.  When trying to take video, photos, you name it.  Screen would start going all purple, then within seconds, completely purple.  The pictures and videos it took were all purple too.  Best Buy said have to use instructions on Kodak's website to send in for service.  Sent it in.  Waiting for repair.Meanwhile, bought an M550 online from Amazon so I would at least have a camera for now until the other one comes back from repair (hopefully working).  This Amazon purchased M550 worked for less than a day.  When I try and zoom in or out, the camera totally locks up and shuts off.  It will not turn back on for hours.  Also, the battery doesn't stay locked in.Why???  Come on, Kodak!  I'm in the broadcasting field.  I know how to treat cameras nicely.  Now, you expect me to send this one in too?  Can't I please have a camera that works?  Both were defective from the day they were purchased.  This is serious quality control problems.  Please, buy something else, do not buy a Kodak M550!No more Kodak cameras.  That's the last straw.  This has gone beyond ridiculous.", "Date": "August 7, 2011"}, {"Title": "M550 camera", "Author": "James F.

I had the camera for about a month when it jammed and the battery started coming loose at random times causing the unit to power down.  I've had to jimmy it secure with a knife and SUPER GLUE the latch in place to have it stay put any longer than a week at a time.  I still own and use the camera with no incident but having to take those steps to rig it up to work left a sour taste on the design quality", "Date": "March 31, 2012"}, {"Title": "Happy Camper", "Author": "LAURA", "ReviewID": "R3C6B4I76WU583", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Very easy to use and takes good pictures.

The pictures are rather grainy.2. There is no way to get a date stamp to automatically print on each picture.  You have to manually add it to every picture.  With two young boys, I take a lot of pictures and always used the date stamp with my old camera so that I could easily keep track of when the pictures were taken.  I wish I had known this before buying.  I never would have chosen this camera.3. When I talked with Kodak's online help service regarding the date stamp, I then could not get the camera to turn on at all.  The representative suggested I take out the battery and memory card and reinsert the battery.  This did solve the problem (for now), but I'm wondering if this will happen more in the future.  The representative claimed it wasn't a common problem, but he certainly seemed to know how to solve it right away...we'll see what happens.4. There is too much delay between pushing the shutter and the picture actually taking.  It makes it extremely hard to capture active kid shots.The main reason I gave it 2 stars rather than one is because it is nice and compact.", "Date": "February 3, 2011"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": "Unavailable", "Features": "12-megapixel resolution for stunning prints up to 30 x 40 inches\n5x optical zoom; 28 mm wide-angle lens\n2.7-inch LCD with KODAK Color Science Technology\nKodak's Smart Capture feature\nCapture images to SD/SDHC memory cards (not included)", "Name": "Kodak Easyshare M550 12 MP Digital Camera with 5x Wide Angle Optical Zoom and 2.7-Inch LCD (Dark Grey)", "ImgURL": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/4195-HyeKkL._SY300_.jpg", "ProductID": "B0031RGGDE"}}
