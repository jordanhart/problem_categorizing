{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Incredible Quality, Several Small Problems", "Author": "PopArt Joe", "ReviewID": "R15WZ2OZ41QSXF", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Wow. I got my s230 about five weeks ago, and have taken over 1500 photos already. I am thrilled with the quality of the camera. It is heavy, built with a very sturdy case, the buttons are quality, the menus (software) are incredibly concise and easy to use/understand. Of course, what most people are concerned with is the picture quality--for this type of camera, it is outstanding. Very few of my photos have turned out \"flat\" and looking like cheap digital pics. Most of them are vibrant and full of depth and detail.Here are the only problems I've encountered so far:1) The worst problem is the delay from the time you push the button to the time the photo takes. It is NEVER immediate, and often takes half a second or more. This is fine for a posed shot, but good luck taking action shots or candid moments. You have to learn the art of predicting where people and objects will be in a half second. Do not buy this camera if you intend to take photos of people in action, i.e. playing sports. You will miss every key photo. I have not found any way around this--playing with the settings does not change the delay.2) Dust collects in the viewfinder lens (on the outside). Not a major problem, but it's very difficult to clean.3) The 2x optical zoom is indeed small. You will have moments where it frustrates you.4) The flash is weak and does create bad red eye.5) The custom USB connection point seems very delicate. I am concerned that in the future this will wear out (however, that is just a guess--no problems have occurred yet).6) The tripod mount is in an awkward position (on the left, but the trigger button is on the right, so the camera tends to wiggle while shooting on a tripod).As for the battery life, I have no problems. I've taken dozens of photos and movies (using the flash and the lcd screen) and it has lasted fine. No complaints there. The memory card is very small for taking hi-res pics, so you will have to get a bigger one.This thing has changed my life. I slip it in my pocket everywhere I go, and it has not let me down. I would highly recommend getting one. Incredible quality + very few complaints.", "Date": "April 24, 2003"}, {"Title": "Canon PowerShot S230: Pocket Hercules", "Author": "A Customer", "ReviewID": "R3GBFVW70DNXCH", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "WHY I PURCHASED THE POWERSHOT 230:I was never really a fan of Canon cameras, especially Canon digital cameras. It wasn't until recently that a few of my friends were sending me pictures via email that were taken with a Canon Powershot camera. I was pretty impressed with the results and decided to check out the newest Powershot; the S230. This camera packed a lot of features, but kept the bulk to a minimum. Producing images at 3.2 megapixels, the S230 was definitely appealing.WHAT IT COMES WITH:- Canon PowerShot S230 Digital ELPH camera- NB-1LH Lithium-ion battery- 16 MB CompactFlash (CF) Card- USB cable- A/V cable- Wrist Strap- CD with Canon software suite- Users ManualPOCKETABILITY:The first thing you notice about this camera is that it's small. Probably the smallest digital camera I've seen in the 3 megapixel category. You can truly put this in your pocket and not have everyone stare at the bulge...DURABILITY:I've already dropped this camera once on my hardwood floor. Amazingly, it still works like a charm. The S230 is encased in stainless steel with a few chrome accents and a couple of plastic parts (mainly the switches & dials). I expect this camera to last several years without any problems, if not longer. A buddy of mine has owned his Powershot S100 for over two years and he still loves his to death.EASE OF USE:The S230 was as easy to use (if not easier) as my previous Sony digital cameras. Before selling my Sony DSC-S75, I had the chance to compare the two, side-by-side. The size alone, gave the S230 an overwhelming advantage. The picture quality is very impressive with the S230. The indoor photos that I took without the flash turned out great. The auto-exposure, as well as the auto-ISO settings works fine, but if you want to manually set those on your own, it's easy to do. There are other cool features on the S230 such as picture effects (black and white, sepia, soft, sharp, etc.). The 1.5\" LCD is very useful and is very clear, even in bright sunlight.ADVANCED FOCUSING:AiAF (Artificial Intelligence Auto-Focus) is a new feature found on the S230 that was not present in the earlier models of the Powershots. This function allows the S230 to select from one of the nine focus areas within the frame to capture the sharpest shot. It's pretty amazing how this works. This feature can also easily be turned off in the settings. This feature is found on the new Canon G3, as well, and is the flagship of the point-and-shoot digital camera line for Canon.PICTURE QUALITY:As I mentioned, I was quite impressed with the photo quality. I managed to print some of them on photo paper using my HP 960c deskjet printer. Printing them in 5X7 produced brilliant, almost photolab quality pictures. I might add that my Sony DSC-S75 also produces some of the best photos, as well, but I expect that from a camera that boasts a Carl Zeiss Sonar lens, 3.3 megapixel resolution quality.... If you own a Canon printer, you should be able to directly print off of your S230 using the supplied cable. I just ordered the Canon i850 printer, so I'm anxiously waiting to try it out.VIDEO MODE:The ability to capture 30 seconds of 640X480 AVI video (20 frames per second) with sound is awesome! My father was surprised at how clearly it captures motion video. Although you're able to capture the video with sound, you won't be able to play it back with sound on the camera itself, as it is not equipped with a speaker. The S230 is capable of capturing more than 30 seconds if you use smaller resolution. After visiting the Canon Powershot website, I learned that if you use a high-speed CompactFlash (CF) card, you should be able to capture more than 30 seconds of 640X480 video. Canon expects to market the high speed CF card soon.BATTERY STRENGTH:This is where I'd say that my Sony DSC-S75 shines. All of Sony's digital cameras display the remaining life of the battery in minutes. The S230 goes strong until there's about 5% or less power left. I've read a few articles and reviews stating that the battery life is the weakness of this camera, but it's not all that bad. It all depends on how much you use the LCD display, the flash, and how often you turn on/off the device. I quickly ordered an extra battery from buy.com and I'm perfectly happy now.The S230 comes with a separate battery charger. This is very convenient, as you don't have to charge the battery using the camera, like most of the Sony cameras do (Sony sells the battery charger as a separate accessory). From a fully discharged battery, the charger is able to completely charge it in about two hours. There is an LED which displays in `red' when it's charging and `green' when it's complete.OVERALL WEAKNESSES:Some people will say that the small size can be a weakness, but I'd say that the size is definitely its strength. The optical zoom capability is only 2X, so you won't be able to zoom up very closely from afar. It does offer a digital zoom, but this may result in grainy photos. The macro mode of the S230 isn't as crisp as my Sony DSC-S75, but I can live with it. Also, the flash on the S230 isn't as effective as it should be. The flash tends to white out (too bright) close-range subjects, but is very weak for any subjects more than 6 feet away. I'll have to play around some more with the settings, I guess. Finally, the tripod mount is not positioned in the center of the camera. It's actually placed on the side, causing it to be off-center and hard to balance.SUMMARY:I mainly purchased this camera for its size, but it's turned out to be a much better camera than I anticipated. In terms of photo quality, it may not beat the higher-end digital cameras, but it will sure give them a run for the money. We have to hand it Canon for developing a truly pocket-sized 3.2 megapixel digital camera.", "Date": "December 14, 2002"}, {"Title": "A superb, very portable camera", "Author": null, "ReviewID": "R3F3AXVY54C29Y", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This is my third digital camera; I bought this because I wanted an ultra-portable, 3-megapixel camera. So far it's proving to be what I want -- high quality snapshots in a very small package.Likes:- It's truly small; very easy to carry in pocket, coat, briefcase or purse.- Durable steel case- Very easy to use- Very good image quality.- I am very happy with battery life. I do not agree w/folks challenging battery life on this -- I've used it liberally for a whole day of wandering around on vacation, taking photos, looking at images...more than 60 photos in a day. I have bought extra batteries for my other cameras but really haven't felt the need for this. (For me, having a big memory card and extra batteries makes a digital camera much more convenient for heavy picture taking dealing with a film camera and extra film).Dislikes:- Lots of red eye in indoor flash situations- Some difficulty w/autofocus in low-light situations- Relatively limited zoom (however, I don't think moving to the 330 with the 3x zoom is worth the tradeoff in size).Recommendations:- Buy a case. You'll want to carry this everywhere and a little case protects it from scratches and impacts.- Buy at least 128MB memory card (256 even better if you don't want to worry about using up memory on a longer trip)- Having experimented w/lots of digital photo editing software, I like using ofoto.com's software to pull photos off the camera, quickly look at snaps and upload photos online to share. It's very easy for the basics (crop a snapshot, zap out the redeye, upload some photos for sharing or printing 4 * 6's). For more serious editing, I use Adobe Photoshop Elements 2. The Ofoto.com software is free for the downloading off Ofoto's website; the Elements 2 software is reasonable if you take lots of photos and want to learn how to get the most from your photos. I find that Canon's software is too cumbersome for simple tasks and not flexible enough for heavier duty; Ofoto and Elements make a nice combination for me.- If you're really just using this for casual snapshots, consider the Canon s200 for a significant savings. If you aren't going to blow up your photos the S200 would be fine for most simple shots. The 230 is great but may be overkill if you just want a fun, portable camera.", "Date": "December 3, 2002"}, {"Title": "Excellent camera!", "Author": "Trey", "ReviewID": "RV0K4X1B0CAM9", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I have owned this camera for about six months now. I have taken over 2000 pictures with it, and very few have turned out bad. The detail this camera picks up is amazing! I am able to zoom in on objects in the photo and still have good detail.  The 2x optical zoom is very disappointing and has been a limiting factor for some very nice shots while hiking. I have yet to use the included 16MB CF card. I ordered a 512MB CF card the same day I ordered my s230.  At maximum resolution, and maximum quality, it takes over 300 shots! At maximum resolution, and standard quality, it will take 550 shots! (~15 rolls of 36 exposure film!) I have yet to find this to be a problem. A 256MB CF card is really all you need for this camera. A second battery would also be a good idea. You can expect about 100 shots from the battery with the flash and LCD on, along with constantly going to the \ufffdpicture viewer\ufffd mode to show everyone the pictures.The one major drawback that I have not seen mentioned is the mode selector switch. Its on the top-back edge. About 25% of the time when I pull the camera out of my pocket, the switch catches just enough to move from picture mode, to video mode. Then I take a nice video instead of a picture. This issue has been addressed with the s400.I have also seen some complaints about the offset tripod mount and the picture button being on the other end so it shakes when you take pictures on the tripod. You can set the camera timer for two seconds of ten seconds. Set it up for two. Then you push the button, step back, and it takes a perfectly clear shot!I have used many Canon digital cameras; they are a very good choice! Very solid, (I take mine mountain biking every weekend) and it takes great pictures.The 100-240 volt charger works nicely too! Took it to china for a week, and had no trouble at all.", "Date": "November 2, 2003"}, {"Title": "Great Camera and Reasonably Priced", "Author": "IronCan \"ironcan\"", "ReviewID": "R2VTQM828DAWRP", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I just got my Canon s230 from amazon for a real low price.  Anyway, I must say I am very pleased with this little camera.  Here is Why:1)Small yet durable.  Well constructed metal body2)Made in Japan (well know for high quality in electronics)3)Takes video at 640x320 (with sound), very sharp video you just have to see to believe (highest resolution around, better than even higher end cameras like nikons and s50 and s400)4)Softwares as well as camera menus and controls are easy to understand even for beginners.  Instruction manuals are well written as well.5)High resolution LCD screen so you can see your pictures crystal clear (unlike competitions such as Casio and Minolta which have very low quality LCDs)6)9 point AIAF is great technology that allows for nine focus points, and the flexizone even lets you choose which zone you want to focus out of nine, so you don't have to worry about leaving out a part of a beautiful tree or roof of a house just because you want to focus on your friends and family members when taking picture.7)Professional and Efficient customer's service.  If you have a question go to canon website to search for answer.  You can also ask them a question and they get back to you within 24 hours (I was surprised).My Thoughts about Some Complaints Others May Have:1)2x optical zoom: this is a mini point and shoot camera and most of the time you can just stand closer to your subject if you need a closeup.  I mean, I also have a canon s30 which is 3x, but I personally could not justify much advantage with a single x higher. (if you want to see a real difference pickup a 5x-8x optical zoom camera and you will understand my point, but be ready to pay an extra 200+ dollars)2)Red Eye: Small camera means close proximity of flash to shutter = red eye.  What do you expect?  Plus this only happens at night, and can easily be corrected with software provided.3)Technology: which other camera gives you 9 point focus? (not to mention Flexizone). which other brand give you 640x320 video? How often do you actually want video clip longer than 30 seconds? (if you need longer, if would be great idea to buy a camcorder, cause 512mb flash is only going to give you 8min at max)4)Proprietary Battery: I challenge anyone out there to fit 2AA battery in this thing.  There is no way.One misconception I see alot in reviews is that people don't see the overall funtionality and quality of a product base on camera class.  You can't expect this thing to perform like a huge camera, at least not in today's technology.1) Just because a camera has the same 3 megapixel doesn't mean their picture quality are the same ...  Some camera over compress the file so it looks a little grainy at full size, which for me is annoying.Finally, I read numerous reviews and saw various cameras before I finally decided on my s30 and now s230 (my second canon baby brother).  I catergorized digital cameras in general based on overall feature and performance with 1 being the finest and 5 being the most basic as follows: (Note Canon and Nikon are tie at first place)1) Canon (sharpest,most color accurate pictures)1) Nikon (sharp, outstanding macro capability)3) Sony (great laser and lens, picture quality can be better)4) Olympus (AA battery and good picture, high optical too)5) Minolta,Casio,Fuji,Kodak (these you have to enlarge their sample photos to see what I am talking about, and understand why they are in the last place)Don't just take my word.  I encourage you to read more professional reviews.

Gould \"gouldpjaks\"", "ReviewID": "R3UWXNUGWYWXL3", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "There are some faults with the Canon S230 but they don't diminish the overall quality of this little camera.  I previously reviewed this in December when I first purchased it and still rate it as five stars, but I will comment on some disadvantages now.First is the red eye that appears on indoor, flash photos.  This is true of most small digital cameras that I have used.  The problem is the location of the flash close to the lens- unavoidable if you want small size.  I've mitigated this by putting translucent tape or paper over the flash to lessen its impact or taking pictures without flash if possible.The next problem is the battery.  It works great and stays charged through many photos, videos and reviews of my pictures.  It does not let me know when it is about to run out of power.  As soon as the indicator for a low battery comes on the camera dies.  This does not allow much time for changing batteries in the midst of an important event.  My suggestion is to have an extra battery and to always use a newly charged battery for important events.Now for some great features;  I dropped this camera twice onto hard cement and the metal casing and components survived unscathed.  I take this camera with me to sports events, skiing and hiking.  The humidity of our school pool at swim meets has posed no problem.  Its nice to know that it can stand up to even my carelessness.The video clips are great. At an event I simply video each part individually.  Three minutes is long enough for each race in a swim meet- even the relays (Okay, not the 500 free, but my arm would tire from that one anyway). I taped my son's All County orchestra concert- each piece was about three minutes- and even the sound was pretty good. I use a 128 MB card and can get at least a few events on each card.  The 256 MB can do more.So far I'm still very happy with this camera.", "Date": "January 25, 2003"}, {"Title": "great value 3MP compact camera but it is showing its age", "Author": "jemaerca", "ReviewID": "R3IRXOOIGJPQXG", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "it's amazing how fast new products are brought to market, especially in digital photography.  the s230 was the first 3MP in canon stable of ultra-compact cameras.  since then, they have brought out a 4MP s400, a slightly smaller sd100, and an even smaller sd10 (no zoom though). the s230 continues to be a strong performer and pricing has dropped to match the competition.  this camera remains a strong value.pros:- very good photo quality.- uses the same DIGIC image processor found in more expensive canon cameras.- good metering and good tonal balance - maintains shadow detail.- good natural light white balance, strong and balanced colours.- all metal body, solid construction.- low noise at ISO 50 (keep in mind that ISO 50 for this camera is actually ISO 100 for everyone else; likewise, ISO 100 is in reality closer to ISO 200, etc).- the LCD monitor (1.5\") is bright and has an anti-reflective coating - gives good live preview and review even in well lit situations.- shooting priority play mode (a half-press of the shutter release always returns to shooting).- fast shot-to-shot times.- fairly good startup time, especially for an extending lens camera.- minimal shutter lag.- AF assist lamp works well.- USB connectivity.- good battery life, although i would recommend carrying a spare since canon's batteries are proprietary.- as with most canon cameras, documentation and included software are very good.- ultracompact: 3.4 x 2.2 x 1.1 in, weighing only 6.4oz.cons:- limited 2x optical zoom.- redeye performance could be improved.- average macro performance.- average flash performance.- you'll need to remove from tripod to open the battery compartment.- AF Assist lamp doesn't have enough power at telephoto zoom.- very few manual controls - this is okay if all you want is a point and shoot.- RAW and TIFF formats not supported.- the supplied 16MB CF card is inadequate - be prepared to shell out a few more bucks for at least a 256MB card.- proprietary battery - again, a few more bucks for a spare.as already mentioned, the s230 continues to be a good value but there are newer entries in the ultra-compact segment of the market.  if you want 4MP resolution and 3x optical zoom, consider the canon s400 - the eighty dollar premium is well worth it, in my opinion.  more comparable cameras at about the same price point would be the canon s100, pentax optio s, and the casio ex-z3.i hope this helps you with your buying decision.  peace.", "Date": "October 17, 2003"}, {"Title": "BEST \"SMALL CAMERA\" EVER.", "Author": null, "ReviewID": "RMHTJJ02EUXHY", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "My GOD.

The picture quality is not quite as good (a bit more 'noise' is noticeable in night shots) as my Olympus but still much better than my old Kodak DC280.Just as a note to those who can wait: Minolta will soon be releasing the Minolta DiMAGE Xi 3 megapixel version of their popular DiMAGE X camera. This camera is thinner and features a 3x optical zoom as opposed to the 2x zoom on the S230. If it's priced competitively, it might be worth a look.

I was torn between the s330 powershot (which has a 3x Optical Zoom but only 2 megapixels) and the s230 (which has a 2x Optical Zoom and 3.2 megapixels).  This camera will go with me on an upcoming overseas trip, and I was torn by a single question: will megapixels or optical zoom give me a better photo? (as you can see, I am not an aficiando in digicams -- this purchase is actually my very first digital camera).  For me, ultra-portability is a necessity as I need to pack as lightly as possible.  I had decided against Canon's impressive, feature-laden s30 (which is only slightly larger than the s330) because the lens covers on the store models that I had seen had almost been ripped off, and I was concerned that it wouldn't stand up to moderate travel bag abuse (with or without a case).I read every review of the two cameras that I could find, read a zillion newsgroup postings, and asked three people who work with cameras professionally what their opinions were.  I had thought that I had made up my mind to go for the s330 and save myself $100 (the reviews of both cameras are excellent, and I had decided to use the saved $$ to buy accessories).  But the 3 professional opinions that I'd sought out all agreed with buying the s230.  Their reasoning?  If you buy the camera with more megapixels, then when you use the _digital_ zoom to go to 3x, the extra megapixels will help give you the same image that would be gotten from a 2MP + 3x optical zoom combo.  This makes sense if you think about _digital_ zooming as taking a cropped portion of a picture, and simply blowing it up.  More megapixels means more granularity and picture detail -- so taking a piece of an image and making it larger won't affect detail and clarity as much as if you started out with fewer pixels in the first place.  Either way, when I got my hands on a working s230 store model and tested what 2x (optical) and \"3x\" (digital) zoom looked like on that camera, I realized that the difference in what you can see via those telephoto settings isn't that important.  In other words, both 2x and 3x aren't going to let you take a picture of someone from across a field -- they're snapshot quality zooms.So that got me thinking.  I realized, too, that 3.2MP means excellent 8x10 photos.  I don't usually print that large, but hey! this is going to be a once-in-a-lifetime sort of trip, and I wanted the option to make a large print if necessary.  Also, my normal 5x7's would come out supersharp.  And 3MP also means that you can crop and edit pics without nearly as much loss in picture quality.So I bought the s230.  My impressions?The camera takes amazing daytime pics.  I was afraid handshake would be a problem, but I've had no trouble with that at all, except under low light conditions when I try to snap photos without using a flash (and then, it's not really \"shake\" that's the problem -- just lighting).  Oddly enough, despite expectations, I have NOT had red-eye problems...yet.  I've used the preset white balance settings, and my indoor pics have turned out with totally natural colors.  The LCD is awesome.  Panoramic pics are AMAZING (it is such a cool, cool feature).  With the included 16MB CF card, I've taken 45\" of video in 320x640 (I didn't expect to care about this feature, but I've had a BLAST taking quick videos).  As for zoom, I've noticed that, if I take large, superfine shots and then crop what I want to focus on, the resulting image looks the same as if I'd zoomed A LOT.  So, zoom has ended up being a moot purchasing factor for me.All in all, this camera (and it's picture quality) have met and exceeded my expectations.  I was nervous to plunk down $... for something so small and after reading so many mixed reviews, but I have not had one iota of buyer's regret.

I had already been shopping around, and knew what I really wanted was the Canon S30 based on image quality.  I didn't want a camera (like the C3000Z) that required me to \"fix\" the color on every picture I took. (The C3000Z images really weren't that good.)  I quickly sold the C3000Z and held off buying a digital camera for another year until the S30 price came down a bit.Enter the S230, which I ended up buying instead.  I took the S230 with me on vacation to Disney/MGM/Epcot/Islands of Adventure/etc. last week, and I LOVE THIS CAMERA.  The pictures it took make me look like a pro.  Even the night shots of the Epcot laser/light/fireworks show came out spectacular.  What impressed me the most was how quickly the camera was able to take pictures and write them to memory.  The fireworks pictures frame together perfectly, showing a launch, rise, and glorious explosion of each rocket.Other well-done feature include the stitching of pictures into panoramic photos, cropping of videos on-camera, and the overall intuitive design of the buttons and menus.  You can just about use every feature of the camera without ever reading the manual.  Very easy to use.  The LCD display is crisp and relatively easy to view in daylight.  I'd love a slightly larger LCD, but it would make the camera larger and heavier.The battery life (I bought a second one for travel) is excellent, and the charge time is pretty quick, too.  A single charge pretty much lasted me an entire day (14 hrs), which included lots and lots of power cycles (on/off).  I will say that turning the camera on and off eats battery quickly (probably because of the mechanics and such to open the lens), but if you just let the auto-power off do its thing, you'll be happy.  In my case, it rained a fair bit, so I turned it on and off more often.I would like to see some better software included, and I did run into a problem with some corrupted images on one of my CF cards that caused the software to BSOD my system, but I'm sure it's a defective CF card (my other 4 cards work fine).  Still, some error handling would have been nice in the software as opposed to blue-screening my system.  (Try it sometime -- pull the USB cable out while it's transferring pics... boom!)More so, the movies look better than many of the dedicated digital video cameras I've seen in years past.

It lacks a manual focus capability, the zoom range is limited, video record times are somewhat limited, and though its small size is abundantly convenient, it makes holding the camera steady for slow shutter and telephoto shots difficult.Nevertheless, it is a lot of camera for the price.

I just couldn't wait any longer and did my research only to realize the digital camera I really wanted (basically an SLR)is still way out of my price range.I decided to look for a compact camera I would use even if I had that great camera.  One for keeping with me at all times. It needed to be small compact and sturdy.  I have a tendancy to drop things.  Online I did my research and I took a friends Kodak on vacation. While the Kodak was easy to use it has an odd way of compressing memory and the display is not the best so I ruled those out. In the end the S230 fit the bill.  Then I get on here only to read about red eye problems...back to do more research.  I found a site with reviews and photos taken for comparison. Sony's DSC-P9 (4MP) was the best option I came up with but I couldn't get past the soft look to the photos. The Fuji camera's had alot of noise that was visible on screen. (It doesn't show up when you print the photos.)  The Sony had it's share share of noise also.  The Canon's photos were sharp and clear with little visible noise.  I believe even better than some higher MP models. So I decided I could put up with fixing the red eye.Best choice I could have made. This camera is wonderful. It is small, well made and has easy to use buttons.  The features are set up in a logical manner that make them simple to remember. The screen is excellent. The camera does have some weight to it even though it is so small.  I find this to be useful when I'm trying to hold the camera steady to take low light photos.  The camera is quick to turn on and is ready to shoot within seconds.  There are not long delays while it waits to change modes either.There is still the issue with red eye if you are not at the same level and angle with the subject. (And it's alarming) But the software included is super easy to use and takes care of the problem better than the Adobe softwares I've used in the past.  The pictures download fast and are stored in folders by the date taken.  Perfect for sequencing pictures of the kids.The battery life is excellent but when the warning light comes on you've only got about 60 seconds to take that last picture. The battery takes 2 hours to charge from empty. The charger fits directly into the outlet and stores flat. (No cords!) The extras you'll need (Including a reader so you won't waste battery life on downloads) will add a third or a forth to the cost of this camera. The movies are fun and easy to send to family. There are also some manual picture taking features that are useful to get good pictures in low light without the flash.I've had the camera for 2 weeks and I really can't say enough about the quality.", "Date": "February 26, 2003"}, {"Title": "Reasons why you may not like this camera", "Author": "J.

I know 'cuz I've tried 5 other cameras before deciding to keep this one for good.  I've tried the Kodak DX4900, DX6340, Minolta S414, Canon PowerShot S45, and the Sony DSCP8.  This camera beats all the others I've tried either in size, weight, ease of use, and/or autofocus ability.  Most reviews I read here tells you what's good about this camera.  I think it's important to list all the negative things about this camera, so you can make a better informed decision.  Here goes...1. Short battery life.  At full charge, the bundled 840mAH battery last for around 30 pictures (with LCD screen on).  Buy a 1000mAh battery ... it last much longer.2. Autofocus works 90% of the time.  The other 10% of the time, you'll get fuzzy pictures, regardless whether it is inside or outside.  I find this acceptable since the other cameras I've tried only produced well focused pictures 80% or less of the time. (The DX4900 produced well focused pictures 99% of the time)3. Red eye.  I get many more red eye pictures with this camera than I do with others.  This perhaps has something to do with the fact that the flash is very close to the lens.  This is acceptable to me 'cuz I have software that can solve this easily.4. 512MB card only gives 308 pictures at 3.2MP and the best quality mode.  I was able to get 209 pictures with a 256MB CF card in the DX4900 when set at 4MP and best quality.  The math just doesn't add up...I thought I would get at least 400 pictures with the S230.5. Battery door easiy pops open.  It lacks a battery door lock so you can open the door easily.  There is however a lock to keep the battery from falling out.6. Zoom is insufficient.  2x zooming is certainly not enough for times zooming is needed.  Two cameras I own in the past had 4x zooming and I certainly love to have that in this camera.7. Very very close-ups cannot focus at all.  I tried taking a picuture of the serial number on my pen and it simply would not focus.  I tried that with my DX4900 and it was able to focus on the serial number.8. Casing scratches easily.  I found a number of visible scratches two days after using it.  I tried very hard to handle this well and even bought a case to hold it.  But it still is vulnerable to scratching.9. Controls and menu options are fairly complicated to use.  You really have to read the manual to use this well.All in all, this camera is an excellent camera.  I love most of the features on this camera and finds it as a keeper.  The other cameras I've tried cannot match up to this camera.  You simply can't go wrong buying this camera.

Some shots I have taken seem a bit blurry, when I know the subject was focused properly. Mostly low light shots it seems. The size is perfect. Stealthy. Keep it in your pocket and only those with a keen eye notice when you pull it out. You'll be taking more shots than you ever thought possible.Manual control of the camera is also powerful for a small point and shoot. There is a long shutter setting up to 15 seconds. There are manual exposure, white balance and ISO settings. Macros are good. The panorama setting is awesome, string together many picts for a great 360 shot. Movies are good too. Long! Best of all I love how the camera remembers its last setting so that when you power it off and back on it's right where you left it.Some issues however:1. The flash is weak. It's good if your just feet away from the subject, but that's about it. If you want to catch something in the distance at night your going to have to turn the flash off and pump up the exposure.

I love the S400, with the 4 megapixel sensor and the 3X optical zoom, but I just don't understand the thinking behind a 2X optical zoom like the S230 has.  If you are looking for a small durable digital camera in the same price range check out the Olympus Stylus 300.  You give up sound with your video mode, but most people don't care.  It has a 3X optical zoom and it is weatherproof.  Another one of my favorites is the Samsung V3.  Check your specialty photo retailer, because you won't find this gem at a big box store.  It is a 3.2 megapixel, 3X optical zoom camera with a three year warranty and a Schneider glass lens.

Even Fuji is not as good, as their movies are overly compressed, even though they tout 30fps versus 15fps for the Canon.My main reason for buying this camera was the movie mode and I was not disappointed.  I went on a 2 1/2 week European trip in July and took at least 200-300 movies in the full 640x480 mode.  The limit for each clip is 30 seconds.  I put together a movie for each country by editing together individual clips.  I have movies now as long as 15 minutes.  Oh yeah, I also took pictures <g>.  I took a total of 12 gigabytes for movies and pictures.  They turned out fantastic.  Since I only had one 512meg card, and three 256 meg cards, I brought along a portable hard drive that is specifically built to hold up to 20 gigs of pics and movies from your cameras flash cards.

This is a very popular, ultra-compact 3 MPixel 2x zoom camera. I won't do a full review of it, but here are some quick impressions. Overall I'm pretty awed by this camera. My wife took great photos with it, and she is neither a photo geek nor a computer geek. I highly recommend it. (Canon has since introduced the s400, which is one step up from this camera -- 3x zoom and 4 Mpixel -- for more money.)It is incredibly small, feels very solid and tough. The model I bought is made in Japan. There are extensive manuals - with one major error: the manual doesn't make clear that to get the \"continuous shooting\" and \"infinity shot\" behaviors you have to switch from \"automatic\" to \"manual\" mode\". These modes are mislabelled; they should be \"simplified\" and \"standard\" mode. In the default \"automatic/simplified\" mode a number of the controls don't work (white balance, infinity, continuous shot). In the \"automatic/standard\" mode all the controls work. It took me a while to figure this out, the documentation really fell short on this critical point.It supports the EXIF Orientation Tag. A sensor in the camera is used to document camera position at the time of image acquisition.Uses CompactFlash, same AV output and data cable as the G2, the same desktop software and very similar camera interface and operations and similar CF card format. So if you are familiar with a G2 (or G1, G3) this is almost your only logical choice.Battery is very small, very nice charger that plus directly into a wall outlet (would not fit well on a surge suppressor). I think you really need two batteries with this camera. Note that even though the charger is reasonably elegant it's almost as big as the camera! The charger can handle 110/220V and 50/60 Hz.Since a camera-plug charger is an unnecessary optional add-on, you really want to use a CF Card reader with your PC and don't bother using the data cable. My favorite CF card reader is hardly larger than the USB data cable, and arguably easier to transport.Canon made a very nice case for this camera, the PSC 300, that was sold on Amazon for $...! It had a small pouch for a flash card. Naturally, it was discontinued. It's been replaced by the PSC-50, which is even smaller.

As far as I am aware, there is no digital still camera that can compete with the sharp resolution of the movie clips this camera can produce (though Canon's Powershot A70 comes close).Who would guess that a camera this tiny would win the prize in that department? Yet it's true. I was considering going with this camera's 4 megapixel sibling, the s400. Yet ironically and weirdly, that camera, which is supposed to represent an upgrade to this one, has only a lower-quality video capability. [Who at] Canon...made that decision?I don't want to give the impression that this camera's video can compete with that of a real video camera. Be prepared for these limitations:1) In the highest resolution setting (recommended), each clip is limited to a maximum of 30 seconds. It is 3 minutes in the lower settings.2) Settings like focusing, zoom, and exposure do not adjust during a video clip. This means that if your subject starts out in the shade and shifts to a bright setting, it may look overexposed.3) The recorded sound of the video is not great, with some hiss always audible and pronounced wind noise in a breeze.4) You don't get the 30fps of a real video camera, so the motion is not as smooth-looking.5) No digital stabilization. Hold the camera very steady or use a tripod.6) You need lots of memory to record videos, approximately 1MB per second. I purchased two 512 MB flash cards. Each can record over 8 minutes of video clips, or hold over 300 highest-resolution photos. A 512 costs a little over $100 right now.Despite these limitations, the extreme portability of this camera has convinced me to use it for most of my video shooting. The 30-second time limit is not as bad as you might at first think. Even when using my dedicated video camera, I doubt I have taken many shots of greater length. The ones that are longer are boring anyway.And I have found a solution to the terrible wind noise. By putting the smallest bandaid I could find over the tiny dot of a microphone (to serve as a wind screen), the wind noise was completely eliminated without, amazingly, cutting down the audibility of other sounds.Being able to take photographs when appropriate, and videos when appropriate, with the flip of a switch from the same tiny camera that you can take anywhere, is wonderful.

The build and overall quality are great, the camera is small, but feels very solid.  Another pleasant aspect is the number of professional-like manual features the camera packs.  From my point of view, the only primary \"professional\" feature that's not there is aperture/shutter priority.

I've always been fascinated by these cameras and their carryability, but being a person who likes image quality I waited and waited (and waited) until Canon finally came through with the S230 with 3.2 megapixels. What a great camera, I bought it just before going on a week long snowboarding trip to Canada. Litteraly took it everywhere. It performed nearly flawlessly in every situation. It handled the cold & condensation just fine, and night shots at the bars came out great. The only small gripe I have is that the 9 point autofocus does wierd things, causing the occasional blurred shot. The improvement of the movie mode (now you can shoot 3 minutes instead of only 30 seconds at 320x240, as well as the ability to shoot 640x480) was a great move on Canon's part. The microphone does well except in loud or windy situations where the audio will clip. The only weak part on the camera body is the compact flash door which is plastic, a friend broke his off. Software: Most of the software works ok, the only thing that works kindof iffy on my machine (win2k) is the zoombrowser software. I went out and spent $20 on a usb compactflash card reader and now use that to transfer my pictures, plus it works as a portable disk to tranfer other files between home/work/friends. You can get 128mb flash cards for about $40 now, definitely pick one up, the 16mb card is useless except as a backup. An extra battery would be helpful, or just carry the charger (it's the same size as the camera) and charge it up at lunchtime or some other downtime.

Shortly after I bought it, I took some pictures at the highest resolution, and had them professionally developed to 11x13 size.  The quality of the photo was outstanding!  The photo was crystal clear, and I'm certain that I could have blown it up further.  I previously owned a Kodak 2.0 mp, and although it took nice pictures, the delay (from pushing the button to the time the picture recorded) was nearly unbearable.  I constantly missed photo ops of my new baby in action.  My Kodak also began having problems after 18 months (what a dissapointment- of course it was then out of warranty).  The S230 is lightening quick, and the recovery (from shot to shot) is also extremely fast.  I found the software to be very intuitive, as well as easy to install (I'm running XP).  Although I have other photo software, I am using the Cannon software, because I find it that functional.  I did a lot of research in the way of compact cameras, before this puchase.  I considered the Sony Cyber Shot (average response time, and very high price), the Minolta Dimage(got sub-par reviews for quality of photo).  Three people in my family own the s200's, and have been thrilled with them for over 1 yr.  The proprietary battery concerned me prior to my purchase, but I have been extremely pleased with the battery performance.  I have not had the need to purchase a spare.  I set up the camera (fooling with ALL of the settings), took over 100 photos, reviewed them MANY times, and downloaded them from the camera, before I had to recharge the battery!  The battery also fully recharges in about 1 1/2 hours.  One neat extra: the camera has a gravity sensor that \"remembers\" the orientation of your photos, so they are always \"right side up\".  In low light conditions, the camera has performed far beyond my expectations (compensating with a very good flash).  Because of the compact size (and flash proximity to the shutter, red eye is occasionally a problem (although no more so then other ultra-compact cameras), and can be fixed with the software.  However red-eye is certainly no worse then my HUGE Kodak camera was.

That day, I decided that when the 3 MP version (the S230) came down a little in price, I would buy one.Now that I got the camera, I am even more amazed.  It is a precision instrument.  For the camera itself, probably its only limitation is the 2x zoom.  However, with the digital zoom, you get 6.4x.  Granted, with the digital zoom, the pictures can get grainy.  However, with 3 megapixel, the digitally zoomed pictures are still better than with my old 1.2 megapixel camera which made decent 4x6 shots.I had problems installing the software on my home PC which runs Windows XP (it is a three year old PC).  The Installshield failed.  I contacted Canon and they gave me a suggestion that didn't work.  Upon contacting them again, they told me it was a Windows problem and told me to contact Microsoft.  I was not happy about that.Luckily, I already had a CF reader which I use to get the pictures onto the PC which is probably a good investment anyway.  I also use Photoshop Elements 2.0 which is better than the software they give.  The software did install on my laptop running Windows XP, but still Photoshop Elements is better than theirs and it is easier using a separate CF reader than using the Canon-supplied cable.Even with my software problems, this camera still rates 5 stars.

The lens, while zooming, is a bit noisy, but bearable, and the camera won't remember my flash preference in auto mode for some reason after turning it off.  One feature I love is being able to zoom in on a photo in playback mode.  Blurry shots often look sharp when they are reduced in the screen, but you can blow up certain areas to see if it is sharp or not.  This is useful for knowing which photos to throw out.  The bundled software is absolute garbage.  It is buggy, slow, and counterintuitive.  To transfer images, (assuming you have a laptop) get a seven-dollar pcmcia card adapter.

I really liked it at first.  When I took it to Cancun, it was great for taking photos of Mayan ruins and such.  But the longer I have it, the more the drawbacks irritate me.The biggest drawback is that in anything less than direct sunlight the CCD SUCKS.  I have a horrible time getting good focus even just in the shade of a tree.  Indoors I get a lot of digital artifacts.  With my previous camera, a Canon Powershot A50, it was wonderful in low-light applications, very clear, very sharp, very good color.There is the flash, but it isn't the best.  I still end up with soft (fuzzy) photos with a flash indoors, and if I'm close to the subject it often ends up being washed out.  I consider myself a fairly advanced amateur photographer and have tried all sorts of automatic and manual settings to improve it indoors to no avail.At this point I am beginning to review other cameras because I need to replace this.  The \"low-light\" drawbacks (that's in quotes because it's not so much a low-light problem as a less than extreme sunlight problem) make the image quality too embarassing to share photos from family functions.  I used to be proud of the photos I took indoors at family functions and now I only share them reluctantly.That said, the small size and the fast startup and shot speeds are great.

Also, look into reviews and actual pictures when comparing digital cameras. Some people will just compare features, which isn't going to cut it. CCD sensor and lense quality will often outweigh the importance of how many megapixels the camera has.Problems with this camera:Artifacts, or circles from low-light flash pictures. These are by far the most annoying problem with the camera, and I can spot them out in quite a few shots. But keep in mind, that many small digital cameras with a flash close the lense suffer from this problem. If you really have to have a small, compact camera, then this may not be such an issue.Red-eye. Another problem with small cameras that have a flash close to the lense. This camera offers a red-eye reduction, which helps quite a bit, but these features often cause subjects to close their eyes or move from the initial flash. Once again, this is common for small cameras, so I'm not going to hold it against Cannon for this problem.Proprietary battery: Its expensive, in case you wanted to buy spare batteries.2x zoom: Its hard to get a decent zoom lense in a small camera. When you are dealing with something this size, 3x zoom is asking for a lot. Once again, I forgive Cannon for this.Good CCD sensor. Outdoor shots come out well.Tough body, with a light lense cover. Small enough to fit in your pocket. Though some reviewers complain of the tripod mount, I find they placed it fairly well to allow for some tripod users to change the battery while the camera is mounted or when using the AC battery dummy adapter. Incase you were wondering, this is why the tripod mount is offset, and it would have been difficult to place it any further from the battery compartment due to the small size of the camera.Autofocus is ok, but the ability to switch between compound and spot metering/focus will help you take better pictures. The feature is conviniently located and all users should learn how to lock focus and light meter.Filming is pretty decent. The reason you have a 3 minute/30 second max recording time is because the film is stored in the buffer before writing to the CF card. This buffer also allows for quick snapshots without waiting for write times, or continuous action shots.I could go on about every feature but it has been covered. If you can't deal with the artifacts, red-eye, and 2x zoom, then look for a bigger camera. If you have to have a small camera, then this camera will be a fine choice.

It takes great pictures, uses a rechargeable battery and is great on battery life.  I go about 6 months without having to recharge the battery. I would say I take a medium amount of pictures.Recently Dec. 2007, I went to go take a picture and the screen was blank with a few purplish lines running through it.. My icons showed up, but there wasn't anything in the LCD. When viewing playback pictures, those pictures show up in the view finder.  I recharged the battery and tried again, same thing.  For a while, I thought I would have to get a new camera.I called Canon support (for the other reviewer, I found the number very easy to find, 1-800-828-4040.) After going through their voice prompts, I got a customer service person right away. No wait! Plus, the rep was in Virginia, so there weren't any of the typical issues that happen when customer support is located in India (like HP).I described the problem, the rep helped me reset the camera, it worked for a few seconds. The rep told me to keep taking pictures for a few more seconds, because the fix may be temporary, and sure enough, the picture went blank again. (IMHO, most customer service departments would try to get me off the phone the second it started working again).Long story short, there is a service advisory out on this camera, it turns out that the \"image sensor\" may malfunction. Canon is paying for the shipment back to them and they will fix it for free. No muss, no fuss. It didn't even matter that I had the camera for almost 4 years.  This was one of the best customer service experiences I have ever had.If your camera starts acting up like this, call Canon right away.**update 1/12/08 ***Canon was not able to fix my camera so they sent me a BRAND new one, a SD900 , a much much better camera. My camera was not under warranty anymore, but since it was the \"image sensor\" issue, Canon still covered it. Amazing customer service, very rare these days.

Sure, some other cameras flaunt their miniscule size and weight, but this camera beats those all in what matters:  photo quality.  Crisp and clear!--It is small!  Perfect for putting in a pocket without worrying you'll lose it.  Sturdy and stylish exterior, and lots of easy-to-use features (such as movie mode) are on the camera.--It has optical zoom.  Although the zoom may only extend to 2X, it is still useful.  An unless you are taking extreme close ups all the time, it's all you really need.--The price is amazing!  I looked at the competitors, and you cannot find this combination for under $300.  Some of the more expensive models are bulkier, come with smaller memory cards, or don't have optical zoom!  The price is likely low because Canon came out with the SD100 to basically replace this camera, but that has some problems with it and doesn't have better features (except for a special chip that prevents erased photos.

I carry the book with me at all times, because this has so many features that I can't keep them all in my head!  I've taken great snapshots with it on the fly, as well as some pretty nice \"arty\" pictures.I love the digital because I can review each picture before I decide whether or not I've captured the EXACT shot I want.  Much better than taking 5 pictures, hoping I got the one I want, and waiting for the film to come back.  Also much more cost-effective.  For anyone debating about whether to go digital, I'd recommend this camera.  I think the first one has about paid for itself by now in saved developing and film costs.

This is indeed an awesome camera, great fun for the money!  The video feature for under $400 is well worth it.  I do not regret getting it.However, my biggest complaint is on the [poor]software shipped with the box.  (Please Note:  I use Windows 2000/SP3, so do many other users).  Here's a list:1)  The USB connection [is weak]!  It's connected, but it doesn't detect so unless you switch some buttons on the camera to \"excite\" it!This is fustrating sometimes.  I mean, without a good connection, what good is a digital camera?  This problem is constant with all three of my machines at home.  However, I admit this is a minor problem, and might be fixed by upgrading my system software.The next problem is by far much worse:2)  The software is of very low quality.Did canon save cost py outsourcing to some poor country to code it?  Why would a device driver need to be 25MB and a simple program need 100MB?  It is buggy as hell and runs very slowly.Figure out how to download the avi video clips yet?  The software doesn't let you do that.  Even the so called \"video editing\" software doesn't let you do that!3)  The resulting photos are really high quality, however I noticed that they tend to be a lot darker when transfered to the computer.  It looked a lot brighter (and nicer) on the LCD screen on the camera.  The samething applies for the video clips.  There's nothing in the manual to fix this problem.. I mean, how come the downloaded images look dramatically different from the one you preview on the LCD screen?This is what I ended up doing to get around these problems:1)  You get used to the USB thing :)  Or spend an extra 30 bucks to get a CF card reader.  It's not that big of a problem... reallyUse other standard photo-editing software to mess with your images.For video files, I recommend converting to DIVX format using the program \"VirtualDub\" right away (decrease the file size to 10% of the original), and then using other programs to make it into MPEG VCD format if you want (so you can make a VCD to see it on TV)3)  Use \"gamma correction\" in any software to correct the light/darkness problem with any good software (ie, not canon's).  For video files, there's a filter in the VirtualDub program that lets you correct the brightness/contrast of the video clip, so mess around with that.  I got pleasant results afterwards.  However, ordinary users (like granddad) don't need to do these things!!I would definately give this camera 4-5 stars if they made the software more pleasant for me.  But overall, it is a very good camera.  They definately spent a lot of time on the camera itself.

A number of people have expressed complaints or problems. I thought I'd describe some of my own experiences.I recently bought the camera for work, along with an extra battery and a 256MB CF card. In initial testing I was very impressed with the clarity of the pictures, though I changed the white balance for indoor pictures. I took 110 pictures of varying sizes and 3 movies of about a minute each (much more than I expected, based on reviews I've read of battery life). This week my wife and I went to Disneyland. I brought the camera, the empty CF card and both charged batteries. I took 182 pix at max size/min compression without depleting the first battery! Ultimately, I got 328 pictures over a period of two weeks - about half taken with flash. I kept the LCD display off the whole time, except for the two-second review display in the LCD after you take a picture and the status icons which appear when you change something (like turning the flash off or forcing infinity focus).The review display defaults to 10 seconds, but as I grew comfortable with the camera I changed it to 2 seconds -- partly to conserve battery life, but also because you can't do anything with the camera until the display clears. By the last day of our trip, I had turned if off entirely due to the discovery of an undocumented feature: if the LCD and review settings are both off, and you keep the shutter button pressed after taking your image, the image will be displayed for a few seconds. This has the potential to decrease the time between shots if you're busy taking several in a row in a short time.I have an SLR 35mm camera and two point-and-shoot's. Though I like looking through the lens to exactly frame a picture in the SLR, I've learned with the point-and-shoot's to see as the camera does and not worry about the viewfinder. I took this point-and-shoot approach with the S230 and it works fine. If you think \"digital camera\" means \"looking at an LCD display to frame your picture,\" I urge you to rethink this. It will mean far less worry about the battery. It should be noted though, as it is elsewhere, that the \"weak battery\" icon doesn't come on until the battery is pretty much dead, which means you could end up in the lurch if you don't have a spare; but the battery life is less of a problem than I thought.In different stores I took many macro mode close-ups with the flash off, which requires a slow shutter setting for the dim light. They weren't as blurry as I thought they'd be, and a couple came out great. A pocket tripod would make the blurriness problem moot, of course. A curious feature of CCD digital cameras you need to understand is that longer exposures create grainier (more artifacts) pictures, exactly the opposite of what you can get with film. Flash pictures of 8-foot circular displays, taken from 4 or 5 feet back, came out quite well, and hand-held macro pictures under sufficient light were very nice.I switched from auto mode to manual (mostly to access the white balance settings) early on. When turning on the camera in manual mode, you only have to think about a few things: Whether to set infinity focus (in situations where you're shooting something more than 10 feet away and don't want to wait for the auto-focus); whether to set macro mode for sharp close-ups up to 1.5 feet away (not commonly used, but handy); and whether to turn the flash on or off. To review several pictures you've taken, just flick the mode switch from photo to review.Images will tend to have more contrast than you see with your eye, a bit more than with film. If you're within 8 to 10 feet, use a fill flash. Alternately you can work with images in the provided software (Photoshop Elements). For example, I shot some photos of the Small World exterior late in the afternoon. The sun shone brightly off the white building, and the shrubs and waiting area were in shadow. I aimed at the building and half-pressed the shutter to set the auto-exposure. In that image, the building looked fine, but the shadows were were almost black, even though they were easily visible to my eye. In a second photo, I aimed the camera at the shadows to set the auto-exposure, and then aimed at the building and took the picture. In this image, the building and surrounding area was completely washed out, but the shrubs and passing boats in the darker areas were much more distinct. I fixed the first image in Photoshop, but the second image couldn't be saved. I did this to test the camera's limits, but the best solution would have been to come back and shoot it in the morning. A common \"bad photo\" problem is not understanding when you need to recompose a shot, change the lighting (or wait for better lighting), or not accepting that you just can't get certain photos to come out.For those special photos it's still not time to replace my SLR, or even my point-and-shoot APS camera. But for the size, weight, and quality of images, even though I purchased the camera for work, I'm very happy with it and will use it for personal uses as well.", "Date": "March 20, 2003"}, {"Title": "The Best Camera I ever bought !!", "Author": "Fernando", "ReviewID": "R11Z0LXWPBK4RP", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Without a doubt this is the best camara I ever bouhgt.

After reading the reviews, I expected that this camera would take good pics, albeit not in the same league as my 10D.  However, to date, I have found the pics grainy and lacking color detail.  I have switched to manual and set the ISO to 50.  Perhaps that will solve the problem. I suspect camera may be defective because no one else has suggested the pics are grainy. One other problem--the camera does not have a battery meter, so you cannot tell when the battery needs re-charging.  This is a major design flaw.  On a good note--the build quality is excellent.  The camera is responsive, although there is a lag with the pics and the buffer. I may wait for Kyocera to perfect their ultra-compacts, because they have recently developed a chip that will load directly to the SD media, and lag is not an issue.", "Date": "December 25, 2003"}, {"Title": "very nice", "Author": null, "ReviewID": "RQYJRWUHUJ1I9", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "i bought this camera for my sister who is obsessed with coach purses. she cant thank me enough. if buying for a female, definantly purchase coach carrying case.

The change here was to increase resolution from 2 megapixels to 3.2 megapixels. Otherwise, its features were much the same: a slick looking steel body, a proprietary battery & charger, a too-tiny memory card and a 2X optical zoom and a (not very useful) 3X digital zoom. All of the Canon models (I've owned 4) have been durable and all of them take good pictures.By now the 230 has been surpassed in most areas by cameras costing more or less the same amount of money. Higher resolutions, longer optical zooms, faster image handling (meaning less time btwn shots) and better battery conservation are now commonplace. Perhaps more devastating to the elan of these Canons is the plain fact that their diminutive size appeal has been lost to cameras featuring all of the above advancements in packages that make the 230 seem like a leviathan (the Pentax Optio & Minolta DiMage being two good examples).If you already have an S230 or someone gives you one, you have nothing to complain about. It's a reliable and capable camera.

Small size was most important to me as I had been using a SLR full size before this, and found that for the money i had spent on that camera, it was not being used to its fullest potential- simply because it is not the type of camera for the amateur photographer- too large and not practical.The elph range seemed the most appealing, especially when considering the features. My only gripe at the time was that it was without a higher MP range.As soon as i found out the s230 had come out, it was certain that this was the upgrade i wanted. The Elph is a fantastic package, with its small size and solid build being its greatest advantages (among so many others). As most other reviewers have stated, it has a rather weak flash, and its low-light pictures aren't as good (as with the s200)- but its when those quick \"point-and-shoot\" moments come along that this camera shines its brightest. There's no fidgeting, and no long start up. Just turn it on and take the picture.Now, if only Canon can squeeze a higher optical zoom into this little wizard.....!Strongly recommend this camera for the amateur/start up digital photographer.
