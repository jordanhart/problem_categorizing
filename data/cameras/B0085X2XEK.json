It will do any and all that an amateur would like to do but it is not going to replace a studio camera. I love this camera, got one after using a friends to shoot a couple of events. I can easily see myself using this to do family pics or event pics but don't start marketing yourself as a pro with this one. It has an excellent battery life and durability. You will want to play with your own settings instead of the auto features, it gets it wrong more often than naught.", "Date": "February 12, 2013"}, {"Title": "Fantastic Camera with Guide that makes picture taking easy", "Author": "Richard Holley JR", "ReviewID": "R311PWDU2IYD96", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I love this Nikon camera.  It takes great pictures and is user friendly.  When in doubt, the Guide Mode takes care of you. Performs as well or better than my professional cameras and takes excellent pictures in Auto. Nikon lenses are excellent matches to this high quality 24.2 MP Camera. I love the weight and how it fits in my hand.  Nikon is the only Camera I buy.", "Date": "June 22, 2013"}, {"Title": "returned for the d5200", "Author": "Rob", "ReviewID": "R1JKZFUH9BIK16", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "returned the d3200 for the d5200 and was worth the extra money, the 5200 is all around better, reacts faster. seemed that the 3200 would randomly make you wait a second to take a pic when trying to take pictures fast, where as the 5200 is much more responsive and doesn't miss a pic.", "Date": "June 20, 2013"}, {"Title": "Good semiprofressional camera", "Author": "Dianne C Dixon", "ReviewID": "R1OQO7XZ4Y8NS4", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I like the functionality of this camera as it is easy to operate but it is not as I expected it to be.  I am used to a more professional camera and this one you are limited to what all you can do.. It is overall a good camera and well worth the price .
