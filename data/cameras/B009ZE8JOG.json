Bottom line it's an easy camera to point and shoot, takes fabulous clear pictures with excellent color.  I use the viewfinder with it since I don't like taking shots using the screen.  Pictures are extremely clear, and resolution is perfect.", "Date": "June 5, 2013"}, {"Title": "Not a bad camera, but expensive for what it is.", "Author": "Jensen A. Lau", "ReviewID": "R32N9MT0BCVEZQ", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "This was a nice camera, but I don't think it was worth the price tag.  I felt any ISO above 1600 was extremely grainy.  I'm not really sure why the ISO goes above 6400 because the quality is pretty bad at 3200.", "Date": "November 21, 2013"}, {"Title": "The Best Small Digital Camera Brings Professional Quality Shots", "Author": "Yan Yang", "ReviewID": "R2I0Y8QFQ1YC7L", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This is the best small digital camera you can ever find.
