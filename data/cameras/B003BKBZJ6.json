The pictures are clear and true. The only thing that is a problem, (and I hope someone might be able to help me on this),is that when I download the photos to my computer, they disappear from the camera! The manual does not say anything about this; and I cannot believe that you can lose your photos from the camera without wanting to.

A simple \"auto/smart\" mode takes the guessing out of your hands but you can easily change settings.  Also, if you do not understand a setting, there is an easy tutorial in the camera itself.  It's a \"help\" option in the setting.  I got it for my parents whom are not tech capable but good for all levels of users.  Also, 12 MP is too large for them.  The photos take up alot of memory on your computer so it is nice to have an option that allows you to save it as a 3, 5, 8 MP.. so on.  5 to 8MP is plenty for them and with a 4gig  memory card, you can save 2000 + photos on the card.  Got it at Best Buy on sale for 69 bucks.  I only wish there was a view finder.

Let me say that this is the best digital camera I've ever owned. It's small, easy to carry around, and if you know what you're doing-you can take some really professional shots with this! Granted, a simple digital camera does not match up to a real professional camera, but this one is pretty good.I've seen a few people complain about the battery life. Well, this is only a problem if you use the flash often. I almost never use the flash, and my battery will last me about a month before it needs charging. However, the more you use flash-the more it needs charging. Remember, flash takes up a pretty big chunk of battery life.Just like every other digital camera out there, this one does not come with a SD card; you'll have to buy one yourself. Thankfully, you can get them pretty cheap somewhere OTHER than Best Buy. I suggest either on Amazon or at Wal-Mart.If you're a beginner, then this camera is a great choice! You can set it to AUTO Mode if you don't know what you're doing; the camera will automatically choose the F Stop, flash, and try to make the picture as clear as possible. However, if you're an intermediate and know your way around a digital camera, then you can set everything manually and get some pretty nice shots. (To get the best shots I recommend picking the LARGEST photo size and the SUPER FINE quality. Yes, your pictures be huge files-but if you have photo editing software then you can re-size them without losing quality. Oh, and get a tripod as well-it really helps.)The only downside is that this camera is pretty slow when I connect it directly to my laptop. This would be a problem if I didn't have a SD Card Slot. It runs a lot faster and is easier to use than connecting the entire camera to a computer. If you have to pick between a USB port and a SD Card Slot-go with the SD Slot.All in all, this is a very nice camera for somebody who wants something with good quality, but doesn't want to spend a huge amount of money.", "Date": "October 6, 2011"}, {"Title": "Only for close-ups.", "Author": "Crusadergurl", "ReviewID": "R1X4L6NNSQKW4X", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "I bought this camera when it was new on the market. At first I really liked it. I took a few close-up images and man they were amazing! Truly spectacular! .... And then I started taking group photos, outings, parties. Pictures taken outside are awful. I hate it and am so disappointed in Samsung. I tried different settings, aperature, everything. To most people they probably wouldn't care, but I'm extremely picky. My first camera was a Fuji, before they were Finepix, it was 5MP and took amazing photos. This one, which is 12MP, is easily worse. On the camera they look relatively okay, but when you load them on the computer and you can see the image better, you can see the lines aren't so sharp and in some photos there's almost a glare. Not really sure how to describe it. Buyer, please beware.", "Date": "July 25, 2011"}, {"Title": "Worth the money", "Author": "Michelle L.

Found this on sale a few months ago at Best Buy. To be honest I just wanted cheap and easy. Have been pleasantly surprised at the great pictures this takes especially in low lighting. With a quick change to the setting I can snap a picture in a room with barely any light and it looks like a sunny daylight picture. Simple to load up to PC with a simple cord that came with it and it charges at the same time while I go through the pictures. Really good zoom fixture, plus a \"shake hand\" fixture which is perfect for me. Best fixture is being able to choose the size of pics, one especially for use online versus same size for all.

Unfortunately, after a recent trip to Chico my poor little camera took a pretty hard fall to the face. Now the lens won't open :( Keep in mind this is probably the 20th time I've dropped it and it just now stopped working. I am seriously considering getting the same exact camera in a different color for my replacement. Here's my breakdown:Pros:-Quality, clear pictures-Beauty shot mode - my favorite feature! Beauty shot \"perfects\" your skin, making close-up pictures flawless- \"Auto\" will automatically choose the best settings for whatever picture you are taking-Tons of different options such as sunset, beach, nighttime, firework (although I've tested the firework setting and it's not the greatest!)-Pretty cute and compact, fits in my pocket-Price (got it for 100 bucks at best buy, looks about the same price on here)Cons:-Doesn't come with a memory card, and until you buy one it will only store ONE picture-When it's on the \"beauty shot\" mode, it takes a LONG time for the picture to show up - will say \"Processing\" for at least 30secs-1 minute..uncomfortable when you take a picture and they want to see it right away, you have to wait quite a while for it to come out!-Another con of the \"beauty shot\" mode is that if you aren't taking a close up picture, it comes out very blurry. You also have to hold it steady for a few seconds AFTER the flash to ensure it comes out clear.Battery life is pretty good. Not the greatest, but not annoyingly short either. Charger is short and easy to carry around, just plugs into the wall. Zoom is the same, enough zoom to work fine for me!Overall the pros outweigh the cons by far, and I absolutely love this camera. perfect for first time digital camera users or anyone who doesn't wanna spend bank on a camera! :)", "Date": "May 15, 2011"}, {"Title": "good overall", "Author": "Edmond Ramirez \"eddy3735\"", "ReviewID": "R17LDRW7DSZDYB", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "this is a nice camera, it takes wonderful pictures and has 5X optical zoom which is a great deal for the price.", "Date": "April 12, 2011"}, {"Title": "My cell phone takes better pics (Samsung Epic)", "Author": "Bellabuys", "ReviewID": "RI2B0Y1Y5ERWE", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "It's a pretty camera at a really cheap price but none of the pictures I've taken with this camera have been frame worthy.

Stutts", "ReviewID": "R1TH8Z9SJJ7AJA", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "I killed my previous camera (an older Fuji Finepix S3000) with an unfortunate baptism with hot cocoa. Well and truly dead. Forever. Lucky me, it happened right before Thanksgiving so I capitalized on Black Friday or Cyber Monday or something to latch onto a new camera.The specs on this Samsung  were better than my previous Fuji. The picture quality is worse though. I have not yet gotten any satisfying pictures after 2 whole months of adjusting things, If everything holds still, and you have the anti-shake on and the pic quality is maxed... then I get acceptable (but not great) pictures. The default setting straight out of the box is really poor quality. This camera is terrible at action shots. Even with the ISO adjustments. I am pretty disappointed.This camera struggles with low light and action shots. I get very few usable pix unless it has very bright light and a motionless subject. Good pix if both those conditions are met.It is a nice size and easy to intuit the menus. The LCD screen is large and clear. Using this camera is easy. The battery lasts and lasts. In fact, I have only charged it the one time when I got it. It feels solid and seems to be made well. Shutter lag is a bit slow, but still faster than my old camera.The seller (Beach Camera) was really, really  slow, but I am not factoring that into this review.So I guess I am in the market for another camera. One that is a bit better with capturing something other than still shots.Edited 12-2011 to add:I have still been unable to get decent motion or low light shots with this camera. Specifically, inside the school gymnasium (which is apparently a black hole, photographically speaking). However... I can use the same camera, in the same light and get decent video from it. I can actually record wrestling matches from up in the stands and have them turn out just fine.  This is a pocket-size video gizmo that works pretty darn well. I am very surprised since I fought trying to get pix with it for so long. Battery life is amazing, too. Just remember you can't zoom while shooting video so get all zoomed up first them just push the button and record the video.
