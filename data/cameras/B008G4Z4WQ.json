The user has many options or the camera can be used as \"point and shoot\".  I really do enjoy using it and looking forward to heavy use.  I have a Canon A-1 camera, a Sony do anything digital camera and now this Canon Power Shot that fits in a pocket and is always ready for that just one great shot.  I'd recommend it to anyone.", "Date": "January 12, 2013"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": "$299.99", "Features": null, "Name": "Canon PowerShot A4000 IS 16 Megapixel Compact Camera - Silver", "ImgURL": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/21Z6ZvzkqWL.jpg", "ProductID": "B008G4Z4WQ"}}
