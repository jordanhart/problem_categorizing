Haven't tried the video yet but I expect the same quality.  The size is perfect for carrying around all the time.  Battery life for the size is normal.  Pictures save to memory card really quickly compared to other cameras I've tried.  Great quality, ease of use, built in flash, great photo program included in package.  USB cord connects to the computer and downloads the pictures effortlessly.  I give this camera a full 5 star rating! Oh, and the price is excellent.", "Date": "March 2, 2011"}, {"Title": "Never have been able to get it to work right", "Author": "Denise Kuha", "ReviewID": "R3OJBUE8Y0KV1C", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "My mother bought this for herself two years ago. Neither she nor any of us, her adult children, have been able to get it to take a decent photo. It seems stuck on some weird zoom range and photos are always blurry. Based on other reviews I think the motherboards on a bunch of these must have been defective.  We have all tried every thing we know, every time we come visit her, by experimenting with all the settings, but nothing has worked. Now of course the warranty has expired. This is a terrible, terrible, terrible camera. It is a waste of money.", "Date": "October 8, 2011"}, {"Title": "Can't ask for more...", "Author": "DA", "ReviewID": "R3N9R735Z6AZK3", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "For the price, this is a great camera!

I have never seen one this bad...", "Author": "P. Breakfield IV \"Tom Steele\"", "ReviewID": "R2L15A7MPM6MOY", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "One of the positive reviewers says that they don't know why anyone would hate this camera... I find that funny because I can't understand how anyone could like this camera.First off, it takes terrible blurry picture. I am a photography enthusiast and take lots of different types of photos with my Canon 7D. I know my way around digital cameras. We also have a Canon Powershot S95 which is an excellent (but pricey) carry around camera.My daughter has a toy camera that adds sparkles, fairy wings, balloons and more to her pictures, but it is very low resolution and is a kid camera. She wanted a grow up camera.I figured at this price I would try the Vivitar X029.What a disaster. Defaults are at 3mp and it is set to fine quality instead of super fine. Why would they do that?Here are the deal,breakers though.1. the auto white balance is terrible. You end up with pictures that have a strange orange tint to them unless you shoot outside in bright sunlight only.2. The camera DEFAULTS to FLASH OFF. Not AUTO, but it turns the flash off.  So every time you turn on the camera, you have to go into the settings and change it to AUTO FLASH.Why would they do that? Why wouldn't they make AUTO use AUTO FLASH so that the camera would decide whether to use flash or not, based on the available lighting? It defies all logic...This is a terrible, terrible camera.", "Date": "May 5, 2013"}, {"Title": "Average Camera", "Author": "Johnny L.

Unless you have very good spacial awareness, or you just get lucky, all this camera is going to give you is blurry pictures. This is the only point and shoot I've ever seen without auto-focus. I thought I was crazy not being able to get it to work and then I actually called customer support and they told me \"No, this camera does not have that feature\". I've never heard of such a thing on a consumer point and shoot, especially one that cost as much as this. NOT worth the money. I just got it as a Christmas gift, and I'll be returning it as fast as I can. What a waste, but I'm not going to run around with my fingers crossed, hoping I'm the right distance from my subject that I'm going to get a clear shot.
