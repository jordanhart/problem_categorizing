{"Reviews": [{"Title": "High Quality Camera with Sub Par Bundle Pack", "Author": "Fluttrbye", "ReviewID": "R33CJQS3FXO9UR", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "My purchase of the Fujifilm FinePix HS30EXR 16MP Digital Camera with Accessory Bundle was  what I expected with the camera.When the box arrived, I opened it immediately since a corner of the box was bent inward, I was worried!  I found the 16GB memory card was missing from the boxed bundle pack of accessories that I had purchased.  So I called the supplier (Big Value, Inc.) and they shipped a replacement without any trouble.  I also let them know that the box that was delivered was smashed on one corner and that they needed to let the delivery department know that more protective stuffing needed to be put in their boxes before delivery. Then I went through everything in the bundle pack.1) This FujiFilm Finepix HS30EXR 16MP digital (bridge) camera with extended zoom is of very high quality. I have spent some time playing with it and becoming acquainted with some of the basic features, as I am not familiar with advanced digital features yet.  I found thru reading the digital manual from the supplied CD that this camera is very sensitive to lower and higher temperatures.  So if you are thinking of purchasing this camera, make certain you read the manual on the CD.  It is very helpful so that you don't harm this quality camera.  I still have much to learn about this very nice camera but I am VERY PLEASED with this digital camera purchase.  I think YOU will, also.2) The purchased 16 GB Memory Card and Bundle Pack:A:  The 16GB SDHC Memory Card:  Once the supplier sent me a new card, after the original one was not found in the delivered box, I tested it and found it to be of sufficient quality.  It gets FIVE STARS!B: The Full Size Photo and Video Tripod: IS OF VERY CHEAP PLASTIC AND NOT GOOD QUALITY- I give it a sub-standard ONE STAR!--This Tripod shouldn't even be in the bundle pack. Or the supplier should offer one made of composite materials or metal.  SUB-STANDARD-ONE STAR!C: The 3-pack 58mm Multi Coated Filter Kit (UV, Florescent, Polarizer):  These are of High Quality with a felt-lined case.  I am very impressed with them. They alone get Five Stars!D: The  USB SDHC Memory Card Reader: I haven't had to use it yet but it is an added feature for someone who might need it.  It appears to be of good quality.  Since it hasn't been tested yet, I give it FOUR STARS for appearance alone.E: The Padded Carrying Case w/Strap: This case with strap just barely fits the FujiFilm Finepix HS30EXR 16MP camera and not much else.  This case is TINY for a camera case.  A larger case should have been supplied.  But this little case and strap are of GOOD QUALITY and get FOUR STARS.  It would get FIVE stars had it been larger.F: The Memory Card Wallet:  Is small but sufficient.  It gets FOUR STARS.G: The Pack of LCD Screen Protectors : Are of GOOD QUALITY and more than enough to cover not just my FujiFilm Finepix 16 MP HS30EXR digital (bridge) camera but also other electronics I own!  They get FIVE STARS from me.  They are necessary.H: The  Lens/LCD Cleaning Kit:  Is of GOOD QUALITY and necessary.  It gets FIVE STARS. I:  The Mini Table Top Tripod: Is of GOOD QUALITY and gets FIVE STARS.", "Date": "December 12, 2012"}, {"Title": "nice in between", "Author": "Fairly Odd Mother \"Lori\"", "ReviewID": "R1SAHH80JF7H68", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I really like this bridge camera and have had a lot of fun with it since I bought it. Wasn't all that thrilled with the extras it came with, but I kind of knew what to expect so the price made up for that stuff. This is just my personal preference since I am partial to this brand. It has some quirks that Fuji products are known to have, but overall the photos are pretty darn good right off the camera. Like anything else, it takes time to learn the equipment. If you are willing to do that and give it a chance, I think you will be happy with your choice.", "Date": "February 6, 2013"}, {"Title": "Great camera", "Author": "AyaZ", "ReviewID": "R2IR8IXRF31J7H", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "No its not a dslr but it is the closest you can get without spending 1000s on all the annoying accessories.
