It takes wonderful, clear under water portraits and even videos. I also took some pictures outside of the water and I was impressed. It is such a nice camera to have and not have to worry about getting it wet. I highly recommend this camera for those who want a waterproof camera and do not want to spend much for it.", "Date": "June 21, 2010"}, {"Title": "Leaked after two uses", "Author": "beachfl", "ReviewID": "R1V04DMGL68OMA", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "The camera took decent pictures, but it leaked after only using it for the second time.

I picked this turd based on the fact that it is waterproof, 10mp, 3x Optical, has image stabilization, and only $49 at Wal-mart. Here is everything wrong with it:NOISEThis camera has the nosiest sensor I've ever used, and that includes bottom of the line Sanyo's. Laughably the camera gives the option of selecting up to 1600 ISO when 100 is barely acceptable for 4x6 prints. Don't expect to get anything larger out of this camera under any circumstances. This brings me to:IMAGE STABILIZATIONThis camera lists this as a feature on the box, what it really is doing is boosting the ISO in this mode so that the slow aperture lens has a fast enough shutter speed to eliminate camera shake. Never mind that ANY ISO over 100 produces an unacceptable amount of noise. Kudos to Olympus for giving me the choice of either a blurry picture or a speckled one.FLASHUsing a flash is not my preferred method of taking pictures, but this camera has especially poor results. There appears to be no compensation for distance and although there is a pre-flash I do not think the camera does any metering. The result is comparable to my LSI Diana, and that is not a compliment. Portraits are typically overexposed with dark backgrounds, or underexposed with blown out foregrounds.FOCUS/ZOOMSlow, slow, slow. SLOW.CONTINUOUS SHOOTINGYeah right. I checked with a watch, this camera takes 5 seconds, FIVE, to clear the buffer for the next shot. Then it helpfully displays the poor quality image you just took for an additional 2-3 seconds.MOVIE MODEI started to wonder if Olympus was just trolling consumers with this, 640x480 with massive grain. 1995 wants its webcam back.MY CONCLUSIONThe Kodak Playsport ZX3 this was purchased to compliment takes better pictures in every way. The Playsport is a cheap underwater camcorder. The problem is probably really the lens with this camera. The widest aperture available is 3.7, nearly a full stop slower than the Playsport's 2.8. Small format point and shoot digital cameras are handicapped in so many ways that a slow lens is basically a guarantee for poor image quality. If you need an underwater camera for a vacation buy a Kodak disposable over this.", "Date": "May 16, 2011"}, {"Title": "Decent camera for it's price.", "Author": "Fong", "ReviewID": "RUEPM2UGN7HDH", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "Pros:It does come with a micro-SD reader.Lightweight.Cheap.Small, Internal memory.Cons:The interface is a bit sluggish.The zoom is a bit slow.Buttons feel cheap, but I suppose thats because they're waterproof.Microphone, but NO speaker for in-camera playback.Screen is mediocre.Proprietary USB/video-out cord.Slightly slow recovery between pictures, but manageable.", "Date": "July 26, 2010"}, {"Title": "Great all around Camera", "Author": "George K. Dukes, III", "ReviewID": "RPDY0RY3A1GVU", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I like having a camera to carry in the car for those unexpected times where I want 'more' than a cell phone pic.  My last Olympus had served me well for many a year and finally quit working after 1,000's of pics.  I was able to get a deal on this one at the dreaded WalMart because a lower priced Olympus was out of stock.  I have thoroughly enjoyed the camera.  This is a great camera for shallow water usage, and I've taken great pics underwater and while I was in the pool.  It's great to be able to take the camera in with me, as I just put it in the pocket of my swim trunks.  I would recommend this camera to anyone!", "Date": "July 18, 2010"}, {"Title": "Great Waterproof/Underwater Camera!", "Author": "Dina A.

My last 3 being Olympus, which I've always had luck with...until I got this camera. I have always had cameras that I keep on the Auto flash/focus setting and get great pictures.
