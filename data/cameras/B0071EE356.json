Clark \"momdabomb\"", "ReviewID": "R2L03M7CIBKKMO", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Okay, here goes....I am a Kodak fan. The fact they are no longer making cameras didn't keep me from buying one. The pictures are clearer and sharper than the last one a c913. It automatically applies the Kodak perfect touch technology which is great so you don't get too many dark pictures. It takes too long to go into review mode to see your pictures but the lag time between shots is reasonable and it has a burst mode which is nice. This is a refurbished unit and is working just fine at the moment.........keep in mind it's only 1 week old at this juncture. I'm hoping it will last me at least 4 years as the other served me well until it was dropped. The pictures are good although they have a tendency to be hazy where they are not sharp but not too many blurry shots and I use it a lot. I got my fingers crossed for some years of great shots!I'm updating my previous review because I love this camera! It has functioned well and given some really great shots. It is still somewhat slow to preview pictures when you first use the preview after turning the camera on. The pictures are seldom blurry and it takes great low light pictures! I'm glad the perfect touch technology is automatically applied instead of me having to make the picture better after the shot! Still got fingers crossed! Camera is now 2 mos. old and used frequently.", "Date": "July 24, 2012"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": "$79.95", "Features": "Kodak EasyShare C1550 16 MP 5x Optical/5x Digital Zoom HD Camera General Features: Blue color\n16 megapixel resolution Capture beautiful HD pictures in 16:9 format\nView your pictures in high definition on an HDTV or other HD devices 1/2.3-inch CCD Face Detection\nLens: 27 135 mm (35 mm equiv.)
