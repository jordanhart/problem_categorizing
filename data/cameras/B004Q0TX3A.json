However, realize that it is just that. Don't expect it to perform on par with DSLR cameras. The optical zoom is extremely impressive. The multi-shot is a little slow. It will suck down batteries if used in the GPS mode so buy a backup battery if you plan on going crazy with it. Make sure you buy a class 10 SDCard if you plan on using the HD Camcorder function. Otherwise, good features and control (Manual settings), menu, flash, etc.", "Date": "March 19, 2012"}, {"Title": "Love it", "Author": "Charles Hughes", "ReviewID": "R17ZX5KCPP01BV", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Looked at every camera in price range before buying, I'm SUPER HAPPY, the pictures look fantastic!!!!!!!  It works in a few diffrent ways, it has a bunch of functions for people that know what they're doing, and then it has a automatic mode for beginners (THAT's ME!!!), I set it on automatic and take pictures and they look fantastic...

I have no issues with the camera itself. When we received the bundle I was a bit disappointed. The camera case is too small for the camera, and the two items that Amazon suggested as an add-on weren't the right products for my camera. Amazon suggested an additional battery and charger, so I took advantage as the savings were quite good. When they arrived, the battery is the wrong size for the camera so the battery charger was wrong too. The company that sold the battery charger was very nice when I informed them that there was a problem and they promptly credited by credit card and told me to not bother sending it back. The company who sold the battery didn't offer the same deal and I have to pay for shipping. Not sure I want to go through the hassle as the battery was $3.00.", "Date": "June 18, 2012"}, {"Title": "gadolph", "Author": "gado", "ReviewID": "RVP1RRT3CL7DS", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I am very pleased with this product grouping.

He needed a camera with a video feature for school. His film looked really good! He's also taken allot of pictures of flowers in our landscaping - close up photos. We may frame some of them. The picture clarity is amazing. The only down side was with video taping - it does not adjust to lighting changes quickly, so his moving had to stop and start when the scene went from inside to outside and vise versa.", "Date": "May 24, 2013"}, {"Title": "Happy so far", "Author": "GrampaGrouse", "ReviewID": "R2NJP8TJ6AN4ZE", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I needed to get a better camera for vacations, something small and from what I have read this camera is a good choice.

It was more than I wanted to spend on a point-and-shoot camera but after two vacations it has proven to be worth it.  The photos I have taken (close-ups of flower arraignments, landscapes/sunsets and groups of people) all came out very nice regardless of setting or lighting.  I'm no professional photographer and have no plans on publishing or blowing up these photos so they look fine to me.  The only major complaint I read on other reviews consistantly had to do with the location of the flash.  While I'll agree that it is placed in an inconvenient location (right below where your left index finger would rest on top of the camera) it is just that, an incovenience not a deal breaker.", "Date": "August 28, 2012"}, {"Title": "Manual", "Author": "Hermes", "ReviewID": "R31GPD08D3ATGD", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "The camera is good, but the manual is poor, is necessary more explanation for some points.

Has excellent zoom for getting close up pics from far away.  I use it all the time and it takes great game pics for just the average camera buff.  Great color and very easy to operate.  Would highly recommend this camera for anyone, since it is so easy to operate.  Takes excellent videos also.

Admitedly, my familiarity with Canon made the learning curve short.  The one thing I was looking for was a longer zoom.  It has really made a difference when taking a long range landscape shot; you can crop the picture before you take it.  I really don't use a lot of the sophisticated features that these cameras offer, but little by little I am getting educated.  So far, I am very happy with my purchase.", "Date": "September 27, 2013"}, {"Title": "Great camera", "Author": "sprashfl", "ReviewID": "R3IIVV2SBZ6ZTP", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I really like my new Canon powershot SX260.Pros: The zoom is just amazing; accessories are good; tried the video in full HD and its great; camera modes are good;Cons: Little heavy; felt the battery drained out fast when I used the video mode; didn't know how to use GPS;Overall its a great camera if I don't want to carry my SLR.

I've had it for about a year now and for a non professional photographer it works great.Some pros: automatic and fully manual settingsSeveral useful preset settings, the image stabilization for night time shooting works well I've been really impressed with this setting which gives you a sharp picture for night shots even without a tripodIt has a grid you can turn on and off so you can shoot straight pictures, that's usefulWhite balance settings work wellSmall and compactDurable, I dropped it (gasp) and it still works just fine the screen didn't crackEasy to use, intuitive menus and buttonsfairly wide angle for a point and shootCons:The color of bright colors aren't always true (floral pictures, sunsets)It no longer has the preset for a fast shutter (kids and pets)As you can see, overall, I am happy with this little camera.
