{"Reviews": [{"Title": "LOVE LOVE LOVE this camera!", "Author": "ComicFreak", "ReviewID": "R1W8N3Y4F8IGS3", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This bundle was a great buy, I highly recommend buying the camera bundled with the accessories as it is much cheaper.The camera itself is wonderful. I scrapbook and take tons of photos. I wanted a mid-level camera that would take decent action shots without breaking the bank, and this camera does just that. I take photos while riding my horses and if they aren't completely still while I take a photo, it's ok with the CyberShot. I don't have to be perfectly still while taking photos. If I zoom into the complete 20x zoom then it gets a little iffy, you have to be more steady when taking close up photos but it's still way better than relying on the camera on my cell phone. When you do zoom in, the photo quality is still good. I was surprised how good the photos still turned out with the zoom feature.I love how easy it is to change the settings on the camera depending on my needs. I can easily switch to landscape, outdoors, night time, or portrait settings with the flick of the knob on the top of the camera. I am an intermediate digital camera user so I wanted something that was easy to use and figure out quickly without having to read the user manual.Depending on the setting, there is not much of a delay between photo taking. I can snap several pics at once without missing valuable moments. The setting for evening photos has a several second delay, but it is understandable considering the conditions that have to be met for the camera to photograph properly (lighting, etc.).The camera display is easy to read. I also like the weight of the camera, it's not too light and not too heavy. It easily fits in a shirt or purse pocket. Overall this was an excellent buy for the quality of the item. I highly recommend it if you are not a professional who wants quality photos for scrapbooking, photo albums, or even certain sporting events. It is a great all around camera.", "Date": "June 18, 2013"}, {"Title": "Early Opinion - Excellent Camera", "Author": "Tom G", "ReviewID": "R3PFCCQTFULGUY", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "The SONY DSC-WX300 with the accessories proved to be an excellent choice right out of the box. I don\u2019t have lots of time on it yet but here are the points that support my review:1. The product arrived ahead of schedule without any signs of packaging damage.2. All parts were included in the shipping carton; everything was neatly packaged and well protected.3. The bundle pricing was a significant saver and it allowed me to purchase several components that I could not otherwise find on Amazon.com4. The viewing screen quality is crisp and taking pictures, selecting optional settings, zooming, etc. is intuitive and easy.5. The zoom function is responsive and the ability to shoot multiple pictures in rapid succession is a real plus over my vintage Sony camera.Things I can\u2019t comment on:1. I have not yet set up the wireless feature which would enable transfers to mobile devices and to allow my mobile device to act as a remote for self-portraits beyond arm\u2019s length.2. I did buy the extended warranty which cost another $48 but I justified that in part to the bundled savings and the high cost of replacing the camera should I have any covered issues. I say covered issues because the 4 year warranty does have a rather narrow scope, it defers to the manufacturer\u2019s warranty for the first year for normal factory defects but does take effect immediately for drops and spills. Note that the spills means it covers the camera if submerged in up to 6 inches of water so don\u2019t drop it in the pool.Final comments for comparison purposes:I spent about 5 hours reading and comparing professional and consumer reviews and since I was spending north of $325 (w/warranty) I was torn on which brand to buy but eventually selected the SONY DSC-WX300R. It was rated highest overall by more than one accredited reviewing team and its shortcomings were often shared across the competitors. The biggest drawback as per the reviews were a lack of GPS, too small a package size, and a slippery smooth exterior that made it hard to hold (easy to drop). I found all of these to be nit issues that I could live with. As for the reviews on Amazon by other buyers I read the good, the bad, and everything in between. Most of the negatives included missing or incorrect charging cables, early failures of the viewer screen and the fragility of the access door to the SD card slot and battery. The positive reviews were many for each negative and the extended warranty purchased should cover me if I encounter some of the issues that were raised. I feel good about the purchase and would recommend it for anyone that wants a true pocket camera with fantastic photo capabilities. Get the bundle with the external charger, a 32GB SD card, spare battery, protective case and the camera strap. The USB/SD adapter, the direct charging cord, the tripod, and the cleaning kit are all a bonus but not likely to be decision drivers.", "Date": "January 8, 2014"}, {"Title": "Pleased..
