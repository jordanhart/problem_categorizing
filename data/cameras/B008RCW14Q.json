Integrated wifi, and the ability to upload directly to Facebook, Picasa, Youtube (videos), and Photobucket make this camera a winner. There's even a built in panoramic photo mode a la Android 4.0+ camera (take one continuous panoramic shot). It even charges from a micro USB adapter that doubles as your pc connector. So anywhere you can connect a USB cord, you can charge the battery.This is a perfect upgrade for our point and shoot needs and I'm really glad we were able to purchase it on sale today at a local big box store.", "Date": "June 24, 2012"}, {"Title": "Great", "Author": "Abraham", "ReviewID": "R1QHX2S4484SCH", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Great camera, great connectivity, simply great! The quality of the photos and videos its amazing, a great purchase, so easy to use that you can do it with one hand. Great in every aspect.

There is no feature to automatically upload all new pics to the computerPower button sometimes doesnt react to first keypressModes have to be switched via on-screen menus, there is no rotary modes switch like on other camerasAll in all the drawbacks are mostly minor (except for low-light, but thats to be expected at this price level). I still give it 5 stars for compact size and overall pic quality.", "Date": "March 22, 2013"}, {"Title": "Love it!", "Author": "Shelley BR", "ReviewID": "R2PXOMNPQS41WE", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Love my new camera.  Pictures are clear, even when things are in motion.  Does not work quite as well in dim lighting.

With the apps I downloaded to Galaxy phone, I can use my phone as a remote viewer. The camera can easily talk to phone so I can send pictures via my cellphone. One thing I love is that it uses a standard micro usb charger so my cellphone charger works with camera.

This thing did a fine job of fulfilling my needs. The photos are crisp and the 10x zoom is nice. One thing I noticed is that it doesn't handle blue light very well. I was at a music festival and anytime the stage was washed in blue light it lost most of the details and caught mostly silhouettes. Also, if you're doing a video recording, and you go to zoom, while zooming the audio drops a bit but then is restored after the zoom is finished. Kind of odd, but not a terrible thing.Being compact, it was nice to be able to shove it in a pocket and not have to deal with a bulky camera hanging around my neck.I definitely want to get something better in the future so I can capture moments more perfectly, but this camera does everything you'd expect from it's features and does them well.", "Date": "March 3, 2014"}, {"Title": "FANTASTIC PURCHASE", "Author": "Cody Costantino", "ReviewID": "R3EEQC3GSS9H6A", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This camera was very worth the money spent.

Jung", "ReviewID": "R34NARW4OPECYD", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "I bought this camera as a Christmas gift.  It worked really well, once I had the appropriate MICRO MEMORY CHIP.... installed in January.  It survived my trip to the London and Amsterdam.  Unfortunately, it did not survive the trip from Amsterdam to London.  The display screen was cracked in my hand luggage (75 minute flight).....  My old digital Cannon camera survived the flights (I brought it because I was not sure if I would be able to figure out how to use the new Samsung camera...).I was able to pull the images off the camera via USB cord.  Thankfully!Samsung warranties the item and repaired it within a week of mailing it to them - I had it back within 10 days.It works as good as new - it was pretty much new - had physical possession of it for less than two months and took three (3!) test photos with it prior to the trip.The flash - light function is not as advanced as I expected (high-low light contrast).  Otherwise, it was a nice upgrade from my Cannon (purchased for $399 in 2007) - more megapixels and functions.  I tested the wireless function.  I was able to email photos from the camera BUT it took a while to type in the email addresses.  It is a fun new party-vacation camera.  The battery life is pretty good and there is a gauge - so I will know when it is running down.  My previous camera did not have a gauge and died in the middle of a trip.If you don't want to walk around with an iPad or a limited smartphone, this is a pretty good camera.", "Date": "May 2, 2013"}, {"Title": "Great camera", "Author": "Marsha M.

Since I purchased this to mostly take snowshoe pictures, it was of no use in bright sunlight as it was impossible to see subjects on the LED screen, which is the only way to compose pictures. The menu and selection buttons are very small, and can tend to give you incorrect selections unless you are very careful in pushing them. Additionally, every time you turn on the camera, by default it asks you to select between 5 settings for light, exposure, etc. Time consuming....it should just keep the one previously selected until you WANT to change it.
