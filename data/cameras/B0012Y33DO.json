Fleck", "ReviewID": "R4CASEXITITRQ", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "After 2 broken digital cameras (one Sony and one Nikon which broke only after 2 months of use), I can truly say this is my perfect camera.  It is portable, easy to use and takes probably the best pictures I have seen in this class of camera.It shoots readily without that long delay I have experienced with other cameras so you can truly capture the moment.  It also takes the most awesome action shots in the \"sport\" mode.  I went to an amusement park with my family and caught crystal clear pictures of my husband and daughter on the rides while they were in motion.  The \"anti-shake\" option is wonderful as well considering I am always chasing a 2 year old around for pictures.  This camera is very easy to use and at first seems like it might not have many options, but does.Overall, this is the best camera for the money and I can't say enough about it considering the plethora of problems I have had with my digital cameras in the past.", "Date": "May 23, 2008"}, {"Title": "Good Things Come In Small Packages!", "Author": "Amazon Customer \"music lover\"", "ReviewID": "R2YHESN8C0PJJH", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I recently purchased this camera to replace an older-than-dirt (at least in the world of technology) Sony Cybershot. It was the sleek design that attracted my eye, and the low price that kept it there! I first saw it at BJs for $140, and when I read the list of features, I thought it was too good to be true. I purchased it, and was amazed with the quality of pictures. I brought this camera on a trip to the White Mountains of NH last week, and was stunned by how many amazing shots I got. (Even my father, a long-time photographer, was amazed!)Pros:-sleek, small design-lens cover that slides open, rather than one that you may take off and lose (or one that mechanically opens, and may freeze up like my Cybershot)-high MP value for such a low price!-multiple shooting/quality modes-fine zoom-lithium-ion battery has long life (I'd say 10 hours, but I honestly haven't paid much attention to that- it hasn't been a problem for me.)-high-quality video - picture AND sound. Even looks/sounds good when hooked up to my television.Cons:-low internal memory-lithium-ion battery needs to be charged (can't simply be replaced on the go)Other than that, I can't really complain! If you're looking to find a high-quality point-and-click with a small design and a small price tag, this one's for you!", "Date": "September 1, 2008"}, {"Title": "Great camera!", "Author": "PAV \"PAV\"", "ReviewID": "R1NJX3P2PC3NW3", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This is a great camera. Just be sure that you set the image setting to 10mf, in order to get quality photographs. There were other reviews complaining about grainy photos. Mine were grainy at first, until I realized the Image Setting was set on 03m (suitable for e-mail). Once I changed my Image Setting to 10mf, then the photos were beautiful, with clarity and detail! Also, I bought a 2G memory card, so I can store a lot of photos! I love the small size of the camera, and the many features it has to offer. Fun colors, too!

So far, the only thing I don't like is that it doesn't have a sepia option.  Other than that, it's light, easy to use, and takes good pictures (not as great as I'd expect for a 10 MP camera, but good nonetheless). My first digital was a Fuji Finepix 1.3 MP and it was a great camera.  The quality of those pictures easily competed with 3 MP cameras when they came out.  My second was a Sony Cybershot - good camera, but this Finepix 10MP has better battery life and takes much better videos (with sound to my surprise).  The price on this could not be beat and I would definitely recommend it to the casual photographer.", "Date": "June 11, 2008"}, {"Title": "Amazing Little Camera!!!!", "Author": "S.

Isabella", "ReviewID": "RW379EYZ3S1ZA", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I bought this camera refurbished for $90. I had experience with its 7MP predecessor, so trusted that it would be quality.Photos are crisp and clear, even in low light conditions without flash. The manual setting allows you to play with all the photographic parameters, although a professional would hate to have to go through several menu options just to adjust the ISO setting. For anyone else, this won't be a problem.The menu is clear and easy to use. Switching the factory programed lighting settings (party, portrait, night, beach, snow, etc.) can be done very quickly. And shutter response time for action shots is very good. There is a delay though, when taking photos in low light with or without flash.Videos are mp4 format. The quality is what you would expect from a camera, comparable to a lot of what you see on youtube. It's adequate. I have no complaints, especially since it allows you to zoom while recording, which its 7MP predecessor did not.What I really love though, is the zoom abilities of this camera. There's a 3x optical zoom, but if you've selected the right menu option, the digital zoom kicks in once you've maxed out at 3x. I'm not sure how many x's the diital zoom adds, but I was able to zoom in on a jet plane flying at high altitude and get a clear photograph of it when to the naked eye, all you saw was a dot with a white streak trailing behind it....", "Date": "May 20, 2009"}, {"Title": "good camera", "Author": "T.

Stidd \"Stiddmaster\"", "ReviewID": "R2HXFYOL1X0LFC", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I like that you don't have to wait for the lens to adjust when you first turn it on or after you take a picture. When you turn it on it is automatically ready for a picture. I also like the way you turn it on. I bought mine just a week ago when we were in Washington DC. It worked perfectly for what I wanted. I wanted to be able to take a pic here, turn it off(to save battery) but have it ready to take a pic again as soon as I needed it. I could turn it off and on really quickly without looking. I also love all the features. I looked over many cameras like it, and found it to be the best for the price. It is packed with awesome features, on top of being a 10 megapixel which I wanted. It comes with its own battery and a charger. It doesn't use AA batteries, which some people might like or dislike. I liked it cause it doesn't take that long to charge, but it lasted the whole time I was taking pics, all the way until my card was full. Which AA batteries I am pretty sure wouldn't come close to. So you don't use as many which is cheaper, and you don't have to carry them around with you. The other plus to not having to use AA is it makes the camera able to be a lot more compact unlike most cameras. I love that you can get it in different colors, whatever your personality it. I like the different unique modes it has, that I haven't seen in other cameras, like snow, beach, landscape, sunset. So I would definitely recommend it.", "Date": "March 28, 2009"}, {"Title": "fiji fine pix", "Author": "C.

I will likely not keep this camera, b/c I think for it's basic functionality you could get one that is cheaper and likely better.  Drawbacks: There is no viewer, you only have the digital screen to use to see your shot.  Battery died extremely fast, took about 60-75 pictures max.

Arnold", "ReviewID": "RXNSM7URYQ14G", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I bought this camera because I recently went on a college trip to England, and one of the other girls on the trip had this camera. I like the way it worked in a range of settings. It worked everywhere from the dimly lit London pubs to flower gardens on bright sunny days. It was small and efficient. When I went looking for a new camera, I kept this one in mind. And as a college student on a budget, I must say I'm very pleased that I decided to buy it.This is a great value for a good, quality point and shoot camera. It has settings for a range of situations. I'm not a pro photographer by any means, but I recently used it to take my sister's senior portraits to try to save some money, and the pictures turned out beautifully. I shot the pictures outside and had to do some experimenting with all the different settings to get the best shots with the late afternoon light. The natural light and portrait settings helped capture the full range of colors on our outdoor backgrounds (lots of fall foliage). The face detection was definitely helpful, and the camera's 10mp gave us pictures that look great even blown up to an 8x10 size.The camera is small and sleek. Its buttons might be a little difficult for a person with not-so-nimble fingers. I love the way opening the shutter turns the camera on, but I can see how easy it would be to unknowingly turn the camera on and wear out the battery. It doesn't have a viewfinder, but I don't miss it with the big LCD screen. I definitely recommend getting a memory card to go with it simply for convenience.

It is really just average.  The photos are decent quality, but tend to be very grainy even in full light.  I'm not happy with the flash.  The LCD flash is too bright and white, imo.  The idea of a point and shoot is that you don't have to mess around with it too much when you want to take a picture, but with the flash being so bright it defeats the purpose.  The pictures look great if it is really bright or really dark.  Anything in between the flash will wash things out unless you play with the settings.The location of the lens is not a good thing, either.  I am constantly getting my thumb in front of it.The camera has some good qualities.  It's very small and light.  The color is cute.  10MP means it can take very large pictures.  The lens cover protects the lens and automatically turns the camera on, which is a very nice feature.  It is possible, with some messing around with settings, to get very nice pictures.
