{"Reviews": [{"Title": "I traded an EOS 7D for this!", "Author": "Coolkayaker \"ck1\"", "ReviewID": "R2P1Y9C296ONHO", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I'm a just a fellow who wants to take nature photos, and my kid at soccer and stuff for eBay and such.  I owned a Canon EOS 7D with fancy lenses, the whole works--about $3000 worth of Canon stuff.  all I needed was this camera.The EOS DSLR is heavy, \"fixy\", and not good for nature walks and plenty of mobility at sporting events.  Rarely would I use the 8 frames per second shooting rates.  I watched the DVDs on EOS 7D, and played with it and took some pretty artsy photos that I blew up and put in my office.  It's a great camera, the pricey EOS DSRL.  But it had plenty of drawbacks: price, size, bulk, complex attachments, battery life, compact flash rather than SDR cards, and on and on.But for what I need, this Canon here is stellar, and I sold all my EOS stuff, and extra lenses on eBay!!  I'm totally thrilled with the size, build, and photo quality of this camera.  Frankly, it's one of those situation where, to get the highest level of quality you have to pay exponentially more (the EOS 7D), with plenty of limitations (bulk, attachments, multiple lenses, etc.), when for most of us who just want to take quality photos, this is plenty enough.  I pop this into a Lowepro camera fannypack and I'm good to shoot and walk and hike all afternoon.  I adore the zoom, and as the reviewer below me states, when I zoom, of course there's less light entry into the camera and the images will be \"hazy\".  So, you must select a very bright subject at top zoom.  I can easily take my son on the bench across the entire field in soccer, and it's amazing.I wish the lens wouldn't move in and out whenever you turn the camera on, but rather just when you need zoom.  With every \"on\" cycle, the lens does it's silent grinding in and out like it's adjusting itself, even if I want to just taken a normal photo.  Battery drain, unnecessary mechanical movement, in my opinion.  I wish it'd do it only when I want zoom.Other than that, for me, the guy who might submit a photo to my local newspaper photo contest once in a blue moon, but mostly want to take excellent photos at the family barbecue, this camera is the best I have every owned.  And I've owned a lot (including SONY HRs, and Fuji hand helds, and on and on).  The movie capability, the size, the zoom, the battery life (very good), and the price (I paid more than this for one Sigma lens) makes this camera a winner.  I will mention that this particular camera is hard to find: I think Canon may know that it'll hurt the sales of some of the more pricey, entry level interchangeable lens DSLRs they sell because, spec for spec, they are very similar.

After having taken a few hundred pictures - including some side-by-side comparisons with the FZ35, here is my impression.The canon image processor is much better at color balance and overall image capture than the FZ35 - images are brighter and so capture more details otherwise lost in shadow or just a tendency the FZ35 has towards gray-scale processing in order to get the excellent sharpness the FZ35 is known for.Having said that - I would not recommend using the Auto setting on the Canon. Its choice of focal point within an image tends towards creating images where the background is just as likely to be more in focus than the subject. Typically the camera tries to focus around the edge of the subject rather than the subject itself. Sometimes this can work to improve clarity by improving depth of focus a bit, sometimes it creates an image where nothing is in focus and sometimes it causes the camera to focus on \"edgy\" subjects that may not really be the subject at all - like a lamp post in the background, tree trunks in the background, etc. In the playback mode you can select a display which shows you the cameras focal point - which can help explain why some of your images look they way they do in Auto.  Auto mode will also adjust the color of an entire image when it senses facial recognition to improve skin tones, but honestly the color balance of the Canon is so good anyway this is almost unnecessary and sometimes tends towards overcompensation so your entire image takes on a sickly green/brown hue.However, if you switch from auto to P - or in fact any other of the SCN or mode selections on the dial, these annoying Auto features are disabled and you can get some really great photos. At this point the camera uses a single center focus frame (the size and position of which can easily be manually adjusted to fit your subject if you like) and you start getting pictures more like you expect. In addition, the customization options of the Canon such as magnifying the focal frame, color options, easy adjustment of just about any shooting function, combined with the superb zoom range still make this camera best in class. My only complaint for SCN settings is I wish they had a \"sunset\" but that is easily created in the color menu where you can select to emphasize reds.The canon normally produces very clear images, however Canon generally processes to keep color balance as opposed to edge distinction at higher ISO speeds so sometimes the images become a bit more fuzzy than what those of us used the the FZ35 might like - on the other hand red stays red rather than turning black. You can manually limit the ISO to whatever maximum you prefer with the easy to use ISO button.If you want to add a lens filter protector, polarizer, etc. you will need to purchase the 67MM adapter to do so (Canon FA-DC67A) - and good luck finding one!This camera, like all of the others in this class, struggle with poor light conditions due to their small sensor. However unlike the competition, canon allows you to mount an external flash and that pretty much clears up this issue if you're willing to pay the expense. The way I look at it its a cheaper option than a $1,000-$3,000 DSLR which can go up to ISO 6,000 for low light conditions.Overall the Canon is definitely a step up from anything else that was out there - but it does have its quirks you need to be aware of and work around. The opportunity for creativity on one camera/lens is really unrivaled by anything else out there. The ability to go from 1 cm away macro to 35x superzoom at the pull of a switch just can't be found on any other camera, combined with the scene options such as fisheye not normally found on other such cameras, and wide range of color options also not found on the Canon competitors in this class, you have a great tool for creative photography. So while the SX30 is certainly not perfect and image quality will sometimes be less than your $3,000 DSLR+lens (although for some pictures you'd need large magnification/blow-up to tell the difference) - on the whole it's worth putting up with the limitations for the other factors. One caution - if you're looking for a simple to use point-and-shoot this may not be your best choice due to the often poor intelligence in Auto setting. If not for this it would have gotten 5 stars.", "Date": "October 19, 2010"}, {"Title": "The best superzoom digital camera so far.", "Author": "Joseph Ogiba \"jogiba21\"", "ReviewID": "R8M8YY3RFZF0F",

Well worth the wait!!!", "Author": "Josh Bieker \"BoxSetJunkie\"", "ReviewID": "R1TCZ946YB74TZ", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I scouted the camera's release back in September and have been waiting impatiently for it's arrival in early October! I finally got it last week and couldn't be more pleased! I've taken well over 2000 pics and at least 20 videos so far. Can't seem to put it down (literally- i've yet to use a tripod, even at 35 and 140x zooms)! I have shaky hands, so I was pleasantly surprised at the quality in any shooting situation!  The zoom seems to be the most reviewed feature, but this thing is far from done there! It has a million features from fully automated shooting to complete manual functionality! Tons of effects and modes (check Canon's site). I had looked at several DSLR cameras, and even tested a few out, and for beginner to intermediate usage this camera is gonna be tough to beat!  Especially with that price tag.  Here are some of the features that appealed to me: 14.1 MP, 35x wide angle zoom, 720p HD video, TV, AV , Manual mode (especially this- complete control of aperture, shutter, and focus), all the common photo effects, 4.5 stop Image Stabilization.  If you're looking for a professional quality camera, but aren't ready for DSLR pricing this is the camera to own!  You won't be disappointed!!UPDATE 10/26/10:I have taken well over 4000 pics now. Still loving the overall performance and quality. I don't own previous versions of this camera so I can't compare it to the other models.I sent about 50 shots in to be printed turned out amazing on 4x6 and 5x7. 8x10's to follow soon!Anybody interested in lens accessories, i found a link on another review for this site:[...]They have some great options for all three versions of this camera (as well as some other brands). I just ordered the 58mm filter adapter and the Hoya HMC Circular Polarizer (6 coats) 58mm. should be here this week. i'll update on those. should help a lot with my landscape shots!", "Date": "October 11, 2010"}, {"Title": "Super-Zoom Shootout: Canon SX30 IS vs. Olympus SP-590UZ", "Author": "David Siegfried", "ReviewID": "R1DHJD5WMYCUT2", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "This is a head-to-head comparison of the Canon SX30 IS and the Olympus SP-590UZ, which are both competitors in the super-zoom class of compact cameras. I will compare some of the features of these two cameras but mostly talk about the image quality between the two since I consider that the most important reason for choosing a camera.When the Olympus SP-590UZ came out in 2009 it had the longest zoom range of any compact camera with its 26x zoom equivalent to 26 - 676mm at f/3.5 - 5.0. Olympus has since come out with the SP-800UZ which has an even longer 30x zoom but is inferior in my opinion because it is strictly a point-and-shoot camera with no user control over aperture and shutter speed and no viewfinder.The Canon SX30 follows the SX20 and currently has the longest zoom range on the compact camera market, a 35x zoom equivalent to 24 - 840mm at f/2.7 - 5.8I took photos using both cameras of the same subjects using the same lighting and exposure settings. All photos were taken in aperture priority mode (Av). I have uploaded a number of comparison shots to the customer image section so you can follow along.At the far wide end of the range, both cameras performed about equally, that is to say, adequate but not extremely sharp. These cameras are aimed at birders and other telephoto enthusiasts, and so most of the test shots I took were at the long end of the range. Here the Canon was consistently sharper and was able to resolve finer detail, as in the photo of the evergreen tree tops, the milkweed seed strands, and the detail of the cement wall behind the light post. Both cameras quickly start to exhibit noise above ISO 100, but the Olympus was even showing some color noise at the lowest ISO setting of 64. By ISO 400 the shots are still usable but the noise in the Canon images is finer and better under control while Olympus photos are grainier. Noise reduction in Photoshop can clean up some of the noise with some possible compromise in sharpness.The one disappointment in the Canon SX30 is the macro mode. The focusing range is \"approximately 0 - 50 cm\" which sounds great but you literally have to get right on top of the object to fill the frame with the image. The Olympus has a dedicated Super Macro mode which allows you to take macro shots from further away from your subject. This not only allows you not to disturb your subject but also prevents the camera from casting a shadow on it. Macro shots with the Olympus are not only much easier to take but the results are better.Here's a direct comparison of some of the features of these two Super-Zoom cameras:Lens: Advantage Canon with a longer zoom and sharper focus. The Canon is faster at the wide end but both lenses are pretty slow in their telephoto ranges. Neither is great for capturing sports action or birds in flight. Neither camera is good for low light conditions without a flash either. Although the Canon lens is sharper it has some chromatic aberration.LCD screen: Canon has an articulating screen which means you can take shots from unusual angles and still see the screen. Olympus only has a fixed screen.Picture Modes: Canon has 10 color modes and one customizable mode, Olympus only has Normal and Vivid.Zoom markings: Canon lens has focal length markings on the lens, Olympus has none. Neither camera has a focal length readout on the screen, which would be nice.Lens Cap: The Canon lens cap can remain on while the camera is powered up. The Olympus lens cap has to be removed before powering on the camera, or else the protruding lens will push it off.Menus and buttons: I have no preference here, both cameras have good manual control and it's all about getting used to one or the other.Focus: The Olympus auto-focus seems to be more accurate at close distances. I saw some back focusing with the Canon at close range. Both cameras do a terrible job with manual focus, it is very hard to use. The Canon has a focus bracketing feature, something which I wanted to have for focus stacking, but I found out it only works in manual focus mode and it's slow. Advantage Olympus.Image Stabilization: The Canon seems to \"lock in\" while the Olympus seems to slowly drift. I prefer the \"locking\" image stabilization of the Canon even though it jumps around at times.Image Quality: This is where it counts and the Canon is the clear winner, particularly in the telephoto range. The images may need to be sharpened up in PhotoShop but the examples I posted were straight out of the camera. The Olympus would only be a better choice if you were going to be doing a lot of macro work.Conclusions:The Canon SX30 IS is the clear winner and appears to be the best super-zoom compact available at the moment. The optics may not be as good as a lens with a shorter focal range and there is some noise apparent even at low ISO values. Unfortunately camera makers insist on cramming more mega-pixels onto these tiny sensors which means more noise.  For these reasons and for the disappointing implementation of macro, Canon gets deducted one star.The image quality will never be as good as a DSLR or a Micro Four Thirds camera such as the Panasonic DMC-GH1 and I would not recommend this camera for professional or fine arts photography, but it would be a convenient and versatile choice under daylight conditions when you want to carry a minimum amount of equipment.", "Date": "November 20, 2010"}, {"Title": "Nothing but smoke and mirrors......", "Author": "freestyleFrEaK", "ReviewID": "R2CIMLPZLGAHB6", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "I purchased a new SX30is as a replacement and upgrade to my SX20is I had for 8 months.  The 24 mm wide angle and 35X optical zoom looked quite appealing to me however reading the fact the megapixels had been bumped up to 14.1 (from the 12.1 in the SX20is) on the same image sensor had me concerned about the picture quality this new Canon SX30is had to offer.  Pitting both cameras in the field (both indoors and outdoors) on various subjects both distant and nearby and set to equal settings on both cameras (in \"auto\" and in programmable mode with equal exposure compensation, ISO settings, lighting settings) I was surprised and disappointed in the performance of the new SX30is when compared to the SX20is.  The image quality from the SX20is consistently outperformed the SX30is.  Both in macro and pushed through the digital zoom spectrum.  The SX20is consistently produced better detail and color reproduction over the SX30is.  Yes, the SX30is did have a farther reach advantage over the SX20is ( theoretically 10X optical increase over the SX20is since the 35X optical zoom starts at a wide angle of 24 mm on the SX30is vs. the SX20is optical zoom of 20X starting at a wide angle of 28 mm) but what was puzzling was the fact I could take the digital zoom photos from the SX20is, crop and enlarge them slightly to match the SX30is zoom photos, and again, consistently have better image detail and color!  Again, this fact was prevelant even in the wide angle shots and macro shots!  However hard I tried under equal settings I couldn't manage to get a single shot from the SX30is to better anything the SX20is had to offer.  What a pity!  After 3 days of deliberation and countless photos, I decided the SX30is was not worth the money.  Frankly, no amount of additional zoom could compensate for poorer image quality.  Essentially what I was looking at in the SX30is was just a marketing ploy being pushed on the masses of unsuspecting casual phototakers who can simply be sold on a big zoom and so-called greater megapixels.  The SX30is was returned to where I purchased it from for a full refund and now I hold a greater appreciation for my SX20is.SX30is pros: large zoom, stylish DSLR style body, \"miniature\" setting, slightly larger LCD screen of 2.7\" vs. the 2.5\" in the SX20is (hardly noticeable), a slightly quieter lens extender motor (I couldn't tell the difference), a hotshoe for external flash, and a tether now comes on the lens cap (thank god!).  And really, that's about it.SX30is cons: greater megapixels crammed onto the same image sensor as it's predecessor, a cheapish feeling lightweight plastic body, poor image  quality, a switch to a proprietary battery as opposed to AA's (which you can get anywhere), the relocation of the SDHC card slot in the battery compartment on the bottom side of the camera, no raw file option, no threads to add lens filters, no lens hood cover ( was an included accessory with the SX20is),  a hotshoe cover that's almost impossible to take off without breaking, a higher retail sales price than it's predecessor, and finally, if I've mentioned it before then let me mention it again, POORER PICTURE QUALITY!What it boils down to it folks is Canon has given you a greater zoom and a \"greater\" megapixel designation all at the expense of poorer image quality.As Abraham Lincoln once said, \"You can fool some of the people all of the time, and all of the people some of the time, but you can not fool all of the people all of the time.\"Don't be fooled.", "Date": "October 19, 2010"}, {"Title": "It looks like a keeper...", "Author": "Vanamali Ashram \"Hari Aum\"", "ReviewID": "RJQLB047GLBWW", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I sold my Panasonic DMC-FZ18 to a birder in India last spring, thinking that I would simply order one of the next generation of ultra-zooms.

Sarver \"jzerot1437\"", "ReviewID": "R11TI5JK4W7RRU", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "About a year and a half ago I purchased the Canon SX10IS, but even before that I was an owner of the S3IS--in many ways the predecessor to the SX Superzoom line. The SX10IS produced some amazing shots of my trip to Italy, New York City's Halloween Parade, and just general scenery I shot in my spare time. Having been pleased with Canon's superzoom and realizing my SX10IS was nearing the end of its lifecycle (mostly thanks to some serious mishandling by a friend), I jumped on the SX30IS after its release this past October. Immediately after purchase I headed down to the park to test it out, and noticed the colors and overall picture quality to be \"off\". Everything looks extra drab with this camera, even with the vibrant setting switched on, and the the Manual mode seems particularly less responsive than previous iterations of the camera. Even worse, images look fuzzy and have a significantly limited focal point--while the SX10IS was capable of capturing images that looked entirely crisp and clear, this camera leaves you with only a small portion of the image focused. This is at least partially because Canon decided to up the superzoom to a whopping 14.1 MP, but DIDN'T UPGRADE THE LIGHT SENSOR. What you're essentially getting is a numbers game meant to leave ignorant users with a false belief that they're getting better images, when in reality they're getting larger, more poorly defined images. Bigger is not always better.Further--and I hope this is just my camera in particular--but the SX30IS responds horribly to sunlight. The viewfinder essentially \"blacks out\" at the weakest smattering of sunbeams, leaving you to blindly wonder what kind of photo you're getting.This camera isn't worth $420, and it certainly doesn't feature enough upgrades to justify the $120 price hike from the SX10IS MSRP. Sure there's a 35X zoom, and the Image Stabilization functions surprisingly well while fully extended, but who really needs a zoom that long aside from stalkers, bird watchers, and policemen on stake-out? Image Quality should always come first, and when my aging, obsolete version of this camera is taking better photos than this brand new, freshly manufactured model, it doesn't bode well for Canon's superzoom line. Roll back the zoom and focus on the Image Canon.Don't pay $420 for this. It's not worth it.", "Date": "November 3, 2010"}, {"Title": "Don't expect miracles with a small sensor", "Author": "4-Decade Amateur", "ReviewID": "R25N3RC4D16N0U", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I used a Nikon E8800 (8mp, 10x zoom) for 5 years as my primary digital P&S.; It was satisfactory in every way, although newer cameras with large LCD displays, longer zoom, faster shutter response and lots of additional electronic features did tempt me to switch. But the images produced by the 8800 were so consistent and noticeably better than what my buddies produced with a range of other P&S; cameras that the temptation to 'upgrade' was easy to suppress. Sadly a few months ago the 8800 became unusable because of Nikon's dreaded \"System Error\" which has defied repair; so a replacement became unavoidable.My style of photography demands a good zoom and I tried several cameras (Lumix FZ-28, Pentax X-90, Finepix S-1800, etc) and found the quality of images were well below the clarity of the 8800.  Basically it comes down to the size of the sensor, which is a much under-rated factor as all manufacturers and sellers try to convince us that the mega-pixel count is the ultimate metric for resolution - WRONG.  For instance the 8800 has a 8mp CCD 1/1.5\" sensor (which translates to an area of 0.58sq cm and a pixel density of approx 12mp/sqcm ).  All the cameras mentioned above use a sensor size 1/2.33\" (0.28 sq cm), ie less than half the size of the E8800 and, due to the increase in megapixel count, with a 400% increase in pixel density !  No wonder the images aren't as sharp, especially when enlarged to full size on a computer screen.  The Canon G-11 has a larger sensor but its optical zoom tops out at 5x, hence it did not appeal to me.The SX30IS also has the small 1/2.33\" sensor and, as expected, I noticed a lot of image noise even when the light conditions were good.  To overcome this problem I changed the ISO setting to 80 (instead of the default AUTO) and reduced the resolution to 7M.  This has improved the clarity of the pictures and reduced the unwanted image `noise' considerably. It is now my 'standard' setting.The SX30IS is a delight to use.  In particular the wide angle is really wide and the zoom is WOW!  The digital zoom does not produce unacceptable graininess in the image.  The in-built flash does a commendable job even at the fixed ISO 80 setting.  The camera has a comfortable size & balance and a good feel to it.  Being about 100 gms lighter than my E8800 makes it easier to carry around and, if necessary, to hold & operate with one hand. The articulated screen is very useful.  The auto-focus is fairly accurate though at large zoom settings the best focus is obtained on the 2nd or 3rd attempt.  It does take a bit of time getting used to the different menus and features, but that's to be expected where so many features are crammed into such a small package.The cons : I would suggest two improvements.  Firstly, the `Frame Assist' button needs to be relocated.  At present it is positioned exactly where the average user would place the thumb of the right hand.  Pressing this button is intended to cycle the zoom lens back to a wider angle; a very useful feature.  However, despite my conscious efforts to place my thumb in the groove meant for it, this button often gets pressed unintentionally.  At best it forces the user to miss the shot while the zoom gets back to the correct setting, but it certainly confuses users who can't figure out why the zoom sometimes operates without activation!  The second point of improvement is the need to have a self-activated pop-up flash.", "Date": "November 6, 2010"}, {"Title": "A great new addition to the Canon line", "Author": "Oscar Levant \"Bruce T\"", "ReviewID": "R24Z843R74WIA2", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Having owned a Canon SX5 and SX10, I am very familiar with this family.  My big decision was whether to jump to a DSLR: Rebel T2i or 60D.  I finally decided to stick with the group and go up to the SX30.  I realize the sensor is smaller and there is no RAW feature, but I don't have a lot of time to sit with images and tweak them in Photoshop.  Living on the beach, I wanted something that would pick out wildlife well, do a good job on the zoom and give me HD video if I wanted it.  The SX30 is a good choice for those and I'm glad I made the decision.PROS:1. They got rid of the four AA batteries and went to a proprietary lithium ion.  Great choice; it really makes this camera lighter than its previous models.  Get a second one on E-bay and use as a back up.2. The grip is a bit larger.  Makes it feel more sturdy in your hands.3. The zoom is just amazing.  Disengage the digital zoom (don't we all?) and use the 35X optical.  It's just great, though at the extremes, you need a good, solid tripod especially if you are using video.4. The 720 HD video works very well and you can zoom optically up to 35X.  Again, use a tripod or at least a monopod.CONS:1. No RAW mode.  If that's a deal breaker, move up to the Rebel category, but you'll spend four times as much money to get a zoom length of this size.2. No printed manual.  I always found useful the little 3x5 bound complete guide in previous models as it was was handy in the field.  No such luck here.  You have to print out your own from a supplied CD that has it as a .pdf file.  I was able to find a third party that sells something similar to what they used to provide, but when spending this kind of money, Canon should throw in a printed manual.All in all, this camera is a good investment and I highly recommend it.As always, Amazon sent this quickly and in good shape.RECENT UPDATE:  After some hands-on experience, my only additional comment would be \"get two more batteries.\"  The video mode eats battery life voraciously, so you need to have a few charged extras on hand.  They're cheap enough through Amazon.com.  Don't get caught with your power down.

I have taken about 500 pictures with the camera to date.  Compared to the Panasonic the image quality under most conditions is slightly improved.  Under low light conditions the Panasonic is noticeably superior.  Because the image stabilization works so well I can usually cap the ISO setting at 400 and still get blur free shots.  Under moderate to bright conditions I can hand hold the camera at full zoom (35x).  The viewfinder is very usable and I can adjust it so that I don't have to be wearing my glasses.  I find I use the view finder more than the LCD.  I haven't shot any video with it yet.  I love being able to adjust the ISO setting without having to navigate  through the menu.  In my estimation this is the best point-and-shoot available, and I'm extremely happy with the product.  I am using an eye-fi SD card which probably slows it done a little, but it's still acceptably fast for my needs.One minor quibble is that the lens isn't threaded, so that an adapter (at additional cost) is required to attach filters.  I like to have a filter on the lens for protection.  A lens hood is not included either.There are some excellent samples available in the dpreview.com Canon talk forum (including mine).

That camera is is not as good as my camera.!\"Each of the contending brands, be it Fuji, Nikon, Canon, Sony, Panasonic, and others, all have strengths and weaknesses.I see people feverishly wanting a certain brand, because they feel it holds the secret to great photos.They may like a certain brand, but upon reading a negative review, they figure the camera will not produce a sharp picture, or something else terribly wrong.Hey! Forget about that garbage!! There are no bad cameras in this group.

I wanted it badly!I read and watched video reviews of all the other brands, including the Canon SX30is. I figured the Canon was a \"flimsier\" model.Not a real contender. Wrong! I found out that \"dreamy\" Sony had it's faults too. Panasonics also. After research, I bought the Canon.The Canon SX30is has 35X zoom. What they don't advertise, is that after the 35X zoom, digital zoom continues to 140X!!!And this is not yesterday's \"cheesy\" digital zoom!People should know that 20X binoculars, (held with 2 hands) is almost unusable without a tripod.This 140X Canon magnification is hand holdable for photos.

You look in the viewfinder and he's very small indeed.Now you start zooming, and you start to see details about what he's wearing, and what he looks like.You zoom to about 3X the power of a pair of very good binoculars. 3X more powerful! You notice he has a tatoo on his shoulder.You zoom in full power 140X and clearly see the tatoo fill most of the photo. You snap the picture. It turns out great.Think about this. 35 X zoom is equivalent to a slr less of 840mm.99% (I'm guessing) of DSLR owners will never own anything above 400mm. Most perhaps a 28-250mm zoom.Many professional photographer don't own, and have never looked through an 800mm long lens.A professional 800mmm Canon lens costs retail.....$20,600.00! Hey, but Amazon sell's em' for $12,499.00. Go for it!That's just 35X lens. It does not zoom.  This Canon SX30is goes to 140X! In video also! The video quality is truly excellent!The other brands that have a very strong zoom, in all probability, don't have the image stabilization Canon owns.But honestly, technologie continues! The \"WOW!\" digital cameras of yesterday, don't hold a candle to the \"WOW\" cameras of today in some respects.Wait and see what next years model will bring, or buy now, and have fun now!Oh, by the way, if you're a photographer, the Canon does all of the manual settings,(even flash strength), and the image quality for this format is excellent.Just \"google\"  photos taken from the Canon sx30is, and see for yourself what serious photographers are producing with this camera! (Be sure to select \"Images\" first!)I actually believe I would be able to take totally awesome photos with all the \"contending\" brands, in this catagory.Any knowledgable photographer should be able to capitalize on each camera's strengths, and tweek their weaknesses, right?So, If you want a lightweight camera, that has the ability to capture excellent photos, and you like to adjust things, besides having full automatic features,And if you want to enter a world of high magnification zoom, (a place many photographers have not experienced up til now), this is a solid choice!If you are thinking of buying a DSLR, and then purchasing a high powered 10 pound lens that you carry around in a suitcase, and usable only with a 10 pound tripod, keep dreaming free baby!

The video is easy to use and zooms with all the same super power you get for still photos.

Frankly, all of the negative reviews that I was seeing made me nervous, so I ended up buying it at a local store in case I decided to return it -- the local store even matched the price.I am a semi-pro photographer.  After two months of use and thousands of photos taken, everything from macro-photos of pollen on flowers, to birds in flight, and even a wedding, it also did an excellent job with 4th of July Fireworks.  I have to say that this is a fantastic camera for the money.  No, the lens is not an L Quality Lens, Yes, this lens, like all super-zoom lenses, is highly susceptible to lens flare -- but some of the flare results turned out really great as ~effect~ shots.  The Chromatic Aberration is NOT a problem -- people have really exaggerated that, even high priced L lenses have Chromatic Aberration; IMHO I find the level of CA to be acceptable.There is also nothing wrong with the color rendering of this camera.  Digital Photography is a system that consists of the camera, the computer's Display screen, and the Printer.  Each one of those three components has an affect on the perceived color, even the brand of printer paper that you use can affect the color.  Despite what some other reviewers have said, I find this camera's auto-white-balance color rendition to be excellent.  It's auto-exposure is also quite good.The Image Stabilization is astonishingly good, and ISO 800 is tolerable with ISO 400 being very usable.  The Zoom Range is incredible, not even a high priced pro-camera can match it -- as a single walk-about lens, this one gets the job done.My advice would be that you should buy a lens hood, read the manual, and get lots of practice.  The secret to taking photos of moving objects like birds is to switch the camera to Servo Focus Mode.I have come to the conclusion that most of those negative reviews are more of a reflection on the lack of skill of the reviewer.  If you are a casual snapshot shooter you will probably be frustrated with this camera and not like it.  But if you are willing to spend some time learning how to use it and you don't have thousands of dollars to spend for a pro camera then I think that you will love this camera.For those people who complain that this camera can't be used for action shots because it's not 8 frames per second...  Well, hey, if you have got $3-$4 thousand dollars to spend then by all means go get yourself an SD7 camera with lenses and knock yourself out.  But if you don't have the money to spend then you ought to learn that taking action shots is mostly about the skill of the photographer.  For instance I've met a world famous wildlife photographer who for years used a FM2 (Fully Manual 2) camera -- no motor drive, no auto-focus, etc. The reason being that when out in the field for months at a time he didn't feel he could rely on batteries.  But having now taken shots of Birds In Flight, I can tell you that it takes practice but this camera can deliver the goods -- no, it won't get the shot every single time, no a professional sports photographer would not be happy with this camera, but it gets the shot a lot more often than my previous camera did.  There is no shutter lag if you know what you are doing, but yes it does take over a second to save the picture so you have to choose exactly the right moment to take the shot, you only get one chance -- that's where skill and practice come in.  But guess what the same is true for all cameras in this price range.I agree with others that Fully Auto Mode should be avoided it does make some very silly ISO choices -- use P Mode instead.  I also do find myself getting frustrated at times with the auto-focus, either not getting a lock or locking on the wrong thing.  However the Face Detection Focus works surprisingly well.Macro photography is a little bit difficult.  On the one hand it takes amazing photos -- I never realized plants had so much hair on them -- this is the most powerful macro lens I've ever owned, I've photographed things that I had never seen before, it's like having a microscope.  On the other hand I can't get a close focus, generally I have to stand about 7 feet away, most of the time this distance is awkward, it's very hard to hold the camera still, but sometimes it is actually useful to be further away from the subject. I plan to buy a set of 67mm close-up lenses which will solve the problem and give me the best of both worlds, the ability to be far away or close as needed.  This lens is also pretty amazing as a telescope, the shots of the moon are fun.The tilt and swivel screen is also a valuable feature which even the pro-SD7 lacks.I have not used the video mode much, but was surprised at how good the on-camera audio was.  Most cameras in this category have unusable on-camera audio because they pick-up all sorts of camera noise.  But in casual video testing I found this audio to be well above average, the voices were very clear.Bottom line, this is a versatile all-around camera with an amazing lens, and at an great price.  If you are serious about photography -- at least enough to be willing to read the manual, this is a great camera and an incredible value.  But if you just want snapshots of your kids and are not willing to learn how to use the camera, then you will probably be frustrated by it's many advanced controls, finicky auto-focus, and poor Fully Auto Mode.", "Date": "August 16, 2011"}, {"Title": "Great Camera", "Author": "pmarlow", "ReviewID": "RPMKHBSTHB4TO", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Prior to purchase of this camera, I read many of the reviews within Amazon.

Williams Photography\"", "ReviewID": "R2E4E0Z2W7D1WX", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Alright, so I purchased the Canon SX30 IS and was expecting nothing more than an advanced Point and Shoot digital camera with a well known name. I've shot with Point and shoot camera's since they first hit the shelves. My last Point and shoot was a FujiFilm S1800 (great camera by the way, had it for about 3 years or more).I own a Nikon D7000 DSLR and love it (or used to). I've actually considered selling it now!I got this camera on the 13th of Oct. 2011 for a good stack of money. Talk on the net was that it was a bridge camera DSLR/Point and Shoot. I had to see this thing in real life action, so, I bought it.Reviews on the web i.e. youtube.com and other sites alike, made me almost not want to buy it. But, I did anyway.Here's what I've got to say about it.I \"am\" going to be replacing my D7000 with this Canon SX30 IS. Why?This camera is capable of shooting the same if not beyond the D7000 capability's without a doubt. I paid more than 1200.00 for my 300mm max zoom lens for my D7000 and am getting 500+ more power from a 350.00 point and shoot for 1. The clarity is amazing if you use the manual focus for all of your photographs and it's pretty simple to figure out. The best part about this camera is that you don't remove the lens and have to worry about dust or anything getting into the components and having to clean the camera about every time you turn around.The camera has full manual mode which allows you to set your ISO, Exposure, f/stop, and focus manually to your specs.Some reviews said it did poorly in low light, ha, okay, sure it did. I took a 30sec. Night shot of a water fall and believe me or not, It's beautiful, sharp, and very well lit with detail.Having the hot shoe is a major plus for me. Without it, I'd be lost with all of the portraits I take (which by the way, are amazing.)I've been a professional photographer for 6years young and having this camera saves me so much time and effort with the same and even higher quality photographs as the D7000.It does have it's flaws just like any other camera out there. But, does anyone complain when it's a DSLR that has flaws? No! So why complain about a bridge camera with the same types of flaws?I have a friend on a forum who shoots with a Canon Mark 5, he's been complaining about it since he got it about the same issue. (the manual focus don't work like the other's he's used to). It's an electronic what do you expect? Superb quality? Not me, I know the rules of electronics and that is that of each and every one on the shelf of the same exact product will be different in one way or the other, no electronic is made exactly the same. It's impossible.On with the camera! I have used every single setting on the camera just since I got it. I went to the local lake to shoot some wild life, portraits, and water sports along with waters capes and landscapes down to macro and back up to high above the atmosphere (moon). I didn't come up short in any hand with any of my photographs. Each and every one of them was sharp and in focus with the right exposure each and every time. 840mm is a distance and shooting completely hand held, with this quality, this camera should have been put in the market as a DSLR fixed lens.The biggest mistake most people make is (they don't read the manual). This is the most important thing to do before you even turn any new camera on. The manual will teach you how to take some really good photographs to start off and once you've got them down pat, then you can start advancing to more of your style photographs.I won't even get started on the software enhancements area it's just to much to deal with.Bottom line! It's affordable for almost anyone, It sits in your hand just right, it's also light compared to a DSLR, it takes crisp shots from the start, but most of all, it's a CANON. I used to be a Nikon fan, not anymore! This camera is amazing in all aspects.TIP: the camera is 14MP and has a sensor that isn't set for that high of a resolution. Go into the menu and down the resolution to med. This is where your crisp shots will come from. Med. is 7MP but well worth it. Besides, why take photographs so huge you can make a good sized billboard out of them? I normally don't shoot past 5MP do to the size and all of the re-sizing for prints I'd have to do, just saves more time and gets your work done that much faster.Good luck and happy shopping, oh, and if you do get this camera, happy shooting!", "Date": "October 13, 2011"}, {"Title": "Outstanding pictures - Very competitive price!", "Author": "Sir William Williams III \"Have Camera, Will T...", "ReviewID": "R38XLTBUDGKZVA", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This camera takes outstanding pictures.

Almost all of them have been made by Canon.  My main battle camera at the moment is a Canon 7D, a solidly built, well designed camera  There are times however, when I wish to go some place without having to carry my additional lenses.  Until last month, I would take just my Canon G-11, a feature-rich\"point and shoot\" camera.  The camera has one of Canon's new generation of the Digic 4 processor, which yields images of superb clarity, saturation, and sharpness.  Canon's annual model introduction has brought forth the Canon G-12,  After reading the reviews of the G-12, I felt that the new features were not significantly different enough from the G-11 to warrant a change.I was in the market for a small camera with a long maximum focal length, I was thinking about a Panasonic Lumix model many of which feature superb optics and good zoom ratios.  Then Canon introduced the SX30IS  which I think of as a platform for an image stabilized telephoto zoom lens. A photographer can hand-hold the SX30IS at its longest focal length and still get sharp images. It is even better when used on a tripod.  My main motivation for purchasing the SX30IS was to be able to get better photographs of birds.  The camera arrived early one evening, a beautiful clear night with the Hunter's moon about 10 degrees above the tree line. I tried to use the camera's viewfinder to compose the photos of the moon, but even when starting at 24mm and then trying to zoom in on the point of interest I found it difficult. However, when I deployed the 2.7 inch LCD articulated display, I found it much easier to locate and then zoom in on the subject.  The built-in light meter was excellent. I took a reading and then underexposed by two f-stops. The photographs were sharp and detailed.The form factor is better than the G series because it is easier to hold without accidentally changing buttons that set functions. However, one still should use caution.  I have taken some photos of birds with the SX30IS and find that the range of f-stop and shutter speed can be limiting at times.  The plastic pop-off cover that protects the flash mount is less than optimal. I think it is there more for looks than for function. I cannot think of other Canon's with such an ill-conceived cover (They provide a small pouch with velcro closure that fits on the camera strap for your convenience!).Apparently obtaining accessories for the SX30IS is proving to be difficult for the time being. I have been waiting weeks to get the special adapter to fit a lens shade and 67mm skylight filter to this camera. Canon seems to have given this third priority and so far very few are available for sale, even from the big NY camera superstores. This camera is not for everyone, athough it offers great value for the dollar.  For those looking for a a full-function light-weight point-and-shoot, if you do not already have the G-11, consider the new Canon G-12 for an additional $50 if you do not need the 840mm focal length of the SX30IS.", "Date": "November 14, 2010"}, {"Title": "The Best Camera for Taking Photos from 512-yards away.", "Author": "Michael J.

And since I hand-off my photos to others in the field, I need to print my photos on a portable printer with no opportunity for computer software enhancements. For budgetary and practical purposes, the camera also needs to be light in weight, inexpensive and simple to use.While hunting for the best camera meeting my above criteria, I compared the Canon SX10IS, Fujifilm HS10, Nikon P100, Panasonic FZ100 and Canon SX30IS compact zoom lens cameras. I compared these cameras by taking photos of students from 512 and 514-yards. I measured the distance with a Bushnell Yardage Pro. I received the best IQ of the students from my SX10IS set at 20x zoom + 4x digital zoom and mounted with a 1.7x TCON teleconversion lens. I mounted the TCON-17 to the SX10's and SX30's 52mm lens filter threads using a 52mm to 55mm step up ring. Someone pointed out to me that these are not actually filter threads, but concentric circles, but they accept my step up ring very nicely.Although I found that the SX30IS gives me better IQ than the HS10, P100 and FZ100 at distances over 500-yards, the IQ of the SX10IS with a TCON-17 teleconverter attached is still slightly better than the SX30IS at these extreme ranges. Too bad the TCON-17 does not work well on the SX30IS.I give both the SX10IS and SX30IS 5-stars when compared to the HS10, P100 and FZ100 which just don't work for me at extreme ranges.With today's technology, we can't expect any one camera to be everything to everyone, so if you need a camera to take a closeup photo of a war painted tribal chief eating roasted grasshoppers off a banana leaf under triple canopy in low light for a national magazine, then you probably should be packing a Nikon D3X or Canon Mark IV together with your new Canon SX30IS or older SX10IS mounted with a TCON-17.", "Date": "October 8, 2010"}, {"Title": "This is a great camera!", "Author": "krycom", "ReviewID": "R2NT4ONKVPM4ZA", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I see a lot of complaints about this camera and it's quality of photos.

We've had compact ones that my wife likes and I've several of the 'S' and 'SX' models.We did our dream vacation this summer - Alaska cruise and land tour.  Purchased an SX20IS and got some great pics.  Part way through the vacation I broke the latch on the battery door and finished the trip with it taped closed.  When I saw that Canon had a new model with a 35X zoom I decided to sell the broken one and buy the SX30.  Glad I did.  This is by far the best of the Canon's I have owned.  Things I like -1.  I wear glasses & always dial in the focus on the viewfinder.  On all of the old models I would have to re-adjust after the camera was handled.  Canon added a ratchet 'clicker' on this model to lock in the adjustment.  Small improvement, but handy.2.  The button to zoom out when trying to follow a subject at extreme magnification is a wonderful feature.  Have only had the camera for a couple weeks but I think it will be great.  Example - On the Alaska vacation it was a big challenge to try and follow moving wildlife like killer whales with the SX20.  Wish I had this camera on the trip.3.  One of the SX30 reviewers commented about poor resolution with this model compared with the SX20.  I did not find that to be the case.  All of the pics I saw from this other person were taken past the optical zoom and at the extreme digital zoom.  Personally, I never use digital zoom because I know the images lose quality.  The chickadee I posted for this camera was taken about 75 feet from our deck & was hand-held.  I cropped the image slightly.  Think it looks good.  Nature photography has been one of the greatest thrills of the extreme zooms on these cameras.4.  Location of controls.  Quite a few years ago I lost the tip on my right index finger in an industrial mishap.  My grip on the camera is a little different because of this.  On the SX20 I found myself bumping the manual focus control frequently.  The SX30 moved this control to a different `clock position' on the rear control.  Have not had any problems bumping the manual focus at all.5.  Battery stuff.  I had several sets of Rayovac Hybrid AA batteries for the SX20 & loved them.  Great shelf life and lots of power.  Was not sure how I would like going to a proprietary battery on the SX30.  The battery on the SX30 appears to be a monster.  The battery life indicator in the viewfinder is a terrific feature too.  I shot 45 minutes of HD video at a grandkids Christmas show and played it back into the PC to burn a DVD.  The battery indicator never moved off full.  When I first got the SX30 I thought about buying a spare battery.  Now I'm not sure if I will ever need it.  I mentioned that I broke the battery door on the SX20.  The SX20 door seemed kind of flimsy, which is unusual for Canon products.  I think the battery door on the SX30 is more `robust' & doubt I will ever have a problem.5.  The control wheel on the top of the SX30 has more heavy duty grooves than on previous models.  Would be nice if shooting in the cold with gloves on.All in all, I think Canon really has a winner in this new model.  I'm an active amateur, not a pro.  I'm not sure what benefits RAW format has.  It is missing on this model too.  I'll let some other reviewer comment on RAW format images.  I may add comments as I use the camera more.Notes added 12/29/10 - I still think this is an awesome camera.  I've seen comments comparing this camera to Nikon DSLR's and the fact that it doesn't have the features or accessories that a Nikon D50 has.  Duh, this isn't an $1800 DSLR, it's a $369 (as of 12/2010) high end point and shoot.  You cannot compare this camera with a DSLR.  It you want all of those other features and accessories, go out and spend another $1500.  For what this camera is and what it costs, it does a tremendous job.  It gives you awesome zoom capabilities, a nice size screen, wonderful results when used on auto and programming features that allows you to customize your shooting session if you like to do that.  All this is in a compact size with a lot of easy to access controls.  I have found from owning several of these type Canons (SX20IS, S2IS and S5IS), I often leave the camera on 'P' as I like to set 'film' speed lower to get better images.  One thing I changed on the camera was the strap.  Although the factory strap is decent, it is shorter than I like.  I spent $20 of a Tamrak N45 strap.  It is longer than the factory unit, looks tough as nails and is comfortable and non-slip on your shoulder.One thing I noticed taking flash pics during the holidays - I got better results using the 'P' mode with the flash turned on and ISO set to 200.  This forced the shutter speed to 1/60 where the auto mode may have used a slower shutter.**************", "Date": "December 20, 2010"}, {"Title": "GREAT CAMERA!!! GREAT PRICE FOR FEATURES!!!

I was expecting a great product from Canon but was surprised at the professional quality of the pictures. Really good for new users; great for those experienced with digital cameras. Reason for the \"really good\" vs \"great\" in previous statement is that it has a lot of advanced features, and there is a bit of a learning curve getting used to them all. Recommend going to the Canon site or owners disk and downloading the 100+pg owners manual (this will save a lot of time in learning the camera). This camera is a great compromise between a point-and-shoot and an SLR (14.1mp quality pictures with ridiculous optical (and digital) zoom. The 35x optical is like having a 24mm-840mm SLR lens and optical takes it out to 3000+mm though the quality begins to suffer as is expected with digital zoom. I would be hard pressed to justify a $500-$1500 SLR base + an additional $500-$1500 for a set of lenses to get the same zoom quality unless it was my profession. I could not be more pleased with this camera, Canon did not hold anything back on this one, and did not disappoint on quality either! I highly recommend this camera to anyone who has always wanted an SLR (like myself) but could not justify the SLR price tag.

I was impressed with its small size/weight for such a zoom.  I liked the fact that it zooms very fast, has a VERY IMPRESSIVE IMAGE STABILIZATION, creates superb photos for its class.  This will open doors for me to shoot animals - imagine taking a shot of a snake's head without being attacked by it.  Or a crocodile.  Or a bear.  Imagine shooting insects and not having to crop 80% of the photo.  Some people may want to shoot action sports with it.  Some people may want to buy this camera to take pictures of small children without disturbing them.I liked the display that can move, but would prefer a larger size.  I liked the HDR aperture and focusing capability.  I liked the hot shoe.  I liked the 720 video capability.  Also, let's not forget about the price:  in the SLR world just a lens with this magnification and without the camera would be $9,000.00 to $12,000.00.  That is 30 times the price of this camera!!!  And you can't hold those monsters without the $1000 tripods.  I understand the picture quality difference and the low-light capability, but still...Things I would prefer are 10 megapixel sensors instead of 14 megapixels.  Standard thread for filters.  In fact I don't know if one CAN put a filter on this lens.  If you know of any, please let me know.  The lens in this camera has almost no aperture options at large zooms, which is sad.  I prefer AA batteries in a camera, but Li-IONs is how camera manufacturers make money these days...I wold like to see a camera with the Canon G-series-type sensor and this camera's zoom for better image quality, low light shooting and higher ISO, even if it means larger size.  In my opinion, ISO is a useless feature in the standard sensor-size point-and-shoot cameras.  I always set it to the lowest value, otherwise the picture becomes grainy.Overall, this camera is unique and very impressive.  I highly recommend it to sports action photographers, animal world photographers, and even the architecture photographers.  Don't leave it at home if you go on Safari!Update:Lensmate sells adapters for 58mm lenses and filters.  They also sell accessories specifically for this camera from other manufacturers, so you don't have to figure out what they are.

If you need micro-adjustments, the way to go is Manfrotto Junior Gear Head for $250 which apparently is the least expensive.  No full zoom moon photos for me...", "Date": "October 25, 2010"}, {"Title": "Slow Camera", "Author": "Mighty Biffer", "ReviewID": "RPQWKE1IO97SQ", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I really wanted to love this camera but I ended up hating it. The camera looks cool and the heft feels good when holding it.  The features sound great and seemed to have great potential but many of them just turned out to be extraneous bells and whistles.  The swing and pivot LCD is a great idea.  It allows for great photo angles and protects the screen when off.  However, it is only 2.7 inches and noticeably smaller than most other similar camera 3\" views and the screen quality is not as good as the competition.  The zoom works as it should and picture quality is more than necessary.  The pictures a clean, sharp and vibrant.  At this point the camera seems like I should like if not love it but there are some big problems with it.First some lesser problems:  The flash is overpowering and makes every picture look like high noon.  There is no simple/quick way to get a little bit of fill light. While the guide/manual is thorough it is digital.  This would be great if I only took photos by my computer and not outside or at a ball park.Now the big reasons as to why I am returning this camera. I bought this camera to take pictures at baseball games and of wildlife.  In both settings the focus of the picture is moving and shots happen at the spur of the moment.  To take pictures of a outfield catch or bird in stretching its wings, you need to have the shutter respond almost the instant you decide to push the button.  The Canon takes at least 1 second to do all of its internal checks before it actually records the image.  Sometimes I noticed that it took over TWO seconds to take the shot.  This meant that whatever I was trying to get a picture of had already happened and the central figure had moved on.  Trying to anticipate when to take the picture is nearly impossible as the lag between pushing the button and the shutter snapping changes.Now I could almost accept that flaw but when taking pictures the second good shot almost happens right after the first shot.  The Canon is not great with this.  Once the a picture has been taken it seems like forever before the camera is ready for the next shot.  It really doesn't take forever just 6-7 seconds.  It was long enough that we actually timed it to see how long it was.  The specs on the camera say that faster memory cards can shorten the delay between shots, but the 6-7 seconds was obtained when we were using the memory card that had the fasted write that was supported by the camera.But the final straw was the lack of any true burst mode.  Burst mode allows me to get the super shot I want b taking multiple pictures a second so that one of them is the one I want instead of guessing at the timing of when to hit the button.  The canon can be set to take pictures continually but this only takes lower quality pictures at about one second intervals.  What truly amazes me is how no one at Canon nor at the store I bought this from could understand how taking 20 frames at 8 fps would capture live action better than 2 pictures a second apart.All in all, I would only recommend this to someone that was taking posed or still life pictures.  If trying to take candid or real time pictures this camera would not work.", "Date": "August 6, 2011"}, {"Title": "Very surprised by negative reviews...", "Author": "RalphK", "ReviewID": "RR26ZS3N3QSKI", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "After 30+ years of owning goood, but not great, 35mm SLR's, I finally decided to take the plunge into the world of digital cameras. A local retailer was offering a Canon Digital Rebel + 18-55 and 55-250 lenses for @$650. Couldn't resist right? Except I did. Like many others, I just didn't feel like lugging around a camera body plus 3 lenses (I would have added a Macro lens). I had read mostly positive reviews of the SX30IS but the few negative reviews made me a bit wary.... were images far inferior to DSLR's? I am not Ansel Adams but I like taking good pictures.  I am surprised I was not stopped by store security in the camera isle as I walked back and forth between the SX30IS and the Rebel bundle, unable to make a decision - convenience vs image quality? Well, I opted for convenience and I am now sure I made the right choice!. I got home around 7:30 pm with just enough light (and just enough understanding of the functions) to shoot about 30 pictures - trees, birds, license plates; anything to get an idea of what the SX30IS was capable of. All but the extreme zoom shots (which I would never have attempted to hand hold anyway) were tack sharp. I just cannot understand what problems others are having that warrant 1,2, or 3 star reviews mostly with complaints of \"blurry images\"?. I can think of only two answers:1 - defective product2 - (I apologize for this suggestion) that people are simply not taking the time to understnd the various modes/ functions and expect point & shoot simplicity with DSLR results.I spent the rest of the evening shooting flash shots and transferring images to my computer and, in short, I am completely thrilled with this camera. It may not give you DSLR like images (though damn close) but neither will it require DSLR like baggage. 2 enthusiastic thumbs up.", "Date": "June 24, 2011"}, {"Title": "Is the SX 30IS a good \"Mom\" camera?", "Author": "P. Probst", "ReviewID": "R2H6IH3MLYDB7L", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "Canon's recently released PowerShot SX30is is a bit of enigma.  I bought this camera even though I had reservations based on a number of user reviews here on Amazon. It has a 35x image stabilized, optical zoom that translates in 35mm terms to 24 mm - 840 mm (unheard of range for a P&S;!).  It also has digital zoom that doubles or triples the 840 mm (but we never use the digital zoom feature on any digital camera or camcorder).  Unlike the bulkier Rebel DSLR, the SX30is is small and light and extremely well balanced. In addition to the awesome zoom range, I felt size and weight were important features for my family since they have only used compact and sub-compact P&S; cameras. The camera is fairly comfortable in my hands when held either vertically or horizontally.  It shoots 720P video in addition to stills but I haven't tried the video yet.It sounds like the perfect camera but it does have flaws.  Most notably for me is the time and effort it can take to accurately focus on your intended subject.  It's very likely you'll miss those quick grab shots of junior doing something cute while the lens is hunting for the proper focus.  Sometimes the focus is spot on while other times it is off by a hair or worse, totally out of focus. This should not be too surprising considering the extensive range it has to go through to get to the proper focus, but it is still frustrating.  Focus occurs when you half press the shutter button so when not properly focused you'll have to release the half-pressed shutter button and repeat the process until the focus is acceptable.  At times this can happen on the next press or after the 3rd, 4th, or 5th press.  When you half press the shutter, you never know where the focus will end up so it's kind of a craps shoot. This could be a reasonable 'Mom' camera if Mom has lots of patience! Otherwise, the auto focusing might be a deal breaker. NOTE:  I am not a Mom but I've heard my wife's complaints about her current P&S; long enough to have a fair idea about what's important to her camera-wise.I am very pleased with how well it handles colors.  All my shots so far were taken on Auto. Reds, greens and blues are vibrant and accurate in bright sunlight and also when using the flash.  The built-in flash is the best I've used on any of our point & shoot digitals.  It did not wash out the subject when the shot was taken from close range and always produced pleasing color including flesh tones with no bright spots.  It also has a hot shoe so you can use a dedicated Canon speedlite flash.  The 24 mm wide angle offers lots of flexibility.  I've been able to capture our entire family room while standing just a step or 2 beyond the room. That's pretty amazing when you consider its optical range maxes out at 840 mm.  NOTE: Tele shots will benefit with use of a tripod or monopod!I must say that I am very unhappy about the lack of a hard copy of the complete users guide. Although there is a hard copy of an abbreviated start-up guide, Canon did see fit to include a hard copy of the 190+ page users guide.  The full users guide is only provided electronically on CD but quite shockingly to me, it cannot be copied or saved to your hard drive w/o Canon's permission, as it is password protected.  You can print it is but who really wants to tote around 200 - 8x10 pages when a compact users manual provided by the manufacturer is all you should be carrying around with you.  Canon, this total BS! Canon needs to immediately address this nonsense because it really makes no sense at all for the user not to have a portable, physical users guide, which has been included with every Canon camera I've purchased until this one.I've rated the PowerShot SX30IS 3 stars because of the obvious shortcomings including my finding that some of the plastic parts feel cheap and fragile, especially the mode selector next to the shutter button.  There's also been a lot of discussion here on Amazon about 14 MP on the small chip and what it means for image sharpness but I choose to overlook this aspect for this review. Once I've had the opportunity to more completely familiarize myself with its full capabilities and shortcomings, I may come back and revise my assessment.Although Canon's flaws and oversights on what had the potential to be an exceptional P&S; camera disappoints me, I do feel it was a good purchase primarily because of the flexibility provided by the enormous zoom range and pleasing color rendition.12/22/10:  The SX30IS got returned before Thanksgiving after less than 2 weeks use.  We replaced it with the Rebel T1i dSLR and are really much happier with this camera than the SX30IS.  Weight-wise, the Rebel is more comfortable to use than the SX30IS.  Autofocus on the Rebel is lightning fast, very accurate, and much less frustrating than any P&S; camera, particularly the SX30IS. There is zero shutter lag and the results so far, both snapshots and enlargements, look great. The T1i was on sale for only $250 more than what I paid for the SX30IS.  Although it cost more, I think we will be saving $$$ in the long run considering that we have 'upgraded' our P&S; cameras annually to the tune of $250-400/each. To that point, I used the same SLR, a Canon F1, for many years and still have it. My wife loves the T1i and does not miss the SX30IS one bit. In case you're wondering why the T1i over the T2i, it was because we had no interest in the new video features on the T2i (which is essentially the only meaningful difference between the T2i and T1i, while everything else is more or less Canon 'hype') and so we opted for the equally highly regarded but less expensive T1i.", "Date": "November 12, 2010"}, {"Title": "Amazing Camera!", "Author": "dewey", "ReviewID": "R2LY65BBKFOBI4", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This is truly an amazing camera and a bargain for the money.

Before making my decision I read many many reviews of each camera on the Amazon site and elsewhere. I studied photos taken with the candidates posted here and on Flickr. I visited stores like Best Buy, HH Gregg and others for some hands on looks. Tired of looking and confused by the choices, I finally bought the Canon SX 30, a camera near the top of my list of choices. I was swayed by that promising 35x zoom, the impressive miniature mode movies and stills I'd seen, the 14.1 mega pixels, and mostly by the irresistible $318 Black Friday special price.  Considering what I paid for the Canon, I'm not terribly disappointed. Had I paid closer to its initial $400 + price, I'm sure I wouldn't have been happy with the decision.Details regarding features and specifications are available here and on any good camera site. I'll restrict this review instead to my experience with the Canon SX30is and my impressions after two months and many shutter snaps. The Canon s my fourth mega zoom or bridge camera; it replaced a Panasonic Lumix DMC with an 18x zoom.ERGONOMICS AND CONTROLS  This camera has a learning curve, and I continue to learn as I use the camera. It's not a light camera, mostly requiring two hands to hold it steady especially when fully zoomed. I like that the flash flips up manually though I sometimes forget to lift it. That mega zoom really projects so be careful when taking a picture through a window or taking a close-up shot. I don't find the controls intuitive. Some settings require using the menu button, some the function button, some the display button , and some the four options around the function button. It's easy for a newbee to miss a shot while figuring out what to do. Example: Press the function button to delete one picture. Press the menu button to delete all of the photos. Of course, each button press is followed by others.For 11 dollars from Adorama (on Amazon)one can buy a cheat sheet that summarizes how to access all of the camera's functions. How many cameras need one of these?ZOOM -  The zoom, I suppose, is as advertised though many of the impressive sample shots I saw prepurchase were taken with the digital zoom. Maybe it's zoom greed, but the 35x isn't as impressive as I thought it would be. The 140x fully zoomed in digital is impressive but the clarity of the shots at that length lack clarity as expected. At that length I have much better success using a tripod or some other form of support. To demonstrate my zoom greed, I  purchased a cheap 2.2x teledapter even though Canon advises against it. The heavy accessory screwed on to the adapter fine but the pictures with it were terrible.PICTURE QUALITY -  For me it can be uneven. Many of my keepers have to be tweaked with a photo program. Occasionally I'll end up with a Wow quality picture, even a few rare ones right out of the box. I have least success using the auto mode and better success using the specific settings, especially the P mode. The vivid mode is wonderful and portrait is good. Face detection has been fine for me. In the Scene modes, I like low light, super vivid, snow, color accent and fish-eye effect. I've had lots of fun with the fish-eye effect and taken some very funny pictures with it. Color swap is fun and can produce some awesome results, but for me it's tricky to set up the colors to swap. Color accent can produce some terrific results.ACCESSORIES - Since the camera lens isn't threaded I bought Canon's lens adapter for adding filters. I keep a UV filter on all the time instead of using the lens cap and also have a circular polarizer and the aforementioned 2.2x tele conversion lens. The polarizer works fine but is unnecessary since the vivid setting produces deep blue skies by itself. The camera also has a setting to specifically emphasize specific colors, including blue.Last random thoughts of a Potato HeadThis is my fourth bridge or mega zoom camera. I'm always upgrading to get more zoom or mega pixels. My best camera was a Sony DSC H1 camera with 12x lens three cameras ago that with a dedicated Sony teleconverter almost matched the zoom of this Canon and took better pictures.In auto mode the focus can be fickle and I've missed some good shots because of it.Can't force flash in auto mode, but since I don't use it often....I really like the feature that lets you zoom out and then in again with the press of a button when you've lost your target. Great feature.The articulated LCD screen is no big deal for me. I seldom use the feature and would gladly trade it for a 3\" screen. Doesn't seem possible that .3 inches could make such a difference. Quality of picture on the LCD screen is fine, not outstanding.Face detection works well and battery life is good. If charged ahead of time, the battery should through a day of serious picture taking.Colors are mostly accurate. With tweaking of settings using the P setting, I can get good pictures of my two white dogs. Getting good pictures of white animals can be difficult.Haven't used it often, but movie mode is more than acceptable and the dedicated movie button is very convenient. I'm disappointed with the miniature mode films I'm taking but still working on it.The photos that impressed me most are those of a red tailed hawk that was in a large, shadowy cage. Using the low light setting and 35x zoom I got some decent pictures. Somehow the bars of the cage in the foreground disappeared in the pictures that almost look like those of an uncaged bird. Look for them in the posted pictures.Finally - For the same price, I might buy this camera again. The Canon SX30is has so many features that one who can remember how to use all the controls, has a good eye, and is creative can have lots of fun with this camera. Just want a simple point and shoot?  Keep looking.Addendumb 8/12/11 - Ever looking for better photo results, I sold this camera and bought an SLR. Yes, I'm getting pictures that are a little sharper, but I really miss the Canon's zoom and especially the fun of that fish eye option.

Instead, after testing photos (both on auto and manual), I couldn't get a single photo to impress me unless it was shot in macro! Noise on most images was inexcusably noticeable, regardless of the ISO (or other) settings I tried. When there wasn't a lot of noise, there was instead so much chromatic aberration in lighter environments that I just couldn't stand it. Overall sharpness on any image taken was poor (except for macro once again). This was still the same even when changing the picture resolution from 14mp to 7mp (one megapixel less than the camera I was trying to replace).I had held off buying the SX20 at first (which, in general, had nice reviews) for literally months because I was thinking they'd have a good successor. At first, from specs, it sure looked like it. The zoom really is great (not to mention convenient). The features and settings are easy to use and very customizable. Yet, for ~$400, the image quality was such a letdown (even for a point and shoot camera) that it wasn't worth the cost to me. The camera I had been using from a few years back (also a Canon) took much sharper photos (manual or auto). This is what prompted me to return the SX30 as soon as possible. That bothered me too much.After doing so, I looked into some alternatives and decided on Nikon's P100 model. Reviews looked promising, and overall it had some nice specs too, so I thought I might as well try it out. After testing its settings on dozens of pictures, I've decided I should have bought this from the start. Chromatic aberration is nearly non-existent (which is perhaps the biggest improvement over the SX30). Noise only gets really noticeable at higher ISO's (which isn't surprising). It shoots 1080p instead of 720p video (which is sweet). Pictures come out quite nice on auto (and, it too has very good features that are customizable). Very nice overall, and it's light. One thing I should mention though is that, by default, the P100 had the image quality set to \"Normal\", rather than \"Fine\".

It is a worthy successor to my old Canon PowerShot SD880 IS Digital ELPH. I have my share of PROS and CONS for the camera in my arsenal of photography equipment.CONS:One of the few problems with the camera is its speed. You try to get a picture of your friends playing basketball or soccer, you'll likely end up with a blurry image and/or not catching your friend scoring at the last second on time. Unlike my Canon EOS Digital Rebel XT which is faster in taking snapshots despite it's an old Canon model, the Canon SX30 isn't that great in action. You need to have patience to take an action shot with it. My suggestion is to take a video of the action if you still have trouble with the action snapshots.Be careful how you use the long-range zoom. Sure, it is sweet of Canon to give this camera this zoom but you may have to deal with it going out of focus. The best range I used without losing focus was at over 200 mm. Plus, the red color may come out all pixelated at your selected long range. If you want to get a better shot ranging at a distance with focus, get a tripod.If you're a fan of taking self-portraits using a mirror while in a low-light room, your picture may come out grainy. Even with the manual flash engaged, you may get the same results. Try increasing the exposure to increase lighting in your picture.A little issue is having to get used to setting the manual flash on. Yes, you need to open the flash on your own. It doesn't open automatically unlike most other cameras. Plus, everytime you take a picture in a low-light location, there's a small chance you will get an indicator on your camera to use the flash. Press the flash button to make it do a flash.Customizing your schemes on 'C1' and 'C2' is a pain. Unlike my older Canon that does allow to keep the custom changes, this camera doesn't seem to keep them. Everytime you turn it off and swtich it back on later, the two customade sections reset every time. I have yet to find a solution to that frustrating issue.Lastly, the camera is somewhat bulky and its size is almost equal to a regular DSLR camera. One time I got a camera bag made by Lowepro, I was unable to fit my camera in. A different camera bag I got for it is a Targus. Find a good size bag from them or another company before making your purchase.PROS:The HD video at 720 delivers good quality visual recordings. Go ahead and make a video of it as long as you want. What's also good is that your recordings won't catch any un-wanted background noise whenever you put your fingers on the zoom or stop the recordings. My old Canon SD880 had a problem getting that noise everytime I record; but, not this camera!One of the features I like the most is the swivel screen. You can either switch the screen to the back or front. There's also moving the screen to face you for a better self-portrait or with a friend. On older cameras, you have to try a number of times if the picture came out right or not. And, it's better not to have the swivel screen open more often. Keep the screen facing the camera and closed everytime you're done.Do you perfer taking pictures using the old method? This camera can do that! Just press the 'DISP' twice to switch from the screen to the viewfinder. It's a little slow in the viewfinder but you want it at that setting, then go for it.Even uploading your media from the camera to your computer is fast enough. You need to have a USB camera connector, by the way.Conclusion:That's about it; and, there is a lot more to learn about the Canon SX30. Think of good strategies for your camera and be creative of your photography. Enjoy and keep it in good shape!", "Date": "October 20, 2011"}, {"Title": "As Good As it Gets", "Author": "Robert L. Reynolds \"Bob Reynolds\"", "ReviewID": "R1D4BB4U9JRE1P", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "This 4 star review should probably be a 4.5 star.  After 5 years good experience with Canon S3 IS, this camera is a vast upgrade.  I would recommend buying this model if you are just a hobby photographer such as myself since it is probably as good as it gets for a point and shoot camera.THE GOOD:  35x optical zoom and 140x with digital....I'm in heaven!  Great quality lens in any event.  2.7 inch LCD is adequate considering that it swivels for a big plus.  Would have liked a 3 inch or larger.  Retaining the optical viewer is great.  Image stabilization is much improved to the point where taking a handheld picture at 140x outdoors is no real challenge.  Using 140x in low light indoors is possible but takes a little effort.  Zoom assist button is real nice addition.  All the face recognition software and features is another plus, but, will probably not be used by me.  General layout of buttons, wheels, and knobs, and menus is probably about as good as it gets for this complicated camera and makes holding the camera more comfortable than old S3.  I even like the smaller, lighter battery that lasts longer than 4 AAs and I was able to buy a spare for less cost than 4 rechargeable AAs.  The location of memory card in same compartment with battery is a \"don't care\".  The video is good. If I wanted perfect video I would get a camcorder.  The ease of taking video, jumping into manual mode, setting ISO, and going automatically into macro if needed are all nice features.LESS GOOD:  Several of the negative reviews I have seen could be handled by reading the 196 page user guide which is part of the furnished CD.  No printed copy is furnished, but who, besides me, would actually read it anyhow?  I printed 98 pages of the best material to supplement my 5 years experience with very similar S3.  I have never skimmed the guide or picked up this new camera without learning something new.  I am getting better and better results with each day since this camera takes some work to get maximum results.  The external lens interface has what looks like internal threads but is actually just ridges to retain the lens cap.  The external part has some sort of flange where an adapter can be attached for filter use. Why not just accept filters directly?PERSONAL OBSERVATIONS:  The picture quality is not just automatically great.  Proper settings help a lot, but may require a little study in the 196 page guide. Outdoors at 140x a great deal depends on the subject.  If focused on area that has nearer and further away material then focus is confused and the picture is fuzzy. An object at set distance comes out good. You can use manual focus, but it takes some effort.  Indoors it is difficult to focus using 140x in low light, and once done, it is almost essential to use the flash for faster shutter speed and crisp picture.  Upon suggestion of another reviewer I am using the P mode shooting and setting the ISO to limit at 400.

The \"pros\" I've listed sound like a bunch of ad copy, buteach point was a surprise to discover, and a good one, for sure.Pros:Battery life is excellent, even with lots of playback, off/on cycles and zooming.The wide range of settings in \"menu\" allows appropriate control under every conceivable condition.The convenience of having separate buttons for stills and video makes going between the two modes instant and very handy.The 35X zoom reaches out and gets the image, whether still or video, every time. The focus locks on and stays on, even in low light.Under rough conditions, the swing out viewing screen nests facing inward, so with the lens cap on, the camera is really well protected from dirt or damage during transport.Two easily programmed custom setups allow for individual shooting situations and are conveniently activated with a twist of the top knob.The menu and wheel control are not only easy to get at, but they also make sense. Going where  you need to go and making the adjustment you want is quick and convenient.The manual settings are also easy to use, as you can toggle between f stop and shutter speed with one button push. Getting a sunrise or sunset to darken down for max chroma is fast and accurate.The stabilization system is surprisingly effective. Blur from camera movement is infrequent and minimal, only really an issue in very low light where no camera would do much better.The image stabilization is even more amazing in video mode- you might think the camera is on a tripod with a fluid head, but it's just a well designed IS, that's it, plain and simple.Cons: Opening the flash requires flipping it up by the front, not pushing a well-placed button.Manual focus is a bit unhandy. Over and undershooting with the control is an issue. When appropriate, let the auto focus do its job. It will.The eye level viewfinder is a bit lacking in detail. It's difficult to see good sharp focus because of the lack of detail in the finder, but autofocus is so accurately, I trust it and have rarely been disappointed.The camera is small, so if you have really big hands and fingers, you might have trouble at first with some of the controls which are close together.The ubiquitous Canon wheel control requires a bit of learning, as it can easily be pushed in by accident while trying to turn it, but this issue goes away with very little practice.Wind noise in the dual mics is a problem, even with the low frequency filter turned on, but none of the consumer cameras would probably do any better.You shouldn't expect it, but the lack of a mic input jack is also something you'd think they'd include but don't, same with most others.Overall opinion: I really believe anyone who purchases this camera will find it a constant and valuable companion that, with a little care, will give years of satisfaction.", "Date": "July 12, 2011"}, {"Title": "Great camera, tad pricy", "Author": "J.

I quickly dropped 60D due to its weight. When you add a large zoom lens comparable to 30IS, it becomes very heavy. I left this for professional photographers. Then I liked T3i. Bought one and experimented with it. Takes great pictures. But hard to take any decent video. Then, I scaled down to T3, primary due to price. Still great pictures, but cannot see taking video with it.The SX30IS became the winner, not just due to the price, but the functionality.1) Great pictures at very good light. Quality is not distinguishable from the SLR's when viewed using a large screen TV.2) Great video. You can zoom. It does auto focus. The SLR cannot do that, you will need  a tripod to stabilize the picture. You have to zoom manually by turning the lens. I decided that these SLR cameras are just for taking great pictures and would need to have an additional video camera. 30IS does both for me.3) SX30IS has a nice dial pad to view pictures on TV. This is a very handy feature missing the SLR cameras4) Swivel LCD display is extremely handy during some occasions, especially for taking video at a party. The pricier T3i has that feature.5) Great zoom. Can take a nice closeup picture of my kids playing soccer. Amazing pictures of animals from distant without disturbing them.  For SLRs, you probably need to carry 2 lenses and keep switching b/n the 2, which is extremely awkward at moments you want to take pictures. Took amazing pictures and video of firework on July 4th with SX30IS..On the down side, bad pictures at low light levels at far distance. The SLRs bit it hands down. However, at those situations, red-eyes happen to be a problem, making the pictures difficult to use. Those red eyes are difficult to remove or mitigate without extensive editing.SX30IS Camera works great at close distance even at low light levels. However, you need to use custom setting, not auto setting or the night portrait setting. I ended up defining a night setting (ISO 400 work great) and saved it as one of the camera modes (C1 or C2). This is another great feature.Since the only problem is far-distance low light levels,  I returned all the SLRs and now keeping the SX30IS. Just the perfect one for my family. If it fails to get a good picture when my sons perform at a stage, I will sure be disappointed. Fore everything else, it ill be a great one.The perfect camera would be this with a large sensor.

Just sold my SX20is at eBay and looking for another camera now. I must say the Canon SX1is has better picture than SX20is. But both are not better than my cheap Samsung Digimax i6. However, I paid for what I get. The i6 has weak flash and small zoom. The SX20is has long zoom and good flash. It depends on what you want to do with your camera and how much you can afford. With the custom mode on SX20is, I can get good picture that almost match my i6 camera.Many people complaint about picture quality on SX20is or SX30is. I wonder how Canon can sell their high end models if they make these feature rich zoom monster with same picture quality.I know your answer.So I believe Canon purposely put a lower quality sensor into these mid-range camera and the selling points are the other features, like long zoom, auto mode, etc, etc.So if you can afford $1000 or high, go for the high end camera and you get the best pictures and the feature that you need. A 840mm zoom lens can cost a lot of money !!!If you want a camera with long zoom but can't spend the money, then get this lower end camera.If you just want a nice picture, I believe many lower end camera can take better picture than SX20is or SX30is.When you show any picture in a 7\" LCD picture display, most picture from most cameras look nice on it (as long as you don't do side by side comparison from other camera). This is why most picture posted at Amazon site here are nice because Amazon reduced the big picture to small size so you don't see those \"defect\". But if you need to print large photo (or zoom in your computer screen to 2x or 3x the size) and still want to be very nice on it, then you should buy the high end camera. It is as simple as that.For me, I find it more \"fun\" to have a long zoom camera with a low budget and as long as I stay with \"custom\" mode, the picture is OK. My son plays soccer so I need a LONG zoom range to catch him in the field :-)I also tried the Fujifilm HS10 with 30x zoom. Its picture is actually better than SX20is (with some adjustment) !! It is not the best, but better. I also like its manual zoom lens. However, it is just a little too big for me to carry. Also manual zoom lens make it harder to take smooth video with many zoom. But HS10 has the color adjustment for each major color, so you can get the real color for your picture. It is in the same price range as SX20is and SX30is too.Most compact super zoom cameras do not have hot shoes. But HS10 and these Canon SX cameras are two of them with hot shoes.

My wife loves the camera and we consider the best camera SHE has ever owned (I use DSLR's mostly).  I do find myself using this camera when I don't want to lug around heavy equipment.  It also comes with a decent flash (lit up my whole living room in the dark, nobody believes I took it in the dark) and I can use my professional flash using the hot-shoe for even better flash options!  This camera has exceeded my expectations exponentially!  Another great feature, I can use my 52mm filters!  I have a UV haze on there for better pictures and for protection and I mount the other filters on top of that one...I can't go out as wide if I use the circular polarizer but otherwise, it's a great feature to have on a so-called point-and-shoot...me and my family are very satisfied and recommend this to anyone who is not looking to invest heavily on a DSLR but want to get that kind of quality...", "Date": "July 7, 2011"}, {"Title": "Quinn", "Author": "quinn", "ReviewID": "R3PFGO6R58IC2H", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I have never had a camera of this quality before!!

But the fact this thing does both very well is a huge bonus, not to mention the zoom!!! I took pics of the moon and you can see all the creators, sooo cool.

The powerful 35x optical zoom is especially useful for concerts, shows and performances. It provides unlimited fun for observing the skies and shooting wildlife too. It would cost a lot more if you were to buy a DSLR and the lens required to do this kind of zoom.Picture and video quality are fantastic. The stabilizer works very well even if you zoom all the way to 140x (with 4x digital zoom that comes with the camera). The auto focus should be good enough for normal shots. But using the manual settings will give you surprisingly great quality results for your pictures and special shots. Use it together with a filter adapter and some lens, it will make you feel like a pro!Of course, you can't compare this to a pro DSLR which also cost many times more than this.

So, I will give my take on Canon SX30IS from this perspective.I am updating it after using this for a recent trip and after taking couple of hundred photos and few dozen videos.I never wrote this long review. I want to help everyone who is contemplating between DSLR and point and shoot. Also, help decide between comparable and competing models: Fuji Finepix S4000, Panasonic DMC-FZ40, Nikon P500 and Canon SX30IS.DSLR (Canon T1i rebel)Positives: Excellent pictures, shortest shutter (non-existent) shutter lag, low light performance, burst speed that no point and shoot on earth will ever match. Only way to go for professional looking pictures that require greater detail.If you can pay up to $850, willing to carry a heavy camera bag with DSLR body, at least two lenses (one normal and one telephoto) and willing to spend time to change lens as the situation demands, go for the DSLR. Carrying a DSLR with 70-300mm zoom in your neck is no fun. It is more than two pounds handing down the neck. More number of times you change lens, more dust will accumulate on the mirror and sensor which may need professional cleaning at some point (every couple of years).I didn't want to carry a huge bag, do not want to change lens frequently, do not want to spend $600 and above for an all-in-one zoom lens alone(18-270 Tamron AF zoom goes for $479 with rebate). It costs close to $1000 for the type of DSLR I want with an all-in-one zoom that fits almost every 'picturable' situation and alleviates the need to change lens frequently and gives me respectable wide-angle and telephoto option. Hence, I returned T1i rebel to stick with a point and shoot.If you are a casual to semi-serious photographer who may want to share pictures, watch them on the monitor or TV, or print 10 x 14 size prints; then you don't notice much difference in image quality between T1i or Canon SX30IS (unless you take low-light, no flash pictures in less than ideal situation). If you want to capture low-light pictures all the time or high speed actions or spectacular shots for competitions, DSLR is the only way to go.Now, if you have decided that you don't want to go DSLR route, which PS (Point and shoot) is the next best.Why I didn't like these following cameras?Why not Fuji finepix S4000?Say, this is like a Kia Optima among the family sized sedans. OK quality and budget minded. 30X zoom but who cares if the lens quality and picture processing are mediocre.Horrendous movie capability. Totally unacceptable. Average picture quality. The camera looks and feels cheap. It is made in China and cannot come close to Japanese build cameras in terms of quality and durability. No offense to anyone, but in my opinion Japanese built cameras are the best. If you are on a budget, you can get this for $230 but you have to compromise on picture quality and live with the worst movie quality. If you want a quality camera, this not an option, despite its 30X zoom. Works on 4AA batteries, zoom is nice but noisy, picture quality is above average in good lighting conditions only.Why not Nikon P500?This is like a Toyota Camry limited edition. Not much different from DMC-FZ40, but way better than Fuji Finepix S4000.First of all, you don't get a battery charger. You have to charge it like a cell phone, directly hooking the charger to the camera. You can buy an after market battery and charger for extra money with arguable quality.Second, its auto focus is horrible. AF will try really hard to focus in low light conditions without much success and leading to blurred pictures. However, in outdoors, it can easily match Canon in overall picture quality. Its LCD is the best.Now, the third worst attribute. It cannot focus clearly while zoooming in a movie mode. While recording a movie, if you zoom, you will have blurred image until you stop zooming and allow the lens to refocus. If you plan to buy the camera for dual purpose (images vs. movies), this is not for you.Fourth and the most important is the image stabilization feature. Compared to Canon SX30IS, its image stabilization, at slightly higher zoom (15x and above) is pathetic. Its like comparing Kia with Lexus. Forget it. Canon is a hands down winner.If you can compromise on all these issues, you can buy this and save $20 over the Canon SX30IS.Features I liked that Canon SX30IS doesn't have: Sweep panorama. Camera records images while you sweep the camera and produces a panoramic picture. No software processing needed on a computer. Very convenient. In Canon SX30IS, you have to do this using 'stitch feature' and process it later with a software. For me, its not a deal breaker. It is also the lightest of these cameras, but Canon SX30IS isn't that heavy, just over a pound.Why not Canon SX30IS?I thought this is the answer for my search for the best point and shoot that can take very good quality pictures and videos with excellent zoom. But in the end, this is not the answer.This like a Toyota Camry, great overall sedan but not something that can knock you off with quality.Great zoom, nice pictures, ok movie quality. For some reason, the movies I shot tend to freeze and have no idea why. May be a bug in the camera software? Shutter lag is very high. Burst speed is very much non-existent. Painfully slow. Cannot capture fast moving actions in spur of the moment since camera take a while to respond, focus and capture the image.Pictures are soft and the color is way off. If I use vivid colors setting, reds are overblown and pictures are horrible. Overall, a decent camera but picture quality isn't razor sharp. Not what you expect from Canon. Indoor videos with decent light is grainy.If you don't have the memory card, can't capture even one image. On FZ40, you can capture upto 10 images of high resolution even if you happen to forget the memory card.Verdict: Not the best. Returned.My final choice:Panasonic DMC-FZ40.Say, this is like a Lexus among the family sedans. Good overall scores. Best camera for the buck.The zoom and autofocus of the camera are the best. Its zoom is the smoothest, fastest and quietest. You do not her any motor sound unless you are in a very quite room and listen very carefully. Outstanding.It can match or out perform Canon SX30IS in still picture quality (still testing). Only 24x zoom, but does the job in majority of situation. Power OIS is great. In fact, the pictures are much sharper and better color saturation over Canon or Nikon. FZ40 has excellent movie options that Canon SX30IS cannot match, especially indoors.Also, its shutter lag and burst options are excellent, better than Canon SX30IS.But, FZ40 is doesn't work well with after market spare battery and you must buy a Panasonic ($40 and above or 15% of the cost of the Camera) battery due to a security feature.  After market battery may work, but you don't have any information displayed (how much battery is left) etc. I have no problems shelling out extra bucks for a quality battery.I think this camera, with comparable or better picture quality and better movie quality than canon, is the my choice. Priced $120 below the Canon SX30IS, it is the best value for the money with outstanding quality. Moreover, its slightly smaller and lighter than Canon. I returned my SX30IS after the trip and bought this for $285.Finally, why I stuck with Panasonic FZ40 instead of T1i rebel?Its smaller, lesser weight and less than half the cost than DSLR with lens kit that can closely come to the range of 35X zoom that SX30IS offers.Positives: Great pictures for most users (up to 8 x 10 sheets with excellent detail), light weight compared to SX30IS, portability, amazing, quieter and faster zoom among the PS cameras (better zooming than Canon), the best HD movie quality for almost all practical purposes with continuous focus maintained during zooming, excellent low-light performance among any point and shoot once you know how to play with manual options and use a tripod, and best bang for the buck.Its shutter lag, start-up time, full-resolution burst speed (upto 2.5 shots/sec can be achieved without flash and high-speed SD card).FZ40 takes 52 mm lens. I had 58 mm lens kit, so I bought an adapter (52 to 58 mm step-up) to use.So, zoom is not everything and Panasonic FZ40 offers the best value for the money.", "Date": "July 1, 2011"}, {"Title": "Quite Disappointed", "Author": "AN", "ReviewID": "R2LNNHM8RBQTUR", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "Sure, the product has an incredible zoom, but I feel like the image quality is much lower than I expected.

My husband who bought the SLR camera for I am guessing 600 bucks 4 years ago and ugh don't want to know how much he spent on lens, filters, bag etc...all of the extras.

Winning \"ewin64\"", "ReviewID": "RS5QA3CJBLS5X", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "This review could be summed up as follows: Take a really good lens with IS, a comfortable, light-weight body, and screw it up by overloading its processor with unnecessary capabilities.I bought and returned the SX30 after two weeks and, because I had some trepidation about a return, I bought locally rather than through Amazon which is my favorite \"retailer.\" When I saw that Canon had brought out a 30x IS digital zoom, and 60% of my photos are of birds, I was bummed that I had just gotten the SX20IS. If you know waterfowl at all, you know they tend to sit in the middle of a pond. They do not come 20 feet from you and pose. In 2010, I has seven of my photos published in birding magazines (and eight of muskrats, spiders and dragonflies in nature mags). You can see these photos on my web site which, because Amazon has to be careful, can only be described as my first and last name.com.Why the preface? It's necessary, that's why. Too many people do not realize that the more bells and whistles Canon (and the rest) put on a camera diminishes the capability of the chip to handle the bells or the whistles or both.The SX10 and the SX20 had one problem which was bad enough, and just got worse with the SX30: low light photos are terrible or terribly hard. I'm not speaking of taking pictures of a birthday party when at least you might have light from the conflagration of Aunt Marta's 91 candles lighting up the room. I'm talking about an overcast day, even a day when it's bright, but no sunlight. The kind of day when a 35mm camera could compensate and using film with an ASA of 400 didn't create so much noise that you tossed the photo.With the Canons, a subject at 50 feet under the canopy of a tree is darn near impossible. And don't use the flash because with animals' retinas reflect white or grey which cannot be corrected with red-eye correction. And with raptors, don't even think of PhotoShop to get rid of grey eye.If that was all, I would have kept the camera for sunny day shooting. But no, there are other negatives as well. A preface to this list is that I REALLY WANTED this to work. Who wouldn't? The equivalent of over 700mm telephoto in a 20 ounce camera would bet the dream of any nature photographer.Pros: It does take decent - not fantastic - photos at full zoom under the right conditions.Canon brought back the tether for the lens cap. Whoopee! Took 'em long enough and makes you wonder if they read comments from end-users.Cons: Low-light photography is difficult if not impossible, and I use everything from A, V, and M to Program and Auto and all those special circumstance lighting (e.g., night or fireworks) to no avail.Canon went to a proprietary battery instead of my AA rechargeable batteries which I have been using on the SX10 and 20 as well as every other gadget in my arsenal. (The Eneloops will last long enough for about 700 photos taken at full resolution including some flash shots.) I carry a set of those batteries in the car, and a set in my pocket when I remember. They hold their charge for well over a year, but that's another review.The difference between 24mm and 28mm wide-angle doesn't make much of a difference to me even when taking shots of Yosemite Valley. There comes a point when reality is compromised. I know full well when, at one time 20 years ago, I became enamored with my Olympus Zuiko fish eye lens and for about a year, the whole world was presented as a small-mouth bass would see it.This camera is slooooooow. Even on a good day, i.e., sunny, you can't snap off 3-5 shots in less than 8-10 seconds. Reset is also slow, and I suggest you turn off the LCD and use viewfinder only.The difference between 12.1 and 14 MP is negligible. First of all, by pushing the SX30 to 14.1 MP, the software and CMOS has to struggle to do everything that is asked of it. I want to make a point that I do not use PhotoShop: what I see is most often what I get with one exception. I am not opposed to cropping. I can take a photo with the SX20 and crop it and get a better photo than the SX30. If I were to put up some of my dragonfly and damselfly photos, anyone who has used these two (or three) cameras would know that the sharper images can from the SX20. They would have more difficulty in determining those taken with the SX10 and SX20.The macro is neither better now worse than the SX20. Oddly, my wife's teeny Canon SD1100IS 8MP takes better macros and super-macros than either of these. The best part of the S3, S5, SX10, SX20, and SX30 is the articulated LCD and the only time I use it is for macros or when I have to aim over a fence.While I should be thrilled that my SX20 is good for a few more years (or months), I'm terribly disappointed, in part because I want to stick to a \"point-and-shoot\" (a misnomer for anything this sophisticated). I do not want to fall into the trap of a DSLR with a body and 4 lenses and 35 pounds of stuff to carry with me. Besides, I've already made my reputation as \"The Point-and-shoot Nature Photographer.\" I like having the skill set to use these Canons, but I do wish that Canon didn't feel it necessary to sell me something like the SX30 just because six months has gone by and the LAW is that they have to come up with something new every 6 months.Last word: Note that the description of the camera and the shots taken by the camera were all taken in bright light. When the SX40 comes out - unless this is Canon's way of forcing everyone into a DSLR - I'll try it if they show a photo of a bird in a tree, Aunt Marta's 92 birthday indoors, and an indoor graduation ceremony from 100 feet away. Oh, and then, I want a macro of a jumping spider showing all 8 eyes tack sharp.", "Date": "December 27, 2010"}, {"Title": "Just too good for the price..

Stick to the point and shoot cameras.  Sit down and take some time to read the manual and play with all the buttons to understand what each button does.  Understand the features of the camera. I have learnt over time that if you are going to use a large zoom factor, everything is magnified.  Even a small movement is amplified 35 times.  So use a TRIPOD to take those far away pictures.  This is a NO-BRAINIER. the F numbers or the F-Stops as they were referred to in the old days, are aperture sizes.  The smaller the number the larger the opening and larger the F-stop smaller the aperture opening.  Smaller aperture openings tent to give sharper images across the entire photo shot. The older film cameras had a button to check the depth of field at various aperture openings.  That gave you an idea what is in focus and what is not at that F#.Do not knock the camera just because you do not understand the intricasies of the camera or the technology.  I know that the camera manufacturers offer features that are not always equal to or the same as the other manufacturers.

The zoom lens does a wonderful job in its optical mode and the fact that there is a viewfinder in addition to a viewing screen is a big plus.  It make it easier to take pictures hand held.  The ability to rotate and reposition the viewing screen is a great improvement over many cameras on the market today.  It allows you to shoot over the heads of people or holding the camera at waste level.

For it's price and weight it is a wonderful instument to take pictures when you don't feel like carrying a SLR and a lot of lenses.

Many of them speak about the low-light picture quality being a little worse (when compared to other similar cameras).  I think the low-light picture issue is a slight problem.  If that's your primary need, then I would avoid this camera.  I wish I could have given 4 and half stars instead of 5 for that reason.However, it has been the only problem I've found since getting the camera and running a few dozen test pictures and video over the last two weeks.  But, when compared to my previous camera, the low-light picture quality is much better (7 megapixel Kodak).  One area that is absolutely wonderful is the video quality.  This camera is now my perferred method of taking video.  (I was using a Mini DV camera before.)Of course, if you're reading this review, it's because the 35X zoom caught your attention.  Yes, it's everything you expect.  Probably the most important feature with the zoom is the button that pulls the picture back so you can find your subject again...and then it goes back to the original telephoto setting once you release the button.  It does this quickly and is a great help when zoomed in very tightly.The menu system is a little confusing at times.  But I've already mastered the items I use the most.  Recently, I was using this camera on the ski slopes and found that the zoom and the \"snow\" setting worked very well.  Also, I could get the camera out of the case, turned on, and taking pictures in just seconds.  Several of my videos required zooming in on a subject that was more than 100 yards away.  The image stabilization worked well during these shots.If you're looking for a general all around \"mega zoom\" camera, then this should be one of the finalist in your search.", "Date": "February 22, 2011"}, {"Title": "What is WRONG with the picture quality?", "Author": "C. Butler", "ReviewID": "R1QNAR8KM5Y18T", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "This is my first Canon, which I bought after using different Kodaks for eight years. Being a newspaper reporter, I have training as a photographer, and I have even won two photography awards for my work in newspapers (even though I am primarily a writer), so I'm hardly a novice when it comes to cameras. I take about 2,000 pictures per year that I add to my personal collection.I decided it was time for me to evolve beyond Kodak and onto some of the better, more expensive brands (the sales reps strongly referred me to get either Canon or Nikon, which are supposedly the two best brands). My Kodak had 8 MP and 12X zoom capacity. I've missed out on some great shots because 12X zoom capacity simply wasn't enough. I was attracted to this Canon camera specifically because of the 35X zoom capacity. I never once questioned what the quality of the photos would be, given Canon's reputation, and give the fact that this camera has more megapixels.I saved up enough money for this camera and bought it just in time for the holidays......UNFORTUNATELY, the pictures I took with this camera are no better quality-wise than the pictures I've taken with my iPhone (which might have all of 4 MP). I seriously regret selling my Kodak (which produced rich, VIBRANT photos) in favor of this Canon. I am honestly befuddled at how a $400 camera could end up producing photos that are inferior in quality to my $200 Kodak (and this is even AFTER I used my computer to enhance the photos).I think I'm going to have to sell this camera in favor of something better, because these low-quality photos are simply unacceptable (and yes, I DID READ THE OWNER'S MANUAL, especially the part about pressing the shutter button halfway at first).FOLLOW UP (12-26-10): I have been reading the 196 page instruction manual (which is only available by uploading a CD into your computer. The paper version that comes in the box is extremely short and NOT nearly as detail-oriented, which was another mistake on Canon's part).I see I have a long way to go toward learning how to work this thing. I have noticed that if I keep the camera on Portrait mode AND standard single shot mode at the same time then I will produce the same high quality images I got out of my old Kodak. Unfortunately, so far, the images in every other setting are still grainy. I will update as warranted (any advice is most appreciated).FOLLOW UP (12-27-10): I am learning more about this model (see the responses to this review) and suggest that anyone having problems spend the proper amount of time familiarizing themselves with the 200-page instruction manual (as opposed to the 30 page one). This is a very complex camera, but one I believe will take quality pictures if the owner is willing to evolve beyond what is simple (that's why I bought this camera in the first place) and have a better grasp of the mechanics of photography.

It does have and adapter for an external flash that I never use but whose to say what will happen tomorrow.  The flash is pretty strong and I use it often.  The video performance is incredible. It has a little control for adjusting the brightness of the video while it's running and I have found that to be extremely useful in low light conditions.

The cool thing about shooting the video is that you don't have to keep the camera still all of the time and when you review the video your getting 30 frames per second so your almost always going have some images that are worth keeping if your relatively careful and steady with the camera.  I purchased an extra charger and battery and I always grab a new battery on my way out.  I've shot up to 12 Gigs of video with one battery. The battery and memory are in the same compartment which is a slight nuisance since you will have to remove any quick disconnect adapters in order to open the compartment.  The good news is that 32G cards are readily available and the batteries last a long time so you never really have to get into that compartment very often in normal use.  The zoom lens is quiet and smooth.  It's not completely linear but it is repeatable and easy to get use to. My only real gripe is that it's not easy to use manual focus.  If you want to focus on an animal that's behind some brush the only sensible thing to do is to focus on something else about that distance away and hold the button in it's first position and move the camera over to take the picture.

Faster is even better.Low light focus is slow and inaccurate. My Panasonics and other Canons do a better job more consistently. Image sharpness is not as high as my other cameras and I have to work harder in Photoshop to get an equally sharp photo but it never really gets to a high enough level of sharpness. On balance, I will use the sx30 when I need the extreme zoom and will use my Canon G12 for everything else. The G12 does produce really sharp and detailed pictures.720 movies are terrific. This is a feature I didn't need but am using a lot anyway. It is a little hard to hold the camera out from my head for long shots but the eyelevel finder, which image is very small, works ok for video even though it is pretty crude in sharpness to look at. Having autofocus and zoom for video in a still camera is awesome and appreciated. There is an intermittent vignetting in the lower right corner during video of a moving things like horses and cars. It might be the Image Stabilization trying to keep up with the movement during video shooting. It's not crucial but should not be there at this stage of technology. I would like an easier way to adjust the shutter speed and aperture manually. You have to switch back and forth now and do not have both displays open at once.

I've had mine over 1 year and used it for several purposes, including family vacation photos and also for documentation purposes at work.  It's held together just fine.  Because it's your typical slow, clunky, point-and-shoot, I don't use it for sports or action photos at all.  For those things, I use a DSLR.  In most photos from this camera, I notice both graininess and softness when viewed at full size.  The zoom 35x is a good feature to have, but it don't count on having quality images when you max out the zoom.  If you want high quality shots from this camera, you should use it a close range and in good light.Besides not needing to change lenses, the only advantage I can see for this camera vs. a DSLR is the fact that it does shoot fairly good video.  However, it's not ergonomically good to hold it and shoot video for a long perid of time.  You'll get tired and you might even drop it.  But, if you have the need for occasional, short video clips, it's great.Also, it's worth noting that the price has actually risen on this camera since I purchased it.  When I bought it last year, it was $400 plus shipping.  At the time of this review, it's gone up to $450.

For a bit of background, most of my photo shooting is done while hiking and Geocaching. I take a LOT of shots, animals, insects, plants, dew drops, whatever caches my eye at the time. I really like getting in close, especially with insects and plants. Further, most of the time I'm taking \"snapshots\". Photos where I don't have much time to set-up, take readings, steady the camera, etc. I'm talking about a grasshopper that happens to land within a foot of me or a fellow hiker doing something photo worthy at the spur of the moment.I've had the camera for some months now and have formed some opinions. On the good side the 35X optical zoom is great. I was able to get a fantastic, tight framed close up of a Red Tailed Hawk sitting on a fence post, seemingly glaring back at me. Because of the type of shots I often take, the tiltable/adjustable LCD screen is one of the most useful functions on the camera (I'd have a hard time going without one). My videos always come out just fine, though I don't often use that capability. Being able to zoom in and out without pausing the video is a nice bonus.Now, the not so good, regrettably, there is more I dislike about the camera than I like. The unit replaced my old S3, which was rather bulky, but I was still able to carry it on my hikes in a pouch on my belt. Not so with the SX30IS. This sucker is big and bulky. The only practical way to carry it is either in my backpack, which makes it inaccessible for snapshots, or as I usually carry it, on a neck strap, where it's always in danger of being snagged or bumped on something hard, not to mention... it's a pain in the neck, literally.There are two buttons, that after many hundreds of shots, I still accidently, on a very regular basis, activate. The first is the \"menu\" button, which by the way the camera fits in my hands, my palm hits this button simply by virtue of holding the camera. The other, is the \"zoom framing assist\" button. This button, in concept is really an innovative idea. When zooming on a distant subject, it can be very hard to locate your target, the zoom assist, when pressed, zooms out, and once you find your subject you release the button and it goes right back to the zoomed in level originally chosen. The problem, it's made too convenient, right on the very edge where your thumb naturally grasps the camera. Activating either of these functions when not intended  is very distracting and cause for missing desired shots.The previously mentioned dislikes are minor compared to my main complaints. As already mentioned, I take mostly snapshots, and need the camera to focus and adjust the exposure quickly and accurately. This is where the camera really falls down on the job. Using the \"Smart\" AUTO function the majority of my shots are both out-of-focus and poorly exposed. I'm not talking sometimes, or half the time, I'm talking MOST OF THE TIME. I guess the more accurate \"Dumb AUTO\" would not have been a good selling point. After much experimenting, now my default setting is \"P\" (programmed AE), which usually (not nearly \"always\") gives me well focused shots, but, in anything other than bright full sunlight, usually gives me poorly exposed shots, with extreme pixelation.More on exposures, it is not rare at all to need/desire fill flash, but, alas, to do so with this camera requires a complex, time consuming, set of steps and often the auto-exposure results are still unacceptable.The macro close-up function also provides very inconsistent/poor results. I've had excellent results with previous cameras, getting hand-held shots of, for example, a honey bee gathering pollen at the end of a wispy flower stem, while simply holding lens very near the insect but not taking the time to use the view finder (or LCD). Not with this camera. You would consider yourself lucky if you get 1 out of 5 shots to come out as usable... and that's taking the time to use the LCD.My decision to purchase this camera was based on my general satisfaction with my previous camera, a Canon Powershot S3, which had its weak points, but was overall a good camera that took a beating on the trails and gave me some great photographs with a minimum of effort. Then there were the \"professionally written\" reviews, which mostly highly praised this camera. What little negatives I found had always been followed with a counter offsetting positive point guiding me away from potential problems. I researched this purchase much more than previous digital cameras and it turned out to be my worst.I'm no \"photographer\", I'm a hobbyist that has expectations built up from years of \"playing\" with cameras and having what I believe to be reasonable expectations for a point and shoot camera.  As an unequal comparison, but providing me with some minimum standards, I have a very old Sony DSC-W5 that I use as a back-up camera, it is a rare event that I get a poorly exposed shot and out-of-focus shots are as rare as a 5 megapixal camera. It only requires a single button press to force the flash for fill. Alas, after years of use, at some point this camera has picked up some lens aberrations on the edges and can't be trusted to fill my needs.The Canon Powershot SX30IS camera has not nearly lived up to expectations and I would not recommend it.", "Date": "June 15, 2011"}, {"Title": "Great Superzoom!", "Author": "Chris", "ReviewID": "R2CSQRYJH27OZR", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I purchased this camera from Amazon for Christmas as a replacement for my 3mp Fuji S5000.

Although the camera does seem a little smaller than the SX10 and SX20. The camera has lots of features and offers a full manual set of shooting features which are very easy to manipulate if you're into manual shooting. I like the Electronic Viewfiner... comes in very handy in bright, sunny conditions when the LCD is not easily visible. The LCD swings out and swivels. Unfortunatley it's somewhat low resolution. I find the overall layout of the camera very easy to use and navigate through - it's pretty similar to most of the other Canon point and shoots. It also has a hot shoe for adding things like an external flash. Unfortunatley it does not support RAW photos like the Panasonic does.The photo quality is very good - on par with other high-end point and shoots. Good color saturation and decent sharpness. Although, again, you would not confuse it for a DSLR. The 35x zoom works well, although, as with other aspects of the cameras performance, operates at a rather leisurely pace. This camera is not reccomended for action shots - in the Superzoom category - the Panasonic Lumix FZ100 is a better choice if you want fast performance.I reccomend this camera for folks who want a little more than your average point and shoot and also it's a decent choice for newbie photography hobbyists.

I have to say, the Canon beat the others in many aspects. Although the sensor is small given the 14MP cramped to it, the images are very pleasing. For example, the noise level is way less than the P100 (which has a CMOS sensor).  Also, you can reduce ISO up to 80 in good light conditions, which greatly reduces the noise.  The zoom is so powerful and the stabilizer works like a charm.  The flip LCD also comes in handy in different situations where the VF or a fixed LCD is not enough. You can maneuver the LCD the way you like. What made this one pops in respect to the other zoom P&S; is the flexibility. Once you improve your photo skills you will want to explore new things.  It has hot shoe for external flash, which would be a necessity for portrait, indoor or nice micro shots.  Using a lens adapter, you can use filters (both screw in or slide (Cokin, for example) which facilitates having great landscape pictures.

P100 was able to shoot 40fps in burst more which was neat!!! Also, due to the fast rate, the P100 had a slow motion video capabilities.2- The build. P100 was metallic (maybe aluminum), which made it look like sturdy and able to take couple accidental bumps now and then. This one is made of plastic.

In the requirement zoom and image stabilization, there are no competitors that come near the SX30IS. You can get excellent pictures by hand using the 35X zoom. But in low light conditions the user must know how to use the resources and / or tripod to get sharp photos. (When using a tripod, the image stabilization must be switched off)- The menu is easy to use and intuitive. The LCD Flip-out screen is the best among the competitors, being very clear.- There are several features to take great photos. I'm still reading the manual and I can not use all resources, but the pictures and movies are improving as I know the camera better.- The movies are good qualityCons:- The greatest shortcoming of the camera is to have low FPS, because the camera does not take many pictures per second. In this variable the superzoom competitors are way better.- Do not shoot in full HD, though HD movies are already very good. It could have 3-inch screen instead of 2.7.- No High-speed frame rate (slow motion) in the movies. This feature is present in the competitors.

I bought the SX30is for an upcoming trip to Alaska.  It is small enough not to feel bulky, but big enough to fit in your hand like a DSLR. It's very lightweight, which makes it easy to have around your neck for long periods without feeling like a brick. The controls are very intuitive, with more than enough menu/function options for the average amateur. The zoom is Amazing! The Image stabilization works great. This camera is a replacement for a Nikon Coolpix L120 I bought last month and returned because of the poor image stabilization. The Nikon's image stabilization was very shaky and hard to get used to. Canon got it right with it's IS.Cons: The zoom assist button is too close to where you naturally place your thumb, and sometimes gets accidentally depressed. The issue only compounds itself when operating the camera with gloves on. The zoom did lock-up on me once, but rebooting fixed it. The flash has to be manually raised in order to operate. Just something to get used to.Overall the Canon Sx30is is an exceptional camera for the money.

There's also a low light program setting which comes in very handy. It's fun to play with the exposure at baseball games.I've enjoyed taking fisheye pictures of my dog. He's not as thrilled though. B&W; pictures come out very nice and there's also a sepia setting which was new and cool to me. We did the Kentucky Bourbon trail last summer. It was fun to play with the sepia and b&w; settings but insert one color such as red at the Maker's Mark distillery.The zoom is fantastic! I was able to get really great pictures of the Statue of Liberty from the Empire State Building. I've never been able to even see any detail with other cameras I've had.

I used my Canon S5 all the time and got great pictures out of it in most situations.  I know the limits of point and shoot cameras so I didn't expect the world from the S5.  I wanted and upgrade and saw the SX30 IS.  I still didn't expect the world from it either, but I do have some expectations.The SX30 IS takes good pictures from an extreme lens, and 35x is surely as extreme as it gets.  When you have one lens to cover that large of a range in a point and shoot, you can't expect SLR quality.  My problem is, past about halfway zoomed out, I started getting a lot of vignetting in the top corners.  And it's weird, because the top left corner doesn't do it as bad as the top right corner and I don't notice it in the bottom corners.  If I can't zoom out more than halfway without cropping off the top section of the photo, what good is the rest of the zoom range?  This is even worse when you try to stitch photos together and the top right corner is shadowed and the top left corner of the next photo is quite a bit brighter.I have owned 10 Canon digital cameras, from cheap point and shoot up to the Digital Rebel Xsi.  I have only been unhappy with two and this was far more disappointing as it was significantly more expensive than the A570 that overexposed everything.

The video quality is good but you will need conversion software to play or upload it to your PC. However after using it for 4 months there are some very annoying flaws.  In moderate low light it won't focus real well.  It will also take pics that will have a \"painted\" fusion of color with no detail.  Much like a color overexposure.Most annoying is the zoom is very slow responding and sometime won't zoom until you take a pic and it resets.  It will also be zoomed out and it will auto zoom back in.  It ends up being a tug-o-war and I have missed many pics because of that flaw.  The auto focus while zoomed is not real good and 50% of the time it will be out of focus.  The manual focus is completely worthless since it's done with the tiny rotary wheel on the back.  It takes forever and the LCD won't let you get a good read on how crisp it is.I have owned several of the smaller Canon Powershots and they have been great overall cameras.  And I am going back to using my SX120 IS 12 MP more often.  Save your money and go for the EOS series or go with the compact Suppershot and Powershot series.

I owned a good Pentax SLR before digital cameras hit the market. The Canon SX30IS is more like a D-SLR than it is a P&S.; I have a lot of learning to do. So far I still shoot better photos with my old Sony DSC-W5, but I'm sure that is my own ineptitude. I'll add more once I get through this 200 page PDF file that is the excuse for a manual. I have to agree with other reviewers on this one. I don't have a computer with me when I'm out taking pictures, so the PDF manual is useless in that regard.Well, it's been three months since I purchased the Canon SX30 IS camera. I'm not very pleased, to put it as nicely as possible. I'll leave my true feelings out of the review and do my best to present the facts without adding negatively biased opinions.When I purchased this camera, the intent was to get photos of wild animals. A few good examples would be a Bald Eagle in flight or a goose making a water landing.I have not yet been able to get even one single sharply focused picture when I have the Optical zoom set towards the higher end (say 20X to 35X). I have tried setting all possible Auto-Focus options to every position in an attempt to get the camera to focus clearly. I also use a tripod, and have the self-timer set to two seconds. The camera is stable and untouched when the shutter fires, however the subject of my picture is still slightly blurred. Even when the subject is inanimate and stationary. Pretty poor performance.I have contacted Canon support and read all of the knowledge base articles concerning focus. There is no help there (that is not already in in the mega-manual), and none of it gave me any sharply focused photographs when I tried the ideas they had. I have a trouble ticket (which I wrote today) in with Canon now to see if it's possible that I've missed something. If so, I'm a lot dumber than I thought I was. I've spent the last three months trying different options and settings.Bottom line: I'm going to take the loss and return this camera. It takes great portraits, but I can get a much less expensive point-and-shoot for that. The lesson learned?

If I cannot explore the best feature of DSLR, it will not do me any good. This camera has all the features I want. (2) If I don't have to learn to use DSLR, there is no point to spend almost $1,000 for a decent DSLR.Most of my photos were taken in good light condition and the quality of those photos were excellent. For the photos in poor light condition, the flash light help. Also, without a manual, it is easy to figure out the settings of the camera after a few tries.There are something that I want to complain about this camera though:1. I wish that Canon can have automatic cover for the lens just like other PowerShot series camera. Sometimes it is a little bit annoying to remove the cover when you see something you want to capture and it is passing by.2. There is a button right below the on-off button which automatically set the camera to the scene and surrounding condition. If you accidentally press this button, it will automatically adjust the zoom and other settings and you cannot change it. I did not realize it until this happened three to four times.3. The battery runs out fast. It requires recharge about every 300 - 350 photos. So, it is better to take extra battery if you are on a road trip.I think it is wrong to compare this camera with DSLR camera. They are different types of cameras. I won't expect it to perform as well as a DSLR camera. I have to say that in order to get the best out of a camera (any camera), some basic knowledge and techniques of photography should be needed.

I wish the photos were better...especially in marginal (overcast sky) lighting...surprisingly grainy.  I've had this camera for about a month and found the following flaws too hard to live with:- Camera is somewhat hard to hold and some buttons are encumbered by the neck strap.- No thread for filters...you have to buy an adapter.- No remote control capability...I've not been able to find any such feature.- Slow response time between shots.- Does not produce 1080p video.- CCD based...good for video but poor low light performance.The differences in the 14+ Mpixel images between the SX30IS and the 50D are way too significant.  I was hoping image quality would be somewhat close; thus, mixing similar photos between the cameras would result in marginal differences.  I hope Canon fixes these problems in the next SX release.  Again, the range of the lens is absolutely amazing.UPDATE:I took three cameras (all Canons...50D, SD940IS and SX30IS) to Italy and compared results.  My tiny SD940IS worked wonders in all modes to include Auto...not true for SX30IS...great results all around for the 50D. In fact, the SD940IS performed incredibly well in low light conditions. Indoor photos taken inside the Duomo (cathedral next to the Leaning Tower of Pisa) on a snowy overcast day produced results on SD940IS that almost kept up with my 50D. The SX30IS' photos were darker, grainy and somewhat blurry. I tested the SX30IS and SD940IS in both  Auto and P modes...great results almost all the time on SD940IS; not true for SX30IS.  The SX30IS auto mode couldn't find a consistent shooting mode and were confused by the faces found on the statues and frescoes.  I'm dropping the rating to 2 stars (from 3).  If the zoom range wasn't there then I'd give it just 1 star.BTW, another missing feature: GPS.  The camera is pretty bulky; thus, I'm sure Canon could have included a small GPS receiver.  In fact, carrying this camera was almost as much a challenge as carrying my SLR.  In fact, this camera takes up almost all the space inside my Canon Rebel XTi case...surprisingly large.One final note: I've been a Canon fan for some 25 years now.

The light little compact allows you to move off the beaten track in search of the owner of that taunting bird call and the low light performance gets you that shot. If the hyperactive bird is behind too much foliage for a clean picture, there's always the very nice video fallback.The pros would likely consider it only as a back-up. Nobody brings along thousands of dollars of heavy equipment just on the off chance something interesting might turn up, but for the causal birder who wants evidence of their encounters, this is nice and quick. Add a Raynox DCR 150 - Converter and you can take great micro-shots, but that'll take some practice.Sometimes it's a chore to get the camera to focus on your small subject with noisy background, the same happens when the dragon fly is less than a meter away. The trick is to step back a little and zoom in, as the working distance for the 840mm zoom is 1.4m. Forget bird in flight unless it's just hanging in the sky.

The camera performs admirably in outside conditions and normal conditions with subjects a few feet away. The problem comes in when you have low light conditions, backlit conditions and when you apply the 35x zoom. This is with a tripod to compensate for shake. The camera just does not produce crisp details and the photos do not have the color, depth and details I am used to even with my compact Leica camera. Also since the low light photos were less than optimal, I had to return the camera. Like I say in my title, this camera has potential and I hope they fix the issues thru a firmware update.", "Date": "July 7, 2011"}, {"Title": "if only the pictures were as good as the features.....", "Author": "t. calahan", "ReviewID": "R2EQ6KY5CJQPGH", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "i got this camera as my sweet 16 present. i researched cameras FOREVER to find the one i thought would be best. i found the sx30 and was really, really excited to get it. as soon as i opened it i started taking pictures, and my only reaction was \"...huh.\" the pictures were not great. i kept chalking it up to bad lighting or my lack of photography experience or not knowing how to change the settings but the fact is, the pictures aren't anything special. they have no dimension or depth to them. they look totally flat. the auto focus is terrible....if you're trying to take a picture of something close, it WILL.NOT.FOCUS.CLEARLY. even in macro mode. the lowlight is TERRIBLE. the background of the pictures are always grainy and really bad looking. the artistic features are really, really nice though. i also like that it's a li-ion battery as opposed to AAs, which disappear in no time. the battery charges fast and lasts a looong time. it's pretty easy to navigate, but it's difficult to change iso settings and things like that. it also bugs me that it has no ability to swap out lenses or put lens hoods on. but i guess that's what i get for buying a digital disguised as an slr. it seems like it has oodles more features than any other camera i've used, but the image quality is just bugging me so much. good for amateur photographers, but if you're serious about photography you won't be happy with the images. if you're gonna invest big bucks for a camera, spend the extra couple hundred and buy almost any other camera but this one. i've seen people's iphones take clearer shots. i regret deciding on this model and having my parents pitch in so much for something so not worth it.", "Date": "June 19, 2011"}, {"Title": "Great Camera", "Author": "Clown1957 \"lone wolf\"", "ReviewID": "R38NP7O20UILCH", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I check at retail stores and talked to salesmen and got their recommendations then checked on Amazon.com and found this camera and it was over $100 cheaper to buy it on Amazon.

I take a lot of photos, however, mainly scenery, family, and pets.I've had this camera for 8 months, and for the most part, it does get the job done. The 'burst,' however (how quickly you can take one picture after shooting the first) is a bit slow. Even with a faster memory card, there is still a 3-5 second delay between shots.Also, the camera does not accommodate a cable, which means you have to take all pictures by pushing the button on the camera. This can be a problem for shots where you need greater stability (such as a close-up of a flower).As noted elserwhere on this site, the telephoto is a bit fickle, as it tries to determine what you're taking a picture of, even if it's wrong. I've tried photographing birds in flight, for example, and the camera gets nutty, not sure where to zero in on. Switching to P-mode is sometimes helpful, though for some reason, many of the photos come out blue.To get around some of these issues, I purchased a Lumix, but I found it less hands-friendly than this one. The Canon, for example, fits nicely in my hands; the lens cap comes off with ease; the view-finder/door in the back open easily; and viewing photos on the screen is quick/easy.The camera does attach easily to a tripod, which is a plus.The flash is manual, so it doesn't pop up automatically or by the push of a button.The lens is not interchangeable, but it does have good close-up and good telephoto (the video posted above really gives you a good feel for the ease and range of the lens).I'm basically pleased with this camera. I just wish it had faster 'burst' and the capacity to attach a cable.

Makes everything in the center frame look like toys.The macro shots are absolutely awesome, and the possibilities are endless as to what you can shoot. Apply some imagination and get some great shots that are incredibly detailed for a camera in this price range.The zoom and focus points are truly incredible. We have a couple of PnS's that have pretty decent zoom and great focus, and this camera is untouchable in both those aspects. Add the image stabilization utilized with the furthest reaches of zoom, and the shots are great and very detailed.The nicest part is the ease of use and user menus. The battery life is astounding. The fact that it's not bulky or heavy makes it the perfect all-around camera in my eyes, light and fits into a small enough case that's it's comfortable and hassle-free to carry even while riding a bike or hiking.Auto and low light are not its strong points, but very livable and easy to work around. The manual features are great attributes of this camera. I'm not a big fan of auto settings and the fact that you can set your own aperture, shutter, ISO and focus make this a no-brainer if you're asking what to buy.As always, Amazon's service is the best, and among the best prices.

Still playing with certain settings and compositions learning all its abilities and shortcomings. Auto focus could be faster and has a lot of room for improvement.

I'm doing my best with producing excellent photos and videos with colors, depth, shadowing, angles, closeups and infinity shots, with my 20 years photographic experiences during my travels around the world. This is about the best Canon for amateur photographers. However, be aware of the HD video shooting. Below are 4 each of my main concerns with this Canon SX30IS. I have a few other concerns but they're less important. I gave this Canon 3 stars because my con issues should not have been issues with this slightly advanced HD digital.Cons:1. Low-light encourages graininess.2. Zooming on subjects produces slow focusing issues.3. Touchy fast zooming issues.3. Beware of the Zoom Framing Assist function while holding the camera during video. I made that mistake while shooting alive music performance at a Habitat for Humanity fund raising function. The lens started zooming in-and-out on theperformers until I'd figured out that my hand was accidentally depressing the Framing Assist button off-and-on.Pros:1. Excellent battery life.2. Lightweight body.3. Menu & function buttons easy access.4. Vari-angle LCD is exemplary and now mandatory for all my shooting.

After 6 months analysis, I purchased canon sx30 camera and used it for 6 months. Surprisingly all ratings in Amazon(1 to 5) are absolutely correct. My rating for this camera is 3 stars.Why?Here it goes. Story started when I purchased camera in December. What a terrible initial days with this camera. As soon as I had received, I was very eager to click my sweety daughter actions. All photos are washed out, grainy, blurry. Yet, it produced very good photos when light condition was very good.As I was novice, then I faulted myself to learn camera tricks before blaming reputed manufacturer.Auto mode, auto auto!! Never got a single picture. Then I realized this camera is very poor in auto mode, it doesn't matter what condition you are in. It selects all wrong settings.Started learning all photography basics. Then moved to P mode. Again as this camera needs where good lighting condition, only some of the photos came good as long as I  selected correct ISO settings (Not less, not more it should be right ISO which is impossible to set when you click). I shot same photos with different ISO. What a pain!!!Again back to square, started learning advanced photography to use this camera. Moved to Av & Tv mode. Here I started getting excellent pictures (some are near to DSLR).This camera can't take Kids, pets actions in any mode other than Tv/Manual mode. One has to carefully play in Tv mode with ISO and flash to produce excellent Kids action photos.Manual mode. This is the mode where camera got ratings. Amazing photos! Like any other canon DSLR camera near to that. Colors and details are very good.Sports mode selects high ISO. So forget this mode.I bought this camera for high zoom assuming I would get same photo quality like any other Canon advanced camera. This was not upto my expectation. Story ended and I sold this camera with little loss.Bottomline: If you want to shoot (every scenario) in good lighting condition(mostly stills), Zoom is a must for your photography and want to spend some time like me in learning this camera I would recommend.If you are looking for quick clicks/Kids/action shots then I wouldn't recommend this camera.

If I were the manufacturer of camera's I would want to have pleased and satisfied customers and not have so many of my camera's shipped back to the seller. Like so many of us, I basically want an easy to work with camera, that delivers beautiful pictures, without having to drag a heavy DSLR body and multiple lenses around and without having to deal with technical issues when making photo's. So a point and shoot camera is the best option for someone like me! Without going into detailed technical issues I'll share my experiences on the SX30IS with you. Before I purchased the SX30IS from Amazon, I have been working with the Canon Powershot G5 for about 6 years. I have always been very satisfied with the quality of the pictures that the G5 provides! The main reasons why I wanted another camera was that the Canon Powershot G5 is a pretty slow operating camera, I wanted more zoom range and I wanted higher resolution photo's. The SX30IS seems to provide all this. After having used the SX30IS for about 1 hour, it was clear to me that this camera is a huge downgrade in comparison to the older Powershot G5. The Powershot SX30IS still is a very slow camera. It has a very slow powerburst (calling this powerburst a powerburst is just ridiculous). The powerburst of the older Canon Powershot G5 is a lot faster than the SX30IS and the quality of the SX30IS pictures is not up to par. Pictures are by far not as sharp as the G5 pictures and also the colors are not as vibrant! When comparing the pictures of the newer Powershot SX30IS to the pictures of the older Powershot G5, the older G5 pictures are a true pleasure to view and the G5 stands out by far! Of course I don't know.., but as far as I am able to tell, this is due to the fact that Canon dismissed the Super Fine setting from the newer models. The older Powershot G5 has 3 settings: Normal, Fine and Super Fine. The newer SX30IS only has 2 settings: Normal and Fine. The difference in picture quality is obvious! A photo camera is for taking beautiful photo's. That's all there is to it!!  No matter how many fancy technical features they stick on a camera to impress the customer, the bottom line is and will always be the quality of the pictures we make with them. And the pictures of the Canon Powershot SX30IS do not cut it! I've shipped the camera back to Amazon and as usual Amazon was very good about refunding the money.

However, I have gotten really nice pictures using some of the more basic settings, and I have gotten some really nice pictures using the manual settings for apature and exposure.  This is not your basic point and shoot camera, although I've gotten more than acceeptable pictures using it as such. My less expensive Canon SD 850 IS is a better camera for pure point-and-shoot than the SX30 IS.  This should not be construed as a put-down of the SX30.  This camera will do so much more than the 850 - and that is reflected in the price differential. The SX30 IS is a great camera.  Although slightly heavier than some of the competition, weight is not an issue.  This is still a light camera, but it feels like you are holding something.  The 35x zoom is incredible. This was my primary reason for purchasing the camera and I have not been disappointed.  Image stabilization was also a requirement for me, and again, I have not been disappointed. Plenty of review cover a lot of the other bells and whistles on the camera - all worth having.  However, you can set the camera to take a picture when someone winks, or when someone smiles, or when someone enters the cameras view; and. the camera won't take a picture if someone's eyes are closed. These are all controlled by settings in the camera's program.  They are really nice to have when shooting pictures of the entire family.  A word of caution here for prospective buyers: You have to read the manual (on the enclosed CD) to learn about these and other \"tricks\" the camera can do.  If you aren't into reading manuals then you might think this is just another camera that will work as a point-and-shoot but has a lot of other buttons and dials.

I live in Hong Kong, so there's always great opportunities to take cityscapes.The problem is that after experimenting with all manner of aperture values, shutter speed and ISO...I am getting 9 out of ten photos that are very smeared and poor. I have disabled Image Stabilization. I use a tripod. I set a 10 second timer to take shots. I keep the ISO at 80 to prevent graininess. I use manual focus. Basically all I want to do is take a shot from my veranda which shows a bank of about 15 buildings about 400/ 500 meters away stretched out across the horizon. In the background are dark mountains. In the foreground is a leafy park lit pleasantly in places by lights.I can't figure out how to get a decent shot. My old camera is a Panasonic Lumix DMC-ZR1...a simple point and shoot. It outperforms the Canon in these night time shots. With the Lumix, I set it up, set 'Starry Sky', select a 15second shutter speed, use the timer...it takes the photo and buildings are crisp, the sky is deep, the foreground is focused...everything is focused. The colours are rich.I've tried everything it seems (although I hope there is something simple I'm missing...) with the Canon...but the shots are smeared, slightly out of focus, bland and just awful.It's been suggested to me on the internet that in order to focus properly I should set wide angle to infinity focus then 'back off' a little from there. Also it's been suggested to choose a target in the shot and focus on it. But it's hard to select a specific target in a 2.7\" viewfinder that is 500 meters away...at night! It all looks kind of grainy in the live viewfinder. So how am I supposed to focus flawlessly on some feature 500 meters away? I thought that if I just set the widest angle that my DOF would be the biggest and pretty much everything would be focused.If anyone happens to read this review and has mastered night time cityscape shooting...please give me some feedback.One last thing....shots at night that are closer (for example, I took some shots of subjects/ structures much much closer than the 500 meters...like in a bus depot under lights at night etc) these shots came out way, way better. Could it be that the horrible pollution of HK is effecting my long range shots? Lately there has been a funk in the air you could cut through with a knife!But if that was the case........why does my little Lumix still take acceptable (and perfectly focused) shots in these conditions and the Canon does not?I am suspicious of the Canon's night abilities.Any thoughts anyone...anyone?EDIT: After reading a lot of advice on the net I have started to take a different approach. I am still in Manual mode for these night cityscape shots...but have decided to use auto focus more rather than the manual focus...pressing half way until the green box gives me the all clear. I was told that manual focus is virtually impossible to ascertain in a night fed grainy magnified LCD viewfinder...and I have to agree...especially when the subject is buildings 400 meters away. I also was always willing to accept user error here and at this stage I think I may have solved my problems...and that yeah, they are user error. Earlier I don't think I ever 'half-clicked' to secure the green focus box. When in auto focus mode earlier I think I just pointed and shot.  The smog is outrageous here at the moment so I'm not getting brilliant shots...but latest tests have given me much more satisfying focus. And that was my first hurdle. I'll continue to test the camera....I hope this disgusting smog clears up soon.", "Date": "January 25, 2011"}, {"Title": "Does Not Deliver", "Author": "rfr \"rfr\"", "ReviewID": "R2CE8XXASHOOHX", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "After six months with this camera, I am disappointed to the max.

The first of those was a huge mistake, on the advice of a friend I got a Point & Shoot Olympus which I managed to give to my brother in law and then went back to my favorite manufacturer. That was an SD400 and it served really well even though it's optical zoom really didn't zoom much and video was mono but it was great at concerts because it was so small, no security guard ever found it in my purse! Then, wanting better I moved on to the S5IS which took great photos & stereo video. This was in the days just before HD so it did produce 4:3 output but it was certainly good at it and the photos (with it's 12x optical zoom) were superb. For those times when only a DSLR will do I have the Rebel XSI and a couple of extra lenses and a SpeedLite flash unit (EX 300). Of course I got the last but one DSLR that doesn't do video but that's always the case. This year we ventured further and got the SD3500 for the small camera essential times and just before Black Friday I picked up the SX30IS at a real bargain. The real bugbear of the S5 as far as I was concerned was those 4 x AA batteries; even if you use rechargeables you always have to carry spares and carrying st least 8 in my purse created weight I didn't need. ALL the other Canons used small squarish gray units and a very compact recharged so my purse is now happy again. All the photos so far have been great & the HD video is even better. As with the S5, the strap could be thicker, like the one the Rebel uses, I find the thin one cuts into my neck. And FINALLY Canon seem to have solved the dreadful issue of the lens cap falling off usually as inappropriate moments! 35x optical zoom is awesome & I cannot wait to take it to concerts. Most venues now say cameras are OK but not professional. I've always gone by the rule that professional cameras are ones that have intercheable lenses (like the Rebel & Canon's wonderful but unaffordable for me) EOS range, so that gets it past security. I think most venues have decided that confiscating phones with cameras could be detrimental to their security guards' health (having several hundred iPhones/Smartphones to return to the right owners wouldn't be an easy task) so they are a little more forgiving to the venue patrons) so I can't wait for my next concert or day trip.", "Date": "January 4, 2011"}, {"Title": "This Cannon delivers a LOT for the money!", "Author": "Barb", "ReviewID": "R24DMKBPLPSI1S", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I got this camera instead of the Panasonic Lumix only because of the higher zoom capabilitity.

He said I might try using compressed air around the lens body to see if it would work.  No it didn't.  Well I will have to wait a couple weeks to send it in to see what happens.  I do know my new camera will be sitting at home unable to take the pictures I was hoping for.  I can at least borrow my old camera from my daughter so I will get some pictures.

If you ever seen an episode of Southpark that is exactly what you get. Every team player seemed like a Southpark 3D character in movement, there was a lot of \"jumping\" or \"skipping\" in the frames, just awful. As soon as I saw this I wasted no time and packed the camera to return it.  I made the decision and it was final.The camera has good features: a good zoom lens and focus option. But even for still pictures you will notice that curve figures are not smooth. For still pictures this camera is too expensive, you will be better with another option, the zoom lens does not justify its price considering the output it offers.I have a Canon A70 and I've been able to obtain better results.

So far, I love it.  I am an amateur and with no aspirations of being anything other than a mom taking pics of her kids.  I look for zoom because I like to avoid interrupting my kids playing but still snap good shots.  This camera definitely allows for that.  I have found though that it is harder to get a steady shot at high zoom than previous cameras I have owned.  But, the pic quality is SUPER clear.  My only complaint is that I cannot find the buttons or settings for using the mini, fisheye, color extraction or poster options that the features on the website (canon) boast...not in the manual that I saw, unless I overlooked, and I am not well versed enough in Canon's menus yet (having been a Kodak owner for the past several years) to figure it out :(  All in all, I am glad I returned my Kodak z981 and pre-ordered this one.

But I could have lived with that. What I found unacceptable was the software. Unless you install the Canon program you can't get any images into a modern Apple computer. Upon installing it I found it a nightmare. It's almost impossible to get an image file into iPhoto or iMovie. If you use an Apple, forget it.
