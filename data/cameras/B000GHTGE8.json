{"Reviews": [{"Title": "user friendly point & shoot; great quality + anti-shake", "Author": "LW", "ReviewID": "R9DAWPAH3HB7G", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I LOVE my little new toy.  I was debating to get this or Canon SD600, both in the same price range and same megapixel.  After doing a lot of research online and seeing the actual models in store, I decided to get this one and I am really glad I did.  What I really like about this camera so far:1. the optical image stabilization really works wonder!  at least for me who used to get a lot of fuzzy pix from my old fuji.  I was able to get a too-good-to-be-true pix of my cat yearning in motion!!  This may not work for everything (if there's a lot of jittering/shaking) but it sure works for what I was looking for (without compromising the quality).  One of the most common probs with compact cameras is jittering/shaking hands, and this certainly takes care that for you!2. GREAT battery life, which is what I really love and care about.  I was able to point and shoot over 100 pix so far (half of them with flash, though not consecutively) and plus some video clicks and still have full battery signal on.  It's amazing!  I also compared the battery life with the canon sd600 online.. it's about double according to some standard.3. Nice LCD.  For those of you who might be worried about missing the viewfinder on this toy, the battery life certainly makes up for it (plus the viewfinder usually doesn't get you 100% of the actual picture anyway).  Some review said that LCD playback quality is not as good, but I find no problem with it. (from a pair of non-prof/average eyes, that is)4. Very user-friendly.  I didn't really need to read manual to figure out most features of the camera.  I just got it on the hand for less than 2 days and I am already feeling like a pro with this camera.5. fast start-up and little shutter lag~  which is also important to me.6. a lot of features.  allow you to quickly change to different scene modes/effects.Some cons that I can think of:1. I think maybe some people will think brands like Canon has better image quality?  I don't have a new model Canon to compare with but with the previous models (in Canon & Fuji), I can't tell much difference.  (looks great to me for what I can tell)2. No optical viewfinder (for the people who really want to have viewfinder).3. the size of the camera is a little bigger than SD600 (and cannot compare to credit-card size casio Ex-Z60.  though this can be a pro & con depending on each individual's preference.  I have small/medium hands and the camera feels just fine (I was able to use one hand to navigate the bottoms/menu and to take pix).  But I can see probs with bigger hands4. the control bottoms are kind of small (which is typical in compact cameras).  Again, might be problematic with bigger hands.***Over all, for the price in this range, I think this is one of the best value on market right now that has a nice package of what typical people are looking for (user-friendly, long battery life, anti-shake, great/decent pix quality).  You usually have to pay for an extra $100 to get that optical stabilization feature in other model (i.e. Canon SD700).No camera is perfect but this camera has definitely come close to that!  I'd definitely recommend this for anyone.  I just hope the magic will last me for the years to come!  have to wait to see about that!", "Date": "November 26, 2006"}, {"Title": "Wonderful Options & Portability", "Author": "Patrick Sheldon", "ReviewID": "RMNY3T0UX3FGG", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This is the wife writing and you will be glad I said that as you read on.  I just purchased this camera a few weeks ago.  I had a Sony Cybershot camera which was stolen recently and this was what I chose to replace it.  I loved my cybershot, but it wasn't small enough to fit in certain purses I own.  This camera is the perfect size!  Not small enough to miss the buttons, but just right.  The image quality is wonderful and better then my old cybershot.  The screen is huge and the menu print is large and easy to read.  There are even icons in the menu that are a little animated.  It is VERY user-friendly and it has so many ways to customize your picture-taking!  It comes with the cables you need to connect it to your computer & your TV to have digital slide shows, you actually don't have to buy those seperate.  There is a setting for everything you can think of and it can take short amounts of video shots with audio.  I am very happy with it and I will definetly keep Panasonic in mind for future needs.  The zoom on the camera says it can go to 3x, but there is a setting in the menu for a digital zoom which can go all the way to 12x!  The image stabilization setting that Panasonic touts really does work.  It has been very very handy when you can't quite steady your hands.  The \"scene\" mode on the camera lets you chose from;  party, candle light, fireworks, starry sky, baby1, baby2, snow, high sensitivity, portrait, soft skin, scenery, sports, night portrait, night scenery, self portrait, food, and UNDERWATER. (There is a special case you can buy to take it diving with you!)  There are too many great things I could fill this space with about this camera so I will just say this - wonderful quality and worth every penny!", "Date": "December 6, 2006"}, {"Title": "very good for a digital camera", "Author": "IS", "ReviewID": "R3COKZNZMSPH0Z", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Very satisfied with this purchase. The best thing about this camera is its image stabilizer - it works magic. I was  shaking it as hard as I could while shooting and yet the shots are all in focus.

Most of the reviews are very accurate. The camera may not be much to look at, but it's a solid model. Photo quality is very good, and the image stabilization is very helpful indoors. The LCD screen is huge--2.5 inches--and despite that, the battery life is the best I have ever seen in a compact digital camera. I took quite a few good pictures today, mostly of puppies, and they came out very nicely. I really don't have any complaints with the camera, and the battery life is good enough I would bother buying an extra battery--which I usually do.

There is a setting that puts a year stamp on my daughter's pictures, the picture will say two-years and one-month ect.

We bought it back in 2006. Since then, it has seen the births of both of our children, got on trips, documented life via stills & movie with sound including of active children & animals. It takes absolutely beautiful pics & movies. A friend of ours is an electronics geek & was shocked when he was checking out my camera one day that the pictures it took were so much clearer & sharper than his more expensive, higher MP camera that he had been so confident of. :P I love the multiple photo options & usually use Baby1 & Baby2 modes as the pics are great & I instantly record the child's age at time of pic! It's even so easy to use, my 3-yr-old uses it & takes awesome, CLEAR pictures & movies! It's also held up astoundingly well over years of being dropped during daily life with kids.I recently damaged the lens (last month) as I accidentally knocked it over while it was on a tripod & it was turned on (so the lens was out). The lens is now loose & I must either try to get it repaired or get a new camera. I've been scouring the web to find one of this same model for a reasonable price. My hubby asked why I don't just get a brand new camera that's one of the newest models. My answer: this camera is perfect - why mess with that?

I can then record the images to CD and send the material on to clients for $1.77 as opposed to what the paper costs used to be to ship.  I also use this little gem when touring museums.
