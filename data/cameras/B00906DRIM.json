{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Great Camera, Poor HP Support", "Author": "Alun Whittaker \"AlunHW\"", "ReviewID": "R2Q7XHO7BRI5PD", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I bought this to be a \"happy-snapper\" to keep at my holiday home. It turned out to be a much better camera than that, and I now carry it with me all the time. Both the optics and software are as good, or maybe better than my many times more expensive Canon DSLRs.Other reviewers complained about the crowd of buttons and switches on the right hand side of the top and back of the camera. It's true that it takes a while learning how to hold the camera without unintentionally changing modes or even turning it off, but eventually even the congenitally clumsy like myself can learn the way.Only one thing keeps this from being a 5-star: even after downloading and reading the complete User's Manual from Hewlett Packard, I still had problems downloading pictures directly from the camera (i.e. downloading with the SD card installed in the camera, rather than popping out the SD card and downloading it directly). This section of the manual is skimpy and contains a couple of other obvious errors, so I concluded that the problem was not with the camera but the procedure.I contacted HP Technical Support by email, and received an automated response promising an answer in 24 hours. After a week with no further reply, I contacted the retailer who gave me a telephone number for HP technical support. I called that number and, after the usual long hold got an operator who gave me a different phone number to call. I called that number and, after a maze of robo-support options, reached another operator who told me that \"We don't support that camera!\".It is a good camera, I got it for a good price from this vendor, and both they and Amazon have treated me well over the years, so I'm going to keep it. But, if it ever goes wrong, I won't be expecting too much help from the manufacturer.", "Date": "April 22, 2013"}, {"Title": "Camera hp d3000", "Author": "karen velasquez", "ReviewID": "R32EBZ7SA5C1ZC", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "very excelent product. i like this camera, the resolution is perfect for my pictures, and the price very accesible finish", "Date": "September 9, 2013"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": "$159.95", "Features": null, "Name": "HP d3000 16MP 21x Optical/5x Digital Zoom 3.0\" LCD HD Camera", "ImgURL": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41XIpGhzxGL._SX300_.jpg", "ProductID": "B00906DRIM"}}
