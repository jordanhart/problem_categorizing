{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Great Camera!! first time Canon owner", "Author": "Stephanie", "ReviewID": "R2KQEPJQLAVNN3", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I am really impressed with the quality and style of this camera. Takes absolutely beautiful pictures and video, and has a wonderful LCD screen. I love all the different shooting options like selective color, kids/pets, super vivid, toy camera etc... Very easy to use/select what the best setting is for the situation you are shooting. This camera is very small and compact, but you can tell that it is made from sturdy, quality materials; even the wrist strap is very strong and durable. Takes beautiful, high quality HD video, and all you have to do is push the record button; no fidgeting with the settings or dials. Just an FYI, the Case Logic UNZB-2 cases are perfect for this camera, nice and snug! (I have the purple, but there are other colors.Case Logic UNZB-2 Compact Camera Case (Black) I would also recommend getting a decent memory card (if you are shooting HD video, you need a class 6 SDHC or above); i have the San disc hd extreme 16gb - the larger/better the memory card, the faster your camera will work SanDisk Extreme HD Video 16 GB SDHC Class 10 Memory Card (SDSDRX3-016G-A21)*IMPORTANT NOTE: I have heard that some Canon's of the same model are made in Japan, and some are made in China- the ones from China haveing significantly more problems than the ones from Japan. This camera is the model that is from Japan, just to clairify.", "Date": "December 9, 2011"}, {"Title": "Image Derringer", "Author": "J.J. Reich", "ReviewID": "R3U8RT3O91ONQO", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I purchased a 310HS for my daughter for Christmas 2011 for her to use during her semester abroad in equatorial Africa. It served her well in that harsh climate and she just loves it.For myself, I started with Canon in 1973 with a 35mm FTb-QL, and used an AE1-Program from 1983 until a thief helped himself to it about 10 years ago.  Since then, I toyed with an old style F-1, and I presently have a pair of sweet F-1Ns, a black AE1-Program, and a 20D.  In other words, my back is curved from all of the gear I have hauled over the years.In 2009, my family surprised me with a SD1200 ELPH, which I used for literally thousands of good shots. I have learned to live with less weight and bulk, with good results in terms of photos.  I carried the SD1200 with me almost every day (didn't want to miss any opportunities) until the still/video switch gave out in May.  Hence, the upgrade.I thought I would miss the optical viewfinder, but in retrospect I rarely used the one on my SD1200.  The 310HS does everything the SD1200 did, and it is pretty too.  The only hitch I have found so far is that its files may be too large to upload to Facebook - the Facebook upload program doesn't \"see\" them on my hard drive.  I am not sure that's the case, but I intend to explore.", "Date": "June 22, 2012"}, {"Title": "Elph number 5!", "Author": "john h bennett", "ReviewID": "R18G2TOMN0TS7Y", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This is our 5th Elph.  They are great......this one is no exception.  Each one has offered the current state of the art technology even slow learners could use.  This Elph, the 310 has great zoom capabilitiers, wonderful  video, and continued ease of use.  I was thrilled to find it in black, something the shops here in the East Coast claim is not made, on Amazon.  All in all a wonderful,compact camera that does more than any SLR from the 60-70-80-90-2000's that I have owned!", "Date": "December 15, 2011"}, {"Title": "Fabulous Little Camera", "Author": "Donna Rochford", "ReviewID": "R2I7VOPTK0NLT8", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This little camera takes gorgeous clear pictures with beautiful colors. Get so many compliments on the great pictures this camera takes. Love the higher 8x wide angle zoom feature & 3 inch screen which many pocket cameras don't have. Easily fits in a pocket or small purse. Great to carry for everyday pictures and was a wonderful backup to our bigger Canon 60D for quick shots on a recent trip to Italy. Very easy to use. I definitely recommend this little camera!", "Date": "December 28, 2012"}, {"Title": "Small and very usefull", "Author": "Richard A. Carlstrom", "ReviewID": "RDVTXVCOQXORH", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This is a cool little camera. Packed with all kinds of useful features and relatively easy to master even though the menu system is a little bit cumbersome. I don't take all that many pictures so the battery charge lasts me for a long time. It swings into action quickly and shuts down quickly also. Nice and small but feels very solid.", "Date": "December 19, 2012"}, {"Title": "Canon PowerShot ELPH 310", "Author": "L.
