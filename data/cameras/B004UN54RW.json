{"Reviews": [{"Title": "I feel duped This is not a Canon kit", "Author": "Rated", "ReviewID": "R4LF4YFJGN9D2", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "The only things in this Kit that are made by Canon are the camera,charger and lenses. The entire rest of the kit is off brand stuff that is considerably lesser quality. The tripod is useless since it won't lay flat.You can take crooked pics with it I guess but it is not sturdy enough to be trusted with this camera by me.The flash shown in the pic is pretty descent flash.THIS IS NOT THE ONE YOU WILL GET!You will receive the cheapest POS I have ever seen by agfa.Maybe a ten dollar flash and mine has scratches all over it like it was used. I recieved a bottom hot shoe mount that is OBVIOUSLY used due to the stripped threads and teeth marks in the metal.There is also some rust in the threads hole.The camera bag you will recieve will not fit anywhere close to the amount of stuff that is in the kit let alone any extra and is NOT a CANON bag.I really feel duped by this seller and the bait and switch tactic in his ad. I assumed this was a Canon kit since there are no ther MFGs referenced.Do yourself a favor and do some more research on sellers.There are more non Canon items than Canon items in this kit.Unfortunately I need the camera next week so I cannot return the whole darn lot and start over.I ran out today to get a tripod that will work.I can't really afford to replace the bag and flash right now so I am in a bad position.I spent my money on an STM lense to go with camera which is the only way you use the continuous auto focus feature.You cannot use it the way this kit comes.", "Date": "July 7, 2012"}, {"Title": "Best camera you ever get for the money", "Author": "Anthony D.

However it is great for a beginner who may not have the finances to purchase higher end lens and other items. The Tripod is NOT GOOD. It is very flimsy and I will not place my equipment on it. The Tri-Pod will work great on the smaller compact cameras. I have used the various lenses and filters and noticed good results.
