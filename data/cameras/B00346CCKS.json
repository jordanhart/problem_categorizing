A book or video detailing this camera would have been more beneficial than the jump start video that came with the accessory kit. It was too elementary. Also, the card reader that came with the kit didnot fit my compactflash. I emailed twice only to receive the same \"wrong\" card reader.Also, it my be a coincidence, but I have been unindated with junk mail since I placed my order for the camera. Did you trade or sell my email account?", "Date": "February 16, 2012"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": "$1,179.00", "Features": null, "Name": "Canon EOS 7D 18 MP CMOS Digital SLR Camera with 3-inch LCD (Body) + 16GB Deluxe Accessory Kit", "ImgURL": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51OpQABvslL._SY300_.jpg", "ProductID": "B00346CCKS"}}
