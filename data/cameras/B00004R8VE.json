{"Reviews": [{"Title": "One camera that does it all", "Author": "\"wavshrdr\"", "ReviewID": "R3GQPNKDBPE5G", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I had the predecessor to this camera the 2020Z.  Great camera but I wanted audio capability.  Everything I liked about the 2020Z is here and more.  Its still compact (fits in pockets better than most), EASY on batteries,  excellent colors, fast lens (2020Z is faster), fast shot recovery, wireless  remote and very light weight.  The 3030Z expands on the 2020Z with one  lever zoom for both optical and digital modes, higher resolution (won't  gain you much on average size pictures), more control over power off and on  settings.  Some things that I do miss about the 2020Z are it's faster lens  and the ability to shot 30 frames per second in low resolution movie mode.  You do have a large memory buffer on the 3030Z so you can shoot 5 frames in  best resolution mode in a little over a second!  While no camera can yet do  it all this one comes very close.  I currently have an Olympus 2500L, 500L,  2020Z and Nikon Coolpix 950 and this is my favorite by far.  The only  things I would change on the 3030Z are: an incredibly close macro mode like  the 950/990 Nikon, standard NiMH batteries and charger like my 2020Z,  faster lens of the 2020Z (one of the fastest on a digital), 30 fps in all  movie modes as well as optical instead of digital zoom with movies and the  nifty little exposure histogram like on the high-end Nikons.  Those minor  quibbles aside it is an outstanding camera.  It doesn't eat batteries,  takes great pictures (not just great digital pictures) and is very fast  between shots and from the time your press the shutter to the shot is  actually taken.  If you have used a Kodak 280 or 290 you know how  aggravating it is to press the shutter and wait...wait... wait... until you  finally lose the once in a lifetime shot you actually wanted to take.It  is tough to go wrong if you buy this camera.  It is not cheap but it is an  excellent value.  The \"boot up\" time of the camera is really quick too. If  you are willing to trade off a slightly smaller memory buffer for burst  mode and slightly less recording time in movies as well the Olympus 3000Z  is a good choice and you will save about $200.  One big plus often  overlooked is the software that comes bundled with the camera.  The  software included with the Nikon's is basic at best.  If you buy the 3030Z  you get Adobe Photoshop 5 LE which is an outstanding program that gives you  a lot of control over editing your images.  It may be the \"light\" version  of Photoshop but it is still incredibly powerful. This does NOT come with  the 3000Z though!  I think that is part of the pricing difference between  the two.  One other big plus about the Olmpus \"C\" series in general is that  you rarely get \"red eye\" when using the built in flash.  I can't seem to  avoid it on my Nikon 950 and my friend has the same problem on his Nikon  990.  The 3030Z does a great job in low light conditions without the flash  too.  Buy one, it's a great camera!", "Date": "June 10, 2000"}, {"Title": "IMPRESSED!", "Author": "Andre L. Aragon", "ReviewID": "R2NQEAVINA1H02", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Being a tech geek, I did a bit of research on the various websites and narrowed my choices between the Olympus 3030 and Nikon 9090.  It seemed to be a toss up depending on which features you valued most.  I chose the Olympus for a variety of reasons and haven't regretted my decision.  First of all, the picture quality exceeded my expectations from the very first picture.  I've taken a variety of shots from the different settings and even with the \"avereage\" quality setting of images, the detail the camera picked up is unbelievable.  I've even zoomed in on the images with various photo editing programs and still can't detect any distortion.  Secondly, the installation of the provided software was a easy.  A nice bonus to the software was the supplying of Adobe Photoshop 5.0 LE, a slimmed down version of the very popular photo editing program that sets the industry standard for professional photo editing.  Third, Olympus provided a USB cable for downloading images from the camera to the PC, which speeds up the process tremendously when comparing it to a Serial transfer.  The few complaints I have concern more of the decisions of Olympus for what they provided instead of the overall quality of the camera.  First, why in the heck didn't they provide a charger and rechargable batteries?  Sure, they upgraded to Lithium batteries but this camera eats a lot of juice when using the LCD monitor.  And how about providing an AC adaptor for those times we want to download all our images or use the camera indoors.  Second, I had to go out and purchase a little lens cap strap since the cap isn't connected to the camera.  Having to place the cap in and out of my pocket when I want to take pictures is asking for the cap to be lost (especially when making the family trips to Disneyland).Finally, the Olympus also uses the Smartmedia data storage and provides you with a 16MB card.  This isn't bad depending on what setting you have your camera on (the higher the quality, the less pictures you can take) but I would consider purchasing an additional memory card with a higher capacity.  As of this date, I believe the highest amount of MB that Smartmedia makes is 64Mb.  I know the Nikon uses the Compact Flash system and can go a as high as 128MB.  That's a feature to consider (well, the cost for a 128MB Compact Flash card runs on average is about $300).", "Date": "December 8, 2000"}, {"Title": "Default Settings, Etc.", "Author": "Amazon Customer", "ReviewID": "R2Y5G600KZEZRR", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This is a very nice camera.  I agree with Jim DuLaney on the  shutter delay of digital cameras.  I am use to the release on my Canon F-1 and A-1.  However, you can shoot again while the camera is still recording the image to the SmartMedia Card.PLEASE NOTE:  \"Slopedirk\" (see his review) must not have used the owner's manual.  You most certainly can set your own default settings, such as your preferred resolution; whether you want flash or no flash; shutter priority or aperture priority, and the preferred setting; etc.The menu selections are fairly simple once you play with the camera awhile.  As for the problem of taking the lens cap off before turning on the power - buy the extender tube (an Olympus accessory).  This tube is needed if you attach accessory lenses.  I find it very useful because it allows me to use a filter (Haze, UV, Skylight, etc.).  I leave it on at all times!A good companion book for any digital camera: Digital Photography For Dummies\u00ae, by Julie Adair(find it at [amazon])...

In the end, I choose the Olympus because of the option of sound on the movie feature. (I bought the camera to take pictures of a new addition to the family.) I really like how easy it is to take basic pictures. Family picture takers will like this camera. It takes great pictures, easy to transfer using USB, and comes bundled with great software. The camera is also very compact - its about the size of an average point and shoot.The only thing that I would change about the camera is making the menu system more accessible. It is relatively easy to use, but I have not mastered making quick changes yet. A great addition would be a quick menu system in the top LCD area instead of having to power up the monitor. Or a button to quickly shift between some saved modes. You will also need to read the manual in order to really understand some of the features. They are not that intuitive for a Nikon SLR user...If you are buying this camera, you should also get extra memory and batteries.

The surprise is how fast the manual reads and how simple to follow the instructions are!  Who knew?

I can override the  shutter speed, the aperture or both and get the same effects as with my old  manual Nikon -- and do it in color, sepia, or black and white.  What's  more, the flash is versitile and easy to switch off for ambient light work  -- and even the fully automatic settings turn out some fine exposures.  It self corrects for florescent, tungsten, shade or sun -- it zooms  tight for close ups without requiring lots of extra lens purchases up front  -- it gives me enough flexibility in dpi / resolution that I can shoot 40  or 300 frames on a single disk -- and it's easy to download into my little  Mac iBook thanks to the included software -- it does everything I would  have on my wish list if I were making up this camera myself....No  problems.

Windows 95 users will need to purchase a floppy disc adapter for the smart media card in order to download pictures to a PC. A Serial Port Cable also works with Windows95. I had a Sony FD-91 Mavaca Digital before I bought this Olympus and the C-3030 has the Mavaca beat hands down.

It allows for many pixel  compressions of jpeg files, all of which are fine quality.  In the 1st 3  weeks, I have taken over 1,000 photos of nature, travel, people, and  objects.  It uses smartcards which are smaller than a matchbook cover and  the 32 meg smartcard allows 330 photos on the SQ2 down to 40 on the HQ  compression. I print on a Hewlett-Packard Office Jet 60R and the quality is  very close to 35mm enlargements from a color lab. I recommend using the  rechargeable batteries since they last many hours then take a quick  recharge. I intend to use this camera to photograph mushrooms in our  forests this August and have total confidence in it. The macro button  allows the lens to be within inches of the subject, and with both manual  and digital zoom enabled, the subject fills the view.  The lens is fast  enough to use in dim light, but the flash is there when you need it.  The  accompanying software is easy to install, easy to use.Caveats: it is  very complex and the accompanying manual is essential. I refer to the  manual daily.  Also, I find it hard to get accustomed to the shutter delay  of a digital cameras after using a Canon A-1 SLR for all these years.  I  should mention that  the 1 1/2 inch LCD monitor cannot be seen when in  direct sunlight, although is perfectly visible when in shadows.

With it, I've taken great shots of daily scenes in and around Miami, FL.  Having it makes street photography fun and easy.As for the C3030's image quality, no other digital camera, in its price range, outdoes it. I went from a One Megapixel camera straight to the C3030.  Needless to say, the difference was astounding.  The large number of resolutions from which to choose really allow the photographer to shoot for any purpose--from email attachments, to Web pages, to professionally output hi-res images.  Usually, simply using the default resolution with the built in picture taking modes is right for any situation not requiring super hi-res output.  And it's easy.I coupled my Olympus with an HP DeskJet 1220C.  Using the camera's default resolution, the printed output is guite good.  I can tell I haven't used the higher resolutions.  But my friends, who see the framed photos, usually think they came from a lab.Of course I use Photoshop to help tweak the images until they look just as I want them to look.

I have been a casual photographer for many years and finally took the digital plunge - the C3030 outstrips the performance of my 35 mm SLR, and after much research, I concluded it outperforms most digital cameras as well.  I also read some of the previous reviews, and most of the negative \"problems\" people listed either weren't problems of the camera or were because the person didn't know how to use the camera. When it comes right down to it, picture quality is what makes or breaks a digital camera.  The C3030 sweeps the field.  Color quality and sharpness exceeds my 35 mm.  I took a face portrait of my son and blew it up to just his eyeball - you could count the tiny veins in his eye.  You can easily blow up pictures beyond 8 x 10 and still have sharp pictures.  It does a better job reproducing sharp, realistic colors than most Kodak film.  Low light capability is very good (even better with the new C3040 with its 1.8 lens).  The menu is easily navigated (although it will take a little study of the manual; the camera has a lot of capability) and the controls are, for the most part, very easy to use.  The camera is nicely programmable for those who want to venture there.  The memory-buffered multi-picture capability (like a fast motor drive in an SLR) is very handy for action shots.  The camera is extremely compact considering its capability and can be carried easily.  When taking pictures, it is very comfortable and natural to hold, unlike many other digital cameras. The USB transfer rate is much better than a serial cable but I took it a step further and bought an inexpensive Smart Media PC card adaptor.  I pop the card out of the camera and into the PC slot and it is a near instant download of 128 MB of pictures! (I purchased the 128 MB card and it holds a huge number of pictures). It uses up batteries, but no more than other digital cameras.  I purchased 1400mah NiMH batteries and travel charger for only $38 - it works great and lasts a reasonable amount of time; hasn't been a problem. I have taken many hundreds of pictures, perhaps thousands, without a single glitch.  One of my few complaints is the flash performance, but the camera takes such great pictures without the flash, especially with a tripod, I mostly don't use it.  Again, the new C3040 may take this even one step further.  I also wish the Macro performance was better (closer) but it has been acceptable for most applications.

Without  reading the manual it took me no time at all to install 4 AA batteries and  I had the camera up and running immediately without a hitch - or breaking  anything.  There was nothing wrong with my remote control or the battery,  and camera view finder works as it should.  The one very minor flaw is that  if you power up the camera with the lens cap over the lens, the zoom lens  tries to push outward causing the a grinding sound.  Its happend to me a  couple times but didn't cause any damage and I'm more careful now to take  the lens cap off before powering up the camera.  This camera is awesome!

A knob would be a  much better way to handle this and some other settings.  I also personally  am a retro guy and would lose the motorized stuff, a nice lever would  suffice and save the batteries.

It works well with the Viking 128MB chip (other than inability to do panorama, not much of a drawback for me) and right out of the box I was able to quickly be pointing and shooting. This is my second digital camera, and I am very impressed with it. The LCD menus are a little tricky to navigate at first, but I am quickly learning where things are. I have experimented with taking pictures at different resolutions and qualities, and also shot some movie clips. I downloaded the results to my computer with little trouble, although I think I would recommend buying either a reader or a PCMCIA adapter for the memory chip, downloading from the camera over it's USB port to the hard drive is a little cumbersome. It takes very nice photos in average lighting without the need for the flash, and I find it very easy to quickly snap a picture, especially of quickly moving subjects like children. It took me a little reading of the manual to discover that the remote only works when the timer is enabled, however once I mastered it I like the 3 second delay so you can hide the remote. I like the ergonomic placement of the controls, I can both hold the camera and work its major functions with a single hand. I didn't see any mention in the manual of the fact that the lens cap has to be removed prior to turning it since the first thing it tries to do is extend the lens barrel. Perhaps the lens cap should snap onto the extensible barrel and not the external housing? These are not major drawbacks but things to bear in mind while learning to use this camera. As a prior user of a digital camera, I think Olympus has done a good job addressing some of the shortcomings of early digital cameras, plus creating a digital camera that looks and feels like the film cameras I have used for years. The touch of the shutter button, picture resolution and recording speed are vastly superior to what I am used to in a digital camera, and compare with a good SLR. All the additional features are there if I want them, but the solid performance of the basic function is a key ingredient.

Manual settings are easy to adjust, but the auto setting mode is dead-on except for difficult shots like those with backlighting.  The video mode also works great and captures both video and sound for short periods (200 seconds on a 64 mb card at HQ resolution).  This is a great camera and the price is also great.

This has been a fantastic camera both in terms of quality, reliability and battery life.  Between some friends and myself we have just about every model in this family (C-2000 through C-3040) and we all love our cameras.Quality: I have taken hundreds of shots, mostly outdoor.  I tend to shoot at the high-quality jpeg level so I bought a 64MB smart media card.  Paired with my HP DeskJet 952 I regularly printout 4x6 prints on photo paper that are absolutely perfect.  I have printed a few 8x10 pictures and they are fantastic.  No one can believe they were taken with a digital camera.  I have to zoom in quite a ways with my photo editing software before I can see any pixels.  The only negative thing I can say is that I wish it had a better macro mode.Reliability: It has been rained on, splashed by a wave, and dropped a short distance onto a rock.  Despite all this it is still going strong a year and several hundred pictures later with no negative affects.Batteries: I use the rechargeable batteries and during heavy use they last 2-3 weeks.  During light use they last 3-6 months.  Compare this to most Kodak or Nikon cameras that last a few days of heavy use.A few comments on my accessories: Forget the 16MB card that comes with it.

It is also larger than most current consumer-targeted 35mm and APS cameras.  It is not as large as a 35mm SLR camera however.The lense cap on this camera does not have a strap.  This is a problem that is compounded by the fact that the lense cap falls off relatively easily when pressure is applied to it.  A replacement cap with a strap can be purchased from Olympus. My only other comment is that the camera delays a split-second or so after pressing the shutter button before the image is taken.  This makes the camera very impractical for shooting anything in which a lot of action is involved.  You will likely miss the shot you intended to take.  I do not regularly take these types of pictures, however, so it isn't much of an issue.Overall, I really like the camera.

This has been a fantastic camera both in terms of quality, reliability and battery life.  Between some friends and myself we have just about every model in this family (C-2000 through C-3040) and we all love our cameras.Quality: I have taken hundreds of shots, mostly outdoor.  I tend to shoot at the high-quality jpeg level so I bought a 64MB smart media card.  Paired with my HP DeskJet 952 I regularly printout 4x6 prints on photo paper that are absolutely perfect.  I have printed a few 8x10 pictures and they are fantastic.  No one can believe they were taken with a digital camera.  I have to zoom in quite a ways with my photo editing software before I can see any pixels.  The only negative thing I can say is that I wish it had a better macro mode.Reliability: It has been rained on, splashed by a wave, and dropped a short distance onto a rock.  Despite all this it is still going strong a year and several hundred pictures later with no negative affects.Batteries: I use the rechargeable batteries and during heavy use they last 2-3 weeks.  During light use they last 3-6 months.  Compare this to most Kodak or Nikon cameras that last a few days of heavy use.A few comments on my accessories: Forget the 16MB card that comes with it.  I keep only mine as a back up.  You will want a 64 MB smart media card.I bought the Olympus T-CON14 tele-converter lens 1.45x (152mm equivalent) and I am very happy with it.  It can retail up to $200 but I shopped around on-line.  My next purchase is the wide-angle lens.I bought the Olympus Accessory Kit (which is the same for C-2000 through C-3040 models), mostly for the UV filter, adapter tube and 43mm-55mm step-up ring, and AC adapter.  I bought it for about $95, which is close to what all those things cost separate.  The mini-tripod, software, and case that come in that kit are not overly impressive but I considered those `free'.

All are great products.  After  extensive research, I decided on the Olympus C-3030Z.I suppose the  primary thing to look for in any camera, analog or digital, is image  quality.  In this regard, all of these cameras score very well.  People  seem to say that the Sony produces the sharpest pictures with the most  vivid -- but not necessarily most accurate -- color; the Canon's images are  good but tend to be on the \"cool\" side; and the Nikon and Olympus  are said to produce the most balanced and \"accurate\" images.  It  is hard to say which camera takes the \"best\" pictures: some  people prefer the razor-sharp look of the Sony images, while others find  the Olympus and Nikon images much more pleasing -- it's all a matter of  taste.  But basically, you are going to get superb pictures from any of  these cameras.  Personally, I thought the Olympus and Nikon produced the  most natural-looking and visually appealing images.Image quality aside,  there are basically 3 reasons I chose the Olympus.  FIRST, it has a solid,  rugged feel and its black aluminum body fits naturally into your hand.  (The Coolpix's twist body is, well, cool -- but I found it awkward to hold,  and the Olympus is more compact.)  SECOND, the Olympus uses the tiny  \"SmartMedia\" flash memory card, which I prefer, simply because I  have another device that uses the same format.  (The Sony uses its  proprietary \"Memory Stick\"; the Nikon uses CompactFlash Type I;  and the Canon takes CompactFlash Type I/II, I think.)  THIRD, the Olympus  provides a large number of image resolution storage modes -- you can choose  any combination of picture size (2048x1536, 1600x1200, 1280x960,1024x768,  640x480) and compression level (uncompressed TIFF, jpeg high quality, jpeg  normal), for a total of 15 different combinations.  This flexibility  enables you to choose the resolution/compression appropriate to your  particular intended use of the images.  (By the way, you can fit about 20  images at 2048x1536, normal jpeg compression onto the supplied 16MB  SmartMedia card.)  FOURTH, the Olympus is very fast: quick power-up, very  little shutter \"lag\", and large memory buffer that makes a  \"burst\" or sequence mode possible.  FIFTH, the camera allows you  to make short (up to 3 minutes) movies, with audio.I've had the camera  for about a week now, and I love it.  The pictures are astonishingly good,  and the camera has an intuitive menu system that makes it easy to use.  The  USB connection is a snap, although I use a SmartMedia card reader to  download pix to my computer.  A nice touch: the camera comes with an A/V  cable and a little wireless remote so you can hook it up to your TV, gather  everyone around and gawk at the pictures you just took!All in all, I  feel I made the right choice with the Olympus.  My only criticisms: Olympus  should package this camera with rechargeable NiMH batteries, not the  lithium disposables it comes with; the LCD screen has a bit of a glare  problem in the outdoors; and the optical zoom isn't integrated with the  digital zoom (i.e., the camera doesn't automatically transition to digital  zoom when optical zoom \"runs out\") -- you have to access a menu  to switch from one to the other.  But these are very minor gripes.  I  recommend the Olympus C-3030Z without hesitation!", "Date": "July 12, 2000"}, {"Title": "Good Digital Output, but comprises in Controls.", "Author": null, "ReviewID": "R2DBQS5D1I4LNQ", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "I have used this camera for one of my model shoots.

Now this is something, the 135mm, nor i think the medium format can give. BTW, I used the SHQ format, which gives me abt 27 pic, on a 64 MB disk.However, MANY problems were encountered when we were trying to retrieve the pics from the disk. We had specially bought a cable for the transfer of info, but, it seems that, the disk, or the cable is not very stable. Well, You might like me, get many problems when trying to get the pic out from the disk.Such that even when we try to download the pic from the camera, it kept hanging.But the abovementioned problem is or might be a problem with the PC, or (i suspect) the disk, of which i had three, the 16 MB, 32 MB, and 64MB one.another shortcoming of the camera is the inabilty to switch off the flash feature. As during the shoot, when i try to take my model in low light situations, there is NO way i could turn the flash off, as it does not come with that feature, as it is either  in Flash mode or hotshoe to the lightings flash.But overall, it gives gd results for a casual photographer.", "Date": "January 8, 2001"}, {"Title": "I'm only semi-impressed, but I've just gotten the camera.", "Author": "George Wu \"codejanitor\"", "ReviewID": "RQUKV1K8KTJ22", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "I've just gotten the camera, and only taken ten or so pictures.

With small children, that delay is somewhat irritating.Also, the USB drivers do not work with Windows 95.

Reading the reviews this is a general problem for all Olympus cameras except the E-10. Olympus does not intend to fix this.

The camera looks and feels cheap. There is a small motor inside that control the lens. It kept grinding like a McDonald's give away toy car. The second thing that one notices when tries to shoot a picture is the extremely poor optical quality of the optical viewfinder. I have seen better quality optical viewfinders in disposable film cameras. The Olympus spents quite a lot of effort to warn the buyer that the optical viewfinder is misaligned with respect to the actual picture taken but makes no mention of the optical quality problems.Reading the camera manual the new buyer will be \"thriled\" to learn directly from OLYMPUS that the camera TFT screen and the the LCD displays have \"limited life\". The note in the manual further warns the buyer to expect that the screen will eventualy start flickering and getting darker. So if your camera starts flickering after the warranty runs out be prepared for an expensive repair bill. It would have been nice if Olympus had put a longer lasting screen instead of warning of the shody quality of the components on the last pages of the operator's manual. If you plan to use this camera for more than a week in a field environment buy another camera. The operating specification limits in the manual specify operating and storing condition of the camera to 90% humidity.
