{"Reviews": [{"Title": "L100 - Great Camera All Around, Especially for Beginners", "Author": "WheresTheGym? \"Explorer\"", "ReviewID": "R2SDRXEBLGNJMB", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "After extensive research on advanced point-and-shoots that use AA batteries (something I require), I settled on three: the Nikon L100, the Canon Powershot SX10IS, and the Fujifilm s8100fd. So you know the perspective from which this review is coming, I'm not an experienced photographer but I'm not clueless either.  However, this is my first camera more advanced than a basic point-and-shoot.  So I'll call myself an informed beginner.This is why I chose the L100:COST: The L100 is significantly less expensive than the SX10IS.  The s8100fd's price was comparable to the L100, but I felt that the technology on the L100 was better.  Amazon had the best price I could find (besides some sketchy online sellers).TECHNOLOGY:  This was a toughy.  All three of these cameras have comparable technology (image stabilization, zoom, megapixels, face recognition, scene modes, etc. etc.) and each has one or two unique features that I found very attractive.  So this variable was not a deal maker or breaker for me.  But when it came down to it, the L100 is the most beginner-friendly of the three cameras.  The Auto Modes do literally everything for you: the camera chooses the shutter speed, ISO, aperture, no flash or one of a number of flash modes, AND scene mode, which neither of the other cameras do.  So from bright- to low- light situations and from various distances, it will automatically adjust more aspects of the shot than will the other cameras.  This, I think, would be especially attractive to the minimally experienced photographer who just wants to click the button wherever they are and come out with great pictures.WEIGHT AND SIZE: I handled a Canon Powershot SX10IS at the store and it was just too heavy for my liking (a common complaint, from what I've read).  The L100 is very lightweight. Although the s8100fd is of similar weight, the L100 is slightly smaller in size, which I like.LARGER SCREEN: The 3 inch LCD is bigger than the screens on the other cameras, it's very bright, and it has a coating that reduces glare.After playing around with the camera for a few days, here are some additional observations/impressions:MENU: The menu is very user-friendly and easily navigable.  No problems there. Take ten minutes to read through the manual so you are aware of all the menu options.DESIGN AND FEEL: It's not a slippery camera, which seems to be a complaint with some of the comparable cameras I've read reviews about.  The buttons seem intuitively placed to me, and the camera feels balanced in my hand.IMAGE STABILIZATION: This works very well.  As long as you are in the right mode (read the manual for descriptions of situations you should choose the modes yourself) the camera takes completely focused and clear pictures, even with an unsteady hand.BATTERIES and MEMORY CARD: The battery life on this camera is good: 900 shots with Li-Ion batteries.  Some people don't like the SD card to be accessible in the same door as the batteries (like it is with this camera), but I don't find a problem with it.  I bought an Ultra II SDHC card for the camera and it processes the pictures very quickly.MOVIE MODE: You can zoom 2x while shooting video, which is nice.OTHER FEATURES I LIKED:  The Best Shot Selector is a unique feature that I like.  It's just another one of those very beginner-friendly features of this camera that will allow you to take great shots without having to do a lot. The Sports continuous-shooting mode (shooting 13 frames per second) also works well for action shots.TAKING PICTURES: Like I mentioned before, I'm not an experienced photographer.  But I found that out of the box in the \"Easy-Auto\" Mode, this camera takes focused, sharp, professional-looking pictures. As I started to play around with other features, I became even more impressed with the quality of the pictures in a variety of lighting, distance, and movement situations.  The High ISO mode captures movement VERY well! I first tested it by waving my arm in the mirror as fast as I could and taking pictures, and the camera captured perfectly focused and crisp pictures of me. This is the first camera I've ever used that actually captures excellent movement shots.  Even at maximum zoom, the shots are focused and look great. The flash is extremely bright, although I find I rarely need to use it.The only complaint that I have at this point is that the camera has trouble focusing on objects in dim light, including close objects in Macro Mode. However, from the dozens of reviews I've read on other comparable cameras, this seems to be a common problem.  It's also possible that I haven't played around with the camera enough to know how to circumvent the problem, but I still was a little disappointed.OVERALL:  This camera is inexpensive for it's class, lightweight, has the latest technology, and is extremely beginner- and user-friendly. It is the perfect camera for someone who wants something more than a basic point-and-shoot but doesn't want to spend the money on an SLR or the energy trying to figure out a more complex camera to get great shots. For those beginner to moderately skilled photographers debating between an advanced point-and-shoot and a SLR (like I initially did), you will be glad you got this over an expensive and bulky SLR.  A SLR with a 15x+ telephoto lens will cost 3-4 times as much as this camera, and I'm very pleased with the quality of the photos I'm getting with the L100.  The Easy-Auto and Auto modes are excellent and I think most people will be very happy with the shots they will produce while in them, even if they never leave those modes. However, learning all of the features is easy and hasn't taken me that long, and my pictures have looked more and more professional the more I've played around with them. This is a great camera.PS-I got the M-Rock Ozark 505 case for this camera and it fits it perfectly----------------------------Here is a video collage of pictures I took with this camera in Namibia - [...]", "Date": "March 30, 2009"}, {"Title": "Great camera for long-distance shots!", "Author": "Nikki S.", "ReviewID": "R2HILE52L2QW3A", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I primarily purchased this camera because I love my smaller Nikon Coolpix 7600 but wanted something with more zoom.  I've only had this camera for about a week, but its great so far!I do see the \"focusing problem\" someone was talking about, but its not really a problem...Its just that you can't zoom in too closely on something if you are standing close to it - I think this is because of the lens type - its for long distances.  But if you choose the macro setting specifically for close-ups, this can also be avoided.When I first got the camera and took it out of the box, I immediately started taking pictures and they weren't coming out so good, but this was because I didn't know how to make the flash work - you have to raise it by hand - a quick check of the manual revealed this, but I was too anxious in the beginning to stop and read the manual. ;-)Also, I had trouble getting used to choosing the different scene settings becuase it doesn't have a dial like my old Coolpix did.  Then I realized this is a GOOD thing, because the dial would constantly get turned when I didn't realize it and be on the wrong setting when I took a picture.If you are an expert photographer and want the control of an SLR, this is not something you will like, but for amateurs or people who just want more zoom than a small camera offers - this is a really good choice.  It is not as bulky as an SLR and you don't have to worry about changing lenses.Be aware that the manual says this camera cannot be used with rechargable batteries.", "Date": "May 17, 2009"}, {"Title": "It DOES use a rechargeable battery!", "Author": "boysinbooks", "ReviewID": "R3NBUKFHJND3FW", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I thought I would emphasize the rechargeable battery since Nikon just added it recently and some reviewers were saying the L100 couldn't use a rechargeable battery. It's a NI-MH battery with recharger. Check the NIKON webpage for the L100 and you will see it listed under \"optional accessories\". Personally, I don't like rechargeables because they lose their charge over time and you have to remember to recharge them when you get ready to use your camera. I'd much rather just pop in a set of alkaline AA's. Then battery cost is about a penny a pic. I can afford that.Here are the reasons I bought this camera. I use it to do stop-motion shooting in the woods using toy action figures, also on a copy stand to copy greaseboard drawings for animation, and just for general photo shooting. This camera helps because:(1) It has a flat bottom and with a triangular footprint which means it will not fall over when you set it down. No tripod needed. I put a flat piece of wood between it and the ground to protect it.(2) The 15X Zoom lens widens all the way out to 5mm which is equivalent to a 28mm lens on a 35mm camera. Most digicams only go down to about 6mm or 5.7mm on the wide end. (The 75mm telephoto end of the zoom is about as powerful as you can have and still keep steady with a handheld shot. This camera has a double system of vibration control to help avoid blurred shots.)(3) The scene modes include one called \"Food\" mode which is very useful to me. It automatically switches to macro close-up lens and puts control of color balance on the arrow buttons where you can easily adjust it. Then, whatever color balance you set stays in memory (just for the Food mode) until the next time you use Food mode, even if you turn the power off. That's important for stop motion because you don't want the camera automatically resetting the color balance for each shot. Obviously the Food mode is intended for close-up shooting of food, but it works for me and my toys!(4) There is an AC adapter for the camera, which I have ordered, so I will not be using any batteries for my in-the-studio shooting.(5) NIKON quality. I tried this camera in the store and couldn't even hear the zoom operate. By contrast, a similar-priced CANON made a distinct grinding noise. The quality even extends to the 4 manuals - a 134 page main manual in English, a 20 page Quickstart manual in English, and then both manuals completely duplicated in Spanish as well. The manuals cover every feature in clear detail. It took me 2 hours to learn the camera features to my own satisfaction, BUT, there is an \"EASY AUTO\" mode that requires you to know nothing from the manual other than how to push a shutter button. Of course, maybe you should buy a simpler camera if that's all you want from your camera, but with the \"EASY AUTO\" mode you can share this camera with all family members, even the ones who don't want to know what color balance is.(6) Maybe I am thinking illogically, but I believe that a big lens takes better pictures than a little lens... and this camera has a BIG lens. That means you can't slip it in your pocket, but I have a nifty little belt-loop case (the Edit 100) that neatly fits the camera and has pockets for 2 sets of 4 AA batteries and room for the SD memory card's case and maybe a few more small items.To sum it up, the quality is high, the price is low, and it takes great pictures in a variety of situations with an easy-ro-use operating system. If you want more than that, then get a reflex camera and pretend you're a pro. :)", "Date": "June 17, 2009"}, {"Title": "We like this camera", "Author": "Ukrgirl", "ReviewID": "R1BNO49FL5N178", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "We've had this camera for a month now. Absolutely no problems with it. We do have Trascend memory card in it--works great. No focusing problem either.I have researched a lot of Cannon Powershots ELPHS and such but decided to go with this one. It is very easy to use. Very user friendly menu. Takes great pictures with an amazing zoom. Colors are wonderful. I was very worried that I would have a problem without a viewfinder. Well, the 3'' LCD is truly great--I was taking pictures at the beach, in the middle of the day, and still was able to see the screen. I was also concerned about having to raise the flash manually, since I am not a pro at all. I realized that being able to do that is actually a great advantage for every day pictures. It makes a huge difference when taking pictures inside. I had problems with flash going off automatically with my Sony Cybershots, and now I see the difference.Make sure to get a big enough camera bag.", "Date": "May 16, 2009"}, {"Title": "Beware of related products", "Author": "Beverly A.

I read the reviews after I purchased it.  I agree that after you take it out of the box and just start shooting pictures, they may not come out very good.  That is why you HAVE TO READ THE MANUAL!  After reading the manual, I LEARNED how to take great pictures indoors, outdoors, low lighting, high lighting, it all does fantastic.  The pictures with this camera are perfect!  Very bright, sharp, detailed, etc.  If you learn how, you wont have a dull colored picture.Tip ---- Inside pics can be taken in the Auto Mode, but NOT the Easy Auto Mode.  Also make sure you use the flash.Tip ---- Very close up pics inches away, you should use the Micro or Macro mode.  You can experiment with the flash.At first I thought I got ripped off as the pictures looked terrible.  After reading the manual, I learned how to take awsome, sharp, great looking pictures.You just have to read and learn how to use all the options such as vibration, motion, etc.This isnt a point and shoot camera.  Thats why it cost more than a $89 camera.  Its a high quality camera for a low price of around $200.  I am very, very picky on picture quality.  This camera does great!So far, I think the battery life is better than the cameras I have had in the past that I paid just under $100 for.  It does take 4 AA batteries rather than 2 batteries.  You do not want to use rechargable batteries.  Just get the lithium batteries for about $7 for a pack of 4, and they last a good long time for any family get together.  If your on vacation, you can spend about $21 bucks and have about 3 sets for the whole week, even though you probably wont need them all.I had a fujifilm finepix 5mp camera that took awsome picutes with 3x optical zoom.  I traded it for a samsung 7mp 3x optical, but was disappointed.  My new nikon coolpix 10mp 15 optical takes just as great pictures as my old fuji film, but I now get 15x opt. zoom.I took a picture of our Christmas tree from across the room with my new Nikon and my guitar amplifier was in the picture. After I took the picture, I zoomed on on the picture (after it was already taken), and I could read the words on the amplifier knobs, from all the way across the room.  That really blew me away!!!If you are willing to read the manual and LEARN about the camera, then this is for you.  IF your not into tech stuff and learning about how to use something (like my elderly parents), then get a cheaper low end camera.", "Date": "November 29, 2009"}, {"Title": "Great  Pix at First Shot", "Author": "Richard Danchik", "ReviewID": "R208EE9048XIE1", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Having returned from a National Park using a small compact Casio Exilam, I thought how nicer the photos of the wildlife I had seen would have been if I was able to bring them in closer with a better zoom. The Casio was 3x. I purchased the Nikon L100, inserted batteries,(never reading the instructions) and shot a couple of photos of my retreivers swimming and running. I was actually amazed how clear the photos came out. So much that you could see the direction of the hair blowing on the dogs. Not one that ever liked reading a manuscipt to understand how something worked, this was pretty simple. Now using some of the different modes, it is quite fun. The thing is I trust this camera to take a decent photo without having to do all of the aperture settings, etc.Is it the best out there?

Bates", "ReviewID": "R20L80YOE9LOQI", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I bought my Coolpix L100 about a month ago, before now I was a devoted Canon Powershot owner but the newer powershots are either too expensive, or too stupid.  The L100 was the right price and seemed simple enough for me to try.First, what I don't like:  No viewfinder, so if you break the LCD the camera is useless.  However, it was a chance I was willing to take since the price was low enough.  Second, it will only take movies for 25 minutes, then you will need to start up a new movie.  Usually my movies are less than that time anyway, but still I don't see a reason to limit the movie time if your SD card can handle a longer movie time.  Your battery life will be VERY low, once again because of the only LCD option, and you are not supposed to use rechargeable batteries.  so get used to buying a lot of double A's.Now what I do like:  It takes wonderful pictures, very warm, and is by far the simplest camera to use.  If you want a camera that lets you to adjust speed/light/etc then buy THAT type of camera, don't buy the simple ones for people that just want to take pictures.  This, is set up so even a child can take a good picture.  Back Light option takes great pictures of people in front of windows, Macro takes great close up, etc.  Zoom is awesome, although it doesn't work nearly as well when you are shooting a movie.So, for the money, definately a good purchase.  For a bit more money I would have liked a viewfinder, more movie time and more zoom capability while shooting in movie mode, other than that it's a wonderful camera.", "Date": "July 11, 2009"}, {"Title": "Unskilled Photographer Likes Camera", "Author": "Marie Lewis", "ReviewID": "R2SBFY7C09PCFC", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I am not a great photographer and I appreciate that this camera is not all that complicated.  I admit that like other reviewers I was at first a bit disappointed because the pictures were not as good as I had expected.  I had trouble with the different settings and even had trouble lifting the flash.  Then one day I was out and my 19 year old daughter grabbed it and took some of the most amazing pictures.  She is quite proficient with Nikon as she has a Nikon DSLR as well as a small Nikon point and shoot that she keeps in her purse at all times.  I realized then that the problem was not the camera but me.  After some practice I was much better at taking pictures and I love many features about the camera.  The zoom is incredible.  I love it.  I got great pictures of hummingbirds and cardinals close up.The flash is great as you have to raise it to take a flash picture.  At first I did not like that but now I do.  It gives me more control.  I love the camera and am still learning.The one thing I do not like is that the batteries are not rechargeable.  I keep the AA batteries in my purse so it does not go dead.  So far I have not had to change them and I have had the camera for about 6 weeks but I feel nervous about it.

I am fairly hard pressed to spend the amount of money I did on a camera, so I wanted to make sure I was getting what I would pay for.  I researched for a couple of weeks finding out what went into a good camera and how to make the best of a camera I would end up purchasing.  I went into stores, talked with sales clerks, friends, family, co-workers and just about anyone I came across who liked taking pictures.  I read countless reviews, both pros and cons.  I looked hard at the cons of each camera.  Finally it boiled down to the L100.  I read some reviews of the camera not taking very good pictures or coming out fuzzy.  I have not had any trouble with this camera.I did find that buying a decent memory card made a difference in how quickly the camera can store the picture. Some complaints were made about it being a AA battery charged camera - my opinion - I'm glad I'm not worried that I didn't charge my camera the night before, or worry about it then.  I just pack some extra batteries and I'm on my way.I have taken my camera on nature walks and drug my dog along with me.

Its powerful zoom captures everything within 80 feet with fine detail. I am most impressed by the close-up shots I took. They have the looks of pro's work (I am not). Even though L100 is technically labeled a point-n-shoot because of its lack of manual controls,its pictures have the sophistication similar to other high-end SLP cameras.Most point-n-shoot cameras basically just copy what you see. This Nikon, through it lens or technology, give you something different from what your naked eyes register, like the waterdrops on a leaf.

Too bad, it's a nice looking camera, nice lens, just junk internal works and cheap firmware apparently. Having owned and used the old reliable Nikon FG 35mm SLR (non-digital) for many years, and also a Nikon \"One Touch\" Zoom 90 (Digital \"point and shoot\"); I was really disappointed with the dismal image quality of the CoolPix L100. Nikon really has drastically lowered the quality of their products, if this is any example. I couldn't produce many decent photos indoors or out, most were not even close.  Almost every single photo was either blurred, extremely grainy, or washed out, etc...and, Yes, that's both with or without the flash. Mostly, the photos were just plain out of focus. I read the manual, tried various and multiple different settings, then buckled down and methodically tried almost every setting in a massive effort to get one single halfway decent \"near\" closeup facial shot, but all for naught. So, I went to the store, got some film and took shots with my Zoom 90 just to get a few focused quality shots. Needless to say, I am sending the CoolPix L100 back immediately.  Thanks goes to Amazon for their return policy. The sad part is, - I paid nearly $25.00, which is unrecoverable, to have this junker delivered the next day.

I was shocked at the negative reviews for a Nikon (any Nikon). Among the positive reviews were notes about using the camera and READING THE MANUAL. After downloading the manual from the Nikon web site and reviewing the almost 150 pages of the manual, I understood the positive reviews that said you have to invest some time to really read the manual. Although I was still a bit nervous. I decided to go for it.I am VERY HAPPY with this camera. When first playing with it I had some oddly grainy photos. I went to the manual, figured out what I was doing wrong and tried taking the same photos in the same conditions a second time (inside closeups since that was the complaint I read about most). I got BEAUTIFUL RESULTS.If, like me, you are considering this camera and are a bit concerned about the negaive reviews, I can only say to you that THIS IS NOT A POINT AND SHOOT CAMERA. I expect it's going to take me a while to master all of the guidance in the manual, but I also expect this will be the only camera that I will need for a LONG time.If you're looking for a point and shoot camera, you might be very dissappointed with this purchase (you can almost count on that).

I couldn't tell you how many times I've wanted to throw it out of sheer frustration. Don't get me wrong, the L100 IS capable of producing beautiful, high quality photos, but they are so few and far between that it's not even worth it. I think Nikon should have spent alot less time making a convenient camera that does everything for you (including asking if the person blinked- really??) and worked more on creating a better camera. If the photo isn't taken at the exact millisecond of perfection then you just get a crap, semi clear photo. Outdoors is the best way to get good lighting, all the indoor lighting features over expose the color and the photos always need to be adjusted with software because they come out either too green or too warm- especially the indoor night shots. There is no viewfinder, which I understand isn't necessary with digital but it can still come in handy. You also cannot select the shutter speed- the camera determines that on it's own which can also ruin a good photo opportunity. And God forbid the object moves within the 1.5 seconds in which you push the shutter button and the camera auto focuses to take the picture. The hi ISO feature is a joke because it only allows you to use up to 3mega pixels so I'm always debating on whether to use the other menu options with the higher mp in order to get better clarity (but in the end get the wrong lighting) or use the lower  mp, get the desired lighting but have a photo full of noise. I think Nikon really missed the boat on this one. And of course you realize the photo is no good only after it's been taken and you've either lost the opportunity altogether or you have to fiddle with the dozens of menu photo options and select a different one with the hopes it will come out better the second (or third, or fourth) time around. The user is extremely limited and hardly able to take photos to their fullest potential because the camera determines way to much for its own good. If that's your cup of tea, then by all means go for it but chances are you will only achieve several nice, mediocre photos and only a couple excellent ones. In my opinion if you are a novice photographer save a hundred bucks and get a cheaper camera that can take just as decent of a photo as this one and if you are an experienced photographer spend the extra money and get a digital SLR (or heck, use the 'ol 35mm film SLR) instead.

Really, it was a bald eaglein a dead tree which let me get close enough to get about 8 shotswith my cell phone camera.  None of them were viewable.  Then Istarted carrying around an older Kodak p&s;, curtesy of my spouse. Iactually saw the eagle again and got what I thought were some okexposures...Wrong.  No way to tell whether the bird was an eagleor a vulture.  I was unable to get close enough.  So I researcheda bit, knowing I needed some optical telephoto capability.  But I was not going to make a big investment at this stage fo the game.  I've always respected Nikon quality and utility and the L100 fell withinthe range I was willing to spend...just barely.  Unfortunately, Igot it slightly used...$5 more and could have gotten a new one.  ButI got confused in my ordering.  Anyway, the camera and accessorieswere fine...the only problem was that there was no operating manual.After about an hour of trying to figure things out, I gave upand downloaded one from Nikon.

I am constantly leaning on the L100's review button as I'm preparing to change settings. It's turned off by an easily accessible button, but it's still cutting into my shoot time. To access the controls with my thumb my knuckles are driven into the lens casing. (This is hard to get a feel for anywhere if the camera is attached to a security cable in a brick and mortar store.) Will be looking into some sticky-backed foam to build up the side grip and put a pad on the side of the lens. (A can cozy and omnigrip glue has solved the padding and accidental keying problems. I also added a square of foam to the side of the flash unit so I can flip it with  my right index finger.)Macro/Telephoto - would prefer a button for this, but macro is on the ring two clicks away (Macro focusing is successful only in high light conditions. Indoors and shade is too challenging for the focus.)Flash - Have to flip it up by hand. If my fingers were a tad longer I could probably also do that with my index finger. Seems powerful, but there are a number of settings including white balance and exposure that should be able to decrease whiteouts. (Adding a foam square solved the easy access flash problem.)Flash on macro - Depending on the angle you're shooting, you may get the lens shadow in your photoType of flash - Decide what you need beforehand. Scrolling through the choices from the ring means your portrait subject will have already moved. (Might be made up for in Sport mode. It is, but sports mode has lower megapixel.)Lens cover - will only attach if camera is off. I like keeping the lens cap on to protect from bumps between shots.Blurry photo complaint - I'm not seeing any unusual focus problems. (Sometimes has problems focusing even when on landscape. It's possible scenes holds the solutions, but I don't have time to read through the icons and select when I'm shooting.)Transcend card complaint - No problem using the bundled SDHC card (though my laptop is too old to recognize it - skip the bundle and buy an SDHC card that comes with a reader or be sure to add one (or two, one for the camera case and one for the laptop case) to your orderRechargeable battery issue - not tested yet - (Ran on rechargeables once.

I don't mind customizations to get the feel of the camera right and the lack of dedicated function buttons may be overcome with familiarity.

Reviews claimed that the image quality was good, and that the 15x zoom was excellent.  Descriptions basically described that as a point and shoot with a decent zoom.  I do not entirely agree with this assesment.In many ways this camera does act like a point and shoot, allowing you to snap pictures of mediocre left and right.  However, the image quality suffers greatly if you are not in the right \"image-mode\" for each type of picture.  Example: If you are indoors with low lighting then you better be in \"in-door\" mode and have the flash on.

Also, my last camera housed the SD card in a separate compartment from the batteries.  This camera has the SD slot and batteries in the same compartment.  This is difficult if you need to switch SD cards because you have to be careful not to dump the batteries.  The last problem with the camera is minor, but annoying.  The lens cap MUST be removed before you turn on the camera.  It will not let you continue use if you turn it on while the lens cap is on.  VERY annoying.

I bought this a day before a cruise I took all across Oceania and it worked like a charm.  I just have to say that the one day shipping is excellent as well.The things I'm disappointed with on this camera are:1.  When the camera is zoomed all the way out, it will not focus on anything.  What sometimes works is focusing on your subject before zooming out and then once you have it as far out as you like, press the shutter all the way down and not half way down.  Sometimes the camera will try to focus again anyways which will lead to nothing being focused on and sometimes this techniques works great.2.  When trying to take pictures at night, the camera won't flash even if I have the flash up.  It won't let me change the flash setting either even when the picture mode isn't on night shot.3.  There isn't much going on in the menu.  Compared to other simple compact cameras that I have had, this camera has very limited settings to play around with.  The most disappointing setting that this camera is without is an option to take a picture is black and white, sepia tone, etc.  I've always had that option in other cameras.For the things I like about this camera:1.  The zoom is incredible.  If you have a steady hand and are able to get the camera to focus, you can have great pictures of things you can't or don't want to get close to.2.  I've taken some really cool macro shots with this camera.This camera is well worth it's price and is a great camera for those who want more power than a simple point and shoot but can't afford a DSLR.

Don't get discouraged by this. Pick an appropriate setting (portrait or landscape usually work for most things), and don't make it more complicated than it needs to be. The sports continuous setting is amazing. It will shoot 30+ pictures in sucession to make sure you get the best action shot. Used this at a football game and it was awesome.

Too many \"pros\" to name about the camera (including amazing photos. I get compliments now even though 1.) it is \"only\" 10.1 mp & 2.) we have all this new technology with cameras at many more megapixels!)Cons:Low light is probably the worst. Photos just do NOT come out without the flash. I have tried messing with the exposure compensation, but if you are not holding your camera perfectly still or the subject is not perfectly still, they will blur. Same goes for \"moon\" photos...will not work.Macro -- sometimes what you are trying to focus on is taken over by the autofocus and it focuses on whatever is BEHIND the thing you are TRYING to photograph. But once you learn to manipulate it, you can usually figure it out.Batteries -- I bought this camera to be able to use AA batteries...only to find out that the camera is super picky. It will not handle rechargeables (which was 90% of the reason I wanted to use AA!) and finding ones that will work in the camera without it automatically shutting off was a pain. Energizer, Duracell, top end batteries would not work. Get a cheap set at RiteAid and it loves them! Cannot figure that one out!

I have not used it yet for these purposes, so I intend to report back later on my experiences.What I can tell is this camera is very straight-forward to use.  The Easy-Shot mode will have most point and shoot photographers (like me) up and running quickly.  Easy to handle, has a nice feel.  The display is well designed, I haven't use it outside in daylight yet so not sure how well it handles glare.  Lot's of features for a reasonable price.  Works like a point-and-shoot digital with a little of the feel of a SLR.This camera works with NiMH rechargeable batteries if you desire.  One tip- after first installation of the NiMH batteries you change the battery selection (to NiMH), your battery meter will appear to be low.

It uses the same lens but has a 12MegaPixel sensor instead of 10.  Also, the image stabilizer is noticeably improved.  But I wouldn't recommend buying ether camera.  Both produce sharp images only in bright light where you get smaller lens opening (but larger numbered) f-stop settings.  The image quality is very poor if the lighting is much darker than a well lit store.  Also, they both lack direct user controls of ISO (light measurement method set by the International Organization of Standardization).  Neither camera is good in low light.  Results are fuzzy and grainy.###-SAME DAY UPDATE-###I'm changing my rating from ONE STAR to THREE STARS.  While all I have written above is true, the L100 does work well in ideal conditions.  And it does contain some miracles of our times. I think the lens is a bit too soft.  But the reason I don't rate it higher is because the L100 is way behind the competition.  (Checkout canon's line of small cameras.  The newer ones can be a bit pricey but they are a lot better than this Nikon.)I bought a Nikon L100 because of its size, portability, appearance, easy macro ability, and the extreme telephoto.  I didn't plan to reduce the use of my Single Lens Reflex (Canon Rebel 450D,T2i).  I just wanted a small camera only for some macro shots - and some long telephoto shots - with a camera that wont weigh me down.  The nearby discount store offered the L100 for $199.99.  At the time I thought that was a great price.  I trusted the Nikon brand name.  I should have checked the Internet reviews before buying any kind of camera.  I'm disappointed; but I can still get some use from this camera.  I'm not taking it back.While I want to agree with the ONE STAR reviewers, they must all be very serious amateurs.  No professional photographer would use such a camera - not in 2010.None the less, I now think that THREE STARS is more fair.  The L100 isn't really too awfully bad.  And the L110 is probably better.  Both are made for beginners and casual picture takers.  Such people might actually love the newer and lower priced Nikon 110.  It can take pictures that would have been impossible with a consumer digital camera ten years ago.

I am happy with it, but I do have two complaints.CONS: First, Nikon did not include Fireworks in the mode on this camera.  I called Nikon, and was informed by a representative that the camera DOES have fireworks. She had me go online and right there with my own eyes I saw that Nikon's Tech Specs showed that this camera included Fireworks.  I loved the Fireworks mode on my Nikon Coolpix S550 and took some amazing fireworks photos (using a small tripod).  But the L100's user manual makes no mention of fireworks, and the camera does NOT include fireworks.  Nikon would not call me back, even though the rep elevated the call to Level 2. I then tried contacting them online.  I included a screenshot of the Tech Specs from their site along with asking if there was a way to upgrade the firmware to include fireworks. They closed my case and never contacted me.  Next thing I know, Nikon's website has removed fireworks from the Tech Specs.  Great customer service, Nikon. NOT.  The other complaint, of lesser importance is I wish the L100 had the 2 second timer which I miss (my Nikon Coolpix S550 had it). It is great to take eBay photos. I don't need 10 whole seconds for things like that. I really can't believe that Nikon is going to ignore me. I will definitely rethink ever investing in another Nikon camera.Almost every review I found on the Internet states that the camera has fireworks. I'm sure this is because they copied Nikon's original erroneous description word for word.  It is frustrating because how are you supposed to trust a company that says one thing and does another?  I'm sure somebody just made a mistake and put fireworks into the Tech Specs. But the camera has been out for many months, maybe even as long as a year and no one caught it?  Now that I've brought it to their attention, they are trying to cover up and pretend it never happened. Shame, Nikon.  At the VERY least you could have called me back, thanked me for bringing the mistake to your attention and apologized profusely.This camera DOES TAKE RECHARGEABLES batteries, contrary to reviews stating the opposite. Nikon put together firmware so the camera can be upgraded to accept rechargeables. This is a sweet upgrade, and I wish they would do the same with the fireworks and the 2 second timer. If you buy a camera today, it should already be upgraded so that it WILL TAKE RRechargeable Ni-MH Battery EN-MH2.PROS: I like the handgrip (although I am having to learn to place my thumb differently as I keep pressing view accidentally). I love the zoom capacity. I have been able to get some AWESOME shots of the full moon. You do have to be in telephoto zoom in order to get clear shots *AND* use a tripod to stabilize.  Speaking of the image stabilizing - it is excellent. Last year I took Santa photos for my job using my Nikon Coolpix S550 and had to use a tripod to get really good pictures. This year I brought my tripod, but ended up taking many shots freehand. The camera performed wonderfully.  Hardly any blurry photos. I like that it doesn't flash unless you open the flash door. This makes it so much quicker to take photos without flash. Just don't open the flash door!  On the other hand, if the scene does require the flash, it won't work without remembering to open the flash door. Nice big monitor and lens. The camera makes me look like I paid a lot more for it.  There was also the learning curve to remember to TAKE the LENS CAP off BEFORE turning on the camera, or the dreaded \"lens error\" appeared. However, turning the camera off and back on it goes away.All in all I'm happy with this camera; although my trust in Nikon has been knocked down several notches.I upgraded to this camera because my Nikon Coolpix S550 started getting lens errors which seemed to be directly related to the battery/SD card door not closing properly. The door closing issue got worse the longer I owned the camera, although I was very careful to close the door properly. The S550 lasted just 17 months and is now too unreliable to continue to use. I hope the L100 has a longer life.", "Date": "December 26, 2009"}, {"Title": "Nice little camera", "Author": "Nan Krajewski", "ReviewID": "R35USURY7GX34Z", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I bought it as it was in 2 day delivery pack.

I'm by no means a professional photographer, but I do take TONS of pictures. This is my 3rd digital camera. First was a Canon that I had some major problems with after less than 2 years, had to send it off to be fixed then it broke again & I finally ended up buying a Sony. I've had the Sony about 2.5 years & have had no problems w/ it. I still like it for every day stuff (it's small & fits in my purse), but I really wanted a camera w/ more zoom & this Nikon is perfect.I went to Hawaii shortly after I bought the camera & it's very easy to use. I learned all the features quickly w/out reading the manual. I took it everywhere, took about 500 pics & they all came out great. My friend who lives there loved it & says it's better than her SLR. I got some wonderful pics of her kids on the beach using the \"beach\" setting. I also got great sunset pics w/ the \"sunset & dusk/dawn\" settings. The indoor pictures turn out great as well...the color is very nice.The camera is not heavy, very comfortable to wear around your neck w/ the strap. I wish it would've come w/ a case, couldn't even find one through Nikon. I ended up buying a Sony case from Walmart & it fits perfectly.This is a great camera for someone who wants something a little more professional than a point & shoot, but doesn't want the price or size of a SLR. When my friends see the lens on this thing, they think it's really expensive & cannot believe I got it at Amazon for just over $200. Amazon definitely has the best price since you don't pay shipping or tax. I did a lot of research & couldn't decide what brand is best...I think you never really know what can happen w/ electronics.

I'm not super camera savvy and this camera is easy for me to navigate. The menu and options are easy to use. I do have a couple complaints. I think it's nuts that you HAVE to take the lense cap off to even turn on the camera. Which means you have to take off the lense cap even if your not taking pictures and just wanted to view them. I've also had a little bit of problems taking indoor photographs. After many trial pictures I think I've got it figured out, but the quality isn't as good as outdoors. For the most part the auto mode works with what i'm using it for, but every once in a while I'll have to change the setting or brightness to get the picture to turn out. But over all I'm extremely happy with it, it's a major step up from my last camera and is a very easy point and shoot camera.
