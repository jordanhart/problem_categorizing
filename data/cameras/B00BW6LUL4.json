Really impressed with the picture quality of the camera and the overall speed.  Colors and picture quality are quite good and the low-light performance is superior.  The previous review focuses nicely on the picture quality, so I wil stick with the human factors.Manual control and adjustment are simple to master, so you won't need to rely on the automatic settings.  My only concern with the camera is hat the wifi settings are difficult to set up.  I'm pretty good with wireless technologies and it took me quite awhile to figure it out.  Make sure you run the set up disk.  Unlike many other consumer wireless gadgets, this one requires that you run the setup software.  Couldn't just turn on the camera and connect it to the router.  As much as it pains me to say this, I should've read the directions prior to jumping in to try to set it up!  :-)Once it's setup, it works great.  I've been transferring files to iphone, ipad, and laptop;  and transferring to the Canon Image site.  All directly from the camera.  Even emailed my wife a link to a photo directly from the camera.  Camera IS a bit of a battery hog, but I was expecting it.Update:  Since I concentrated on human factors in my review, I thought I would weigh in on flash location interfering with handholdposition.  Personally, I didn't notice it until I read the other reviews.  I've had other cameras with pop up flashes, so I think I just automatically adjusted to it.  That said, I can see how it would annoy some people.  The flash is located in the front left-hand corner of the camera, but there IS sufficient space behind the flash to place your finger.  Could be a problem if you have large hands, I suppose..  Motor is also strong enough to remind me to move it when it pops up.----------------------------Update 20 May::  There is a glitch that's been widely reported that shows that the battery is drained when in video mode.  This is a glitch in the indicator, not the actual battery life.  Cannon has acknowledged the problem and is working on a fix.  Expect the next firmware update to address the issue.-----------------------------Update 5 June:  New Firmware Released Today!!  Details Firmware Version 1.0.2.0 incorporates the following fixes and improvements:1. Increases the duration of movie shooting by 20% in cases where the optical zoom is used compared to cameras running Firmware Version 1.0.0.0 or Firmware Version 1.0.1.0 through a reduction in the power consumption of the optical zoom.*Time under default camera settings, when normal operations are performed, such as shooting, pausing, turning the camera on and off, and zooming. (based on conditions established by Canon).-Under some shooting conditions, the recording time may be shorter than mentioned above.-Recording time with a fully charged battery.2. Fixes a phenomenon with cameras running firmware version 1.0.0.0, in which the low battery level warning is prematurely displayed while shooting in movie mode.Firmware Version 1.0.2.0 is for cameras with firmware Version 1.0.1.0 or Version 1.0.0.0. If the camera's firmware is already Version 1.0.2.0, it is not necessary to update the firmware. Please note that, once the camera is updated to the latest version, it cannot be restored to a previousI installed it with no problems.", "Date": "April 25, 2013"}, {"Title": "A Great Campact Camera", "Author": "Just Another Reviewer", "ReviewID": "R2K9JHH2BIM9VI", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "Enough said about how good this compact camera is in the other reviews. Only two quick comments: It is an excellent compact zoom camera complimentary to my SLR camera/lens collection on the road for quick shots (photo & video) without lens changing. Case Logic DCB-302 Compact Case provides good protection and a perfect fit with room for extra battery and SD card.Update 5/8/2013: Per Canon technical support, the battery inside the camera cannot be charged via USB port like your cell phone when connecting to PC or outside USB power source.Update 5/13/2013: When using \"AUTO\" on the dial as well as \"\"AUTO\" ISO\" in \"P\", \"Tv\" and \"Av\", the ISO is automatically selected from 80 to 1600, not to 3200 or 6400.  To manually select ISO 3200 or 6400 in \"P\", \"Tv\" and \"Av\", you need to select \"FUNC. SET\" and then choose the 3200 or 6400 under the\"ISO\" list.Update 5/19/2013 The flashing \"low battery\" warning in the video mode is indeed a design fault of the battery indicator not the battery itself.  With a freshly charged battery, I can take either around 200 photos or about 30 minutes video (1080p 30fps).  The low battery warning comes in about 2 minutes into the video shooting after some zooming.Update 5/20/2013  Per Canon technical support, Canon is trying to resolve this \"low battery\" warning issue in the video mode.  Decided to return this wonderful camera. Will buy it when the issue is resolved.Update 6/5/2013  Canon just published a firmware update for SX280 to fix the low battery warning issue in the video mode at this web link: ([...] Click on \"Drivers & Software\". Select your computer's Operating System and OS Version.  Click on \"Firmware\". Download the firmware zip file and unzip the file.  Follow the instruction in the PDF file to update the firmware.Update 6/7/2013 I repurchased a new SX280 with the hope that the low battery warning issue has been fixed by this firmware update.  I updated the new camera to the new firmware 1.0.2.0 from 1.0.1.0 following the procedure in the PDF file.  The premature low battery warning in the video mode for the updated SX280 has improved but not fixed.", "Date": "May 1, 2013"}, {"Title": "Terrific Camera Overall", "Author": "J. Malinsky", "ReviewID": "RMF054I5MPB4I", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Hi thereI've replied to a few reviews of this product before choosing to write my own, while keeping in mind everyone's opinions (especially about the battery) thus far.Out of the way, I too noticed \"problems\" when shooting video on a not-fully charged battery. I put the word in quotes, because in my experience/view, it's really a software problem that can be fixed with an upcoming firmware update. It just flashes red prematurely, and you can certainly repeat steps to have that happen consistently. Also, you'll only get about 30 minutes or so of 1920/60fps HD video per charge (keep in mind the battery will likely be flashing red most of the time). But keep in mind, its really just a bug. When you power up your camera, the true charge is shown on the indicator.I took the camera with me today to shoot a typical days worth of exciting things with my kids. I took about 35 photos, and a combined 7 minutes of full HD/1920/60fps video. I also transferred a few images wirelessly to my Android phone. After all that, my battery is still showing as fully charged and does not do the 'premature red battery' even if i take it to video. So that seems like a decent day for me, and it doesn't show a dent (and rightly so). I'll just have to remember to charge the battery fully before I take it out.In the end, I do recommend the camera because of what I bought it for: excellent, truly best-in-class images from a camera under $400. This camera is my '2nd' camera, for times when I don't feel like dragging my DSLR around. The images aren't as good as a DSLR (no surprise) but they are by far the best images I've taken with a point-and-shoot. The 20x optical zoom is truly incredible, and the true/natural Image Stabilization (*not* digital) is fantastic: you can actually take a 20x zoomed picture without it being blurry!  Not only that, the IS during video shooting makes it smooth-as-silk on playback, especially in truly stunning 60fps mode. Shutter-lag isn't as good as a DSLR (because the concept doesnt exist with mirrors), but it's miles ahead of my last 2011 P&S; and also faster than my 2013 smartphone camera.I can see why the video/battery issue is so frustrating: the video from this thing is truly amazing (stereo, Image Stabilization, and did I mention 1920 and 60fps yet??!) and you *want* to shoot a ton with it. It's also in ultra-convenient mp4 format right out-of-the-camera.  And it does a superb job of focusing as you zoom on video (my older p&s; wouldn't let me zoom in video mode at all). But if video is really your mojo, get a camcorder for the same price and be happy. If you're after stills, or shooting video \"shorts\", this is your bet.  And hopefully the short-ish battery on video will make better videographers out of people by forcing them to cut down on the extra crap they shoot that nobody watches anyways :)Touching on a few remaining things: I love that the camera has a metal body, love its hefty weight (remember when cameras felt like cameras and not TV remotes?) and dig the wireless. I'm not a GPS guy because the privacy issue freaks me out, so I don't run the GPS. As mentioned by other reviewers, the wireless is a bit tricky to set up if you want to go camera->computer wirelessly - you'll have to run the software on the CD (it retrieves the latest version from the net automatically).  The easiest set-up is camera->smartphone; as long as they're on the same network, transfers are easy. If there's no wireless where you're shooting, you can actually use the camera as an access point itself and connect your smartphone/tablet to the *camera's* network. Keep in mind that the wireless transfer is *not* eye-fi: you have to *select* the images you want to send, after they've been shot (photos aren't automatically transferred wirelessly as you shoot). Believe it or not, you can actually tweet from the camera itself.  That being said, I think the omission of Flickr is a drag, but perhaps that's because they are pushing their own \"Canon Image Gateway\" service for photo sharing/storage.Also, I appreciate the restraint in megapixels... the filesizes and document sizes are realistic and appropriate for people who aren't blowing photos up to large dimensions. Focusing on image quality instead of megapixel count is a much welcomed approach in my opinion, and I hope the ridiculous megapixel race slows down in order to focus on the sensor quality/lenses that can be crammed into a P&S; size camera.Also, coming from DSLR world, I'm actually pretty happy with the amount of customization offered. The manual (on the CD only) is chock full of information, including how to use the self-timer in \"wink\" mode (wink to take the shot!!). All modes I shoot on (M/AV/TV/P) offer *center only* focus. I haven't seen that mentioned too often, but that is *exactly* what I like - in fact the first thing I do on my DSLRs/new cameras is turn off the 'smart autofocus' to use center-point only).  It means you might have to take a moment to frame the shot you want (focus then frame), but to me it cuts down on silly camera \"intelligent\" errors when it focuses on things with contrast instead of the content that matters.I don't find the position of the pop-up flash an issue; my finger fits behind it. Also, consider that the pop-up flash reduces red-eye quite significantly by being further away from the lens. Not only that, but this camera is *great* in low-light for a point-and-shoot - ease up on the flash and enjoy the great new processor!This camera does exactly what I want it to do, and does it *really well*, but if I was planning on a day of really heavy shooting with video, I'd buy a spare battery. And I'm looking forward to a firmware update!", "Date": "May 11, 2013"}, {"Title": "Amazing camera but major design flaw!", "Author": "Dave", "ReviewID": "R3LIDACXDUUEO7", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I have been using Canon cameras since around 2001 (this is probably the 10th Camera I have owned in the PowerShot series over that time-frame).We purchased this camera specifically for a trip to South Africa since we planned on taking several photos of animals in the wild at far distances, but didn't want to bring along something the size of a DSLR. First of all, I must say that the photos that this camera takes are nothing short of spectacular.  The focus is crystal clear for most shots and the zoom is amazing for something that fits in a pocket.  In my opinion, this camera took photos nearly as good as some of the DSLR cameras that other people in our tour group had.  In fact, the owners of those DSLR cameras were shocked by the quality of this camera as well and have asked me to send them some photos of animals that came out blurry on their cameras but came out perfectly on this camera.The optics of this camera are very impressive given the wide range of zoom.  Chromatic aberration is noticeable but not terrible on some images at full zoom.One minor issue is that the flash pops up and is in a very annoying area for most people (where most people place their left hand on the camera).  I personally got used to holding the camera differently to get around the annoyance, but it is still a problem for when we ask someone else to take our photo.Now for the reason I gave this camera one star.This camera suffers from the same issue posted by numerous other reviewers where the camera immediately shuts down due to low battery while attempting to record video and using the zoom feature simultaneously.  This happens even on a full charge (tested with several different batteries including the original).  This is a well documented issue (do a web search for \"canon sx280 battery problems\" and you will see.).  Removing the battery and reinserting it causes the battery meter to show a full charge again and the camera functions just fine until attempting to take video again where the problem repeats itself.Canon claims to have fixed the issue with a firmware patch. I performed the firmware update advised by Canon and verified that the new firmware was correctly installed however as other reviewers can confirm this still did not solve the problem. Note that the firmware update only requires a blank 32MB SD card, not an expensive 32GB SD card that other users have reported (big difference between price of an 32 MB card vs 32 GB).I have a theory that this problem is a design flaw at the hardware level that can not be fixed with software (firmware).  It appears to be a hardware problem not correctable by any firmware updates caused by the battery voltage during times of high power draw (encoding the video plus zooming).  Canon is very aware of the issue and so far has not recalled the camera.  I am not sure why they are trying to sweep this issue under the rug at the expense of their reputation.Some people are reporting that the firmware update fixed the problems.  Maybe that is true for cameras made after a specific date. According to the canon firmware update instructions, this problem affects cameras where the 6th digit of the serial number is lower than 3.  The 6th digit on mine was a 2.So if you have one of these where the 6th digit is a 2 or lower and experience the same problem, then please return it to Canon and don't just \"live\" with the problem as I almost did.I ultimately returned the camera and will keep purchasing the same camera and returning it until I am one of the \"lucky ones\" with a 6th digit of a serial number greater than 2 so that I can have a fully working camera with video.", "Date": "December 7, 2013"}, {"Title": "Very good for a compact SuperZoom camera", "Author": "Scott \"Sdallnct\"", "ReviewID": "RM3FMP588AW42", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Summary,Overall I like this camera. It takes good photos at low ISO/bright light and solid photos as the ISO moves up. Video quality is good. Great zoom range and in a compact \"fit in your pocket\" camera. I have not seen the battery life issue some have mentioned (but see review).Detail,OK, so I was looking for a camera that I could take to concerts, put in my pocket, be compact. I had previously ignored the superzoom category as they were notorious for bad pic quality. Long slow lens and small sensors. But I just didn't always want to carry my DSLR around, but was going to be in situations where I needed a long lens (I already had a couple decent 3x zoom P&S; cameras).My search landed me on a Fuji, as I like the idea of shooting RAW. But the newest model was more than I wanted to spend. I next settled on the Canon SX260HS for the good reviews. Of course I then saw the SX280HS was out with supposed better low light (something I was interested in) and Wifi (also something I have used on my bigger camera). So I went with it.I've now taken a couple hundred photos with it including three concerts.Overall for this type of camera, I'm very, VERY pleased. But lets not get carried away. With the slow lens and smaller sensor it cannot and does not and should not be considered a DSLR (or any larger sensor camera) replacement. However, in low ISO/bright light the pics are very good. Easily good enough to crop, and print to a reasonable size. In lower light the pic quality does drop, but is still good. And very usable.Specific notes,-The zoom range is fantastic. And while I started with the digital zoom off, even using it, yielded good results. Be aware at that magnification it is hard to hold the camera still. The camera does a good job of helping with image stabilization, but it can only do so much. But I've taken some nice photos even at 30x (that includes the digital zoom(. I also like that the wide angle go to an equivalent of 25mm.-I've shot one short (about 8 minute) video on it. I'm really not a video shooter, but I gave it a try. It will be something I do more of! It turned out well. The focus didn't seem to react as quickly, but zooming was smooth.-Size, I mainly bought so I could carry in my back pocket of jeans. OK so it is a little big for that and much bigger than other \"back pocket\" camera's I have. But it is doable. Worked well in concerts where most no longer allow \"professional\" cameras. It feels solid in your hands, though a very slightly larger grip would be helpful with such a long zoom.-The controls are fairly intuitive. I shoot a lot in manual (especially in low light) and it was pretty easy to figure out. I've also shot in some of the auto modes and got good results. I have not tried any of the specialty settings. Focus is quick. Again not DSLR fast, but quick and reliable.-I have not set up the Wifi yet. I realize there are some complaints with it about not being able to send pic's instantly to an iPad for example. However, I have no intention of doing that. I like the Wifi so if I'm taking pic's of friends or family and they want one, I can send to my iPhone and send it to them. I do this all the time with my larger camera w/an SD card that has the wifi in it.A special note about the battery. After reading about battery life and figuring it would eat batteries I bought two more. However, I've yet to use them. At one concert I had shot about 50-60 photos and then shot a full song (about 8 minutes) on video. Indeed the battery light came on. However, I thought I'd see how much longer it would last. After turning off video and going back to camera the battery light went off and I bet I shot close to another 100 pic's. I also paused at times to view pic's and delete obvious bad one's. And while I didn't have Wifi on, I did have the GPS thing on. So, so far, it hasn't been as bad as I anticipated. But I'll say more testing is needed.Overall,If you need/want a compact superzoom, this should be on your short list to consider. HOWEVER, if you really don't need a zoom of this length, there are better choices even from Canon. The superzoom category fills an almost unique niche. But don't think there aren't trade off's. You just need to decide what is needed for you. Though with camera prices dropping so much (this is an amazing camera at under $300, just a couple years ago would have been double that), you could buy this and another camera....So I give it 4-stars. If I was rating simply in the superzoom category, it would be almost a 5. I'd like a slightly bigger grip and to shoot RAW. If rating with all other digital camera's including those with shorter lenses, probably just 3.5 due to slightly lower pic quality. But this is an inherent issue with this category, not a reflection of this particular camera. Its just not possible to pack that much, into such a small package, at that price without giving something up. I think it fair to mention the opposite of a DSLR (or other pro-type camera). If you have only been shooting with a smartphone (any of them) and were looking for something better, this would be night and day better. A huge jump in pic quality. Or if you have never shot with a DSLR and just wanted a \"good\" camera, this would be a good choice. It is versatile, compact and fun!!", "Date": "May 26, 2013"}, {"Title": "mcasale16", "Author": "michele", "ReviewID": "R6MXCYBO00LNT", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "Canon SX280 HS- I LOVE the picture quality and range!! But the battery life is extremely short <90 photos. And the battery life indicator went from full to empty without warning. I have had the camera less than a week- should I return it and buy the Canon SX 260 HS instead????UPDATE- after reading the Canon Forums & some of your comments I came home and tested my 2 batteries. With the canon battery put into the camera yesterday, and used a bit-- I took an additional 200 pictures (no flash, wifi or gps) and 2 movies that exceeded 30 minutes! And while taking the movies - I tried the zoom and the red battery immediately started blinking. I turned the camera off and back on and the battery was full again. When the battery eventually died after the 30 minutes- I put in my non-canon battery and with no gps or wifi, I took about 180 pictures all with flash and zoom, and I squeezed in a 8 minute movie before it died. So - the issue is not battery life- but the battery indicator. I love the pictures-I've taken- and feel much better about my purchase. Although- this should issue should not be present in a brand new purchase!", "Date": "May 14, 2013"}, {"Title": "An terrific point and shoot and so much more.", "Author": "Tull1 \"Tull1\"", "ReviewID": "R3B8ISG3KJ5FOX", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I bought this camera to replace the Canon PowerShot SD990 IS I purchased nearly 5 years ago.  The SD990 IS was (and still is) a great camera but as I was doing more video, I wanted full 1080p HD at 30 & 60 fps (the SD990 IS offers 640 x 480). Here's a short pro & con on the camera when compared to the SD990 IS:Pro:-Full 1080p (vs the 640x480 from the 990IS)-Battery life is very good (I get about 275 pictures at 12MP and I shot a 90 second video at 1080p at 60fps). In comparison, with the less featured, nearly 5 years old SD990 IS, I would get 325+ pictures at 14.7MP and be able to shoot a 3 minute video (640x480) before the battery runs down.Con:-12 MP (from the SX280) vs 14.7MP (from the 990IS)-Noticeably heavier/bulkier than the SD 990IS (but I understand it is a lighter camera when compared to current models). Nevertheless, holding the camera comfortably is not an issue.That's it for the bullet points. The numerous bells and whistles on the SX280 reminds me of how most consumers use Microsoft Word (or most any popular software). Programs like Word offer so many features and possibilities that can be done with the software. Yet users probably don't use but 20% of the program's features.  Same with someone who I think will buy and use this camera (or equivalent from Nikon, Sony, etc). This camera has much to offer but for the most part, it's an excellent point and shoot camera and one that takes great video.  If 1080p isn't a necessity but you like 95% of this camera's features, from all I've read the previous Canon model (SX260) is the wiser and less expensive choice. If your priority is high megapixels for print and simple 720p HD video and bells and whistles are of little concern, there are Canon cameras available at 1/2 the price that will give you the same results.If I have one complaint (same as with the SD 990IS), pictures lack vibrant color.  I know that can be compensated for with features programmed in the SX280 (and possibly the SX260). But as I always touch up the pictures using Photoshop, it's not a big deal to me.  Just something to mention. And keep in mind everyone sees and interprets color differently.Bottom line: It is a great camera. I've owned Canon cameras since the AE-1 with no regrets. Know that this camera has features that most consumers looking for a 'point and shoot' won't use (but they are there to learn and use if desired). Personally, I always buy more then I know I need...and that's exactly what the SX280 is for me.  With that said, if you want to learn photography and need a pocket camera for family or social events, this (or the Canon SX260, if still available) is the right choice.P.S. I recommend getting an additional battery and a 32GB memory card (class 10). If the camera can utilize a 64GB card (I don't know if it can), then an even better choice. And if you exhaust your battery, it took a little over 90 minutes to get a recharge.UPDATE - JUNE 30: I've owned the camera for 7 weeks (and about 2,500 hi-res pictures and 19 long videos) and continue to remain happy with the purchase. While not excusing Canon for the small 1000mAh battery (which gives almost 30 minutes of 1080/30p video), I have switched to a 3rd party battery rated at 1200mAh (I also just purchased a battery that is 1450mAh rated).  With the 1200mAh, I get between 38-40 minutes of uninterrupted video w/o shooting any stills. When only shooting stills, I've shot as many as 342 pictures with juice still left in the battery. Also, I don't have any heat issues using the stronger batter vs the Canon OEM battery (both stronger batteries purchased on Amazon for a few dollars each).Also, there is a firmware update for the SX280HS that stops the low-level battery warning light from coming on too soon after shooting a video.  For me, the firmware update works. When shooting video (using the 1200mAh battery), the battery's low level warning light doesn't come on until there is about 5-7 minutes left of charge. As for shooting only pictures on a full charge, as I said I've shot 342 pictures w/o the battery low level warning light appearing.  The firmware update (available on Canon's site) is a must.

I picked this Canon camera over the Elph or one of the other canon cameras because of the DIGIC 6 processor, the superior zoom and the customer reviews saying they love the pictures from the camera.2) The picture quality is beautiful which is why we went with this camera.  The zoom and the image rendering is nothing short of amazing!  Even in dark light when the display seems to pixelate, the flash kicks on and the picture is terrific.  We love the momentary review option and like that we can turn that feature off or increase the time.  There's almost no lag between taking several pictures in a row unlike other cameras.  We couldn't be happier with the photo options on this camera.3) Video is smooth and excellent.  The slow motion feature is ok.Setup process1) The battery issue on our camera identified itself immediately when switching to video mode.  Just switching to the video mode, the battery light would blink red and within 3 seconds (not even recording anything) would power off the camera on its own.  Follow the instructions on the Canon site to upgrade the firmware to 1.0.2.0.2) After upgrading I still noticed the battery issue.  I read in one of the forums to take out the battery and pull out the memory card and leave them out for at least 20 minutes after upgrading.  This hard battery out power off fixed the battery issue and allowed the camera to work correctly.3) I encountered a number of problems setting up the wifi on the camera.  The camera would connect to my WPA2/PSK router, but wouldn't get an IP address.  After much trial and error, I manually set the IP information on the camera instead of using the automatic setting and the camera wifi worked correctly and connected to post to facebook, link to our Apple laptop, iPhone or Android phone.", "Date": "July 3, 2013"}, {"Title": "The Very Best Camera that You Might Not Want", "Author": "Randy Wakeman \"Randy Wakeman\"", "ReviewID": "R1502S9RSSZ223", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "Canon SX-280: Likely the Best Camera that You will Soon Regret BuyingCanon currently has two truly superlative small-sensor cameras, but this isn't one of them. While the Canon PowerShot SX50 HS 12MP Digital Camera with 2.8-Inch LCD (Black) and Canon PowerShot ELPH 330 12MP Digital Camera with 10x Optical Image Stabilized Zoom with 3-Inch LCD (Black) are both in the best of breed, best of class league . . . the SX-280 isn't.The SX-280 is polluted with largely meaningless features: WiFi, GPS, Hybrid Auto / Movie Digest are all battery-sucking little monsters of dubious utility. What they do is serve to illuminate what has never been the strong suit of this line, battery life, and that includes my SX230 which also has a GPS, but 14x optical zoom.What is worse is that some of the most-touted improved features of this camera (which IS both faster and slightly better in low-light than the 20x optical zoom SX260) are video-capability related. The reason this is so bad is that this camera, as released in April, is deeply flawed: with random video shutdowns and immediate low-battery (red light flashing) warnings in video mode. It should not have been rushed to release in this not ready for prime time condition at all, yet it was. A firmware fix was eventually cobbled together and finally released on the Canon website months later. While my example does not lock-up, the problems go well beyond what firmware can address. There are hardware systems flaws in this camera and no firmware can correct it. The firmware update is provided with the standard \"it is all on you\" Canon disclaimer: THE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED \"AS IS\" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE SOFTWARE IS WITH YOU. SHOULD THE SOFTWARE PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU (AND NOT CANON, CANON'S SUBSIDIARIES AND AFFILIATES, THEIR DISTRIBUTORS AND DEALERS) ASSUME THE ENTIRE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION. Few read the contracts they agree to, yes it is common language . . . but it is a long way from confidence-inspiring.Nothing is perfect, how well we all know, and there are personal considerations such as control placement and button size that folks with smaller hands will find ideal, yet others will find unbearable to try to use. I get this, for there is no such thing as one size fits all. Nevertheless, of the SX230 / SX260 / SX280 line, the SX280 remains the only one of the three released with a blatant, serious flaw. There is no dispute about this, for Canon refers to it as one of their \"high-level advisories.\" Under shooting conditions with good lighting, the SX260 is just as good of a camera without the headaches. Nevertheless, the speedier SX280 (although it has the same, 20x, F3.5 / F.6.8 lens array as the SX260) does do better in low light.The SX280's retail price has dropped from its original $330, and it now is a bargain in this class at $239, or WOULD BE if it worked as promised. Already there are piles of lightly used and \"as new\" examples selling for $200 or less. Not a bad deal if video is totally unimportant to you, and battery life in general isn't, either. But, there are options: the Fujifilm FinePix F900EXR 16MP Digital Camera with 3-Inch LCD (Black)that has the same zoom range, even faster autofocus, and captures RAW. In the Bargain Class, still 20X zoom: Fujifilm FinePix F850EXR 16MP Digital Camera with 3-Inch LCD (Black) currently at $209 (less elsewhere), with a 920K LCD is hard to beat for the money. If optical zoom in this form factor is of prime importance to you, the SX280 is already outgunned by the 22x of the Nikon S9500, the 24x of the Olympus SH-50 iHS, and the whopping 30x of the Sony DSC-HX50V/B 20.4MP Digital Camera with 3-Inch LCD Screen (Black).CONCLUSIONIF the SX280 performed as promised and worked as described by Canon, it WOULD be a 4-1/2 star + camera at a very good price. That's exactly what it doesn't do, so there is no way I could keep it, much less recommend it. It was to be only an incremental improvement from the SX260, even if it worked flawlessly, which it does not. The case size, sensor, lens, battery, basic layout are unchanged. It is essentially the \"new DIGIC 6\"  processor that has been added, along with Wi-Fi. The HD Movie Digest and faster video frame rates just make the already very weak battery appear much weaker, with flawed circuitry that makes video attempts short, erratic, and unreliable.Though smaller, lighter, 10x zoom, and less money . .  the ELPH 330 HS is currently Canon's best pocket camera. That one is staying here, its images are superb, that is what I want a camera to do with no hassle: take excellent images. However, if the well-known video / battery issues don't bother you, feel free to ignore this review and take your chances on a SX280. Buying used makes sense here, for there is a quickly growing pile of them.Of the current crop of competitors, the similarly priced Olympus Stylus SH-50 iHS Digital Camera with 24x Optical Zoom and 3-Inch LCD (Black) is, in many ways, the camera that the SX280 isn't. Better battery life (300 shots), 25% more optical zoom, full-resolution picture acquisition during video (not just scaled), 3 axis stabilization (five-axis in video), and a touch screen that lets you instantly change the AF object and take the image, and a Smart Panorama mode that Canon still(!) refuses to implement.Copyright 2013 by Randy Wakeman and Randy Wakeman Outdoors.", "Date": "October 19, 2013"}, {"Title": "Love the camera, hate the wireless \"feature\"", "Author": "Otis Maxwell", "ReviewID": "R3FL75TOGFD3QG", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I'm a recent purchaser but long time Canon customer and want to add a few points to the reviews here. My primary application is taking candid (non-composed) food shots for my blog at burntmyfinders dot com; I've always liked Canon quick shoot cameras (starting with a very early digital Elph) because of the color balance which is very favorable for food photography. So, many of my comments are in reference to other Canons I've owned.Overall, I'm happy with the SX280. I really wanted a longer zoom than the 4:1 Elphs (guess they're no longer called that) provide. The weight and somewhat higher price tag are a fair tradeoff. Low light management with this camera is excellent and the anti-shake feature is amazing; I can zero in on a grain of rice and it's in focus without a blur. I had no trouble getting up to speed (other than the new wireless/sharing features) because the buttons and functions are similar to my previous Canon cameras. But there are a few quirks I want to report on.1. Autofocus doesn't work well with the digital zoom. Solution: turn it off. Why do you need a digital zoom anyway with 20:1 optical?2. Flash is poorly designed. It should have been a bubble on top of the camera but instead it pops up, unwanted, if autoflash is on and then you have to turn off the camera to make it go down again. Solution: turn it off. With such great low light sensitivity you are unlikely to need flash, plus your photos will be washed out if you use it.3. Whenever I take a portrait shot, I find myself accidentally pressing the menu button on the bottom of the camera. It's in the same position as on my previous Canon point-and-shoot so I guess the reason is the form factor of the camera that makes you hold it differently. I'll get used to this in time but it's an annoyance.4. The wireless feature is in my opinion a gimmick and its execution is not ready for prime time. I thought it would be great to post to Twitter, Instagram, Facebook etc directly from a high resolution camera instead of from my smartphone. But to post from the SX280 you need a wireless connection, which you have to set up in advance. It's difficult entering passwords using the tiny \"keyboard\" which won't show what you are typing so there has to be a very high error rate. If you are always on the same wireless network this process might be acceptable, but it defeats the purpose of posting quick shots and movies from sporting events, restaurants, farmers' markets etc.Note: you can also set up a connection to your smartphone, without a wireless network, and transfer movies and stills to the phone and then post from there. But it's a clunky extra step.A couple of my experiences that might save you time:1. As others have mentioned, the firmware needs to be updated as soon as you get the camera. You do this by downloading the software (the install CD will guide you in this process) to a blank SD card on your computer, which you then put into the camera. So have this ready and be sure it's a big (32 GB or higher) Series 10 card because that is what you will need to get maximum benefit from the SX280. Order with the camera if you don't have one.2. To use any of the wireless features you will need to set up an account at the Canon Image Gateway at canon.com/cig . Your email is your user name, and the password must be an alphanumeric combination--all letters or all numbers not permitted. They don't tell you this and don't correct you if you make an error, so you think you have set up your account (especially because you get a welcome email after) but when you go to sign in your account isn't recognized because it doesn't exist.These quirks keep me from giving the camera five stars, but it is a very solid four stars and I'm happy with my shots.", "Date": "July 10, 2013"}, {"Title": "Camera shuts down if video is taken?", "Author": "EON", "ReviewID": "R170KP3WBV4EBS", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I bought my SX280HS in Oct. 2013.

As I result, I sometimes miss photo opportunities.  I wanted a small camera that I could easily carry anywhere and be able to take good photos and video when the opportunity arose.I now have it in the Canon SX280.  And at a very modest price.The camera is compact and pocketable, however, I prefer to carry it on my belt in a Case Logic DCB302 which is the perfect size.This camera offers a lot:1.  Good built quality.  It feels solid, well made in your hand.2.  Excellent image quality.  Sometimes when looking at the photos it surprises how clear and sharp they are.3.  Very good color.4.  20X zoom range gives you lots of flexibility.  You can go from macro to a distant image with ease.  And no need to change lenses.5.  I prefer a view finder, but I have to say that the screen on this camera is high quality.  In sunlight that \"erases\" the screen on other point and shoot cameras I have tried, this  camera still allows you to see the scene or figure you are photographing.  Remains visible in all but super bright situations.6.  Fast continuous shooting, up to 14fps.  Unfortunately, however, when shooting at 14 fps the screen goes dark so you are shooting blind.  But at 3 fps, you continue to see what you are aiming at.  3 fps is pretty fast.  My present slr Canon 60d is faster, but the Canon slr T2i I had before it was about the same, and the camera before that was only 1.1 fps.  I tested it standing on a street corner and shooting the cars turning the corner and going down the street away from me, watching the scene all the time on the screen.  I then replayed these photos very rapidly on my computer and there was so little movement of the cars between photos that it was almost like watching video.  With 3 fps you should get pretty action shots if shooting sports events.7.  Good video.  There is a dedicated video mode that gives you more options, but you can press the video button when shooting stills and get HD video. I tested this standing on the same street corner. The video was smooth and I was even able to zoom in while shooting without loss of quality.  I can't do that with my Canon 60d.8.  Very good stabilization.I first bought the Canon SX260, but then decided to send it back and get the SX280 instead.  This was no problem, which is why I buy from Amazon.  I had liked the SX260 very much in the short time I tested it, so worried while waiting for the 280 that I might have made a mistake.  But all is well.  The SX260 was very good, the photos I am getting with the SX280 are even better.I wish that I could bracket, take at least 3 stills with different resolutions that I could assemble in my software to make a HD image, but that is not possible with this camera.  But I am not taking a star away because I realize that Canon is not going to put everything in a $200 camera that it does in cameras that cost much more.I am not using the Wifi and GPS and probably never will, so can't comment on them.  But for a camera purchased at a modest price the SX280 more than satisfies my desire for a camera that I can carry with me anywhere, including travel, and be able to take stills and video I can be proud of.", "Date": "August 20, 2013"}, {"Title": "Canon SX280 HS", "Author": "James D Olsen", "ReviewID": "RPTLDY67XTGCX", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "The last Canon Powershot that I purchased was the SX260 HS, which I thought was a fantastic secondary camera, to take along with my Canon EOS 60D.  It took very good pictures for a small point and shoot camera.  The one thing I didn't like was it's slow speed. When Canon announced the update to the SX280 HS, with much faster speed and newer processer DIGIC 6, I thought I would give it a try.  I really like the speed, amazingly fast, like using a pro SLR.  Like the SX260, the 20x zoom produces very good photos.  Of course it isn't as good as my 60D with a 500mm lens, but look at the price difference.  For a secondary camera, it is the best camera I have been able to find. When you need a picture and don't have time to change lenses, as a backup it can't be beat.  Anything Bad?  Yes, battery time.  Like the SX260, the SX280 has a short battery life, in fact, even shorter.  On a plus side, it uses the same battery as the SX260, so I have extra batteries now.  By carrying a spare battery, I haven't had any problem so far.  I like this little camera.  I do a lot of hiking and bicycling, and this is a great little camera to carry along.

I received the camera at about 2 PM and by 4 PM I had dropped it off at UPS to return it. Camera does NOT take video. While I use the camera primarly as a camera I do want to make some short 1-3 minute videos when a video tells the story better than a still photo. I put in the battery and it shows being fully charged, take several photos and camera appeared faster than the older SX230 which was one reason for wanting the new model.

Turn camera back on, switch to auto photo mode and battery shows full. Try a couple more times with same results so log on to my Amazon account to start the return process. Why both of these once fine companies would continue to not only advertize that this camera can take video and then sell the defective cameras is beyond me. If as Canon has stated there is a \"fix\" by updating the firmware then why don't they make sure any cameras being sold have that fix? Why doesn't Amazon make sure they get rid of any old inventory of cameras that do not work properly? If in fact the firmware updating does not fix the camera then Canon needs to fess up and say camera does not take video. Amazon is a big company and they should make sure that their vendors are honestly advertizing products. If Amazon does not know how to handle this situation perhaps they should talk with one of the companies they recently aquired, Zappos, about how to go about this.

If a manufacturer knows a product needs to be fixed, it should stop selling the ones manufactured with the flaw or sell them at a steep discount with a disclosure. This is NOT how great companies do things.The camera can be used without the update, but it won't be right. If you really want this camera and don't want to mess with the update, you will need to wait.Update: I did the firmware update and used the camera a bit around the house and on a day hike in the mountains. Here are some observations.A) The telephoto produces surprisingly good results in bright daylight. I used the telephoto at 20x to take a picture of a distant cliff face and to take a picture of a damselfly resting on a nearby rock. Both turned out better than I would have expected, though the color on the bright blue damselfly washed out significantly.B) The macro performance is unremarkable. I may need to work at it some more to get the most out of it, but I was disappointed in the results. It's not simple and easy to get great results. In all fairness, though, this is a relatively inexpensive 20x zoom camera with a lens that isn't optimized for low light, so I may be expecting too much.C) I left the GPS off, and the battery life doesn't seem all that bad so far in normal daylight shooting.D) Even with the firmware update, the \"dying battery notification problem\" showed up after accidentally shooting a moment of video.E) The flash works very well. I shot a night-time interior pic of my kitchen with dim light and the flash produced a thoroughly lit picture.F) The location of the flash is awkward. On a couple of occasions, the flash popped up unexpectedly in low light conditions, and both times my finger obstructed it. This camera won't win any design awards, that's for sure.G) The wi-fi function to transfer and view pictures to a smart phone works pretty well, at least on my iPhone. I had to download a Canon app from the iPhone app store. This allows you to move selected pics to the phone and then email them or whatever.Comparison to my last camera, the Panasonic Lumix DMC-ZS8 with 16x zoom:I wish I could have the Canon's zoom capabilities in my old Panasonic, which is ergonomically superior, more intuitive to use (to me at least)and has superb battery life. Unfortunately, I swore off the Panasonics after two of them in succession got dirt inside their lenses. I'd had good luck with the durability of Canons before, so I went back.Conclusion: Overall, I would say the SX280 isn't quite ready for prime time, as evidenced by the firmware issues and the continuing problem with the depleted battery warning after shooting video. Canon should have kept it in the R&D; shop a few months longer.UPDATE: I've been using this camera for several months now. I can usually shoot outdoors all day on a single battery, though I do carry an extra. I don't do video. The pop-up flash is an annoyance for its bad location.The camera doesn't do well in low-light situations like museums or shooting outdoors at dusk. It tends to lighten the pictures too much rather than capturing the scenes as they really appear.  This may be the most annoying thing about this camera besides the battery-killing video mode. I liked the low-light abilities of my cheap little Panasonic so much better. I do like the wi-fi.

I'm very pleased by the photos even at ISO 1600. The picture quality blows my ELPH 300 HS out of the water. The auto focus speed is very good for this type of camera and the videos seem fine. A few things that need to be changed. The flash location is horrible it will pop up and push your finger. For some reason it seems like most other high end point and shoots like the Sony RX100, Nikon P330 and Canon S110 have the flash in the same location. All I can say to the manufactures is put an LED flash in the body or something. I also would like to see the dial control for the different shooting modes on top like the old A series, S110 or Sony WX300. Another thing is the battery life is not very good. You may need 2-4 batteries if you are going to be taking pictures and videos all day. One other thing is this camera is missing some fun controls like the color swap and color accent. I don't no why canon took the features out. I always liked playing around with that on my ELPH 300HS. For the image quality I can live with the short comings and maybe Canon will update the software on it to get better battery life and add back some of the creative shooting modes. If Canon does that and takes out that stupid pop up flash on the next version of this camera it will be a perfect pocket zoom camera.", "Date": "May 2, 2013"}, {"Title": "Pocket and shoot", "Author": "D.

The zoom has been really cool enabling me to take shots I would otherwise not.  Been a great point and shoot thus far...This is a camera I could recommend but has some quirks, how did I end up choosing this out of another 10 possible cameras?First of all I have owned dslr's, mkiii 5d, and I shoot some pro photos and video now and then.I was after a camera that I could put in my pocket first and foremost and not be expensive but give good results over and above the iphone 5 I always have with me.  the iphone is very limited, no zoom and terrible at night time, I had considered lenses for the iphone but thought I might as well invest in a small camera.The camera was rated well on snapsort for features and the zoom interested me over the likes of the s120 which is far better quality but limited zoom and price was twice that of the sx280.  I love good cameras but why spend double my money for something I just wanted to take memory shots with.  I had considered the s120, G16, Sony RX100 mki and mkii but ultimately they were 2 to 3 times the price.It takes good clear pictures, The wifi to iphone setup was pretty quick and easy.if your keen to get your pictures up and away.I was playing with it last night and taking pictures at night with some lights in the back ground and though I would try the flash.  Typically I hate flashes and then I came across an option to expand the shutter speed during flash use for enhancing lit backgrounds.  I took 2 shots, one normal, and as expected it was a terrible typical flash on camera shot, and the background disapeared, and then used the shutter feature and the background came out fantastic showing all the lit area nicely and warm while the flash had lit the object I was taking.  A huge improvement and a feature I will use a lot.The night time shots were important to me and with the stability on I was able to hand hold prolonged shutter speeds even to 10 seconds! getting pretty reasonable shots not normally at all possible without the stability.Video stability was great to giving excellent fluid motion to panning up/down left/right simular to tripod use, this wil be a saviour when filming whatever you are and zooming in 20x optical without too much fuss.  Of course you should always stabilize the camera in both hands for best results.Cons: get spare batteries, because you will be enjoying the use of the camera I suggest getting hold of some spares to carry along with you, better safe than sorry.Control wheel is very touchy and while spinning it with your right thumb it is very easy to depress causing you suddenly to go into a menu.  Some practice and adjustment from the user is needed here.Digital zoom while in video mode you cant turn off and you will find yourself going past the 20x into digital land very easily.  I consider myself a ninja of finger control but alas i probably would spend 10 years perfecting not going into digital zoom.  This should be an option (canon please ad this in a firmware upgrade)  Otherwise dont worry too much about it the digital zoom seems very clean.Bonuses is the high speed video mode.  While lower in resolution you can take some pretty nifty shots in 120FPS or 240 FPS slow motion.  And also of course you can capture full 1080p in 60 frames which itself is pretty great.With technology progressing well do you need to spend double the money for a point and shoot?  I went with the best super zoom i could get that was price friendly, to get better you will need to spend another $100+ which for me made no point.  I'd rather use that money in a couple years when cameras are even better.  But there is no substitute for large lenses for superior optics as yet.Also to finish off with, while viewing the pictures on camera you can choose to have them fade between which adds a very nice upmarket feel to what can be a budget experience.20x zoom there is no hiding from me! and 20x means an object will appear roughly 4 x bigger than a 5x zoom.Best in price from my research.", "Date": "November 18, 2013"}, {"Title": "BATTERY ISSUE STILL EXISTS!!!!!", "Author": "Ron Sr", "ReviewID": "R21TKX75XL8GW0", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "I have had this only a week and I am returning it and replacing it with a Canon SX260 HS.

According to the Canon website if the camera has the sixth digit of 3 or higher in the serial number, the camera should not have the battery issue. I did the Firmware update prior to using the camera. The camera said the firmware was up to date and the Serial number is 3 in the sixth digit.

With the Canon NB-6L battery I could usually get several minutes of video without a low battery warning, but it didn't take very long before it started flashing. At first you could keep videoing with the warning flashing, and if you turned the camera off and then back on again the battery would read fully charged and you could take many stills without problem. You could even take video without problem as long as you had the zoom set where you wanted it BEFORE you started recording the video.  Video did not kick in the battery warning if you did not change the zoom setting while a video was being recorded. Once you adjusted the zoom during video recording the warning light would kick in--and if the battery was partially depleted (even though strong enough for many more stills), not only would the battery warning flash, but the video would often end and tell you to recharge the battery. A restart of the camera would show a partially, or even fully charged battery icon, and more stills could be shot, even using the zoom, or more video without moving the zoom while recording. However, at this point a movement of the zoom would usually immediately terminate the recording.We purchased the camera for an upcoming fortieth anniversary trip to Grand Canyon. If I knew All the videos I might take using the zoom would be on a fully charged battery, I would be O.K. with the battery issue. But I didn't want to run into terminated videos because the video opportunity occurred when the battery was just partially depleted.I purchased a set of aftermarket replacement batteries and an extra charger for under $20 from Amazon. These worked fine for stills, but ran into video issues almost immediately if the zoom was used during video. If you want to have an extra set of batteries just for photos they seem to work, but I suppose would not last quite as long. But for under $20, two extras would provide lots of extra photos, but probably very little video--and the video would likely be limited to shots that do not move the zoom during recording.Canon no longer sells the NB-6L battery. It is replaced with the somewhat stronger NB-6LH (1060 mah vs. the former 1000 mah).  One of these  batteries runs $45-50. I don't know how much difference this newer battery would make with the SX280, but the newer battery is now furnished with Canon models such as the SX510. If anyone tries the newer battery with the SX280 posting their results might be helpful.  There is also one replacement battery I now found on Amazon that is supposed to be stronger. If anyone tries this brand it would be valuable to know if it goes beyond the ability to just take photos and also improves video experience with the SX280. This battery is rated 1200mah. Here is the Amazon link for any who would like to investigate it: Replacement Batteries 1200MAH Charger PowershotIn sum, with a fully charged Canon battery you should get a few initial minutes of video with full zoom capabilities, but very quickly you will see warnings and even shutdowns unless you limit your shooting to stills or videos that do not move the zoom--although the zoom can probably be set before pressing the video record button. It is not yet clear how much, if any difference would result from the newer, stronger battery option. I might also add that it seemed if I moved the zoom more slowly during video recording, it seemed to prolong the ability to zoom somewhat, but I didn't test this out a lot, and I did find it somewhat difficult to easily control the zoom at a given speed.", "Date": "December 30, 2013"}, {"Title": "Canon PowerShot SX280 HS 12.1 MP CMOS Digital Camera with 20x Image", "Author": "J.

I bought 2 extra Vivitar batteries with higher mA-h ratings than the stock Canon batteries. If you do the math, this camera can put a huge load on the microprocessor when you ask it to take high-rate, high-resolution videos, or multiple shots. Zoom a lot at the same time, and these little batteries aren't going to hack it. In addition, Canon has something wrong (I suspect) with the battery life sensor/indicator. (My guess is the 1.0.2.0 firmware update that's available from Canon is to help that.) On the good side, that's depressed the price of this camera. Since I don't intend to take a lot of videos with this camera, I'm OK with that. :)I may have also gotten a good one. Over 2 days of playing with it, I've yet to change the battery. It's showing 2/3 charge. It has however, flashed \"charge the battery\" warnings acouple of times.For calibration, this is replacing a Canon A1100IS we bought about 4 years ago as a second camera.Pro (for me):Really good, clear picturesGood image stabilization (hand-holding at 1/15th of a second or slower!)Low noise, as low as ISO 1600Large zoom rangeManual focusDIGIC 6 processor (latest generation)Very nice screenP, Av, Tv & M exposure modesCanon's basically good control layoutSmall and light; carrying around a DSLR can be wearyingWi-Fi is handyFits in the same case as my A1100, which was originally bought for a tiny 35 mm Vivitar I carried as a 2nd camera for years. It's marked \"Samsonite World Sport, Model #20\" if that helps.Cons:Not as good a macro capability as the A1100 (which is sterling at that one thing. I'll be keeping it for that.)No viewfinder (unlike the A1100. It's not needed all the time, but it is handy)Slow GPS lock in (my Nexus shows 18 or so satellites in view, and took maybe 30 sec. to lock in. The camera took several times that)GPS power hog. (It appears to suck up a lot of power, turning it on and off a few times did seem to affect battery charge indication)No auto bracket (To be fair, that's not common on cameras, but it should be. Canon puts it on the similar S110.)No hyperfocal distance setting (You can do it manually, of course, but, Canon, why not add another click on the focus bar? There's a computer in there, you know)Lithium batteries (I prefer the A1100's NiMH AAs so you can get a new set at any Staples for cheap or use alkaline AAs in a pinch)So, with all of 2 days of experience under my belt:1) Nice easily-portable camera at a low-ish price2) Power hog, due to inefficient GPS, big zoom, and powerful microprocessor being pushed by video, etc.I'll update this review someday when I have some durability information.Update: 4/27/2014 Took a nice long walk, shot 6 min. of 720p x 30fps video and took 101 L-superfine .jpg (4k x 3k pixel) photos. This used up most of a fully-charged Vivitar 1700 mA-h battery. I got a battery warn and shutdown after my walk while reviewing the video at home. The 1000 mA-h stock Canon battery would give proportionately less life. Canon says that the stock battery is good for 210 photos. A 1700 mA-h Vivitar battery should be good for 147 more than that, or 357 photos. That means that 6 min. of 720p video is worth 256 photos! I don't think anyone will be shooting at 1080p x 60fps much.Another way to look at it is the number of pixels processed per second by any of the 11 modes of the camera. The normal L .jpg picture takes 12.0E+6 pixels/sec (12 megapixels/sec). The least hungry mode S, takes only 0.307E+6 pixels per second. The hungriest mode is the 14 frames per second L multiple shot mode, which takes 168.E+6 pixels/sec. Since this is only in use for a few frames, it's not bad on battery life. The second worst mode 1080p x 60fps takes 124.E+6 pixels per second, 1037% of the normal L photo processing power! The 720p x 30fps mode I used is only 230% of the normal L mode. Remember, though, the single shot modes are on now and then, maybe a second out of every minute at most. The video modes are on continuously.NB: Good cameras with a lot of features have historically eaten batteries. I carry around a handful for the A1100.Misc.: I'm sorry to see the little A1100 get superseded; it was a trouper. Its biggest problem was auto-focusing at long zoom, which isn't a problem if you're taking snapshots in your yard, but it can be a problem if you see a magnificent vista before you. The SX280 shouldn't have a problem with that (manual zoom).

I bought an SX280 in May, 2013, and have now given it a challenging run through my local museum. It has a \"discreet\" setting ideal for this, since it suppresses the flash and all sounds. The camera can see better than I can in dim light, and it was able to zoom well for better close-ups of objects at the rear of a case than any camera I have used before. Impressively, it can move automatically into and out of macro mode as needed without my having to adjust anything, making it very easy to photograph an item and then its label without fiddling with the macro setting. The vertical leather case made for belt-loop use is less comfortable than a horizontal one, so it now lives in my old Coolpix case. The GPS feature is disappointing in that, so far as I can tell, coordinates are discoverable only when using the Canon software, which reads them from a separate log, so they are lost if you change the name or edit it with non-Canon software. The GPS was quite precise with some outdoor shots, but of course did not function indoors. There is no Bluetooth and I haven't bothered with the WiFi capacity.

It's small enough to fit into a pocket...maybe a bit heavy but certainly not unwieldy.  The zoom is amazing.  20x optical puts you in the middle of a shot even from 50 yards away.  I took some amazing photos of the harvest moon a month ago...could see all the details without adding a telescope to the mix.  Unbelievable.There are quite a few settings on the camera that allow you to customize your shot - shutter priority, aperture priority, white balance, etc.  There are also several pre-programmed settings for sports shots, night shots, portrait, etc.  I find that with those pre-programmed modes I usually never need to tinker with other settings...maybe to \"tone down\" the flash a bit so shots don't get washed out, but that might be it.I was nervous about getting this camera after reading several of the negative comments - most notably about the battery life.  Folks, it's just like any electronic device in today's world - if you leave all the bells & whistles on (e.g. wi-fi, gps, etc) then your battery is going to get sucked faster.  We took this camera to the beach this summer and headed out the door having charged the battery overnight.  I spent a full day taking photos, videos, playing them back, etc.  Even left GPS on.  I had no problems getting through the day...even after going back to the house and uploading the pics to my iPad via wi-fi.  So I'd say unless you are taking probably 200+ photos and maybe an hour or so of video in a single day, a fully charged battery will get you through the day.My other concern was the external battery charger.  Who wants to carry another \"something\" around?  And while it is still sort of a pain to have the charger extra, it's not really that big of a deal.  I just plug it in the wall and leave it there.  Then when I need to charge the battery, I just pop it in until it's charged.  Not a big deal, I guess.The quality of the shots are great.  Rich colors and great videos.  Even my wife who is a true point & shoot person finds it easy to use and her shots are (almost) always great.The pop-up flash is a bit of an annoyance.  But once your finger gets in the way a time or two, you learn how to hold the camera so the flash can pop up and fire uninhibited.  And adjusting how you hold it does not affect how solidly you are holding the camera.Definitely a good little camera if you're looking for something bigger & better than a camera phone (esp. in the zoom department) but don't want to be burdened with a big, hulking DSLR.", "Date": "October 27, 2013"}, {"Title": "Great Camera \"Except\"", "Author": "Les", "ReviewID": "R3PR5SO0G3KJ62", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "Got it quickly and loving using it \"For the most pictures only\"!!

Since I shoot mainly stills, I decided that I would simply get a pair of extra batteries (not Canon brand)and not worry about it, assuming battery life turned out to be satisfactory.  So far, I've shot about 700 pictures and 30 min of movie clips since Christmas, and it's working just as expected, getting many beautiful, sharp pictures.  During the first week I had the camera, I took a succession of sets of 6 stills, 4 stills w/flash, followed by 2 min of 1920/30fps movie with one zoom.  I made it nearly to the end of the 10th set (zooming during the movie clip) before the camera shut down.  Just last week, I repeated the test, and the camera shut down it in the movie clip of the 9th set.  I'm happy with that, so I decided to keep it.  My camera (bought about Dec 1) came with the new firmware (it had \"3\" in the sixth digit of the S/N, instead of a lower number) so I didn't have to do the firmware upgrade from the canon website.

The low light performance without flash is impressive (considering the small aperture and small sensor size in this compact camera) - it is surprising how many low light shots I take in AUTO now and the camera doesn't even want to turn on the flash.  Very often indoors, I can get sharp photos without harsh glare from the flash that just wasn't possible before - just have to learn to hold it steady and squeeze off the shot.  The anti-shake technology and low noise levels at fairly high ISO are really something in  this camera.The sharp 20x zoom is also coming into far more use than I thought - I had a 5x in the old camera that was good for prints up to maybe 5x7 - again, to get sharp enough pics at 20x full zoom, I needed to learn to keep the camera steady, brace the camera or my arm against something, or use a monopod or tripod, and squeeze off the shot without moving the camera.  Once I used a nearby broom as a monopod and that was all the help I needed to make a soft shot fairly sharp (in playback, you can blow the image all the way up to the equiv size of a 16x20 print with 9 clicks, if you want, to examine for blur).I gave the camera 4 stars for 1) the inaccurate battery warning indicator esp when doing a movie clip, and 2)having to learn not to rest my left forefinger right on top of the pop-up flash where it naturally wants to go - I am happy to report it has finally learned to rest on the back edge of the top so it no longer stops the flash from coming up when the camera decides it wants it (and thus requiring a power off/power back on).It would have been 3 stars but I'm really impressed with the compact size, picture quality and the price - I would have happily plunked down over $300 for this camera if it weren't for the above mentioned problems.One nit: I haven't found a panorama assist mode in the SX280 like my older Canon has.  I'm not into making huge half circle or full circle panoramas some cameras can do automatically, but I often want to stitch 2 landscape pictures together, and the assist feature would lock the exposure and focus and also help me keep the pictures lined up vertically with each other so as to not lose any more picture height than necessary during the stitching process.  I'm doing panos OK with this camera - I turn the gridlines on to help keep the shots vertically aligned but I have to go thru some extra steps to make sure the focus and exposure don't change from the values set during the first shot.  By the way, the included Canon stitching software produces fine hand held panos as long as the camera was held level (I'm a novice at panos - I wonder if there is any stitching software than can correct for the camera looking down or up or being out of level side to side - by the way, you don't need a level, but you do have to be careful).Conclusion:  It is obvious some users have had unusable short battery life when shooting video, even after making a firmware update, while others like myself are finding it satisfactory as it came out of the box.  I don't know if my battery experience is the new \"normal\" for more recently made SX280's, or just the luck of the draw.  If you decide to keep it, definitely get a few extra batteries esp if you might do any video (I got 2 Wasabi batteries with AC/12VDC charger on Amazon, and plan on popping in a fresh battery when we go to take a video of our great grandchildren), and also the Case Logic DCB-302 case (the 2 spare batts and an extra memory card fit in the side pocket perfectly), and your good to go.  I put the camera bag on my belt and hardly notice it is there.  NOTE:  For me, the Canon battery doesn't seem to charge completely when charged with the Wasabi charger, so I use the Canon charger at home and take the Wasabi charger on trips - then, after using up the stock battery, I will switch to the Wasabi batteries and keep using and recharging those with their own charger until I return home.", "Date": "January 19, 2014"}, {"Title": "Returning this camera that I LOVE", "Author": "jcpdx \"jcpdx\"", "ReviewID": "RXKSUWJ6U60JQ", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "This is the best point-and-shoot camera I've had yet--the optical zoom is amazing, the photos are excellent, the features a little complex for me, but I was figuring it out.

Why? Because I tried to offload the photos from a long trip to my computer, and kept getting \"communication error\". I thought the camera was broken. Some internet search indicates that YOU CANNOT OFFLOAD ANYTHING IF YOU HAVE MORE THAN 1000 PHOTOS ON THE CARD. It says you should use an external USB reader, which of course is not included in the package. Is Canon for real here? In this day and age, with 32GB cards selling for very little, 1000 photos isn't a lot. Merely telling people \"communication error\" is a nutty way to get this across, instead of \"Too many photos to offload\", or something actually useful.]Let me say that this is my fifth Canon camera, and I have always found their products to be a good mix of usability, features, and price points. The 260 came highly recommended and, when the its successor, the 280, came available, I figured it was time to upgrade my prior Canon. This was actually in lieu of the Sony RX-100, a spectacular camera that unfortunately only has a 3.6x zoom.The 280 takes very good, often great, photos, and the zoom is sometimes astonishing in its ability to pick out fine detail in what seem to be impossibly distant subjects.But this camera should not be sold, and it's utterly shameful for Canon to still be doing so. IT IS INHERENTLY DEFECTIVE, and they know it (or, at least, there is no plausible deniability here, given the dozens of comments on their own site and on Amazon about the same issue). There are two issues, actually: battery life, which is bad (but tolerable), and the fact that the battery INDICATOR is preposterously inaccurate. You can put in a freshly charged battery, the indicator will SAY it is charged, then, in just 5 minutes, it will flash red, saying the battery is about to die. If you turn it on and off, it will then say it's fully charged.If you think this is merely an annoyance, think again: it will actually stop your video right in the middle. It got to the point where it was stopping the video every three seconds.The camera, in my view, is therefore unusable, and Canon is knowingly selling a defective product. A class action should be brought against them, and Big Box stores like Best Buy and even Amazon, if they had any sort of integrity, should inform Canon that they will not carry this product any longer. It is sad that Amazon and others will suffer a slew of returns for selling this, but IN NO WAY should you even considering purchasing this.And, yes, I did the firmware update. It makes the problem somewhat better, but it hardly goes away.[Unfortunately, I took this to Europe for a long trip as my only camera, and cannot easily exchange it from here. Also unfortunately, I was a something of a Canon loyalist, but this is really beyond the pale. It's the last time I will even consider a product of theirs. This is not accidental, and they should recall every one of these at their own expense until they can produce something that is NOT OBVIOUSLY SERIOUSLY DEFECTIVE. Sorry for the caps, but I did want to make it clear that, if you are still considering this: Don't.]UPDATE BELOW:I may have overstated my case; I've been using the camera intensively for an additional week, and the quality of still photos has been often exceptional, especially using the zoom.The point of my review was to alert potential purchasers to the issue with the video's simply stopping in the middle of shooting. This has now happened to me three more times just in the last week. It's real; it keeps happening; and I, too, did the firmware update.I would also say that I've been carrying two batteries with me every day, and have had to use both every day. This did NOT happen with prior Canon cameras, and those used smaller batteries, so this is an especial battery hog. Let me be clear that I, personally, don't really care about that. What I DO care about -- and what I feel I made abundantly clear in the review -- are: (1) that the camera keeps needing to be restarted just to get the battery indicator to read accurately, which is merely annoying; and (2) that videos will often shut down in the middle, even with a mostly charged battery. This has now occurred MANY times, and it's hard to see how this won't be a dealbreaker for many potential purchasers.I suppose that, in the end, it comes down to whether one is hoping to use the camera nearly exclusively for still photos. If so, it's an excellent, if flawed, camera. If not, and video performance is important, I stand fully behind what I said at the end: do not even consider it.", "Date": "August 26, 2013"}, {"Title": "Really disappointed", "Author": "Goggla \"Goggla\"", "ReviewID": "R2Z04SMC77WGJO", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I was so looking forward to purchasing this camera as I have owned several Canons and this looked to be the best point-and-shoot so far.

I looked up the problem and found this complaint on one of the Canon forums.  It sounded like a glitch that could be ignored.  But after about a week, not only did the battery indicator flash, the camera would shut down while using video.  It then started shutting down every time I used the zoom to take a photo. I took out the battery, recharged, but the problem only got worse.

I contacted Canon and had someone stay on the phone line while I downloaded and upgraded firmware.  The reason I had a Canon rep on the line with me is because I wanted to get it right the first time.The Rep had me download the firmware onto a SDHC memory card via a card reader.  I was told to clear the cameras memory without the battery and the SDHC card in the camera.  I was then asked to close the door where the battery and memory card are installed.  I was then directed to hold down the on/ off button for one minute to clear the cameras memory.  I then installed the memory card and battery back in the camera.  The next step was to install the 1.0.2.0 firmware into the camera.  So far so good.  I then began to use the SX280HS in the usual manner.  I shot a number of photos and used the video portion on the camera.  The low battery light did not come on.  After about 10 to 15 minutes though, the low battery light did come on.  I removed the Canon 1000Mah brand battery that came with the camera and checked it with my volt meter.  Needless to say, that particular Canon battery was very low.When I bought this camera, I bought 2- 1700Mah Vivitar batteries with charger fromDigital Gojo and 2- eForCity NB-6L 1600Mah batteries with minicharger.I changed over to a 1700Mah Vivitar battery and the low battery light ceased to exist even when I used the video potion on the camera.  I continued to use the same battery for 8 days before I needed to recharge it.I next used an eForCity 1600Mah battery. I shot 20 minutes of video and 425 photographs with it before needed recharging.  The only time the low battery light comes on now is when the battery is actually low.  I bought these eForCity batterius mainly for the price.  However,  their batteries have proven to be a valuable asset to our cameraThere are only two things I do not like about this camera.  The video record button is right where I hold the camera with my thumb.  And the flash is in the place where I put my left index finger.  As far as the flash placement goes, I am learning to place my finger in a different place.  The video record button should have been placed further in the camera where the photo viewer is placed.For those people who are still having trouble with their SX280HS, I suggest they contact Canon.

I really wanted to like this camera.  I\u2019ve owned nearly 10 digital cameras now, effectively subscribing to the \u201ccamera-of-the-year club\u201d.  I keep getting seduced to wider wide angle, longer zoom, and especially better video.  I\u2019ve owned the two earlier models of this family, the SX230HS and the SX260HS.  This SX280 beats the SX260 with 60 fps video versus 24 fps.  Since I have a friend who keeps damaging my hand-me-downs, I can often upgrade for a reasonable cost, so why not?  And Amazon made a Smokin\u2019 Deal on this, for $200 including a 16G memory card.  I REALLY wanted to like this camera!I was on guard about the battery management, and actually saw that issue on my SX260 \u2013 false alarms about the battery being low, then with a power cycle, it\u2019s \u201cfull\u201d again.  I figured that I could deal with the \u201cfalse\u201d alarm.  I did the firmware upgrade .  But even after the firmware upgrade, it is SO much worse than my current SX260.  I did extensive side-by-side testing with my current SX260, which could shoot stills and 1-minute videos all day long on one battery.But this SX280 cannot.  It is not \u201cvacation worthy\u201d unless you brought a spare battery (or two).One caveat\u2026 if you don\u2019t adjust your zoom while shooting video, or don\u2019t shoot that much video, you still can probably still shoot all day on the one battery.  Just ignore the false battery alarm and keep shooting.  In fact, once I got the low battery alarm (after a few dozen stills and about eight minutes total of video), I shot a series of three 5-minute (!) long 1080 60fps videos \u2013 that\u2019s a LOT of video \u2013 before it finally powered down near the end of the third video .  But don\u2019t you DARE zoom in/out while in this mode, as the camera will power down alarmingly quickly.Unfortunately, that\u2019s how I shoot my vacation videos \u2013  start with a 25mm wide angle pan, then zoom in on something interesting.  If you don\u2019t do that \u2013 if you keep your zoom constant, you may very much like this camera.  You can really see the difference in the 60fps versus the SX260\u2019s 24 fps frame rate \u2013 it\u2019s much smoother.  And the file size for the 60fps MP4 is about the same as the old SX260 24fps MOV file (versus being 2x the size; that was a nice surprise).  Overall, it\u2019s an incredibly capable camera that you can still palm \u2013 it\u2019s nearly the ideal travel camera.", "Date": "December 14, 2013"}, {"Title": "Great point and shoot - works best with OEM battery", "Author": "lizmari", "ReviewID": "R1ZEDRJ64ICR8", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "After doing much research into which point and shoot under $300 (and without a touch screen) would be best for shooting mostly pictures and occasional video of my toddler son when I didn't want to use my DSLR or video camera, I settled on this one.  I already own a Canon DSLR (EOS Rebel XTi)and a Canon video camera (Vixia HF20), and I love both of those, so I narrowed down my search to Canon cameras pretty quickly.  I actually wanted to stay under $200, but eventually narrowed my search to this camera (less than $300) and the ELPH 330 (less than $200) after comparing the features of all of the Canon cameras below $300 and reading many reviews on Amazon and other sites, including several photography sites.  This one seemed to be better for taking pictures of a moving subject (toddlers rarely slow down for pictures), so I decided the extra $80 for this camera would be a good investment.  If you take pictures of things/people that aren't usually moving, the ELPH 330 would probably work just fine for you.I was a little hesitant to buy this camera because of the overall 3.5 star rating, but it seemed to me that all of the 1 and 2 star ratings were because of the \"low battery\" signal while taking video, and many of the newer reviews detailed that this was taken care of with a firmware update.  I have actually found that it might be a little less straightforward than that.  I have not yet attempted to download the firmware update - I will update this review after I do so.  When I bought the camera, I also bought a spare battery that is not OEM Canon (Digipower BP-CN6L Replacement Li-Ion Battery for Canon NB-6L for use with Canon SD770IS, SD1200IS, & D10 Digital Cameras).  I charged both batteries, and shot videos and still pictures over the span of four days: indoor bouncy playground and swim lessons with my 16 month old; a children's farm; a hands-on discovery museum; and plenty of pictures at home in relatively low light.  I took several short videos, and somewhere around 300 pictures.  I took most of the pictures using full auto.  I can't remember exactly when I switched batteries, but it was somewhere on the fourth (and busiest) day.  Plenty of other reviewers have commented on details of picture quality and other details, so below is what I noticed that I don't remember being covered in other reviews.Here is what I noticed right away:* When not using the flash, the camera can quickly take one shot after another* When using the flash, there is quite a bit of lag time between taking a shot and being able to take another shot - this is quite frustrating when trying to shoot pictures of a toddler* It is easy to turn off the flash using the button on the back of the camera (press the lightening bolt, scroll over two clicks, and press \"set\")* Turning off the flash also lowers the pop-up flash without having to turn off the camera (before I discovered this, I thought I had to turn off the camera to lower the flash, since you are not supposed to physically push it down).* The camera takes great pictures in low light without the flash (but they have lots of shadows and the colors are not quite as vivid, which you would expect without a flash)* The flash does not \"wash out\" pictures* While using the camera with the OEM battery that came with the camera, I did NOT get the \"low battery\" warning while shooting video* While shooting video using the NON-CANON BATTERY, I got the \"low battery\" warning when zooming while shooting video, and every time I tried to zoom after seeing the red flashing battery, the camera would stop taking video and display a \"charge battery\" message - I will be interested in seeing if updating the firmware will fix this problem (I will update this review after updating the firmware).  This was frustrating enough that if the firmware update does not fix this, I will be returning the non-canon battery, and spending the money to buy a genuine OEM Canon battery.* The image stabilization does not appear to work while shooting video - a few of the videos I took were quite shaky, but for a sub-$300 camera, that is okay with me - I have a dedicated video camera with great image stabilization, and expect to only use the SX280 when I don't feel like dragging out the video camera (quick videos while out and about).* The color is almost too vivid in still pictures and in video - I'm not a big fan of over-saturated pictures, so I will try to figure out how to fix this* The level of detail in still pictures rivals my DSLR, though the pictures with the SX280 are a little bit 'noisy' compared to the DSLR (this might only be noticeable on my large monitor...)* Still pictures and video using the zoom turn out great, other than being a little over-saturated and a little bit 'noisy'* It is easy to take video - you only have to push one button on the back of the camera, compared to the older Kodak point-and-shoot that I have where I have to go into a menu to switch between still pictures and videoI'm sure I am forgetting some things, but I believe I have hit the highlights that I noticed from the first few days of using this camera, especially things that I don't remember seeing in other reviews.  I will post updates to this review as necessary.UPDATE - INSTALLING THE FIRMWARE UPDATEThe sixth number from the left in the serial number of my camera was a \"1,\" indicating that I needed the firmware update (you need the update if the sixth number from the left is a \"2,\" \"1,\" or \"0\").  I found the update on the Canon website and downloaded the zip file to my computer.  There is a PDF that details instructions for installing the firmware update.  With following the directions, installing the update takes about 10 minutes or less including downloading the file from the Canon website and installing the update on your camera.  As per Canon instructions, you will need an SD card with at least 32GB of memory.  Make sure you follow the instructions in the PDF file for updating the firmware - I don't think I would have known what to do, or would have done it correctly, without following the instructions carefully.UPDATE - SHOOTING VIDEO AFTER THE FIRMWARE UPDATE - CANON BATTERY STILL GOOD, AFTERMARKET BATTERY STILL HAS PROBLEMSAfter the firmware update, I shot a few minutes of video using the Canon battery that came with the camera - I was pretty much continuously zooming in and out the entire time, and did not get a \"low-battery\" warning at all.  I also shot some video using the aftermarket battery - the \"low-battery\" signal came on as soon as I started zooming.  I continued to zoom in and out pretty much continuously, and was able to shoot about a minute and a half of video before the camera abruptly stopped recording video and displayed the \"charge the battery\" message. After powering the camera off and back on, the battery level indicator still showed a full battery.  My conclusion is that the \"low-battery\" malfunction while shooting video is only a problem with aftermarket batteries, and not with the OEM Canon batteries.  I will be returning this battery and buying a Canon replacement.  If that replacement Canon battery has any problems, I will update this review accordingly.UPDATE (1-1-2014) - Well, I traded in the aftermarket battery for a Canon battery, and while the warning still flashes if the battery is not freshly charged, it has never randomly shut off while shooting video and zooming in an out.  I have used this camera now for many hours of video, including lots of zooming in and out, and have been happy with the Canon batteries, though it would be nice if they would fix it so that the warning signal only flashed when the battery was actually running low.

My hands are not fat, but they are large and some of the buttons are hard to hit with my thumb. (6 ft skinny man.)And I'll have to buy spare batteries for the SX280. I get about an hour of use before the battery indicator starts to flash. I'm gonna try the Vivitar NB-6L / NB-6LH Ultra High Capacity 1700mAH Li-ion Replacement Batteries for Select Canon Digital Cameras, Pack of 2. [Update: Out of the package, the new battery gave me the flashing battery indicator within 4 minutes of Hi-res video and forced shutdowns while zooming. But, per my UPDATE above, it might be the new battery will get better with \"conditioning.\"] Whereas I can use AA's in the SX160.Both fit in my pant pocket just fine and it's easier for me to grab and shoot with the SX160 in a hurry.However, the SX160 is a VERY slow camera, not good for action shots. The SX280 is much better (faster) shutter-lag wise. I had set the SX280 for \"continuous shooting\" like I have with the SX160, but it was so fast that I turned that feature off. (It kept taking two pictures before I knew what was happening.)(Reviews say the new Canon PowerShot SX700 HS Digital Camera (Red) is even faster. But $350? Wait until it comes down below $200 like the SX280 did.)Image Quality wise, the SX280 is better at the higher ISO's. Images start getting noisy past ISO 400 on the SX160, but you can easily go to ISO 800 on the SX280.[Update: I tripped across the fact that if you select AUTO ISO, the camera can use finer gradations than user selectable. For example, the camera can select ISO 500 in AUTO, whereas you can only jump from 400 to 800.]Interestingly, when taking pictures of the moon (ISO 100), both cameras are the same. Perhaps a little better with the SX280, but difficult to tell which took which picture in a side-by-side comparison. Actually, lens aberration at the periphery of the moon tells them apart. [Update: If you back off the zoom a bit in the SX280, the f stop opens to 5.6. More light = less noise, and you actually get a better image (that you can zoom with crop post processing) than an image you don't have to crop at full zoom.]For reasons I don't understand, Canon crippled the SX280 for long night exposures, forcing you to use 80 ISO for anything over one second. Whereas you can use whatever ISO you want for long exposures with the SX160. So if you're in to trying to capture invisible comets with longish exposures and high ISO's, the SX280 will not work. (So far, I don't see a hacked CHDK firmware to change this for the SX280. There's an Alpha out for the SX260, so I'm hoping a CHDK for the SX280 isn't far behind.))In fact, since the SX160 does a prodigious amount of post processing on long exposure shots, the noise is remarkably low in long exposures. So you can effectively get more done in low light conditions with the SX160 than the SX280 here.The SX280 has a nifty wi-fi feature, which I set up to use as a hot-spot. It talks to my tablet using Canon's free Android app. Saves the cost of an Eye-Fi card, and makes transferring images to the tablet (for uploading to Twitter) easy. I can do same with the SX260, but it involves powering down units to move micro-SD cards back and forth.I wouldn't pay the current price for the SX280 and I'd be unhappy if I did. But if you can find it for $120, that'll pay for spare batteries and you'll have a decent camera, as long as you understand its flaws.", "Date": "April 9, 2014"}, {"Title": "Duped!!", "Author": "Rajashekar Pemmanaboina", "ReviewID": "RQHTKPTF1M4HU", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "Based on the serial number of my cam, I did not have to update the firmware.

Renner", "ReviewID": "R1TKABIQK5DUCI", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Like many other reviewers, I knew this camera might have major issues before purchasing it, and I bought it anyway. I have a Nikon D3100 DSLR that I absolutely love, and a Canon SX20IS that I always carry along in my backpack for those instances when there's no time to change lenses to catch that perfect shot of something too close/far away.I love both of these cameras, but there are times I shrug off the thought of bringing either one of them because they're just too clunky. Sometimes all you care about is capturing those perfect family moments. Other times you feel like you're missing out on LIVING those perfect family moments because you're lugging around your own weight in gear.Last month my husband and I went to a museum, a dog park, and an arboretum, and all three times I left the camera bag at home (gasp!). It was freeeeeeeing! But it was also painful, because people without cameras use cell phones to take pictures. Acccck.We're expecting our first baby in five months, so I know the decision between Capturing Moments and Living Moments is going to get even more difficult. I bought this camera to compromise. I wanted something small enough to fit in my pocket but that would still take decent photos. Other features I cared about (in order or priority) were zoom, the ability to take short (5 minute) videos, manual options, and RAW capabilities.I narrowed my choices to the Canon SX280 and the Fugifilm F7770EXR. Both have 20x zoom and manual settings, and they're about the same size. The Canon has a bigger shutter speed range on both sides of the spectrum (1/3200 to 15 seconds vs 1/2000 to 8 seconds), better video options (60fps vs 30fps), and better image stabilization (lens vs. sensor shift). However, the Canon does NOT shoot RAW photos and the sensor is a tiny bit smaller.Ultimately I turned to reviews and decided that IF I could get the firmware to fix the battery issue on the Canon, this camera would be a better choice. It seems like the Fugi has a lot more complaints regarding video quality, and even though shooting RAW is important to me, it's one of those features that's probably best left to my DSLR anyway.So I bought the camera, checked the serial number, and verified that I needed the update to fix the battery issue. You can check the serial number by looking on the bottom of the camera, and if the 6th digit from the left is 2, 1, or 0, you need the update!The update and instructions can be found here:[...]A couple of tips about updating the firmware:*It's suggested that you have a 32MB SSD card. This card does NOT come with the camera! You'll need one anyway to take pictures.*You will also need a computer that can read and write to your SSD card, or an external adapter that plugs into your computer.*Formatting your SSD card is different than simply erasing everything on it. The instructions explain how to format; this step is super important!*After formatting the SSD card and copying over the new firmware, I waited almost an hour before popping the battery and the SSD card back in the camera. This was because I was charging the battery to 100% (per instructions), but others have mentioned a \"20-minute rule.\"Before the firmware update, the red low-battery icon would start flashing immediately after hitting the video record button, and the camera would turn itself completely off after about 15 seconds.After the firmware update, I was able to take the following videos on a single battery charge:One 1:30 (one minute, 30 second) video with extensive zooming in and out (this was just a quick test to see if the firmware update had worked at all, which it obviously had!).One 26:00 video. During this time I didn't use the zoom at all. The red low-battery icon light started flashing at 23:00, giving me a full three-minute warning before the recording stopped. The camera didn't turn off all the way, it just stopped recording video.One 23:30 video. After the 26:00 video caused the video recording to stop, I turned the camera off and back on again, then started filming a third video. This time the red low-light icon started flashing at 1:30, but the camera kept recording for 22 more minutes.So long story short, there's definitely still something wonky with the camera after the firmware update, but being able to shoot over 50 minutes of video on a single battery charge is more than adequate for what I need. If you're wanting more than that, I'd probably suggest looking into pocket camcorders like the Samsung W300 or the Kodak PlaySport.Other notes about the camera:I don't like the location of the flash but I'll get used to it. I think it would be a lot better if they'd put it in the middle of the camera instead of where your finger sits.It's really difficult to open the battery / SSD slot. Maybe it's just me? It seems like I really have to push, and half the time I end up powering the camera on because of the way you have to grip the camera. This could end up being a fatal flaw considering how often I expect to change batteries.Battery life sucks. It doesn't suck any more than other Canons I've owned though. Again, if you're taking a ton of video, you'll probably want to invest in a compact camcorder that's designed to last longer. The batteries are removable at least, so you can charge up a spare or two to take along.I really love the build of this camera. It's made out of metal instead of cheap flimsy plastic, and all the seams line up really nicely. This isn't a camera that's going to fit in my pocket like my cell phone does, but it's small enough to fit in my husband's pants pockets, cargo pants pockets, or a small purse, and I have no worries about it getting injured.The pictures are really sharp. I have a brindle-colored dog and a black cat - these guys are my test subjects because the dog always turns out flat-looking (like a paper cutout) and the cat just looks like a big black blob if you're using a crappy camera. With the SX280, both animals looked great, I could identify individual hairs and everything! Obviously not as good as a DSLR, but a worthy compromise for sure.The auto-focus with the video is pretty impressive, even when zooming in on something in a dark room. Zooming above 10x got a little slow, but still better than I expected. I've always thought it was completely ridiculous to depend on a camera to take video (photo snob!), but with a baby on the way it's suddenly super important to have as many methods of capturing moments as possible. This is way better than I anticipated!The time it takes to power on the camera, focus, and snap a picture is fast. Like, 2-seconds-or-less fast.I've already purchased two spare batteries, a car charger, a case, and a screen protector, so this guy's a keeper!

Weeks", "ReviewID": "R33RV661UVTGR6", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "Canon PowerShot SX280 HSMuch of my photography is spontaneous, so I was looking for a small camera with good optical zoom that I could carry with me on my belt.  I was also interested in using the optical zoom to get better photographs of birds.  While there were many things I liked about the SX280 HS (the 20X zoom, good photo quality at higher ISOs, etc.), the poor battery life was not very good.  This meant that before a full day in the field, I had to be sure to fully charge two batteries, as one was certain to run out by mid-afternoon, if not earlier.For bird photography, one needs to use the spot metering mode, but the SX280 HS wouldn't be in spot metering mode after cycling on and off.  It would remember if it was in Evaluative or Center-Weighted Average metering mode, but unfortunately it wouldn't remember that it was in spot metering mode.Several times it would fail to focus at all on a small bird when fully zoomed in, resulting in missed shots.  I think the focusing system isn't sensitive enough to detect small objects.It was also difficult to use without a viewfinder when fully zoomed in.Photographs taken at higher ISOs were not grainy, but it took me a while to realize that the higher ISO photographs had substantial loss of detail.Since I don't print many photographs at large sizes, and most I just enjoy by viewing on various devices, I was hoping to be able to get 'good enough' photographs with this small camera.  And, indeed, during the two weeks or so that I was trying out the camera, I did get a lot of pleasing images that I couldn't have obtained without the good 20X optical zoom and the ability to use higher ISOs without too much loss of image quality.  But the low battery life, the occasional failures to focus, and the failure to maintain spot metering mode when cycling the power ultimately caused me to return the Canon SX280 HS.Also, there may have been a quality control problem - when I looked in the lens, there was either a scratch or a large piece of lint on one of the internal lenses.  I didn't notice this until shortly before I returned it.  When my next new camera arrives, one of the first things I'll do will be to look into the lens, carefully inspecting it for defects.If the poor battery life problem were solved, this camera would be very good for general use.  It isn't that good for bird photography, but maybe that is not that surprising - there are good reasons you see birders lugging around heavy DSLRs with large telephotos...Pros:  20X optical zoom  Good low light performance  Wireless  High-speed sports mode  Small size  Option to crop photographs inside camera  Ability to tag photographs as 'Favorites' in the camera  GPS - kind of slow to initiate, but pretty accurateCons:  No support for Raw files  No custom settings  Loss of detail at high ISO  Low battery life - in eco mode, the battery ran out after about 160 shots  Doesn't memorize the choice of spot metering mode.

It was in response to my daughter asking for advice on her next camera. I already owned a Canon SX260 and was completely pleased with it, but wanted WiFi to be able to connect to my iPad and phone.  When it came I charged it up and began to take pictures.  All was well, but when I called my daughter about it, she immediately went on Amazon and read all of the reviews that had a one or two star rating.  She called me back and said that she was concerned that so many of the reviews discussed a flaw in the battery monitoring system that caused the camera to shut down if it was used for video.  I don't use video, so I had never tested that mode.  When I switched to video, the SX280 began blinking the battery indicator in red.  If I kept taking video or even switched to still mode the camera would turn off after a few seconds.  It could be reset by powering on again, but if you again went to video mode it would repeat the cycle.I then did a search on Google and found that this problem began being reported almost as soon as Canon put it on the market.  A couple of months later they announced a new firmware load that was supposed to fix it.  Apparently it did not.  I read hundreds of customer complaints that their cameras just could not work if you used the video mode.  I contacted Canon and asked them if they had a fix.  Their reply was that I would have to send them the camera to evaluate the problem.  Most of the customer complaints had said that when they sent their camera to Canon it would be returned with the exact same problem.  I argued with Canon that they must have known about the defect considering the number of complaints, but they just ignored me and said that there was nothing they could do unless I sent them the camera.Clearly the camera is defective.  My guess is that it is a hardware issue and they cannot fix it with firmware upgrades.  Why they would leave it on the market without fixing the camera circuitry is beyond me, but I suspect it is because if they admitted it was a hardware problem, or if they withdrew it from the market before the next model came out they might be subject to a recall situation.I returned the camera to Amazon since it was only 6 days old.", "Date": "March 17, 2014"}, {"Title": "Not fit to be sold on Amazon", "Author": "Cruzmann", "ReviewID": "R1WWT3YAGVC6K9", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "This camera is defective and there has been no fix for the battery problem related to taking videos.

I eventually want to get a DSLR, but I'm not ready to spring for one yet, and I also thought it might be nice to have something more compact for those times when it's not convenient to bring a larger camera (and I'm a dinosaur in that I don't have a cell phone, no less a smartphone).  Reading through on-line reviews, I saw good things about my daughter's camera, but also a few limitations, and then I came across this one at around the same price and addressing some of the key limitations, so I went for it.I've only used it a few times to date, but those times have included doing some relatively low light shots with ambient lighting in coffeehouses and a bar, photographing musical performers.  The high ISO speeds and camera shake adjustments must help a lot, because I've had some very good results for the lighting, even when zoomed in.  The multiple auto-focus zones can be helpful, too, usually picking out the right target, though I did have some shots with narrow depth of field (due to low lighting) where the best focus ended up being on the microphone instead of the singer.Speaking of zooming, the effective 35mm equivalent optical zoom range of 24mm to 500mm is excellent (my old camera did 28mm to 200mm), and, here again, they must be doing good things in the camera shake department, because I was able to get very clear shots of small things zoomed in, and we're talking handheld shots, too, not tripod.  The zoom control is a bit finicky -- hard to move in fine increments -- but I'm used to manually adjusting zooms, and most cameras I've used with automatic adjustments are similarly tough when it comes to fine controls.I've mostly used the exposure mode that doesn't use flash or make sounds but does deal with automatic focus, and sometimes the automatic mode that determines when it should or shouldn't use flash. I'm not particularly fond of the latter in that the flash can pop up unexpectedly, and sometimes my finger is in the way -- I've had a few times where I've had to reboot the camera after my finger obstructed the flash's popping up.  I'm still early in the learning curve, though, and more used to larger cameras with flashes you have to turn on manually.I've also been fairly impressed with the battery life, as I've already shot three separate events, and probably somewhere on the order of 500-600 photos, perhaps up to 100 of those with flash, without the initial charge's having run down, and this was over a span of about 3 weeks.In general, the photo quality seems excellent -- definitely way better than my older camera, despite the point and shoot nature.

It doesn't offer automatic exposure bracketing which might avoid this problem (and will one day be available with the CHDK firmware mods).- No travel 20x zoom lens is going to offer wide apertures but this lens has a narrowest aperture of f/8.  If you attempt to shoot a longer shutter and narrow aperture to increase your depth of field or blur water or action, the camera will blow out the scene.- The initial battery indicator bug in video appears to have been fixed, but when the 4GB file size limit is reached, this camera stops recording.

Starting with a fully charged battery.  Took 30 or 40 pics, then went into video mode.  Did all kinds of zooming and everything was fine.  After a little while the battery indicator started flashing red. Then I set the camera on a chair and it recorded 20 minutes of video and then I picked up the camera and zoomed again, this time the camera shutoff.  I do have quite a bit recorded already.  The battery was surely part exhausted at this point.  I turned it back on and could do whatever I wanted picture wise, but when I went back to video it would work fine as long as I didn't use the zoom, if I used the zoom it would turn off.  So I wondered what would have happened if I had started zooming more earlier after I set it on the chair and let it record on it's own.  SO again, I recharged the battery and then started recording video right away, did all kinds of zooming and it was fine for at least 15 to 20 minutes and yes the battery indicator was flashing red soon after I started, but not right away.  I got quite a bit of video in and actually got bored and tired of testing and turned it off before it ever shut off on it's own.So this problem does not bother me too much since I primarily shoot stills rather than video.  If I plan to shoot video I will make sure I have a fully charged battery or have a spare on hand.  In the mean time I will wait to see if Canon fixes this problem via a firmware update.  I read on Cameralabs today that Canon has a firmware fix already, a very good review of the SX280 is there too, check it out.Update 1:  It was called to my attention that the battery problem is real.  I researched the problem and found a YouTube video demonstrating the problem.  I then tried to duplicate this problem with my new SX280 and sure enough, my camera DOES have the same problem.  During video on a charged battery, the battery charge indicator will start flashing as if the battery is about to go dead.  You turn off the camera and turn it back on and the battery indicator shows full again.  Start up your video and zoom a little and the battery indicator starts flashing again.  I called Canon technical support and they said I can send it in to their service department, but I said I don't want to do that.  They said they are aware of this problem and are working on a fix.  They are not sure if it is a firmware or hardware issue at this time.  They said it was a \"false Alarm\" and should continue to work until the battery really does exhaust itself.  I can live with that, especially since I do have a spare battery...  There is a limit on how long it will record video before it will stop on it's own too, so don't be confused it stops recording after it hits that limit, nothing to do with battery there...  I think I will experiment now that I have some additional information and see how long it will record video on a fully charged battery???  Hope this update helps for now.  See ya!I have been looking for the perfect pocket Zoom camera that meets ALL three of these criteria:Excellent picture qualityExcellent Zoom capability and clarityExcellent VideoI was really impressed when I viewed my pictures in \"Actual Size\" on my computer, they looked very good even at that size. The detail, clarity and color is excellent on all pictures. I have not done much experimenting indoors yet, but I'm sure it will do fine.The zoom performance is top notch as well as the video. So this camera met all three of my required expectations. I actually have another camera I purchased at the same time, but I am returning it without even opening the box to see what it does, that is how happy I am with this SX280. As far as the battery problems go, I haven't drained my first charge yet and have shot several pics and experimented with video a few times.  I just ordered a spare battery and car charger from Amazon, so I'm not concerned about the Battery problems \"some\" people have reported.  I think this is about my 4th camera I have tried so far, finally my hunt is over and I'm very happy with the SX280.See ya!", "Date": "May 21, 2013"}, {"Title": "Problems out of the box", "Author": "polbap", "ReviewID": "R3DLWQ8LFI6JW3", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "Red battery indicator comes on prematurely.

The battery on a full charge I took around 50 pictures and already it showed battery low. I tried taking video, same thing. Canon knows about this obviously but is choosing to ignore wide spread customer complaints and should issue a recall. Canon needs to admit this is not a firmware issue but a hardware issue. Whats the sense of a battery that lasts less than an hour of use? Google this camera 'canon powersot sx280 camera issue' and you will see. We are taking Canon off of our camera purchase list. We had better luck with Sony.This camera is also a bit of bad design. The popup flash is in a bad place when holding and the lens has no lens cap/cover. This lens has those metal looking iris type covers that hide the lens but they are easily moved out of the way and can be damaged just by putting in your pocket.Id like to say sorry for sending it back but the only thing I'm sorry for is the personal time I have wasted on this camera.

I had picked out this camera to replace my previous Canon Powershot SD1100, but then couldn't bring myself to buy it because of all the bad reviews.  In a Christmas sale, when my friend assured me I could return it if it just didn't work out, I decided to take the plunge.  I love the 20x optical zoom on this camera, and it takes really good pictures.  I wish I had had it on a previous trip to take pictures of wildlife, instead of my old camera with only 3x zoom!  There is an issue with the video setting and the battery, but I decided I can live with it, given the otherwise stellar features for a camera this size.  The issue is not as bad as some reviews make it out, because what is actually happening is that the camera acts like it is running out of battery if you take long videos, and shuts down.  But then you can immediately turn the camera back on, and take more pictures and videos, with the battery actually still mostly full.  I haven't had the battery actually run out on me in any day, even after trying to test its life, by going to the zoo, and taking lots of pictures and videos, and then videos of my house.  I got bored before the battery died.  I did do what one reviewer somewhere had suggested, and set the default video quality to the lowest one on the camera (which is actually the highest quality on my previous camera).  I personally don't take long videos (at most a minute and 30 seconds, usually more like 15-30 seconds), and I don't take videos that often, so it isn't a huge deal for me.  Actually something that does bug me almost as much as the video issue is the placement of the pop up flash, which sometimes will pop up under my finger, and then I have to adjust my fingers, and turn it on again to get the flash to come up all the way.  I have had the camera shut down while taking videos that are over a minute with a lot of zoom, but as I mentioned previously, I can then turn it on, and the battery is still full, and you can take more pictures or video.  So if you are like me, and want a camera mostly for taking really good pictures, that isn't too big, this is a really good option.  The zoom and all the options on the camera are great, and produce generally wonderful picture quality.  If you do want to take long HD videos with lots of zoom, then definitely get another camera, or a camcorder.", "Date": "January 26, 2014"}, {"Title": "Battery ssues the ultimate deal-breaker.", "Author": "SL", "ReviewID": "R3E38F3IZ76JCE", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "Absolutely loved this camera - pictures were crisp & clear, but the ultimate deal-breaker was the battery issue that others have mentioned.

Also features like iPad sync doesn't work outside the US, partly because the iPad app on the App Store is only available to US customers.Batteries, oh the batteries. Luckily I purchased 2 extra batteries along with this camera. On a typical day, we take a lot of pictures so often times all 3 batteries can be spent in a day.

Benenson", "ReviewID": "R17PALXFFBZ5VB", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "I really liked the previous model of this camera, the SX260. It did have the same industrial design issues (see below) but I could overlook them since there weren't any other problems. However, this new model has enough other problems that it's just not worth keeping; I've returned it and I'm going to try a different Canon wi-fi model.- Battery problems: Even after updating the firmware, I'm running into the same problem that others mentioned; the camera will show a full battery symbol until I start recording video, when it immediately shows the low battery warning. If I record anyway, it will automatically shut off after about a minute of recording. Turning it back on shows a full battery again, and it's happy to let me shoot dozens of stills without complaining.- Dumb design: When you're holding the camera, your index fingers naturally end up in exactly the wrong positions - your left finger naturally wants to sit on top of the pop-up flash, which means it'll often fail to pop up and you'll get an error requiring you to restart the camera. And your right finger naturally wants to sit on top of the power button, which is just to the right of the shutter button and looks and feels similar, so you'll often mistakenly turn off the camera when you are trying to take a photo.- There's no true panorama mode - just an assist mode that requires you to stitch photos together later using software on your PC. That's kind of silly at this point when even cheaper cameras from other brands have this feature.- Wi-fi is kind of clunky, it offers a lot of options and it works, but setting it up for web services is tedious- requiring multiple steps on Canon's website and with Canon's CameraWindow software on your PC.The rest of this review goes into more detail about wi-fi....If you want to have the camera use wi-fi to send photos to Google Drive, Flickr, Twitter, etc. or Canon's own similar photo-sharing service, you first need to visit Canon's website to download software for your Mac or PC to register the camera and set up which services you'll want it to access. The process works but it's a bit confusing and some steps seem redundant.However, you can skip all of that if you just want the camera to wirelessly connect to your PC, smartphone, another camera, or a wi-fi printer.To start wi-fi whenever you want to transfer some photos, put the camera in playback mode, hit the \"up\" button and you'll get a menu showing the devices you can connect to (and any services you had set up, see above). Pick one, and the camera will then ask you choose which nearby wi-fi network to connect to.If it's a new network that requires a password, the camera will display a tiny on-screen keyboard that lets you peck out the password using the direction and OK buttons.Once you're connected, the camera will let you select photos to upload. You can send the current photo, or select up to 50 photos - one at a time (there's no way to select multiple photos in one step). You also can choose whether to send them at original size or resize them smaller (two choices), which will speed up the transfer.The transfer seems reasonably fast and once it's done the camera automatically disconnects from the wi-fi.If you want to transfer photos to your smartphone or tablet instead of an online service, then it's mostly the same process; before you start you need to have installed Canon's Camera Window app on your phone/tablet, and have it open.Once the camera is connected to your phone/tablet, you go through the same steps described above on the camera to transfer the photos to your device. The Camera Window app displays each photo as it's downloaded, and it copies them to your device's regular photos/gallery app.The Camera Window app is very basic; it doesn't let you zoom the photos, and it doesn't provide any way to preview and select photos on the camera (that has to be done on the camera as explained above). There's also no way to remotely control the camera to use it as a sort of wireless webcam for instance.Overall I found the wi-fi features to be reliable and functional, if a bit limited.

I was also looking for a camera that records video in HD. This camera fit the bill for everything I wanted. I was worried somewhat because I read the reviews from others speaking of the battery draining fast, and the camera shutting down when recording video. But I was hopping Canon had resolved that issue with the update. This camera STILL has the same issue. I don't know how Canon can even sell this product. It is flawed BIG TIME. If you use the zoom while recording video, the camera will shut down after hitting the zoom button 2 or more times, and tell you \"charge battery.\" I thought \"maybe the battery is the issue.\" I swapped the battery with 3 different fully charged batteries, and got the same results with each battery. The battery that comes with the camera is about the most decent one out of all the after market batteries being sold for this camera. The battery has the \"Canon\" imprint on it. I bought 2 other brands from Amazon, and the other 2 brands would shut down the camera as soon as you began recording video for about 5 minutes. The Canon battery worked a few times for about 1 hours worth of HD video, as long as you didn't touch the zoom. As soon as you hit the zoom button while recording video, the camera shut down and gave the message 'charge battery.\" I was lucky I had brought with me 4 batteries for my Asia trip because I had to swap batteries back and forth in order as not to miss many shots. I still managed to miss some good shots, while changing batteries. The pictures it took were amazing, and when it did work, without shutting down, the HD videos looked very good as well. I was so frustrated with this camera I couldn't wait to get back from Asia to return this camera. Buyer beware, this camera STILL has kinks that the manufacture needs to work out.

Video, that's why. IF you can manage to take a video, the quality is excellent. But don't count on being able to take one. The much publicized battery issues are perhaps undersold. With a fully charged battery, we often can't take a 10 second video before the camera tells us the battery needs to be changed and shuts off. It's effectively useless. Needless to say, we've missed some experiences that would've been nice to get a video of. At this point, we're resigned to having made a poor choice and not being able to take videos. Every digital camera I've owned in the last 12 years has been a Canon, but the next one may not be. Even with Canon's alleged fix via firmware update, the problem has not been resolved. So, we're intensely disappointed with our purchase, but the pictures are great. Canon, if you read this and would like to make it right, that would go a long way toward restoring my brand loyalty.

It was by far the best camera for concerts if you're not able to bring in a DSLR.  Most venues allow these Point and Shoot cameras.I haven't had a chance to use the SX280 in a concert, but will be soon.  The better image processing and speed should make this camera just that much further ahead of the competition.Unfortunately, the WiFi features on this camera aren't very well thought out, and as such, I'm still using an Eye-Fi card with it.The problem with the WiFi is that it seems to have been developed by a marketing group as opposed to engineers working with the camera in the field.  So sure, the WiFi does 3 buckets of tasks:1) Share photos via email and social networking sites like Facebook.2) Sync photos wirelessly with your computer and the Canon Cloud service.3) Transfer photos to your iOS or Android device.So ya, those buckets hit the buzzwords just fine, but unfortunately, very little thought was given to the workflow of the device as compared to the workflow of the Eye-Fi and how people will want to use it.It's unfortunate, because the one weak link in the Eye-Fi is that it's not integrated into the camera itself, and thus always feels in various ways like it's a bit of a hack. So I was really looking forward to the SX280 and the integration of WiFi into it.Unfortunately, Canon kind of blew it.  The biggest problem is that you have to choose between shooting mode and transfer/sync or mode.  When you're shooting, WiFi is completely off.  So unlike the Eye-Fi, you can't just sit there and shoot while your images get transferred to your mobile device.  So the process is shoot, stop shooting, fiddle with the camera, fiddle with your phone, select images to transfer, wait, go back into shooting mode and resume taking more pictures.  This compares to the Eye-Fi where you set everything up and shoot while pictures transfer automatically.Hopefully Canon chages this in a firmware upgrade.Until then, it's important to note that this camera still is best in class (super zoom compact P&S;).", "Date": "April 30, 2013"}, {"Title": "DEPRESSING BATTERY", "Author": "Swati Mishra", "ReviewID": "RJP55T6NHZWVC", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "SAME EXACT ISSUE WITH THE BATTERY INDICATOR SHOWING LOW WITH A FULL BATTERY IN VIDEO MODE.

Lens is sharp. So what sucks?The video. If you've read any three reviews in a row here, you'll have noticed that the camera shuts down once the zoom button is engaged. The blinking red weak battery icon becomes ever present, and once the zoom button is touched, the camera shuts down after 30 seconds. BTW,  I purchased mine in November 2013, and it had one of the dreaded serial numbers.So I downloaded the firmware and upgraded. Did absolutely nothing.Then I called Canon. They were gracious and had me send the camera in free of charge as it is still under warranty. I got it back very quickly- within 2 weeks, along with a nice note explaining the problems with the camera and how they fixed it.Only they didn't. Same issues. Same red blinking light when the Record button is pushed. Same shut down- but now 5 minutes instead of 30 seconds later- unless you try it twice, and then it shuts down after 30 seconds. Really, Canon? Technicians?So this is why I've taken the time to write a review. Another reviewer mentioned that Canon was not repairing the SX280,, but replacing them with refurbs.  My guess is that so many have been returned they ran out of replacements and just send the camera back hoping you'll go away.  Well. I'm telling you- if you get this camera, put it into video mode with a fully charged battery and a class 10 SD card, and hit Record.  Let it go and see if the red battery icon appears, and also zoom in and out. Leave it recording for another minute, and move the zoom button to the right. If it doesn't shut down, I guess you're ok.

Send it back or wait to have a Canon Corporate Rep call me. \"How long will that be?\"  They will call you by later this afternoon. That was 2 days ago.I envy all of you folks who bought the camera with no problems. I would love to be one of you. But really- to send in a new camera- have them send it back as repaired when it is not- send it back again, and get a refurb that is broken as well-and then just say send it back again... I wished I had never had to find out how ineptly and indifferently the Canon service department operates.One more update 3/26/14- Canon made amends and gave me a new camera after I finally got to talk to someone in their corporate office.

Had the problem immediately while shooting video or just in video mode (the full battery showed up as red/very low within 30 seconds, then the camera powered down; when restarted in photo mode, the battery showed as full again).After calling Canon, I tried updating the firmware anyway as suggested, but it was the same firmware that came pre-installed on the camera. I removed the battery and SD card from the camera for 20+ min (as recommended in forums/another review here), but no luck.

The compact size was important to me since I found myself grabbing my wife's Canon point and shoot to take on vacation and family things so I didn't have to carry the full size camera along.  Another factor is the ability to take HD video which will replace an 12 year old Panasonic video camera.  I read that video is the weak point of the camera but whatever it does will be better than the old bulky Panasonic.Good things that I found so far:- Controls are mostly the same as our other Canon cameras which makes for a shorter learning curve.- Pictures taken so far have been really good quality with the default large file setting.- Auto mode does a good job of selecting the proper mode to use for the photo, but you can select manual if you want to take full or partial control.- Videos are easy to take with the dedicated button on the back of the camera.  No settings to make - just point press the button and start filming.Drawbacks noticed so far:- Battery life appears to be short.  In my first day of goofing around with the camera I drained the battery down in a couple of hours to getting the red  flashing light warning.  Mostly took videos and indoor flash photos so there was probably good reason for the battery complaining but I made a point to order a backup battery in case of emergency. What's strange is that once the camera turned itself off I tried turning it back on a couple of minutes later and it showed a fully charged battery icon and took photos OK but video gave the red battery sign after 30 seconds or so.- The camera has a problem with focusing when in the higher telephoto setting.  I turned off the digital telephoto setting and found that the higher settings are really nice and will eventually focus but it does take a short period of time.- The pop up flash is going to be a problem until I learn how to hold the camera.  It is located at the top front where you left hand holds the camera.  If you finger is over it when it tries to come up it freezes the camera and you need to turn it off then back on to clear the problem which will slow you down a bit.Overall I gave it four stars simply because it is so compact and so feature packed with some minor drawbacks.

The positives:  I've found the picture quality is very good and have not had the battery problems noted by others.  It's a very nice size and can easily be slipped into a pocket and carried.  I sometimes don't hold it very steady (see a \"hate it\" item below), but the image stabilization works well.  Now, the things I hate:  The video record button is located where my right thumb tends to rest as I hold the camera to take a shot.  So, many time now, I've started video accidently.... aarggg!,  Same issue with the flash.  My left index finger, while framing a picture, naturally rests on the top corner of the camera, on top of the flash. When it pops up into my thumb I have to start the framing process over.  If I anticipate the flash, holding the camera is not intuitive or comfortable.  Finally, I don't take photos with a phone, so keeping the camera steady at arms length is difficult.

Wagstaff", "ReviewID": "R6A7SVEWAYHWN", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I have owned cameras in the PowerShot line as well as DSLRs.  I purchased this camera to replace an aging PowerShot for everyday use for my family.Relative to other point-and-shoot cameras I have owned it is amazing. It is on par with my old DSLR from seven years ago. If you just want to point and shoot it does a great job of that.The camera is in the SX family meaning extended zoom, which it does very well. It has a maximum zoom of 500mm equivalent @ f/6.8. That is a pretty reasonable f-stop at deep zoom, especially when comparing the costs. For comparison, the off-brand Sigma DSLR lens for Canon cameras that reaches 500mm @ f/6.3 costs just over $1000, or much more for on-brand lenses. The picture quality isn't as good as a much more expensive DSLR+Lens set up for deep telephoto, but the results are still more than adequate for using on the web professionally.The camera is full featured.  The GPS and auto-tagging is nice for camping and backpacking, or whatever form of travel you are in to. My teens love some of the features like auto-detecting when everyone is smiling and automatically taking a picture, the wink-to-self-timer, and the miniatures mode.  Sunsets and flowers look incredible when 'extra vivid' is turned on.Now the down side.Canon chose a tiny battery to fit in the tiny case. From an aesthetic viewpoint this makes sense. They want it small, lightweight, travel size. They want it to fit in a pocket.However, considering the primary use as a travel and camping camera this makes much less sense.  Yes, the camera must be conveniently small, but not by sacrificing usability.  Recording video goes from a fully charged fresh battery to the camera powering off in about 30 minutes. Leaving the camera on while you walk a trail and take photos gives you slightly more than one hour of battery life.If you are going camping or backpacking or traveling without a battery charger, plan on going through at least one battery pack per day, possibly more. The battery packs are not very expensive (relatively) which is a good thing because you'll need them.", "Date": "May 11, 2013"}, {"Title": "HECK ??? Second one was worse ?  -maybe better keep your SX260 or ZS20..........", "Author": "Bears Fan Jim \"qm2-703\"", "ReviewID": "R1ZX6PWWNU9TIV", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "UPDATE 1-31-2014:Just tried another SX280 (tried Best Buy this time), as it has been a couple of months since the first one went back. This camera came with the firmware updated, evidently by Canon themselves. but the news is not good - I got the dreaded battery/video problem. It may be that on my first camera, I was able to shoot a 10min video because I never tried to zoom....as soon as I zoomed on this second unit, even with a battery charged 8 hous, the indicator went red and blinking on me.  A few photos and another attempt at a video, and the camera shut down. It would not even restart. Canon, what have you done to what was a very nice travel cam...???However, I fully charged again overnight, and I can now zoom w/o the problem (???). Will come back here in a couple of days with another update.Latest update 2-4-14:Bad...the video red indicator was back the very next day, and although it is not shutting down as quickly afterwards as the first day, I would not trust it past the city limits, much less on an important event or vacation.Everything else is about 4 stars. A great $189 travel cam, with zero video ability. Some engineering team should be cleaned out, lock, stock, and barrel. To say nothing of the non-existent Chinese quality control dept.ORIG REVIEW :==============My list of top requirements for an everyday camera, or for the lightest possible travel zoom, goes like this:Good to Very Good overall outdoor stillsHighest zoom that fits in a pants pocketVery Good outdoor videoFull manual controlsEasy access to ISO, WB, ev, multiple/continuous shootingGood indoor no-flash performance for restaurants, outings, and indoor travel scenarios.Good enough indoors thru maybe 5-power zoom video for concerts and kids plays.----------------------------------------------------------------------------The SX280 does all the above, but.I just returned the SX280 because:Video seems no better, which surprised me. However, my unit had no battery issue when I ran a 10 minute test on my tripod outdoors. Are other buyers fully charging, discharging, and recharging a couple of times before they run a demanding app like constant video ? Just wondering. Digicams are to me for video clips more like 3-5 minutes. Camcorders are for movies, where you set up a tripod and walk away.Flash performance may actually be 15% stronger on the older SX260.Stills thru ISO 1600 seem equal, but the SX280 ISO 3200 more usable in a must-have-a shot situation, ( I rarely would use either one at 3200 except to raise shutter speed and stop action).... Past that, ISO 6400 available on the new 280 is such a stretch that I'm not sure I would even try it for Facebook photos.Outside my house, GPS seems to require same time to acquire coordinates. I thought I would have more frequent use of GPS for vacation travel, to note exactly where shots were made, but I tend to forget to use it since it's not on all the time.PROS: A./ There is a noticeable improvement in shot-to-shot time.  Continuous shooting is very much improved, maybe doubled in single focus mode, and about 40% better in continuous focus. This is quite remarkable. However, continuous focus is not that well maintained when panning and shooting continuous shots.  B.1/ Still shots side by side indoors showed almost no changes in aperture, shutter speed, or ISO from what was chosen by the older SX260, but many times they did appear better rendered. It was not apparent on a 21\" LCD monitor that the improvement was constant in all scenes. Canon engineers are perfectly willing to sacrifice detail for overall noise reduction, that's a known fact. Maybe a good sized HDTV would show Canon's Digic 6 to truly be better in side by side against the SX260's Digic 5, but not my monitor.  B.2/ Now the good news: still shots outdoors are approached in a really different way: the new 280 will shoot low-ISO of 80 or 100, when the 260 model is shooting Iso 320 or 400.... The expected great improvement does not happen, but there is visible improvement in better shadow detail rendered. Why the improvement is not more, given the ISO difference, must be the processing, trying to maintain standard \"Canon\" color saturation.Didn't try to set up WiFi. I just can't see myself using camera wifi, when I carry a cellphone that will send photos and videos over WhatsApp so easily, and those are not bragging photos, anyway, most of the time just dinner and grandchild pics. Plenty of time later for SD card removal and manipulation to get the REAL bragging level quality of the kids' sports, candid street shots, macros, etc...CONCLUSION:The small physical size, quality of stills thru 3200, perfectly acceptable video, and nice detail in zoom to 20 or 30X, plus the improvement in shot time performance compared to the SX260.....All these make a very usable camera for travel.Particularly, if you do not already have the SX260 or maybe a Panasonic ZS20, or if you have the SX260 or the ZS15 and you want that WiFi and continuous shooting, this new Canon SX280 is certainly worth a very serious look. Short of a much bulkier FZ150 or SX40/50, this is the top game in town right now....", "Date": "May 7, 2013"}, {"Title": "Love it", "Author": "Yazneiry Reyes", "ReviewID": "R3JMJ0LY4LT4HH", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Love my camera has lots of features the price was great you can down load the cannon app to your phone and transfer the photo directly to your computer or phone with wifi love it", "Date": "May 29, 2014"}, {"Title": "Major problem: power button where shutter release should be.", "Author": "RheumDoc", "ReviewID": "R22SK31RGJUCX9", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "Ergonomically poor design.

A couple of recent reviews indicated that the problem may no longer exist.  I purchased the camera on 2/16/2014 and fully charged the battery before using.  For the first hour or so, I had no issues - frequently cycling between various photo modes and video.  However, then the issues began.  Just like other reviewers have described, the issue is not so much battery life, but the discrepancy of the battery life indication between photo mode and video mode.  The charge indicator can show nearly a full charge in photo mode but when you start recording a video it will drop to below half and turn red.  The camera did turn off on a couple of occasions due to low battery, but when powered up again, the battery indicator showed a healthy charge.Based on about one day of testing I concluded the camera simply could not be trusted and returned it.

The battery life isn't a great as cameras without those features because, frankly, just like anything else the more bells you ring the more juice it takes.

Lightweight, easy to use, and  they produce great photos outdoors - hubby likes to take close-ups of animals and plants, and this model's incredible zooming capabilities and better focus in low-light situations (shade, for example) have really helped improve the quality of those pictures without having to carry a large camera with a telephoto lens while hiking or backpacking.Our last one was the SD1400 IS, and it lasted us about three years and well over 20,000 shots - until it took an accidental bath in a river. I just ordered a PowerShot 100 HS to have as a backup. Since technology has advanced since we bought the SD1400, we thought we'd try the new CMOS sensor; and who could resist that much more zoom for only 90 grams more? Part of this extra-weight is from the built-in GPS, which we do not use, but some people might find it handy - same thing for the built-in WiFi.As a side note, I  have read quite a few reviews where people complain about short battery life; this was never great with any of the Canons we have had (especially in cold weather), but we always bought extra batteries and a car charger and worked around it. But for all the use this one gets (lots of zooming back and forth, multiple shots in a short time in temperature ranges from freezing to 100 degrees), battery life seems no worse than for the other Canons when we have the GPS turned off and take the pictures off the camera without the WiFi. And so far, we have not had the sudden battery depletion/ battery meter issue that also seems common for this model.So why only the three stars? We have had this camera for only three months, and I'm sending it in for repair because the flash gave up. This is the only model we've had with a pop-up flash, and I'm sure it will be the last one - it is on the top left corner of the camera, right where it's usually nice to stabilize it with the left hand.This one is fairly heavy to hold with just the right hand while zooming ... so to get a good grip, one either  has to hold it on top the GPS plate in the middle (which is somewhat awkward and partially obscures the display if you have short fingers), or hold it in the bottom corner with the left thumb making nice fingerprints on the display in the back. This might seem trivial, but if you have it set to Auto, the flash pops up without warning depending on the lighting (often, it will end up not even going off when taking the picture), so you have to make sure your fingers are out of the way.That said, even though we have done so meticulously, the flash gave up after only 3,000 pictures total - right now, the camera only works when the flash is turned off.The bottom line: The camera takes great photos, and the zoom is wonderful - but I would much prefer if Canon took out that GPS and put a built-in flash in their next model instead of a pop-up, like they have with a lot of their other compact digitals. This one is a bit too fiddly and I'm worried that we'll have continuous mechanical issues or drop the camera one day because of that awkward positioning.", "Date": "August 30, 2013"}, {"Title": "Very Good P&S;", "Author": "Liscia", "ReviewID": "R1LRNZIIH2X8OW", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "A gift for my wife which she finds very attractive in red.

The camera is definitely more than just a step up from using a smart phone camera.  The low light shooting mode works great.  The display is large and it is easy to preview pictures using it.  I also like that the body is easy to hold and on the front there is a protruding piece that helps your grip.  The 20x zoom is a nice feature.  The stabilization feature is fantastic; so far I haven't messed up a photo due to a shaky hand.I do agree with other reviews that the pop-up flash can sometimes surprise you as it pops up just under your fingers.  I have learned to keep my fingers behind it so when it does pop-up I don't need to change how I am holding the camera.

By the time you were ready to take another shot the moment has passed. This is not the case hereThe long distance zoom is incredible - hard to believe how far it goes - and really lets you bring to the game massive firepower in your pocket.The location of the flash, which bothered so many other reviewers does not bother me at all. It is kind of helpful actually to \"feel\" the flash protruding against your finger - so you can't help knowing it is being deployed.Also - I have not yet noticed any of the power issues described by some - I'm just back from a 10 day trip to the middle east and did not need to charge it once. Should be noted that I don't shoot video though.My main gripe against this camera, is really not its fault, but misaligned expectations on my part.It is unexpectedly big and heavy - when compared with any other point and shoot \"pocket\" camera. This is not at all evident from the online photos. Coming from the s100 I was used to the camera being not much larger than an iPhone - and in fact I often carried it in the same jeans pocket as the iphone.This is not the case here. The sx280 is hefty - and with the lens closed is easily 50% larger in depth than my previous camera. It is also probably about double the weight. It still technically fits into a jeans or jacket pocket - but whereas before I would put the camera in my pocket without thinking - this camera requires consideration. It is really more of a purse item than a pocket item - which takes away some of the spontaneity of having a camera just anywhere.So there you have it - I like this camera a lot, and not at all sorry that I got it, but I suppose there is no free lunch, and all this power does have a price - you should be aware.", "Date": "October 5, 2013"}, {"Title": "Great features - Battery sensor issue", "Author": "Hatem Sabry", "ReviewID": "R2JMGRK7SXBWZK", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "This camera has a ton of features, and the the 20x zoom in that compact form is just magnificent. yet the only issue with is is the battery issue.The battery runs out very fast if you leave the GPS logging on, but there is a warning for that.The other issue is that it would give warning of low battery even when fully charged if you record video and use the zoom lens.

I was specifically looking to: 1) Upgrade my video from my 4 year old Powershot; 2) Improve on the 3x zoom of my current camera.  There's hundreds of reviews already so I won't cover everything, just what stuck with me.The good:- Great stills for the most part.  Great movies too, even in low light.  I got excellent footage at full 20x zoom (on a tripod) of a deer browsing at dusk.- A solid feel to the camera.- Batteries charge externally. I have multiple batteries and I can have one charging while using the camera rather than tying up the camera as a battery charger.  Most comparable cameras at best only permit external charging if you buy a special charger.- The camera is still small enough to fit into your pocket (it may cause a shirt pocket to sag a bit).- I totally love the 20x zoom.  Strong enough to really get close while anything more might be tricky to stabilize.The bad:- The movie start button is right next to the mode dial.  Even though my hands are small, I would not infrequently accidentally start a movie and at the end of the day would have to purge half a dozen movies of my shoes from the camera.  The movie quick start button is handy but not right next to the mode dial.- The mode dial is somewhat small, even for my small hands.  Just about all my photos are taken in auto mode or program mode.  It would have been nice if these were next to each other on the dial.- Even with the firmware update the camera still has power display issues. After using the camera for about 10 minutes for general photos I would start a movie and not long after I would get a low battery warning. With the firmware upgrade you can still use the camera but you have no idea how much battery is really left.  Even if you switch back to taking photos the camera will still flash low battery.  I would then turn the camera off and back on and it would say I had a full battery.  You can work with it this way but it can get tiresome, and then when the end really comes you have little warning.  Frankly I did buy the camera also to upgrade my video capability and this issue really messes with that feature even if you can still take movies (kind of like driving ignoring the check engine light).- For me the lack of a panorama mode is a real downcheck.  I was in southern Utah and the Grand Canyon where panorama is a must. Canon does include Photostitch software for you to try to create panorama photos on your computer, but the results I had were satisfactory despite having learned last year after a trip to S. Dakota Badlands that Photostitch is finicky to use.  You really need to switch to fully manual metering mode so your different shots don't get metered differently, otherwise you end up with lines in the sky.  Even though this year I tried to get a lot of overlap between photos I still get a lot of distortion at the edges making it hard to get a good match between photos, and ending up with curved panoramas.  There may be a way to take panorama photos using short movies (especially using the 280's \"hybrid\" mode), then extract the frames and try stitching a large number of those together (I think other cameras do just that in panorama mode), but my older computer won't run the new Canon software.  Anyway, it just doesn't compare to a true panorama mode.- I never got used to the flash trying to pop up under my left hand.  In the end I just turned off flash mode (see exception below) but of course then I had to turn it back on when needed and turn it off again.  If they had put it in the center of the camera it wouldn't be so bad.- I like taking night photos, and they all tend to be large, distant things such as buildings.  Unfortunately the nighttime mode default is to try to use flash which is no good for a building 100 feet away.  You can turn off the flash, but if you powercycle the camera it will come back on.  Of course then you aren't expecting the flash to pop up and you get a warning message to shut down the camera because of a problem with the flash, etc.- I would get through about 1.5 batteries per day.  Of course battery life will depend upon how and how much you use your camera, but that was how I wanted to use it.  I was a bit disappointed they didn't last longer and was very glad I had 2 spares.  Initially my plan was to go a battery per day while camping and recharge all in motels between tent camping stints.  I ended up daily using my battery charger that plugs into the car cigarette lighter (I still have an old car) and doing it that way, though I didn't like using the car battery.  I was fortunate that the SX280 still uses the same battery as my other Canon Powershot.The So-so:- I don't need wireless so I didn't even try it.- It has GPS but I almost never used it.  GPS uses battery power.  Then too, I usually know where I am when I take a photograph.  There's times I want it and it can't or should not work (won't work in a car, I am not allowed to turn in on in an airplane).  I used it once on a back-country hike, but even then I knew where I was when taking a photo.I ended up returning the camera. I just wasn't happy enough with it to feel that was where I wanted to invest my camera money for the next couple of years.  I still have my old Powershot which definitely is not the same camera but at least takes basic photos.  Basically I was pretty disappointed on arriving home to have to resort to using the web to get decent panoramas to substitute for the ones I had tried to take.  I could live with the short battery life, but the persistent unreliable power indication is simply shabby work on the part of the manufacturer and I feel I should send them a message with a returned product.  It certainly crimps the video capability of the camera, one of my main reasons for upgrading. The flash position and the movie buttons were still an issue after 1000 photos.  There were a few other small things that I don't even remember fully.  Basically I felt I should be happy with the camera, but I wasn't, so back it went.  But... I do miss that 20x zoom!", "Date": "August 26, 2013"}, {"Title": "Great shirt pocket  pocket camera (with battery life issues)", "Author": "Jim Doty, Jr.", "ReviewID": "R294R3RCTHHZD9", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I concur with the other reviews on the quality of this camera and its biggest current flaw, the battery life issues. Most of the time when I head out the door I have a DSLR and two or more lenses with me, but there are times I want to travel light (I rarely need a DSLR when I am at the grocery store) and as nice as the camera in my iPhone is, there are times the iPhone just can't do the job.  So I started looking I for a true \"shirt pocket\" sized camera with a long zoom range and good image quality for its sensor size. I also wanted to have easy to use exposure controls as an alternative to full auto-exposure (usually aperture priority with exposure compensation or full manual mode). This camera was I chose with all of the features that I wanted.It GPS tags the images it takes (provided you let it find the satellites before you start pushing the shutter button) which is very handy. I can use the GPS tag from a photo and transfer the GPS location to images I take at the same location with a DSLR (the iPhone will do the same thing). Adobe Lightroom makes it easy to do this.This camera has Wi-Fi which I haven't needed or used. But it is there if I should ever want it.I miss not having RAW files that I can convert with Adobe Camera Raw, but a point & shoot with RAW files, and a 25-500mm zoom lens (35mm equivalent) would be too big for my pocket. Faced with a choice between a shirt pocket size camera with a long zoom lens and bigger camera with RAW files and a long zoom lens, I chose the shirt pocket size. If I want a bigger camera with RAW files, I will take a DSLR. In fact, 80% of the time when I head out the door, I have a DSLR with me.The flash works fine but the location takes a little bit of getting used to. It pops up where I want to be holding the top left side of the camera. This is far from a deal breaker and you soon become accustomed to the location of the flash.So this is my \"just in case\" camera when I think it is unlikely I will be doing any serious photography. The image quality is very good when compared to other camera with a sensor this size.As other reviews have pointed out, battery life is an issue. I carry a couple of spare batteries. Canon is supposed to fix this with a firmware update. Unlike my other cameras, I rarely find myself taking more than a hundred photos in a day with this camera. And if I do, I have the spare batteries just in case.I like this camera a lot and it is a fun to use. It is often with me even when I am carrying a DSLR.

Good \"Movie Junkie\"", "ReviewID": "RUDC1JOGFW65O", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This is my first, what I would consider good quality camera, that I actually did alot of research on the web for. I did not want to break the bank but wanted to spend enough money to get good quality photos. This camera is great. It is definately worth taking the time to read the PDF document that is available when you install the software that comes on the CD. When I got the camera I spent an hour taking pics and they looked good but once I actually read the manual and knew what I was doing and what the different features/settings/etc were the pictures looked super. The main reason I got this camera was because it got high marks for low light pictures and it definately does do great shooting in low light, I have been impressed with the shots in low light both with the flash and without. The built in effects are fun too (fisheye, toy, monochrome), I really like the toy camera effect it makes the pictures look pretty cool. So far everything is as I expected, the pictures look really, really, good, the zoom is amazing, the stabile feature works perfect, and the slow motion video is fun. The flash location does take time to get used to since my finger wants to be in that spot but it really is not an issue once you know where the flash is going to pop up from. I had to read the instructions a few times to get the facebook and wifi setup (probably my fault since I was multitasking) but once I got the wifi setup, the cannon app on my droid phone, and the facebook app configured it was definately awesome. I can't tell you how convenient it is to be able to view the pictures stored on your camera from your phone (using wifi and the canon app) and being able to upload to facebook (there is a twitter option as well as a cannon service but I am just using facebook since that is the only social media I really use for pictures). I really like this camera and think it was a good choice for me, and for you if you are looking for a fun camera that takes super quality photos. I spent some time researching megapixels as my first thought was to get the highest number megapixel camera I could afford, the truth is you don't really need anything greater than 12 unless you are going to print posters or crop tiny areas and blow them up (i do neither). What I read is that the higher the megapixel the more noise you can get in the picture which would affect quality, I'm no expert but I do know that the pictures I get with this camera are amazing! Not sure my wife enjoys me zooming in on her face, you can see every pore and every little wrinkle or fine hair.....its amazing!!! Whatever you choose make sure you research online at a few different sites and pay attention to the pros and cons. Most of the cons for this camera had to do with an old firmware which affected the battery indicator, the cameras released now have the latest software so that is not an issue. Another con was that this camera could not be managed via wifi like some other phones (remote shoot and such) I just needed to be able to view photos and upload them so this was not an issue for me. Another con was no touchscreen but since none of my cameras have ever had a touchscreen this was not something I would miss and not an issue. Below is a compilation of what I found after looking at reviews on about 20 different sites.Good points Slightly superior image quality to peer group Broad 20x optical zoom covers every situation in pocket body 1080p video with zooming, stereo sound and continuous AF Built-in GPS and Wifi Fast continuous shooting up to 14fpsBad points No touch-screen No ability to move the single AF area mode No remote control over Wifi, only image transfer Can't recharge battery over USB.

For instance, I was trying to shoot 1/250 with f3.5 at 1600 ISO so I could get a full zoom shot of a moving target where my flash was blocked from reaching the subject. The f stop was blocked from going below 5.6 at 1/250, so I had to boost the ISO to get the shot I wanted which ends up not looking as clean. I will also say this, remember this is a pocket camera and not an SLR, so this might have been asking a bit much for its size.5) Video quality is excellent.6) Battery life is decent and I bought these >(http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B008TX4I6W/ref=oh_details_o03_s00_i00?ie=UTF8&psc;=1)< batteries as backups and they have worked well for me so far.If you want a great POCKET camera, this is the way to go.

I have owned many other digital cameras as well from other manufacturers.  The bottom line on this camera is that it does take nice pictures.  However, it is not a quick point and shoot. You must allow time for the lens to focus. If you are using the zoom function, you do have to be careful to hold very still.  The wi-fi function is virtually useless because the battery life of the camera is so short.  The face recognition is very difficult to set-up.  The pop-up flash does get in the way, but I don't see this as a big problem.  The menu is not user friendly and you really need to study the manual to learn how to use all the different functions.  I really do like the images produced by this camera and have used it as my main working (I take pictures every day for work) camera since its purchase.  Now comes the problem.  I went on vacation to Europe several weeks ago.  I was so happy with this camera that I left by SLR behind.  After two days, the camera began to freeze.  It would take one, two or three photos and then just stop.  I had to press the review photos button to get the lens to retract.  Then it wouldn't work at all for a while.  This continued the rest of the trip and when I returned home.  I have owned the camera less than six months.  I returned the camera to Canon for repair.  They now have indicated that my repair bill will be $258.72 for a camera under warranty. Every time I have called to speak to someone about this information, they refuse to do anything until I resubmit all the details, receipt, address, serial #, etc.  All I can think is that they must be getting a ton of these cameras returned and they are not happy about it.  My last return was with a Kodak digital camera.  Kodak sent me a refurbished camera overnight.  That is the kind of service we should expect from Canon!  So, to re-cap, the camera is not easy to use, does take good pictures, but pray it doesn't break while under warranty (or after, if it lasts that long).UPDATE 9/18/2013:  After four e-mails and one phone call, Canon has replaced my camera at no charge.

So...having extra batteries handy is a neccesity. My theory is that there is so much functionality crammed into this small camera that there is little room for a battery of sufficient size to power it for very long in movie mode. If taking movies is your intention, then this is not the camera for you.That being said...the still photographs from this little camera are stunning.

It's faster on the stills (turning ON and shutter button reaction time) the 30fps video is great.Problem is no one tells you that using HD 60fps video must have extremely bright lighting and that your SD card will get used up in half the recording time.  The card is no big problem I bought a 32GH class 10, but the lighting is a factor.  I was indoors at hotel ballroom for a tournament and there was not enough light for 60fps, it was quite noticeable in the LED screen.  I shot in 30fps.

I also own the Nikon D90 which I carry to all my adventures in national parks. However hauling a DSLR everywhere is no fun and that's where this camera steps in perfectly. Having researched a lot, I decided to give the SX280 a shot and took it as my solo camera on a trip to Vegas.The camera did a fantastic job of capturing images in varied lighting conditions inside casinos, outdoors in the night and places with mixed lighting. Having used a DSLR, I know the images were definitely not DSLR quality, but they far exceeded my expectations. The night scene mode especially took some exceptional photographs in the night. Yes, the camera still has the software bug which causes the camera to prematurely display a low battery warning. In my experience, this warning is displayed only when using the 'quick video capture' feature in on the the photography modes and not in the dedicated video capture mode. A firmware update is out there to fix it but I haven't updated my camera yet.When I checked out my pictures on my laptop, I felt that the camera could do with a slightly increased contrast and reduced brightness. The pictures appear more vivid on the camera screen than on computer screens. This is however very subjective and for most people, this might just be the best color calibration. I was happy to tweak the brightness & contrast on my pics on my laptop. I tried using the manual mode but found it a little cumbersome to use, maybe because I'm so used to using manual controls on a DSLR. Having said that, the automatic, programmed auto and scene modes did a great job on most pics and did not really make me miss the convenience of manual control. It also has inbuilt wifi which I used but was not impressed by. The execution is clunky and it is not a feature that I anticipate ever using. The battery life of this camera is pretty good. I was able to get through an entire day with the battery dropping by just 1 point.In summary,Pros: Great size-features-price balance, good scene modes, great start time and photo processing time, very good image quality, very good battery lifeCons: Pics have slightly lower contrast and more brightness than ideal, some pics in night scene mode are too 'yellowed', software bug that causes the 'low battery warning'P.S. Also mad props to Amazon! This camera was supposed to be a birthday gift for me but the shipping company messed it up. Their website said it was delivered but I never received it.

I have a 35mm, but honestly I knew we'd be cramming in a lot of sights in a very short period of time, I really wanted a great point & shoot with no fussing with settings and the new convenience of wifi. I decided to stick to the $300+/- range for my needs, narrowing it down to a samsung, a Nikon (that didn't have wifi) and canon (which I had previously owned an elph). I even went into a big box store to touch and feel the cameras to help in me quest for the \"right\" camera. Reviews can be frustrating since basically technology may have evolved in some ways with new and exciting advances, but when it comes to the quality of manufacturing their seem to be many complaints. It becomes really confusing, and a bit frustrating.... But I finally picked the Canon, I'm back from my trip and this is what I think after using it for three weeks in 3 countries.First I bought the 2 pack of back up batteries with canvas camera case. The zippered case is a bit of a tight fit but did protect the camera in my purse. Though getting it in and out quickly became a drag, so during high use times I just wore the safety strap and carried the camera. Back up batteries though don't carry as long a life as the canon battery,  so I was glad to have two extra of the back-up brand to get me through my day(along with the Canon battery).The quality was what I expected for quick shooting, minimal adjusting. Good fairly clear pictures especially when lighting is at its best. The telephoto was impressive on this small camera, and I enjoyed this feature in my travels to London and Rome.I will say like others the flash when it decides it needs to pops up (an sometimes when I felt on the auto setting their was ample light) was annoying, especially because you'll probably have your finger there holding the camera.I also (and this was probably operator error) kept turning OFF the camera when I went to take a photo. The buttons are right next to each other, drove me crazy at first...again probably just me.I even unfortunately dropped my camera in the full telephoto open position at the Spanish Steps (on them \ufffd) and at first the camera was jammed an wouldn't close or turn off. I thought I had killed it. But my husband gently twisted the lens housing and got it to close and shut off. We were able to get it running and bend the big dent out of the front cover area. Though it's little shutter \"eye\" that is suppose to close and protect the lens stays a hair open....:-(But it kept up like a trooper through the rest of Rome and on to Dublin snapping away, so I'd say \"a toughie\".The wifi was a super handy feature while traveling, we had access to wifi pretty much at each destination. I was able to upload my photos to my iPad nightly, then email or use on Facebook and have my friends follow my travels. It was really a great feature to use with my iPad.I felt for the price and size (easily fits in your pocket) and decent quality photo to play tourist, without being one of those \"giant cameras around your neck tourists\".

Tough to see what you are doing if you are shooting in bright sunlight. If you turn off the GPS, battery life is excellent. Like most pointy shoots it tends to blow out the highlights a lot, so cranking down the exposure compensation to -1/3 or -2/3 is generally necessary.

These things lived up to my expectations. Unfortunately, several things about this camera take a lot of the fun out of using it.First, there is a persistent bug with zooming during shooting video. The camera tends to shut down if you do so and when you turn the camera back on it insists that it's out of battery. The camera will quickly shut down after much more use and won't revert to normal until the battery is removed. Sometimes this happens without even zooming but as soon as you switch to video mode or start the camera in video mode. After a firmware update this has gotten better but it still happens. I found a sort-of workaround by zooming in another mode and switching to video mode but this is silly considering Canon's reputation for quality cameras.Second, listed in the features is the ability to take high-speed video with your camera in lower resolutions. This is a big feature for me as I've wanted to experiment with this for a while. Sadly, the videos are limited to thirty seconds. This makes sense, given the demands on a camera to take such videos, but this limitation is expressed no where in the literature. I figured the drop in resolution would allow unlimited videos so it was a big disappointment to discover this limitation through usage. Additionally it should be known that the high-speed videos are quite noisy, even in well-lit situations, and lack detail. I figured this'd be the case (as I know a bit about cameras) but people without as much background should be warned.Finally, I'm a bigger guy with big hands and this camera can be a real pain to operate. It's quite easy to toggle auto-flash while using the scroll wheel and when you do so the flash pops up in response. Since it's natural to hold the camera by the corners the flash will likely be blocked by your fingers and cause an error needing a restart. This seems like it could eventually lead to a mechanical failure. In my first day of photography this happened to me ten or so times. Also, it's easy to accidentally turn the camera on while opening the door to the SD card and battery. These may be what we have to live with with these tiny devices.All that said, the camera has a great lens and takes pretty good pictures. Sadly, the drawbacks really sap the usability of this camera for me. I would have returned it except that on my first day using it the thing slipped out of my pocket and took a tumble on the rocks!

Add to that an excellent 25 to 500 mm effective focal length lens, high quality low-noise images, and a compact size that fits into a shirt pocket easily, and I've just described what I think is the best bargain I've ever gotten in a camera that I can take anywhere. I nearly didn't get the SX-280, choosing another brand first, but when that camera broke after sustaining a minor bump, I took a chance on the SX-280 and I'm very happy that I did, since the SX-280 images are far better than the previous camera (when it was working).People who want to see what the SX-280 is capable of can do a Web search for my name, and then view the images on the website that's listed in the search results. There may be a few professionals out there who would not be highly impressed with the SX-280's images, but I had the $2000 Leica X1 for 3 years and currently have the $1100 Nikon Coolpix 'A', and the SX-280's images still amaze me - in some cases even better than what I got with the Leica X1. The image stabilization ('IS', a.k.a. vibration reduction) works very well, and most of the shots I take at full zoom come out sharp. But I don't take chances either - I have a 32 gb memory card and I always shoot in burst mode, so even when hand-shake is a factor, generally I lose only one or two images in a burst. The downside of burst shooting is the time required to compare the images in each burst on the computer, to select the sharpest and best from each burst and discard the rest.I haven't done much with video with the SX-280, but from what I have taken the video quality is excellent (inspecting each frame one-by-one in Quicktime), although there is enough internal background noise (or whatever it is) that you'll get best results with the sound if you're close to the action, or the sound you're recording is loud enough to give you a good dynamic range. I assume the SX-280 uses AGC (Automatic Gain Control) for sound recording, so if you're recording something that's very low in volume, the AGC will turn the SX-280's internal microphone amps all the way up to boost the sound, but that also boosts the microphone/amp internal electronic noise. So you'll want to get closer to the sound (if possible) if it's not loud, and also be aware that the mics are omni-directional and pick up sound from all over. So if you need to focus the sound better, you may want to shield the camera on whatever sides the sound you're trying to record isn't coming from.Physically, the SX-280 is very nicely made, with a metal case that looks durable and doesn't have any sharp edges. I bought the red version, and the red case with the black trim on 3 sides plus the black wrist strap looks stunning. My SX-280 says \"Made in Japan\" on the bottom of the case, which is a big plus in my book. It's certainly possible to get a high quality camera made by a Japanese company that's outsourced to a distant location for manufacture, but it didn't pan out with my previous pocket camera, which broke with just a slight bump. The SX-280 doesn't come with a carry case, but it does come with an external battery charger, so you don't have to have the camera plugged into anything to charge the battery. That's especially important when you have a second battery, so you can put the exhausted battery into the charger and a fresh battery into the camera and continue shooting.Pocket cameras with long zoom lenses like the SX-280 require very tiny sensors (typically the \"1/2.3\" size) to be able to focus light at all focal lengths onto the sensor in such a small camera body. If the sensor size were increased, the camera would have to be larger and heavier accordingly. Fortunately, the SX-280 uses what Canon calls the \"Digic 6 engine\" (internal computer code) to get the best possible quality from the small sensor, and based on the image quality I was getting with my 3 previous pocket cameras, the SX-280 is way better. I don't see any significant pixel smear, which was always a problem with my previous cameras. Noise in images is tricky - I have ISO 1600 images with very low noise, and ISO 400 images with significant noise, and the apparent noise in the final image seems to be more a function of the lighting than the ISO setting itself.Camera \"On\" time is about one second, and it takes about 2.5 seconds to zoom from minimum to maximum or vice-versa. The mechanism is very smooth, so I don't anticipate any trouble with it. I would suggest being very careful not to bump the lens barrel against anything when extended, and even though I've done that with some cameras without harm, it's the most sensitive part of the camera because of the mechanics needed to extend and retract the lens as much as it does. The SX-280 has a dedicated \"Movie\" button on the back, which to me is a very important feature. I've missed getting a video started in time with older cameras where the mode dial had to be rotated to the movie position in order to start a video. The SX-280's screen measures 3-3/16 inches diagonally, but the actual image area measures only 2-15/16 inches.The SX-280 has a built-in flash, but that flash is strictly for users who want snapshots for social forums or scrapbooks - even something as simple as a quick copy of a whiteboard needs a bounce-flash to mitigate hot spots and the like. The tripod socket is metal (some pocket cameras have plastic sockets) and it's close to the camera's center of gravity (near the lens), but when mounted on a tripod the battery and memory card door cannot be opened.Camera forums are rife with complaints about the price of replacement batteries, and I always recommend carrying at least a second battery so shooting can continue if the first battery runs down. Contrary to what many people suggest - saving money with third-party batteries, I consider the price difference and if it's huge, I need to know why. Before I could even consider a very cheap battery, I would need several independent reviews that affirm the quality of that particular battery as well as the reliability of the manufacturer of that battery. On top of that, I would need to know that if their battery damaged my camera, they would pay to replace my camera promptly. Lithium-ion batteries can be very dangerous. If the price difference were less than my expenses in replacing a defective battery (packaging, shipping, time wasted, loss of battery for a period of time), I would certainly get the camera manufacturer's battery.", "Date": "April 23, 2013"}, {"Title": "Returning this one!", "Author": "GFS Philadelphia", "ReviewID": "R2FJQDP391UR73", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "Terrible camera.

My last one was a 220 SX. I liked the pictures and videos I took. However, it started acting flaky on indoor shots when the flash should have popped up. I figured this was a good excuse to get the latest model. I ordered and received the SX280. I was not happy with the pictures. When I fully zoomed out, the picture was very grainy. Also, pictures taken from about 20 feet away from the subject were not sharp. Finally, I got my act together and called Amazon to complain. They sent me a return UPS label, and said they would send a new replacement, and that I should send them the camera I was not happy with back. This was last Saturday. Today, which is Monday, I received it from UPS! I cannot believe the fast and efficient service. I tested the new camera with 20X zoom and other shots. They are all fine. It was a defective camera. I am a very happy customer. I was worried that I wouldn't get the replacement camera in time for the holidays. Thank you Amazon. I will certainly tell all my friends about your service.", "Date": "December 2, 2013"}, {"Title": "Still being sold with video causing battery indicator / shutdown issue", "Author": "cruiser732", "ReviewID": "R3TQ05GLT4BO0G", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "I bought this camera knowing some of the camera's had the video causing the indicator to flash and camera to shut down. Thought the problem would have been worked out but it hasn't, not even with the firmware update. I sent it to Canon Technical Support and it came back \"no trouble found\". I tested some more and found a SLIGHTLY uncharged battery caused the shutdown. So I charged the battery and it lasted 15 minutes with a good amount of zooming before it shut down. Tried again immediately after and it was down to 7 minutes. Each time turning it back on in normal picture mode the battery indicator showed a full battery. But video time was substantially decreased. Even used different batteries with the same exact result.I've worked with electronics and computers all my life and this just smells of something that they knew about but shipped anyway. I sent it back and spent extra $ and got a Panasonic DMC-ZS30. MUCH better and no known problems.I normally don't rant but this was a waste of my time.

I was so excited to get it because I am going on a trip and I wanted even better pics than my SX230 takes. There is a problem with that. The pics on my old camera are better! Much better! I particularly enjoy taking pics on old churches and museums in low light. There is a candle symbol on the SX230 menu that takes awesome low light photos. That function is now GONE on the 280. Gone also is the color effects where you could choose only one color to show up in the photo and the rest be black and white. Also on the manual modes, the F stop only goes down to 3.5 and it used to go to 3.1 also for low light photos. And the 280 is BIGGER.

My other camera's are dated with limited SD capacity and DSLR that is too big to carry on hikes.. Looked at a lot of compacts with long lens and manual controls. Picked this one because it was Canon and more important made of metal unlike some of many other very plastic camera. The size was nice also with reasonable access to manual controls unlike some of the others that felt just too small.After a month of shooting I'm happy with the results. The long lens is great, shoot some objects over a mile away on hike and came out very good. Images are mostly very good (at least on my Mac 21\" screen). Controls are good and access to those is pretty fast.  Due to the size some of the control settings are tricky like the mode deal which somehow i seem to engage unwanted setting while making adjustments--got to work on finger skills I guess. Oh yeah, the battery issue--I purchased two extra battery (cheap) and after getting red light warning one day checked Canon site and found firmware update. Haven't had any battery issue since that update. All and all is good camera that fits my hands very well and feels quality like an Iphone 4..

We wanted more zoom, more resolution, full HD video, small enough to always take along and preferred Canon for control familiarity. We still feel this camera was the best compromise.Overall we like this camera very much, but miss some of the features from our prior unit. The lack of filter capability *(specifically a polarizer) and an optical and/or Vari-Angle viewfinder impacts the scenic and bright sunlight shooting ability.Sports photography is compromised by this viewfinder lack and the camera freezing the action when the shot is taken, making tracking of your subject very difficult. The best work-around I've found is to use the high-speed continuous mode (@ 14/fps) which gives a more continuous viewfinder image. Just be prepared to toss a lot of shots to get to the good ones.While this camera doesn't win in the megapixels race (@12), it more than makes up for that in lens (20x + IS), high speed (6400 ISO, 1/3200 sec shutter, 14/fps), image quality (Digic 6, 1080P @ 60P, etc) and compact size.

I Took it to Europe and got AWESOME pictures & Video.  I dare say that the JPEG pictures were nearly as good as my Canon 60D.  But without all the extra weight, hassle and \"STEAL ME\" appeal of the Cannon 60D.And to prevent the theft of this camera. I attached a necklace lanyard made out of 550 Paracord.  I always wore the camera around my neck or looped around my belt.  Needless to say it survived a very hectic non-stop month in Europe. And trust me the pickpockets did try!I'll leave the technical details to the others who have already done a marvelous job of drilling down through the nuances of the technical matter.This camera works works for me. It works really well. It takes fantastic pictures. And I use it on a regular basis for routine picture taking.  But be warned that video drains the battery.  So be prepared to take short videos or carry an extra battery or two (they're cheap so why not).Try it you'll like, it if not love it.___________________________Update: Just got back from Peru.

Those that are affected are with the serial number listed on the bottom of the camera where the 6th digit from the left is 1 or 2. Well, I requested an exchange from the seller and a brand new camera was sent to me.  I was hoping I would receive a \"problem free\" replacement.

Other reviews mentioned a firmware update to fix that problem, so we thought that eliminating the reviews based on that problem, it would have a very high rating.We received it on Friday and returned it on Saturday.  It would turn itself off randomly or the display went completely black, and it sometimes displayed the icon for a mode the dial wasn't set on.  We did not try the video because these problems were enough for us to return it.We opted to receive another SX280, thinking we'd just gotten a dud.  Wrong! The new one came on Wednesday, and took great pictures and performed well, except for the dead battery/shutdown problem.  Thinking the firmware update would fix that and I'd have a great camera, I downloaded and applied the update.  Wrong! Looks to me like this model is a dud.  If we weren't paying for the video feature, we'd keep the camera because it takes very good pictures (Canon, knock a hundred bucks off the price and we'll buy another).

Louie", "ReviewID": "R1GYC8EZCM1UDY", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I own a Sony RX-100 and wanted a superzoom for shooting long range in good lighting conditions.  I bought a display model of the SX280HS from Target at a clearance price of $108+tax.It has an older serial numberof 0 for the 6th # so I promptly updated the firmware which was easy from the Canon website.  Unfortunately, the battery status glitch during video recording was NOT fixed by the software update 1.0.0.2.  The problem must be a software glitch that is not reprogrammable or a hardware design error.  Fully charge batteries seem to delay the battery low warning for a few minutes during video recording.Since over 95% of my camera use are for stills, not videos, the indicator problem is only a minor inconvenience.  Video recording still works fine for my short clips.The camera performs well for a 1/2.3 sensor, maxing out at ISO 1600 for a decent image.  As with most small sensor high f stop cameras, the higher ISOs of 3200 and 6400 are very noisy, and even at ISO 1600 the pictures are marginal at times.  But that's why I've got the RX-100 to handle low light situations with a point and shoot size camera.The optional shutter priority setting is great when you having moving objects in your shot or are zoomed in.  GPS works fine and locks-in even inside the house but probably drains your battery.  The ergonomics is average. It is harder to hold than my RX-100. Button controls are much better than the flat RX-100 buttons though.  The software user interface is intuitive.Overall, the camera was a bargain at $108 but for it's going price now of $188, it's still a fair price if you don't shoot videos too often.  If you wait until Canon fixes the problem with a new model, the price will probably go back up to the original $279 and take another year to come back down to the $200 area.  I still give it 4 stars because it is better than average when compared with other small sensor superzooms out there in the $200 price range.", "Date": "March 18, 2014"}, {"Title": "Great camera", "Author": "Matt S", "ReviewID": "R1N4GA2Y8E6J7", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I like this better than my iPhone camera, and better than my prior canon SD1100.

But, when I went to set up the wifi, I learned much to my dismay that wifi was only supported on Windows 7 SP1 and Windows 8. I had Windows Vista on my laptop and my camera could not see my laptop. (PC Tech lingo) This dilemma ended up being quite upsetting. The conclusion is I have to replace my laptop with a Windows 8 laptop so that I can now buy the ELPH 330 or whatever new camera that will be released by Canon.Canon was very remiss in hiding the fact that their wifi did not support Vista or other earlier versions of windows. On the back of the box it is written in the smallest print that Canon could possibly print this statement in, right under the statement saying virtually all versions of windows was compatible with the camera.

I have disabled GPS and the option for a small video with every photo I shoot.  I have only used AUTO and have put the lens right into a flower and saw the clear as could be.

Seriously, the camera is amazing, capabilities endless, size outstanding, but that damn low bat thing just makes me take this from 5 stars to 3.

My husband and I are having a baby in a week (eek!) and although we have a pro-sumer high-end digital camera for his use, I wanted something small to throw in the diaper bag and carry around easily to replace our older (small) camera.  Anyway, although hesitant about the battery based on all of the reviews, we decided to go with this model.I updated the firmware which supposedly fixes the battery issue and want to offer this tip: the memory card wasn't letting me copy the firmware update onto it for transfer to the camera using my Mac OS.  (That line may only make sense once you go to the Cannon site and follow their directions for updating.)  It took me a while going through tips online and find the solution: basically, some Macs have issues with the unlocked memory card so you need to move the Lock/Unlock tab on the card to the MIDDLE position and that somehow tricks the computer and solves the problem.  So, if you find yourself dealing with this same issue then move the tab and you shouldn't have any additional problems--I didn't!The quality of the photos seemed excellent (though we had it less than 24 hours)--the tracking was good, the photos were good, the low-light images were good.  However, it was extremely bulkier than anticipated.  The size and weight seems a lot different in the abstract online (and even seeing the camera in person at a local store) than it does when it's in your hands at home.  I felt like it would always be a chore to take the camera along when my main goal had been to get something small, small, small with good quality.  Plus, I remained concerned about how 100% of the professional reviews referred to a terrible battery life and didn't want to wind up out with our new baby and unable to take photos--the entire point of ordering this camera!We returned this and wound up ordering the Canon Elph 300 HS instead since it also has excellent reviews--I sincerely hope we didn't make a mistake but the size was the biggest deal-breaker in the end.", "Date": "August 29, 2013"}, {"Title": "The zoom is amazing!", "Author": "CA", "ReviewID": "R2OWR4W7QEGTOC", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I bought this camera without my usual thorough research because I was leaving on a trip and needed a new camera fast.

( I would not want to mention when time to use GPS.)  I really like wifi function but it was not easy to setup this function. It requires the specific software in the CD which came with the camera. My CD Rom was out of service and tried to download this software from Canon website. Unfortunately, it doesn't offer this option for its customers to download after talking to its technician . So, I had to find another computer with a working CD rom to transfer this software to a portable hard drive, then installed into my computer.

I saw the difference between these two cameras after I let him to take the photos of California Condors with my camera. That was why he rejected to use my camera in San Diego Safari Park. I hate to admit this truth.)  I used this camera for traveling 45 days with 9,000 miles driving on the road. Battery life is very important. It is really bad that I can't charge my battery through car charger with an usb cord. Canon wants you to buy an additional car charger. I dislike this idea and hope it would consider to make their products which can be charged with car charger without spending extra money. Pro: It is light and handy comparing to my canon 40D with extra battery compartment attached it . Its photo quality is not bad. Wifi connection is the best. 20X room is great. I was amazed and surprised by this function. I don't have to carry my 200-400mm telephoto lens to spot on someone playing in the water without clothes.

You put in the size plate you want for the battery you name, and they send the largest plate that will fit in the charger.  This happened to me several years ago when I was ordering ReVive Charging plates for a camera that used smaller batteries.  Finally I was able to communicate which plates were needed, then, and they were sent.  This time I just said - \"Go away\", and they will issue a refund.  I went with other battery chargers for my new camera that have a clear ordering page.The Canon PowerShot SX280 is super.  Better zoom, better image stabilization, better resolution.  Still could use better audio pickup on the highs from violins and the very lows from bass instruments.  It really eats batteries when taking long - i.e. five minute, videos.  So I have just ordered lots of batteries, like 30 - at great expense when you consider the multiple chargers so that ten or so batteries can be charged simultaneously.

I did a test with the Iphone 5, the Powershot, and my Canon T2i. Obviously the T2i won, but the Iphone 5 was a close 2nd (for what I was doing). The Powershot had pretty low resolution in bright sunlight. So I didn't even attempt to see what it's like in low-light, but it didn't matter.

I still possess a Canon Powershot SD1200 IS. The picture quality of SX280 is nowhere in comparison with SD1200. Even SX280 design is also bad.

I had no problems with Picasa and videos on my older canon A710.  The deal breaker for me and the reason why I returned the camera was the flash location.

Less than ideal for sure and leaves thumb print all over view screen.  It's almost like nobody on Canon design team ever even snapped a photo with this camera in low light conditions.As for GPS and Wifi, well the controls are so far embedded into the menu system I can't see these as being easy to use and I have given up.  I guess I also didn't realize Bluetooth was what I really wanted rather than Wifi.  I can't transfer a photo from SX280 to iphone 5 in field because I don't have a router in the field. Argh.  My iPhone has GPS, Wifi, and Bluetooth so why leave bluetooth out of SX280 Canon?The SX280 also needs a touch screen to make menu selections logical. I know I paid way more for my iPhone 5, but I also like it way more. The iPhone 5 came with 32 Gig of memory preinstalled rather than no memory at all like this SX280 requiring me to make a trip to the local Walmart to get $30 memory card.About the only thing I can do on this point and shoot camera that I can't already do on my iPhone 5 is optical zoom and I am not sure that functionality alone is worth keeping this superficially desireable purchase just for that feature.The battery is also a problem in that I can't use off-the-shelf AA  lithium batteries from Walmart or Walgreens etc. like I do with my last Canon camera. I would really rather have a larger camera body with room for AA replaceable batteries and a place to hold the camera.My complaint with Canon's menu design is that it changes depending on whether I turn the camera on with the ON/OFF button or with the Blue right arrow in a blue box button.  If you use the ON/OFF button followed by Menu button you get two categories: Camera icon and Tools icon.  But if you use the Blue Arrow button followed by the Menu button you get three categories: Blue Arrow icon, Print icon, and Tools icon.  This is confusing.
