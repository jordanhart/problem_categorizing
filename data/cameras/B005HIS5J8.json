I found a few diffent ones but ended up desiding on this set.  From what I seen it's the best set for the money.  I got my package within a few days.  Everything was packaged well.

The camera's smarter than I am and while I've used mostly the auto mode I've also been playing with other modes and options and gotten some great shots.  The transition to digital SLR from an older Pentax SLR has been easy.  The package deal provided virtually everything I need as an amateur, and the quality of the pieces is certainly acceptable, especially at the price.

All items are brand new (not refurbished, or anything). I've already took more then two thousand pictures with this camera and lenses. Worth every penny.

I can't explain it, but I've got the package ON THE NEXT DAY after I've placed an order on Amazon.

The camera of course is really good, it may be an earlier model but it does the job. I'm using it for film making mostly, and it has treated me really well. As for the 300mm lens, it works really well when shooting at 60fps, and capturing slow motion. Smooth and natural. The rest of the bundle pack has been great. No complaints as of yet.

This kit is a great kit for a beginning photographer.  I didn't care for the carrying bag that came with it.  Within a month, the interior had already ripped.  It was cumbersome and finding stuff stored in it was difficult.  I am still using the Tripod and really like the features.  It has many adjustments to get the perfect angle on your shots and bubble levels make it easy to tell if the camera is straight.", "Date": "April 10, 2013"}, {"Title": "Enjoying this upgrade from my Canon Powershot SX", "Author": "Shawn Sumpter", "ReviewID": "R147TTSU77I95J", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I loved my Canon Powershot and its predicessor.  My husband's camera died and I got to upgrade so he could have my hand-me-down.  I figured it was time to go full DSLR.This was an easy upgrade.  Most of the controls are the same or similar to the Powershot series and the automatic settings are a no brainer.  That means I was able to take the camera out of the box and immediately start taking pictures.  Decent pictures.  I am not an expert by any means but need to be able to take pictures of college level running events. Very happy with the performance.  I originally intended to get the package with the 55-250 IS lens but clicked the wrong item on my wish list.  I was concerned that I might not be steady enough without the lens stabilization at full zoom without using a tripod (not always able to at a meet).  I am happy with the results of the non-IS lens.The camera feels good and is comfortable to use over an extended hand held time even with the large zoom lens attached.The product description was not clear but this package did include two batteries total.  One with the camera and one additional as a part of the package.  Very ahppy about that.  So far I have taken about 500 pictures.  I do not leave the view screen on by default but I do tend to do a lot of revie/playback periodically during an event to see if I am really getting what I think I am getting. Still working on the original full battery charge. Very, very happy about that!", "Date": "March 19, 2013"}, {"Title": "awesome starter package.", "Author": "martin rostami", "ReviewID": "R3RKT98UF448N", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "got this package because compared to other bundles that I researched it was the most bang for the buck. compared to costco and best buy, you have everything you need all in one and more. shipping to a little longer than expected because it was going from east coast to west coast. but without a doubt awesome package for the price.", "Date": "March 8, 2013"}, {"Title": "Great Camera", "Author": "Gabriella Hoiland", "ReviewID": "R20CLEXP5GWV0O", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I love this camera.ProsIt's fast.
