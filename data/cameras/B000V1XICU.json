It offers excellent image quality, a large vivid LCD display, intelligent defaults, fine low-light sensitivity, a high quality movie mode (with sound), an outstanding wide-angle lens and (most importantly for me) a photo capture speed that leaves many other digital cameras in the dust.I cover a fair amount of electronics trade shows such as CES and CEDIA for my home theater site (Big Picture Big Sound), so I need a camera that is quick on the draw, has a good macro feature for close-ups, and has good low light sensitivity and zoom for distance shots at press conferences.  But portability is also key, as I need to carry the camera around in my pocket along with other gadgets for note-taking.  I've owned a Canon S400 Digital Elph for a number of years, and it has served me well, but the lag time between pushing the shutter button and actually getting a picture (particularly indoors) was frustrating, and the low light sensitivity is also fairly poor.The SD870 retains all of the positive features of the earlier ELPH models, yet improves on the weaknesses.  You can go from power up to pictures snapped in about a second.  And once the camera is powered up and ready, you can capture shots in 1/2 second or less (depending on lighting conditions).  For taking pictures in low lighting, the \"Night Scene\" mode (along with built-in optical image stabilization) is excellent, enabling me to capture on-stage action at a press event from 20 or 30 feet away (ISO sensitivity on the camera goes all the way up to 1600, but you can expect some graininess when the camera goes above ISO 400).  Other scene modes such as \"portrait\" are also handy when you're going in for a close-up shot and want to capture a posed or candid pic of a loved one with an \"artistic\" out-of-focus background.In terms of size, the camera is very small, yet comfortable in the hand.  The camera's aluminum frame feels solid without being weighty and controls are logically laid out so you can be up and running without cracking the manual.  Unfortunately the small size means it does not take standard AA batteries, but the Lithium Ion battery that comes with it will last through a couple of hundred shots in normal use.  You will want to buy a spare battery however, as there is not always a lot of warning between when the on-screen low battery indicator starts flashing and the camera powers itself down (hint, get the Lenmar NB-5L equivalent - it will last about as long as the Canon for about 1/3 the price).All in all, I'm very pleased with my purchase of the SD870 IS and am looking forward to using it to snap high quality pics of the latest gadgets at next year's Consumer Electronics Show.Update (2/23/08) - Coming home from a party one night, I was mortified to find that the SD870 lens was halfway extended inside its case, inside my pocket.  Apparently the power button was activated while inside my pocket and the lens motor has no safety so it tried to extend itself and the mechanism broke when it met resistance.  So the lens would no longer fully extend and the image was perpetually out of focus.  Sending it to Canon, I got a letter back saying it would cost $100 (flat fee) to repair even though it was under warranty.  I argued that the camera was not abused or dropped and eventually they relented and covered the repair.However this design flaw in the lens motor would lower my score of the camera to 4 stars if I could edit the score.  What good is a portable camera that can't be carried inside a pocket?  My advice would be to take the battery out if you're going to pack this inside luggage or transport it somewhere it could be jostled about.  And I hope Canon addresses this with a safety retract mechanism (or a recessed power button) in future models.", "Date": "October 16, 2007"}, {"Title": "Canon's best ELPH yet !!!", "Author": "gweempose", "ReviewID": "R1LXXQFU51D0YF", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This camera replaced my trusty SD450. I loved the SD450, but I wanted to upgrade to something with image stabilization. To put it simply, the SD870 totally rocks! The 3\" screen is beautiful to behold. It's even viewable outside with bright sunlight shining directly on it. And the pictures this thing takes are absolutely gorgeous! They are sharp as a tack, and the colors are spot on. I have to say, the image stabilization really makes a big difference, particularly when you are shooting in low light. I also like the new, wide-angle lens. It really comes in handy when taking group shots or shooting in close quarters.The only negative I can come up with is the lack of an optical viewfinder.

I've had the 870 for a month and it's performed well in both dark rooms and in bright outdoor light. The shutter delay in daylight shots is negligible and a big improvement over previous cameras. The movie function is also pretty cool. Battery life is great and the intuitive menu and symbols on the large LCD don't require magnifying glasses to read. But my favorite feature is the wide angle lens--the advantage was really obvious when comparing group shots from other point-and-shoot ultracompacts at 2 birthday parties. My only disappointment are the flimsy plastic doors for the battery and USB port (why I only give it 4 stars). These items are what broke on my Optio S and forced me to retire it after 2 years of light use. I'll be babying these doors with the hope that I don't lose my $400 investment in the near-term....

If you are strapped for cash, you can opt for the SD800 which is similar but not the same. The SD800 is a smudge heavier, while having a smaller LCD. Image quality on the SD870 is on par with the 850, which in my humble opinion is pretty damn good. Despite the nay sayers, IQ is better than the 800. Barrel distortion/\"soft corners\" are present, as they are in all the p&s; cameras with 28 mm, but it is hardly noticeable. They finally did away with the image finder as well. Why do consumers need it anyways? The 3 inch lcd is just beautiful to look at, and for all intents and purposes of a camera like this, it does a great job.The thing is lighter than it's predecessors, but definitely not worse in build quality. They used heavy duty blast type plastic to reinforce everything. The thing is light. It's small. It's definitely easy to use. Image quality is great for a ultra compact.

When I decided to buy a new one, I looked at the A series again because the picture quality from these cameras is amazing. At the last minute I decided on the Elph series because I find that the more portable the camera, the more likely I am to use it, and the more I use it, the more likely I am going to get excellent pictures. This year's model does not have a viewfinder, but I *never* used the viewfinder on my A series. This one has a bright, big LCD that is easy to see even in direct sunlight. On the downside, you will still get fuzzy images when the camera is fully zoomed out. It has an image stabilizer, but I still get fuzzy images, even with what I think is a steady hand. I suggest you take one or two extra images when zoomed out to make sure one is clear. A couple of times I have had the message \"memory card error\" pop up on the screen. If I turn the camera off and on, it seems to fix it.

First off, it is a point-and-shoot camera, so no matter what company or model you buy there is going to be a trade off for the size of the camera.  I have tested the Canon SD950, SD750 and the Sony T-200.  The Sony was cosmetically the coolest looking camera, but the picture quality was nowhere near any of the Canons.  The SD950 was bigger and bulkier than the other Canons and 12MP is overkill for a point-and-shoot.  I narrowed it down between the SD750 and the SD870.  The 750 is a little smaller and lighter than the 870, and the 870 has an extra mega pixel, image stabilization and a little more optical zoom. However, the wide angle lens on the 870 made it an easy choice in my opinion.  The 870 will fit in you pocket and take excellent quality pics.", "Date": "November 30, 2007"}, {"Title": "I bought two of these and they are a hit!", "Author": "Manish Laxmikant", "ReviewID": "R35011TAL8W9DK", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Cameras typically boast 10x, 12x, 18x optical zoom and that's fine for birdwatching and the like (no don't take portraits with that unless you like flat faces) but few point-and-shoot cameras offer a 28mm-equivalent wide angle lens, with Image Stabilization to boot.Buy this with a spare lenmar NB-5L equivalent battery, and a good capacity SD card - at least 2GB, and you won't be sorry at all. The 28mm wide lens can take excellent indoor shots.Wide lenses bring in more light so you're more likely to get pictures at better ISO settings (less grainy) and the IS capability allows you yet a lower shutter speed since shake is eliminated.With the massive 3\" screen, you can pretty much view the shot as it will appear on your computer or in a print, and the 4x6 bars as well as the gridlines will assist you in getting nice printable 4\"x6\" shots. You won't miss the optical viewfinder. People complain, but I've never used the optical viewfinder when I've had this huge screen. Remember, the medium format Hasselblads boast of allowing you to look at your shot with both eyes and not force you to squint through a small hole. The spare battery will make up for any power consumed by the LCD.A small room, a scenic view, people shots (especially if you don't want to get your subject conscious by pointing at him or her) all are possible with the wide view - the focus is intelligent enough to catch off-center subjects.I particularly like IS for getting those artistic blurs. Normally if you take a picture with a low shutter speed, there's the blur from subject movement, and the blur from your camera shaking. Eliminate the camera shaking blur and you get wonderful, artistic motion captured in a still. A street in a busy city, with people moving and blurring just enough to suggest motion.The diminutive size of the elphs helps in keeping them highly portable, always accessible (by the time you pull your DSLR out, your shot is gone) and the wide angle and IS features only make this camera well worth its modest price. 8MP is much more than enough, you don't need to squeeze more pixels than you will ever use. At 300dpi, an 8 MP image will get you a good poster print without a problem. The full-screen (640x480, 30fps) video capture rivals that of a decent camcorder, except you've already got your clip while your camcorder is still awaiting fumbling in your bag.Suggestions: Don't use the flash in low light. Make do with IS and push ISO to 200 and you will still love the pictures. Turn off red-eye flash and digital zoom, both are bad ideas. Any computer can correct red-eye, which is better than using the blinking red-eye flash that renders subjects blind. Digital zoom? You can crop and enlarge on the download and storage software (e.g. iPhoto) instead of forever pixelating (= ruining) your image inside the camera.", "Date": "May 20, 2008"}, {"Title": "In some ways excellent, in others poor", "Author": "Davey Williams \"davey williams\"", "ReviewID": "R3K6LKOPDGS6FS", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "I recently purchased the sd870is for a vacation, based largely on the moderately good reviews that it gets. During my two weeks with the camera, I found it in some ways to perform better than any other digital camera I have ever used, and in some ways to perform very poorly.Let's start with the good. Any shots in very bright light turned out great using both the manual settings and the camera's automatic settings. If you take all outdoor shots, this is just about the greatest point and shoot camera in the world. Video also looks pretty dang good, and while not a feature I considered when buying the camera, it was something I used quite often. The controls were all easy enough to use, and while the buttons and settings aren't the best designed things in the world, after playing around with the camera for an hour or so it's not too hard to figure out the main features and how to use them (although some features remain a mystery that even the manual couldn't solve).And on to the bad. While all my outdoor shots were excellent looking, especially for a lower priced digital camera, the camera was really not up to par on indoor shots. On its automatic settings, I found the camera to be rather 'stupid' in determining how to process the shot. Even in moderately bright rooms with plenty of indirect sunlight in the middle of the day, the camera loves to flash the immediate subject and darken the background. Photos in a well lit restaurant would come out with the subject looking pretty good and the background looking like we were in a medieval dungeon. And we were in Florida, so when I say a well lit restaurant, I mean pretty dang sunny.The manual settings performed much better indoors - many of the shots taken at 400 and 800 ISO on the manual setting turned out great. The only problem with these is that you experience quite a bit of blurring when there's not 100% sunlight outside, so for every good indoor photo there were 2 or 3 bad. And of course, if it happens to be dark outside, you get a huge amount of blurring. If one were to look at my photo of the Disney World castle at 7 pm, the automatic setting photo came out as a almost completely black photo with just the windows in the castle barely visible (and that thing is pretty bright). On manual, I had the choice of a blurry mess at 800ISO, or a moderately less blurry mess at 1600 ISO that was so grainy it looked rather like an old newspaper photo. The other digital cameras in the group were quite capable of taking a photo of people with the castle in the background and exposing them correctly while capturing the glowing castle, but the 870 was not.Of course, no inexpensive camera is going to function all that well in darkness, and I wouldn't expect it to. What I do expect from a camera this price is to be able to point and shoot a photo of friends in a well lit hotel lobby without blurring everything or coming out with completely darkened backgrounds. The 870 did not seem to be able to handle this at all, and photos in any lobby or lounge came out like we spent our vacation in the most dimly lit place on earth.As a side note, someone in our party brought their Fuji s700 digital camera, and in my opinion it outperformed the 870 in almost every aspect. The best 20% of the 870's photos looked a bit better than the Fuji's, but the other 80% didn't look anywhere as good. So, despite loving the size and features and most things about this camera, upon arriving home it was packed up and returned. I wouldn't pay more than $150 for something that performs the way the 870 did.

To help narrow the choices, I had a few guidelines in mind:1. Cost no more than $3002. Must have excellent image quality.3. Must have optical image stabilization.There are many cameras available for that price point, so I checked the reviews of all the latest models. Any camera that had image problems mentioned in a review was removed from my list. I also wanted image stabilization to improve our chances of getting clear sharp pictures. You may have only one opportunity to take that shot, so IS is a must have in my opinion.This search led me to the Canon SD800 camera series. I ended up choosing the SD870 because of the larger 3\" LCD. I have little kids that love to see the pictures you just took, so I thought a bigger LCD would make viewing with 3 kids huddled around the camera easier.After playing around with the SD870 for a while, I'm very impressed with it. The larger LCD was a big hit. Who needs a viewfinder when you have this nice LCD to look at? I had no problem using the LCD outside with the sun directly behind me. If you are worried about saving battery power, bring an extra battery.The image quality is fantastic. Be sure to set the camera at ISO 80 and enable auto ISO shift. This will force the camera to use ISO 80 whenever it can and only increase the ISO only when necessary. At ISO 200 and above, noise in the image becomes more apparent.Taking video with the image stabilization is a treat. The video is so smooth that is looks like you are using a camera boom. I only wish the camera allowed the lens to zoom in and out while recording video. You can zoom prior to starting your video, but I don't understand why you can't zoom while recording.What really impressed me is this is the first camera that I owned that could take pictures in our kitchen without having the colors come out reddish. Even with a Canon XTi DSLR, I had to set a custom white balance to get the colors to come out right. The SD870 got it right automatically.Overall, I am very happy with the camera. I think it is worth the extra money to get the larger LCD. Having the wide angle lens and a bunch of shooting modes is just icing on the cake.", "Date": "December 20, 2007"}, {"Title": "A great camera with some annoyances", "Author": "Bertilak", "ReviewID": "R6I8SH5J8I4LB", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Although this is a great camera there are two minor annoyances I would like to highlight.ANNOYANCE 1: It has a USB connection but it works in a non-standard way. It *only* works on Windows or Mac with the supplied software (and there is at least one Linux solution available -- gphoto2). This poses a problem when plugging it into the USB port on a TV that can read and display images and sound from a USB device -- they know nothing about the proprietary interface presented by the camera and therefore cannot display the contents. It is an example of the trouble that can be caused by not abiding by formally recognized standards. (I would expect this from Sony, but not Canon!) But the simple work-around is to remove the card from the camera and, using a USB SD-reader, plug it directly into the TV. See RECOMMENDATION 1, below.My previous camera had a setting that allowed it to work in \"mass storage\" mode (I think that's what it was called). This allowed me to plug it into any USB port and read the card as if the cameras wasn't even involved. I couldn't find such a setting on this camera. Maybe I just haven't figured that out yet. I hope someone can correct me. If so I'll edit this review.ANNOYANCE 2: You can only date/timestamp your photos in one of the shooting modes (postcard). Why Canon would impose this limitation is mystifying.I also have a few recommendations:RECOMMENDATION 1: You will need to get an SD (or SDHC) card for your camera as the one supplied with the camera has much too low a capacity to be of practical use. The manual even states that not all camera features will work with the supplied card.I found the following and just received it from Amazon:SanDisk 4 GB Extreme III SDHC Card with MicroMate USB 2.0 Reader (SDSDRX3-4096-A21, Retail Package)BUT: see my review athttp://www.amazon.com/review/R9SW94C4AKBI1/ref=cm_cr_rdp_permas this SDHC card may or may not come with the reader discussed here!It is quite nice and includes a small USB device that works perfectly as I described in the paragraph above. In the picture at the link, notice that the USB device is not much larger than the SDHC card itself, making it easy to toss into any camera bag that has room for a spare SD card.RECOMMENDATION 2: I wanted something to protect the camera as I carry it around, but I didn't want to negate the \"ultra-compact\" advantage of true portability. I found the following which is just the right size and the camera still fits in a shirt pocket when in the case.Case Logic UNZ-2 Small Black Case.Be sure to get a UNZ-2. Amazon has mostly UNZ-3, which is too big. The link's product dimensions make no sense, but I have a UNZ-2 and it is the right size. There are other colors available.RECOMMENDATION 3: I also wanted a case that could be used for travel -- something that could carry the camera, its charger, spare battery, spare SD card, etc. I found the following which is large enough for all that. It can hold the camera even when it is in the case above. And it is still small enough to throw in a glove compartment. It wouldn't take up much room in carry-on luggage either.Case Logic TBC-3 Camera Bagrcp", "Date": "January 25, 2008"}, {"Title": "Totally happy I bought this camera", "Author": "Y. Deshmukh \"Yogibear\"", "ReviewID": "RTWY4GX60F61O", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I wanted to replace an aging digital Canon Powershot camera earlier this month, and started my research at cnet.com and amazon.com. I thought it would be a question of reading a few articles, narrowing the list down to a few cameras, and then reading reviews about it on those two websites and bingo, I would end up with the perfect camera for my situation and needs. Boy, was I wrong!First off, there are probably about a thousand decent camera models out there that would satisfy anyone but the most diehard camera professional. I am an average, non-expert user who craves convenience, ease of use, low shutter lag, ease of carrying around, and reasonably good quality pics in most lighting and situations. Nothing fancy.After reading amazon users' comments about the models that cnet's editors recommended, I realized there were a LOT of models out there that I could buy that would satisfy my criteria listed above. I ended up researching this for over 15 days, for hours at a time after work and on weekends.Here is a summary (in no particular order) of why I chose this camera and why I like it, after two weeks of intensive use on vacation in Russia:1) Ease of use - I had to refer to the manual only once or twice as I took hundreds of pics and many video clips in different situations and lighting.2) Relatively slim and light to carry around in my shirt or pant pocket.3) Wide-angle lens - most of my pics tend to be of people, whether in posed photos or candid shots. This model has a roughly 28-105mm equivalent optical zoom (hence the 3.8x designation, i.e. 105 divided by 28). Unless you regularly take pics of distant objects or wild animals, you don't need 12x or 18x optical zoom. Sure, more zoom is better, but it comes at the cost of increased bulk. And increased bulk means you are less likely to take your camera with you and take pics.The wide angle means better group shots. That's why I did not buy any other model that had 5x zoom in a slim body, for example - because almost all of them had lenses that started from 35 or 38mm, and those don't fit people into the shots as well as a wide angle lens does.4) Reasonably high mega pixel count. 8MP is good enough, unless you regularly take pics that you want to blow up into large sizes for printing.5) Optical image stabilization - very good feature, because it cancels out camera shake and results in better pictures.6) Good-quality video clips that are very easy to shoot. Plus, the built-in microphone on this model is powerful and picks up conversations from across a room in video mode. Or, you can record your own commentary on top of a video clip afterwards.7) Reasonably low shutter lag - unless you buy an expensive (and necessarily bulkier) digital SLR or megazoom camera, you are going to get some shutter lag on any digital camera. The question is, can you live with it if it is low enough? This model's shutter lag is not bad at all.8)Canon quality. There is a reason that Canon's at the top of the heap in digital cameras, and this model's further proof of it.9) Rechargeable battery that comes with its own (relatively slim) charger. I had carried along a voltage converter and different plugs for use with my other devices in Russia anyway, so this was a big plus for me. Using disposable batteries usually increases the camera's weight.10) Beautifully crisp, large (3\") LCD screen. I did not feel the absence of an optical viewfinder at all, since using the screen even in broad daylight was so good and so convenient.11) Good-quality pics.Websites used in my research - cnet, amazon, pcmag.com, among many.Other models considered - Canon's SD970is, 850is, 890is, 950is, 1100is; Nikon Coolpix S600 and S550; Panasonic Lumix DMC-LZ8S; Olympus FE-350. I read about some of Sony's point and shoot cameras, but did not want to buy them because everything about Sony is proprietary, which means every single item related to their products needs to be only Sony's and, naturally, costs more.Finally, a note on the fact that this model is almost 10 months old now. Initially, this was a downer for me, despite the numerous awards and favorable user reviews it has garnered. There was one expert review on a British website that finally put it in perspective for me - to wit, that newer models from a particular brand aren't necessarily improvements over the older ones and that if you like the features of an older model, to go ahead and buy it.I would highly recommend this particular model from Canon.

If you can live without an optical viewfinder and are careful around the battery doors, I'd tell anyone looking for a digital camera to look no further than this model.Canon's, as a general rule, are great performers and this camera goes above and beyond expectation.  Image quality is spot on!  The image stabilizer does help (just don't expect miracles).  The slightly longer (and wider) than average zoom lens is just a treat.  It's pretty speedy (won't set any records, but it won't hold you up either).  One thing I thoroughly enjoy about this camera (especially over the Canon sd900 I'm upgrading from) is that it shows you the battery level on the LCD screen (whereas the sd900 would only alert you when the battery is dead or dying).I'll also say that the back of the camera is a little full, so you might just want to check one out in person to make sure the design suits you well.

While the Sony T200/70s are sleeker, more stylish, and have touchscreen displays, they suffer from poor picture quality and LCD screens - grainy/noisy pics, and slightly pixelated LCD, especially the T200.The SD800/870s take much superior pics with a high-quality LCD display. The wide-angle lens rocks big-time - almost 33% more detail in shots. The main difference between the SD800 and 870 is that the 870 has a 3 inch LCD (800 has a 2.5 inch LCD, with the optical viewfinder) and no optical viewfinder. The bigger screen is worth the extra bucks, in my opinion - but if you wanna save some $, then the 800 does everything else the 870 can.The SD870 almost delivers on everything - great wide angle lens, great quality pics, LCD screen visible even in bright sunlight, easy to use and pocket.On the downside, the body build is not very solid, due to use of plastic parts, it has no HD video mode (only VGA), and there is no zoom in video mode.It still gets 5 stars, because it comes way ahead of its competition. Easily the best in its category.", "Date": "December 4, 2007"}, {"Title": "What could be better?", "Author": "Sonsinger \"Sonsinger\"", "ReviewID": "R1UK1PBJE3PNEI", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "First, my apologies to the extreme photo enthusiasts out there who typically write these reviews.  They speak of chromatic aberration, barrel distortion, noise at high ISO settings, the need for a view finder, and the like.  I am not one of you.  You are great and I love to read that stuff, but I needed a camera that had a big, clear display, was simple to operate, and takes great snapshots at family gatherings and on vacations.If you are like me, then get this camera.  It has a big, clear display, it is simple to operate, and it takes great snapshots at family gatherings and on vacations.My wife and I were dazzled by the display.  It is beautiful, even in bright sunshine.  That is probably my biggest complaint with the reviews I read on this camera, that the LCD is not good in bright sunshine.  Those reviewers are wrong.  Even with my poor eyesight I have no trouble framing my shot and then viewing the resulting photo in any lighting conditions except the darkest of rooms, where even a view finder would have problems.This camera has a LOT of options, but the options that I use the most are right there and as simple to find as any digital camera I looked at, and I looked at a lot of cameras.  The options I need the most are:1.  On-Off.  Sounds stupid, but on some cameras, this is not that easy.2.  Shutter button.  Big and easy to find by touch.3.  Zoom.  The toggle for this is small, but it is a small camera.  On all small cameras the zoom buttons are small.  I like the toggle right up there by the shutter button.  You can easily move your finger from the shutter button to the zoom and back without looking.4.  Flash on-off.  Done with the little round rocker on the back.  The little round rocker on the back is small and the icons on it are hard to see for older people, like myself.  However, this is a problem for all small cameras.  It's just a tradeoff you make when you get a small camera.  It has to be small to fit on the small camera.  Once you find it though, it is easy to remember, plus when you touch this rocker, a larger representation of it appears on the screen.  This will help you find the flash on-off function.5.  Timer.  It is on the little round rocker also.6.  Reviewing the photos that you already took.  This function is a little bit complicated on every digital camera I have ever seen.  On the SD870IS, it is about as simple as any I have seen.  It is something you have to practice if you want to be able to do it quickly and seamlessly.7.  Getting the photos off the camera.  I have played with the software that comes with the camera and it is OK.  No better and no worse than other software I have seen and tried to use.  Rather than mess with it and also train my wife on how to use it, we just prefer to do it the way we did it with our old camera.  Not real simple (certainly no more difficult than the Canon software), but we have a routine that works for us.The picture quality is great.  Some flash shots are a little over-exposed, but we adjust that with Picasa.  Easy to do.  Over all, the quality of pictures we get is better than we got with our old digital camera, a Panasonic.  It would take some great pictures but it was inexplicably inconsistent.  Still, it was a fine camera that took a lot of abuse.  Still works but it has a too-small display and we were ready to change after 5 years with it.One other little bonus...the camera is ready to go within a second or two of turning it on.  That is a very nice feature.  Some cameras take quite a bit longer.  This is not a big deal for patient people, but it is nice.Are there negatives?  So far I have found one little quibble.  I agree with other reviews that finding a way to hold this camera is not intuitively obvious.  You have to work with it to find a way to hold it without getting a finger in front of the flash, or to hold it with one hand.  I think that is the price you pay when you buy a small camera that has almost the whole back taken up by an LCD display.  But for me, the huge LCD display was one of the big selling points.  And I must say that I was not ready for how beautifully this display works.I did not review the hundreds of other options with this camera because I probably won't use them much.  But the Canon SD870IS fits my requirements very well.  If your requirements are like mine, I encourage you to take a good look at it.", "Date": "December 27, 2007"}, {"Title": "Comparing Canon PowerShot Digital ELPH cameras", "Author": "Julie Neal", "ReviewID": "R33ONIFVK5SH98", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "As a travel writer I spend a lot of time at Walt Disney World, and Canon PowerShot Digital Elphs are the most common cameras I see. Families seem to love them, because they're so easy to carry and operate. About the size of a deck of playing cards, each of these \"pocket cameras\" really do slip right into a pants pocket, and their rectangular designs make them easy to grip. Best of all, they all take good photos. (How do I know? Because I've actually gotten to use every one of these models. Nearly every day guests ask me to take photos of them with their own cameras, which most often are Canon PowerShot Digital Elphs.)Here's my breakdown of the ten bestselling Digital Elph models. Any of the first six are superb choices:1ST PLACE: SD1100 ISAn update to the SD1000 (see below), this 2008 8MP beauty adds image stabilization, a slightly longer zoom (38-114 mm), another MP of photo size and a small indent on the right side for a better grip. Plus it comes in colors! My daughter has a blue one and uses it every single day. During school days the image stabilization made a real difference in her on-the-bus shots. With that heavy of use hers has gotten scratched up a bit, but the marks are small and hardly noticeable.2ND PLACE: SD870 IS (The camera on this page)The ELPH to buy if you want a wide-angle lens. Slightly thicker than the SD1100 IS, this 8MP model doesn't have an optical viewfinder which makes it tough to use in bright sunlight, otherwise there's little not to love. My husband uses one as a comp camera, to compose shots for the travel guide \"The Complete Guide to Walt Disney World.\"3RD PLACE: SD770 ISJust released in May, this 10 MP model is, in a way, an update of the SD1100 IS (see above). I rate it lower because it costs about $50 more and doesn't come in colors. On the other hand, it has a longer battery life than the 1100 and features an improved LCD screen that is very easy to view. As for photo quality, I can't tell the difference.4TH PLACE: SD950 ISThere's a lot to like in this 12.1 MP camera. First off, it's gorgeous. The body, though a little thick, is titanium. An upgrade to the SD850 IS (see below), it has a 3.7x zoom lens and adds manual controls as well as the ability to stitch together panoramic images. The only reason I don't rate it higher is the price.5TH PLACE: SD890 ISWant a long zoom lens? Here's your baby, a 2008 10 MP model with a 5x zoom. Also has the new bright LCD screen and all the other 2008 Canon goodies. The most expensive Canon PowerShot ELPH.6TH PLACE: SD790 ISWith the same 10 MP image sensor and 3x zoom lens as the SD770 IS, this 2008 model stands out only for its larger 3-inch LCD display and, as a result, lack of optical viewfinder. The rear controls are different, too, with a flatter design that uses fewer buttons.7TH PLACE: SD1000In my opinion there's no reason to buy this 7.1 MP model. Released in 2007, it's been replaced by the SD1100 IS (see above). The SD1000 is a fine camera but it doesn't have image stabilization, a key feature of the 2008 lineup.8TH PLACE: SD850 ISThe ancestor to the SD890 IS, this 8 MP Elph combines a 4x zoom and 8 MP photo size with an image stabilizer. Every button, dial and switch has a quality feel. Slighter larger than the other models here, it is a little tougher to pop in and out of your pocket, but if you have larger hands it may be just what you are looking for.9TH PLACE: SD800 ISThis 7.1 MP predecessor to the 870 doesn't focus well at its edges when set at its widest angle. Unless it's priced really cheap, get the 870 instead.10TH PLACE: SD750The 2007 PowerShot flagship offers a light meter that adjusts for facial brightness, 17 shooting modes, some first-rate movie features and red-eye correction -- features that were innovative a year ago but are common in Canon's latest models. No image stabilization; no optical viewfinder. Choose a 2008 model instead.", "Date": "June 8, 2008"}, {"Title": "Canon on the right track", "Author": "A. Yen", "ReviewID": "RMHIAUO3XUFD1", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I purchased the Canon SD800IS last year and was ready to pickup the matching waterproof housing for my vacation to Maui. But after being questioned by friends on whether to upgrade from their SD750 to the SD870IS, I did some deeper research on the SD870IS, both online and at a local store for the hands-on experience. To my pleasant surprise, I found that the SD870IS more matched my shooting style and preference than the SD800IS even though the upgrade between models in minor. Thus, I bought the SD870IS along with the matching WP_SC17 underwater housing.What I liked:1) The \"play\" as a button keeping the camera in an always-ready-to-shoot mode instead of missing the shot because I didn't turn the mode dial.2) I could assign the \"print/share\" button to something else more useful; for me, it's instant movie mode.3) The time-lapse movie mode which takes a picture every 1 or 2 seconds up to 2 hours and creates a VGA 15 fps movie.4) The auto ISO boost which will bump the ISO up till the shaky hand icon disappears; this can be set to be done automatically or with the print/share button.5) The 3\" LCD screen - big and beautiful.6) The now included battery-life indicator which has been missing from the ELF cameras since my original S400. It's not accurate, but does provide for some advance warning other than \"your camera is about to shut off after the next shot.\"What I didn't like:1) The flash, while powerful for the size of the camera, is too close to the lens and will produce white flash orbs if there's any dust in the air. I have the same issue with the SD800IS. This is not a biggie as I prefer to take natural light photos anyways.2) The time-lapse movie mode is limited to 2 hours. 4 hours would be perfect to capture the sunrise on top of Haleakala in Maui.", "Date": "March 4, 2008"}, {"Title": "Nimble, tiny, capable point-and-shoot", "Author": "Eric C. Williams", "ReviewID": "R217J5Y3DI0Y1P", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I'm a DSLR user (the Pentax K100D is my main camera) who wanted a tiny camera I could always carry around with me, no matter where I go. But, being a DSLR user, I'm used to having complete manual control over my camera's operation. So when I went looking for a point-and-shoot I had these requirements:1. Tiny size - I wanted it to fit in a pocket, or in a cell-phone holster on my hip. Without this, I'm a lot less likely to have it with me all the time. The Canon certainly fits the bill here. I carry it in an iPhone holster.2. Wide angle - If you have a camera with a fixed lens, I think it's better to err on the side of wide. It makes it easy to get everything into the picture, particularly when photographing people. And now that I'm used to the Canon's lovely 28mm (35mm equiv) wide angle lens, I don't think I could go back.3. Good image quality - The camera should shine in ideal conditions, and allow you enough control to get a good image when conditions are not ideal. The perfect camera would have good low-light (high ISO) performance, but it seems that's nearly impossible to find in a point-and-shoot these days. At the very least, ISO 400 should not look like a poorly-tuned TV. Again, the Canon fits the bill. Image quality is generally very good, and ISO 400 is usable in a pinch. I would not take it above that, but I think you could say that of any point-and-shoot. Additionally, the Canon has a nice \"Auto ISO Shift\" feature. When using this you set the ISO where you'd like it and the camera warns you if it thinks the ISO should be higher. A press of a button will allow the camera to use the ISO it thinks is best, or you can leave the ISO at your own setting. It's a nice balance between manual and auto ISO control.4. Manual control - I wanted a camera that would allow me to set the aperture and shutter speed, or at the very least provide aperture-priority and shutter-priority modes. The Canon doesn't provide any manual features like this, unfortunately. The best it provides is \"long exposure\" mode, where you can set the shutter speed between 1\" and 15\".It seems there is no single point-and-shoot camera on the market today that fills all four of my requirements. But the Canon fills the first three, and it does a fantastic job of it. So much so, in fact, that I'm no longer concerned about having forgone total manual control. This camera provides enough control over the image that I don't think I will ever encounter a situation where I'll say \"I can't get that shot\".I compared this camera to three others: the Panasonic Lumix DMC-TZ3, the Panasonic Lumix DMC-FX33, and the Fujifilm Finepix F50FD.Both the Panasonics have a nice 28mm lens, and the TZ3 has an astounding 28-280mm zoom, but they don't seem to have the image quality of the Canon. In particular, their high-ISO performance is not as good.I almost bought the Fujifilm Finepix F50FD, because it's one of the few cameras with manual control. It's image quality and high-ISO performance are also on par with the Canon. Unfortunately, the Fujifilm has a very boring 35-105mm zoom.The Canon Powershot SD870IS is a very nimble photographic tool that's ready to respond to creative opportunity very quickly. It's the perfect camera for carrying around and grabbing snapshots of the kids, or for keeping with you when a larger camera setup would be too heavy or bulky.

However, it is large and heavy, so I bought this camera for those situations when lugging around a DSLR is not the most convenient solution.  My wife carries the SD870IS in her purse all the time, and we often take pictures instead of jotting down notes.  The camera is beautiful, and the gigantic screen looks very good, even in daylight (some people have complained about it being prone to fingerprints, which is true to a degree -- nothing like an iPod, though -- but it is also true that it wipes clean very easily on a shirt sleeve; it doesn't seem to scratch easily, either -- also unlike the iPod).  The camera is a little heavy for its size, which gives it a good solid feeling.  Despite its diminutive size, it takes very good pictures -- not as good as what I get with my DSLR, but clearly superior to compact cameras of two years ago.  The colors are beautiful, thanks to the modern image sensor and the latest Digic III image processor.  There is no detectable noise up to ISO 400.  Images are grainy but largely usable at ISO 1600.  It starts up very quickly.  The flash recycle time is not that great, but not bad at all for a compact camera.  The image stabilization works very effectively, and I am often able to take sharp pictures without a tripod even when the camera displays the \"camera shake\" warning.  The autofocus system is one of the best points of this camera.  It works reasonably well in low light, too.  Face detection works most of the time and comes in very handy.  The battery lasts a long time; I don't know how long, because I haven't ran it down yet -- definitely more than 400 images.  I don't like the fact that I have to take the battery out to charge it, but I don't have to do that all that often anyway.  Unused, the battery seems to keep its charge for more than a month.  I like the controls, and I got used to them very quickly.  While not as easy to tweak the manual settings as on a DSLR, the ergonomics of the controls and menus are very good; they are very similar to the older Canon models.  I can't comment about Canon's bundled software, because I use it only to download the images off the camera -- and I have no complaints about that.

It's perfect for taking group photos and people. I wont bore you with the other details because I am sure you've already read about them.So here are the cons of this camera.1. I previously had a SD450 in my pocket all the time. This is its replacement. I never had issues with the camera accidentally turning itself on with the SD450. The power button on the SD870 is too sensitive or poorly placed because it has accidentally turned on a few times.2. The build quality is very questionable. The first one Amazon sent had a cluster of dead pixels on the camera's sensor end. (The red dots showed up on the view finder and on the computer screen). Without hassle, Amazon sent me another one.The other one worked fine until it developed an artifact. I keep the camera inside an Oakley sunglass bag in my pocket so it's well protected. So, I tried cleaning the lens and the artifact remained. The artifact I speak of is a consistent patch of darker color on the picture.

They may not have as many \"trick\" features as other cameras, but after all of the digital's that we have gone through I would say that they are the best bet for point and shoot simplicity and quality. It is really hard to take a bad picture with this thing. And the new scratch and fingerprint proof screen is really a great feature too. Its a small thing, but I used to spend $10-15 on a screen protector everytime I purchased a camera. It's not necessary with this camera. And I always buy extra batteries for my digital's too.

It cannot replace a good DSLR nor is it good as my older G5. But that said, I cannot fault the portability of this camera. It is very useful to have a quality camera that you can just put into your pocket and take out as needed. This,however,highlights a serious design flaw - the on/off switch is too easy to engage (a slider would have made more sense). This means that the camera can (and does) come on in error. If this occurs while in a pocket it is easy for the camera lens to malfunction. This happened to me and many others on this and various other forums.

The wide angle lens is very nice and one of the main reason I bought the camera.The photos tend to be good with some mixed results that I'll comment on.The more notable problems with the camera that bothered me are:1.In sunny outdoor shots with shadows the shadows are very dark in the photos compared to the sunny areas. This is a very noticeable effect and not very desirable! If I'm standing in the shadows you almost can't make me out. If I move out of the shadow the other areas of the scene that we are interested in are way to dark.  My wife also commented on this for many shots on our trip.2.Photos indoors with good light using auto  flash often come out very dark and unusable. Taking the same photo without the flash results in a much better photo in many cases.  I think the image stabilization helped a lot on these shots. Not always perfect but I was pleased with the stabilization.Video is good/ok. I used it a fair amount and it's real handy to be able to take photos or video with the same camera and a real benefit to not have to carry both. There are 2 quality versions of VGA video. The lower quality VGA movies (640x480) aren't bad and I used this most of the time to save space on my 16GB SD card. Indoor videos do  have some noise associated with them but aren't too bad. HD video would be nice I think but the SD memory space for them might make that feature questionable. Some commented that the optical zoom didn't work with video?? I think optical zoom does work on video on  mine?The use of SDHC cards is nice.I use a very cheap 16GB SDHC  4X card I bought ($29) that holds a ton a photos and compared it against a 2GB 150X cards in terms of speed (how fast I could take photos and how fast I could transfer video to my computer) I couldn't tell any real difference between the two. However note that you do need a SDHC reader to transfer from your SDHC card to computer or used the port on the side of the camera to transfer to your computer.The 3\" LCD screen is nice but it does get a bit washed out in bright outdoor light (Still usable) and it gets smeared easily. The screen did develop a defect of about 3/4\" after a few days but seemed to go away for the most part. That area of the screen is now slightly different in shading then the rest of the screen. I think I will return it while its under warrante for this problem.Size of the camera is nice and not too bulky. It easily fits in my pocket  without a case.  Battery life is good/ok and I could use 1 battery for a full day of touring in Russia with lots of video and reviewing the shots I took. toward the end of the day (7 hrs) I would run out of battery so a second battery would have worked out nice but it wasn't really necessary since we had more then enough photos and I could recharge the battery back on the cruise ship. Charge time for the battery is 2 hrs.I liked using the extra button on the camera as a user defined button. I set mine up to go into Hi ISO mode. On  a low light shot I could put the camera into Hi ISO mode and see the difference between shutter speed and  iso. You can set it to other functions also. It takes 2 fingers to use that button so its a bit clumsy to use. Using Hi ISO all the time seemed to be questionable vs just putting the camera into Hi ISO when I needed it.

But knowing Canon, I would say this is equally as sturdy.Peeve: In a time when amateurs are playing around with things like HDR, exposure bracketing and other such useful features seems to be absent / hard to find.Summary:Incredible camera, makes taking great pictures amazingly easy. Much better and better value for money compared to other brands' similar offerings. Very good user interface and ergonomics, novice users will immediately be able to use it (including the older generation). This is a better value for money than the 9xx series, which is charging more for a higher megapixel count (WHICH IS NOT WORTH IT).

Optics are not so good though.Pros:- Responsive user interface with excellent adjustments in manual mode which offers a custom setting with sharpness, contrast, saturation, and separate R/G/B levels!- In-camera editing with very effective red-eye removal; it amazingly detects where (even multiple) pairs of eyes are, and you can also manually point to any area you want to apply the reduction.- Good image quality even at lower light levers.- High-speed USB2 interface.- Good quality movie mode (and cool time-lapse movie mode)  although optical zoom/autofocus don't work during captureCons:- Red eye appears in every single picture I take with flash. The Panasonic DMC-TZ3 which I tried did not have this problem. I think the Canon's flash is too close to the lens. If Canon moved the flash to the corner of the camera furthest from the lens it would reduce the problem. Thankfully in-camera editing has good red-eye removal capability.- No USB mass device support, so I can't mount the camera; however \"gphoto2 -P\" downloads all files just fine on myubuntu linux box.- Optics not good. I see glare in a several of my pictures (big, bright, circular spots if a light source shines direct on the camera at a specific angle). My old S40 did not have this problem. Also the lens has strong barrel distortion especially at wideangle, causing fish-eye images. If you take a picture of a building or picture frame so it almost fills the photo, you'll see lines severely bent at all 4 edges of the screen.Thankfully there is free software that corrects lens distortion, like fulla (part of hugin-tools) and clens,which use a free version of the commercial PTLens software camera/lens database.

I want to report on the use of this camera which does not have a viewfinder in bright light. I had been using a 4 year old weatherproof camera with viewfinder and about a 1.5 inch screen. (Olympus Stylus 400) It' screen is not visible at all in bright light. I used it mostly while hiking and backpacking, so there is often bright sun and the viewfinder is essential. I was determined to find a camera with a viewfinder and large display and a wider angle lens. The weather proof aspect was not as important as I have always managed to keep the camera dry stored in double zip lock bags, in the worst conditions. After weeks of research, I became discouraged and started thinking about settling for a model without a viewfinder. I read a review of this camera by a snowboarder who did not mention screen visibility in the sun, which I took as a good sign. Other research had indicated that the newer models had much improved screens for bright light use. I have had the camera for about a month and used it for about a week around Lake Tahoe and Squaw Valley in bright sun/snowy conditions. The SD870IS display is bright enough that you can easily frame a picture under any lighting conditions. Holding the Disp button down for a few seconds temporarily kicks the brightness up to full, but I have not found the need to use it. The large screen also makes menus easy to use as well. Another important feature of this camera for outdoor scenery is it's wide angle lens (28 mm equivalent as compared to 35 mm for many cameras). The size and weight are also important features for backpacking.

We were not dissapointed. The camera was extremely easy to use and taking pictures was very quick. One thing that I think would be nice is to be able to force the flash to be on in auto mode, but it's not a big deal since it's very easy to switch to manual mode and do that. Most of the camera features practically pop out at you as you scroll through them, which makes it very easy to actually use them: like switching between ISO levels, between regular size shot and wide angle shots, between flash modes, and between regualr mode and timer modes (and easy to set up custom timer modes). You can also easily line pictures up for stitching them together later. The optical zoom was more than adequate, and using even more digital zoom is very seemless if desired.I already had most of the pictures we took developed and they turned out great. Even my pictures I took at night with ISO 1600 turned out great. And they look great on the computer too, as you'd expect. The only thing is that you need to be careful developing your wide angle shots with some of these places because of cropping. The default 4x6 will definitly crop your wide angle shots.Perhaps the only other thing this camera is missing is another tri-pod screw-in spot for vertical shots (already has one for horizontal shots). As for not having a view finder, I never missed it. I can't really think of any instances when you'd need to use it. The LCD screen is huge, which is great!

The SD870 is definitely the focus group evolution of the SD850 (Canon listened to its customers' complaints).  The SD870 on/off button is on top and much easier to access.  There is now a dedicated \"review button\" (no longer do you need to click the wheel back and forth to proof your shot).  The size and thickness of the cameras are essentially the same, but the SD870 is considerably lighter.  The 28mm lens gives the SD870 a wider shot, but it does have more of the \"barrelling effect,\" but still ever so slight.  The viewscreen is much larger than the SD850 and does very well in direct sunlight.  I am not too particularly concerned with not having a viewfinder in that the SD850 viewfinder is almost cosmetic in nature (no crosshairs, no borders, not accurate).  I prefer using a viewfinder on SLRs, but on compacts I question the usefulness of them.  The start time for the SD870 is a split second faster than the SD850.  All the camera effects that the SD850 has, including facial recognition and color accent are all available in the SD870.  These subtle improvements may not be enough to convince you to dish out a little extra for the SD870, but the bigger screen size, wider lens, and lighter weight were the reasons why I made the switch.

All of my past point-and-shoot cameras have been Sony Cyber-Shots. That said, I didn't know exactly what to expect from Canon, though I knew they had a certain standard of quality.I'm extremely pleased with this camera so far. Not only is it comfortable to use, but the image quality is superb. I previously owned a DSC-W80, and I was so disappointed by how muddy the picture quality was. In this age where cramming more megapixels onto small sensors is the norm, I was afraid that this 8.0mp camera would be more of the same. I was very pleasantly surprised! Canon's noise reduction is mild, and doesn't destroy the image. The images are a little soft/unsharp, but that is to be expected from ANY digital compact, so that's not a knock at the product.The camera comes with a 241 page manual. There's a lot to do with this camera, and I recommend thumbing through the manual to get an understanding of it all. In the most basic automatic mode, it takes excellent photos, but the real fun is in the other modes.My favorite modes in particular are the color accent and color swap. Color accent allows you to select a specific color in the frame, and isolate it in the picture. So, let's say you take a picture of your friend who is wearing a red shirt. You tell the camera to isolate the red, and that will be the ONLY color visible in the photo; the rest is black & white. Very fun mode, and very simple to use. It works much better with bold and bright colors, so soft neutrals and pastels won't work as well. Color swap is similar to the accent mode, but you get to select a color to isolate, then a second color to switch it with. So if you take that picture again of the person in red, but then select a green color to swap it with, voila! The red shirt is now green.Image stabilization is great, but please be sensible; it's not a miracle worker. If you're taking a quick indoor shot and want more natural lighting, it's great. Don't expect to take low ISO night shots without a flat surface.The fact that the lens is wide-angle, too. This has a nice zoom range.The manual mode is great. Up to 15 seconds of exposure! That's really amazing for a compact, in my opinion. I took a picture of my window at night, and got a nicely exposed shot of the light coming in.Movie mode is nice, and allows digital zooming while recording, but no optical zoom.The startup is really quick, picture reviewing is just as fast and easy, and the touch sensitive control on the back even has a scroll wheel effect if you move your thumb around the ring.I've honestly never been so impressed by a compact camera before. I don't even mind that there's no optical viewfinder, because the 3 inch screen is so crisp and clear that you don't mind.It also has one flat side so you can rest it in portrait orientation and take a timed shot without a tripod.I can't say enough good things about it.

This is HUGE for getting great group shots in small spaces, or even taking a picture of you and your wife with your own hand! It's not quite as good for taking pictures of a Packer game from the stands, though the 3.8x zoom is the best I've had so far, you just don't get in as close.

I just carry my little Canon EVERYWHERE, so I get a lot of great shots. This leads me to the second outstanding feature, and actually the reason I upgraded from my trusty SD200: AMAZING VIDEO! I liked the video from my SD200. It made for great home movies because I had the camera with me all the time so the content was interesting. I tolerated the sub-DV quality because I'd rather carry a smaller camera. My main complaint was a shaky image, and Canon addressed that with their new IS series. (Image Stabilization) I'm sure they designed it for clearer zoomed in pictures, but it does WONDERS for the video! No more nausea when panning across a landscape! It's also MUCH brighter and clearer. I won't say it's as good as a DV video camera, but I will say that I wouldn't trade the every-day video I get of my son with my PowerShot for any $2,000 state-of-the-art digital video camera that, because of its size, would only be around to capture birthdays and Christmas.

We have had it for just over a year and it has been in the shop for repair 3 times.When we were looking to buy a digital camera, we looked at many styles, and we liked this one the best.  It had a lot of nice features, and picture quality was very good.  The only downside was that there was no viewfinder, so on a bright sunny day it's kind of hard to see the LCD.We have taken very good care of this camera.  After about 10 months, the mechanism that extended and opened the lens broke.  We sent it back to Canon for repair and then supposedly fixed it and sent it back.  When we got it back, it had the same problem, only with a slight variation.  We could now hear gears spinning and griding inside when the lens tried to extend.We sent it back to Canon again.  The 2nd repair request date was 1 month and 6 days after the first.  They fixed it again and sent it back to us.This time, the lens would extend properly, but the door that opens up to uncover the lens wouldn't open.It's currently back at Canon again for the third time.  Given the average time of about 3 weeks for each repair, allowing shipping and repair time, this camera has been out of our possession for about 2 1/2 months.  We've only owned it for 14 months.It is a nice camera, but ours appears to be a piece of junk.

Although I could appreciate convenience of having a small camera, I felt their small lenses didn't let in enough light to capture the photo perfectly. I currently own a digital SLR Rebel for which I purchased an image stabilized lens as an upgrade. I was so impressed with the quality of my photos with the image stabilized lens, I figured if there is any possible way to get good photos from a small camera lens, an image stabilized lens would be key. This camera is great. The image stabilized lens allows for the lens to stay open for a longer period of time (while minimizing blur from shakiness), thus capturing color and light beautifully. The camera takes beautiful shots. It's weighted nicely and feels good in the hands. As with all Canon's, the buttons are laid out in a clear manner, making it easy to switch around settings.

The Canon was slightly smaller, able to fit in front jeans pocket, and the image quality from other reviews was supposed to be slightly better.  The TZ3 had the main benefit of 10X zoom, while Canon had 3.8x.  Both had wide-angle 28mm and image stabilization, which is great.  The Canon was more expensive, but the portability and potential image quality issue swayed me toward the Canon.  I took the camera on a trip to Italy and Germany and was very pleased with the results.  While not a full manual camera, there are a lot of adjustable controls such as ISO that can be set by the user.  I used it with a Gorillapod tripod and the self-timer to take some great low-light photos at ISO 80.  The 3\" screen is absolutely gorgeous.  This camera takes SDHC cards, and I was able to find an 8GB card for $30 at Frys, which is more than 2000 photos.  I did buy an extra battery because the battery doesn't last nearly as long as claimed.

Doesn't matter what settings you choose or anything, the pictures will be blurry unless you can get your subject to be very still (which kids, pets, and most adults don't do well).

The white balance color compared to real life is off when it comes to pictures indoors under incandescent/fluorescent lighting and selecting the different white balance settings doesn't help much. It does have good close-up/macro pictures with good detail. But if you are into that kind of picture-taking you should probably just go with a dSLR camera, not a point-and-shoot. Another neat thing is that it has a vertical/horizontal sensor for the display. If you tilt the camera vertically while viewing a picture, the picture will tilt the way you tilted the camera (except upside-down). There's no flash for shadows, only standard and no-flash.

I bought the 800 predecessor for my daughter last year and she is very happy with it. The most important issue perhaps is the wide angle. You can not back away far enough from many subjects indoors with a 35 mm equivalent lens. Yes, you sacrifice the long telephoto end (without digital zoom) but unless you are photographing your daughters competitive event, you can walk closer to most subjects.My serious camera is a professional 4 x 5 view camera, and my semi serious camera is a 5D with 3 lenses. However this is a great camera as a handy reach for on the spur of the moment.I shouldn't even comment on image quality, it is good for nearly anything the above average shooter needs (or wants?). I have even included some shots from this camera on a wedding set.The one complaint is that the on/off switch is too easily pressed accidentally, the predecessor 800's power button was flush with the body, this one protrudes and an accidental turn on when the lens isn't able to extend wouldn't be the best for it. I glued a small half inch foam rubber furniture protector around it after punching a small hole in the middle to solve the problem.A side note of advice for a camera case is that the Tamrac T4 is a perfect fit for this camera. (I must have looked at least 20 cases, that one is simple without an overload of extra compartments and the camera fits smoothly in and out without any excess slop.

I said that is ridiculous for a camera that only cost several hundred dollars.  The Casio is more megapixels (10 vs 8), but that was overkill.  Unless you want to crop a small area and blow it way up, you dont need that many megapixels.The only downsides to this camera that I have found so far are that there are less shooting modes than the Casio had (most of which were not necessary) and switching to sound recording requires several steps.

I will def add to this review as I own it for longer.... but here's my take on this camera as of day one:I researched the HECK out of this camera purchase. I was up in the air about this one and the 1100IS. I liked that this one had a bigger LCD screen over the 2.5\" screen the 1100IS has. The 1100IS has an optical viewfinder, but I didn't find that to be a necessity for me.One big selling point for the 870IS is the fact that it has a wide angle lens. (and of course the big LCD screen).The 1100IS is smaller and slimmer, but in all actuality I like my cell phone, camera and other small electronics to not be TOO small otherwise I feel like I'm going to break them, drop them or lose them.So on to the actual review. I got my 870is home last night and immediately popped the battery and extra SD card I'd bought into it and started snapping away. This camera boots up SUPER quick so if you see anj awesome photo op, you don't have to wait agonizing moments for your camera to boot up while the moment potentially passes. With the flash on I was AMAZED at how fast the refresh rate was in between pics. (Considering I use to have a Nikon Coolpix 5600 that would refresh in 6-12 seconds this was SOOOOOOOOO much better!)I snapped some ordinary quick pics of my family and kitchen which turned out great, full of color and clarity. Then I started to get into the effects menus and options.The Color Accent mode has to by far be my favorite mode to shoot certain scenes with. I took a whole bunch of pics of my moms flowers with this mode (it's really easy to pick up the color you want to accent once you read how to do it).... I even took a pic of my yellow lab who wears a red collar and ONLY accented the color red.... so everything (including him) was black and white except his collar was a bright, rich red.... AWESOME picture!I did get to use the macro mode a few times, I LOVE that mode too along with color accent. You can get SUPER close to your subject, and you don't lose clarity.I have yet to take any really good landscape pics or movement pics (this will come in a later update).I've only chipped at the tip of the iceberg of what this camera is capable of doing.... and I can't wait to figure out EVERY mode and setting on this (for the quick point and shoot person this camera also works because it is simple to point and shoot everyday photos).... I'm the type who like to play around with manual settings a bit... this isn't a full blown SLR by any means, but it does have some flexibility to it to play with the settings.... and so far I'm absolutely blown away by the richness, clarity and quickness of this camera.So far, after owning this camera for one day and getting to play with it for 2-3 hours (read the manual a bit also) I LOVEEEEE this camera! I paid almost $300 for mine at Best Buy, I wasn't going to take my chances with shipping it from some online store or trying to shop for it at the cheapest deal (cuz you never know what shape that camera is really in when you try and get the cheapest deal)..... I don't mind the price either because I opened up Best Buys credit card and put the camera, case and extra SD card on it (All totalled about $350 final) and anything over $299 is 6 months no interest. So THAT was a deal enough for me to just get it at Best Buy and not try to find the CHEAPEST deal.....I'll write more of a review once I take this on vacation in three weeks and after I've had more time to play with it further and really sit down and read the manual about all the settings.  :)So far this is the best P&S; I've seen to date!I wanted to make a note that I read a lot about people complaining about the indoor pics being too dark in the background when you use the flash. Mine works fine and lights up what needs to light up. Of course the background is going to be dark when the flash focuses in on the main subject and lights that up. That just naturally happens with cameras. If I notice any sort of probs with mine I will make a note of it on here. But so far this camera works exactly how I wanted it to, has features I wanted AND more and FAR exceeded my expectations.", "Date": "May 18, 2008"}, {"Title": "Very nice camera - everything you need in a compact", "Author": "Michael J.

I also own a  Nikon D200 and several lenses for the brunt of my photography needs but I really needed/wanted a small pocket camera that would take nice photos and good video.  This is an excellent compliment to a DSLR.If this were my only camera, I would probably be missing the longer zooms, the wide angle that it covers is quite nice.My favorite feature though has to be the video and the on board controls for reviewing the videos.  It is just perfect for this, I coach High School athletes in the Pole Vault and this little camera is my best assistant. I have taken hundreds of videos so far and it just performs perfectly.Battery life has been exceptional in my opinion.The Cons:As noted by other reviewers the on/off button is easy to hit by accident.  So far I have not jammed the lens but I can see how easy it is to do.  I have inadvertently turned the camera on in my pocket a number of times.Bottom Line:Highly Recommended Camera.

This camera is really easy to use and figure out.The design itself is sleek and simple. Don't let the simple design fool you though, this little thing has a ton of options to work with. The wide angle pictures and image stabilization are the features that lured me into buying this beauty. Another thing was the awesome price.I was really only looking for a point and shoot that would help me take some pictures of things at work for documentation purposes. For that purpose it is beyond anything that I could have imagined for. The options are awesome and let you fit into almost any situation you may run into.Never before have I owned a digital camera of my own. This is a first for me so I was under the impression that I would need a lotta work to get the pictures just right. Not with the Image Stabilization working like a charm. Also the ISO options help a ton with this. The Wide Angle pictures also look stunning when taking picutres of a nice horizon scene.The battery lasts about a week while taking picture on and off. I carry my camera everywhere I go so it varies depending on what I see. But on average the battery will last me 7-10 days. Charging it takes about 2 hours. Buying another one will be necessary when vacationing. Getting stuck without a battery is not an option when you have such a good camera =)One thing that I will say about this package is that you will need to also buy an SD card to accomodate you properly. I got the camera and saw that it came with only a small 32MB card. I promply bought 2 SanDisk 2 GB SDSDX3-2048-901 Extreme III SD Memory Card (Retail Package) and can say that it should last me a good while. Even with the pictures on max settings I still get about 500-600 pictures for each 2GIG card.In the end I can't say how pleased I am with this purchase. It's totally peaked my interest in photography and has let me see things in a new light. I have never delved into the photography scene however.

Usually travel with a big SLR. Took this on a trip, shot over 480 pictures & 12 videos over the course of a week on a single battery charge. Mostly automatic, point & shoot.  LCD large, bright enough for daylight use. Focus assist light illuminates shots and framing at night. None of the digital lag and pixellation that was so annoying on older LCD viewers. Big surprise: the pictures are GREAT!I think the pictures are actually sharper than the Canon digital Rebel. While there are several scene adjustments possible, I took lots of great pics in a variety of lighting conditions using auto point & shoot.  The camera picks settings on its own-- The only  times I needed to override were shooting through glass (bus windows, museum cases) and higher speed action (friends running).Color balance was great.  On standard settings, 5X7 & 8X10's look good.  Significantly better than Advantix film pix, in fact.In the past, I haven't used the video features of my digital cameras.  This one's a winner.  The little \"talkies\" from the trip were priceless.  The camera's up & running in about a second, so if you are a quick draw, you can catch action that you'd miss with a camcorder or minicamcorder.  The video quality is great on a PC, and good enough to watch on TV, yet it doesn't hog too much memory, or burn the battery.The big SLR guns are still the king for sports / action and heavy duty flash work.  For fun, travel, laughs and convenience, this is the one.I used a caseCanon PSC-55 Deluxe Leather Compact Case for SD430, SD500, SD550, SD600, SD630, SD700IS, SD800IS, SD850 IS, SD900,SD950IS & SD870IS Digital Camerason my belt to keep track of it.It's a few more $$ than a lot of the pocket cameras out there.  The only one I saw with comparable pictures was the Panasonic with a Leica lens. Others on our trip had Olympus and Kodak pocket cameras.  In the same light, same conditions, pics from this camera were the sharpest, had more vibrant color, and exposure was right on > 90% of the time.You can tell the difference between the cheap and faster memory cards.  With the high speed card, it shoots as fast as you can.  Image write time was noticeably slower with the $18.00 2 GB card, but movies still worked just fine.  The extra $6 for a good memory card is probably worth it.", "Date": "April 17, 2008"}, {"Title": "Wonderful little camera.

It is small enough to be carried anywhere all the time. Yet the picture quality is excellent ,especially at low ISO setting.  The 28mm equivalent focal length is very useful in tight space and scenery. for me this focal length and the excellent picture quality are the factors that I brought this camera.  The sharp 3 inch LCD screen make the camera a real joy to be used as a show and tell for the pictures that it has taken  The shutter response is relative fast but not the response speed of DSLR. If you intend to use the camera mainly to take pictures of kids running around, DSLR is still a better choice.  It has more than enough scene mode to take care of 99% of the shooting condition. If that is not enough, there is always exposure compensation.  The IS function is really useful. You can hand held at about 3 stops lower than what you normally can without the IS. The face recognition function works most of the time, Once in a blue moon ,it will not recognize the face.  The movie function work great also. Too bad that you cannot use the optical zoom in the movie mode. However, the digital zoom is available for movie mode. However the picture quality will be degraded if the zooming ratio is too high. If you intend to use the movie function a lot, buy a fast SD card with 4 G capacity.  The flash is slightly on the weak side. So use long focal length for the head shorts and use short focal length for group of people.  There is a lot of feature for this camera. So reading the instruction book at least 3 times is highly recommended.  Since I have stated so many good thing about this camera. It is only fair for me to point out things that I do not like. I agree with the other reviewer that the power switch can be turned on accidentally. Canon should have use the same recessed power switch from the SD800 IS. Also both the battery compartment door and the door for the I/O ports are too  Cheaply made for my taste.  But please do not let the above two things steer you away from buying the SD870 IS.

I have found a unique strength of this camera that I think is worth sharing (although admittedly it may only appeal to small subsection of users).  First of all, I bought the camera initially for the birth of my daughter 18 months ago and have been astonished at it's functionality as a point and shoot camera.  I have taken 1000's (literally) of pix of the baby growing throughout the past year and a half.  Inside, outside, low light, bright light it shines over the 10 mp kodak that it has replaced.  I don't really print the pictures, I primarily view them via our plasma and lcd tv's and let me tell you at looking at pictures in 1080p on 40\" screen is the true acid test of a good camera.  However, I got the greatest surprise when I happened to bring this camera to see some live music and decided to fire up the video.  The video is adequate (not stellar) but I have found that the audio recording capability is pretty amazing.  I typically see indie bands playing at high volume in small clubs - this camera has yet be defeated with any sort of audio overload.  I'm a youtuber so I sometimes check other video's from ytube before going to a show and have found that where other video cameras fail, this one shines.  People comment frequently about the audio and ask how/why there is no overload like other vids of the same band (or even from the same show).  You can check it out at my Youtube channel here: [...] (although be warned that some of the music is a bit ah, unique, extreme and may not be to everyone's taste)  Black Dice, Mogwai and the Crystal Method where at especially high volumes and most people there actually wore earplugs.  Anyhow, I've had great luck with this camera and would highly recommend it as a point and shoot or for great video/audio.

My brother bought the lower end model SD1100 which is also great, but after some researching I bought this high end model SD870.I immediately fell in love with Canon's simplicity design and ease of use of the menu features. Only Sony cameras are easier to use (Sony's menu is definitely the easiest).I won't talk about specifications or numbers in this review as many others have done so already.I just want to say it simple - this camera can be set on automatic and will take great photos for you, which is a rare when a camera is set to automatic. But if you want to change some of the features, this camera offers great manual controls. I usually change the exposure - makes the photo lighter or darker, or I change the metering - center position mostly. Sometimes I change the colors to manual and adjust it myself, but I recommend you leave it on auto, it does the job good. On other cameras I usually change the white balance, but on this one there is no need, the auto function does the job perfectly, although there is a manual option.Overall it does great photos during the day and really good photos during the night or in dark indoor places.I also tried shooting the camera while driving and amazingly the photos came great, no blurred images, or objects out of focus as with other cameras.Here I mention some goods and bads:Good:1. Very fast shooting speeds and start up time.2. Great quality of photos when using the Auto function (a rare).3. Very good photos during night shots or when moving.4. Delayed shooting option - gives you a personalized option where you can choose how many times the camera to take a photo - great feature, I use it all the time. Just set it lets say on 3 photos with a delay of 10 seconds and place the camera where you want for a family photo, then press the button and join the group - after 10 seconds it will take 3 snaps so tell every one not to move away before the final 3rd shot. This way you'll have 3 photos in case 1 or 2 of them are bad (if someone blinked) surely the 3rd one must be good!5. Long battery life.6. Uses the cheap SD card (unlike Sony which uses the expensive Memory Stick card).7. Lots of manual controls if you like changing the settings.8. Strong flash - good for photos in huge dark places like in the club, at a bar, etc.9. Great Video quality - may be the best of all small camera I've tested.10. Very well working Image Stabilizer.11. You can change the type of picture you want to take - the biggest 8 Megapixel photo, or lower megapixels in case you don't want big file size for the photo (when you just need it to upload it to Facebook for example), or you can choose the 16:9 photos - my favorite - great panoramic photos for wide screen TVs and Monitors.12. Orientation Sensor - flip the camera and the photo rotates.13. Some other useful features: Face Detection, Timelapse recording (I never used it), Metering (Evaluative, Center Weighted, Spot).Bad:1. No Flash Level adjust feature.You cannot adjust the strength of the flash - this is really the only thing that bugged me for a long time. As I mentioned this camera has a very strong flash which is good for taking snaps in big indoor places, but if you want to take a photo when its dark of just one or two people and they are very close to the camera the flash is so strong it makes the color of their faces and skin almost white! You should be able to adjust the level of flash like on almost all other cameras I've owned, including my older Sony DSC-W55. What I do in those cases is I lower the exposure level and then take a photo, thus the flash automatically lowers its level, but still it's kind of strong.2. Red eyes (normal for small cameras).I use the program ACDSee Photo Manager 2009 to remove the red eyes (and lots of other detail fixing) - if you need a great EASY TO USE program I recommend you try ACDSee Photo Manager 2009!3. A little bigger and heavier than current models, but still very small and compact.4. No Viewfinder (but a great big 3-inch screen).5. Small range wide angle (with bigger range wide angle you can take a real close up photo and catch more scene in it). This camera has a Zoom Wide 28 mm(milliliters), and Zoom Tele 108 mm (3.8x) compared to another Canon model SD890IS which has respectively 37 mm and 185 mm (5x).By the way the best website to compare digital camera specs is [...]Overall I think this is my favorite compact Point and Shoot camera.

The camera behaved flawlessly and took over 450 photos and 10 videos without a hitch. The only errors were self inflicted by the photographer.

The camera traveled everywhere from Z\u00fcrich, Thun and Zermatt. I like the size and the ability to take pictures anywhere and at any time.

My son had just purchased a Canon SD870IS for the same trip because it has a 28 mm wide angle. So I purchased one also from Amazon.The camera is fantastic. I discovered the SD870IS can take video and you can stitch still photos together to create panoramics.I took several hundred closeup photos of animals. The 3.8 zoom lens, with night photo feature, captured the faces  and yellow eyes of the 2 lionesses and the lion that crept bye about 3 feet from our open Land Rover as they were sneaking up on a herd of Impala deer. Also the exasperated look on the face of a sleepy mother leopard being pestered for attention by her cub.However, at the end of the 2 week vcation trip, the lens retracted and extended more and more slowly when I turned off/on the camera.  A fully charged battery did not correct the problem and the lens failed to function at the end when I tried to take the final two (unimportant) photos.  (My son's Canon SD870IS worked/is still working perfectly).I contacted Amazon Customer Service when I returned home.  Since I had only had the camera 3 weeks Amazon immediately rushed me a replacement SD870IS.The image stabilization was huge help as our land rover plowed through bush and gullies following elephants, Cape Buffalos, Rhinos. hipposI found I could hold the camera (and my Panasonic CamCorder) more stable in my right hand if I grasped my right wrist with my left hand and kept both arms braced against my chest.I am very happy with Canon, the Canon SD870IS [...].", "Date": "May 29, 2008"}, {"Title": "Best Camera Ever!!!", "Author": "Juanetta \"Smart Shopper\"", "ReviewID": "R2G19FQDI5VL3T", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I bought a Sony Cybershot before buying this camera because the Sony was cheaper.

I love the manual controls on this camera, the actual usefulness of the preset scene modes, battery life, etc. I'd have to say the best feature by far is the detailed playback mode showing the brightness histogram and areas of oversaturation. It's tough to tell how your shot really turned out until you download to a large screen or print, and nothing's worse than finding out the blue sky in your picture recorded as a wash of white. With the detailed playback, I can see how the shot turned out, adjust the exposure compensation and white balance as necessary, reshoot, and viola! the perfect shot! I've confirmed on my laptop, TV, and from the printer. Sizing up the other issues most reviewers gripe or rave about:LCD/lack of viewfinder--I always appreciated a viewfinder to get the best shots, but the crispness of the LCD in sunlight-or-less coupled with the above function eliminate the need for one.Ease of use--very good. In auto mode does well, in manual mode does better. There are alot of tricks you can pull out of your hat in non-obvious ways, which makes it non-idiot-proof, but it's nice to have them there.Barrel distortion--haven't noticed it and have been looking for itWide angle--its nice. eliminates the need to stich two pics together. don't think it's the right reason to buy the camera, but a bonus nonethelessMacro shots--my biggest gripe (along with most p&s; on the market). everything at the focal point is clear and crisp, everything else is unrecognizable. I don't know why this happens--my old 2MP Fuji p&s; brick gets everything, including the focused macro shot.

For one it has  a lot of great features.1.  Great Megapixels (You can blow up the image really big without losing any clarity)2.  Great Video:  30 FPS at good resolution that shows up very crisp on my computer screen and TV.  It is very easy to put the video in slow motion, which I use to look at my golf swing, which it captures very well.  Also you can do a movie mode which takes a picture once every 1 or 2 seconds which is good for clouds passing over and other good stuff.3.  Color Accent Mode, it is very neat to select a color of something and have that be the only color that shows up in the picture.4.  Wide Angle Lens, Definately makes a difference.5.  Great Screen, this does not take too much battery life, I recorded a lot of video and took probably close to 300 photos on one charge, but being one person who charges something when its only about half full, I consider I probably could have stretched the life out further.6.  Ease of Use:  Right out of the box it was easy to figure out how to do certain things with the camera, I used to have a Sony before this and it is about the same to operate it.  I did have to look in the book for a couple minutes to figure out how to do color accent and some other speacial camera modes, but it is all still very simple.7.  It comes with AV cables, and its easy to transfer pictures to the computer and view them.Overall I am very happy I bought this camera on Amazon, I saved almost $60.00 over other retailers and I have no regrets about my purchase.", "Date": "February 6, 2008"}, {"Title": "Very good subcompact wide angle camera", "Author": "Rick", "ReviewID": "R2RQ6ZKSPWIEEF", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I have this camera for about a month already and it is very good.

Most times I really only need a single shot to capture a scene rather than a stitch of two scenes... this camera does just that with its wide-angle lens. In that mode there is very little barrel distortion, too.The zoom isn't great at about 3x but then again I don't really that. I take mostly \"snapshots\" and this point-and-shoot not only garnered Consumer Reports as being highly rated but also my rating.I also spend time documenting underground mining scenes and I found the flash more than adequate (despite others' comments), but, more importantly, the camera projects a red dot so that the imaging software can correctly focus on the scene -- that is invaluable to me.Red-eye reduction seemed ineffective at a wedding that I was at; the feature of detecting smiling faces was incredibly precise.The software (menu system) is a little clunky and counter-intuitive, but so was transitioning from Windows 98 to XP, right? I'll get used to it in time.Boot-up time is phenomenally fast, pictures are taken rapidly, focus is rapid, picture quality is excellent (an 8 MP image takes about 4 MB card space -- detail is not sacrificed).So why only the 4-star rating? In moderately low light the software shifts to a low shutter speed, one slow enough that, say, if a breeze is rustling branches then they are captured as blurred. In my photographs, however, I have not experienced the graininess that others have experienced at similar lighting conditions.I haven't yet evaluated the movie or time-lapse movie modes so I cannot report on them... but, for a compact camera with great battery life and an awesome wide-angle lens, I am more than pleased with my purchase.It is my understanding that there is now a slightly more improved version of this camera... probably worth checking out for the few extra pesos...Now, as far as the Canon software goes, hmmm... it needs some work (and I need to familiarize myself with it more), but it does the job that I need: download the pictures from the camera, auto-rotate portrait images, and then save them. I use 3rd party paint programs for any editing so I cannot comment on the ability of the supplied software to handle that... I am a \"minimalist\" of sorts in that regards. It took me a few minutes to figure out what I needed to do from the non-standard user interface, but I did figure it out and the pictures drop into my selected folder properly rotated -- what more could I want?

Recently, my S30 was stolen from the car.  Here were my requirements before I bought the SD870: <28mm wide angle, compact size, image stabilization, fast performance, good image quality & manual controls. Due to the scarce choices, I had to compromise the manual control feature and came up with the SD870.  It had the above great attributes less the manual control (shutter speed/aperture) ability.  SD870 takes excellent photos under most well lighted settings as already covered by many other reviews; here are my tips/notes for the less lighted settings:1) When normal flash is used(slow sync off), the shutter speed is fixed at 1/60 sec(too fast); this explains why the photos turns out darker when using a flash at certain settings than no flash. This setting is good for not very dark setting.2) When slow synch flash is used, the shutter speed could get much slower so it would capture much better amount of light.  When lighting is very dark, the shutter speeds would go up to 1 sec(too slow to hold by hand); at this speed, you must use the tripod to avoid blurry photos.  Play with the slow sync option and you'll be surprised at how different the photos would turn out.3) When \"night snapshot\" mode is used, the ISO is fixed at 250 and shutter at 1/8 sec. A very useful mode to use. I set this mode as my default \"scn\" mode; when you slide the slider on top of the camera to the middle. I wish the ISO is fixed at 200 for less noise and shutter at 1/6.4) In manual mode, you can adjust the shutter speed only from 1~15 sec; I wish Cannon allowed the control from 1/20~15 sec. But better than nothing. Great feature for very low light and must use a tripod.5) Decent photo quality when ISO is 80~200; so in most situations, try to lock the ISO at as low as possible to obtain the best quality photos.  You may have to use continuous mode to capture multiple shots and choose the best ones & use shutter delay 1 second to avoid hand shake.When not using tripod, always turn the image stabilizer to continuous.  You can still get a clear photo @ 1/2 sec shutter (1 out of 2 or 3 shots).6) Customize the share botton to \"exposure\" control for convenience.

And with the vivid color setting on it really makes for some deep and rich blues and greens. There are other cool color settings like color accent and color switch that are fun to play with.- Video is great as well at 30fps. You can make videos as long as you want. It would have been nice to have a stereo mic but that's me just being super picky.- The 3\" LCD display is beautiful and puts other cameras to shame. It makes for some great previewing.

It can be easy sometimes to turn it on inside the case and the lens will try to extend. Yikes. Just be careful when you put it away and you'll be fine.You won't be disappointed by this camera!

I try to avoid the night setting and just use portrait or auto. I'm not super camera savvy so I may not be the best judge on that. But for the most part the camera takes excellent pictures. I mainly use the camera for taking picutres with friends and scenery. I really don't see how any one would not like this camera other than wishing it could be more slim.

It has some neat features like a built-in rain hood and a belt loop that doesn't require taking off your belt.

Cross", "ReviewID": "RZETF1CE27AF5", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I'm just going to hit on a couple things because everything has been said many times. This is a Canon Sd series camera, so it's basically the same as other Sd series that cost less/more. I didn't know which one to get so i ordered both an 750 & 850 to test them out against my Sd1000 & Sd 400 The main point of this is what are you buying the camera for?1. For all the digi-logic IX cam face following more monkey pixels yada yada both of these have they took the same pictures as my Sd1000 & Sd400. I tested all cameras in probably 10-15 situations and to tell you the truth I couldn't tell the difference just looking at them. My Sd400/1000 have both been dropped, serviced, fallen in pools...etc and there was no real difference. Some super photo pro could probably find some things, but if you're going to take this camera out and shoot you and your friends having a good time the more expensive camera probably isn't going to make that much of a difference...so don't over obsess about it.2. The 870 uses the nb-5L battery, which is NOT the same as my sd 400/1000, so another battery charger and I can't use my old batteries.3. This thing is kinda big. The more \"stuff\" and bigger zoom they pack in comes at a price with it's size. It's not huge or anything, and if you're going to keep it in a case/purse it probably doesn't matter, but I like to throw it in my jeans pocket and head out the door, and it's noticibly  bigger (TWSS).4. Some people say the Image Stablization is the greatest thing ever, some say it doesn't work at all; sign me up for the latter. In dark conditions it still gives blurry pics and in sunny ones it's still perfect, just like all Sds. IS works great in a SLR system but not compact (IMO).5. Little over a month old, took it out of my pocket, lens error, have to send it to get repaired. \"Should\" be free..but we'll see.6. With that 3\" screen it feels a little fragile...or maybe I'm just scared of injuring it because it's so big. This just doesn't feel as rugged and safe as my sd1000, which is $100 cheaper. Again this is situational, if you're super careful and carry a case and all that jazz no worries.7. So before this sounds all negative let me just say I really like this camera and am glad i got it (if it works again). Why? because the LCD is huge and the lens is WIDE angle. I've always had problems getting a lot of friends in the shot at the bar or hanging out and this is way better with this wide angle....that alone is worth it.8. One touch button for playback of pics; perfect!So I guess I'm saying don't get all caught up in how many mega pixels there are becasue you're really not gunna be able to tell the difference. If you like the bigger screen get this one. If you're inside taking pics of you and your friends mostly you will thank yourself for getting a wide angle. If you're really down to 2 cameras, just order them both and test them out for a day. It'll cost you $6 shipping but you'll know for sure.Good Luck", "Date": "May 19, 2008"}, {"Title": "Great wide-angle camera", "Author": "Dario", "ReviewID": "R2L74LYBHJ17SL", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Great camera if you are interested in wide-angle and macro features in a very compact design.The colors and skin tones are very realistic and the sharpness is wonderful.Very flexible and you can get even more control with a software like CHDK.The only cons I found is the lack of a real diaphragm (using a ND filter instead), so you can't really control the DoF, so if you are looking for a camera to get those portraits with blurred backgrounds, maybe you need to find a better optical zoom and a really aperture control, otherwise this is really a very enjoyable every-day camera.", "Date": "May 19, 2008"}, {"Title": "awesome", "Author": "Linda Degelmann \"Linda Fuller Degelmann\"", "ReviewID": "RLTXC46EXJ24G", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Canon PowerShot SD870IS 8MP Digital Camera is amazingly user-friendly.

I originally started looking for a small point and shoot camera to fit in an underwater case, for scuba diving.  I tried a Fuji 12mp, an Olympus 8mp, and finally a friends Kodak 8mp.  All the cameras had there advantages.  The Fuji finepix f50 se had a whopping 12mp and was a fairly quick camera, but the batter life was not that good.  The Fuji also took very noisey pictures.  Even at low iso.  So I moved to the New 08 Olympus stylus 840.  It had 5x optical, it was 8mp, 2.5in lcd. Battery life was really bad!  Picture wise it took better pics than the Fuji.  A lot less noise, but a lot of blurry pics.  The Kodak I tried out was a little bulky for a slim cam.  It took nice pictures, the batter life was good.  It just seems the color was off a little.  it also had a 2.5in lcd.  So after playing with all these cameras and being very disappointed I went for the Canon!  I knew Sony would have a better picture do to the crystal lens they use.  But I did not care for how the camera settings were set up.  After using the Canon sd 870 IS I fell in love.  It is very fast.  Battery life is great!  its got a nice 3.0in lcd.  That was very important for me since I planed on taking it underwater.  It has a very nice wide lens that most cameras do not have in its class.  The only thing I do not like about it is the manual controls.  There are none.  I knew this going into the camera, but I was looking for a point and shoot.  \"The perfect camera\" is not out right now in my opinion.  If your looking for a fast camera that takes great pics I would get the SD 870 IS.  Pics have no noise at low iso.  the noise creeps up on ya at higher iso, but thats to be expected.  I have not taken any blurry pics yet!  It also takes great pictures underwater with the Canon housing.  Video is great too!  you can zoom while in video mode.  The transition from dark to light places is fast.  This camera is just plane GREAT!  This would be a great compact point and shoot next to any SLR.  I got this just in time for my Florida Keys diving trip.  All of my buddies were impressed by the camera's picture quality underwater.  One buddy has last years Canon 10mp and he was pissed that my camera took way better shots!  So thats it.  If your wondering if you should spend the cash on this, do it!

Abraham", "ReviewID": "R3UJ04XFSS7XOF", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "First off, I must say that my old SD400 was AWESOME.  That camera takes pictures with the best of them.  I had to buy a new one because my zoom broke.Both the sd870is and the sd950is are great cameras.  I like Canons, but shopped Casio, Nikon, and Olympus, so I wouldn't be ignorant to what else was out there.  Clarity-wise, they were all good.  I chose Canon for the warmth/color of the pics.  If you're that type, then don't bother with the other makes.Sidenote:  If you're a youtube junkie, take a hard look at the Casio Exlim - it had the most web-friendly video recorder I've seen to date...and made me wonder why Canon doesn't get on the ball in that area.Since the 870 and 950 got great reviews, the value became more of a factor.  Why would I pay almost $100 more for one model?  After a lot of contemplating and research, here were the decision factors for me:1)  Photo resolution:  The 950is gave me more MP.  However, I have a DSLR too, so that wasn't critical.  Plus, the 870is would blow up to 8x10 or 11x14, no problem...which was as large as I would go in the house.  So if you want max resolution, or will enlarge beyond that, I'd go 950.2)  Video resolution.  The 950 has the cool factor of filming \"HD\"...720p I believe.  This is great if you are connecting to a TV, or if your clips are less than 15 seconds.  However, if you will do web uploads (myspace, facebook, youtube)...then it's worth noting that neither Canon writes video very efficiently.  The best way to explain it is a very fast, smooth animation (collection of still images in motion).  The HD resolution in the 950 makes the file size even larger, and the video quality of the 870 was great.  So if you want bragging rights, go 950is.  Otherwise, take a hard look at both.3.  28mm wide angle.  I didn't realize how important this was to me until I took it on vacation.  If you don't do scenic photos, or use a DSLR for that, then it's not as important.  But if you do, this feature alone might make you choose the 870.4.  Screen.  The lack of a little viewfinder in the 870 (typically in other cameras) didn't matter to me, because I never used it.  I liked the larger screen.5.  Price.I would recommend the 950is if you're going to enlarge beyond 11x14, want to record HD video today (without buying an HD camera), and want bragging rights to the top of the line model.You probably can tell I chose the 870is...and it's been great.  For the most part, both cameras have the same weaknesses, and the gap in strengths wasn't enough to warrant the gap in price.4/5 is because Canon can't get it together on the video recording...and because pictures with flash just won't catch any of the background.", "Date": "June 2, 2008"}, {"Title": "downed but not out", "Author": "lucky13 \"lucky13\"", "ReviewID": "R38EZG4Q9OQ3PK", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "i got this camera on wed and dropped it on thrumy heart skipped a beatshould have heard all the four letter words i was thinkingnothing happened to itjust like it came out of the box", "Date": "December 22, 2007"}, {"Title": "Dreaded Lens Error...SD870IS is a Ticking Time Bomb", "Author": "fouroclock", "ReviewID": "RZC0CNPW86F4I", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "This was my first CANON purchased back in 3/08 and just got the dreaded lens error today.

I did not see this coming at all and don't recall reading about this prior to purchasing. But after a little Googling, there are a ton of reports by consumers about this error, NOT ONLY WITH THE 870, but with MANY POINT&SHOOTS; by CANON. I've previously owned an OLYMPUS and SONY P&S;, and never had any problems with breaking down.This camera has just about everything you would want in a point & shoot (ie, wide-angle lens, large preview screen, quality movie mode, multi-focus points, image-stabilization), but it's really a ticking time bomb, since you never know when the lens error will render the camera useless. Many consumers have reported that CANON WILL NOT fix the problem for free, even if it's under warranty...I have serious problems with that.I hope others don't take this review as a disgruntled consumer complaining about an issue that doesn't happen all that much.

It happened for both the new DCs and the old ones. Most of these customers had to contact the support center and wait for a couple of weeks before getting it back.Lucky for me, it turned out that after I charged the battery for a couple of minutes and put it back, the camera worked as great as it could be. The shooting is much faster than my old SD600, the screen is huge, and the photo stitching is a lot of fun.So most likely, the initial problem could be from the compatibility  between new battery and the camera. Still, such thing never happened on any of my other cameras, never.

This pinching of the image makes it less desirable for people looking to document artwork or those looking to take precise architectural images where right angles matter.

As far as point-and-shoots go, it's great, however, it's a point-and-shoot and has those limitations:The good:- Takes great quality photos for a point-and-shoot, even on the preset modes- For someone like me, who doesn't know how to use an SLR, it's easy enough to use the manual features like exposure controls and long-shutter- The wide lens is great for group shots or outside shots- The stabilizer helps a great deal on taking shots; my previous camera didn't have one and I had way more blurry shots- In proper light, the movie quality is pretty good at 640x480.  With an 8 gig-card, it's not bad for a cheap video camera replacement, though by no means is it a camcorder- It's tiny and can fit easily into jeans, which is great for guys, as we don't care purses (at least most guys)- The wheel is actually touch sensitive, which I don't think Canon points out, but if you have a big memory card (I have an 8 GB), it's the best way to scroll through photos really quickly- The LCD is great and I've never had issues using it, even outdoors in bright sun (and in California that is important)The bad:- It's a point-and-shoot so the flash sucks.  I have the external flash add-on, but it's cumbersome to carry and kind of defeats the purpose of having a tiny camera.  This is to be expected of a camera this size- Because of the small size, there is slight barrel distortion, but it's really not a big deal- The camera does scratch easily.  While it fits in your pocket, if you have keys it will scratch the camera.  My first one got really scuffed up after I left it in pocket one day.  Now I don't put anything else in the pocket with it, or use the case, which is somewhat bulky- Above ISO400 the image quality is really poor, so taking night photos without a tripod is not easy unless the subjects are close enough for the flash--but no point-and-shoot can really do thisAfter a year of using this camera I have to say I really happy with it, especially after learning more about how I, as a user, can take better photos in general.  Here are some tips I've found:- If you're taking photos with the flash, set your mode to macro if you're very close and infinity if the subject is more than 4 meters away, it makes a difference.  For close shots, use macro mode and zoom into the subject so the light from the flash doesn't bounce off the object too quickly- If you're taking night shots, use the red aimer thing to make sure there is somewhere to bounce the light off.  If, for example, you are taking a picture of someone, the best thing to do outside is to flash the light towards a pole or object just behind, this way the flash doesn't go on their face (and have that whitening effect), and bounces back fast enough to take a clear shot- For proper night shots you need to use a tripod.  If the objects aren't moving that much long shutter is the best way to do this, but it takes a long time and any camera shake will screw it up.  To get long shutter, go to the exposure setting and press display to get to long shutter- Learn some basics about taking photographs, it really helps.  Higher ISOs make it easier to take stable shots, but they make the photos grainier.  Natural light, if possible, takes more accurate photos than the flash, as the flash whitens, don't stay too close to your subject, use the zoom (it will distort the faces, especially the nose as the light doesn't bounce back evenly).  I never bothered to learn this things and 10 minutes of reading makes your photos so much better- Take practice shots.  Too many of my group photos (I take many) were dark or didn't have the right light in the past, and many times it is because I didn't want to take test shots to calibrate.  If you're at a restaurant the waiter or waitress will take one or two shots, so if you want it to count have it set up beforehand, it's the only way to be sure- Remember this isn't an SLR--it's a great point-and-shoot and takes great photos, but if you want that beautiful \"pro\" look you need an SLR and you need to know how to use it", "Date": "December 24, 2008"}, {"Title": "I love this camera", "Author": "Joyce \"airtips\"", "ReviewID": "RDTI85HN606GK", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I absolutely love my Cannon PowerShot SD870IS camera.

I've not yet found a camera that is perfect for everything, and for what this camera does well, together with its portability and ease of use, I've been very pleased.With only a 3.8x zoom, I know I'm not going to get the distant mountain wildlife shot, but with the clarity and stunning color I get in decent light, the 8mp quality allows me to zoom in and enlarge a portion of a picture pretty well when I'm photo editing on the computer later.

It looks as if there's something on the lens, but that's not the case. I see this is an issue in many other forums.Another big issue is that the red-eye reduction is terrible on this camera.

With a tripod and a bit of time to learn proper ISO and exposure settings, the camera created some nice nighttime pictures as well. The battery life is good, easily able to handle a full day of picture taking, even with the screen at its brightest, and charging is quick and simple.I found the camera to be very sensitive to single point light sources at night and even during the day (the sun) producing excessive amounts of lens flare.  One annoyance is the camera does not remember your flash settings when you turn it off, and always defaults to on.  Also, the silver finish has gotten fairly scratched up from my abuse, but I kept the large screen safe with an invisibleSHIELD.  The zoom isn't spectacular, at 3.8x, but it's usually not much of a concern.  Some people may not like that it does not have an optical viewfinder, but the large screen really makes up for it, and I personally would never use an optical viewfinder anyway --even to save battery.Overall I'd say the Canon PowerShot SD870IS is an excellent camera for the price, producing excellent quality images for a point and shoot.", "Date": "December 11, 2008"}, {"Title": "Good Camera For Outdoors, Bad for Indoors/Flash", "Author": "Bargain hunter", "ReviewID": "R1MTQGI3KNMPL9", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Its a good camera overall (I like Canon products).

Biggest thing I like about this camera is that it has a wider angle than any of the other ones. Mostly, the wife and kids shoot indoors or in a close setting. The wider angle allows for them to get more into the picture. They take great pictures and if/when we really need a good shot I have a Canon Digital SLR I use. So, it really works out great. They all have loved them, they're fairly easy to operate and if you want to get a bit more advanced, they also have that capability. Obviously, as I now have 3, I'd recommend them to anyone. In a close, say under 50', setting, you really can't tell the difference between their pictures shot with a $250.00+ camera or mine with $3500 between the camera and lense.

Picture to picture is about .9 sec. And start up to first picture is about 1.4 sec. There also is a myriad of settings that are fun to use. The 870 also uses sd cards which was important to me because I have three of those and didn't want to buy new memory cards to fit in other cameras like the new sony's. Other advantages of the 870 is that it has image stablizier and face recognition which is helpful in focusing on people and keeping things in focus. Overall the camera is great for those everyday shots and even for individuals who like to explore the cameras settings. The camera has a few downsides. I've noticed that sometimes its hard to take pictures that are in focus. Sometimes I've really had to work and take several pictures to get one in focus.

So the video capture still take some prior mental planning if you use the zoom a lot..2. I have a 8GB SD card..

Amazon had one of the better prices and most importantly I trusted Amazon to stand behind the purchase. I've read some horror stories about some of the cut-rate website \"storefront\" places. I'm not saying you can only buy from Amazon but make sure you check out reviews on whoever you make a purchase like this from.The pictures are very clear. I moved up from a 3.2 meg digital camera so I expected improvement. I also had to spend a little time getting used to no viewfinder. But the display is very bright and I've quickly adjusted. I'd like to have both, but I appreciate the compact size of the Canon. I take more pictures because I always have my camera with me.The zoom button took a little time getting used to but nothing inconvenient. I am also satisfied with the zoom features.

The image stabilization feature is great, and so are the different camera modes. I can easily impress friends using the color accent mode which is my favorite. Pictures are clean and crisp. Most digital cameras I used previously had issues taking pictures in the dark. The SD870 does a great job even in the dark, though it does not eliminate red eye (there is an in-camera red-eye removal tool to handle that problem). The wide angle lens captures more in a frame than a regular digital camera would, and that's great when you are taking group pictures. Battery life is good. I also purchased a 2gb SD card so I wouldn't have to worry about how many pictures to store. When I bought the SD870, I was looking for a digital camera that was small enough to fit in my pocket, had good image stabilization, decent zoom and could take great pictures even in dark settings.

I could easily fit in 6 people in a frame when other camera would fit only 4 from the same distance.The image stabilization is 99.99% effective too!And its unique 3 inch LCD screen and the black panel on the back looks so cool!! Believe me when i say that you can see images on the screen even in very bright sunlight making the view finder irrelevant!  Hardly anybody uses the viewfinder anyway!Another cool feature is the self time- comes with 3 options including a custom setting where you can set it to click up to 10 times at one one go!! That could be very useful when you have to take pictures of a large groups.Many other features are common to most canon SD series. Auto ISO is effective but not perfect. Exposures in the the dark may be not very good if it's anywhere more than 5 feet away.

I purchased this camera to replace a 4 year old kodak and after a weeklong camping vacation I will say this is a great little camera. Compact and wide angle are the key features and well worth it.  Expansive vistas and tight canyon views just cannot be done this easily with a normal lens. Slight bending at the edges with the lens at its shortest length but acceptable.  Small size and quick startup makes it easiy to palm during activities.  I would now never choose smaller than a 4GB SDHC card - allows lots of photos and movies, quick too.  But don't forget this camera is delicate and needs care.  A silicone cover may make holding it a bit more secure.  A small Gorilla Pod made this great fun for self portraits.  The face detect seems pretty good and selection of scenes will take time to learn ... or not.  AF doesn't always choose the correct object but not horrible. IS is probably critical on a camera this size but transparent in operation.Overall: great sub compact camera for backbacking photos in wide open spaces and narrow slot canyons. Pair with small Gorilla pod, a 12V car battery charger and you have a super fun and versatile iMovie machine - if not a bit delicate.Sept 2009 update.  Love this camera.

It's not absurdly high like some other models, and so the noise performance of this camera is still pretty good. It takes reasonably noise free shots at 400ISO.

I think this is an important feature for people who are taking pics in close quarters.Battery life seems admirable. My wife can use the camera on several occasions before the battery needs to be recharged.I personally find the menu system of the camera a little obtuse. It's just not clear what functions will be under what menu, and they seem to change based on the mode. In some modes there is more control than others. (In no mode is there full control of shutter and aperture, though you do have access to exposure compensation).A final minor complaint is that there is this control wheel thingy that is a circle that you can click on the top, bottom, left, and right of to activate functions. However, you can also use the circle like a wheel, spinning your finger clockwise and counterclockwise to access functions. My experience is that this just doesn't work very well.

With this camera you can just point and shoot to get good pictures; you can also read the manual and learn to use the many features.  5 stars.

The face detection works quite well but more important is the fact that I have used this everywhere from a dark restaurant at night to mid-day and am very happy with the photos taken.

It allows picture taking to be as simple as pressing the button or choosing customized presets for different shooting variables. I was very happy with the picture quality with the 610 and the 870 is even better.  The only complaint I have is with Canon's software. In a nutshell, it stinks. I had a problem installing the previous version of ZoomBrowser which required many emails with Canon's Tech Support and much time installing, uninstalling, editing the registry and numerous other tweaks to get it to run.

The buttons were moved around to make them easier to use, and the screen has icons that pop up to easily let you change options without worrying if you are pushing the right buttons. Also, the face recognition and focusing software works great. I always like the Elph because it is rugged and compact so that I can carry it in my pocket. I find that it lasts better than other cameras, and especially having the rechargeable battery pack rather than AA's somehow makes it tougher. The battery will last for probably about 500 pictures, which is plenty for most purposes. I took my old Elph on a long camping trip, and it was the only camera that didn't malfunction at least once (of about 15 cameras total) even though it took a lot of wear and tear.One downside of this camera are that it doesn't photograph well in low light. On my old one, the cover for the compartment on the bottom for the memory card and battery loosened so that it was hard to keep it closed (which needs to be closed in order for the camera to function), and I notice that this camera has the same cover, but that is something that will only get worse as the camera gets older.

The reason I went with the 870 is the wide angle lens which the S80 also had. I wish the lens was longer for telephoto shots. In comparison to the S80, the 870 indoor shots have better exposure, probably due to the higher ISO speeds. I like the weight and size of the S80 better than the 870 but that's personal preference. The 870 is so small, (not much to hold on to) that I'm afraid of dropping it. I would give it five stars (which is perfect) if it had more telephoto capability.

One big advantage for industrial work is the A650 swing-out, rotating LCD screen, but that is not important for home/family use. The speed of both cameras between pictures is great, flash recovery, everything.PROBLEMS: I am a control freak, so when I plug the camera into the USB port, I expect every functionality of Explorer; not the case. you cannot move pics from your PC to the camera for instance, so get a SD flashcard reader and pull the memory when you want to get your pics and movies.

The colors are extremely vivid on the LCD but the actual pictures lack the same intensity. The pictures are excellent though, just don't expect the LCD to give you a good \"color\" indication on what the photos will look like, your PC will give a better example. All features seem readily accessible ( I say \"seem\" because the options are similar to the other two cameras I mentioned and I don't really have any other experience with different manufacturers' models) and the images are quick to adjust. I especially appreciate the readily accessible custom white balance feature when the Auto White Balance options just don't seem to cut it. The 4x6\" prints that the SD870 produces in Fine mode are of good quality and I can't wait to try a larger print.

I've had the S400, S500, SD500, SD550, SD800IS and now the SD870IS.  Most of my family have also bought these cameras.  What I like is that once you have learned to use one, it's very easy to move up to another one of their cameras and the learning curve is short and sweet.  I have never had much of a complaint about these cameras.  I thought about not having the viewfinder but then realized I almost never used it on my previous cameras, so it's no big loss.  They say this camera is heavier than previous models but they all weigh about the same.  It is slightly larger though because it just barely fits in my Coach case made for these Canon's.  I also notice that this model has more black plastic than others, especially on that battery/SD slot door.  Fortunately they have never broken on me.  Build quality, picture quality is as good as any of their previous models.  My wife and kids along with myself really love these cameras so I doubt I'll switch to anything else anytime soon.  In fact I only research the Canon cameras when I plan to buy another one.  I don't bother with any of the others.  If you're looking for one of these Canon's, just pick the one in your budget range because they are all good.  I can't think of one that you would not be happy with.  They really packed a lot into these small cameras.  I really like the color swap, color accent, the Vivid, Black and White and Sepia photos.  The possibilities for creative photos in camera are endless, and easy.  Get one and start having some fun.  By the way, none of the 1/2 dozen or so Canon Elph's I've owned, or my spouses, kids, etc. have ever had a problem with their Canon, not one.  I even dropped one on concrete once and I just picked it up and continued taking photos (BUT DON'T DO THAT, it's a sick feeling).  Fortunately it only got a small scratch on the side of the camera and it didn't land on the open lens.  I noticed too that prices have dropped for these cameras, they are much more affordable now.  Just make sure you buy from a responsible, reputable dealer that you trust.  It's sometimes better to pay a little extra just to protect yourself from some online dealers that sell cameras not intended for US sales, thus you probably don't get a legitimate warranty.

Camera starts up very quickly. Wide angle lens means you can take pictures with more content in the frame which is excellent when taking pictures of kids. When you need it you can take good quality video which, even when expanded on my 24 inch Mac, looks perfectly acceptable.Cons:By default placing your finger over a button shows a graphic of that button on the screen which gets in the way of the picture you are taking. I found it unnecessary and annoying but it was easy enough to switch off.Biggest problem I have had is with the software that came with it. The downloading software works without a problem but the image browser (which is like a picture explorer/finder) doesn't work with my Mac; the first time I load it up on the computer it works fine but after that it crashes on start up. When I did use it, I liked it but now its just an annoyance as after downloading I have to deal with a dialog box which informs me the program has crashed. I also run Skype and think it may be a conflict with the built in isight. Still...fact is that, for whatever reason, it doesn't work.I have seen good reviews for the Sony but I wasn't impressed by the smeary screen and the clumsy touch screen.

The Minolta took great pictures, but it's bulky size made it impractical for carrying around and packing in a suitcase.The SD870IS is a nice size and easily fits in your pocket, purse, laptop bag, backpack... whatever.  Because of it's small size, most features can be accessed with one hand.The unit comes with some great features such as photo-stitching for panoramic pictures, color replacement, burst mode, etc... The zoom is acceptable for small environments, but doesn't quite cut it for something like taking a picture of a bird in a tree.The picture quality is good enough for casual pictures, but despite the 8MP CCD it pales in comparison to our old 5MP SLR-style camera.  Lesson learned?  It's about the lens, not the MP.  Low-light performance leaves something to be desired, but this is probably another function of the lens size.After about 6 months the unit became \"twitchy\" where we had to torque (twist) it to get anything but garble to show up on the LCD.  We sent it in for warranty repair and got it back in about a week.  The repair process was simple enough and they have an easy method for checking the status.  Two minor complaints about the repair... 1) Our unit came back with a #4 permanently written in Sharpie on the case; it seems like they could have used tape for that instead. 2) It came back with the Korean language setting turned on and I had to dig through the manual to figure out how to set it back to English; this must be a running gag at the repair center.Bottom line is it's a nice camera for casual use, but if picture quality is important then you should really be looking into an SLR-style camera... we'll be looking into getting our Minolta repaired.", "Date": "January 8, 2009"}, {"Title": "Canon Powershot 870IS versus Panasonic Lumix TZ5", "Author": "Marc Trevino", "ReviewID": "R2BS4H2SLZD73C", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "A month before I purchased the 870IS, I purchased and returned the Panasonic Lumix TZ5 (Thanks to Amazon for easy return process).

I wanted to replace my then 6 year old Sony Cybershot DSC-P72 because I wanted a lighter and smaller camera with more optical zoom and some wide angle (my main focus). I thought that all cameras nowadays had a good flash and a good red-eye reduction, especially a brand like Canon. Little did I know!Pros: The wide angle and optical zoom are great, the camera is light and small and takes good pictures outdoors. It also takes good videos with good sound (of course it is not a camcorder!). The zoom feature does not work in video mode, though.Cons: The camera's flash is poor and the in-camera red-eye reduction is terrible. Lots of glaringly red eyes even after correcting all pictures in the camera. You can try a manual correction of the pictures that still show red eyes but most of the time the manual correction has no effect, either, and you cannot get rid of the red eyes. First of all it is a nuisance to have to correct red eyes in the camera. My now 7 year old Sony Cybershot does the correction automatically when the feature is turned on and takes much, much better indoor pictures. Like other reviewers mentioned already, the Canon SD870 IS takes very poor quality indoor pictures in settings with low light, even when using the flash. Indoors I can use the manual mode without flash when there is enough light. But in fairly dark settings I have to use the flash.

But all things considered, (PRICE!!!!! size!!!!!!) The Canon SD870IS is a pretty nice camera.  I bought this camera as a Christmas present for my partner.  She is in the real estate business and often has to take photos of houses outside and in.  The 28mm lens equivalent was the first big draw.  I looked at reviews for a handful of small point and shoot cameras with this size lens (equivalent).  I narrowed down the search to this Canon and started reading all the reviews, (not just on this site) and what I was gleaning  was that the camera was either GREAT!! or not so great because of noise at high ISO or speed of shooting.Remember this is a camera the size of a small pack of cigarettes for less that $300, read that again please......OF COURSE it is not going to be perfect, OF COURSE it will have some or a lot of noise at high ISO's, OF COURSE it is not going to have super fast shooting.......These things can be had on small point and shoots but you need to pay 5-10 times what this camera costs.  It is a very inexpensive camera, period....  What more could you possibly want from a camera this size at this price???  I remember the first digital cameras which cost close to $1000 and were so big they stored photos on old style floppy discs!!!!!Bottom line for me is you get what you pay for and what you are willing to sacrifice.

Yes, there are many instances where optical zoom is desired, BUT more often than not, WIDE-ANGLE is the way to go.I have seen some reviews decrying the lack of a viewfinder and manual exposure controls.  That's like saying a Toyota Prius lacks the power of a Corvette and the room of a Ford Expedition!No viewfinder-who cares, who uses one any longer, especially with the gorgeous 3 inch LCD.  As far as manual exposure controls, I guarantee you virtually NO ONE who purchases a camera like this cares one whit about that.  99% of the time, AUTO works fine.  There are times, such as night or low-light shooting that you may want to use one of the special modes, but otherwise, who wants to fiddle with those?

I do understand that this is an \"automatic\" camera, maybe designed for people who don't understand about aperture and shutter, but I still think it's a marketing blunder to not have such features.  I would have designed the camera for aperture and shutter priority controls with the default as all automatic.I'm also not happy about the quality of digital images.  There seems to be a \"noise\" issue with solid colors like sky.", "Date": "June 18, 2008"}, {"Title": "camera review", "Author": "T.

The background either comes out too dark (so does people in the background) or subjects come out too bright.  In addition, I have hard time getting the pictures of moving objects (especially kids) indoor and outdoor. I just want simple pictures how your naked eyes see the objects.  Canon camera is ruining the pictures by trying to accomodate for every different settings.  My 4 year old sony camera takes better pictures and I was able to capture every moments just like it is by simple point and shoot. I am soooo frustrated with Canon since I missed so many special moments. Many times, (espeically with kids) the special moments are just nano seconds long so I don't have the time to fiddle with settings, fuctions, and menus. So far with Canon, pictures came out too grainy, shadows, too dark, too bright and colors come out weird!!!  So, I need help, does anyone know ONE setting that works for every occasion and pictures come out just how you see it. I spent many hours to figure out but so far no good results  I would appreicate inputs.", "Date": "December 25, 2007"}, {"Title": "Received defective  - no sound", "Author": "S.
