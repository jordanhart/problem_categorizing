When I plugged the batteries in to recharge the charger said there was no charge and yet after charging about 15  minutes it said the batteries were charged. Again after couple of minutes of use the batteries died. I am going to get new rechargeable batteries and see if the batteries the camera came with are bad or maybe the charger is bad.", "Date": "January 1, 2013"}, {"Title": "Great Deal!!", "Author": "S.

It comes with all kinds of gadgets. It takes regular batteries which makes it easier since there isn't always time to recharge a camera battery. I lost the battery on my old camera and couldn't replace it with the same kind. I had to buy a generic one and it did not work all of the time. It was expensive to replace the camera battery so I was disappointed. I love the zoom and the clarity of the pictures!!!", "Date": "June 14, 2013"}, {"Title": "Canon Powershot SX160 IS 16.0 MP Digital Camera with 16x Wide-Angle", "Author": "machinist", "ReviewID": "R5NX0WVC3V18I", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I really lke the camera. It's fantastic but for a senior person the settings are complicated. My son is computer literate and he helped me go through that part of using the camera otherwise I would be lost. It's very well built because the case is heavy and isn't as flimsy as some new cameras. I like the wheel adjustment at the top of the camera rather than on screen touch settings on newer cameras. It's one of the last few cameras that has that adjustment. To me as an elderly person it is easier to use than going into the camera and adjusting the picture settings every time you want to take a picture when the lighting is different. The big screen on the back to view the picture is also great. The pictures come out sharp and clear because of the large amount of megapixels the camera has. I would definitely recommend this camera to others because of the previous features I spoke about.The price was very reasonable for the quality of a point and shoot camera. You will have to buy a bigger camera purse for the camera as the one that comes with it is way too small.", "Date": "February 3, 2013"}, {"Title": "Camera", "Author": "Holly O'Connell", "ReviewID": "R3A62RDCIE4M2L", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Camera works great!Pictures turn out good!Battery has not died yet either, so the life must be pretty good as well.", "Date": "February 28, 2013"}, {"Title": "canon powershot", "Author": "Sally Truax", "ReviewID": "R3FBOL0AVTPTP8", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I bought this for a Christmas gift for our daughter.
