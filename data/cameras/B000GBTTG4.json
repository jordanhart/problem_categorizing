{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Finally the right digital camera for me.", "Author": "P. Hodges", "ReviewID": "R4N4FJJ4KO0LV", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "After holding out for years before making the switch from film to digital, I finally made the leap with the DMC-L1. I have used a variety of DSLRs and digital point-and-shoot cameras prior to this. Specifically, when I was considering the DMC-L1, I was also considering the Canon 30D, and the Nikon D80 and D200 (I already had a number of Nikon lenses).After trying all of the above cameras, I was completely in love with the DMC-L1's feel and ease of use. The shutter speed dial and aperture ring are extremely intuitive to use. Overall, the camera feels much less \"fiddly\" than the other models I looked at -- I didn't like having to drill down through multiple menus on the other DSLRs to get to what I was looking for.Probably the single greatest selling point to this camera is the lens. It's one of the crispest that I've ever used. I have a Nikon 80mm F1.8 that has been my favorite for years, and the Leica lens has almost instantly supplanted it. The zoom range is pretty good for general shooting, and situations where you want to travel light [...].One of the other selling points include the simple but sensible live-view mode, which allows you to compose your shots on the camera's LCD screen. This is a huge advantage for shooting static or slow moving subjects -- you can really compose your shot, re-arrange elements, and use the depth-of-field preview to get a good sense of how everything is going to look. However, because the mirror has to flip down for the camera to focus and meter, it is too slow for most high-speed action work.The Mega OIS feature on the included lens is superb -- I've never used anything like it. There are two modes, but mode \"2\" is the only one I use -- it corrects for camera shake only when you take the picture, rather than continuously as in mode \"1\". I've taken a number of hand-held pictures at 1/4 of second or slower that would have been disasters with a non-OIS lens. Remember to turn OIS off if you are using a tripod, though.Being able to save RAW images was a selling point for me, too. This may not matter as much to others, but I like being able to edit the RAW file before \"developing\" it into an image file.Ergonomically, the camera is good. I would say that the Canon 30D is a better fit in my hand, but since I'm not going to be holding the camera for 12 hours a day it's not been a problem. I find the buttons and their locations to be sensible, and the thumb-wheel although small, works very well. My favorite elements are the two programable buttons located near the shutter release. Depending on the type of shooting I am doing, I reprogram these to my most often used functions (say EV, ISO, or film type). The film \"type\" feature is also worth noting, and may have some appeal to those that don't want to both with RAW images. There are a number of pre-programed \"films\" and two user programable \"films\" that affect the color and feel of the final images. This is a nice way to generate some decent images without going through the trouble of developing RAW images.So in summary:Cons:OK ergonomics -- people with large hands or short fingers may have difficulties.View-finder takes some getting used to. Information display is good, but it feels smaller than others I've used.This camera is not for people who want to take mostly pictures of very high-speed action. It is also not for people who want 20\" X 30\" prints (because of the lower pixel count).Pros:Very intuitive feel, particularly for converts from more traditional SLRsFantastic lensLive View image composition on camera's LCD screenMega OIS image stabilization lensMuch less fiddling than with other DSLRs -- more time shooting, less time looking through menus.RAW + JPEG file formatsGreat expansion options with the Four/Thirds lens line[...].", "Date": "November 25, 2006"}, {"Title": "Terrific DSLR for those with traditional values", "Author": "J. Boutilier \"Jim Boutilier\"", "ReviewID": "R8081U6NFDKFZ", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I've been into photography for over 30 years.  During that time I've owned quite a number of film point and shoots and SLR's.  During the last 10 years I've owned a number of point and shoot digitals, super-zooms, and now my first Digital SLR.  Manufacturers included Agfa, Canon, Casio, Contax, Leica, Nikon, Panasonic, Pentax, and Sony.During my DSLR search, I looked at Nikon D80 and D200's.  Canon Digital Rebel, EOS 30D and EOS 5D, and Pentax 100D and 10D, Sony Alpha, and of course the Panasonic DMC-L1.  My search started by pouring over specs and reviews at various sites including DPREVIEW and Steve's Digicam.  Then I took an in person look at all but the L1 at various camera stores.I can't express the level of disappointment I experienced when handling these cameras in person.  All of the sub $1000 models felt like cheap plastic junk.  Flimsy ports and doors, rough cheap feeling controls, and flexing bodies abound, Even the upscale (supposedly)  metal bodied units did not feel much better.  And all of the included kit lenses were complete trash - all plastic, horrid feeling controls, and SLOW.  Now thats not to say some of these can't take great pictures, but I just can't get past the build quality and feel.So the one camera I could not find in local stores was the Panasonic DMC-L1.  The reviews all seemed  to talk about the great build quality, the quality of the Leica lens, and pretty much panned most of the technology, ergonomics, and actual picture quality.  In desparation, I ordered one mailorder (from Amazon).While I was slightly disappointed in the build quality (feel and materials), it was heads and tails above anything else I handled.  You could actually feel the metal.  Controls were much smoother and you got the impression this was higher quality product.  Well it WAS more expensive than any of the others (except the 5D) so I guess that fits.  You just don't get much for $1999 (actually ($1600) these days.After handling and using the L1 for a couple days I find most of the things listed as Cons in the reviews were from prototypes and Panasonic seems to have corrected them in the production version.Feel is good, ergonomics are good, focus is fast, picture quality is terrific and noise is effectively controlled.  Live View works great and is much faster than I expected.  The viewfinder is definitely dimmer than a Pentax, but on par with the low end of some other big name manufacturers and its definitely not \"unusable\".  Viewfinder image size is also smaller than some of the above, but larger than others.All in all I am pleased with this product and for those with traditional values like myself where quality and feel is as important as function, this product is worth a look.", "Date": "February 9, 2007"}, {"Title": "A True 5 Star Digital S.L.R.

This is my third DSLR (Canon was very fine, Nikon also pretty fine) Shooting in RAW and using photoshop 5 Elements (as well as the included not so shaby software)produced some very impressive pictures. Just ask my family and friends. I must say that Leica optics peek through loud and clear. The pictures are very real and subject matter is so well captured and defined. Colors are very Leica typical.That being said, this is not your all purpose snapshot camera. It's a little big and heavy for that. There are lots of great little point and shoot cameras that will give this camera a run for the money. I keep one in my pocket all the time just for those quick \"Kodak Moments\" The L-1 is more of a tool for the creative artist and detail seeking photographer. (a nut like me). It allows you to go totally manual in the way of the old SLR's. It can receive all kinds of filters for landscapes and special effects. It also reverts back to all auto settings that yield very impressive results. I think that the marriage (arranged one at that) of Panasonic and Leica is excellent. Structual quality is excellent.Now I have learned that the beautiful and responsive Leica kit lens can be purchased seperately to fit other cameras that have the four thirds mount. (Olympus DSLR is a good example) But if you shop this camera carefully, you may find that this whole L-1 package comes out much cheaper. You camera nerds out there may find little faults in button placements or too little this and not enough that, etc. That's just fine. It can be said that every camera has its little faults if you look for them. That's why new models appear every time you turn around. Bottom line is the final result. To me those results thus far have been nothing short of jaw dropping. Comapared to some real megabuck Leicas and megasbyte Hassy's or whatever, it mostly all comes down to the photographer. The L-1 is a wonderful and pretty important piece of equipment. I love it and am waiting to get the new Leica 25mm f/1.4 lens to round out my camera bag and head for the mountains. By the way, get a high quality Polarizing filter and see what fabulous landscapes/seascapes you will generate on you SD cards with this L-1.

Once sensor size is standardized then lens design can be optimized.. this is what the 4/3rds format is about. Mark my words-- Nikon and Canon will have to redesign lenses and while they may be backward compatable they will be under-performers. The 4/3rds format can grow-- Sigma just signed on- how about a 3CCD imager for this format- 22 MP with same size image circle from lens.

When the shutter speed dial was set to \"A\", it would start rapidly fluxuating between the correct shutter speed as calculated from the Automatic \"A\" mode and 1/4000th of a second. This is most likely because the \"A\" is next to \"4000\" and there is a bad contact or insulator between the two contacts. This renders the camera as inoperable except for Shutter priority mode. Apeture priority and full Auto cannot be used. In addition to this main problem, the instant review feature stopped working and would only show taken images intermitently.To make matters worse, they had my camera for 3 weeks and I heard nothing from them. I called and they apologized and said that my paper work had gotten separated from the camera and that they would have it repaired immediately and I would have it back within a week. Guess what?

I thought it would be a good camera to re-familiarize myself with manual controls and a higher degree of involvement with photography. I was also in love with the design and layout of the controls and the body.I will not get into an analysis of the pros and cons of this camera; there  is enough information out there to provide anyone with a sense of how the L1 measures against the competition.  I will however, contribute a few observations.Even though the viewfinder is dark and small, you adapt to it fairly well.  I used the camera on a 4 day trip to Colorado and found it a lot better to manage than I initially thought.This camera requires patience and a willingness to try different things.  If you just stick it in Auto, you miss the whole point of using this unique instrument.  A tweak here, an adjustment there, and you are rewarded with rich, detailed and well balanced images.You will be stunned at the quality of images this camera produces.  Outdoor shots are beautifully rendered, bokeh is quite good, and the 14-50mm Leica lens is a joy to use, albeit a tad unforgiving when the wrong settings are used.7 megapixels is more than most people need.Low light performance is really poor.  The AF hunts and hunts, high ISO performance is relatively noisy (But why would anyone shoot above ISO800 anyway?) and the built in flash only works well at close range.  One cool feature is the bounce-flash feature, which returns well lit and not washed out portraits, but only at a reasonable distance.I have a Nikon D300 SLR that I use for more professional applications.  I however prefer to use the L1 as a walk around, fun camera.  It behaves very much like an analog camera.Perhaps one shouldn't think of this camera's challenges as shortcomings, but of how far digital photography has advanced and even gone beyond film in performance and flexibility.As long as lighting conditions are good, this camera shines!", "Date": "May 19, 2008"}, {"Title": "Known problem with the 14-50 Leica lens", "Author": "Tandy K. Bozeman", "ReviewID": "R1X0ODQBCDIOK5", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "This is a great camera with a stunning tack-sharp lens. That said, many owners on the Leica forum have reported a problem with the 14-50 lens that comes on the camera. The lens sometime comes with, or later develops, the problem of binding of the zoom function, which after time locks up completely or at best restricts zoom movement. Also, several new owners have reported that they have received a camera with a lens whose front end is \"loose\" and can be wiggled back and forth. This is alarming, but does not seem to effect the camera focus, at least on my DMC-L1 with its case of front end wobbles. Alas, also my lens seem to be developing the dreading zoom restriction about mid zoom.So, if you do purchase this camera, do carefully check out the 14-50mm lens for what appears to be, or have been, a widespread manufacturing defect. The lens should zoom in and out smoothly. If there is a slight restriction or a \"catch\" in the movement, you're likely in for downline trouble.With a defect-free lens, this camera is superb, and well worth the potential hassle of returning the product for replacement if you find yourself with a lens whose zoom function fails and binds.The DMC-L1 is considerably less expensive than the Leica branded version, and offers the feel and advantages of the range finder cameras like the Leica M3 or the Nikon SP, so loved by photojournalists of yesteryear.

The look and feature set just appealed to me.  Finally I got one.  It is not a perfect camera for everyone, but get your hands on one and it speaks for itself.  I love using this camera and I find it quite comfortable to use with everything where I expect it to be.  Some features I particularly like are the manual controls, two-stage flash, live view, and the kit lens.The manual controls feel more natural than using menus.  I especially like the quick access buttons on the back and the drive mode and metering switches on top.  Though these switches can change position easily at times, I still much prefer it to delving into a menu.  I also love the two programable function buttons.  This can be very useful, though be warned that one of them defaults to aperture when using a lens without the ring.  But this has its workarounds.I normally avoid using flash, but on the L1 I will try to find a way to use it.  The bounce flash I find especially useful for portraits.  The power of the flash I think is also very good for a built in unit.  Its also amusing to see other peoples' faces when you pop the flash.Live view is a feature many seem to scoff at, but I find it quite useful.  It also helps to compensate for the viewfinder's deficiencies or when you really want to get that unique perspective.And last but not least, the LEICA lens.  I wanted a bright lens, and the L1 comes with one.  Having a quality piece of glass to start with is a real plus and this lens is part of what makes the L1 the camera it is.The L1 has its faults and quirks too.The viewfinder is small and dark.  Though I don't find it to be any darker than the viewfinder on my old Canon AE-1, it is smaller than most.  But it is adequate for ordinary shooting and something you quickly adjust to.  If you're shooting detail you can use Live VIew to check focus and to better view in dark lighting.The auto focus is normally quick and near silent, but it does struggle in dim lighting or under harsh backlighting.  Then the lens racks through its range and can make a bit of noise.  But it is quieter than mechanical focus systems and I find it to be very accurate most of the time.Lastly a few nit-picks.  The flash being located off center from the lens axis can cause uneven lighting, but it is barely noticeable and often only occurs at either close or far distances.  Also, don't use the lens hood with the flash as it causes shadows.  The shutter dial is nice to use, except it doesn't turn 360 degrees.  This makes switching from aperture to shutter priority a slight pain at times.  But it isn't a big deal unless you switch between shooting modes a lot.  Battery life isn't stellar by comparison to some others, especially if you use Live View a lot.  So an extra battery would be suggested.Overall this is a very unique piece of photographic equipment and is one you will either love or hate.  But don't just take peoples' word for it.  Get your hands on one and see for yourself.  I love mine and wouldn't trade it for anything.

I don't understand people who say the picture quality is not superb because the lens is sharp as a tack. I have been shooting mostly HDR images on a tripod, the depth of field is incredible. The only things I have found lacking are the battery compartment door is flimsy, the shutter speed dial should have a lock, auto-bracketing should go to +/- 2 EV not just one and finally the RAW capture should not include JPEGS, it is a memory hog. Other than that, the controls, the fit and finish, everything about this camera is great.

What's more, the overall good build quality is ruined by a tacky piece of plastic which surrounds the controls on the back of the camera.  The LCD screen is way too small...I know this camera is from 2006, but still, it is too small.  While I like having the aperture dial on the lens, the shutter speed dial on the top of the camera is terrible.  It stops at the end of its 360 degree movement, then you have to go all the way back 360 degrees if you want to get beyond that point...this may sound like a little thing, but trust me...it is really annoying.  When dialing in exposures for HDR, I found that moving the shutter speed dial took quite a bit of pressure, making it easier to accidentally move the camera and get mis-aligned shots.  The two-phase pop up flash is a nice touch, but I didn't use it much.  I got this camera in great shape for $550.00, so I cannot complain about the price.The image quality was fine for a four thirds camera, but for the weigt, bulk, and price of this thing, you might as well get a DSLR with a larger sensor and better grip.The L1 is a decent camera, but simply not worth the ridiculous prices they were charging for it retail.", "Date": "February 1, 2011"}, {"Title": "Great camera", "Author": "JJ Loh", "ReviewID": "RR49PZE8QQKFS", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Not the most advance camera but good enough for normal photo taking.

Cons includes slower focus (comparatively), 2.5\" non swivel LCD, lack of accessories.

But after using the camera for about 10 days, and comparing it to my trusty Nikon D40x, I found it wasn't as nice as I had hoped.Unlike other DSLR's I've tried, the L1 has noise...and the noise appears in shadows at ISO 200.  The D40x has lower noise at ISO 800 than the L1 at ISO 400.Next, the L1 is not a well balance camera...I don't know if it is the shape, the lack of real grip or what. But the D40x and other DSLRs I've tried balance nicer.  That might be okay, except that while your right fingers are fiddling with shutter release and buttons on the right side, you have to use your left fingers to re-set ISO or WB...this slows down the action quite a bit.The evaluative meter on the L1 simply is not as sophisticated or as consistent at the D40x...that is one area Nikon really shines in.I do like the two position flash on the L1...works very nicely.  Live View was not as nice as I had imagined.  It's a little clumsy because the camera has to flip the mirror to focus, and flip back so you can shoot the photo.All in all the D40x took a much higher percentage of good shots.  Since I use the Function button to set ISO, I could actually set ISO faster on the D40x (by that I mean, set while maintaining a shooting position.)  On the L1, you have to fiddle a lot with the exposure compensation...setting -1/3 or -2/3 in sunlight, and + 1/3 or 2/3 on cloudy days.  In contrast the D40x gets the exposure right without having to think through every shot.All in all, the L1 is a nice enough camera...I really wanted to like it because of the direct manual controls.  But in the end, it just didn't compare with my D40x...not even close.  I suspect there are Canons, Pentax, and Olympus DSLR cameras that will also outperform it handily.", "Date": "January 5, 2008"}, {"Title": "It's Cool!", "Author": "Chang yeol Lee", "ReviewID": "RFP0673VPJT7H", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "It is impressive!
