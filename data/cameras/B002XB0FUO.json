{"Reviews": [{"Title": "A great go anywhere camera and worthy upgrade.", "Author": "Thomas E. Tweedel", "ReviewID": "R3D4XAR973VS4D", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "The Stylus Tough 6000 is the second Olympus waterproof camera I've got. I got the original 720SW, it survived quite a few adventures and continues its faithful service with a friend. I was ready for an upgrade.There were two main reasons I upgraded from the 720sw. One was the wide angle lens 28mm vs 35-38mm on it. The other was hopefully longer battery life. I found the 720sw's battery life to be anemic at best.I considered the 1030sw but decided to try out the new generation of sensor, CCD image stabilization and tap control. The Stylus Tough 8000 was also a contender but I didn't need the extra hardened casing or expense. This has the same rating as the 720SW which survived everything I threw at it and now comes in three attractive colors. I got the blue one.OverviewPulling the camera out of the box and playing with it there were several notable improvements over the previous generation. It's not quite as heavy and uses more plastics than the 720SW, more similar to the 760SW. The lens has a larger more reinforced housing probably to accommodate the wider angle.The buttons have been improved. They stick out more from the surface and have a very positive \"click\" to them. There is much more clearance with the shutter release which is nice. Your less likely to turn the thing off instead of trying to take a picture.There is the welcome addition of the control wheel. It is quick access to major features. Starting from the blue triangle (play) and going clockwise you have:iAuto - Intelligent auto, camera attempts to guess what scene mode (if any) to use or just use the automatic modes.The picture of the camera (which might be mistaken for play) is now the traditional automatic mode which oddly enough gives you more controls (like the tap control).SCN - Lets you select from a variety of scene modesBeauty Mode - Takes longer to boot up, mainly used for portraits. Requires face detection to work properly. After you take the picture the camera spends about 10 seconds processing the image applying a smoothing and contrast routine to make skin look nicer.Movie Mode is next and that brings us back to play.The other buttons are pretty standard, looks like you have three ways to access your playback now. The play setting on the dial, the play button on the back and the tap control (more later).The DISP button has been beefed up, you can now access basic shooting info (WB, FSTOP, Shutter speed), push it again and you get the histogram.The screen is vastly improved. One of the real weak points on the 7xx series was the screen wasn't sharp. You could take a great picture but couldn't tell if it was sharp or not. This was especially maddening because you really didn't know before you took the shot what your shutter speed was so you didn't know if it was just the screen or really a blurry picture. With the new screen its much better. For a bonus your shutter speed and Fstop get flashed when you do the focus lock.Tap TapSomething new is the Tap control. If not in iAuto mode you can change commands by tapping on the camera. Tapping on the left hand side brings up the macro options, macro, super macro or super lighted macro. I didn't think people did serious macro photography with sports cameras...Tapping on the side again cycles through the settings. Double tapping saves the setting you have selected.Tapping on the right lets you control the flash (auto, fill, none, redeye).Tapping on the back lets you enter play mode which is cool. You can then tap left or right to scroll through your pictures. Tap the back again to get out of play mode. Very nice.Easily accessing flash controls (to force a fill flash or cancel a flash for ambient only) and play by tapping is a excellent feature.Going DivingNot in the pool (though you could) but menu diving. Olympus has improved the menus to a degree. At the end of the day they are pretty much set up the same, they just now have pretty 3D icons and transitions between screens. On the old OLY you had the impression the processor was not current generation, now you have the impression they have CPU cycles to burn.One area that is notably different is the panorama function. It now has its own icon in the main setup. There are several new options for shooting panos to have them combined in the camera as well as a new onscreen guide. When you use the new in camera 1 feature you get a dot and crosshairs to line up to guide your picture taking. In camera 2 and in PC modes still give you the old horizon and boxes as your guide.Get your Light OnA nice feature is the inclusion of the LED flashlight. If you hold down the display button for a few seconds it kicks on a LED light about the same as keychain lights. It runs for around 20-30 seconds. Once on its not that easy to turn off, you have to hold the button a few seconds.Shooting performanceShooting performance seems to be improved. It locks onto targets faster (but still not as fast as others). The face lock is now integrated so it automatically detects and focuses for faces. Even has a smile detector where it won't fire till it gets a smile.Image quality aside from adding a few megapixels in resolution (no big deal) is improved. Images are sharper, noise is better controlled (key for small cameras). Seems to have a bit more dynamic range in the photos.It is a noticeable improvement, even in good light. So the answer of \"will this let me take better pictures than my old 7xx?\" is \"Yes\".It's got a wide variety of ISO settings and resolutions (10MP, 5MP, 3MP, 2MP). Not all ISO's and resolutions are available in each mode. The high ISO modes have reduced resolution which is fine.The CCD shift image stabilization gives you better performance than just the ISO boost. It's still not magic but it does compensate some for hand tremors.If taking the finest pictures possible with a compact camera is your goal then this probably isn't the camera for you. There are cheaper/better/faster cameras out there. Its faster than previous generations but still pretty slow in starting up, locking onto the target and refreshing after the shot. This is one of the complains people have about point and shoot cameras and this camera is no exception. My 2+ year old Fuji F-40 blows it away in all speed departments.The main reason you would buy this camera remains its toughness and versatility. If you need the go anywhere, do anything and not worry about it camera this is the one for you. I used mine biking, Kayaking, at the beach, climbing, hiking, swimming and in monsoon rains in SE Asia and its still works great. I expect this to be the same.VideoVideo performance has been improved to a good degree. The old camera often washed out in light and had a magenta cast to it. it was also limited to 15fps. Gave an old home movies quality to the video.The improved sensor on this camera gives much better video qualtiy, you also now have the option for 15fps. But there is a catch. Unless you have a type M+ XD card at full resolution (640x320) and 30fps your limited to 30 seconds of video. Anything other than full rez full motion will give you as much recording time as the card. However the compression routine they use is not as efficient as others. Compared to a Fuji I use it takes twice as much space for the same quality.AccessoriesOne area of unexpected improvement was the manual. The layout and whatnot is pretty much the same but they have separate manuals for different languages. Not an all in one.Alas when it comes to cables they have still yet to grow a brain. The video out and USB cables that plug into it have a proprietary tip on them, so don't loose it. If your smart get a card reader for file transfer. Much faster and easier on the camera.The media used still only half a brain. It primarily uses the XD format which is slow, small and expensive compared to other types. With an adapter (not included) you can use the Micro SD cards from your cell phone, if you remembered the tweezers...Why they couldn't take regular SD cards + XD Cards like Fuji can I don't know.It uses the Li-50B which is a bit thicker than the Li-42 of the previous series. Claimed battery life is at least 1/3 greater. My initial observations are that you'll get somewhere around 200 shots/charge in mixed use (some screen, some playing some flash). This is a lot better than the 7xx.So in summaryPRO'sWaterproof/Dust Proof/Freeze and shock and sand resistant.Significant User interface improvements from previous generationsTap ControlBetter screenLED flashlightBetter Image quality and stabilization than previous generationsConsImage quality/performance/speed not up to other cameras at the same price point.xD/MicroSD cards onlyproprietary cables.ConclusionMy conclusion on this one is the same as the last. If you want a decent picture taker that you can take pictures anywhere with this is an excellent choice. The years have made some good improvements that reduced the previous generations shortcomings. A worthy upgrade if you can use some of the new features and an excellent buy if your getting this type of camera for the first time.UPDATE 8-29-09The camera has survived a summer of swimming. It was constantly in the water for several hours a day, several days each week. It got dunked, dropped, scraped, stepped on and slidden over. It survived tubing trips as well as visits to Seaworld and Schliterbaun. I can add the additional observations-So far its only worse for wear in that what appears to be some type of plastic film that covers the blue part of the body has worn off at one of the corners.-Sunscreen, once on the screen glass, seems impossible to completely remove, but does it no harm.-Its been in the water up to 4 hours continuously (usually in a pocket). No leaks-The 28mm wide lens makes this much more useful. You can take pictures of others at tubing distances.-The Battery seems sufficient for a days worth of fun on a single charge.UPDATE 8-27-10The camera made another summer in the pool and at the beach, but not without issues.Keep in mind I've usually got the camera in my pocket, under water for 3-4 hours at a time.At the beach at I had another problem with microscopic grit getting into the shutter release button. This caused the button to not be able to go all the way back so when you turned the camera on it automatically cycled to half press (shutter lock) which effectively disabled the zoom. After letting the unit dry out and rinsing thoroughly with tap water this problem went away..In the pool I had two instances of flooding. The LCD started acting up and the pictures got all whacked out and in one case there was visible condensation in the lens. In both cases 24 hrs in a food dehydrator fixed the issue with no residual damage.I will be sending it into Olympus for some new seals which runs a bit less than forty bucks..", "Date": "March 6, 2009"}, {"Title": "Expensive, okay snaps and not waterproof", "Author": "24bitbob \"24bitbob\"", "ReviewID": "R3E2JDK5LWLC9W", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "The Olympus Tough 6000 is a neat little camera which offers a host of very useful features, chief amongst them being a wide angle lens (28mm equivalent) and its robust 'go anywhere' feel.  It's fairly easy to operate, though one foible I am not keen on is the on/off button which needs to be depressed a bit too long for it to do it's job - hey, mark that as a minor foible.  That's the good news.Picture quality is so-so.  If you take snaps, do a bit of basic cropping (just a little, mind) and limit your expecations of those of family viewing then the image quality is fine.  The reticience on my part on the matter of image quality is that the Olympus Tough 6000 is no better than many cameras that cost half its price.  The flash works but seems to do so with a single setting - it readily creates blown out highlights on too many photographs, the sensor produces noticeable noise, and the lag between pushing the shutter to taking the shot can be interminable.  I admit that I haven't bought a compact digital in the last couple of years and was hoping that these areas would have seen better performance.  So as a camera, i.e. a device for taking photographs, my view is that the Olympus Tough 6000 is adequate (barely) and expensive.On to the 'Tough' part.  The major selling point of this camera is its ability to suffer knocks, operate immersed in water, operate in cold temperatures, etc.  It is a rugged little device and handling it offers up a feeling of confidence.  I am just back from a two week vacation in S E Asia - we have two little kids, the eldest of whom is starting to want to take photos (my main requirement for a camera therefore is something which is kid-proof - I don't go snorkelling, haven't skied in a while nor climbed a mountain in some time, I simply want something that can withstand the rough and tumble that a 5 year old offers).  I found the camera offers a degree of robustness which should provide confidence in rough environments - that's not to say it can be handled roughly, but if you find yourself in a place where an odd knock is inevitable then the Olympus should withstand it.  However, I deliberately took the camera into a swimming pool to take some snaps (the camera does say it can operate down to 10ft water depth).  I had read the manual, and did understand that the seals needed to be checked etc etc and took all reasonable measures.  The camera worked fine under water, then half an hour later it stopped working.  Having dropped it off at the local repair centre, the prognosis is that the camera has water in it - if they can't fix  it I'll get a new one, and I'll know that in a couple of weeks.  Given the warnings I saw splashed on the walls of the repair centre, the advice displayed on the Olympus web site and the advice in the Tough 6000 User Manual, I'd guess there is a degree of concern about its watertightmess.  In fact my view is that this feature needs to be reconsidered - I took all precautions mentioned in the manuals did the checks immediately prior to taking the camera into the pool and still had problems.  By the way, I was in a 3ft deep pool and took the camera dowm to about half depth - lets say 18\".  So in my view the Olympus Tough 6000 is probably tough, but probably not waterproof.In summary this camera could be a good buy if you need something robust which can take a few knocks and offer up reasonable snaps.  I would take it up a mountain, but would not recommend going sub-surface at all. I believe it is pricey for what it does, but value is a personal decision.", "Date": "April 15, 2009"}, {"Title": "More like Olympus unTough", "Author": "Locke D. \"soulfilament\"", "ReviewID": "R3UXGMTLL26EKI", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "My wife and I bought this camera for underwater photography at the beach.  Within one month of purchase we used it on two separate outings, in both cases it was submerged less than 3-feet under water.  During the second outing, the camera locked up and failed.During the first outing, I realized a stupid design mistake on the camera: there is an automatic retracting lens cover (a sliver of stainless steel) on the outside of the lens.  While this does protect the lens, it also traps any moisture accumulated on the lens, requiring frequent cleaning with shirts or whatever might be available (I don't usually go out on the beach with a lenspen or microfiber).  The worrisome part of this design, is that if there is enough room for a sliver of metal to move back and forth, then there is enough room for water and moisture to get inside.During our second outing, after five minutes we noticed big white spots had occurred on the LCD screen which I can only assume means water damage.  A few seconds later the camera locked up.  I dried off the outside with my towel, popped open the battery compartment, and there was water inside.  I pulled out the battery, let the camera dry out, put back in the battery, no dice - still dead.I am now sending the camera back for service, but I am not hopeful as I have heard reports that Olympus does not honor the warranty on these cameras and will charge around $175 to repair them.  This is only what I have read, and will report my experience as it returns.I do wish I had paid more attention to the reviews before buying, and perhaps bought the more revered Pentax.  The camera takes dismal regular photos, so it's only appeal for me was the waterproof/rugged component.  It's a real shame that mine hasn't worked as advertised.Take my experience for what its worth.", "Date": "June 14, 2009"}, {"Title": "Stopped working after 3 weeks , no support from Olympus", "Author": "Aldo Di Luca \"Ad\"", "ReviewID": "R32QF2FVK9PZS7", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "After 3 weeks or so of using this camera,  I got an error message stating \"Card Cover Open\" after opening and closing the card cover several times , the error kept showing up and the whole camera was locked up. I went on line and found out that this is a common error in this camera. I tried some of the solutions posted on line but non will work. (By the way , this error prevents you from operating the camera). Once I gave up , I went to Olympus web site which is useless , I also emailed inquiring about the error and got no reply. the only info I could find regarding this was that the basic repair cost would be of over $140.To sum up:1-Camera looks good but will stop working just because it thinks the card  cover is open2-Olympus lacks decent customer care ( they were not even kind enough to send an auto confirmation receipt of the e mail sent to them)3- Basic repair cost , costs almost as much a decent pentax underwater cam.If you are willing to give this camera a shot just because the the amazing features and looks , make sure you are willing to strugle with Olympus web site and customer care.By the way.... I was about to buy the Olympus DSLR E620 amazing picture quality and features that beat all competitors at that price range , fortunatly my stylus tough 6000 died before I made the purchase which warned me about the huge mistake purchasing Olympus products is. Obviously I cancelled the order and will now gto either with canon or pentax for both under water and DSLR cameras.****Update ***I finally got an answer from Olympus cutomer care.... They provided instructions to submitt the camera for repair, I was surprised cause the turn around time was within a couple of days and the repair was covered by the warranty. Olympus still makes it hard to contact them , but at least once you finally get through they honor their warranty and return the product pretty fast.", "Date": "March 2, 2010"}, {"Title": "Good Idea - Poor Execution", "Author": "A Georgis", "ReviewID": "R3CDVCB4K1TOI0", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I had really high hopes for this camera and have always been a fan of Olympus products going as far back as the Pen, XA and 35mm Stylus film cameras. I've used a couple of their digital point and shoot cameras in the past and thought they performed well. This particular camera is a big let down though.The good. For me it did fine in water and I took it into the Pacific Ocean on a surfboard. It got beat up pretty good. I also used it underwater with no problem. The wide lens is extremely useful underwater due to the magnification factor. The images are generally nice, sharp and clear with good contrast. Good macro mode (including an LED light mode).The BAD (and there really is a lot to list here). Let's start out with the worst. This camera is one of the slowest functioning digital camera I've ever owned. Slow to focus. Slow to start up. Slow to shoot. The control buttons and dial are easy to bump and way to close together which is especially bad if you're doing something active (rafting or whatever). Even on stable, dry land this is a problem. Don't even get me started on Tap Control - it's the worst idea ever. The battery is tiny and battery life is awful. Menus are too deep and there are just too many options on this camera except for the one option I would have liked (aperture priority shooting)So my recommendation is avoid this one. The small form factor and waterproof/underwater combination is just too good to be true. IMO this camera fails by trying to do too many things and not doing any of them well. Sorry Olympus... no hard feelings. I'm getting an Olympus E-P1 Pen - so hopefully that one can renew my faith.", "Date": "July 31, 2009"}, {"Title": "love the versitility of the camera", "Author": "Kula", "ReviewID": "R6KOE6BZ574DN", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This camera is awesome. I mainly got it because I want to have a nice camera that I don't have to be extra careful with. I work with kids and take a lot of pictures, and they inevitably want to use my camera to take pictures and I usually let them, but I tend to hover to make sure it doesn't get accidently dropped in the sandbox or in a tub of water. Now, I'm happy that I won't have to worry about this anymore. This camera can withstand a 5 foot drop onto concrete or into water.I don't have much use for the tap feature, which is designed to be used with gloves, because I live in southern California. It's more annoying to have it activated when you don't need it but I'm sure it's a great feature for when you are bundled up and you don't want to take your gloves off.I really like the portrait modes the stylus has because it makes it east to quickly switch to different modes. The screen helps you switch to different modes too, it is pretty bright and it is a lot easier to see in daylight than previous cameras I have owned.I have yet to really take it on an underwater excursion, but I have tested it out in the sink a few times and in the bath and there was not any water seepage into the battery compartment or in the USB port.I love the ability to do in-camera fixes with red eye and lighting. The camera also automatically saves the edited picture separate from the old, so you don't have to worry about it replacing the original picture, if you don't like the new effect.I love the fact that this camera has a built in memory. You can only a take a few pictures with it, but you don't get that \"No memory card\" error anymore. It's a good feature to have in a pinch, especially when you first get it to test out the features. The camera also tells you in the corner how many pictures you have left and how many minutes of video you have left on the card or in the internal memory. No more snapping away pictures only to hear the beep! beep! and see the \"memory full\" words pop up on the screen; then there's the scramble to quickly delete pictures. You'll never have to guess how many shots you have left.I've only had the camera a few days and I haven't tried out all of the features, and I am looking forward to that and I will update my review. I have yet to use the in camera panorama feature, I am pretty sure that you have to have an Olympus card in order for this to work and I am using the micro SD card adapter and using a 2 MP card.The program that comes with the camera is also pretty good and user friendly. It has the same feel as Google's Picasa, but I haven't played with it much yet because I really like Picasa!There are a couple of things I don't really like about the camera. One is I wish there were more features for the video camera, it pretty much has an option of 15 fps and 30 fps. My older camera has about 10 different video options. Two, is that I don't think picture quality is as great as a Canon with the same number of mega pixels. The picture comes out looking a little more digital and not as crisp. But I will gladly give up a little picture quality for a camera that comes with all of the underwater, freeze proof, etc features.So, I think this camera is definitely worth the price, and if I had $100 more to spend I would have definitely gotten the 8000. I love its versatility with being a real outdoorsy camera, and I would recommend it to anyone who wants a high end digital camera that can withstand some drops and some water.", "Date": "February 7, 2009"}, {"Title": "Loved this camera for 3 years till it broke.", "Author": "Monica Stapley \"MonicaS\"", "ReviewID": "R1CQ525RASL6L6", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Update May 2012 (almost 3 years after purchase)Well, I went on my 2nd cruise this time to the Eastern Caribbean. I tested out my Olympus at home first because it had been quite awhile since I'd had it under water. Everything seemed fine. I used the camera for the first few days of the trip. At our first port in St. Thomas, I used the camera snorkeling at Coki Beach and at Sapphire Beach and got some AMAZING video of swimming with a sea turtle! The following port day, at Tortola, I had the camera out snorkeling at Turner's beach. It seemed to be working fine, I would turn the power off and on as I wanted to snap photos. But in the middle of the day when I tried to power it on, it came up with a red error message indicating that there was debris in the card reader area or one of the seals wasn't sealed. I never opened any of the compartments except when back in our room, so I don't think human error caused the issue. Maybe it got some sand in the lens area while I was putting my flippers on in the shallow surf. It never did work after that and after a few hours wouldn't even power up to give me the error message (although both batteries I tried showed a green full charge on the charger). I've tried and tried to dry it and blow things out to no avail. But I really loved this camera up until it broke. Would I buy another?... not sure yet. I'm going to read the reviews on the competitors cameras before replacing it.Original ReviewI purchased this camera from [...]right before my 10 day western caribbean cruise this July 2009. I took it snorkeling in the ocean about 3 times (grand cayman, cozumel, and roatan honduras, on our rugged mayan cave tubing adventure in Belize, dropped it, got caught in rain/downpours with it, its been packed, poked, prodded and still continues to take GORGEOUS photos. Take the time to read the manual and learn what all the settings are for. I've found that indoors, the \"candle light\" setting often works very well. Sometimes the flash can blow out the background, but the candle light setting ensures you get all the detail and that its not grainy. I use the \"action\" and macro settings together all the time to take awesome pictures of my cats and dogs at home. The detail is amazing. I also used the \"action\" setting to take photos out of tour bus windows on our trip. Even though we were whizzing by the scenery, I was still able to capture it through the window. The panoramic function is really fun to play with too and you can get some really amazing pictures from this. I've never had any problems with the waterproof functionality of this camera. Just be sure you let it dry out appropriately before opening any compartments. I also think the battery life is great. I never had it die on me on our trip and I used it ALL DAY. I would only charge it at night. It would be nice if Olympus would include a lens cleaning cloth so you can dry the lens off after underwater usage. I used a fossil sunglasses cleaning cloth and it worked great on the lens and on the view screen. I also purchased a SONY brand soft case for the camera. It fits perfectly to protect the screen from scratching and wasn't bulky. I used a neck-strap tether with a caribeaner hook to carry it around on my trip for quick access and so it wouldn't get stolen. I also used a wrist velcro strap when I was snorkeling/swimming with it. That way I could let go and never worry about it sinking. I bought a 2nd memory card but didn't really need to. It was nice to switch cards halfway through the trip though and feel good knowing that at least half my photos were safe just in case the camera did get stolen or lost somewhere along the way. I wish I could figure out how to upload some sample photos to show you how great this camera is. I think I'll try to video some of the photos and come back and post them here later.", "Date": "September 14, 2009"}, {"Title": "Slow, slow and slow...and proprietary", "Author": "Ran Borgersen", "ReviewID": "R2K2Q0N9DHKI2O", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "This is a great idea with frustrating implementation.Positives:- I found it to be durable and waterproof- You can have some controls activated by tapping the camera on the side--cool!- Takes okay pics (weak positive)Negatives - Slow.

Millikan \"Active Dad\"", "ReviewID": "RS3UCA8QZ3YOK", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "We really like the camera thus the 5 stars.  We have 3 kids under age of 8 and took the Olympus Stylus Tough 6000 to Hawaii for 2 weeks, backpacking for a week and Disneyland for a day. I also shoot a SLR Nikon D80 digital and my Nikon N90s film camera is collecting dust.--== Raves ==--1. Very durable.2. Automatic metal lens cover so lens doesn't get scratched when bouncing in backpack/purse.3. Thought for sure it would die after rolling around all day in my board shorts pocket in the sandy beach shore pound. Came out fine.4. Easy one handed operation.5. 28mm lens means taking a self portrait at arms-length works great.6. Underwater shots and movies look pretty darn good.  I was impressed.  The review at DP Review says underwater performance is so-so.7. Autofocus at low light is much better than I've experienced in other point-n-shoot cameras however DP Review says it's only so-so.8. The underwater movies have sound!  You can hear the bubbles ;-)9. Warm colors in images are great.10. Waterproof coating on the lens works fine.--== Gripes ==--1. It is slow to turn on.2. When I set it to \"manual fill flash\" (needed to get rid of the dark shadows the kids faces when they have their hats on during sunny days) it only remembers my manual change until I turn it off.  When I turn it back on, I have to set the auto fill flash again.3. Olympus uses the xD memory card format.  The card size kinda maxes out at 2 gigs (that's all that's available for sale although tech specs say it can go higher) which is fine since the cam doesn't shoot HD video.  Some of the other waterproof cameras shoot HD video which would eat up memory really fast but they take the normal miniSD or whatever.  My 2 gig card holds like 16 min of standard def video or alternatively it can hold like 300 images.4. The \"tap control\" turns itself on every once and a while.  Just have to go in and turn it off.  No biggie, but distracting.5. Battery life is better than I expected but wish it was longer.  Does about a 2 days of busy picture taking before needing recharge.  I'm purchasing backup battery this week (looks like OEM battery is like $5 here on Amazon).6. Cannot zoom the lens in movie mode.Were I to buy it again, I would also consider the Pentax Optio W80 and the Panasonic Lumix DMC-TS1 since reviews say picture quality is better and they shoot HD video.  I would not consider the Canon because the review says it doesn't easily fit into a pocket. Again, I'm very happy with this Olympus and no matter what, if you've got small kids, getting a drop proof, crush proof, water proof camera is a great thing if the budget allows.[...]", "Date": "August 27, 2009"}, {"Title": "Garbage!!!!", "Author": "D.

I still love that it's tough and waterproof, but when I want to take a picture ... look, the whole point of a small, portable, go absolutely anywhere camera is that you want to be able to pull it out and snap a picture whenever you want - and chances are, if you're looking for waterproof, it's because you are going to use it doing sports, and sports happen FAST, right? So you don't want to:A) Try to turn the camera on, and fail, because you didn't press the \"on\" button for quite long enoughB) Watch the stupid 1.5 second advertisement for their annoying new \"touch\" feature, which you don't care about anywayC) Press the photo button and wait for 2 seconds while the screen goes first dim, then black, then finally takes the picture.By then, your friend Bill has completely washed off the wave he was surfing, skied by you, hang-glided into a 747, or whatever, and you've totally missed the moment. Honestly, their last model (which was cheaper and supposedly a generation poorer than this one) was SOOO much better at being fast. I don't even care that this one has 3 extra megapixels.

Given that one of the camera's features is that it is \"dust proof,\" I thought it would be a good buy.  Although the camera is more durable than other models, I would not call it \"dust proof\" as much as \"dust resistant.\"  Two months into the deployment I began having trouble with the lens cover not fully retracting.  After three months, it stopped retracting completely.  As I couldn't send the camera in for repairs (no postal system to mail it) I decided to risk further damage by taking apart the camera.  When I opened it up I found dust covering the inside, along with a layer of corrosion.  I managed to temporarily fix the camera; but a day later the problem returned.  I ended up having to order a new camera--which I'm still waiting on.  The Stylus Tough 6000 takes good pictures, but there is a long delay from when you push the button to when the photo is taken.  During photo ops I always had complaints about that.  I would recommend this product (in fact, the camera that I ordered is the upgraded version); however, I would recommend proper care for the camera, as it isn't as durable as the manufactorers would claim.  Since most places aren't as dusty as Afghanistan, I would say that the only inconvient feature is the delay when you're taking pictures.  For those troops who are deploying, don't carry the thing around in your cargo pocket like I did. I thought the microfiber pouch I kept it in would protect it, but it didn't.

I wanted something small, rugged and waterproof for the many days we were to spend on the Salmon river in Idaho. I also wanted a camera that could be used easily (auto) when I was engaged in another activity, but had some manual features for times when I could take the time to try different settings and controls. It passed the waterproof test on day 2 when I was dumped from my inflatable kayak with the camera in my shirt pocket. After a 6-7 minute float/swim, I was pulled into the chase raft. I dried it off, and it worked right away. During the rest of the week, the camera and I were submerged one other time and soaked often by the river and the rain -- and the camera continued to work perfectly.Since that first trip, I have used my Stylus Tough-6000 in the rain/water on various canoe/kayak trips, in the dust and heat of Egypt and Jordan, and for a wide range of hiking and biking adventures in Italy. It has not failed under any of these conditions. I must say, I do try to keep the lens, LCD display, battery compartment, and sliding lens cover as clean as possible. I also make sure to dry it well as soon as I can safely open it (away from the elements). My one \"toughness\" complaint is with the LCD screen. In addition to the inevitable scratches, it has also become a bit \"cloudy.\" I'm not sure what has caused this, but it seems to be getting slightly worse with age. I regret not using screen protectors from the beginning, and hope I can stop the deterioration with some TLC and protective film. Anyone have any suggestions?I find the Stylus Tough-6000 generally easy and fun to use. I most often use the iAUTO and \"optimum aperture and shutter speed\" (the little camera icon) settings. In the latter mode, you can select flash modes (or turn flash off) and change exposure compensation (among a few other things). I find this helpful for creating effects or shooting in lower light settings where flash is not allowed (or might be too harsh for the background). I have used a few of the \"scenes\" settings (e.g., candle, sunset, fireworks) with mixed results. I find I get more what I want by adjusting a few settings with \"optimum aperture and shutter speed.\" I think the \"candle\" and \"beach/snow\" settings, in particular, don't reproduce what one would expect. As others have noted, it can take longer than you would want to capture pictures in certain light conditions. I use the 2GB XD cards, so this might improve with faster memory. At any rate, I do lose shots due to the slow focus and image capture, and wish it were a little better in this regard.The image quality is better than I expected. I had pretty low expectations for a point-and-shoot, and was pleasantly surprised when I downloaded the pictures after my first trip. I almost always use the \"fine\" setting (about 10MB/picture) and was able to produce 4x6 and 5x7 prints that looked pretty darned good. One of my traveling companions commented favorably on the quality of my photos from both Idaho and Egypt compared to his, which were taken with an older Canon DSLR. I have to admit, he wasn't just being kind -- the pictures were clear, sharp and with few examples of noise at higher shutter speeds. At slower shutter speeds, there was more noise, but the pictures (even in very low light) were surprisingly clear. (FYI -- I always use the \"image stabilizer\" setting). For a point-and-shoot, I am very impressed!All in all, I am very pleased I got this camera. I feel it delivered what was promised, and more.

Hurtack", "ReviewID": "R3GCZVNGXA8DWW", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I've had this camera about a year now, and use it about once a week.  I tend to go up to the Rocky mountains either for mountain biking, hiking, or snowshoeing.  I bought this camera because I wanted something that could handle the temperature ranges, could survive a drop, and was compact enough to easily stick in a pocket while still taking great pictures.  The water proof issue wasn't important at all to me.  The different modes for taking photos was important - especially the snow/beach mode.Overall, I like this camera a lot.  The picture quality is fantastic, and it is simple to use.  Compared to my old camera it is easier to access modes like Macro or self timer which is important to me.  The various modes are definetly a plus, especially the snow/beach mode when I'm up in the mountains snowshoeing.I was a bit surprised by the wide angle lens, and often found myself accidently getting a finger in the shot at first, but soon learned not to do so and I now appreciate some of the great shots I can get now with a much wider lense.  The two zoom modes are sufficent.The larger screen is great at giving a better view which helps setting up shots, especially of wild life.I have accidently dropped this camera a few times and set it in the snow and it has not flinched.  Although I don't purposely toss this camera around it's nice to know it won't 'die' if it does get dropped or subjected to subfreezing temps.The battery life is impressive too.The various modes for taking photos and things like shadow adjust are great, and for those who like to tweak the exposure it is possible to manually do this with this camera.  The iAuto is a great mode for those who just want a straight forward point and shoot camera.In the winter I tend to wear gauntlet style gloves and I am still able to operate this camera's buttons.  The tap control is handy, but I've noticed I can accidently trigger a button via the tap mode by putting the camera into a pocket and accidently bumping a side of the camera.The power save mode is nice, the screen shuts off after a few seconds, but I wish it had a longer delay.  Sometimes it goes off too soon when you're trying to shoot.  A minor issue.  I'd also like to be able to save my settings for the zoom, shadow adjust etc. so if I turn the camera off the next time I don't have to reset it.Overall, this is a great camera that takes great photos.

Ultimately, I purchased this camera, a 8GB Micro chip, float strap, and extra battery through amazon.Pros:You have the freedom to take the camera with you to the beach and into the water so there is no need to worry about it \"walking away\".I dropped it on day three in a parking garage.  The case doesn't look new, but it had no effect on the picture quality or response.The video is nice above or below the water.  Sound works below the water also.The pictures turned out nice.The interior pictures were great without using a flash.The extra weight feels better if you are use to a larger camera.The lense has a cover (somthing the other under water cameras I tested did not have)The wide angle lense is great for getting more in.The beauty feature is fun to play with... less wrinkles.I was able to use the one battery for the entire day, so there was no need to open up the camera for charging.My four year old could operate the camera easily.  He liked the wide angle because he could take pictures of him self, even with short arms.The dual image stabilization is a must! It was easier to get a clean shot compared to other cameras without this feature.Seemed to work great in the hot tub also, I was a little scared about that one, but in high humidity areas it worked great too.Con:The delay in taking the pictures was a pain if you wanted a quick shot, but you get use to it. I used the sport action setting for pictures from the moving car.  That worked to speed it up.Zoom is not as good as it could be.The flash is too bright when close (I have not read anything in the book to see if this can be dialed down, so don't use it if you are close to the subject.The control wheel is small and I worried that it was not hitting the notch on the specific setting.  I never tried the tap camera feature.  That might help when in the water.You can't figure everthing out by just reading the screen.  I had to break out the book to get more detail about what some settings wereWhen I dropped it in the parking garage the area around the lense was chipped and looked like a cheap plastic covered in a metal foil.I never found a real good way to dry between the lense and sliding cover.A few more notes.I was careful to make sure that nothing was in the way of the seal on the access doors so the digital camera was water proof.  I could see the seal having a problem, if this step was omitted.  I rinsed the camera off after being in the sand and salt water, which made a difference. I was constantly wiping off the lense which helped to get clearer pictures.  The float strap is a must if you are getting wet.  I used it shelling.  All the digital cameras I looked at sunk to the bottom when dropped including this one without the strap.  The float strap was nice when I wanted to simply drop the camera in the water to free up my hands... or when I un intentionally dropped it in the Gulf of Mexico.  Buying a large capacity chip helps a lot because you would not want to open the camera to change the chip when you are sitting on a beach or in the water.  You need the camera to be as dry as possible before opening the access doors.Fun camera to play with...

This rep then convinced us to buy the same camera (we did think about it for a while before making an impulse buy) because hey, if it can withstand fighting conditions in Afghanistan, surely it could survive our suburban lifestyle, right?  WRONG.  In July, after VERY LITTLE water use (hey, we live in Boston...how much beach time do we really see?), our camera just didn't turn on.  Upon inspection, the battery compartment looked corroded, so I made a special trip to a UPS store and spent $15 to ship it back to diagnose---oh, and this is after waiting hours for the supposedly easy, user-friendly email paperwork that you fill out online & are supposed to then get an email to print out & include in your shipment.  Yeah, 3 weeks later & I still never got that email (and no, it's NOT in my spam.)  I was supposed to get a response from Olympus once they received the camera within 24 hours.  3 days later, no response, so I finally just called and spoke to \"Stacy\" (who, by the way, was the only person who answered the phone every time I called...I was trying, after call #1, to get a more polite rep on the phone.)  She proceeded to tell me that my camera needed major repairs & I would owe $125 to fix it.  Are you kidding me?  For that, I could have 2 or 3 new, more reliable digital cameras from a better company!  So I explained why I felt it wasn't right that they were charging me for a camera that was literally called \"TOUGH\" & was supposed to withstand virtually anything (much more than being dropped a few times by us or taking some pics on vacation while underwater in the pool or ocean).  Rather than abiding by the old theory that the customer is always right, she blamed US for not washing it after each water use (which was wrong, because my husband informed me that he followed the directions to a \"T\" and washed it after each use thoroughly) and told me that we should have read the manual.  She had no sympathy whatsoever and even when I suggested that I wanted to talk to a manager, she blew me off.  My only options were to fix it or have it sent back & A) be out of a camera that I spent at least $300 only 22 months ago and B) eat the $15 I spent to ship it.  So I told her to just send it back.  Needless to say, I will NEVER buy another Olympus product again as they do not stand behind their products and I will be sure to share my experiences with Olympus with everyone I know.", "Date": "August 29, 2012"}, {"Title": "Get it wet and you own a paper weight", "Author": "Matthew B.

I never once had any issues with this camera until I took it to the OBX and brought it in the ocean. I was in about waist deep water with large waves crashing on the camera and myself--sure enough when I got out of the ocean the camera had white spots all over the screen and would no longer work. I attributed this malfunction to the years of abuse this camera had been through and thought nothing of it. So when this one died I upgraded to the Stylus Tough 6000---COMPLETE DISAPPOINTMENT. I took care of this camera and took all proper precautions that I had not taken with my previous camera. Not even a year after getting the camera I went on a float down the James River and maybe had it submerged in waist deep water for 10 minutes. Now the camera says \"Card cover open\" and will not move past this screen. There was also extensive water damage to the inside of the camera that was apparent to anyone who looked at the lens.

I do not recommend this camera for underwater use.After talking with Olympus customer service, I will never buy another Olympus product again. WHen I told them of my experience, they said that the seals on the camera need to be replaced once a year in order to ensure waterproofing. But where does it say that? On page 65 in tiny print. I told them that that seemed like rather an important point and why wasn't it more prominently displayed?

LISTEN UP! I didn't. This camera is irrevocably and fatally flawed by its tortuously slow shutter lag. In bright light it occasionally works OK and takes fairly decent pictures. But, in low light settings the lag time is up to 8 SECONDS! EIGHT SECONDS!! (That's called the 'self-timer' feature on any other camera!) Heck, I was trying to photograph my granddaughter playing on the beach in Hawaii in broad daylight and it missed every single shot! How Olympus EVER had the gall to release this into the market place is beyond me. The camera does all kinds of other nifty but worthless tricks, but the shutter lag makes it virtually USELESS as a camera. This is not a camera; it's a sophisticated and expensive waste of natural resources. And a complete waste of time and energy.

I bought this camera after doing a lot of research, and knowing what the reviews were.The picture quality with this camera is beautiful. Some are saying that the photos are grainy, and yes, they are when you use it on out of the box settings. It happened to me and I was very discouraged, but I played around with it, and now the quality is amazing! I set my image quality compression on 'fine', and that solved the problem.The camera comes with specific instructions on underwater usage. I have not tried it yet, but the instructions are very simple and easy to remember. The key is to keep the lens clean at all times, and to thoroughly clean the camera and lens after outings. This can be done by running the lens, open, under a stream of water, and submerging the entire camera for about 10 minutes. If you clean the lens without water, only use a lint free cloth, or lens pen.Since this camera is freeze proof (to 14F), I took it out on a lake with me today and took a lot of pictures. I gave the camera a good workout, and it did a great job. It didn't freeze up or stall at all. The temperature outside was around 25F. I also took a picture of a fish that was swimming by a FishTV underwater camera, and the Olympus captured the fish perfectly.The package included with the camera has the Olympus Master 2, which is the editing program for your pictures. This program has a ton of different things you can do to your photos. I had a Kodak before this, and it's editing program was no where near as large as the Master 2.Yes, this camera does have slow shutter speed. That bothered me at first, but after seeing what this camera can really do, I'll take the slow shutter speed. It does take about 4 seconds after pressing the button to take the photo.All in all, I definitely recommend this camera.

If an inside shot comes out a bit too dark, it can easily be touched up with the Olympus Master software.Regarding the review that said it doesn't take good shots of anything that isn't still.  I've had SOME problem with this - but sometimes putting the camera on the sports setting fixes this (unless there's too much fast motion).Regarding the review that said night scenes come out blurry...  Yes, they do, if you don't put the camera on a tripod or hold it perfectly still on a hard surface.  I've gotten a few SPECTACULAR night shots when I've been able to rest the camera on something to hold it still!  (One of those shots was even a purposely blurred motion one for a lighted ride at an amusement park.  The blurred light effect came out just like I wanted, and everything else around it came out perfectly clear.)Regarding the reviews that say it takes about 3 seconds for it to snap a picture once you press the shutter button...that's an exaggeration.  I timed it, and it's definitely less than 3 seconds.  It does take longer than I'd like to focus in some situations, though.Regarding the review that said it locked up on her 3-7 times a day when out snorkeling.  I've had this happen to me only a couple times since buying the camera almost 3 years ago.  (I've had to pop the battery out & pop it back in to get it working again.)  I think this is a very minor con, considering how long I've had this camera.Regarding the reviews that say the picture quality is poor & the photos come out grainy....  I don't know if maybe they're not using the camera on the right settings for the situations, because the only time I have this problem is when I'm taking pictures at an indoor show with only the stage lighting & a lot of movement on the stage.  (I think I may have finally found something that works for that though - will be able to test my theory in June.)  Other than that, I find the picture quality to be awesome!!  If I'm not quite happy with the tone or contrast, this can easily be fixed with the Olympus Master software.I can't comment on the reviews regarding the camera not working after using it in water, because I don't take any underwater photos.My only complaints about the camera are the slow start-up time when you turn it on, and not being able to zoom when recording a video.  I feel these are very minor complaints, considering how happy I am with the camera overall.

I strongly recommend the Panasonic Lumix DMC series over this.1) This camera takes almost *6* seconds to turn all the way on and be ready. Good luck with impromptu or action shots.2) This camera takes almost 2 seconds to take a picture and then return to ready.3) The user interface is absolutely horrible. On the back there is a \"D-pad\" which has left-right-up-down-ok. The don't seem to understand how it might be useful. In ready mode, clicking the up arrow hides the menu. Clicking it again undoes this. Clicking the left arrow brings up the menu. Clicking on it again does not undo this. Clicking the right arrow also brings up the menu as does clicking down arrow, the OK button and a dedicated \"menu\" button (in case you missed mashing one of the other 4). None of these take you to the start up menu, but rather to an awkward choose-a-shot-mode menu.4) The choose-a-shot-menu is off-by-one. You are actually adjusting the settings for the menu item to the left of the one in the column of settings (that is you are turning on/off flash for the menu over to the left by one). Huh?5) Don't worry though, until you find out how to get to the camera set up menu (none of the 6 hardware menue related buttons do this), it won't save your settings. You have to find this secret Easter-egg \"Save Settings\" option which defaults to OFF, and turn it on or you will lose your settings when you power off.  wow. That's what I want.6) It takes no less than 4 clicks to toggle flash on and off. In fact, every operation is buried under a bevy of clicks.7) The door that seals the battery and your flash card is difficult to open and close, making it easy to leave open and destroy the hardened aspect of this camera.8) Just the opposite, the power button is very easy to hit. So your camera will turn on and take pictures in your carrying case and pocket until the battery runs out.9) Image quality is poor in anything other than bright daylight. The harsh flash washes out the image. The flash comes on a lot where my other cameras don't need it.10) The casing is made of plastic (you can squeeze it to feel it bend) and feels very disposable plasticy.  Plastic is hard (luggage cases are made of this), but it feels cheap, rounding out the cheap feeling experience.I recommend the Panasonic Lumix DMC which has a slow power on too, but feels solid and takes great pictures and has a much better interface.", "Date": "October 10, 2010"}, {"Title": "terrible camera in most lighting situations", "Author": "Ken B", "ReviewID": "R3QVN710GFHMEI", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I've had this camera for over a year. I've taken maybe 60 photos with it even though I'm an avid photographer. The picture quality is so bad I rarely bring it out. This camera will take good pictures in bright sunlight outdoors ONLY! I had to use it to take a picture of a hand yesterday and the flash kept coming on in iAUTO mode. Of the 3 pictures, 1 was blown out by the flash, 1 was out of focus, the the third was mediocre with poor detail. Most of the shots I've taken with it under less than ideal lighting (outdoors and bright sun) have come out inferior. All indoor shots are inferior. The software just isn't working here. It needs a lot more tuning, but Olympus has never updated the firmware.Another thing that's happened a lot is that the camera will randomly switch from using the data card to using the internal memory. So after a few shots it's full and I have to pull the card out and reinsert it to get it working again. I am using a 4GB Transcend microSD card with the XD card adapter supplied with the camera. I'm looking into buying a 2GB XD card now to see if that will fix the issue. I couldn't find any XD cards larger than 2GB. Very odd since I have a 16GB SD card in my other camera.The reason I got this camera in the first place was because I've drowned 2 others in the river fishing. So for showing that humongous fish you've caught, in which case capturing you and the fish is more important than the actual picture quality, this camera will suffice. It won't short out in the water and won't die when you drop it. But if you want pictures to print or post on Flickr, this is not it. My other camera is a Lumix LX3, my pride and joy.

I was unsure of the picture quality as I have had no experience with the Olympus camera.  I was pleasantly surprised by the results.It has a number of automatic scene modes which I use quite a bit and the result has been fantastic pictures.  Couple notes, just like with any point and shoot camera the flash is not going to fill a room so trying to shoot subjects further than 10 feet in a dim room will not net the desired result, but if you keep the subjects under 10 feet you get the light you want and great results.  Outdoor pictures are very good but this will not be the camera for shooting action sports.  Just not fast enough. Also I notice the zoom is a little slower than the zoom on the canon.

I have not had a chance to use it as I am off to Bermuda next week. When I return I will let you know how well this camera preformed. if it preforms as well as Electro brands then it will be a hit. They not only provide great deals but when a situation arises they are right on it (needed it shipped as quickly as possible). Which they graciously did for me. They will answer any emails as quickly as possible so you are not waiting for an answer. I just happen to be the Customer Service Manager for a very large telecommunications company so I realize how difficult customer can be BUT Electro brands is very accomodating and helpful with FAST, PROMPT, SERVICE.If anyone needs electronics do not hesitate to buy from them.....", "Date": "August 3, 2011"}, {"Title": "Olympus Stylus 6000", "Author": "J.
