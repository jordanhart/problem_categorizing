This is my first digital camera. I wasn't going to buy one until I thought they approached SLR quality.For the most part this camera takes better pictures than my Canon AE program.The features are great.  You can keep total control of every feature or let the camera do it for you.Particularly nice is the nightframing shot which lets you set up your shot in infrared and then flash it in normal light.The hologram mode which paints your subject in a laser graph before shooting to control focus and flash also works flawlessly.I was worried about picture quality, but at 5 megapixels features remain crisp and clear even when blown up by several degrees.I'd read online about some color saturation isues, but I've experienced none whatsoever.  On full automatic mode the Sony engineers seemed to have programmed the camera to create a true to life portrait.  A lot of photophiles like higher saturation, and you can get whatever degree of color saturation, crispness, et al by taking control manually.The camera is compact and portable.  You get about 1 1/2 hours of battery life during daytime use, and about half that if you're using the flash.  There's a feature that lets you know to the minute how much battery time you have left.This looks to have all the features of the 717 without the lensocentric style.Originally I was not planning on buying the telephoto lens, leaving that kind of work to my SLRs, but after seeing the image quality, fun, and ease of use of this camera, I'm getting it.Another great feature is that the camera plugs easily into any tv set to review pictures, movies, and even make a slideshow.  I was at a family gathering and this feature proved to be a big hit.As far as I'm concerned, the camera is flawless.Highly recommended.", "Date": "June 26, 2003"}, {"Title": "White Balance Issue:", "Author": null, "ReviewID": "RHNEN462W4981", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "In response to comments below:  The auto white balance in outdoors indirect sunlight issue is just an idiosyncrasy, not a deal breaker.  It's easy to work around.  Dpreview.com suggests setting the manual white balance to \"cloudy\".  I set the mode dial to \"P\", which is program-auto mode.  Essentially it's the full auto mode except you can adjust individual settings if you like.  In \"P\" mode, which is just one click from full auto mode on the mode dial, I have the white balance setting always on \"cloudy\", and let it do everything else automaticly.  Thus, when I find myself in indirect sunlight, I simply twist the mode dial one click to \"P\", and the white balance is properly adjusted every time.  Very simple.  You can see the adjusted white balance effect on the LCD before taking the photo to decide if you like the manual adjustment....................................All the cameras in this class, like the Canon G5 and Nikon Coolpix 5400 have their own idiosyncrasies.  None are perfect.  But with the Canon and Nikon, no matter what you do, you can't change the slow auto focus/shutter lag.  At least with the Sony DSC-V1, it's easy to correct the auto white balance for indirect sunlight....... just takes one click of the mode dial and you're all set........  This camera does so so many things extremely well, don't let the white balance thing detour you from purchasing it.", "Date": "July 31, 2003"}, {"Title": "I obsessed over the purchase...", "Author": null, "ReviewID": "R3KQ5OYKCPB6Q9", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I obsessed while shopping then bought the DSC-V1, and I have no buyer's remorse.  I'm very happy with it. I wanted a camera that delivered a balance of flexible user control, point and shoot simplicity, convenient size and great image quality. This is my first digital camera.  I wanted to get snapshot results that compete with my film cameras for 4x6 and 8x10 photos. I'm more than a casual camera owner: I own two film SLRs (Nikon 8080s), a land point and shoot (Olympus Stylus) and a weatherproof point and shoot (Minolta Weathermatic).I shopped online in detail.  I fell in love with the Canon S50 on paper because it had great specs and it seemed the right size for my wife to manage conveniently too (she likes her Olympus Stylus).  However, I looked at test pictures on the [...] site.  The bigger digital cameras (and the DSC-V1) seemed to outperform the S50, particularly in image sharpness.In the store, I made up my mind and decided on the Sony DSC-V1. I pointed the camera all over the store and at many objects, including my squirmy kid.  The Sony seemed to focus quicker than the other cameras that I played with. The Canon S50 was not as responsive as the Sony DSC-V1.  The low-light focusing aids on the Sony DSC-V1 are impressive.  They are cool too: The lasers remind me of the alien weapon aiming device in the movie, Predator.  Biggests Pros:\"It's the lens, stupid\" -Pictures have GREAT color and image resolution!  I'm simply amazed.  This little camera does a lot with the out-of-the-box, automatic settings.  Be careful not to fall in love with all the snazzy, tiny cameras if you are fussy about your images: You must remember that you can't do anything with a zillion megapixels if your lens is just too small or, worse, plain mediocre.Autofocus Performance -It feels fast and works rather well even in low light.  Errors made so far have been mostly mine.  With practice, I'm learning about the camera's limits. Right Size -The DSC-V1 is small enough to carry and big enough to handle steadily.  I'm clumsy yet this camera is easy for me to use with one hand.Design & Features-The camera has great features and specs, and it feels solid in your hands.  The little door for the I/O ports is a nice touch compared to rubber stoppers on some other brands. For the most part, the buttons actually do what you expect. The manual is well-written and well-organized.  Browsing was enough to get me going.  Without a manual, I bet you could play with the DSC-V1 for 15 minutes and accidentally stumble on how to set 80% of the relevant features.Low Light SensitivityI impulsively snapped several landscapes in the dusk and darkness to see what they would be like.  They were exposed nicely and displayed little/no camera shake. With a tripod, this camera will do wonderfully.Cons:Software - The software that comes with the camera is a little cheesy. After visiting the supplier's Web site and downloading updates, I got the camera squared away with my laptop (Windows 2000) and desktop (Windows XP). Be sure to follow the instructions and download the USB driver for your Windows 2000 machine, first. I did not and had some trouble with my laptop.Other Image Acquisition Software -Not everybody has drivers for their software to handle the DSC-V1 camera yet.  You may have to fuss a bit to get the camera to work with your software.Price-It's high.  It could be about $100 less, and it would be more competitive.Moving up from this compact camera, the next (small) step up would be to an Olympus 5050, a Canon G5 or the Nikon 5400.  From there, you would need to move to digital SLRs.  Net: It's a wonderous gadget with great usability features. It's much more fun than my SLRs because I like the instant gratification of seeing results on my laptop. I was slow to go digital. I'm glad I waited for the DSC-V1.  In a few years, I may add a digital SLR to my toybox.", "Date": "September 18, 2003"}, {"Title": "Excellent color balance and resolution, poor battery life.", "Author": null, "ReviewID": "RSQDLBR00399J", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I have an SLR that I use for \"serious\" photography, and a couple of small pocket sized film cameras that I use for \"street\" photography.

Prints through the digital workflow easily match the best I've made from my Nikon SLR with prime (non-zoom) lenses. Photoshop makes it easy to edit the pictures, fixing light reflection spots, framing problems, etc.Drawbacks: the battery life is not great. I quickly exhausted my battery on an afternoon-long shooting expedition. I've since bought a spare battery.The camera is small and somewhat hard to hold steady. Also, if you are in your 40s or older, it's hard to see the LCD screen without bifocals.The standard 32MB Memory Stick is a joke.

Every camera I looked at had its Pros and Cons.  I just had to decide which ones were going to have an affect on my final decision.  I ultimately went with this camera, because it was small, easy to configure and most importantly met my needs.  Don't expect to find a camera that doesn't have any cons.  I fell in love with it as soon as I took it out of the box.  I spent the first couple days reading and re-reading the 130-page manual to make sure I understood the different capabilities.  You have to do this if you expect to get the max benefits of this camera.  Even now I find myself having to regularly refer to the manual for help, because I'm not a professional photographer.  This is by no means an easy camera to master in one hour.  Yes, you can point and shoot, but you still have to read the manual and make some initial setup changes. This camera is a big improvement over my old one when it comes to image quality (no suprize here) and overall capabilities. The first thing I did was change the image resolution from 5 to 3.1 MP, because the 32mb memory stick that comes with the camera only allows to you shoot about 12 images (using fine print) and 23 images (using standard print).  You can always set the image size to VGA and can take up to 196 pictures.  I say if you're spending this kind of money, don't set it to VGA, because you pictures will be ok (as with other cameras) at best.  The higher resolution will allow you to print some great pictures on photo paper if you have a good hi-res printer.  I used an Epson Stylus Photo 825 ($100) and the results were great--much better than those you get in the mall. I went ahead and bought two 128mb memory sticks to cover me. The other thing I did was disable some of the camera's sound features (shutter and power-on sound) so I could save on battery power.  I would recommend buying a second battery through the internet since it's cheaper than getting them through Sony.  I also bought a separate battery charger so I wouldn't have to use the camera as a regular battery charger.  The last thing I would want to do is bake the components in the camera just to charge one battery or for that matter a backup. Excessive heat wears down electronic components over time. After I setup the camera, I took several pictures (using the flash) to see how if performed against my 1.6 MP.  The first thing I noticed is that the camera did a great job of regulating the intensity of the flash to make sure it wasn't too bright.  The camera allows you to manually set (3 levels) the intensity of the flash for any occasion if you decide you want to go manual. I connected the camera to my TV to view the pictures and they had extremely rich colors.  I tried doing some limited image editing like changing picture size, rotate pictures, etc.  You can view multiple pictures on the camera's small LCD screen which is very nice. Everything worked well.  I haven't tried the other features yet. A lot of technology went into this little camera so you'll have to be patient.  I just scratched the surface.  It makes no sense paying a lot of money for this camera if you don't intend to fully utilize its capabilities (read the manual). This camera is small in size so you'll have to get used to it and handle it with care.  You can purchase optional wide angle/zoom conversion lenses, but using them disables certain features of this camera camera.  I guess it's because the camera lense expands and retracts and it would bump up against the conversion lense.  The conversion lense also blocks some of the light intensity of your built-in flash.  Sony recommends using an external flash when using a conversion lense.  That means a lot of extra $$$.  Don't waste your money on the optional starter kit for this camera. The camera case is ok for the camera, but the memory stick case and spare battery will not fit well.  It's too tight for my taste. That last thing you want to do is damage the camera's protective lense cover.  I bought a samsonite camera case that is a little bigger it stores my camera memory stick case and spare battery.  You can go bigger if you choose to bring along your AV connecting cable, AC adapter and USB cable.  Overall, this is a great camera.

I agree with basically all of them. What hasn't been mentioned so far are a couple points that I find irresistable.I often read that consumers have no need for 5 megapixels. These are probably the same kind of people who said that nobody needed a Pentium desktop computer, that it was just too powerful for the average user. Plain and simple, more pixels means more flexibility, particularly when it comes to cropping. With 5 MP, you can crop out a lot of the image and still end up with a good 8 X 10. I do a lot of web work, which generally means low resolution mages. With 5 MP, I can take one shot of a room and split the image up into a dozen or more individual web shots, every bit as good as shooting a dozen small images. 5 MP (and PhotoShop) is essential for that kind of flexibility.Analog video outputs are also high on my list of requirements. This allows me to send what's on the LCD to a television or monitor, doubling the camera's use to include live web cam usage. It also allows you to watch the LCD from afar on an analog monitor at a much bigger image than the 1.5\" LCD. Fortunately, most better cameras include this feature these days.There are a lot of 5 MP cameras on the market, many much cheaper than the V1, so what makes this one worthy of consideration? Stunningly good images through the Zeiss lens and 640 X 480 videos with sound. This camera is small enough to carry around all the time, and you can take an acceptably good web movie on the spur of the moment at any time. With a 256 MB memory stick, you can even take 640 X 480 movies with sound for 10 minutes or more. As memory sticks get cheaper and larger, we will soon be looking at hours of video. The 1 GB stick already can hold almost 45 minutes. The rate limiting factor right now is cost. When 32 GB sticks are out, the 1 GB stick will be standard issue at less than $100. People will laugh that any camera ever came out with only 32 MB.Large, cheap storage capacities are coming quickly. The news as of 9-1-03 is that there is now a material which will allow transistors to be painted onto cheap plastic, rather than the expensive etching of silicon that we currently see today (see this at the Science News web site). High capacity storage will be dirt cheap inside a couple years, so I'd suggest you buy just enough storage to tide you over. 1 GB right now costs as much as the camera itself.Who shouldn't buy this camera? Anybody who can't come up with the scratch. If it's going to hurt, buy something cheaper. If money and portability are only small factors, you might want to consider the F717 instead. Images are a little bit better, and ergonomics are better as well. Also, anybody who can't get past the \"point and shoot\" mentality is buying a lot of power here that they will likely never use. If you are a \"point and shooter\" looking to be a good photographer someday, this is an excellent place to start. Probably the best choice out there for these people. Combine this with the \"Seven Books in One Digital Photography for Dummies\" and PhotoShop (even the lite version) and you've got a stunningly powerful image capturing and editing system that anyone can master. Combine it with one of the Sony photo printers and you'll get archival-quality pictures that last over 100 years. Ahhh....If high res and portability are high on the list, then you can't go wrong with the V1. It never leaves my side, just like the cell phone.

I did months of research and was all set to buy the highly rated Canon G3.  Caught wind that the G5 was soon to be released, thus delayed the purchase to see what the G5 offered.  The day came, went to dpreview.com to read the G5 review.  Stumbled across the Sony DSC-V1 review and knew right away, the Sony was the way to go for me.Why?  One central reason.  The Sony DSC-V1 takes just as good photographs, yet does it with an auto focus lag and shutter lag that is *twice* as fast as the G3/G5.  The DSC-V1 is just like using a film camera, you hit the button, it takes the picture, with almost no lag.The DSC-V1 isn't perfect.  Battery life is ho-hum, a second battery is a must.  At first it wasn't comfortable in the hand because of the small size, yet I've since gotten used to it and it doesn't bother me anymore.All in all, I'm very very pleased with the Sony DSC-V1.

Before V1, I mostly used Sony DSC-S85, although I also played with many other digital cameras over the years. There were a couple of things that annoyed me about S85 -- slow focusing (often over a second), and the large size. The V1 is small and incredibly fast at focusing -- 0.3 - 0.4 sec according to dpreview.com. Compare this to G5 and the other cameras in this class.  Some other highlights of V1:* Noise reduction for images with long exposure. I have taken some night-time pictures with exposures of 5 seconds, and they look great.* The focus is quite accurate, even when shooting in low-light conditions. Definitely better than S85. * This is apparently the first Sony camera whose firmware is user-upgradeable. Sony recently released firmware V.2 that adds several new languages. The next release may address the white balance problem (although I personally haven't experienced it). * This camera can use the larger memory sticks (up to 1GB currently). * There is a decent movie mode (640x480, 15fps). The duration of movies is only limited by the size of the memory stick. So in some special cases V1 can double as a video camera. * Very good image quality. The lens is slightly smaller than S85's, but the pictures look at least as good. Some downsides:* The battery is pricey and doesn't last very long at all. I can shoot about 80 images before running out of juice. Spare batteries are quite expensive. * No dioptre adjustment on the viewfinder. Overall, the V1 has exceeded my expectation.

I've owned Sony digital cameras for 5 years now and have never had any problems with any of the ones I've purchased (for me or my family).The V1 is a nice package... much more compact than the S75 and definitely the 707 or 717... but is much nicer to handle than any of their smaller Cybershot models.  It seems to have about as many features as the 717 .. except at a fraction of the cost.  Now I'm not a professional photographer, and I fumble around with the controls .. not quite sure what everything does.... So the manual is an important feature for me. This one is well written and answers questions quickly.  Picture quality is superb!  Instead of having the sizes set to 640x480 .. 1280x960 .. or any other combination.. the V1 uses the  megapixel ratings to let you know the size.. ie:  VGA, 1.2M, 3.1M, 5M, etc .. It really lets you know the size your images are going to be when you download them onto your computer.The nightframing & nightshot features are very cool!  You can take a picture .. in pitch black.. and it come out with excellent .. true to life color.The *only* thing that I have a problem with, is the power saving feature.  Once the flash fires, the LDC screen turns off and it 'powers down' for about 30 seconds while the flash recoups.  It comes back on, but that's precious picture taking time that you can't capture!  The S75 has a much better recovery time after the flash fires.  Sony needs to work on that one!  I would usually leave the red eye reduction on, and be able to shoot anytime w/ my flash as a fill... but now that's not such a great idea.  Guess I'll have to buy a flash for the hotshoe and hope that's not an issue there.Ok, so there's two issues.. Where the popup flash is located.  It really is not ideally situated .. as it's right where your finger would be on holding the camera. It's no biggie to retrain yourself to hold the camera different.. it's just gonna take a bit getting use to.All in all, I would recommend this camera.  The pictures are great!

The DC-240 finally went dead and I took it to Best Buy who, on their warranty, gave me the purchase value towards another camera, and thus the DSC-V1.  I have had the DSC-v1 for a little over a week now and have some interesting insights.  I generally look to Amazon for reviews and hope that you will find this one useful.  Please know that I am not a professional, and don't know a whole lot about photography (had a couple of classes in undergrad.)To set this up, I have a friend who, upon hearing that I had this money to spend, recommended that I buy a digital SLR.  Sounded great, but I wanted something that would fit into my pocket.  I was looking at a Kodak with 10x zoom, but when I went to purchase it, I realized that it did not fit into my pocket.  I am more prone to grabbing my camera if I can just toss it in my pocket and take it to a party, to shoot art, or take pictures of my dog!  So now to my take.  Please note that these are not necessarily pro's or con's but observations.-5MP WOW!  Image quality is great.  Coming from a 2MP, I am blown away!-USB2.0 is fast and a definite sales point to this camera.  Make sure you have 2.0 on your computer if you are planning on shooting large images!-The rechargeable battery is nice.  I don't know if I am sold on it yet though.  I am still pondering buying another battery should I be on vacation away from an outlet.-People have complained about the controls, I have big hands and they are not a problem.-I do have a problem holding the camera.  Go hold one before you buy it.  I like the camera and knew this going into it.  My left hand has the tendency to hold down or cover the flash, My right index finger has the tendency to cover the viewfinder.  I will learn to live with it...- The camera has tons of features, which was one of my reasons for purchasing it.  They can get a little confusing though.-If you are looking for a simple point and shoot, or a camera for your grandmother, this is not for her/you.-The display, although small, is adequate and clear.-I was looking into cameras with a greater zoom.  This 4x works great.-The camera works quickly with 5MP images allowing you to quickly zoom in and out and scroll through them.  The LCD displays them clearly-Menus are clear and precise.-The ability to control aperture, shutter speed, and focus is great.  It gives me the ability to treat this camera like an SLR.-The night framing/shot features are nice for shooting at night or indoors.  They allow you to frame a scene on the LCD before shooting the image.-The hot-shoe is a nice feature as I can connect this camera either to a professional flash OR a professional lighting kit to allow me to shoot artwork.All in all, this is a great camera.  If you are just looking for a point and shoot, this camera is not for you.  It is a lot of camera packed in a small package.  Be prepared to read the lengthy manual several times before getting SOME of the features down.  Also beneficial is some knowledge of basic photography, as terms such as metering, ISO, f-stop, and shutter speed are used often, and to fully understand the camera, working knowledge of these terms is necessity.", "Date": "June 29, 2004"}, {"Title": "Great value in a very nice package", "Author": "NewType", "ReviewID": "R1N30GNJIZVVI2", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Having learned photography on a film-based Nikon SLR, I'd been hesitant as well as disappointed with digital camera until now. I wanted a camera whose price wasn't too far in the pro territory, but I also wanted a camera that didn't make me feel like I was giving something up by going digital.When shopping for a camera, the things that were most important to me were:-shutter response-image quality-manual controls-intuitive menus and controls-image resolution-compactness-battery lifeI considered these all requirement, and set my standards high by deciding not to buy anything that would compromise any one of these things. These are all things digital cameras SHOULD have because if even one condition is lacking, the camera simply isn't good enough, bottom line.I'd tried out a friend's Canon G2, but absolutely hated it because of the shutter lag - the delay between you depressing the shutter and the camera taking the picture was just intolerable. The image quality and resolution was nice, but I also found the camera too bulky for my liking. I mean, the whole point of going digital was to lose some of the bulk, right?So I waited. I began eyeing the Minolta F100 and eventually the F300. I heard it had fast response. It had a very compact body (especially considering the 5 MP resolution of the F300) and while the image quality wasn't as nice as the Canons, I felt it was good enough that I could live with it. Plus, it had a full range of manual controls - I wanted to play around with long exposure shots or change the f-stop according to taste, and the F300 seemed to fit the bill.However, one thing that bothered me was that the Minoltas had very bad battery lives. I did some research and people were complaining about batteries running down after 50 or 60 shots using rechargeable NiCads. My friend's G2 could shoot 400+ shots on a single charge, which was one of the benefits of its bulk. Not so with the Minolta - the thought of having to change batteries on essentially the equivalent of two film rolls made me hesitate about purchasing.Canon also came out with the G3, but while the speed was much improved, I didn't like its bulk. The Canon S50 was essentially a smaller version of the G3, but I just didn't like the black-colored body compared to sleek silver. Yes, this seems like an especially minor point, but would you buy a car that came in a color you didn't like? If I was going to spend $... for a camera, I wanted to feel good about it.Then the Sony V1 came out. Within minutes of reading the review at dpreview.com, I knew this was the camera I wanted. I quick trip to Best Buy to play around with it confirmed my feelings. This camera is great for its price!The Sony DSC-V1 met ALL the requirements I listed above, with some extras such as the Nightframing and Nightshot modes. Battery life is good - about 100 to 200 shots, depending on flash use (the camera uses superior lithium ion batteries). It's got 4X optical zoom. REALLY easy-to-use controls and highly accessible menus (another thing I hated about the Canons - awful, convoluted menus!). The autofocus is very impressive, courtesy of the holographic metering system. I love the manual controls, too, but the thing that really seals the deal is the jog wheel that is present on nearly all Sony electronic devices. The jog wheel makes going manual a joy, instead of a frustrating experience of stabbing at buttons. If you've ever used film-based SLRs before, you'll know what I'm talking about.In addition, the V1 supports the new Memory Stick Pro format, which is much faster than the standard Memory Stick and also faster than either CompactFlash or SmartMedia, I believe. The Pro format offers capacities up to 1 GB (I bought a 256 MB Memory Stick Pro with mine - well worth it, as the price of the 1 GB stick is as much as the camera itself at this point!).The V1's firmware also appears to be upgradeable, as dpreview.com noted recently. So hopefully the problem of white balance in indirect sunlight will be corrected via a software update in the near future. But as I said, using the manual controls on the Sony is so easy due to the existence and placement of the jog wheel, it hasn't really been much of a concern for me.The only major disadvantage I can think of is that Sony doesn't seem to have too many accessories for the V1 yet. Some, like the external flash units, look ungainly and definitely don't look like it was designed for the V1 (more like the V1 was designed to support exisitng flash units). Hopefully, Sony will increase the offerings of accessories, but for now, the V1 is satisfying enough that I will be more than happily shooting away for quite a while.", "Date": "July 19, 2003"}, {"Title": "at last !", "Author": "G. peck \"gpeck@arctic.net\"", "ReviewID": "R2D3OZ4EPWCNPO", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Never mind the picture quality, this little camera works !

The camera is a little bit bulky and I can't carry it in my shirt pocket but a belt case has solved that problem.  I've found a second battery useful, although I can only recharge via the camera as I have not yet got a separate charger.  Have not found this an issue and I have been out all day with the camera.The video option is great. I've never really taken to video but this camera (and my three-year-old) might just convert me. It is easy to use.  You can't zoom when videoing nor does the flash work but the quality is acceptable and sound much better than I thought it could be.Recycling to take another picture can take a time but it seems that the flash is the slow-coach and pushing it down allows the camera to come back quicker whilst the flash is charged in the background.The low-light focussing is good, although the very-low contrast focussing uses a red hatching that is displayed on the subject which can be disconcerting and distracting for the subject.  It does allow, however, the camera to be held aloft for a different angle and the area being photographed confirmed.Overall a great product.

It has lots of advantages over other cameras.I also own a Sony DSC S-85, and a Canon S-400.Both of them excellent Cameras too, but with a different consumer target.Sony took some of the best features from the S-85, which is a \"Prosumer\" camera, and made it much smaller, like a compact \"point and shoot\" camera.These characteristics give several advantages to the DSC-V1.If you are the average photographer, you will probably just use the camera to point, shoot, and enjoy! And of course, you will want it to be handy and small.The DSC V1 will do that without a problem, using the Automatic setting, but you will have to learn some basics, (as with all other cameras). If you are learning photography, you are an amateur, or a Pro photographer that wants an small and excellent camera for hanging around, you will truly enjoy the Manual settings, as you can learn and experiment playing with the aperture, the speed of the shutter, the EV, the scenes, the effects, etc.Another great thing is that is not an expensive camera. Comparing the camera with other 5MP cameras, for example, the also beautiful (point and shoot only), Canon S-500, we will see that the prices of both cameras are almost the same. The Canon S-500 is smaller, takes beautiful pictures, and, of course, is a Canon.

This camera can work in fully automatic mode; scene mode where you tell the camera if you are shooting a beach, lake, landscape, snow scene, night scene or portrait night scene. If you want to you can work fully manual changing the aperture from f2.8 to f8.0, shutter speed from 30 sec to 1/1000 sec, and ISO (the image sensor's sensitivity to light) from ISO100 to ISO800. Other modes like shutter speed or aperture priority are available too. The nightframing function let you see through the LCD screen in completly darkness, so you see all with a green tone but when you press the shutter the flash pop up and record the image with natural color... if you want to you can  also record images without the flash using the nightshot function. The hologram AF works pretty well, you just press the shutter half-way down and the camera produces a lasser pattern that \"paint\" the subject helping the camera's foccusing system and showing you what portion of the scene are you pointing. Another great function is the live histogram, this is a graphic where the camera tells you if the picture you're about to take will be under-exposed or over-exposed, so this is continiously changing as you focus on a different subject or as you change the shutter speed or aperture.You can get interesting effects changing the white balance from the factory pressets light sources or telling the camera what is white just framing a white subject under the lighting condition you are working.Other functions include:- changing the focus operation from single focusing (you press the shutter halfway down to focus) to monigoring aF (you don't have to press the shutter to focus) and continuos focusing.- AE lock function. To measure the exposure of any portion of the image so after that you can recompose the picture and shoot with the exposure fixed to that especific portion of the picture.- You can record tv size video only limited by the memory stick capacity.- Can record pictures with sound.

P92 is very very easy to use, but V1 has a range of features not available in P92.1) it requires extra memory stick (which, as you might now is more expensive than compact flash). 256Mb is recommended. 128Mb provides 80 photos full-quality.

The NP-FC11 lasts about 80 minutes and take 2hrs to recharge.3) Unlike old Sony cameras, you can take pictures faster (whether P32, P92 or V1), but when using V1 with flash, you need to wait few seconds to energy recharge (a bad thing if you need the flash and don't want to miss a thing) - but it's like 3 seconds.4) A very nice feature is the nightframing and nightshots - it has infrared visor for very dark places.Comparing to P92, the improvements are amazing.

I took it to another shop for a second opinion and they said the same thing.  I went into panic mode again.  As a last ditch effort, I took the memory stick back to the guy I bought it off, battered my eye lids and told him how distressed I was about losing all my precious holiday shots, that I couldn't recover because we'd been on a big tour north.He plugged in a Sony portable printer in the shop, and luckily the machine was able to read the memory stick.  38 FREE photos later, I was a happy customer.  The guy even refunded my money for the stick which was faulty as far as I was concerned.  That day I also found my missing 128mb stick. It was a case of rent-a-stick when I needed it.  I was absolutely blown away by the quality of the 5mp photos combined with the Sony portable printer.  People in the shop crowded around to see my photos being printed.  They are amazing.  The guy took one extra print to go on display in the shop to show people what the Sony DSCV1 and the printer combined are capable of.The pop up flash took some getting used to, and my kids think the hologram red laser thingy is cool.  They think I'm zapping them.  What I like most about the camera is that it can be used as a point and shoot type camera for those that don't know much about photography, yet has aperature and shutter features so you can do the 'blurry background and streaky waterfall shots'. It's got a lot of room to grow into it.I like the fact that it can accomodate such features as a tripod, tele photo lenses, extra flashes, polarizing lens etc,  which you can buy later on when you get more experienced.I shopped around heaps on the net and in shops before I bought, but really fell in love with the size and cuteness of the camera, combined with it's smart technology and the fact that the battery can be recharged in the camera.  I didn't want to have seperate batteries that you take out, and my husband would no doubt borrow for his remote control yachts.Putting your pictures on tv is easy and I also run them through the video and take a slide show of them on video as a backup.I'm extemely happy with my new camera and see it will last me for many years technology wise.By the way, I now have a little box that I put my spare memory stick in that is clearly labelled, and too big to get sucked up in the vaccum cleaner.

Well the camera has survived many world trips, drops and still works great but I convinced my wife that it was time for a new one.  So we started our research and bought the Panasonic Lumix DMC-TZ5K since the reviews were awesome.Then we took our first picture - we looked at each other and thought - our Sony takes better pictures.  But I really wanted to love and keep this Lumix with HD video and all, so I took a slew of pictures with both cameras and asked my wife to tell me which ones she preferred - 90% of the time the Sony photo was preferred.  So we visited her friend that owned the same Lumix (maybe we got a defective one) and compared more photos (even swapped memory cards) and again the photo quality from the Sony was better.So how can all those reviewers get it wrong?  Because in most cases they never do a photo comparison but if you did, boy would you be confused - I think it is easier to just be happier in your bliss.We also tried a Canon SD850 and go the same results.So I still have my DSC-V1 because I feel like I would have to go with a DSLR to find better photo quality.  You can read all the reviews and specs until you eyes and head spin but in the end the proof is in the picture.I rated the camera 4 stars but I agree with the reviewers about the speed and flash placement but if you want a camera that takes great quality photos, is durable and very affordable then look no further.", "Date": "August 15, 2008"}, {"Title": "Very Slow Flash Recycle, bad battery life", "Author": "nsr \"Photo Hobbyist\"", "ReviewID": "R2ZU9P6C50XCZL", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "I owned quite few Digital Cameras, but the Camera's I used most before this are Sony DSC-S85 and Canon A80. I damaged my S85 during rafting(still works with Power Supply, but not with battery) and gave Canon A80 to my brother. I bought DSC-V1 because of rave reviews on sites like dpreview, stevesdigicam. Especially for faster focus, so that I can catch my kid in action.So, I will try to compare against S85 and A80.Compared to S85 and A80:1. Smaller than S85 but S85 has better grip, though I hate manual lens cover on S85. Bulkier than A80 and A80 has better grip.2. V1 focusses much faster than S85( 1.25 sec vs 0.6 sec) and still few outof focus because catching kids on camera is not that easy. A80 is faster than S85 but still slower than V1. But Autofocus is more accurate and far superior on A80 out of all three. It covers much area with 9 point AiAF. I tested all three at once, A80 locked focus when S85 and V1 failed. (esp plain background with little contrast). V1 With all that hitech Laser pattern only checks for the contrast in only little center area(though 5 point , but all around/near the center). It fails to focus even when there are object in sides of the frame(not in center). V1 Continous Auto Focus option helps little bit in catching those little kids though.3. Battery life is not even half of that S85, just one hour of typical usage, so extra battery with a charger is must. So extra money/luggage too. In the case of A80, You drop a set of Hi-Capacity Ni-MH AAs and forget it for few weeks.4. Main problem, Flash recoup is really slow, anywhere between 7 -10 seconds. if you choose power save mode, it is around 20 seconds by the time camera is ready for another shot, (as another review has mentioned it). So, any indoor flash photography is a problem especially with kids. It won't let you take photo until the flash it completely charged. If you press shutter button before it charges completely, you have to release, and do it again. With S85 it is less obvious, and A80 hardly noticable.5. Any indoor snaps without flash is ruledout, tried using higher  ISO400, max aperture, exposure compensation etc.  I think both S85 and A80 is little better, but not by much.6. picture quality is on par with S85 I think. I did not feel quality is any better than S85. I felt A80 is little better than these two, especially the JPEG compression.7. Though Canon A80 had rotating LCD, resolution and quality is not as good as S85 and V1.(this has been addressed in A95 with 1.8\" hi-res LCD).I have been experimenting since last 2 weeks, and above were the few things I observed.I considered Canon A95, Sony DSC-W1 and this one(Canon G5 is little bulky and slow autofocus). I was getting all these around the same price, but I though V1 has 4x optical and Zeiss Vario-Sonnar lense( I think Vario-Sonnar is better than W1's Vario-Tessar) and W1 had many complaints about JPEG compression artifacts and not somany manual controls.So, Now, I am thinking should I go for Canon A95? or should  think of Casio EXILIM PRO EX-P600 which is veryfast and comes with Canon lense(this is $50 more).???I hope this one helps atleast some people to decide if this camera fits the bill for them.", "Date": "December 29, 2004"}, {"Title": "This camera takes excellent photos!", "Author": "Dani Nymeyer", "ReviewID": "R22GOX0X77WIHF", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "This is one of the first cameras I have ever owned, I found that it is a little too advanced for the beginner photographer, but is a great bridge from beginner to a little more advanced.First off, just let me say how pleased I was with the photos this camera takes.  Great, great quality.  I was even more pleased when I took the photos onto the computer and I blew it up several sizes--the pictures stayed nice and clear.Using full automatic mode, I have read some customers complain about color saturation problems...it's almost as if they are talking about a different camera, because I am experienced no problems like that.  This camera makes very close to real life colors...and, if by some chance, you do happen to experience some sort of color saturation problems, there is a manual override that will work just nicely.The camera is very easy to handle all of the features.  It's not confusing at all, even for the more of a beginner photographer.There is only one thing that I am going to have to complain about concerning the camera functions...The shutter speed, I thought, was way too slow.  This camera seems so advanced that you would think that the shutter speed would be fairly fast...but it's not.  You have to hold down the shutter for a few moments before the picture finally takes.  And when it does take, it takes several seconds for the picture to save...I found one flaw in the camera design--the location of the flash.  It's on the top on the very left hand side (left hand side when the lens is point away from you).  It's a weird place because in order to hold the camera properly, you have to lay your finger right on top of the flash.  Which is just fine, when you are not using the flash, but when you do want to use the flash you will want to put your finger right on top of it, because it feels comfortable to do that.  However, you can't use the flash if you do that!  So, then you will probably result to putting your finger on top of the silver band around the lens, but that won't work either because your finger will be in way of the flash.The location of the flash is the only camera design defect that I have come across, though.  Otherwise, this is a nice camera that takes really splendid pictures.  I'd recommend this camera to the beginner photographer passing over to an intermediate photographer.  If you are looking for a compact camera, this is a pretty good compact camera.  It gets great pictures, and is pretty much compact.  Although, it is not completely portable, it's a little bigger than a lot of the compact cameras out there...but, you have to keep in mind the megapixels that you are getting.  5.0 megapixels, and lots of features.  A very nice camera, I am quite pleased with it.  Although, the flash defect has led me to looking for a new camera, because I just find that defect a little too hard to over-come.

(The quality is great... it's a _BIT_ choppy, but how many of us take really long video's of something really important? Few. But this is nice to have if you need some interesting clips!3) 5-megapixel -- this is more for marketing these days unless you plan on printing 8x10's or larger photo's. The bpp doesnt change it's only the resolution (or in english terms, dimensional size of the print) that changes as you add megapixels. I personally shoot 1.2mp all the time. It's nice though, having the option to take something in 5mp in case I ever want a high-quality print!4) Compact w/4x (analog) zoom. We've all seen 100,000x digital zoom... WHO CARES? You can just \"zoom digitally\" once the print is on your machine, quality isn't going to be greater--I'm pretty sure this is true, don't quote me on it though.So those are pretty much the biggest reasons... which mattered to me, living in the \"point-and-shoot-and-forget-about-it\" world.

It has 5 megapixels, which is actually just the right size for most people who will be getting prints made.After testing and using some of the new models of digicams with high megapixels, I used to think that more megapixels meant better quality, but that's not true.  I have learned that higher MP on a smaller camera with a smaller sensor means more noise and graininess, there's just no way to get around it.The DSC-V1 does not have this problem.  I have taken photos with this camera that turned out crystal clear with little to no noise whatsoever, when viewed at 100% in Photoshop.  This camera does the best at photo quality that would make great prints.The only downside is that the videos are a little jerky, and the small batteries it comes with do not have LONG battery life.  Sometimes it does have a problem focusing on dark settings, sometimes darker photos might turn out a little blurry, but that could probably be fixed with tinkering with the manual settings like f-stop, etc. if I knew more about that kind of thing.

The main reason for this is the \"Night framing\" ability that allows you to see an IR picture of what you are framing, then when you take the picture it shoots a normal flash (this is not the same as a night shot where the picture itself is a IR image, this just lets you aim.)  In addition, when you don't have the ability to see the LCD, you can use the AF laser emitter to target your images.  Either way, if you get a camera that does not have these features, its always guess work if you have the subject in frame if its dark.I will never buy another camera that does not have these features.  I cannot believe they are not standard on all digital cameras.As for red eye, I would not use the anti red eye feature on the camera.  It makes people squint in the follow flash.  Use either editing software or better yet, get the off camera flash and bracket accesory for natural red eye reduction and shadows.If you are thinking about this camera, accessories I would almost say MUST be budgeted are:  The leather flip case with strap (not the stupid pouch case), extra battery, 512mb memory stick and if you intend to use the 5mp that you are paying for and want to send your pix, you should ABSOLUTELY purchase a copy of Sharegear file sharing software (not a Sony product).  It is hands down the pest way to share video and pix.  It's also the cheapest ($20.00, one time), but that is just a bonus.  (you need dsl/cable to use it effectively).An almost must have accessory is the HVL-F32X smart flash and bracket.  It makes the camera a bit bulky, but dang those images look good.  An external flash off camera will always beat a built in flash for taking people pix.  I don't care how nice the camera is.Another word about the MP's. 5MP is enough.  Higher than that is great if you need to count the hairs on a fly, but the price in storage cost (MB per image) is probably not worth it.  If you don't even use the full MP, then why upgrade your camera?  That's just me.Hope this helps.

My biggest concern was the ergonomics of the sony V1, having the flash placed where it was.  I really wanted the small sized camera so that placed sony first. I have small hands so I thought I could adapt to the flash on the left side.  I also liked the Zeiss optics which came with the V1.  The nikons are sexier with the black color and fit well in my hand, but there were so many good features to the V1...night focus, in camera battery charging, a nice sized lens (136mm), no shutter lag, bright LCD etc.  that I returned to the sony and bought it.  Besides, I didn't want another large camera. I am very happy with the V1's small size and Zeiss optics and I have found the V1 easier to handle than the 5400 to handle.

(The quality is great... it's a _BIT_ choppy, but how many of us take really long video's of something really important? Few.

The bpp doesnt change it's only the resolution (or in english terms, dimensional size of the print) that changes as you add megapixels. I personally shoot 1.2mp all the time. It's nice though, having the option to take something in 5mp in case I ever want a high-quality print!4) Compact w/4x (analog) zoom. We've all seen 100,000x digital zoom... WHO CARES? You can just \"zoom digitally\" once the print is on your machine, quality isn't going to be greater--I'm pretty sure this is true, don't quote me on it though.So those are pretty much the biggest reasons... which mattered to me, living in the \"point-and-shoot-and-forget-about-it\" world.

Otra cualidad que hace de la dsc-v1 muy superior a la dsc-p10 es que tu puedes elegir el m\u00e8todo de disparo entre: 1)modo autom\u00e1tico (el enfoque, la exposici\u00f3n y el balance de blancos son autom\u00e1ticamente ajustados lo que te permite una facilidad de disparo...\u00e8sta es la \u00fanica funci\u00f3n que posee la dsc-p10) 2) disparo autom\u00e1tico programado (tu puedes cambiar la combinaci\u00f3n del valor F y la velocidad de disparo) 3)prioridad de velocidad de disparo (esta funci\u00f3n te permite disparar un objeto en movimiento r\u00e1pido congel\u00e1ndolo) 4) modo de prioridad de apertura (\u00e8sta funci\u00f3n te permite cambiar la profundidad del enfoque brind\u00e1ndote ambos, el objeto y el fondo dentro del enfoque o disparar a un objeto con un fondo borroso. y 4) modo de exposici\u00f3n manual (tu puedes manualmente ajustar la velocidad del disparador y los valores de apertura lo que te permite disparar en situaciones de acuerdo a tus prop\u00f3sitos). Lo que yo podr\u00eda decir en contra de \u00e8sta extraordinaria c\u00e1mara es una falla de dise\u00f1o al colocar el flash (que salta) en el lado donde normalmente tu colocas tu dedo izquierdo para disparar pero creo que nada es perfecto y con el tiempo aprendes a agarrarla correctamente. Otras cualidades en contra y que muchos ya han mencionado (propias de todas las c\u00e1maras Sony) son: 1)la poca duraci\u00f3n de la bater\u00eda (que se compensa adquiriendo una de repuesto) y los 32MB del memory stick que es una broma y que tambi\u00e8n se compensa adquiriendo uno de 128MB \u00f3 de 256MB. Espero sea de ayuda.
