You think you are getting 16 of both ends when it is only 8 of each.  Additionally, when I stripped the wiring back to make connections the wire looked like it had been stored under water.  The copper was corroded and it easily broke.  This is a very convenient product, but the quality is poor.", "Date": "January 28, 2013"}, {"Title": "excellent customer service", "Author": "WB", "ReviewID": "R26OFXLPLD3F80", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I ordered theses connectors thinking I could connect 16 cameras to the power distribution box withthis package.
