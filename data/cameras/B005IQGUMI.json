{"Reviews": [{"Title": "2012 Travel Zoom Digital Camera Round-Up / WB750", "Author": "Randy Wakeman \"Randy Wakeman\"", "ReviewID": "R3G7WWQLI4LZP2", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "2012 Travel Zoom Digital Camera Round-UpWay, way back in 2009, a lengthy group test of pocketable long-zoom travel cameras was performed by one of the most popular sources for digital camera reviews. It was only three years ago and the camera specifications were all within a narrow range: The tested cameras all had 10 - 12MP CCD sensors, zoom ability was 10x-12x, none could record video at full 1080 HD, and most screens were of the 230k pixel, 2.7 inch to 3 inch variety. The winners in that match-up happened to be Panasonics, with Panasonic ZS-3 having a street price of $380 or thereabouts, at that \"ancient\" time.Onto 2011, where another, larger group test was conducted. The cameras as a class offered BSI (back side illumination) sensors more often, LCD screen resolution was improved to 460k (or better) and the long zoom notion was no longer 10x, but 14x to the (at that time) 18x Nikon S9100 as the class leader in the zoom department. GPS units were added as a \"feature\" and the winners were the Canon SX230 (a verdict I agree with) and the Nikon S9100 which I personally found to be a spectacular disaster of a camera.It is just a year later, and BSI sensors have become standard fare, claimed to be twice as sensitive as the CCD variety. The 14x zoom of the 2011 Canon SX230, actually a fine camera, now seems anemic compared to the 16x - 20x base capabilities of the current crop. I don't particularly subscribe to putting a price on a memory, but as a bonus 2012 compact long zooms, despite having more expensive sensors, greater usable magnification ranges, better video capability, and more features the price of entry is no more, often less than three years ago.Some of the common \"complaints\" about this class of camera are nonsensical. You'll redundantly hear about the lack of an EVF, the electronic viewfinders, RAW capture (meaning s-l-o-w with the intent of post-processing) and some equally nonsensical carping about low-light. The reason to enjoy this class of camera is that it fits in a shirt pocket, weighs one half pound or less, and has long zoom capability. If you don't care about bulk, heft, and zoom range . . . you are looking at the completely wrong platform of camera for your needs. The camera in your pocket captures the event when the others are not with you. A seven ounce camera is more pleasant to carry than a two or four pound hunk of equipment; a 16x zoom offers composition possibilities that no 3.8x, 4x, and 5x zoom can possibly match.Of more importance is shooting performance, handling, overall speed. No one wants a camera they have to wait for-- by then, the shot you wanted may already have ceased to exist. Image stabilization ability is also a very important component of this class of camera. There are only three basic components: lens, sensor, processor. The software / cpu combination is often designated as an \"engine,\" with a newer bit of programing called a better version of the engine. How they work together, under the most diverse circumstances, is what makes for the satisfying travel compact long zoom. The basics, in 2012, for a camera to qualify as a modern compact travel zoom appears to be 15x zoom or better, a BSI sensor, and at least some HD video capability.Of the last dozen cameras I've spent quality time with over the last year, few actually qualify as those that I can confidently recommend. The 2011 Canon SX230 is one, as is the current enhanced zoom (20x) 2012 Canon SX260. The 2012  Panasonic ZS-15 is another, perhaps the most well-rounded and versatile value out there to this point. The unevenly performing Fuji F660EXR was a failboat with the horrific video performance sending it soundly to the cannot recommend list.Now comes a final 2012 model long-zoom compact, the Samsung WB750. It is easy to confuse the WB750 with the Wi-Fi version, the WB750F, but they are different cameras with different sensors: the \"F\" edition has a 14.2 MB CCD type sensor, not the 12.5 MB BSI CMOS of the WB750. The WB750F also lacks full HD video, stereo audio, the slow-motion video modes, and so forth. It is easy to confuse the two, my feeling is that Samsung could have made the differences far more easy to discern. Yet, the $350 or so W850F model does have a BSI sensor, further adding to the muddle.Sensor size is perhaps the best barometer of image potential, though the industry seems to go to great lengths to disguise it. More megapixels on a tiny surface means each photosite gets less light, must be smaller, and  there is more opportunity for signal cross-talk. Yet, the number of megapixels has long been touted, though more megapixels tends to diminish image quality potential.The WB750 was actually announced September 1, 2011, to little fanfare. The original press release stated, \"Samsung Electronics Co., Ltd, a global leader in digital media and digital convergence technologies, today announced the launch of the WB750 camera - featuring a proprietary BSI (Back Side Illuminated) CMOS sensor that ensures consistent professional images and video. Featuring a newly-redesigned image sensor, lens and image processor, the WB750 brings to bear a range of new technologies to deliver unprecedented levels of performance and ease-of-use. The WB750 also features an 18x optical zoom with 24x Smart Zoom technology, making it the longest ever zoom in Samsung's compact camera portfolio.\"  Rightly or wrongly, mostly wrongly, we tend to pay more attention to brand names than actual product. It tends to mean that Sony, Nikon, Canon, and Panasonic get better coverage whether deserved or not. Such is the blinding power of the mythical world of product branding.While the specifications of the Samsung WB750 would have been astounding a year prior to its original announcement, most of them in July, 2012, fit the middle of the road. A year ago, the 18x zoom would have been equaled by very few, such as the frustratingly bad Nikon CoolPix S9100 I tried to work with, that sounded like a tractor when I used it, had erratic image stabilization for stills and no effective image stabilization for video. The WB750 has essentially a 24-432mm range, wider than many, has a panoramic feature that Canon still doesn't, and offers smaller image size high-speed video that many lack: 440fps @ 224x160 and 250fps @ 368x272 pixels. In night scene mode, the shutter speed goes all the way down to 16 seconds if you prefer.For purposes of comparison, I'm pitting the Samsung WB750 primarily against the Panasonic ZS-15, perhaps my favorite travel zoom to date.Battery life: Panasonic wins, though not by much at 260 shots vs. 225 for the WB750 (CIPA standard). Both have in-camera charging, requiring the purchase of an external charger to avoid taking the camera out of commission by plugging it in.Lens:  f/3.2 - f/5.8, 18x, 24mm-432mm for the Samsung vs. F3.3 - F5.9, 16x, 24mm-384 mm for the ZS-15. Advantage Samsung, for the slightly brighter lens and longer true optical zoom, though neither \"advantage\" is apparent to me.Size: At 4.15 in. x 2.34 in x .98 inch thick  and a weight of 6.7 oz., the Samsung  is notably slimmer than the 6.6 oz. 4.13 x 2.27 x 1.31 inch Panasonic ZS-15.  The stated thickness is misleading from both companies, as the cameras are thicker through the lens portion than published. The Samsung is still the thinner camera, if minimally.LCD: Both have 460K three inch LCD's. They are close, a slight edge to the Panasonic for its \"high angle mode.\"Price: The Samsung is currently available at $150 - $170 street, clearly less than the $190 - $230 recent pricing of the Panasonic ZS-15. For the record, I actually paid $150 for my WB750 vs. $230 for my ZS-15. This isn't exactly dinner, dancing, and Chilean Sea Bass money difference but still-- the Samsung is currently a better value by a clean forty dollars, if it does what you want it to do.Video: The Samsung is more fully featured with stereo sound and high-speed capabilities. Also, the full18x true optical zoom is available during video as well. The WB750 allows taking a few *full* resolution stills during video where the Panasonic captures two total in 3.5M (16:9) reduced resolution. The Samsung's fast zoom easily outruns its autofocus ability. However, the Samsung picks up far less camera noise with the \"Sound Alive\" on and as a result, it has superior audio quality.Shooting Performance: Start-up times to first shot are both quick, 1.6 seconds for the Panasonic vs. 1.7 seconds for the Samsung. The Panasonic, if anything seems to focus faster but both are reasonably quick. Neither camera is going to keep you waiting; both offer 10fps burst modes if only for a limited number of frames at full resolution: 4 frames for the Panasonic, 8 frames for Samsung at 10fps. Shot to shot times are similar, about one second for the ZS-15, about 1-1/4 seconds for the Samsung. The Samsung gives you a brief \"processing\" screen more often than the ZS-15 does. The Panasonic is far peppier when using the flash at 2 seconds vs. 3 seconds or so for the Samsung. The slow-charging flash of the Samsung is a negative.Videography: Travel zooms, as a class, are very poor substitutes for camcorders. The audio invariably picks up some motor noise and due to the pathetically small mics, audio quality is limited with no possibility of using an external mic. Still, some are better than others with a recently tested Fuji F660EXR yielding uniformly tragic results. Yet, the Samsung has the cleanest audio of the long-zoom compacts I've tested this year.Unlike many travel zooms (Canon SX230) both the Panasonic ZS-15 and the Samsung can take a few stills while you are recording video. In the case of the ZS-15, the value is dubious to non-existent. In an indoor, very low-light test I found that the ZS-15 captured very clear, sharp, ISO 1000 stills. You get but two still captures in video mode, they are 3.5M, and used under the same conditions they were not only low-resolution, but captured at a horribly grainy ISO 3200. Most small travel zooms pick up motor noise when zooming: it is to be expected. The best solution is avoid zooming as much as possible, or displace the audio with music, etc. Samsung at least recognizes this with a \"Sound Alive On\" mode that is designed to reduce zoom noise. It does work, actually far better than I expected. While the Samsung does have stereo mics, this advantage is primarily a \"spec-sheet only\" benefit in a compact travel zoom with tiny onboard mics that can offer minimal stereo separation. Nevertheless the Samsung shines brightly in audio quality compared to the Panasonic.The current notion of wanting, much less needing 1080p capture from a non-dedicated still camera is silly, more marketing than beneficial. Too soon we forget the movies we enjoyed, and still enjoy from the \"lousy\" DVD format: 29.97 fps, 480 interlaced resolution. Yet, DVD is still the dominate medium in market share. Resolution alone is a very poor indicator of video quality. Consider that even the full HD of 1080 rates only as low resolution in still image terms. The native resolution of the Panasonic ZS-15 sensor is 4000x3000, I suppose we'd call it 3000p if it was video, the native resolution of this Samsung is 4096x3072.Clearly, the notion of sensor native resolution does not translate into any meaningful measure of video prowess, nor does the resolution of the video mode itself. In a compact long zoom, the best that can be hoped for is in-focus moving images with good color fidelity, the notion of excellent audio quality is a myth. This is why, from a video perspective, there isn't too much to get excited about here, nor could there be. The best video is obtained when not zooming at all and with the use of a tripod for full zoom. Even then, audio quality can only be amateurish. The edge in video goes to the Samsung, as full-resolution images can be taken while in video mode, and the Samsung offers more fun novelty-type modes, including high-speed capture.ConclusionsThe Samsung WB750 comes as an unexpectedly pleasant surprise. Prices vary for all kinds of reasons with digital cameras but I can't call the WB750 at $150 - $170 anything less than a spectacularly good bargain. It joins the Panasonic ZS-15 and the Canon SX260 as the only compact long-zooms I can recommend to anyone seeking this platform of camera.The Panasonic \"Intelligent Zoom\" does retain image sharpness better than its competitors when exceeding its true optical limitation; Samsung has a \"24x Smart Zoom\" that is essentially an in-camera crop. There is a curve of diminishing returns when magnifying images: I'm just not clever enough to be able to tell you what it is. The \"long zoom\" compact used to be 10x, but I certainly have had several instances where that proved insufficient. Even last year's Canon SX230, a very competent unit, seems underpowered compared to all three of these despite its 14x zoom. Twenty-eight percent more zoom ability in the WB750 vs. the SX230 is substantial but the eleven percent additional of the SX260 vs. the WB750 is far less noticeable. Note the Canon lens is F3.5 wide-angle to F6.8, a bit slower than either the Samsung or the Panasonic, but in real-world terms this isn't a noticeable difference. They are all competitive; where the true optical zoom becomes the most noticeable is during video capture, something that none of the three do superbly well. Those that want the 20x of the Canon and think the GPS is of value could be easily swayed. In my terms, for my uses, the Samsung and the Panasonic are better fits.The Samsung is a slight winner in pocketability, with a thickness of just under an inch, in at least some areas. Both of the others are about 30% thicker in places: the Samsung can be slipped in where the others cannot.The display is vital for shot composition. All three have generally good, 460K displays. The Panasonic display is more reflective, yet that is combated by Power LCD\" and \"High Angle\" modes. The Samsung has an auto mode, but gives you three basic choices: normal, dark, and bright. It doesn't sound as sexy or technological as \"Power LCD\" but it is the same idea. Canon features the \"PureColor II G\" LCD, which also imposes a bit of needless technobabble.  Non are as good as the higher-resolution, 921k screens, as good as the fold out and swivel \"articulated\" LCDs, or nearly as good as an EVF in bright sunlight. Yet, they are all larger (3 inch) than the standard fare of a couple of years ago and are double the pixels of the screens of a couple of years ago as well. None are anywhere close to perfection in bright, sunny conditions but all are improved and far more helpful when reviewing images prior to transfer to your PC.If you feel a GPS is invaluable or the 20x optical zoom is vital, then the Canon SX260 will likely be your choice. Neither of these features are particularly important to me, the GPS of precisely zero benefit, so for me . . . the SX260 would be a 3rd place choice, yet it is a very, very good long-zoom compact with no great negatives to stop the purchase excepting price, although by some (Sony) levels, the Canon seems a strong value.That leaves the ZS-15 and the Samsung and it is a very difficult to find a clear winner. I can't shake the feeling that if this Samsung had \"Sony\" branded on it, it would have already have been heralded as the marvel of the age and the loudest screaming deal of screaming deals. It is a sleeper in the compact long zoom class, largely ignored compared to competitive models without solid basis that I Have been able to discover.Yet, the all-round shooting performance of the ZS-15 is faster than the Samsung; the ZS-15 processor is clearly quicker. The Samsung creative modes are surprisingly good, the audio is better, and the full-resolution still ability during video is of clear value. The Samsung rendition of the Panorama mode is excellent; up / down / left / right, just move the camera and the WB750 does the rest. And, you have more smart filters to experiment with as well as high-speed video.The all-around winner, for my purposes, is the Panasonic ZS-15, with a higher percentage of \"keeper\" photos than the rest in a variety of conditions. The Samsung WB750 remains a great value, as it is both feature-laden, economical, and takes very good video if you lay off the zoom and the audio is actually very clean. For indoor use, it falls behind both Panasonic and Canon for its turtle-slow to charge up flash, and both weak and unpredictable color saturation and cast. You can get decent indoor pictures with the Samsung, but all too often it is a slow and tedious process.The Panasonic ZS-15 wins, the Samsung remains a surprisingly good value best suited for outdoor use and also if the audio quality of your video is important to you. The Canon SX260 gets the nod if you want a GPS, is still a very worthy travel companion, but it lacks in the video department, and does not have the manual controls of either of the more economical choices, nor a panorama mode.In the value department, the WB750 is very hard to fault and the full-resolution during video ability is something most of its competition lacks. Nevertheless, its shooting performance is only average compared to the ZS-15 and SX260: the ZS-15 @ fifty bucks more, the SX260 at about twice the price.For video ability and 18x zoom value, the Samsung does well. Six-eight months ago, it would have been far more appealing though, as today (12/2012) the ZS-15 is a better still-image camera with prices now running as low as $149, the ZS-15 is tough to beat.Copyright 2012 by Randy Wakeman and Randy Wakeman Outdoors.

The images are clear, sharp. - The 3\" display is bright, even in daylight. - The camera has a well made and solid feel to it. - Smart Mode (the Samsung version of full auto) really is pretty smart.  All I have to do is make sure the image is composed properly and the camera does the rest.  I do most of my picture tak'n with a DSLR in manual mode and even though this camera does allow me to do that too, I leave it set to Smart Mode most of the time, relax, and still get great pictures. - 24mm wide angle.  I know everyone raves about the 18x zoom (and I will too).  However, also important is that this camera zooms out wider than most in its class.  That means I can capture large groups or wide expanses without having to back up or rely on the (excellent) panorama capabilities.  Wider also means greater depth of field but either you already know that or it's too geeky to explain in this review.  - 432mm optical zoom.  This is extremely long and the camera still manages to capture clear images even without a tripod.  That is because the optical stabilization works real well. - Great low light sensitivity. - Panorama mode.  Very well thought out.  None of this taking multiple images and having the camera stitch them together afterwards.  Just hold down the shutter and pivot.  The camera builds the image as you turn. - Movie mode that works.  It's true hi def.  Also handy (and not available in some other cameras in this class) is the zoom works while you are making the movie.  I also like that you can capture stills at the same time you're taking a video. - There's a burst mode (that finally makes sense).  Sure, just about every camera has something it takes a bunch of pictures starting from when I press the shutter.  So does this one.  However, there's another mode called Precapture where it starts to take pictures when I half press the shutter and *stops* when I press the shutter all the way.  The final eight images are saved.  Aim the camera at your child when they step up to the plate, half press the shutter, and press all the way when you see them contact the ball.  No guessing or worrying about reaction time and somewhere in the eight images that were captured just before, and at the instant when, you pressed the shutter is just the right pose. - The tons of other features that you may use and will have fun playing with.  For example, creative backgrounds like magazine covers on which your picture is placed, the ability to create slide shows, and the ability to add effects to an image *after* you've taken the picture. - Easy photo download and charging using a standard micro-USB cable.  One is included, along with a anywhere-in-the-world charger.  Most people don't need another USB charger (you can also use your laptop, for example) and probably already have the cable too.  Still, it's nice to have. - There is no manual.  I count this as a feature; I'm tired of paying for a printed manual (if it's included then you're paying for it) that has print too small to read and b/w images which tell me nothing.  This comes with a .PDF on CD which is nicely produced in full color and of course indexed, searchable, and in dozens of languages.What I didn't like so much: - Does not capture in Raw mode. - For a camera in this price range I'm starting to expect a built-in GPS.  This takes me to... - Samsung has announced the WB850.  It's this camera with a 21x zoom (starting a touch wider at 23mm), an even better display, built-in WiFi, and... wait for it... a built-in GPS.  I've started to see the price of this camera start to drop.  If you don't need the GPS then this camera will become an even better value.  I already get the WiFi capability with a Eye-Fi Connect X2 4 GB Class 6 SDHC Wireless Flash Memory Card EYE-FI-4CN.Final thoughts: - This is already a great camera value that I expect will become even greater as the newer model drives the price down. - This camera fits into my Case Logic TBC-312 Pocket Video Camcorder Case with Storage (Black) perfectly.", "Date": "March 5, 2012"}, {"Title": "Excellent camera with awesome zoom", "Author": "Michael L.

Though the camera depth, with the lens protrusion included, is 1.3\" not <1\" as you will see advertised by Samsung. That's the same as Nikon Coolpix S9100 which too has a 18x optical zoom.2. Image stablization works even with optical zoom extended.3. Picture quality and focus was good even in low light.4. Panorma mode implementation is very nice (doesn't require you to fill predefined buffer sizes as in Sony models).5. Flash is in front, unlike the irritating pop-up variety which keep getting under your fingers and require you to hold the camera specially.6. Cover for HDMI/connector to USB port is quite sturdy (unlike flimsy plastic used by other manufacturers).I was liking this camera better than Casio Exilim ZR-100, SONY Cybershot DSC HX9V and Nikon Coolpix S9100 (all of which I have tried personally) and would have given a very high rating (4.5 stars) until it turned out to be defective and I had to deal with Samsung customer service.Cons:1. The camera does some processing of photos before saving, so even with a Class 10 SD card it introduces an annoying delay.2. The LCD screen coating came off after just 3 days of use. It started as a smudge in the center which spread. The screen is functional but part of it is coated and part isn't. Also I gather this is not their nicer OLED screen.3. Samsung customer service is your worst nightmare. I tried to enter a repair request on their website and got errors with both IE9 and Firefox. I then tried using their online chat representatives and ended up wasting 30 minutes. The first one (Rebecca) transferred me to a second one (Gary C) who eventually just terminated the chat without entering the service request. I had to call 1800SAMSUNG 4 times to just get a service request recorded. The first time they just hung up, the second time I was left to hear a shrill ringing, the 3rd time I was put on extended hold, the 4th time with a bit of yelling I was able to at least get them to record a complaint. The rep Tracey tried to say that we damaged the camera and I was being defensive - even though it wasn't her job and not sure what prompted her to conclude that. From the conversation she seemed to be unable to differentiate a camera from a camcorder and lens from the LCD. When I didn't hear back from their repair center in 2weeks (even though I was promised atmost 48hrs wait) I filed a complaint with Better Business Bureau. That made them call me, but I still had to spend quite some time on phone and email them 4 times before they acknowledged the problem with the camera. They agreed to replace it on 22nd Feb but after repeated remiders told me 3weeks later that its not in stock (when it is at dozens of retailers)! Bottomline is that Samsung may have good designers but their customer service and repair centers have extremely incompetent people (I had a similar experience when trying to get my DVD VCR combo repaired).Chat transcript with my personal info removed below:---Please wait for a Samsung Agent to respond.You are now chatting with 'Rebecca'.

But it has so many useful features and functions that you don't find in cameras in this price range. The keyword here is \"useful\". While a lot of cameras have many gimmicky features, those in this Sammy are actually something you want to use.The built quality is high. The controls are well placed. Menu is reasonably initiative. The photo quality is great.It's half the price of my last Panasonic but I am twice as happy with this Sammy - although I do like my Panny a lot.Pros:Schneider lens. For those who may not know, Schneider is a world famous optics maker best known for their large-format camera and enlarger lenses.Good optical zoom range. So, it's not a super zoom but to be honest you don't want a super zoom in a P&S.; It's very difficult to make a long zoom lens in a compact body. Most P&S; cameras with super zoom don't take good pictures in the long focal length zone. Besides, the max. in this Sammy is 432mm and how often you need more than this? I am glad that Sammy doesn't try to force a super zoom in this camera and degrade the overall lens quality.Has a BSI-COMS sensor which among other things takes great low-noise photos under low light (if you expose the shot right.)Only 12.5M Effective Pixel. Yes, I say \"only\" and it's a good thing. Pixel count is a number game cameras manufacturers use to sell cameras. For this size of sensor, you really don't want to over pack it with way too many pixels b/c it would increase noise. 12.5 MP is enough for most P&S; shooters - how many big posters are you going to print, right?Panorama mode that actually works very well. Real automatic sweep-and-stitch not just \"stitch assist\" like in some cameras. And it actually works great. I tested it on the street with moving cars and pedestrians and it captures everything nice and sharp w/o blurs. Haven't tried the Action Panoramic yet but it sounds very interesting.Custom controls. Most P&S; cameras don't give you much of a choice for most of the functions and settings. This Sammy gives you many choices for many of its functions and settings making it more like an more expensive bridge camera than a P&S.; I will list some of them below:****Flash Output control. Most P&S; only has options to turn the flash on, off or auto. This Sammy also let you change the amount of the flash to fine tune your shots.****White balance. Besides the many presets, you can do a custom WB yourself or \"dial in\" a specific color temp.****\"Selection\" AF. In this mode, you can move the focus area to a specific spot.****Full Manual Exposure Control. Not many P&S; cameras at this price have this.Miscellaneous.****Smart Filter and Magic Frame. Gimmicky and not really important but they are fun to play with. You can apply them either before or after taking the shots.****Simulate 3D. Not true 3D but it's kind of fun.****Take still shots during video shoots.****Can turn audio recording on or off while zooming in Video mode.****Stereo audio.Cons / Annoyance:Short charger cord. Really, the USB charging cord is way too short. I have to use an extension cord all the time.No stand-alone battery charger. They don't sell one nor does it come with one that you simply put the battery in the charger and plug the charger in the wall socket. The one that comes with the camera charges the battery when it is in the camera. They do sell one that charges the battery outside of the camera but you plug that in a computer via USB instead of a wall socket. This is just stupid. Fortunately, you can buy an after-market charger for about $20.No Orientation Sensor. So photos taken in portrait orientation will not display vertically. You can rotate it in View Mode and it saves the rotation. The operation should be lossless but I am not 100% sure. Besides, it is very annoying to have to do it one by one in the camera. I use software to do that in batch.Flash delay. Some reviewers report that the flash delays a lot. I find that while it is true for the first flash shot (up to 3 seconds), it fires immediately in subsequent shots. There is also a delay when the battery is running low but that is to be expected.No GPS. It's not a con for me but it may be for you.Conclusion:That's it folk. I think the WB750 is a great camera for the price. Actually, I think it is better than a lot of cameras twice as expensive.", "Date": "August 31, 2012"}, {"Title": "Quality pictures on full auto, even in poor light", "Author": "Michael Christofield \"michael\"", "ReviewID": "R3TO8U6G9Y3G13", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "About me:  I am not a professional photographer nor am I a highly experienced photography enthusiast.  I am an amateur, albeit one with a bit of experience and knowledge, and I've taken a couple of photography classes, developed my own film, etc.  I do not have experience with a wide number of cameras, so my score and review is not based on a comparison to other cameras, just my expectations for a relatively inexpensive point-and-shoot.The Samsung WB750 has what you would expect for more experienced photographers (full manual mode to adjust shutter speed, aperture, ISO, etc.) and a lot of nifty extras.  I'm not going to catalog all of the features since you can get that information everywhere.  Suffice it to say, though, there's a lot jam-packed into this fairly small package.What I think a lot of people are looking for, though, is the answer to this one simple question: can you take decent photos on the go in all the settings you'd expect on full auto, without having to think about anything? The answer is yes.  I've included a bunch of sample pictures, which you can find in the customer image gallery.  All but two are taken late at night, in a poorly lit room and are of the same subject: my (rather dark) couch. I laid down a colorful blanket on top and set up a few remotes against it so that you can really get a good understanding of the color quality.  All of the photos except the one with the bugs include exif data that shows you the ISO, shutter speed, aperture, lighting, etc. so you can get some idea of how different things affect the image.  Some images were taken with me holding the camera, others with the use of a tripod (I noted which were which in the captions). The only settings I adjusted were the flash (on or off, though there's a lot of customization available with how the flash is used), shutter speed, exposure time, one picture was taken using HDR, a couple others on bracket mode, and a few zoomed in.Given the wide range of settings, there are a lot of choices you could make to get a picture that's just right, but with this kind of camera (as opposed to a DSLR), I think most people are going to be using it to take pictures on the go, at a moment's notice and aren't going to want to be messing around with the settings for every picture.  For example, I have two small children.  When they are doing something cute, I need to take a picture RIGHT NOW, not in a minute after I've adjusted for lighting, etc.  Thus, it's very important to have a camera that takes good pictures on full auto.  I'd say that the best looking photo that I took of my couch is the first one, the one that was handheld, full auto, with the flash engaged.  Considering how terrible the lighting was in that room, it's a decent photo with good color reproduction.  Would it have been possible to take an even better photo using all of the various settings this camera offers?  Yes, absolutely.  However, it's not bad for a quick snapshot.Now if you did want to venture into the settings, there's a lot to choose from, and it can be a little overwhelming, given all of the choices, but once you figure out what things do, it's pretty easy to navigate the menus and select the various options you want.There are a few things I want to make special note of.  First, you can do a little editing and correcting within the camera, which is kind of nice, but ultimately it's not going to replace your photo editing software.  I would also add that it creates a copy of your photo, so you aren't losing the original if you choose to edit in-camera.Another thing I'd like to point out is the panorama option.  I absolutely love it.  My previous camera required stitching, but in this you just move the camera at a steady pace until the blue bar fills up, completing your picture.  You can see exactly what's going on, and the photos come out very nicely.This camera takes very good video.  I believe you are limited to chunks of 20 minutes for normal video, but the quality is really good - this camera will definitely work in a pinch if you don't have a high-quality camcorder.  There are also two hi-speed options.  440fps and, I think, 220fps.  These videos are limited to 10 seconds of shooting (though the actual videos end up being around 2 and a half and 1 and a half min. long), and there is no audio.  The 440fps is almost a joke.  You need exceptionally good lighting (outside in bright light) to get anything, and the video is very small and grainy.  It's not completely unusable, but don't expect a lot.  As for the 220fps, it's much better, though the video is still smaller than normal and of lower quality.  Again, you need very good, bright, outdoor lighting.  But the video is definitely usable.Yeah, you can take 3D images, but you need a 3D display to see them.  I don't have one, so I can't tell you if it's worth anything or not.With the latest firmware (Aug. 2012, I think), the camera will still use off-brand batteries, which can be had for around $3.  I ordered two different ones, and both worked fine in my camera.  Also, the camera does not come with a separate battery charger, so you have to charge the battery inside the camera.  That's stupid.  I got a cheap battery charger, and it works great.  Which is nice because this camera kind of sucks up the juice fairly quickly.  I don't think the battery life is abnormally short or anything, but it's nothing to brag about either.One thing I'm not terribly impressed by, though, is the picture processing lag time.  I have a class 10 SDHC memory card in there, and it still takes a good couple of seconds for the picture to get processed and for the camera to be ready to take another photo. Maybe that's typical for this class of camera, though.  Also, I haven't tried completely turning off the feature that shows you the image you just took, so maybe there are some things that could be done to cut down on the processing time a little.  It's not horrible, and you can use the burst features if you're really concerned about missing some stuff.  Just something to keep in mind.All in all, it's an easy and pleasant camera to use, nothing awkward about it, and it works well on full auto but has tons of features for those that want to dig into it more.  I've been very happy with my purchase so far.", "Date": "September 30, 2012"}, {"Title": "Nice camera - but make sure accessories are available", "Author": "P. Tuggle", "ReviewID": "R2KEX087OG5902", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This is a very nice, solid camera with good image quality. I cannot attest to the video quality -- seems fine to me but I have nothing to compare. The reason I purchased the camera was the 24mm wide angle capability and the relatively low price.The camera is well-built, has a good metal body with no binding or cheap parts. It has a lot of cool features for the money. I really do like the fact that you can do bracketing of exposure (your choice of how narrow or wide apart) and the panorama feature is nice; by the way, to get great resoltion on the pano, simply turn the camera sideways (the camera thinks that is up-and-down) and you will get maximum pixel height that way. The manual modes great as well.The battery life is fine, but a separate wall charger and second SLB-10A battery is always smart to purchase, too.The one thing I needed to add to my purchase is the AV cable with RCA plugs listed as an option. I would use this for viewing both live and saved photos on an analog monitor. But guess what? The cable is virtually impossible to find. By the time you read this, that may have changed (the proper Samsung part is NOT CB5MA11, nor CB08A12 as some will tell you - Tried both now and these will not fit the WB750, so the quest continues for the A/V cable). I would give 4 stars because there is no notification that the \"optional accessories\" may not be available.  But the camera itself is a terrific value.UPDATE #1:Still an AMAZING VALUE and GREAT camera! But there are a couple of omissions in the user guide ----The user manual comes a little short on instructions for manual (A-S-M)operation -- just an omission on page 45. Not explained is that to switch back and forth for shutter and aperture setting (while in manual mode, you control BOTH), you must press down on the left side of the ring (where it is labeled for flash) while one or the other controls is highlighted in blue. One other omission is that FOCUS AREA options are set (for all modes) by pressing the bottom of the ring (where it is labeled with the little Macro flower); there you will find your choices for focus area -- not just Macro settings, but all focus settings. If you have selected automatic there, then FOCUS AREA may be grayed out (unavailable) in P, A-S-M or Dual IS modes. Two mistakes in a 145 page manual is still pretty good!UPDATE #2:I have now tried two Samsung A/V cables which do not work with the WB750 -- these are CB5MA11 and CB08A12.

It, like many other cameras, struggled with pictures that contained significant variance in light and dark areas; the light areas would be washed out badly (overexposed) while the darker areas were underexposed.  This is a common problem, at least for me, with many of the pictures I take.  The other four cameras I have, and use, do a better job with overall exposure of those shots with light and dark areas, so the Samsung went down the road.

I shoot alot of outside shots as well as landscapes and the quality of the pictures is very good. I have tried the HDR mode and it works well in the darker areas.

everything1. 12 megapixel good enough for most photo taking2. 18x optical- 25mm-432mm in 35mm standards3.  Excellent HD video with lots of advanced options4.Lots of photo options for any needs,or you can go into manual mode5. The size is small & fits in a pocket easily.  This camera is the ultimate smart camera packed in a slender stylish body.I had a canon A560 for years which took good shots,but I was really wanting a powerful zoom lens,in a camera that was less bulky.I wanted a camera that I didn't need a big camera bag to lug around,but still have something with lots of features that was small in size.  This camera is incredible with the 18x optical zoom,going up to 432 mm in 35mm type terms.When Going to Alaska this was a great feature to have,and my picture clarity would come out good almost the whole time when taking photos.Also when in video mode,I could zoom in and pick up all the action up close.wether sightseeing or fishing.The great thing was I didn't need to lug around a camera bag,and could put this right back into my coat pocket.It has a HDMI port on the side of the camera so you can playback off your tv.It also has a micro usb 2.0  for transfering over your data very fast.  Picture taking with the WB750 is incredible,with having 12 megapixels I have more than plenty to make me happy.There our many different preset setttings to put this camera to cater to your needs.I really like the panoramic mode to be able to make a real creative picture wherever i am at.The closeup mode is nice as well,and you can take some real detailed shots for ebay & craigslist if your selling items also.The panoramic shot option is really nice to have & this is a feature worth using to capture that moment.  The video camera  with the WB750 is loaded with lots of features.You have HD 1080 or 720p along with the powerful zoom lens that gets you into all the action.One real nice bonus is you can take pictures,while taking a video to capture that moment.I found this a real asset when in Alaska whale watching & fishing.You can also do high speed video which a lot of point & shoot  cameras don't offer.The audio is full sound stereo & sounds excellent on playback and records very well.  Theres even a movie maker  which has different preset music & themes and you can stitch your photos & videos  together right in the camera on the go.This takes a battery type slb-10a & does not take AA batteries.I thought i would miss that,but these batteries our very small & through the web i was able to buy 2 extra as backup.On a auction site I was able to get a home AC battery pack charger for less than 10 bucks.I also bought a 32gb 30mb/s high speed  scandisk memory card,so i have more than enough room for those special moments.I really can't say enough about this camera with the very small size its loaded with so many faetures & options you'll have a  intelligent smart camera in your pocket.", "Date": "February 10, 2013"}, {"Title": "I really like this camera", "Author": "Terrell", "ReviewID": "R7YPO7KS1T8TF", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I've had the camera for about 6 months and so far its been great.

Lukas", "ReviewID": "R96ARYKX53FZ3", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I don't know if this is just my particular model, but the automatic mode does not work at all.  The only good pictures are outdoors in daylight.  Any flash picture indoors is so washed out that you can't even make out the facial features of a human subject.  Without the flash, the picture is fully dark.  I'm sure there is a way to set everything manually to overcome this, but a automatic mode is supposed to be good for taking these kinds of snapshots, and this one just doesn't work at all.  Another negative is that the shot mode menu often pops up on screen and spins around, seemingly at random, when you're in auto mode.  This makes it hard to take any picture, much less a good one.  So this basically is only good for outdoor shots on a sunny day.

But the zoom is incredibly slow and herky-jerky, not smooth at all. Really frustrating to use. While it takes mostly good pics (except in low light) there were so many times the lousy zoom made me want to trash it, that and the slow processing speed. I am a travel writer/photographer so the pics were good enough for publication but the slow zoom really made me dislike this camera.I finally got my excuse to get a new camera this week when the camera started acting up and only working sporadically, must be gremlins in it. The final straw was when a whole day's worth of pictures ended up not being recorded.

I bought a WB500 almost 2 years ago, which is still going strong. So, I know Samsung has a GOOD TRACK RECORD with me. I realize for more money one can get a more well known brand with more megapixels, and features. However, I am a \"middle of the road\" sort of a person, and simply wanted the new BSI sensor type, RELIABLE, with lots of zoom. So, instead of spending more, or simply doing without, I got this, knowing it should suffice, and so far that is the case!!!!. I HIGHLY recommend using a well padded carrying case for any digital camera, as well as treating them carefully, as ANY digital camera is fragile. Also, try to keep dust away from them, and don't leave them in freezing or hot vehicles excessively or at all. Keep the batteries charged, and they should last for years.", "Date": "April 3, 2012"}, {"Title": "Not the best but a good camera", "Author": "AL AMIN", "ReviewID": "R1FKHQHV35458A", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "The camera took nice pictures, but the smart mode takes too long to adjust the correct settings, Programmed mode (Aperture priority or expose priority takes good images when the settings are correct). The 1080p video[if you do not use zoom] is outstanding. The 18x zoom is good to have, however while taking video the zooming in and out will create blurry video for significant time. The Battery will discharge at a very higher rate while taking video. During second use, the camera flash died, therefore I had returned it,it was bought from Adoroma and they do not cover the return shipping. Additionally while I inquired about my return they told me they won't be able to exchange it and because it is more than 30 days (45 days in hand and used barely )However, they may return the defective camera back to me. I have submitted a claim to amazon to handle this issue and kept my finger crossed. Amazon never disappointed me before, therefore I hope they will handle this issue smoothly. If you decided to buy the camera, please do not buy it from Adoroma, in fact do not buy anything from Adoroma as their return policy sucks. I hope my advice will help you to avoid unwanted situation.Update: I did get my money back through A-Z claim. Thanks a lot to Amazon. Before buying anything from adoroma make sure the return shipping is covered in case you have trouble.", "Date": "July 10, 2012"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": null, "Features": null, "Name": null, "ImgURL": null, "ProductID": "B005IQGUMI"}}
