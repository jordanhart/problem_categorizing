{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Excellent advanced Point and Shoot!", "Author": "BenRias", "ReviewID": "RSHT3AGM9EBQ7", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Please note that for a point and shoot, this camera deserves a 5-star review.  But in fairness to certain small details, and Amazon's inability to allow users to give partial stars (e.g. 4.75 stars), I will have to settle for 4-stars.Cosmetic PROS: Unlike some of the SD and Elph cameras in the past, this one feels solid.  Canon even improved, to some extent, the flimsy-feeling battery door.  It is a HUGE improvement over the previous flimsy plastic doors on earlier models.  The large 3\"x1\" screen is sharp and beautiful and gives an accurate depiction of what your camera will capture. Switching between full program mode and full automatic is a simple slide button on the top of the camera allowing an advanced user and a novice to both have their options easily.  This also prevents any accidental mode changes that can happen with setting-wheels or external buttons.Cosmetic CONS: The lens cover seems a touch too loose, at least on my specific camera.  It rattles and moves slightly when handling the camera after the power is off and the cover is closed.  Not a deal breaker by any stretch of the imagination, but you might notice this rattle too.  The card slot, at least on my specific camera, is strangely snug.  When I slide the card into place, there is some friction that made me question whether I was forcing it into the slot in the wrong direction.  I pushed the card in until it clicked into place, but then it did not rebound like normal (like when clicking the top of a retracting ball-point pen.)  Again, it may just be my specific camera.  (Edit: I forgot to mention that while the battery door is now more durable, the A/V door feels very flimsy. It doesn't swing out like a door.  Rather, like the cap on a tupperware drinking bottle lid, the door detaches from the camera but remains linked to it via a moderately flexible piece of plastic. And because the door snaps firmly in place when closed, you really need fingernails to get any sort of leverage to open it.  For what its worth, if I had to choose only one, I still much prefer the more durable battery door than a durable A/V door.)(Edit: Also, while I love the huge screen, please note that if you wear polarized sunglasses, you may have issues shooting on a sunny day with the screen appearing to disappear. This is more of a problem of the polarized lenses than the camera, but its worth noting.)Touch screen: Personally, I prefer standard buttons.  However, this touch screen is fine.  It is big enough that my fingers are able to select menu items easily.  For those of you coming from touch screen cell phones, you may find this screen less sensitive than your phone, thus requiring you to apply more finger pressure than you are used to.  This isn't a flaw in my mind, but I can see where others may think the screen is being non-responsive.  The lanyard comes with a tightening slide.  And this slide also has a fine point on it to help you make selections on the touch screen if you are having problems--similar to the stylus of the old palm pilots.  Hard to use if your hand is in the lanyard, but hey, its a start!Features: My main reasons for purchasing this camera was to get aperture priority, shutter priority, and a macro setting as options.  Unlike the Canon's S95 with an external ring control, the aperture settings on the 500HS are buried in the touch screen menus.  That is fine for my uses and will be fairly intuitive to previous Canon users.  The f2.0 aperture setting DELIVERS!  For those wanting shallow depth of fields on their point and shoot...wow!  I loved this!  I haven't had any problems (yet) with the camera focusing on the wrong subject even in macro setting.  And because this comes with Focus Lock, you will probably be able to work around that problem if it ever arises.  Strangely, but not a deal breaker, the camera doesn't seem to have a BULB setting for shutter speed and maxes out at 15\".  I don't use that setting and speeds enough to warrant complaint, and maybe there are slower shutter speeds and I just missed them, but I figured I would share that tidbit with others who may be needing those speeds. It is just odd considering my old-old Canon SD630 had bulb setting and I think 2 minutes (but its been so long, I may be mistaken.)(edit: Just realized that this camera doesn't have exposure bracketing (where it takes three automatic shots with different exposures.)  It still has exposure adjustment allowing you to +/- exposure stops, but I am a little surprised to not find this previously included feature.  There is something called Best Image where the camera takes 5 continuous shots but automatically keeps only the best shot, but this seems to be geared toward facial expressions/blinks/etc. and not exposures.  The lack of bracketing is only a minor drawback for me--heck, its taken me a couple of weeks to realize its not present--but its worth mentioning.)Video: Because I didn't buy this for video, I cannot well judge its abilities.  I will only say that the few test videos I took were sharp, with decent sound.  However, the volume of the voice of the person holding the camera will be noticeably less.  Whether thats a good thing or bad is up to you.  Note too that the video is recorded in stereo sound.  But I can't gauge its quality. (edit: Having tested the video out more, the sound from the person recording the video (i.e. behind the camera) is actually much better than I originally thought.  Apparently, I had the volume turned down too low.  But once I adjusted the setting, the sound was rather clear and crisp. I was very impressed.)Review pics: Everything on this camera is on the touch screen EXCEPT for the review button.  The lone, solitary button on the rear of the camera is dedicated to allowing you review your shots in one touch. After hitting the review button, you can either slide your finger across the screen, tap an arrow on the side of the screen, or even BUMP the side of the camera with your finger to see the next shot! There is also a motion detector or internal accelerometer of some sort that allows you to quickly scan through your review pics by tilting the camera slightly on its side.  Those last two features are very reminiscent of smartphone technology and makes the camera feel that much more advanced than others. (edit: After more use, I *really* need to emphasize that I like the bump feature! It makes reviewing a bunch of pics really very easy!)Compared to S95, the 500HS is in the lead in my opinion.  The S95 was supposed to be the intermediate step between point and shoot cameras and DSLRs, giving some advanced features without the expense of the DSLRs.  The 500 HS is $100-$150 cheaper, more compact, and has a ton of settings and features--yes, it does have miniature model shooting mode and 1080p HD video. I think this camera is the new intermediate step to the DSLR.  To give you more perspective, my other option to fit my needs would be either a DSLR Rebel or D50 or D60...$500 at absolute minimum for the body, plus another $299 for a macro lens.  In other words, $800 minimum to get me the features I needed. Compare that to the 500 HS at $299! BARGAIN!Now, I haven't had time, yet, to see if the image stabilization and low light settings are better than in cameras past--especially since I normally have \"IS\" turned off.  So if those features are important to you, maybe visit a camera store and see the camera in person.  But since the release of this camera was supposed to be March (if I am not mistaken) and since the earthquake hit Japan in March, you may have a heck of a time finding this camera in stock anywhere.  I know there are a few pink colored models for sale.  And I completely lucked out with finding this silver model, but keep trying! It seems that a few more stores that I frequented started getting these cameras trickling in over the past 10 days.  But they seemed to be getting only 2 or 3 cameras at a time.Good luck!", "Date": "April 26, 2011"}, {"Title": "LOVE my new camera!", "Author": "Jill", "ReviewID": "R2BR320H55L0Y2", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I love this camera! I wanted a higher end point and shoot camera that could keep up with my kids and do well in low light. I read a lot of reviews and settled on this one. I thought about the ELPH 300hs but decided I was too used to using the touch screen on my Sony Cybershot to go back to buttons. I love the touch screen! The menus are well laid out and it is easy to find things. I was a little worried it would take me awhile to figure out the Canon menus since I have been a Sony user for so long, but I am not having any trouble at all! I am having fun trying out all of the programs/effects on the camera. The Kids and Pets setting is just what I was looking for. My kids don't sit still for me to take pictures and now I can just snap pictures of them on the go without the picture being too blurry. After reading reviews I was worried about battery life. I decided to buy and extra battery since we had a big wedding we were going to and I didn't want my camera to die before the day was done. Turns out I wouldn't have needed the extra battery. I still have the first battery in after taking 150 pictures and a few short videos. Another thing I love is that there isn't much delay between pressing the button and the actual capturing of the picture (this was a big frustration with my previous camera). The only thing I noticed is that with moving subjects and in low light you really have to make sure to give the camera time to focus by holding the button halfway down for a second or two before snapping the picture. I had great luck with this camera in low light. I snapped some really awesome pictures on the dance floor at the wedding. I was even able to shoot a little video on the dance floor. When I tried that with my old camera it turned out almost black, but with this camera I got a great video of my 3 year old dancing. I have only had this camera for a week, but I haven't found any area where this camera has let me down yet. I am excited to keep experimenting with some of the programs and effects I haven't gotten to use yet. Bottom line....Great camera!UPDATE: I lost my ELPH 500 HS while we were on vacation (a long sad story). I needed a new camera fast so I went to Best Buy and they only had the ELPH 300 HS and nothing else was really close to the quality I wanted at the price I wanted so I bought it. The 300 has pretty much the same functions as the 500 and still takes great pictures. But I would take my 500 back any day! The touch screen makes it so much simpler to navigate through the menus and change settings quickly. I don't think the microphone is as good on the 300 because a couple of my videos are hard to hear. It seems a little slower to focus and snap a picture, but maybe it is all in my head. One problem I noticed is that my photo editing software (I use Picasa) would automatically pick up the red eye on photos with my 500 but on the 300 I have to manually select the area to change it. The 300 looks cooler than the 500 and is a little smaller, but I loved the large screen on the 500 and you don't get that with the 300 since they had to make room for all the buttons. Bottom line in my opinion: Spend the extra $70 and go for the 500 - it is worth it.", "Date": "August 1, 2011"}, {"Title": "Beautiful Pictures...Easy to use touch screen", "Author": "PKA \"pka\"", "ReviewID": "R34HJOTKD1VXK6", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "The provided pictures I uploaded to Amazon show you how great this camera is.  These shots where within the first 10 minutes of running the camera and shot in full auto mode.  Color is great and clarity is super.  I felt all Nikons in the price range had color issues and the Sonys looked dark and muddy.  It was between this and the SX230 but for me it came down to this:1: 500HS has a 2.0 f stop which means it will preform better in low light than the SX230 (f/3.1)2: 500HS has better macro at 3cm vs 5cm for those extreme close ups3. 500HS shoots 3.4fps vs 0.8 in the SX2304. SX230 has a GPS which I could careless about.  What is the point of this?  We have survived for years without it.  Why all of a sudden is this important?5. SX230 has great zoom but clarity and light is lost the farther you zoom so its not really a benefit to me.The SX230 is a great camera but the above mentioned which directly affects picture quality pushed me to the 500HS.  Good luck in your search but I am very pleased with this camera.  The touch screen is very nice and I actually had no problem switching over from standard dials.  Though it may slow you down in between shots I find the menus well thought out and very easy to navigate.I haven't gotten into manual controls yet but can only imagine it will get better.

A myriad of features that put my Canon 450D in the shade, quite frankly. I've been waiting for all these features in a pocket camera, and Canon have done it, and managed to organize the display so it is so easy to get to where you want and pick out whatever parameters you are looking for. Do I love this camera? Yes, I love it and cannot find fault with it in any way. A great camera to own that will leave all your other cameras in their cases. You only need this one.I would only recommend they think about putting a collapsible, removable metal shade (based on 2-1/4 camera viewfinder technology) on the back of the camera, because even with the display at full luminosity, in bright sunlight, it's difficult to compose a shot since it doesn't have viewfinder.Paul Olsen[...][...]", "Date": "June 12, 2011"}, {"Title": "A Fun Camera", "Author": "The Garage \"Dave\"", "ReviewID": "R263E3JRDR8EDE", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "The ELPH 500 HS is easy and fun to use and takes great pictures in automatic and program modes.  The special effects are great.  The touch screen menus are easy to follow and you can customize them to suit your needs.  The large LCD screen is terrific.I was on the fence about a touch screen camera but I'm glad I bought this one.  It's easy to use but not as fast or sensitive as a smart phone.  That's bad if you like your smart phone but good because it makes it hard to accidentally change a setting.  The screen doesn't seem to pick up finger prints as fast as a smart phone either.I also wasn't sure about not having a view finder.  With the screen on this camera I can't imagine ever using a view finder, even in bright sun.  Not an issue for me.My only caution is to always, always, always use the wrist strap with this camera especially at first.

A rough criteria of what I was looking for is as follows:- Sharp and vivid 1080p video quality- Good stereo recording quality when shooting video- Great picture quality (including low-light conditions)- Excellent macro ability- Touch screen (for more control over auto-focusing)I'm happy to say that once I received the 500 HS, it met every one of my expectations and exceeded them. The camera is compact and light enough so that carrying it with me everyday is a pleasure.The picture quality is unmatched in this size and price category. Even though the 500 HS has a small (standard 1/2.3\" back-illuminated CMOS) sensor, the picture quality produced approaches that of larger sensor point-and-shoots, like the S95. Artifacts are virtually non-existent, and only appear in very very low-light scenarios or zoomed pictures, as expected. The 500 HS has an auto mode that is very suitable in most situations and produces beautifully composed pictures, but the camera also has available manual settings in \"P\" mode if you want more control. Also, it takes the 500 HS a mere 2 seconds to start up and be ready for the first shot. The response time between shots is also very quick.The 1080p video quality is also very nice. There was no visible lag when playing back video that included fast panning and fast moving objects. The sound captures all of the sounds too, without including too much of unwanted ambient noise. The camera also auto-focuses and has the ability to zoom during video capture.The features included will pretty much overwhelm any user. I will skip out on describing each in detail, as every mode can be found online. But I will point out that the only thing the 500 HS is \"lacking\" is an automated panorama mode that seems to be so popular recently. Though, panorama mode is something that I wasn't really looking for or needing, as I believe if I were to want to take a panorama picture, I might as well be taking a Full HD video anyway.The touch screen is phenomenal. It covers the entire backside of the camera, and the only physical button on the backside is the playback button, located on the bottom right. This large 460K-dot 3.2\" screen provides you with a sharp and clear view of all of your pictures/videos. At times, when your hands are excessively wet or oily, the touchscreen might not respond as well as you'd like, but the rest of the time, the touchscreen handles perfectly. The best part of a touchscreen camera, as I mentioned earlier, is that it gives you the option to bias focus towards a certain object/area on-screen. You just tap your finger on whatever you want to bias the focus towards, and it will track/auto-focus according to where you've touched on-screen. This is something that most non-touchscreen cameras can't do, unless it has manual focus like the S95, which adds extra bulk. So I find that the touchscreen focus is a good compromise between those 2 extremes. It is lightweight, though can focus accurately when you need it to be.I also love the wide-angle lens that the 500 HS provides. Macro shots come out stunningly composed, and rival those produced by entry-level DSLR's.So if you're in the market for a decently priced, high-end, compact point-and-shoot jammed full of features, I would whole-heartedly recommend the 500 HS to you (also known as the IXUS 310 overseas).", "Date": "August 12, 2011"}, {"Title": "Best Low Light point and shoot camera you can buy", "Author": "ccc", "ReviewID": "R3SD0AW9P4U365", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I liked my first purchase so well, I bought another for my wife.

The camera is a true point & shoot camera, as I am not an expert photographer. I chose wide screen pictures, they are great! Also the screen is so big you can see how well the picture turns out in an instant. No guesswork here.  The videos were excellent. Again, in widescreen & whether 1080p or 720p, the videos capture a clear picture and there is enough zoom to pull in the subject on the go without getting the picture jitters. The videos capture excellent sound. I was in a room with a very loud stereo system. I wondered if the sound would be distorted. Nope, the sound was perfect in stereo as well.  Only advice to give is it's nice to have 2 extra batteries on hand if you are out all day. They don't cost much and charge up in under 2 hrs.

While I would have loved something in the category of a Canon S95 or S100, they are really so significantly out of my price range that they were out of the question as a second camera. The Nikon P300 was closer on price, and had a couple extra features the Elph 500 HS lacked, but for the money, the Elph 500 HS seemed to give me most of what I wanted so I thought I'd give it a try.Physically I love this camera. It feels solidly built. The brown color is a nice change from silver/black and it still looks like a serious camera. I like that there's a separate button for image review, which only warrants its separate button status because it also acts as a power button; if you press it while the power is off it turns on for image review but doesn't extend the lens. The camera is pretty heavy for its size; I don't mind it, but it's a bit too thick and heavy to carry in a shirt pocket. The one dislike I have about the controls is the zoom control which is a little small.Of course the main feature of this camera is the touch screen. I'm not a big fan of touch screens since physical buttons can often be operated by feel while you of course have to look closely at a touch screen to use it. I was a little bit concerned about how good this one would be, and I have to say I was pleasantly surprised. The screen is responsive enough as far as pressing buttons is concerned. Any operations that involve dragging your finger across the screen I find a little frustrating. But overall, the enhanced capabilities offered by the touch screen (such as touch focusing, being able to quickly select an image to view, and being able to reassign virtual buttons) really outweigh the occasional menu annoyance. The little mini-stylus provided on the wrist strap might be helpful to some but I don't use it.I am pretty happy with the low-light performance, which was one of the key features for me since I'm not a fan of indoor flash. Between all the various features of the camera, I can get away without a flash more often than I can on my DSLR, which is good because the Elph's lens partially blocks the flash at close distances. I really love the image stabilization. It makes a HUGE difference for both stills and video. There is even a slow-sync flash to help with those low-light flash exposures, so you can expose both the subject and background properly as well as employ some creative techniques. Some of the low-light (or high-speed) modes are rather gimmicky in my opinion because they reduce the resolution to 3MP but in some cases you don't care.I was looking for some amount of manual control. The Elph 500 has a (relatively narrow) exposure override, aperture priority and shutter priority modes, but few options for available shutter speeds and apertures, so it's somewhat limited in flexibility, and without a physical controls (like a jog wheel or dial) it can be a little tedious to select your settings. I also find the 15-sec max exposure time to be a bit arbitrary and limiting. I guess I can understand the lack of 'bulb' setting since there's no remote shutter release. There is no manual focus other than locking the focus on infinity, but touch focusing, possibly assisted by AF lock, mostly replaces manual focus.Auto mode takes some getting used to. I think people expect a failproof 'auto' mode, but the reality is that cameras do not necessarily always make the same decisions a photographer would make. This is why the manual modes are handy to have, and I think in a lot of cases it's also why people can be disappointed in how their pictures turn out if they shoot in full auto. It is possible, for example, for the camera to choose a focus point that you wouldn't choose, but that's why it SHOWS you what it's focused on, it can show you a zoomed-in closeup of that area, and you can override the camera's choice if you want. Another example - auto white balance can result in changing white balance across a series of shots if lighting conditions change slightly. Full auto often results in a great picture, just not always! Basically I would suggest it takes some practice to learn how to make the camera take the shot you want, even in full auto.Some really great time-saving features: I love the ability to scroll through pictures by tapping on the side of the camera, so that you can keep your fingers away from the screen. I like being able to put some particular often-used functions (like ISO setting) in unused 'button' spaces on the touch screen. Blink detection actually turns out to be pretty handy, quicker than trying to look closely at faces yourself after you take every shot. The battery charges quickly (but of course it runs down quickly too). Power-on delay is short, zooming is quick, and focusing is reasonably fast.Some things I don't really care for: as many have said, the door covering the USB and other ports is horrible, but I personally don't use those ports, preferring to pop the card out and transfer everything to my computer, rather than print directly from the camera (which works great though), plug the camera into the computer, or view images/movies directly on my tv. Some of the shooting modes are not really that useful, either because they reduce the resolution to accomplish them, they don't work particularly well, or they are special effects that would be better applied in post-processing rather than a permanent part of your shot, but I guess they're there for people who do not want to have to do any post-processing. The super-slow-mo movies are rather gimmicky and the quality is really ragged but my kids LOVE watching themselves be silly in slow motion.Overall I think it was a good choice. I personally wouldn't want this as my ONLY camera, and it's probably a bit of overkill for a really casual photographer for whom a $100 model would do fine, but it works great and fits my needs perfectly.", "Date": "March 6, 2012"}, {"Title": "Great Camera", "Author": "Avid Amazon \"SciFI Reader\"", "ReviewID": "R96EQGMVMMIRT", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I am casual user and this camera fits the bill.

I normally use an SLR (Canon 7D). I purchased this one as a small camera to take on outings. I end up taking a lot of video and very few still shots because the still photos just are not coming out.

After using it for a few weeks I have come to love it. I actually look forward to manually configuring white balance, exposure and ISO because the touch screen interface is fun to use.

My favorite feature is that you can configure the screen to show icons for your favorite tasks, such as white balance, which I use all the time. I'm happy that so many people hated the touch screen because it seems like the negative publicly drove the price of this camera down prematurely, which netted me a hefty savings.The difference switching from my old digital elph's physical buttons compared to this camera is similar to when I traded in my old blackberry for an iphone. Night and day.My only complaint:I love the 24mm wide angle zoom but I wish the default zoom level could be adjusted. The problem is that when the camera is first turned on, the lens defaults to 24mm. Most of the pictures I take tend to be the typical closeups of people. Wide angle is not a good option for these types of pictures because it creates distortion and other problems. I wish I could set it to default to 35mm instead. For now I have to zoom in a little every time I turn the camera on for a photo.

I am just a Father who wanted to buy a decent camera for taking family photos of my boys and wife.I spent the last two months looking for a camera to buy that would produce \"high quality\" pictures of my family. I first wanted a dslr and I was ready to pay the premium price for it. Since I mostly use my camera on auto settings and have read you will not get a much better shot with a dslr on auto than a p&s;, I decided to save some money and go with something cheaper. I have looked at every bridge camera and high end p&s; that you can imagine. The next thing I considered was the functions on the camera. I was going to buy the Canon s100, but decided to save some money since I was not going to be using the RAW function for pictures. I don't do post processing, so I wanted the best picture possible out of my camera. Now keep in mind, I am coming from a fujifilm camera that is just over a year old, a basic p&s.; The old camera produced okay results, but they were not what I wanted.So after spending hours upon hours on photography message boards, I came across a post that recommended this camera as it has a fast f 2.0 lens. After doing some searching, it appeared to be the only one in this price range with this fast of a lens. The f2.0 let's a lot more light in, so when I used to have to use the flash with my old camera, I don't have to now with my elph 500.Now onto the actual review of the camera, to sum it up, IT IS AWESOME! The high sensitivity sensor with this lens takes pictures that are so crisp. It's really a step up in terms of picture quality from my old point and shoot. It feels solid and well made. The touchscreen function will take some getting used to, but overall it's easy to use. There is a little switch on top of the camera that you lets you choose between auto and program. There are so many features under program that can still let you be in control. The flash is powerful and really brightens up pictures if needed. One word of advice if you are taking pictures of babies. This camera has a little red autofocus light that comes on when the flash is needed. For my baby, he doesn't like it and will look away. You can turn off that feature in the settings if you find your child does not like the light either. The 1080p video on this is also awesome and is much better in low light that my dedicated 1080p video camera. The footage is less grainy on the Canon which really surprised me.In conclusion, I would highly recommend this camera to anyone that wants very high image quality with ease of use(auto mode) without spending a lot of money. It's definitely worth the price!", "Date": "February 4, 2013"}, {"Title": "Canon quality not what it used to be: lens cover stuck 1 month past warranty", "Author": "Anya", "ReviewID": "R15WGB47ZVMOOC", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "This is my last Canon purchase. I'd had their SD20 digital camera since 2005, and it STILL works great. I wanted a pocket camera that would do better in low light, and after a pile of research, chose the Powershot Elph 500. It was $200 when I bought it, and the camera was bulkier than I'd have liked but took great photos, so ok, all good. Then, after less than a year of normal use, the lens cover started sticking. So now, EVERY time I turned the camera on, I had to manually flick the lens cover open. I tried cleaning it, tried just living with it, but eventually I pretty much hated using this camera, but it was 12 and a half months since the purchase date, and Canon told me I could pay to ship it to their repair facility, but since the warranty was up, it'd likely be $189 to repair it since it's past the 1 year warranty. Never ever ever buying Canon again. Ever.Update:I paid $15 to ship the camera to Canon's repair address telling them that I would not pay for repair but felt this had been an unreasonable lifespan for the camera, and I wanted either a free repair or a replacement. I don't think they cared about my opinion, but they sent me a replacement refurbished camera saying they didn't repair this model of their cameras. So, I guess this is a good outcome, though really, after less than a year of careful use of a brand new camera, it required a $15 shipping for repair, and I ended up with a refurbished product. I still feel disappointed with Canon, and I'll still be looking at a different brand when it comes time for my next camera purchase. The old SD20 is still going strong -- I wish their new products were as solid.Update 2:Within months, the refurb camera had the EXACT SAME issue -- lens cover sticks every time the camera is turned on.

I bought the first one about a year ago and it takes such excellent indoor pictures that I bought a second one as a backup in case they become unavailable.After a through evaluation of the first 500HS, I discovered that it could take less sharp pictures when shooting in Auto mode.  But by just flipping the switch from Auto mode to the camera icon (P-Mode), this camera always takes sharp pictures.  Don't worry, shooting in P-Mode is exactly like shooting in Auto mode where you can just point & shoot with full auto everything.  I did find that the default setting for the 500HS tends to overexpose slightly so I set it's exposure compensation to -1/3 for both outdoor and indoor pictures and the exposures are perfect.  You only have to do this once and the camera remembers it even when you power it off or remove the battery for charging.  Exposure compensation cannot be set in Auto mode so that's another good reason to set the camera to P-Mode.The lens on this camera is exceptional with a F2.0 aperature when not zoomed, which lets in a LOT of light for exceptionally good low light indoor images.  Compare to the usual F3.3 aperature on most other compact point & shoot cameras which does not let in as much light.  Plus this camera uses a BSI (Back Side Illuminated) CMOS sensor to capture the image which is a later technology to capture more light and therefore have less noise in low light images.  The combination of the F2.0 aperature and the BSI CMOS sensor results in exceptional low light indoor image quality.  I bought 3 other compact P&S; cameras prior to buying the Elph 500HS, and returned all 3 because they took such poor low light indoor images.  They all had enough noise in low light images that the cameras did excessive noise reduction which made their low light images have a smeary water color look.  The low light images from this Elph 500HS has substantially less noise so Canon did not have to do excessive noise reduction on the images.  This results in natural looking and SHARP indoor images. --- Any camera can take good outdoor images but the true test is noise free, sharp indoor images.Folks who buy a compact point & shoot camera like this Elph 500HS don't normally want to fool with manual controls.  But the 500HS does have Aperature and Shutter priority modes for folks who do like to control those parameters.  This camera uses a touch screen which reviewers find not as good as an iPhone, but shooters who buy this camera don't want to fool with controls anyway.  Actually, the touch screen is better when selecting images to playback.  Just flick the zoom ring to the left to display small thumbnails (more presses = smaller thumbnails) and then touch the image you want to display on the screen.  This is much easier than using navigation buttons to select an image for playback.To record video, when you're taking pictures, there's a small red icon on the screen.  Just touch that red record icon and the camera starts recording video.  Then touch the red stop icon and the video recording stops.  Couldn't be simpler.Finally, this camera has a forward facing flash that doesn't pop up out of the camera.  My wife would hate having a flash pop up under her finger when shooting indoors.  Plus that would force her to hold the camera a little differently which she wouldn't want to do.My wife and I both love this camera.", "Date": "January 20, 2013"}, {"Title": "LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE", "Author": "Mary Contrary", "ReviewID": "R2OVLH5LJ41SUM", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I'm an amatuer photographer and I was tired of lugging my \"big\" DSLR camera around.

When the last one had a big scratch on the lends, I replaced it with the comparable 500HS. The 500HS is a huge disappointment. First off, the lens cover gets stuck every time I turn on the camera. I have to flick the cover to completely open it with my fingernail or something so I don't get fingerprints on the lens. When I forget, 2 corners of my photo have black spots from being covered. The macro isn't great. My previous PowerShot took AMAZING macro shots. I can try to focus the 500HS over and over and 80% of the time, it doesn't focus clearly on the object, and even when it does, it's nothing compared to the clarity of previous PowerShots. The colors are washed out in the pictures. Often it's overexposed, and when it isn't, the color is flat. It's so hard to get the exposure correct. I end up having to enhance every picture to help with the exposure and color saturation. I've used it extensively for 10 months and hate it. I may end up replacing it prematurely because I just can't get satisfactory photos out of it. From a usability standpoint, I can't stand the touch screen, it's slow and not always intuitive.

A great camera in its day, but bulky and I found myself not wanting to carry it.  Plus it was getting harder to upload pictures. So I began a search for a new pocket camera.  My primary criteria was excellent low light performance.  I work in theater, backstage in the dark, and occasionally want to capture what life in blue light looks like.  I also never use a flash, no matter the situation. So the CMOS sensor in the Elph 500 appealed to me.  I also considered every other Elph: the 100, 300, and 310 HS. Those models are great, but so small! I'm a tactile person and how something feels is important to me. I'd not considered this camera till it went on sale as a lightning deal, and I decided to take a chance.  I'm glad I did! The ELPH 500 HS feels substantial for its small size. The beveled edge makes it easy to hold.  Most importantly, it takes great pictures! I tested it in low light and got excellent results. The mode that's most useful is Handheld Night scene.  If you set the camera in automatic, in low light situations, it'll often choose that.  How smart! You can trust the camera in the Automatic setting.  I also like the menu navigation.  I was able to mute the camera with no difficulty after reading the Quick Start guide. I really enjoy the touch screen interface. It's not like an iPhone, but the result is that you won't make accidental inputs. When you choose something you have to mean it! Tap with intention. The only con so far is minor: the lens cover is loose when closed. That concerned me. I checked the display model at another store and it was the same: loose.  But it doesn't affect the performance.  PROS:  -Excellent performance in low light  -good build quality  -Fast start up  -Easy to import photos. I use iPhoto  -I enjoy the touch screen navigation  -Takes beautiful video  CONS:  -Loose lens coverSo far I love this camera!

Excellent Video clips in rooms like studios, night clubs, or stage events with incandescent light. Much better performance than the newer ELPH 510 and 520 models.

Small button must be really pressed and held down to switch on, and wont get pressed by mistake when camera is in my travel case, backpack, or back pocket. (I say this because the Panasonic I bought has a slide on-off switch that always turns on my mistake when the camera is in my backpack, and my battery is drained when I arrive. Very Annoying.CONS:1. Fragile Lens Barrel -plastic and easy to break. I dropped the camera on the rug while lens was out, and it jammed and broke the lens barrel. Repair cost more than the camera. Had to buy another one.2. Fragile leaf lens cover. Camera was in my back pocket in a soft case. I sat on the camera and bent the leaves on the lens cover. Cover sticks opening and closing. This is a common complaint and many owners have dumped the camera as used on ebay because of this issue, but easy to fix yourself. Carefully take off the leaf ring, remove the leaves, press on the leaves on a flat surface to flatten them again, re-attach the springs to the leaves, press the cover back on, good as new. A camera repair shop can do this but charges a lot of money.3. Low light photos are a little grainy. Disappointed for a 12 megapixel camera, but mainly I bought the camera for low light video clips, not for low light photos.In spite of the cons, this is a MUST HAVE pocket camera for short video clips and vacation travel. Videos are rich color and clear in low light. Sad that Canon discontinued the 500 model. I broke another one and amazon is running out of them.

Because I'm a gadget fan and since touch-screen cameras have been hitting the market for the past couple of years, I wanted to give one of them a try.  I like the touch screen because (1) the back of the camera has more area for the screen and (2) I really like doing away with the mechanical buttons and switches.  The Canon 500 HS has many of the same features as most other P&S; cameras.  I especially like the face-detection and \"wink\" technology for taking photos using the timer.  The touch screen does take some practice to get used to.  It's not as touch responsive as I had expected and scrolling thru the menus can be a bit jumpy.  Perhaps I have been spoiled by my iPhone touch screen.  The picture quality of the Canon is pretty good but like all digital cameras, you get the best picture quality when using the lowest ISO setting possible.  Overall, I am pleased with this camera and I would purchase it again.  The small size and weight of this ELPH camera is also appealing since it easily fits in my shirt or pants pocket.

I love that rig, but it's not always practical when I take the dog on a hike or I travel by plane. So I was in the market for a decent P&S; with higher ISO performance than you typically find in the P&S; world. So far this camera delivers. It has pretty good low-light performance for such a small unit. Noise at ISO400 indoors produces decent pictures with pretty low noise levels. It's not DSLR-quality, but it's better than my last P&S; - a Panasonic Lumix FZ8. The touch-screen isn't taking all that much to get used to. I was a bit leery of that feature. But after an hour or so of playing with the camera I can get around pretty good. I bought this one over the 300 as I wanted some manual control over the settings and this model has Aperture and Shutter priority modes. Auto mode seems good too. I played around with some of the scene modes and they work as advertised.This is a very small P&S; and performs really well for the size and price-point. If I didn't buy this camera I would have bought a S-95. This was $114 cheaper than the S-95 at the time I bought. And the way things are these days it's prudent to spend less (IMO). Very pleased with my purchase.Edited to add:Boot-up time is pretty fast. Around 3 seconds. I can snap a picture as soon as the LCD goes live though. Shutter lag is minimal.

Simply touch the screen while your video is playing and while on pause , several icons will appear ,  including the volume control for playback on the camera.  This is not clearly indicated by Canon, but is a tremendous help when playing back on the unit. The Elph 500 is heavy, uses a battery that lasts longer than other camera's in the running .  The 2.0 f stop and movie zoom (using the toggle button) makes for great videos as well as stills.

The brown version is very attractive with a metallic lens barrel and a chocolate brown colored body.  The camera is very small and light and will easily slip into a coat pocket or a small case.  The front of the camera is done in metal, while the rest is plastic.  Still, it's very nicely made and feels solid in the hands.  The only part that feels a bit cheap is the plastic touch screen on the back.  Compared to an iPhone's glass screen it feels low rent.  On the plus side, the tripod socket is metal.In use the 500 HS ranges from fully automated, to almost completely manual.  To change settings you simple flip the switch on the top of the camera.  In automatic mode the camera does all the thinking for you, however, if you want more control you can switch to program mode or one of the many scene and special shooting modes.  One really unexpected and nice feature is the shutter and aperture priority modes.  Very rarely will a camera in this class have these modes, and for the experienced photographer, or those wanting to learn more about photography, these modes are a real plus.  The range for the shutter speeds is 1/1000\" - 15\", while the apertures range from f/2.0 to f/8.0.Speed wise the Canon 500 HS is very quick to turn on, focus, and take the next photo.  The camera will not slow you down.  It focuses quickly and accurately even in low light on the telephoto end of the zoom, taking about 1\" to lock focus.  Switching from playback to picture taking is also quick.  When in playback mode one neat feature is being able to tap the sides of the camera to move back and forth through the photos.Changing settings on the camera is mostly smooth and simple, however the touch screen is not nearly as responsive as an iPhone.  Especially frustrating is trying to negotiate the scrolling menus.  More often than not I overshoot my selection.  Quite honestly I prefer my cameras with buttons, but as far as touch screens are concerned this one is not too bad.  Once you get used to it, you shouldn't have any problems.Photo quality on the 500 HS is very high.  Not only does the camera have an image stabilizer in the lens (which allows for handheld shooting in low light), but it also has an f/2.0 lens at wide angle.  This is a great feature as it lets in a lot more light than cameras that start at f/2.8 (basically the lower the f/ number the more light the camera can collect).  When you combine the bright lens, image stabilizer, and good quality sensor you've got a great camera for taking photos without the flash or when light levels drop.  The 12-megapixel sensor takes images that look good all the way up to ISO 800, and even the highest setting, ISO 3200, can be used in a pinch.  At low ISO speeds the camera takes in a lot of detail and the lens is sharp from corner to corner, even wide open.  Exposure and sharpness are great, however, colors can seem a bit dull at times, especially under florescent lights.Movie quality is also high and taken in high definition with stereo sound.  You can use the optical zoom while filming, and there is a dedicated movie button on the top right hand side of the screen.Battery life is great and I was able to take a few hundred photos with lots of reviewing and a bit of zooming before the battery died.All in all... a really great bargain and a very capable camera.", "Date": "December 17, 2012"}, {"Title": "Another great product from Canon", "Author": "Michael Spottiswoode \"mspot\"", "ReviewID": "R20WWT1ADRANH4", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "So far I haven't used it much but, from my experience so far, it looks like it's another great little product from Canon.", "Date": "November 27, 2012"}, {"Title": "Great buy", "Author": "Darrell", "ReviewID": "R2088NEZLUI3A2", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Love this camera.

So I'll skip the technical stuff. I do however; do my research before I buy ANYTHING. I have always owed cannon digital cameras since the early versions of the elph series. I've held on to those way past the boom in megapixels believing more doesn't necessarily mean better. However, since my friend is constantly shooting high quality photos with a Sony Cybershot. I thought it was time to upgrade. (That and my zoom finally broke and was not worth fixing on my SD320)Having an aesthetically and functionally well designed camera is important to me. I really like the weight of this camera. If you want a camera you can slip in your pocket and forget it's there...this isn't it. It's puffed out a bit more that some point and shoots.  And because all its edges are rounded off it's less boxy and yet more aerodynamic looking which feels somehow more sleek and manageable to me. To be picky they could have separated the On/Off button,Trigger button, and the auto buttons farter apart but there's no real problem just again ergonomically not the best choice. The screen is sharp and accurate though hard to see in bright light but no different than most LED. I agree with other review in that the A/V door feels cheap and ready to snap off. It makes me VERY careful when using it.  Finally, the Touch screen: I wasn't sure I was going to like the touch screen since I haven't any other techy touch screens. I was also concerned that sliding around functions requires several frustrating finger taps or unreal pressure. Not the case. I do really like both the touch screen and the tap option for reviewing photos. It may be hard to return to anything but a touch screen camera from now on.Again I bought the camera to step up my ability to shoot higher quality photos for internet posting since I don't print so many pictures any longer. I hope to get more comfortable with manual mode and into less program mode to begin to understand the control of aperture settings. But honestly most of the time I'm point, focus, and shoot. I did look at a whole lot of other cameras the Canon s95 being one. While being lured by the panorama option of a couple of cameras I realized that the novelty of that was not enough to deter me from going for a well designed technically proficient little camera which is what the 500 is. If you're looking for a great little under $300.00 camera that you're proud to pull out when your brother in law fumbles with his honking SLR- this is it.ps:I would advise ordering a nice case for the camera and a decent size SD card at the same time as the big screen seems to scream out PROTECT ME!!! and you will want to run out and shoot 8G of pics", "Date": "August 8, 2011"}, {"Title": "POOR.

The common issue was accidental videos.  The touch screen controls are frustrating at times.  It is much easier to control things with a button than the touch screen.There is no optical viewfinder in this camera which can be an issue at times.

I know Nikon added a pointing stick (or whatever you may call it) on their coolpix touchscreen cameras. Whether Canon intentionally added that pointy side or not, it is a great solution to the sluggish response to the touch.

I settled on this one due since it was $70 less than the one I really wanted.  Big mistake.I've owned the camera for 3 months now, unfortunately, past the 30 day return window for Amazon.  (Side note: buyer beware...Cameras are a risky buy from Amazon because if your camera doesn't show problems until 31 days later, tough luck for you).  At first, I thought it was a decent camera.  I played with the settings to get more lighting in my dimly lit home, and thought it might be doable.  Well, now that we are in the \"dark season\" of the year, I'm having problems getting clear shots.  About half of my photos indoors are unfocused, and the camera seems to \"stuggle\" with focusing, taking precious seconds that make a world of difference when taking shots of children.  It also blurs horribly with children moving (a huge problem for Christmas morning coming up).After a month of use, I noticed the lens cover seemed to have a problem opening and closing.  It's getting worse.  When I turn the camera on, the cover doesn't retract the whole way, so I have to push it in to keep it from blocking the lens.  And when I turn the camera off, the lens has a little gap in the center where it won't close the whole way.  That is a big problem.  How will this camera last without getting scratches and dirt on the lens?  And it's a pain to have to remember to push the cover in so that I can get a quick shot of something unexpected.I also dislike the touch screen.  At first, I liked it.  But I've found it to be unresponsive several times, and it's not old enough to be worn out.  BTW, I don't own any expensive touch screens like iphones that I'm comparing it with, so it's not that I'm some techie snob.Overall, I dislike using this camera for any type of action, including daily children's activities.  So if you want a camera to get pics of your kids, this one is not for you (unless you live outside with natural lighting, because those shots are usually okay).  I also think the touchscreen won't last long enough, and the camera will be useless once it stops working because every function is controlled through the touchscreen.I wish I hadn't bought it, and now I'm out $210 and stuck with a lemon camera.", "Date": "December 17, 2011"}, {"Title": "Nice but not perfect", "Author": "Trung Tuan Tran \"soonerballa\"", "ReviewID": "R2ROA4H7SDLFZ1", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "The camera has some nice features but the picture quality is not as nice as I thought it would be.

The second one did not have the hissing/ringing sound, but the image quality was no better.  So back it went for a refund!I'm not a photographer.  I don't know much about using manual controls, but I do know a sharp clear image when I see one.  I almost always use the Auto mode and mainly take pictures of my family.  All my comments are on pictures taken in Auto mode using my old Canon SD450 and new Canon 500HS.I have a 4 year old Canon SD450 and it takes sharper images than the 500HS.  At best, maybe out of every 10 pictures, I got one that wasn't extremely soft or blurry, but never really sharp.  Outdoor images didn't compare in clarity or sharpness to the SD450.  Granted, indoor images didn't need the flash in low light and when the flash was used the background was not as dark as with the SD450, but images were always extremely soft in comparison.  After having a camera that takes a really sharp picture, a soft picture is no longer acceptable.I went with a Canon because my SD450 was such a great camera for its time.  I have been reading a lot of reviews now on all kinds of cameras and unfortunately, it seems like all the point and shoot cameras today, although they have a lot of great new features, have actually gone down in picture quality.  If they could make a camera like the SD450 (which was produced at least 4 years ago) take really sharp pictures, why can't they make a point and shoot today that produces a really sharp picture.

I'm going to get a different camera and the HD movies I take don't come out as good as they do with my iphone.

In the last 6 years, I have bought and sold so many digital cameras as I always want the latest model and features.  I usually use the camera for a maximum of 1 year and then sell it and buy a new one.  The only camera that I used for 3 years was Sony DSC P 200.  I sold that bought this Canon camera as I wanted to try Canon for first time.  Unfortunately I did not like it much as the photo quality was poorer than even my old Sony DSC P200.  Even a zoom of 4x appeared very pixelated.  I tried all settings and read the user manual twice to adjust settings.  But still not much improvement.I now have a Sony HX9V and am very very happy with it.", "Date": "March 13, 2012"}, {"Title": "Very disappointing: does not outperform smartphone cameras", "Author": "Robbert Patrison", "ReviewID": "R3T5SNFX8IUS9I", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "Based on the good reviews on Amazon I bought this camera as a present for my wife. We went on a vacation and it seemed a good idea to have a better-quality alternative to smartphones cameras with their tiny optics.  We shot 900+ pictures under various condition using the new camera. We also made a few hundred pictures with the iPhone 4 and 4s, so we could make a fairly objective comparison under various lighting circumstances.The camera looks good and feels well-built. It seemed a worthy successor to our excellent 4MP PowerShot ELPH S400 from 10 years ago. Based on the first impression, we had high expectations of our new top-of-the-line compact camera.Unfortunately the ELPH 500 camera disappointed badly. The picture quality is really poor, essentially ruining our vacation pictures. For most picture types, the ELPH 500 was significantly worse than the iPhone 4s (which has a much smaller lens and 25% fewer pixels). In none of the shots was this camera any better than the iPhone.The main problem is the image quality. Many pictures that our ELPH 500 produced were simply unsharp. The autofocus seemed to misjudge the situation often. Also, the poor focus seemed to be worse on the right half of the picture which might indicate a manufacturing problem unique to our camera. In any case, Canon's quality assurance should have caught this issue. Low light performance was no better than the iPhone, while high-contrast performance was noticeably worse. The only redeeming feature of the ELPH 500 is its optical zoom and stronger flash.The back of the ELPH 500 is a good-looking large LCD touch screen. While the screen quality is great, the touch interface is pretty poor. It does the job, but its a huge step back compared to any smartphone. Most notably are the lack of multi-touch zoom and the inconsistent response to gestures. As the other reviews noted, battery life is inexcusably poor, running empty after about 150 pictures.We are returning this camera back to Amazon. If it doesn't produce significantly better pictures, there is absolutely zero point in owning a dedicated camera that is bigger, more expensive, lacks geotagging and has worse battery life than a smartphone.", "Date": "January 8, 2012"}, {"Title": "Wish I had not bought this camera", "Author": "John", "ReviewID": "R24DLN3CH180DP", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "I really wish I had not bought this camera. I've been a fan of the SD line forever it seems. My last one was an SD 1000 and I loved it! So I \"upgraded\" to the 500HS and regret it very much. The image quality is good - not great but good. The wide angle distorts but is useful, and the video quality is astounding. The pre-programmed modes are really cool, especially the false tilt-shift and low light modes. I love the aperture and shutter value control!Now to the bad points. The door flap for the usb cable feels cheap and it feels like it will break at some point - not such a big deal. The lens makes a slight grinding noise when extending and retracting - annoying and a bit disturbing for a unit like this. The final part - the touch screen is AWFUL. I despise it. It's so hard to get to basic functions and it's very easy to make mistakes. What on earth were they thinking when they came up with that. Really poor design and I hope they either make a huge improvement or eliminate it altogether. I am thinking of getting rid of the camera and going back to some model with mechanical controls.I do not recommend the ELPH 500HS.", "Date": "February 13, 2012"}, {"Title": "Horrible image quality", "Author": "Brandon Cannan", "ReviewID": "R2B7VQF3340PKS", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "Used this camera to take around 50 pictures around Christmas.  Almost every picture is blurry and/or washed out.  Could take two pictures in the exact same area with the exact same camera settings and they would turn out completely different.

When it flashes, in a dark room, a VERY clear shadow is produced - caused by light from the flash being blocked by the extended lens.  Call me old fashioned, but I think the first thing a camera should do is take clear pictures.  If it doesn't do that ( in every reasonable scenario ), then it fails.The touchscreen is neat!  However.  It seems way too easy to touch, when one is actually trying to take a picture.  That can screw up your whole day.  I, and probably the usability manager for this product, would say that I need some retraining.  Meaning, I don't find this too serious, it's kind of like when we used to drape our fingers over the front of the camera and cover up the lens or flash.  However, it has been a point of frustration.Buy two batteries.  It \"seems\" to me that I get a low battery, then 'poof' no battery.  Very glad I got a second battery.  Because the price is low, make sure to pick up an extra charger as well.  That way, when you get home from a day of whatever, you can plop both of them in and not worry about switching them out.I have NOT found a great case for this camera.  Reading reviews - the cases are either way too HUGE or just perfect ( the Canon case ).  I guess I'm Goldilocks on that accord.  I find it fits GREAT in my breast pocket, along with the extra battery.Finally, it *sure* *seems* sturdy, like what I've come to expect from Canon.  I've another ELPH here somewhere, that was stolen by my teenagers.  It's taken a licken and kept on ticken, for sure.  I'm certain I'll have this camera for a long while, just have to buy some sort of external flash to make the camera part of it work.", "Date": "April 3, 2012"}, {"Title": "Wont power on after 1 foot tall drop.", "Author": "SumYumGai", "ReviewID": "R27JOCCW47XYS", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "I got this camera last night from best buy, and was playing around with it,pro: cool feature, easy to use, light weight, touch screen, smart automode make point and shoot is much more interesting and easier for user.con: died after 1 foot tall drop, so not reliable, I cant believe this camera is so fragile , it wont power on after the incident, i took of my short and drop it on the ground from my chair, and it wont power on, tried to recharge battery and everything but wont work.so disappoint at this.", "Date": "September 23, 2011"}, {"Title": "Touch screen", "Author": "Don Levy", "ReviewID": "R1TM2SM5G1GE9X", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "The touch screen does not function easily and causes much frustration.
