The 1.3 megapixels are perfect for a novice.  I can get great quality prints up to a 5x7.  I think if you are needing 8x10s, you may want to move up to a 2.2 megapixel.  This bundle is great.  It has everything you need to get started.  The camera is very user friendly, and has a lot of neat options for the price.  The dock is a must for anyone who doesn't want to deal with batteries and the normal USB upload.  Kodak has done an excellent job making digital photolgraphy easy for those who don't have time to deal with some of the more complicated technology out there.  Another nice thing about this bundle is the free memory card.  The DX3215 has an internal memory card that will hold 20 pictures on best quality.  The removable card will hold about 100 on best.  So with the memory card and the dock which is also a recharger, using the camera for a weekend or other extended time is great.  The Kodak software is very simple to use, and has a lot of neat options.  I would recommend this camera to anyone wanting to get into digital photography, or just replace that old 35mm.  You will be very pleased with the usefullness of this package.", "Date": "November 26, 2001"}, {"Title": "Great camera bundle for under [dollar amount]", "Author": "M. Schroeder \"M1S\"", "ReviewID": "R1PE3MAE7WFR0Y", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "This is a pretty decent camera, especially at the price.  I get very sharp pictures with good color.  I found three problems which I found annoying.  The on/off button is very tiny and you almost need to use a fingernail to push it (and hold for a few seconds).  The second gripe I have is the LCD view finder cuts off after about 3 or 4 flash pictures, and then you need to start using the \"see-through\" view finder which brings me to my third and last gripe.  This \"see-through\" view finder seems to be aimed too high and cuts off the top of the picture.  I just aim higher and get it right, but wish it was aligned correctly.  All in all, not bad for the $$ paid.  I expected worse.  The base for picture transfers is fantastic.  I had a Samsung (cheap and broken) camera which took around 20 to 30 minutes to transfer fifteen to twenty low quality pictures.  The Kodac w/base only takes a few seconds to maybe a minute to transfer 20 high quality pics of around 1mb each pic.  I was excited to see how quickly it was done.  The short lifespan of 2AA batteries power is more than made up for by the charger cradle.  I hope the Kodac lasts longer than my Samsung.", "Date": "November 24, 2001"}, {"Title": "A great starter Digital camera.", "Author": "Vinit Carpenter \"j2eegeek.com/blog\"", "ReviewID": "R1ZL8SMJF06EUQ", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I purchased the Kodak DX3215 Digital Camera with the USB dock and I have been very impressed with it so far.  This is a starter camera and doesn't have a lot of frills.  The construction of the camera, the buttons, etc. tells you that this is a relatively cheap camera but there are no functional issues with it.  This is a great camera that's capable of 1.3 megapixel and has a 2X digital zoom lens.  The camera comes with 8MB of internal RAM which will store about 20 pictures at 1024x768.  There is an expansion slot of additional memory and I picked up the SanDisk 32 MB card for that slot which stores about 100 pictures at 1024x768.In a nutshell, this is a really good starter Digital camera without a lot of frills.  Great for someone who wants a good Digital camera but doesn't want to pay $500 for it.  If you want a really good Digital camera, my choice would be the Canon Powershot G2 Digital Camera.

Often my clients are far away from the scene that I am investigating.  I normally use a high-end 35mm camera (as digital images in legal settings is still somewhat of a gray area) but when I need to send pictures right away, getting the film developed and scanning in the prints just takes too long.I had originally purchased for my wife, who also takes alot of pictures at famaily gatherings, etc.  Soon after it arrived, however, I started taking it with me on cases.  I started taking a few photographs at every scene with the digital camera so that I could show my clients what I was seeing right away.  My clients loved it and soon required this service on all of the cases.  Needless to say, I had to buy a second camera so that my wife could use hers.The camera is very easy to set up.  It comes with a docking station that allows you to transfer pictures to your computer with the touch of a button.  It also charges the battery while it sits on the dock.  I haven't had a problem with the battery life, but if the rechargeable battery ever dies you can simply put in two AA batteries to finish out the day.I would say that anyone who has not used a digital camera before should start here.

The 2:1 optical zoom is fine & the 1 megapixel resolution is adequate for all internet applications as well as for printing 4\" x 6\" photos. The docking station included in this package makes this a very simple camera to recharge and it also makes the transferring of images to a PC almost foolproof. That means a great deal, as the 3215, left in its cradle, is always charged and ready to go, and once returned to its cradle, archiving or emailing becomes an easy task even for a novice. The overall quality is okay but not spectacular, with a cheap plastic feel to it. The weight and balance are also just fair.

I specifically wanted one that made connecting to the computer easy and also wanted software that I could easily manage. The camera has provided me with good results for both of these concerns.  Also, the dock keeps the batteries recharged and the included AC adaptor saves batteries. I was pleased and surprised to get a lithium battery with the kit in addition to the rechargable one. I can use this in the camera when away from the dock.  Initally I found turning the camera on and off a bit difficult because of the small size of the button. Then a grandson showed me that I should just hold the fleshy part of my finger on the button and doing so eliminated the problem. I like the ability given by the software to correct and enhance photos.  I had three indoor shots taken by my lighted Christmas tree which were dark. The brightness enhancement feature restored them.

Anderson \"kfander\"", "ReviewID": "R37LS3BXHBV485", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I just received my DX3215 Zoom Digital Camera (With Dock) for Christmas. After some frustrating moments when the battery pack appeared unwilling to accept a charge, I read the directions and learned that it needed to be charged several times the first time around. Even then, the instructions are not quite clear. I first read them to suggest that I needed to leave it on the charger for the entire 2.5 hours despite the light having turned green after only a half hour or so. This proved not to be the case. It appears that it needs to be actively charging (with the light red) for 2.5 hours. Lifting the camera up from the dock and resetting it everytime the charge light went green, I was able to get it to charge just fine, although I gave it far more than 2.5 hours.After its initial charging, subsequent charging times are normal, and the camera can be used once the light turns green.If it requires an initial 2.5 hour charge, then the light should not turn green prior to that time. If, for some reason, this is impossible, then the instructions could be made to be a little clearer.  That is my only complaint.I'm dropping my rating by one point for this reason alone. Other than that, the camera works great. It takes good pictures, and passes them on to my computer painlessly. If you are willing to be patient with the initial charging time, I don't think you'll be dissatisfied with the results.

It's no more convenient to use the dock than it is to hook the wire to the camera and only the battery pack is recharged by the dock.  Regular rechargeables still need a separate charger.

The great features are still there - excellent picture quality, photo review, tv hook-up.

It uses a different memory card from the Kodak we have, though - thought we'd be able to swap cards. The camera has lighweight, almost flimsy feel to it since they're made mostly of plastic, but that's the case even with the more expesnive models.  They also changed buttons and functions around so that it was confusing to \"unlearn\" what we had learned from the older camera. The new camera is much smaller, too, and there is no room for labels as there was on the bigger, older models.The software was problematic.  We couldn't get it to run properly on a Dell laptop running Windows ME.  It didn't really matter, though, since we can use something else.  She's also had problems with re-charging.  Sometimes it takes and sometimes it doesn't.  She's been using regular batteries to avoid the problem - a very nice feature.If you're used to the Kodak cameras of a year ago, you might be disappointed in the physical quality of the camera and the function control changes.

At the time, it was the cheapest offering an optical zoom, which is what I was looking for.  The optical zoom works out nicely - it makes the camera have an effective 30-60mm lense, which is nice for distance shots.  This camera does take some time to get to know and use properly, but once you have enough experience with it, you can get some good pictures (like through a microscope eyepiece - it was amazing).  The outdoor shots are amazing, especially in terms of color reproduction.  Indoor shots are variable, but it does take good low-light photos with the flash off, but the flash OK, just gets some colors a little wrong sometimes.  The battery life is short, so you will need rechargeable batteries (these were well worth the investment, as acceptable batteries are $... a pair, while rechargeables+charger=$...).  As for the camera dock, I think it is the stupidest thing ever and invented just to get more money out of people - YOU DO NOT NEED THE CAMERA DOCK (I avoided purchasing it).  I don't even use the included software, I just copy pictures over.  The LCD screen is a bit hard to see sometimes, and MMC cards are finally getting more common (I have ~160 megs of cards now, and took pictures for a month in europe on them).
