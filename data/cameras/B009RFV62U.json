Drove to the beach to take pics. Then discovered I can take only 1 test photo without a memory card. Memory card does not come with it & costs about $12. No mention of memory card on the box. Camera is not as good a deal as it looks. Other than that it is light weight. Fits in a pocket. Haven't used it yet.", "Date": "January 4, 2014"}, {"Title": "info", "Author": "Susan McTeir", "ReviewID": "R1XP3Y6OH41LQT", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "was very disappointed that it dd not come with a instruction manual, you must go online and either read it or print it out (67 pages) it has a lot of features, therefore I had to print the manual. very frustrating", "Date": "April 12, 2013"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": "$69.00", "Features": "Anti-Shake Technology\n4X Zoom\nShoots Video Clips", "Name": "Vivitar 9112SL ViviCam 9 MP Digital Camera with 1.8-Inch LCD Body (Purple)", "ImgURL": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/31ZsZF-Q01L._SY300_.jpg", "ProductID": "B009RFV62U"}}
