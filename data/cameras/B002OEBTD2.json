Most recently the 40D.The Rebel series was never comfortable for my large hands.I bought this Pentax K-x on a whim as it was really inexpensive, offered a lot of features and promised very good high ISO results.It has met or exceeded all my expectations!I haven't been this impressed with a new camera since my 1st DSLR, that $3000 Canon D30!It is small but comfortable to use, even in my big hands, and the pictures at ISO 1600 look like ISO 400 on other brands,Even ISO 3200 is very usable!The kit lens is very sharp!As an added bonus you can use most any Pentax lens ever made which opens up a huge opportunity to try some Legacy lenses.I have sold my Canon gear and this little Pentax does everything better and in a much more compact form.It even shoots decent HD video.I even was able to get a smaller camera bag.Very Highly recommended!!", "Date": "January 15, 2010"}, {"Title": "its awesome", "Author": "ZeAndroid", "ReviewID": "RL1VGS6BNM5V6", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "levels of details, image quality, noise, features - I love everything about this little gem. Video is good too and my only complaint is that it needed a lithium-ion rechargeable battery to support more battery life when using movie\\live mode. Its enough when using 4 AA lithium batteries - it lasts for at least a 1000s shots plus some occasional live mode and movie usage. Ive read about Sanyo eneloop rechargeables (these should last longer) but havent tried them yet. But with regular rechargeables it doesnt last that long enough.I love the low noise and amount of details I can get shooting up to 1600 ISO - night shots (no flash), aquarium or theater images now look beautiful and I dont have to use a flash. All shot with 1600 ISO gives me enough shutter speed to get great sharp and detailed images.UPDATE: 12/15/2009Pentax released a firmware update for k-x dSLR that fixes battery problem.[...]I have installed the firmware and it looks like it does fixes the problem. Now it doesnt give me half-battery orange indicator when I use my lithiums (its still green).I havent tried it with rechargeables because I dont have any yet (still using my lithiums).UPDATE: 04/01/2010I bought Sanyo Eneloop Rechargeable Batteries - those working out pretty well in holding the charge.Since December I think I only recharged them two or three times and the indicator got into red just yesterday.For more images taken with k-x visit my flickr stream[...]", "Date": "December 2, 2009"}, {"Title": "Amazing entry-level DSLR for such a low price", "Author": "A. Mumma", "ReviewID": "R1DDJCCXGKP9E1", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I have experience using film SLRs as well as a Nikon DSLR, and I've owned a few Canon compact cameras. After quite a bit of online research, I chose this camera to be my first DSLR, and I am very, very pleased with my decision.The K-x is small for a DSLR, and I've gotten a few surprised comments from people seeing me pull such a fancy camera out of a small messenger bag. Even so, it has a sturdy feel to it and doesn't feel too tiny in my relatively large hands. I also like the black and white body and have gotten compliments about that as well.The camera has an AUTO PICT mode for newcomers that takes control of the focus, shutter speed, aperture, and ISO; all you need to do is aim at your subject and press the shutter button. There are also a wide variety of scene modes (macro, portrait, landscape, candlelight, kids, etc.) that are tailored for specific situations. But for people who like to take creative control, there are the typical priority modes (aperture, shutter, and ISO) as well as manual mode. The buttons are few enough that you can easily memorize how to manipulate the camera without having to dig through menus for the important functions. There's even a green button that can act as a shortcut to certain features; I like to use it for enabling cross-processing.Speaking of which, the K-x features some digital filters (toy camera, high contrast, retro, etc.) that seem superficial but can be very interesting to use. However, my favorite mode by far is cross-processing, which causes the colors, contrast, and saturation of pictures to be randomly distorted, creating some pretty spectacular results from seemingly unspectacular subjects. Enabling this mode adds some unpredictability and fun to digital photography normally exclusive to film cameras (lomography, anyone?) or Photoshop.Of course, the K-x also packs a lot of serious features comparable with more expensive DSLRs on the market, such as a 12 meagpixel resolution, built-in image stabilization, 4.7 photos per second shooting speed, and a broad ISO range up to 12800. It boasts compatibility with any Pentax lens, which will be useful later on when I get tired of the kit lens. I also deeply appreciate the use of AA batteries, which are cheap to buy, easy to find, and can also be rechargeable. The built-in microphone and ability to record in sharp, 720p 24fps video is also great for spontaneous moments when you need to shoot video and don't have a camcorder handy.After using the camera for about a month, I've encountered a few setbacks. The camera has difficulty automatically focusing in certain low-light situations, requiring manual focus. Then there is the lack of manual focus assistance in the viewfinder. If you are focusing manually, you have to rely on focusing by sight, which can be difficult. This is compounded by the fact that the resolution of the screen is not extremely sharp, enough so that when you review a picture the subject may not seem blurry unless you zoom in to check. The viewfinder also does not indicate which autofocus point is chosen, making its use a bit of a gamble. Also, there's the faint clicking noise that the image stabilization makes during movie mode, and there is no jack for an external microphone. Recording movies also eats batteries, eats memory card space, and causes the camera to heat up quickly, but these problems are present in all current DSLRs anyway, so don't buy a DSLR solely for its video capabilities. These are all the small problems I've encountered, but they hardly pose major setbacks and can be easily worked around.Overall, this camera is highly configurable and packs an enormous amount of features for such an inexpensive camera. If you have never owned a DSLR before or are searching for a powerful budget camera, I highly recommend the Pentax K-x.", "Date": "February 22, 2010"}, {"Title": "The Pentax K-x is a giant killer!", "Author": "Edgar_in_Indy", "ReviewID": "R1P2A4WDCVZEBZ", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I recently upgraded from my beloved Olympus e-510 DSLR with the 14-42mm and 40-150mm kits lenses in order to get a DSLR with better low-light performance and HD video capabilities. I loved my Olympus, but image quality took a nose-dive at ISO 800, and I liked the idea of having an HD camcorder built into my camera to capture high quality family photos and home videos in one device. I eventually settled on the Pentax K-x after first buying, and then returning, a Canon T2i.I know that the T2i costs almost twice as much as the K-x, and they're not direct competitors, but I think my experience illustrates what a great camera and bargain the K-x is and how, for me at least, it was a giant killer.I initially pre-ordered a T2i for the $900 MSRP after reading the glowing reviews in the press about the 18MP sensor, the high-ISO performance and the killer 1080p video. When I received the T2i, I was surprised by how cheap and plasticky it felt. It's not that the T2i was likely to fall apart, but my Olympus felt and looked like a higher quality camera, even though it was about $200 less than the T2i when I bought it. I realize that the T2i is a Rebel, but for almost $1000, I expected something more solid.Even worse was the Canon 18-55mm kit lens, which felt like a toy compared to my Olympus kit lenses. It looked cheap, and the zoom action felt very cheap, and you could hear plastic-on-plastic as you zoomed in and out. There was no lens hood included, and the optional lens hood was only about an inch deep and looked ridiculous. The front element rotated when auto-focusing, which makes using some filters problematic, and you had to switch off AF to manually make focus adjustments. My Olympus lenses did not rotate the front element, and allowed full time focus override without turning off AF. And build-wise, they looked and felt like a higher end lens. But worst of all, Canon kits lens's optical performance was lacking, rendering the 18MP sensor moot.I could live with the cheap feel of the T2i body and the ugly jelly-bean design, but I came to realize that in order to get a lens that would match the performance of the body, I would need to shell out another $500 or more, and as a hobbyist I just didn't have the budget.The real deal-breaker with the T2i though, was the use of Quicktime format for the HD video. Quicktime is a proprietary Apple video format, and while I must assume it works well on a new Mac, the QT videos often gave PCs problems. I'd read about this from other users, but I figured that with my high-end PCs and my computer knowledge, I would be okay. But both my new Sony Vaio laptop with Windows 7, ATI 4650 graphics and 4GB of RAM and my desktop computer with Windows XP, dual-core processor, 4GB of RAM, Raptor 10K HDD and nVidia 8800GT graphics would stutter on playback of the 1080p files. And finding affordable programs to edit Quicktime HD video files is another headache. I wasn't about to buy a new Mac just to be able to work with the video from my new camera.So back went the T2i, and my quest for a new camera continued. I was just about to pull the trigger on a Nikon D5000, when I came across the Pentax K-x.The first thing that grabbed my attention was the styling. I thought the camera looked dead-sexy in navy blue, but when I saw the white version, I was in love. One thing I liked about my Olympus was that it was something DIFFERENT than all the Nikons and Canon Rebels you see every other parent carrying to school or sports functions. I would often get questions about it from people who didn't realize that Olympus even MADE DSLRs. With this Pentax, I would again have something out of the ordinary.Then I started reading reviews of the K-x. One of the great things about the T2i is the high ISO image quality, and according to the reviews and the sample images I was looking at, the K-x was right there with it.And the K-x also did HD video. There were some limitations, such as 720p and lack of full control over exposure while shooting video, but I didn't really mind since the samples I downloaded looked great, even on my 110\" 1080P home theater projector. And 720p files take less space than 1080p and require less processing power to playback and edit. And best of all, the K-x uses Motion JPEG video format, which plays back great on PCs and is compatible with almost any Windows video editing program. The MJPEG format does use more disk space than the equivalent QT file, but hard drives and SD cards are cheap these days, so it's not a big deal.Another great thing about the K-x is that it has sensor-based image stabilization in the body, so any lens you stick on the camera is stabilized. My Olympus used a similar system, and I was very happy with it. The big advantage is that you can be non-stabilized lenses so they'll be smaller, lighter, and less expensive.I ended up buying the K-x in white with the 18-55mm lens. The K-x looks and feels like a higher quality camera than the T2i, and matches my Olympus in this department. The kit lens is also a very worthy piece of hardware.With the money I saved on the Pentax, I was able to buy the legendary Tamron 28-75mm F2.8 lens, a Pentax 55-300mm zoom lens, and a Sigma speedlight. The flash was new, but I got great deals on the slighty-used lenses on eBay and Craigslist.I've been using the Pentax for a couple months now, and have taken hundreds of pictures. I am absolutely thrilled with the camera and couldn't be happier with the photos and videos I'm getting. The T2i did have just slightly more detail, but other than that I would say the K-x has equal image quality. And the 12MP RAW image files of the K-x are faster to work with than the 18MP files of the T2i and take up much less space on SD cards, so you don't have to worry about filling up nearly as fast.That's not too much negative I can say about the camera. I would like it to have a mini-HDMI port and a standard mini-USB port, and continuous auto-focus would be nice in video mode, but no other DSLR has that yet. Stereo mics would also be nice.I suspect that the image stabilization system may not be as good as the one in my Olympus, but I can't say for sure since my 300mm is longer than the telephoto I had with the Olympus and will therefore be more prone to shake.I get compliments on the Pentax everywhere I go, and it's been a joy to use and own. I could not be happier with my purchase.In the future I'll probably add a Sigma 30mm F1.4 prime and a Sigma 10-20mm ultra-wide zoom to my lens kit.Just for the record, I'm not trying to bash on the T2i. It is an amazing camera that is currently without peer in its price range. But if you're like me and you only have about $1000 to spend, I think you will get much more value by going with a less-expensive but almost-as-capable camera like the K-x, and using the extra money on high quality lenses. My F2.8 constant-aperture lens has been a revolution for me, and I recommend every budding photographer make room in their budget for something similar.", "Date": "May 29, 2010"}, {"Title": "Overall Great Value", "Author": "D. Dimov \"DD\"", "ReviewID": "R1TUUFWGWO8UNB", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "After looking through a lot of options this camera seems to offer the best combination of price performance.Some first impressions are:1. Good Hi Iso Performance with little noise. (Much better then Canon Xt then I used to own that only had 1600 max iso.)2. Able to do HD Video (720p). Video quality is ok, I compared it to my sony SR-12 HD camcoder its definitely not the same quality but it does have a unique movie type look to it, in low light its very grainy but in good light it does fine. Its a good back up to a camcoder, although you do have to get used to manual focusing to get good results. If you shoot a lot of movies get a bigger memory card, I have a 4 gig card and it only holds around 15 minutes of video in highest quality due to recording format.3. First thing to do when you get the camera make sure you update the firmware to 1.01 that will solve the battery issue that many people been having. You can check which firmware you have by pressing the menu button and then turning the camera on.So far a I took about 900 pictures and about 45 minutes of video on lithium batteries that came with the camera and only now the battery indicator shows orange.4. As with any DSLR auto mode will not give you the best results, and every camera has its own \"favorite\" settings where it gets most consistent results. So far Im still figuring out what works best with this particular camera.5. No camera is perfect but to me Good Hi Iso performance, Hd video option and price.

It has by far the most features of any camera in it's class, including HD video. It is compact but solid, actually a bit heavier than expected. 300 page manual, in small print, makes for a bit of a steep learning curve but Auto Pict mode can get you taking great photos right away. I would prefer more knobs rather than nested menus. As typical,LCD screen can be hard to see in bright light. I had to get into the shade at a sporting event to change focus mode. Manual also notes that leaving the Live View on for longer periods can cause over heating of camera. This suprises me as I have had many Digital cameras in over last ten years, none ever had an issue with over heating. Image quality is just outstanding. The low light capabilities of the KX are almost unbeleivable. Hand held shots, without flash, in normal room light came out beautifully. The days of red eyed, harsh shadowed pictures may be over! This camera can use all K-mount lenses. However slow focusing in lower light situations is a documented issue with Pentax's current auto focus system. Sadly my fun came to an end about three weeks purchase when the the CMOS sensor failed and all went to black. It has been returned to Pentax for repair but I am hoping this not a sign of quality issues.

The quality of the camera is exceptional and the image results are exceptional.  However I have has problems with dust on the sensor and have had to clean it already.

I've gotten about 700 pics on Lithium, 200 on Alkaline and it didn't work at all with rechargeable. But I still prefer the convenience of AA batteries over camera specific rechargeable. I would assume these battery results will improve in the summer. I've been shooting outside in sub freezing temperatures.  Cold weather reduces battery performance. For most users the lens it comes with will be more than acceptable.

The Nikon D700 is still better, at four or five times the price.Even though I somewhat prefer the UI of the K20 with it's second scroll wheel, the K-x has become my primary camera and the K20 my secondary. That's how wonderful this camera is.Exposure accuracy is far better than either the K20 or K100, as is autofocus.  The K7 may be better, but I haven't tried it for sure.While the K-x is listed as an entry level camera, almost everyone I know who has one are experienced photographers who buy them for high ISO or second body, most of whom end up using it as their primary body.I did not buy it for it's video mode, and it will take some practice to reliably get good video out of it, but the clips I've gotten where I got everything right are amazing. Put the FA77 on it and take some concert footage and it'll look like pro video.While the kit lens is probably the best kit lens on the market, and I've gotten some great shots the couple of times that I've played with it, the camera definitely deserves some of Pentax's better glass.  Put the DA40 on it and you'll have an amazing pocket camera.The white body gets a fair share of notice especially when I put the helmet from a stormtrooper bobble head doll on it as a flash diffuser.

I went with Pentax because I was very happy with my past Pentax cameras (all manual K1000 ages ago and more recently a PZ-1) and I wanted to keep using a couple of good zoom lenses I had for the PZ-1. Two additional requirements were the DSLR be capable of movie recording and be no more than $750, preferably around $500. The K-x met all the requirements and I couldn't pass it up when Amazon offered it for $520!!! I think Pentax offers the best value - good quality, superb features at a reasonable price - compared to Canon or Nikon.Upon arrival, the first think I did was put in the batteries that came with it and upgraded the firmware with an old 1 GB SD card (from the minolta). That went without a glitch. I took a hanfdul of shots around the home to test it. The picture quality was great. The camera was easy to use, i.e. navigating the menus was intuitive. It was compatible with my two old lenses. It worked fine with my Sanyo eneloop rechargeables, though I had to recharge them every other day after heavy use (the manual does hint at this). I got a 8GB SanDisk Class 4 SD card, and that too worked fine. Connecting to the PC and transferring the images using Picasa was straightforward and there really was no need to install the SW that came with the camera. After couple of weeks of heavy use on my vacation, I amy very satisfied with my purchase.Though the camera has liveview mode and movie capability, I found these features to be rather \"clumsy\" - sort of expected that based on other reviews. The features worked well in limted cases. In some cases, the focus search algorithm was horribly slow. I think this applies to other DSLRs too.

It's a manual workhorse that's never let me down and I've been a die-hard Pentax fan since.  I've also been reluctant to make the jump to DSLR from film.  I have a point and shoot digital but nothing for serious photography.  I've been intimidated by all the features and functions of a grown up DSLR.  I now know this is the camera I've been waiting for.  I bought this for an upcoming trip to Europe and I'm positively giddy about this camera.  First, the white is just cool.  I've got a white MacBook, so why not a camera too?  The whole thing is a little bigger than I expected it to be, which makes finding a camera case challenging.  I've been reading the manual and I'm still a little intimidated, but I think this will be easy enough to learn quickly.The auto mode is responsive and intuitive.  It focuses fast and shoots accurately.  It can decide for you the settings or allow you to choose for yourself.  I love that Pentax puts the shake reduction gizmo in the body instead of the lens like Nikon does.  I think it balances the camera a bit better and the cost of future lenses is less.  The entire Pentax system allows lenses to be swapped from one camera to the next, so the lenses I have for my K1000 will work with this one.On the batteries.... I much prefer using AA batteries for a digital camera.  The proprietary batteries used in other camera are expensive.  I also feel they don't last as long before needing to be recharged.  When I'm home, I can use a rechargeable AA Lithium battery.  If I'm abroad, I know I can find AAs on the fly if I need to.  Yes, it contributes to the overall weight of the camera, but I can live with it for the convenience of buying more if I need to and not losing that one great shot.  Photography has always been a hobby of mine and I've been known to look more through the lens than through my own eyes on a vacation.  On my first day in Montreal, I took almost 250 photos in one market.  Proprietary batteries simply can't keep up with someone like me.Read the specks and compare prices.  Pentax makes a darn good camera for a very fair price.  They aren't as well known in the US (as far as I can tell-no authorized dealers within 300 miles of where I live) and I suspect not as heavily marketed as Nikon and Canon.  I've had this camera for a day now and I can't believe I actually thought about getting a Nikon instead.  I had this item in my Amazon cart for the better part of 6 months.

My Canon 3mp from 2002 made excellent prints up to 8x10 and had manual features but was bound to break or wear out - it did.Image quality, handling, build quality, etc all good as mentioned in the 5 star reviews.  I bought this when the price finally hit my buy point (under $500) with one of those pre Christmas coupons (they needed to move the white and red models).  At the $600 price level I was going to wait for the next version.  Got it and am happy with it for the price.My main interest in this camera (color option was not of much concern) was to be able to reuse some manual focus aperture priority lens that I used with my 70s model Pentax ME film camera.  They work and make awesome pictures but the camera does not read the manually set aperture selection as on the ME - does not get recorded with the picture and you have to look at the lens (or get good counting clicks) to know your setting.  The manual focus was easier to view on the ME but at least you can use the live view zoom focus or listen for beeping or look for the focus indicator.  It will set the shutter for you if in auto mode or P or A mode just like the ME but with the auto ISO selection to further fine tune the picture.HD movie mode was also of interest but assumed it would be secondary - it is.  Even with shake reduction off, it still records every tiny noise the camera makes.  The mic is very sensitive.  It will come in handy from time to time but would not base a purchase on that feature.Some people complain of the autofocus point not being visible in the viewfinder - I tend to use point focus and am still experimenting with auto exposure options.  Not quite excellent but can't really complain - yet.The Kx buttons I guess are typical for a DSLR and are so nice to have compared to most P&S.;  The Green button looks like it will come in handy once I get used to having it - quick reset of some overrides.The auto mode makes this DSLR handle like a P&S; only faster.  The autofocus in low light tends to search a bit more than my Canon P&S; especially in low light but manual override is easy.  Once in auto, I could hand this camera to most anyone to take decent pictures.I recommend to get this camera at a lower price (<$500) or wait for the next version.  If you are not planning to use more lenses than this kit lens you probably will be better off with the newer Canon or Panasonic \"low light\" P&S; cameras currently priced around $400 or less.", "Date": "January 6, 2010"}, {"Title": "Still love my Pentax K-x", "Author": "W.

The kit lens is very nice.  I only have two real gripes with the camera.  #1 is the codec that pentax chose for encoding video makes for GIANT files.  #2 is the lack of autofocus when shooting video.  I am getting better at focusing manually but it does take some practice.  At the time that I bought the camera in order to get autofocus for video in a DSLR you had to pay three times what I paid for my K-x with the introduction of the new Canon Rebel T2i that is no longer the case.  I haven't seen samples from the rebel yet so I can't comment on its image quality.  The K-x excels at hi iso images and produces perfectly printable images all the way up to 3200 images at 6400 are pretty noisy and the expanded range of 12800 is really not that great but you rarely need it.  My point and shoot couldn't really make a printable image past ISO 400 so this is a HUGE improvement.I also love the fact that it is storm trooper white.

I found a slightly used Kx ($350, white body+ 18-55mm lens/1600shots on it at the time). At first, without in-depth reading  I experienced much frustration with the initial learning curve.

That said, this camera is a joy to shoot with and I really am glad I bought it.The image quality is excellent. I really like Pentax's noise profile and a lot of pictures have almost a magazine-like quality to them. This is with the kit lens but I also have the 55-200mm lens which works well too. I find the menu pretty easy to navigate and find it very easy to manipulate the manual settings quickly. The flash is ok but probably would be wise to get an external one if you're super-picky about your low-light photos (but even still low-light photos are quite decent. (Sidenote: The K2000 came in a kit with an external flash - not sure why the K-X doesn't). I am finding this camera takes pretty flawless photos up to and including ISO 1600... which is pretty good for an entry-level DSLR. It also has a 96% coverage viewfinder which is excellent for this class of camera.I happen to like AA battery power source - I believe it gives you way more flexibility though it does add some weight to the camera. Though if Pentax really wanted to ice the competition in this segment they would bring down the hybrid battery bay found in the K-R to whatever the follow-up model to the K-X will be. Overall ergonomics are ok on the camera. It's a very small DSLR so if you have big hands you may not feel as comfortable with it as you would a larger DSLR. But still I found it fairly comfortable to shoot with. The camera is mostly plastic but feels pretty well constructed.Now onto some complaints... I think the placement of flash button is poor. Located above the LCD instead of the side of the camera. The camera is rather loud in operation (though not in a clunky way) - the autofocus sounds like a small power tool when its operating. The LCD is not that great... seems like it's very low-resolution. But, again, these are just minor annoyances which are typical for entry-level DSRLs.And finally... the price. For $580 off of Amazon I got the body, kit lens, and the 55-200mm lens. I consider that to be a steal.

This issue has the full test report of the K-x and I just couldn't wait to read it.  The little Pentax compares favorably with the Nikon D3000 and the Canon Rebel XS.  After using it today, I think the Pentax is much better.  Every photo I took was perfectly exposed and the auto focus even nailed a hawk 500 feet away.  While small, it's not tiny and and weighs 20.5 ozs. It feels comfortable in my medium sized hands.  I've had the Pentax K-7 since it came out last year and the K-x compares nicely with it.  You have the same digital filters, in-camera croping and custom functions.  It's not weatherproof so you can't take it out in the rain.  I got the white model.  It's a standout, especially with a telephoto zoom on it.  I haven't tried the video.  P.P. says it's on par with what you can expect with most DSLRs.  I tried some interior shots at high ISO (6400 and 12800).  They seemed OK in the LCD and not much noise.  P.P. says at 6400 the Pentax performed better than the Nikon did at 3200.  The cameras menu is the best i've seen on ANY camera.  It's easy to navigate and not complicated.  Batteries seem to be an issue with this camera.  I installed the ones that came with the kit and they work fine.  I've made up my mind that because the camera cost so little, I can aford to keep a spare pack or two of lithiums on hand all the time.  The shelf life is awesome.  The kit lens is great. It handles better and the zoom is better damped than either the Nikon or Canon kit lenses (I have both ).  The close focus is better too.  The digital filters are what I really like about this camera.  Neither Nikon nor Canon have them on any models that I know of.  You can take an ordinary photo and change it into something interesting and beautiful.  Most of the photos on my wall were made using the filters.  You don't need a computer or photoshop to make them and you still keep your original files.  Another neat thing this camera has that no one seems to mention is a little electric blue \"on\" lamp that's on top right next to the power switch.  It's really bright and you'll know if your camera is still turned on.

It is an entry level DSLR.  I've compared my image quality to the more expensive Canon DSLRs.  The K-x produces fuzzier images with a bit more noticeable chromatic aberration.  That being said, you do have to look pretty closely to see the difference between the K-x to the results from a Canon's almost 3 times the price of the K-x.  But if you do care about such things - yes, there is a difference and it is visible to the naked eye.The K-x can work as a point and shoot which is great because the whole family can use it - Set it to \"auto\", turn on Live View,and push the button to snap a picture.  But the manual controls are easy to control and once you understand the way aperture, shutter speed, ISO, and exposure work together, taking photos with this camera becomes a rewarding and stimulating process.The weak points of the K-x:  The optical image stabilization feature in Video mode makes a loud noise like metal on metal clanking continuously.  This is a noise that gets picked up by the microphone so you have to choose between shaky video (with image stabilization off) or loud audio in stable video... It's a known issue to this model.  Unfortunately there is no way to use an external microphone to get around that.The first generation of the onboard software misread the battery level when using rechargeable Lithium AA batteries.  I use Eneloop rechargeable AAs. The 1.1v software patch helps but it's still very conservative -  I get a handful of shots with the battery indicator in the green before it goes into \"orange\".  It does stay orange for a long time so battery life is pretty decent.I find the Noise Reduction in the camera produces blurry feathered edges.  It's better to turn off all NR settings (it's in a couple of places and it's defaulted to \"on\") and reduce noise after the fact using photo editing software.Small details - I wish the stock lens cap had a loop to attach a leash to it.  I bought an aftermarket 52mm lens cap that can be leashed so I can drop the cap and take a shot quickly without having to fuss with storing the cap or worrying about losing the cap.The overall design is user-friendly and comfortable to hold for a long time.I found the digital filters to be pretty toy-like and mucked up the menu system.Video mode is 720 HD maximum.  No 1080 res.  frame rate is locked at 24fps - which I actually like (it gives it a film-like feel) but would have been nice to have an option to set it to 30 fps too.I've enjoyed learning on this camera and I may try another lens to see if I can get a better image quality but if it doesn't help, I'll eventually be trading up to a better DSLR.", "Date": "August 27, 2010"}, {"Title": "Everything I expected", "Author": "Stephen Kruger", "ReviewID": "RR6Q65CVRKMXL", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I am well pleased with this camera.
