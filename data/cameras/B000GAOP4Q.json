Cannot take even acceptable pictures.  Also, does not come with an SD card, which is required.  And will only read a 1GB card or less.  Those are not available through most outlets any more.  Even the seller didn't carry them or have any idea where to get one.  Don't waste your money on this one.  Not even an acceptable childrens camera.", "Date": "March 8, 2013"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": "$99.99", "Features": "\u00bf3.2 Megapixels\n\u00bfCmos Sensor Picture Resolution\n\u00bfVideo Capture Function\n\u00bfWeb Camera Function\n4X Digital Zoom", "Name": "VUPOINT DC-C517-VP 5.0 Megapixel Digital Camera", "ImgURL": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/31Ka4PM9P4L._SY300_.jpg", "ProductID": "B000GAOP4Q"}}
