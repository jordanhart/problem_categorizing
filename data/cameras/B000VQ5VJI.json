I bought this at Wal-Mart, for $120, and it messed up, on the third day. I took the kids to the local Fair, and the camera froze, while still open... wouldn't close, wouldn't take pics. It has since done this, several times, and always right when I want to get the perfect shot. I have to take the batteries out, over and over, and push on the zoom part of it, and, eventually, it retracts, and will work, again... The screen also goes black, and the camera makes weird sounds. This is a well-taken-care-of camera, too, so it's not being dropped, or mishandled (except to get the darn zoom back into the camera!!). Another thing: the battery life is truly terrible... Be prepared to change them, VERY frequently, even though it will show you the symbols for full battery life... Suddenly it will tell you 'Low Battery' and it will die... I gave this 2 stars because it does take good pictures... when it finally works. It's slow, though. You're ready to snap, and it won't actually take until several seconds later, when everyone is blinking, or turning their head, by then.I love cameras, and I thought this would be a good one, but I wish I'd bought another Fuji Finepix. That was my first digital camera (4.0 megapixel), and I should have bought their Fuji Finepix 8.0 megapixel, to replace it. My Fuji worked GREAT, for over 2 years. This Samsung sucked, right from the get-go, and I'm more than disappointed that I spent my money on crap. Please don't make the same mistake...

We put in two new AA batteries and were able to take 2 pictures before the camera stated Low Battery. I then put in a set of Rechargeable batteries and got the same results. At one point we shut down the camera and then turned it back on. The Battery indicator showed 3 bars. We took one picture and the camera shut down stating Low Battery. The camera did not even close the lens. I contacted Samsung Customer Service at the number listed on their Web Site. I stated that I had sent them 2 emails and had not received a response. No comment from Customer Service on this. Then I stated what the problem was and told them that I had performed various tests with the batteries as well as changing the cameras settings for the different type of power. I was told that I would have to send the cameras in for service and it would take 14 days. I told them that this was unacceptable as the cmaeras never worked and now I have to pay for shipping and wait 14 days for the them to get it repaired. He stated that there was nothing he could do.My opinion is to look for another manufacturer since Samsung has some serious quality issues with their cameras.

So I expect them to last, maybe not the water that one encountered, but last just the same.I received this one as a gift in January. It is now April. I've owned it 4 months longer than I would have wished. At first it seemed fine. I was willing to live with the fact that it needs a lot of time to save photos. You can't just click away, but nurture and be patient with it while it thinks. I missed some great opportunities, but I was willing to live with it.Then came the fact that it wastes so many batteries. I'm a slightly heavy user, but I expect the batteries to last a week or let me take more than 30 pictures. But no. Sometimes you could trick it by turning the camera off, then on, then take a photo. But I can only get one out if it.I almost always got the little red hand on every photo...even those that weren't so bad, and this was annoying. Also the scene options are very limited.I am going back to being a faithful Kodak EasyShare person.

Finally on the third day after taking maybe 12 pics. It completely froze with the lens out and wouldn't do ANYTHING! Needless to say it went back to the store.

My five-year-old granddaughter is thrilled with it. I got a 1G memory disc so she could take all she wanted.

I have bought 4 S630 Samsungs and 3 S730 Samsungs (two black and this pink one) for 7 of my 8 grandchildren--the eighth is only a year old.  These models have built into the camera itself a variety of fun frames to put on photos, \"stickers\" to decorate them, baloons to make cartoons, special effects, etc. that gives them creative fun with their digital photos without having to transfer them to the computer first.  They really enjoy experimenting and having fun with their photos, and the results can be saved to the computer &/or printed just as the regular plain photos can.

After about four years and thousands of photos, my first Samsung (the very same product as this), had served its purpose well. The settings were still functioning, but at a slower rate and it became increasingly unreliable of \"getting that shot\". I was excited to find the exact camera on Amazon for $107 (w/shipping). The seller wrote in the description that the camera was new, and the only reason it was listed as \"like new\" was because there was a tear on the box.  Had I been smart, and being somewhat familiar with retail, I should have realized that the tear in the box was probably an indication that the item was a previous return because it was defective.  Regrettably, I did not test the camera when I received it in early February.  It was only when I was getting ready to use it for a party that I realized the camera was defective.  None of the settings worked.  Quite simply, the camera is worthless.  I contacted the seller after the alloted 30-day return, and as was his right, he refused (quite succinctly, btw) to accept it for an exchange or refund.  My biggest problem with this seller, and quite frankly my only problem with this seller, is that I am nearly certain this product was not tested before it was listed.  If it was, the seller has little to no knowledge of cameras -- even basic ones.  This camera is very user-friendly, provided it works.  All one needed to do was take a few test shots to find out that the camera was defective.  So, I'm going to share 50% of the blame with this seller -- I should have checked it immediately -- the seller probably would have honored the 30-day return policy.

Purchased it from Sears.  Actually, I ordered a different camera, and because it was backordered, Sears offered me this camera instead, which was better quality (more bells and whistles) than the one I ordered.  I noticed right away that the batteries would run out quickly.  I recommend Rayovac Hybrid rechargables, or any recharchables that are lithium ion batteries.  These can last for over an hour in the camera on a full charge.  I love the manual mode dial on the top, and the pictures are great!  Macro is not that great on this camera, but what can you expect from a non-professional camera?  I had the camera for about two years before it just died on me.  I put in brand new, fully charged rechargables, and what happens is the lens comes out but the screen doesn't come on.  Or, sometimes the lens comes out, the screen is blue, and then it turns off.  I tried to contact the official Samsung repair shop in my state of Illinois, figuring I would just drive there and have them repair it, even though my warranty was expired.  Well, the place I guess is out of business, as the phone number doesn't work!  I went to another camera repair place, who said it is probably an internal computer issue, and would be $80 to look at, about $160 to repair!  Well, since the camera was purchased for less, and newer cameras have more features, I will be looking into other cameras, and probably not a Samsung.

I got it on sale at Circuit City for less than $60, and it was worth every penny I spent and more. Like I commented on the other review, however, you NEED to get the right batteries for this camera or it will not meet your expectations. A pack of good quality 2000mAh or higher Nimh recheargeables should definitely do the trick. Alkalines will not last long at all, and for some reason they also cause the camera to freeze more often.The picture quality is superb for a 7.2 megapixel camera, even better than my 8.0 megapixel GE A835. I have uploaded a couple of pictures from my vacation in Jamaica to show what I am talking about.The S73 seems to be built very sturdily, while at the same time manages not to be too bulky, which can be an issue for cameras that use AA batteries.The only minor issues that I've had with it is that there is a slightly long 4-5 second delay before the flash goes off when taking pictures after the camera is first turned on, and the flash recycle time is sometimes pretty slow, so it can be annoying when trying to take quick action shots one after the other using flash.

Samsung warranty only pays for one (1) way shipping, so to use it you will have to pay for shipping (which cost me $5.60 using USPS).The problem with this camera is that it does not like regular batteries (I was using Energizer Alkaline).  You will need to purchase the expensive Lithium-Ion kind or similiar (Nickle-Cadium?) which cost substaintially more than their alkaline counterparts.  Since this camera requires more power to work, from more expensive batteries, the cost of ownership of this camera rises proportionately.  After reading the reviews here, the tech support for Samsung could have easily asked me to try the more expensive batteries seeing how it was such a common problem with this camera--or at least their own tech-support site could have listed it more precisely.  I really feel cheated by purchasing this camera because it was simply misleading to claim it runs on regular AA batteries when it fact it doesn't.  How would you feel if you bought a car and later found out the car doesn't even turn on unless you put in 100octane gasoline (race-fuel) which is not only more expensive to buy but hard to come by?I don't recommend this camera what-so-ever to anybody for any reason.

Great pictures, and the camera is working with a battery life that you would expect.This is a great little camera, but you MUST use rechargeable batteries with a high capacity!", "Date": "November 30, 2008"}, {"Title": "Wonderful Photos", "Author": "Ashley M.
