It is REALLY easy to use...I was pretty much off and running as soon as I got the battery charged up...no need to figure out how to work it.  Having used another digital point and shoot, it was intuitive.  It is a durable and classy looking little thing and with its smooth edges, it fits nicely in a pocket.  The only thing I don't like about it is there is no obvious \"hand hold\" area.  Although I haven't dropped it, I am certain to keep the strap around my wrist as it feels like I could easily drop it while taking a picture.I'm quite happy with the quality of the images, both with and without the flash...keeping in mind that any small camera like this will have limited flash capabilities.  This is a really nice basic camera, especially at the current Amazon price.  I've put a wraparound cover on mine to protect it and I keep it in my purse or in the car all the time to catch those spur-of-the moment shots.", "Date": "August 25, 2011"}, {"Title": "Excellent value-packed easy-to-use camera that is great for a novice first-timer.", "Author": "\u0083\u016f\u008e\u017a\u0178 \u03c9\u016c", "ReviewID": "R3H80W0FOQBSZX", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": null, "Date": "July 31, 2011"}, {"Title": "Lasted less than a year", "Author": "Robin", "ReviewID": "R2CRMRZQJMFLPM", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "It got something on the sensor in the lens and progressively got worse.

I bought this for my daughter for her 7th birthday and she loves it. I managed to explore the camera a little bit. Basically, you do get a lot for the money:* Very compact* Pretty good battery life* easy to use* reasonably fast* most important: good quality pics in most 'common' conditions* many preset scene modes* nice face detection capabilities* light and stylish. My daughter's is purple.things I did not like so much:* 'intelligent auto' mode sometimes is not that intelligent... many times just using 'auto' mode or selecting the right scene mode is better. It is tempting to use 'iA' though because it really does all the settings for you - a true point and shoot. However using 'auto' will get you there in most situations.* no manual controls at all* 'sunset' scene mode did not produce good sunset pictures. However, the 'iA' mode did a lot better.* macro capabilities are pretty good but I would expect better from a compact camera. This camera does not have a 'close up' or similar scene that I've noticed.Overall - if you need a camera for that budget, i recommend. I have a Nikon L22 and I personally prefer the Panasonic.

We wanted a smaller camera we could just stick in a pocket for those times we just wanted to snap some casual pictures and/or we didn't want to lug the larger camera with us.  This camera is great for that.I took it out of the box, charged the battery, and put it together to take with me.  The pictures it took were good quality; I was surprised how good they were. There was no blurriness and, as another review mentions, there seemed to be no lag between when I pressed the button and when the pictures were taken.  The buttons were intuitive and I was able to move through the different functions easily.  I loaded the software that came in the box onto my computer.

It is lightweight, easy to use, and takes great pictures. I took this camera on a vacation to San Diego, and nearly all of my pictures turned out great. I used the iA (intelligent auto) mode most of the time--when set on this mode, the camera automatically chooses the correct settings for your picture. There are also several scene settings to choose from if you don't want to use iA mode. The only time I really used a scene setting was at the beach; otherwise, the iA mode worked wonderfully. The optical image stabilizer is one of my favorite features. It automatically compensates for shaky hands and allowed me to get incredibly clear pictures. This camera is leaps and bounds better than my previous camera, a 9.0 megapixel Fujifilm FinePix, and it's pretty cheap, too!A word about the software (and this is what keeps me from giving the camera 5 stars): I installed the PHOTOfunSTUDIO editing software that comes with the camera and then promptly uninstalled it. The features are similar to those in Picasa, but it wasn't as easy to use, and the program ran very slowly on my machine, which has plenty of memory and runs Windows 7.  I wouldn't recommend using the editing software--stick with Picasa or even Microsoft Office Picture Manager!", "Date": "June 21, 2011"}, {"Title": "Good starter camera", "Author": "Tiffany A. Harkleroad \"Tiffanys Bookshelf\"", "ReviewID": "R1O7RER6TK5AIE", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "This week, I received a camera to review.  The camera is Panasonic Lumix.  The camera is nice and compact, and fits into the palm of your hand.I really liked the look and feel of the camera.  There is something to be said about a nice compact camera.  It is nice and light, a great camera to throw in your purse or bag.In terms of the camera itself, there are some really nice features.  The scene mode has more scene options than most of the cameras I have had in the past, including special settings for snow, fireworks, and food as well as the standard modes like portrait, scenery, and sports.  The menus and settings seem fairly easy to use.One thing important to note is that while there is a place to control the exposure, I do not think there is a way to control the shutter speed, ISP, or f stop, so this is a very basic camera.  This makes it a great starter camera, or a nice camera for young adults.There is 70 MB of built in memory, which is nice if you forget to load a memory card; you can still store a few pictures or some video in the internal memory.  I like this feature, because I have, in the past, forgotten to put my memory card back in the camera, and lost photo opportunities as a result.The quality of the photos is not bad for as 14.1 MP camera, but for someone used to a more powerful point and shoot, like I am, the images can seem a little fuzzy, even with the image stabilizer.  Close up photos are fairly good, but the zoomed pictures are not as clear as I would like.The same pretty much applies for the video quality.  Good for the level of camera, but not as good as I would prefer.One thing I am totally unimpressed with is the software that comes with the camera.  It did not install easily, and some components would not install at all, so I did not get to mess with the software much.  What I did see of it, however, did not impress me at all.  I will not use the software, and will instead continue storing photos on my external hard drive, and using other programs to edit and upload.So overall, a nice little camera for casual picture takers, beginners, or teenagers.

Panasonic DMC-S3 camera.  I purchased my white S3 at Costco for under 100 dollars, and the Costco bundle came with a very nice case and a Transcend 2GB SD memory card.  The S3's own box included a LiIon battery pack, a one-piece battery charger (no cord needed), a hand strap, a USB cable, and the software CD-ROM.The S3 weighs 4 oz. with battery and card and is what we used to call an idiot-proof camera. It has only 4 shooting modes: Panasonic's famous iA (intelligent auto) mode, which is simply the best automatic scene-dependent shooting mode on the compact digital camera market today, a normal mode that is similar to the program mode on other digital cameras, a scene mode that lets you pick from 16 presets (including high sensitivity, sports, portrait, baby, etc.), and a camcorder mode that shoots video in Quicktime format at 1280x720, 640x480 (VGA) or 320x240 (QVGA) resolutions. BTW, unlike more expensive Panasonic cameras, the S3 cannot zoom while shooting video, a pity.The S3 comes in several colors; mine is white and looks very stylish.  It feels good and light in the hand, although I also think it feels almost like a toy, but not in a bad way.  The plastic casing seems durable (and fingerprint-friendly), and the buttons are all solid and easy to press.Unlike other digicams in this price range or even more expensive, the S3 exhibits little shutter lag, that is, as soon as you press the shutter button, it takes the picture (unless it's really dark in the room). The S3 takes excellent outdoor pictures, with excellent color accuracy and contrast and good focus.  Indoors, most of the no-flash pictures I have taken of my kids look good, but understandably the digital noise is higher.  Indoor flash photography is not something I'd call good on any compact digital camera, including this one, although the flash does make a good fill-in flash outdoors when the subject's face has shadows.Overall, I find the S3 *very* pleasant to use.  Its good performance in shutter lag and excellent outdoor picture quality and good indoor quality make it a winner for a low-cost, no-brainer take-it-anywhere camera.", "Date": "July 15, 2011"}, {"Title": "Decent Camera for Pointing and Shooting Only", "Author": "Jennifer", "ReviewID": "R1MR0YUPXTSKCK", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "The last camera that I owned was a 35mm, and I was about 12 years old. I was in need of a camera for a trip to Los Angeles, where I would need to document some of the people, places, and things I would see while there. This camera seemed ideal to me because I didn't have a lot of time to learn how to use a camera, and I was under the impression that all that mattered was simply pointing and shooting.The camera arrived, and I immediately charged the battery so that I could start playing around with it and getting accustomed to it before I left for my trip. The battery charges in about 2 hour and I happily started snapping away, at first pleased with the pictures I was taking.We have an extra memory card that I have been using with my camera, and it is really simple to move the pictures from the memory card to iPhoto so that I can upload them on facebook or in an online photo album. One day on my trip, I actually forgot to put my memory card into my camera and was unaware that the pictures were going directly onto the camera's memory. After taking what seemed like no more than 10-15 pictures, I was informed that my memory was full and that I could not take anymore pictures. I really wish that the camera's memory could hold more pictures than it does.The cable that comes with the camera was also easy to use so that I could then move the pictures stored in the camera's memory into iPhoto. Everything about the operation of the camera is simplistic, and I think it would be a fine camera for someone who wants to do little more than upload pictures onto facebook or Twitter. It would also be a good learning camera for teenagers or young adults interested in photography to decide if this is a hobby worth pursuing.I really started to see the difference with the quality of the pictures this camera could take when I compared my photos to others that were taken with higher end cameras. My photos came out grainy and with really bright spots, whereas photos taken by my peers on this trip came out with perfect color balance and clarity.I don't have an interest in pursuing photography like my husband does, but overall this camera takes care of photos I might decide to snap during the daytime. I've been disappointed with its ability in capturing nighttime images, but will expand my knowledge of photography and how this camera operates and see if I can find a happy balance.", "Date": "June 28, 2011"}, {"Title": "Panasonic Lumix", "Author": "Ferdy", "ReviewID": "R3OLKAZN6VX7SB", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "This camera is very light weight and easy to use.

I started using it immediately and I am very impressed by the picture quality.  The camera feels good in the hand and the controls are well placed.  A few things hit me right away.  First, you must remove the battery from the camera and place it in a charger then plug it into the wall.  This is a little inconvenient as most cameras allow you to leave the battery in the camera while charging.  Second, There's only one 16 X 9 format that you can choose.  It's 10 MB which is fine but why would they make a camera with like a dozen 4 X 3 modes and only one 16 X 9.  Everyone wants to see their pics on a widescreen TV and not a 4 X 3.  This really surprised me.  Third, the camera has a cheap plastic feel to it.  The body is a shiny plastic black finish which feels not as strong.  Otherwise, the pics are good and it is very small and light.", "Date": "December 27, 2011"}, {"Title": "Great little camera; great value", "Author": "CJ-MO", "ReviewID": "R37M2FIVVON5EP", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This model of the Panasonic Lumix is a great camera for the type and price-range. Panasonic is a reliable brand, which I appreciate for electronic items. The online photo of the camera itself doesn't do it justice. It is has a glossy black color with silver trim that looks very nice. The camera is small, lightweight, and convenient to carry around. It's a good alternative to a cell phone camera when you want features such as a better zoom capability or a flash.One feature I really like is it comes with a rechargeable lithium ion battery and a well accessory for use in charging. A light will come on to let you know it's plugged in correctly and charging. It takes about two hours to fully charge.The camera comes with a small, 20 page owner's manual highlighting the basic features. Detailed instructions are included on a DVD. It's a simple point and shoot camera, so as soon as the battery charged, I was able to take pictures right away.Software is included to download and edit photos, but I was able to use the standard software included in Windows to handle my photos. If you take a photo and immediately decide you don't like it after viewing on the screen, you can hit the convenient \"trash can\" button on the front of the camera to delete it in one step. I also like how easy it is to switch from \"playback\" to \"picture taking\" mode.The quality of the photos are great for online use. Printed photos look good as well. There aren't a lot of special features, but for a highly portable camera that is easy to use, this is a great choice.", "Date": "June 5, 2011"}, {"Title": "Hilarious: Instruction leaflets not in English!", "Author": "E.

For more important stuff - vacations, memories etc. personally I would go for something a bit better. I heard great things about higher end Panasonic with Leica lens.

She was thrilled, and it was a very easy-to-use camera with easy-to-use features, and a great value.  She figured out how to do a slide show all by herself.  Then my 5-year-old son stepped on it once, on the carpet no less, and now the top corner of the screen (about a one-inch area) is messed up.  It is still usable, but we are saddened that she has to put up with that, at least until we get her another one.", "Date": "March 18, 2012"}, {"Title": "Panasonic Lumix DMC-S3 Camera", "Author": "R.

This is the same as not getting an instruction booklet at all!  In addition, the warranty, oddly, which was in English, did not cover the camera if purchased in the United States, which is where I happen to live.  Why this camera would be sent to a U.S. buyer and user is totally beyond me.  With an instruction book in a foreign language, it is useless to me, so I have returned it and I am extremely disappointed about the whole thing.", "Date": "December 4, 2011"}, {"Title": "broke when dropped two feet", "Author": "Michelle D.

It landed on it's side on concrete and gave an error message when I turned it on. I have a Sony that is six years old that has been dropped dozens of times and still works fine. I can't rate any of the features as I barely had time to play with it. I did take a couple of pictures of moving fish at Monterey Aquarium that turned out nicely. The camera is very slippery and in my husband's opinion, way too small.
