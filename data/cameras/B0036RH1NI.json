I already own a Samsung NV15 10mp camera, which takes very nice pictures, but this one is even better.  I went for the gray version as I liked the look of it.  The touch display is very sharp and easy to use.  The 14mp sensor and high quality lens combine to take excellent images.  This camera is loaded with features.  My only complaint is that it uses a microSD card instead of a standard SD card.  Not a big deal though.  I got an 8gb Sandisk microsd card for 25 bucks and it holds over 900 photos at the highest resolution setting, and came with a standard SD adapter for loading the images into my mac. I like the small size of this camera.  We travel a lot and this is a perfect travel camera, pocket size, decent 7x zoom and easy to use settings.  If you use the Smart setting, you just point and shoot and the camera evaluates the scene and chooses the best setting, and it seems to work great.  If you are looking for a nice quality camera, give this one a look.", "Date": "August 24, 2010"}, {"Title": "A Grand Addition", "Author": "Norman N.

Don't use Macro.One great feature that outshines our Fuji is the menu items can be tucked out of the way so as not obscure screen with clutter.If I break this one (I seem to destroy one-per-year) I'm confident another will replace it.", "Date": "November 16, 2010"}, {"Title": "only takes good photos without flash on", "Author": "Amy White", "ReviewID": "R39QRMU53ABYRL", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "it is not a bad camera. however... when taking photos with the flash there is an awful shadow behind subjects. sometimes the camera will not turn on and freezes during use. takes good photos outside and without the flash. touchscreen is nice but my S3 takes better photos. video is pretty decent.", "Date": "November 24, 2013"}, {"Title": "No good", "Author": "Judy Weaver", "ReviewID": "RQ71L02R62UC0", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "This is not a good camera.

Only major grip, not limited to this camera, is that photographs in full daylight literally are impossible to compose due to refraction on the LCD display.Took it to Panama rather than haul around my D300. Perhaps it was rather too small. Slipped from my pocket when squatting, awaiting a bus.
