It's small, light, easy to learn and use. I got about 100 pictures off of the provided 2 alkaline AA's, but I bought some good NiMh rechargeable batteries for going forward.It has many fancy post-processing features that I choose not to use. I favor ThumbsPlus or GImP.I only ding it for no optical zoom. It's a good deal for the price (as of mid-2006).", "Date": "September 27, 2006"}, {"Title": "Simple camera to use.", "Author": "Gerald Balmes \"Jerry B\"", "ReviewID": "R30GJ1P2F2KYB", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This is a fantastic that takes excellent pictures.
