And it has a lot of modes that I haven't figured out yet. It takes fantastic photos in it's automatic mode.  Last night we were on a sunset cruise and I chose it's \"twilight mode\". A quick snap and a bit of a wait for processing and voila, a great (but not quite accurate) shot of the sky.  Similarly shots of the town of Rovinj (in Croatia).", "Date": "August 2, 2013"}, {"Title": "as advertised, no problems", "Author": "Mike \"Mike\"", "ReviewID": "R1PEXACYR8L1WJ", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Genuine article, lots of accessories, quick delivery.

The only negative side I have found thus far is the processing time between shots!  It seems to take forever.  I travel constantly and have gotten good at taking photos while moving in a vehicle or on a train, so processing time can mean missing good shots.  I'm still learning with this camera though, and might find a way to change that!  Otherwise, it seems to be a really great camera with beautiful resulting photos!  pocket size, pretty light weight, large LCD screen and seemingly easy controls and menu choices.  What's not to like????", "Date": "December 2, 2013"}, {"Title": "Glad we got the bundle.", "Author": "Bill", "ReviewID": "RS21NHHZMK2RZ", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "The mini tripod didn't look like much but was the first accessory we reached for - very useful.

Only had the chance to take picks @ night w/ low light & I must say it takes nice pics even w/o using the editing capabilities of the camera. I've yet to explore all it has to offer, including the video, but I must say I'm pleased thus far.

We could not see anything in the display so we did not know what our picture would look like.  The pictures were poor quality and had dark edges.  The camera finally quit working and told us to turn off and turn it back on. It still did not work and that same message continued to appear.  We are going to try to return it.  It came through another vendor besides Amazon so we are not sure how this will go.
