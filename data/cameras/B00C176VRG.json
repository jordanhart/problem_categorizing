Romeis \"Dood\"", "ReviewID": "R1X6XZHT255HQA", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Last week Tuesday, as I packed and prepared to travel out of state for a family reunion, my concentration, which had been devoted to deciding which outfits would best withstand the brutal Texas heat and upwards of 80% humidity levels, was broken by the buzzing of my apartment's intercom.  \"Hello,\" I said, as I held down the 'speak' button and spoke into the intercom system.  \"Delivery,\" said the FedEx delivery man.  I buzzed him in, as I was expecting a delivery.  A Samsung Galaxy Camera had arrived, conveniently in time for the trip I was about to take, where many pictures would be taken, and where the planned taking of group photographs would become a reality.What an opportunity had presented itself to test the Samsung Galaxy EK-GC120 Camera.Firstly, let me clear up any misconception you may have that I am a professional photographer; I am not, but the Samsung Galaxy Camera is fun to use and has piqued my interest.  What did stick in my mind, though, were comments made from a family friend who came over specifically to take the group photos.  As she aimed with the Galaxy Camera to shoot for me while I stood in the picture, I noticed she came closer to our group than she did with the other cameras.  \"This camera is awesome,\" she said. \"I was able to get up real close to the group and still fit everyone in.\"It should appeal to recreational users, like myself, as well as those more well-versed in the art of photography.  It offers users 'auto', 'smart mode', and 'expert' options.  Expert mode allows for the fine-tuning of things like aperture, brightness, shutter speed and resolution;  all done via a nifty digitally-displayed lens.If you enjoy taking pictures of your food, choose the 'food' option in 'smart mode' to bring out the  vivid colors of your entree.  'Continuous shot', another option in 'smart mode', allows the photographer to take up to 20 pictures, continuously, at a rate of 4 per second.  There is a 'mode' available for pretty much any particular situation; whether capturing minute details in close-up shots is of interest, or it's simply bringing out your subject's best toothy grins in those group shots.The only problem you'll face, then, is choosing whether to encapsulate how the leafy green kale contrasts that blackened steak sitting atop the bright white plate, emphasize the best portraits of all those gathered around the table, freeze the action of the bartender in the background juggling bottles, or take twenty pictures at a rate of 4 pictures per second; the choice is yours, my friend.Regarding the specs; it's basically a top-notch camera: 16 megapixels, 21x optical zoom lens (23mm~483mm) with optical image stabilization, that doubles as a smart device by operating on the familiar, intuitive user-interface, Android(tm) 4.1, Jelly Bean platform--I can do most things on this device that I would with the Galaxy Note(with the exception of the S pen, of course) or my S3.  The Galaxy Camera doesn't offer phone service, but for those who'd like a smartphone with a similarly amazing camera, the Galaxy S4 Zoom Smartphone will have a 16 megapixel camera.  This phone releases July 8th.  Everything on the Galaxy Camera is displayed beautifully on the 4.8\" HD Super Clear Touch Screen LCD.  If you'd like to take and watch videos you'll enjoy the 1280 x 720 Pixel resolution.  Don't worry about running out of storage space because the device supplies 8GB of internal memory and the option to add 64GB of external memory.Since this shooter is connected to Verizon's high speed 4G LTE network and packed with advanced share features, anything you capture can be instantly shared on the web, sent to other devices and accessed from any AllShare\u00ae Play device.I would recommend this to anyone; it's a fun device and takes great photos.http://www.examiner.com/review/samsung-galaxy-camera-professional-photos-shared-on-4g-lte", "Date": "July 26, 2013"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": "$549.99", "Features": "Verizon Android 4.1.2 (Jellybean)\n4.8\" AMOLED Display\n1080p HD Video", "Name": "Samsung Galaxy Camera 16 MP EK-GC120VRAMC4, 21 x OpticalZoom, 23mm Wide Zoom Lens, Android(TM) 4.1, Jelly Bean", "ImgURL": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51PF8A4ogrL._SY300_.jpg", "ProductID": "B00C176VRG"}}
