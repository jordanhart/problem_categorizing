This tripod adapter works well: it slips over the body of the camera and is locked in place by the tripod mounting screw.  In my opinion a tripod mount should have been built into the camera from the outset.I see two problems with this:1. It is not clear where on the camera it should be placed.  My Lytro now has small scratches in the finish from this adapter - might not have happened if the adapter was placed on the rubber grip, but this would have been a tight fit (if it was even possible).  No instruction sheet to suggest placement.2. I am concerned about possibly damaging the internals of the camera when I tighten the tripod mounting screw.  Again, some instructions - suggesting either where to place the adapter or assuring me that damage would not occur - would have been welcome.Considering that this is the only way to use the Lytro with a tripod, it is hard not to rate it highly.", "Date": "November 16, 2012"}, {"Title": "good engineering", "Author": "tergiam", "ReviewID": "RUE2PKKGFUAI4", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Works just the way it's supposed to.  The method of clamping on to the camera body is new to me and it works very well.  Care must be excercised to not use too long a thumb screw.  If your thumb screws are too long, shim them with washer(s). You only want  about three and a half threads to engage the clamping mechanism nut.", "Date": "December 9, 2012"}, {"Title": "Interesting accessory to attach the camera to a tripod.", "Author": "Jauvane C. de Oliveira \"JVc\"", "ReviewID": "R1LR8TLQOQ4NK5", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This is a must have if you wish to use your Lytro camera in a tripod or other accessory that uses the same tripod mount.

All in all, it's disappointing that the camera doesn't come with the 1/4-20 mounting hole in it like just about every other camera ever made. I look at it as a form of forced upgrade from Lytro....", "Date": "January 28, 2013"}, {"Title": "Beautiful.", "Author": "G.
