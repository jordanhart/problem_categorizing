Sweet", "ReviewID": "R1YMC60HA4590U", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Update:  Images up to ISO 51,200 have very acceptable levels of noise (very little).  Worst case, I touched up with Dfine 2.0 (noise reduction software) and they look nearly perfect.  I experimented with the movie mode.  The camera took some very nice looking videos in extremely low light.  I don't know what ISO it used, but it must be hitting ISO 102,400 at times.  The video and sound using the internal microphone are really good.  I may add an external stereo mic in the future if I shoot video.  I should have known, you can't shoot movies in vertical format -- of course -- but I did take some that way before I realized that format doesn't work when you play back on a TV.I've now got a growing collection of images in various conditions and remain extremely pleased with this camera.-----------------I received my new Nikon D3S only a couple of days ago, and my early testing of this camera has already proven it to be much more than I expected.  I took a few dozen test shots in nearly complete darkness and with relatively little noise the shots look like they were taken in fairly bright lighting.  I am very impressed.  In fact, I would even say they are unbelievable.I love the new \"info\" button.  I passed over the written material before the camera arrived thinking: who cares.  Well, I find it to be an extremely helpful feature.  When you press the \"info\" button, it shows not only the exposure settings, but gives you immediate access to several of the relevant menu options that you can then immediately access and make changes.  I find this to be very quick and useful.The D3S seems a bit bigger than my Nikon D2Xs and other professional bodies I use, but it feels like it's built absolutely solid.  Of course, since the D3S is an FX (full frame) sensor, I have heavier lenses attached and in my bag too.  I love the D3S ergonomics and the programmable function and other buttons (programmable AE/AL and Preview button).  I hate to fumble with menus in the field (sorry Canon 1ds Mark III and 5D Mark IV and others, but Nikon has you beat here), and the Nikon gives fast access to all the key settings.I haven't done extensive image tests yet, but my first impression is the images are superb, color is very accurate and auto focus is very fast and accurate, even in what I'd call \"no light.\"  I have usable images at ISO 102,400 (an amazing seven full stops better than other pro-bodies I use).  At this point, I still can't believe how good images look at ISO 102,400, and images at ISO 51,200 and 25,600 look nearly perfect with either no high ISO NR (noise reduction) or standard NR.Looking at my images at high magnification and they appear much clearer than even higher megapixel resolution bodies I use.  I am now finally convinced beyond any doubt that megapixel is more of a marketing ploy than meaningful for professional photographers and other factors are more important.As a pro who uses high end digital bodies, this is my first choice (maybe my only choice) for most assignments.  I do a fair amount of studio work and thought I might opt for the Nikon D3X or even a Canon body since high ISO is not important, but this camera is so good I may use it for all my photography work in all conditions.  If I really need high-end studio shots, I'll perhaps use my Mamiya with a digital back or even rent a Hasselblad.", "Date": "December 10, 2009"}, {"Title": "Amazing low light camera", "Author": "R. Adams \"Via Corsa Car Lover's Guidebooks\"", "ReviewID": "RELX5VW36PWH3", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "The Nikon D3s is an amazing camera and I love it. The vast majority of people looking at buying this camera are talking about it's ISO and low light abilities. Even though there is alot more to this camera than it's amazing new ISO abilities, lets start with it's most unique feature and major selling point.How good does it's ISO get? How about 12,800! The ISO can be pushed up to 102,400 using the Hi ISO settings.My tests - Nikon D3s combined with the Nikkor 24-70 2.8 Lens.I tested the camera at 400 ISO, 800 ISO, 1,600 ISO, 3,200 ISO, 6,400 ISO, and 12,800 ISO both inside in low light and outside at night. I have also tested the Hi 3 or 102,400 ISO settingThe ISO settings look really great up through the 3,200 mark. After that one can a little notice grain/noise up to the 12,800 ISO point. I would not hesitate at all running this camera at 1,600 or 3,200 ISO. BTW - Pictures taken at 12,800 are usable. They look really good. But there is a little noise as I said. The 102,400 setting creates all sorts of noise/grain, but that should be expected. So far the pictures I've take at the highest setting basically turns this camera into your own \"night vision\" camera. It can see in very dark surroundings.More on the D3s-  This camera is rugged. Over the holidays, I had it outside in snow storms, rain, and sub freezing temperatures. It performed flawlessly.- Info button - New to the D3s and really nice. It displays information such as f-stop, shutter speed, mode, and remaining pictures on monitor/display screen on the back-  Live view - there are 2 setting here. One for a tripod and one for handheld use. Turn this on, and you have a view of what you see through the viewfinder on your back monitor. I personally don't use this alot, but can see why others would.- Accurate and fast auto focus using the 24-70 2.8 lens and my 14-24 2.8 lens- HD Video at 720p- Amazing 9 fps. Yes, I tested this, and I love it. I shoot motorsports and was hampered by the slower D2Xs as well as the smaller buffer on the D2Xs- Sensor cleaning - done through the menu system on the back monitor.- Quiet mode (Which isn't that much quieter than the default sound)- 51 point Auto Focus system- FX metering system (remember if you use a DX lens on this camera, the FX sensor with crop your photo. It appears like a gray box inside the vewfinder cropping your edges)My Favorite addition (actually useful and I love it) - The Virtual Horizon. This looks like something you would find in the cockpit of an airplane and not a camera, but here it is in the D3s. It is a line that gives the photographer the correct horizon. Why is this so cool? Imagine anything from nature photography in the mountains (like standing on a slope) to photographing motorsports on a banked oval track (that would be me). Here is the function that allows photos to have proper alignment. I could see this function being used both on a tripod and hand held.*Update on pictures*- Having spent more time photographing in low light, the 12,800 ISO setting is mind blowing.- Pictures outside at night - I took pictures of dark lawns, streets, and some holiday lights. Contrast is good as is saturation. There is some grain/noise, but it is uniform and not that bad.- Pictures in dimly lit rooms - less noise and the colors and saturation are great. These images were sharp too. I toggled between manual mode and program mode to fool with the depth of field and bokeh. The brighter the room, the less the noise/grain. (Again these are ALL situations that would have required a flash with any other camera)- Pictures of stars - Yup. Stars in the sky. I was actually able to hand hold this camera, aim it in the sky and snap a picture of stars. The picture didn't look that great, but considering I did it on a whim it was still really neat. (The camera picked up alot of haze in the sky. I think away from the city, the photos would be a lot better)I've now taken well over 1,000 pictures with the D3s and it is easily the best camera I have owned. I am really impressed---------------------------Update on one D3s issue - DPreview forums have reported numerous instances of D3s with a slow focus problem. They say it is a firmware bug. I have NOT had any issues and I am 2,000+ photos into my D3s. That includes many lowlight shoots.", "Date": "December 14, 2009"}, {"Title": "I love this camera!", "Author": "Bernhard J. Gaarsoe", "ReviewID": "R1AEAVU4UI9WZ0", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I initially started this comment as a reply to someone who asked why anyone would need a camera that goes higher than 12,000 ISO unless you wanted to take pictures in a closet, especially since you can get a much less expensive consumer-level DSLR with more mega pixels and higher resolution video.  I decided to post my response here with the hope than someone else might find it to be useful:For the past couple of years, I have been using a Nikon D80, which from all the reviews I have read competes fairly well with other cameras in this class.  I am not a professional photographer, but I enjoy photography enough that the limitations this consumer-level DSLR seems to have became a source of frustration to me.I recently upgraded to a D3S, and I am absolutely amazed at the difference between the two cameras.  The D3S is ten times the camera--and not because of the marginal difference in mega pixels.It's not all about being able to take pictures in near darkness either.  I take a lot of wildlife pictures with a solid, f 4.5 70-300mm zoom lens (popular because of its good price/performance tradeoff), and with my D80, if I am zoom out much at all, it has to be a bright sunny day to get really good pictures.  Cloud cover and even shade results in quite a bit of color noise and a loss of detail, even at ISO settings as low as 400, and I almost always have to shoot with the aperture wide open to mitigate these problems, which, of course, limits my flexibility in terms of depth of field and tends to wash out bright areas.  It is also very difficult to stop the motion of things like birds in flight with the low ISO settings that are required to avoid color noise and loss of detail.  This is a very frustrating tradeoff to have to make.With my D80, I have also noticed that the shading gradation of things like fog and shadows in snow is fairly limited--to the point where pictures of things with subtle shading almost always look washed out or have very little detail.  The D3S, on the other hand, has an amazing amount of detail no matter what the subject is, no matter how subtle the shading and despite poor lighting conditions.  (For the first time ever, I have been able to take pictures of things like fog rolling over a lake and have it show up just the way my eyes see it!  No more blending of subtle shades into a single patch of white.)My D80 also struggles to be consistent with color balance and metering.  The D3S is almost always dead on in terms of color balance and metering and is faster and more consistently accurate with its auto focus.The fact that the D3S's image sensor does such a great job in low light situations has opened up new possibilities for me.  I can even stop down my slow f 4.5 300mm zoom lens significantly at any focal length and get outstanding results, even on a cloudy day.  Think about the possibilities this opens up in terms of lens choices.  As an amateur, I simply cannot afford the 10K-a-pop, fast professional lenses, but now I can get great pictures with slower, less expensive lenses, and I can actually extend the capabilities of the lenses I have with things like teleconverters and still get good results.  In this sense, the D3S is a bargain.I have mostly mentioned the quality of the pictures this camera takes, and I do not intend to go into its rich feature set and build quality (other comments below have already done this), but I did want to tell you about some of the considerable advantages I have found with the D3S and tell you about the outstanding results that I have been getting.  I am amazed at the quality of the pictures this camera takes, and I am thrilled with the way this camera performs!  This camera is in an entirely different class than the consumer-level DSLRs I have used in the past.", "Date": "January 21, 2010"}, {"Title": "Just amazing", "Author": "JM \"Cowboy\"", "ReviewID": "R3BXAUTRV4JB66", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Having shot with Canon for the last 15 yrs, moving over to Nikon was not an easy decision. I had a decent collection of lenses and the 1D Mark II was beginning to show its age. The mark III had its issues and the mark IV had shown promise.Many friends asked why switch now? Simply put, low light is where I shoot most of my jobs. Nikon at the moment has the advantage. Selling my Canon gear was the big question. I ended up selling ALL my gear (1D Mark II, 135L, 28-70L, 70-200L IS, 35L, 85, 100 macro, and 580EX) in 1 week CASH... It covered the D3s, 24-70, and most of the 70-200 VRII.While I waited for my gear to sell, I rented the D3s for a week along with Nikon's recent additions -- 14-24, 24-70, and 70-200 VR II. The images from the D3s with the aforementioned lenses were quite simply just amazingly sharp with minimal noise.One can read the many reviews of the D3s out there.Here's what impressed me about the D3s:1. Ergonomics -- well designed button placements, easy to nagigate menus, buttons for metering/shooting speed/autofocus.2. Image quality -- AMAZING images at high ISO. Check out Rob Galbraith's images.3. 9 fps full sized RAW files/11 fps DX files4. Screen size (a big change from my 1D Mark II)5. Autofocus is stellar even in low light. I've not had issues like others have described.6. I like 2CF cards vs 1 CF and 1 SD. Using Photofast Plus 32GB ($250) and no problems.7. self cleaning sensorOther things that impressed me about Nikon:1. 5 year lens warranty vs Canon's 1 year2. 24-70 images are sharper than my 28-70 Canon3. 70-200 VRII images better than my Canon 2.8L ISSuggestions for improvment:1. selection of autofocus point with the back button. I think Canon's method appeals to me better.2. Battery life is not the 4000 shots as advertised. Not sure if these are done with jpeg images, but I gotten ~ 1500 shots with 14 bit RAW images, a fair amount of chimping, and occasional video.3. Focusing on video mode needs improvement. Its clunky and slow.4. Video -- meh...great in a pinch, but its not a high priority for me. Others I'm sure feel differently. Canon's got the upper hand for now.I like the direction that Nikon has choosen. Image quality over megapixels. Its a balanced camera with more than enough features for me. If you do advertising or need high resolution, the D3x is for you. This is a professional camera inside and out. Its worth every penny I've put out for the body and Nikon's lenses. I have no regrets!---------------------------Update Dec 22, 2010:The D3s continues to impress. Took it to the Billabong Pipeline Masters surf competition a few weeks ago. Pared with the 200-400 VR, I was able to get some fantastic images. If I could do things better the \"next\" time, I'd take a 500 or 600 VR. AF was spot on tracking was not a problem in the least.Auto ISO has been a hidden surprise when I moved to Nikon. My 1D Mark II didn't have it, but the new Canon models do. I like Nikon's version as it allows me to be in manual mode (allows me to set the shutter and aperture) and the ISO changes to keep the SS and aperture fixed. It allows me to control DOF and stopping motion in sports! This allows me to focus on composition and being a photographer rather than on the technical aspects.", "Date": "February 9, 2010"}, {"Title": "Love it", "Author": "David Johnson", "ReviewID": "R2N4WUV3O17Q3M", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I have had my D3s a week and have already shot over 500 photos.

It was a natural extension for me since I have always used Nikon.

Bernard \"//Chuck\"", "ReviewID": "R2KH7XSMDJPPOS", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I was using a Canon 5D Mark II camera for over a year but became more and more disappointed with it as time went on. The focusing system used on the Canon was poor and the high ISO was good but not great.Finally tiring of the soft focus of the 5D Mark II, I decided to either upgrade to the 1D Mark IV or the Nikon D3S. The decision was a very painful one to make and I dwelled on the subject for weeks before making a decision.I finally decided on the Nikon D3S because of its full frame sensor and how its relatively large pixel size would be an advantage in low light situations (i.e., High ISO). Also, it didn't hurt that it was available right away through Amazon and I needed it for my trip to Europe at the end of December.Now, after having used the Nikon D3S for around 2 months in a variety of situations I can say without hesitation that this is the finest DSLR available. Its ability to shoot sports action in low light is stunning and the focus is very responsive and always spot on! The lenses which I have purchased have all been superior to their Canon equivalent counterparts. Although, the Nikon does have some wholes in their lineup, most notably the the 85mm f/1.2.While I believe that the filming features of the 1D Mark IV are likely superior it was a mute point for me after a year of experiences with the 5d Mark II. Unless you are very serious you will not get good results filming with any DSLR so I did not consider this when deciding which camera to buy.In conclusion, I was very nervous about buying the Nikon D3S instead of the Canon 1D Mark IV. However, after using the D3S in a variety of situations I have absolutely fallen in love with this camera.", "Date": "February 8, 2010"}, {"Title": "Very responsive. Great PQ even at very high ISO.", "Author": "Sam", "ReviewID": "R10X3WEO0PENBQ", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "[June, 2012 update] Probably everyone else who knows digital photography also knows about Dfine 2.0; I didn't until just recently. With the D3s, I can easily shoot at ISO 6400 and up then use Dfine to remove the grain.  I was able to get very low grain photographs at ISO 102,800 with Dfine]I've waited many years for a camera with the features offered in the Nikon D3s.My problem with cameras has been the limitation of only shutter speed and aperture to choose from.  It was like living in a 2 dimensional world.  Many of my photographs were blurred because I didn't have enough available light. Cranking up the ISO on digital cameras produced horrific electronic noise.  In the film world, I could push Tri-X to 800 ASA or beyond when I needed speed and, quite frankly I happen to like the grainy quality of real film -- not Photoshop faux grain.I can now shoot pictures with the D3s that were previously impossible to obtain. I can safely crank the ISO up to 6400 and beyond.  With the auto-ISO, I now live in a 3 dimensional world -- I have 3 variables to achieve blur-free photographs.[Side note: My only complaint with the auto-ISO feature is that it doesn't take the lens focal length into consideration.  It would be a significant improvement if the camera could set the minimum shutter speed based upon the focal length.  On the 70-200mm zoom lens I can shoot at slower speeds at 70mm then at 200mm.  Also, I have to manually change the minimum shutter speed each time I change lenses. However, this criticism is not isolated to the D3s but all the Nikon models with this feature.]While my ideal camera would have had many more pixels like the D3x so that I could crop without losing significant quality, as well as high ISO quality, these features are not yet available. I chose the D3s because of the higher ISO.  I don't shoot in studios.Why the D3s, as opposed to the D700? (I have that camera too)The 90% viewfinder on the D700 drives me nuts. I have to guess how much of the image is actually going to be captured.  If the cropped viewfinder doesn't bother you, then the D700 may be a considerably less expensive alternative.  In addition, without the battery pack attached, the D700 weighs less.  The D700 produces great images at high ISO, the D3s is a stop or two better.  And the D700 without the battery pack is less conspicuous as well.I've added a number of images to the picture gallery (sadly, without using Dfine or the photos would have been much impressive).  I've included test photos at high to very high ISO speeds -- photographs that previously would have been impossible to shoot.Rather than add another list of all the reasons why I think the D3s is a fantastic camera that have been endlessly described in so many other reviews, I would like to comment on just some of the moronic negative criticisms that I've read in supposedly professional reviews.1) Common complaint:  The virtual horizon is a gimmick since good tripods have built in levels.Yes, I have one of those tripods and each time I reposition the legs on uneven surfaces or move the ball head, I have to eyeball the level which is a hassle.  I use the virtual horizon within the viewfinder, not the live view mode, and I find the feature very helpful.  Don't like the virtual horizon, don't use it.2) Common complaint:  The super high ISO is a gimmick.Let's think about that for a moment.  You see something in low light that you might never see again (e.g. a rare or thought to be extinct animal or a UFO), would you rather have a grainy picture or nothing at all?  Don't like the high ISO, don't use it.3) Common complaint: The movie mode is a gimmick or the quality isn't on par with a dedicated camcorder.I read a review that tore the movie quality feature to shreds and suggested buying a dedicated camcorder instead.  I did a a quick check of professional camcorders and the prices seem to range from about $1,500 to over $30,000.  So now I have to buy and shlepp two cameras around?  I suspect most people don't buy the D3s for the movie feature.  They buy it for the FX, high ISO and build quality.  I've tried the movie feature, and while I'm disappointed that it doesn't auto-focus or use the VR in my lens, I'm not going to throw the camera away.This movie quality complaint is like stating that since the trunk of your car can't carry everything you want to transport, you should exchange your car for a moving van.  Nothing does everything perfectly. You \"professional reviewers\" are idiots. The movie feature is simplistic but it's there if I want it.Don't want or like the movie feature, ignore it.4) Common complaint:  The camera is heavy and/or conspicuous.The reviewers expect high quality images, long battery life and a durable body and they think that they're going to get those features into the size of a point-and-shoot?  Camera too heavy for you?  Buy a lesser camera.  Camera too conspicuous?  First get rid of that ridiculously uncomfortable and blazing yellow neck strap and get a good plain black strap.  Second, use electrical tape and cover the 'Nikon' on the viewfinder.  I'm not a free walking billboard for Nikon.  Camera too heavy?  Wait a few years until battery technology improves then buy that camera.5) Common complaint:  The camera is expensive.So is a Lexus [or insert your favorite high-end vehicle here].  If the camera/car/other-entity was over-priced then no one would buy them and they'd stop making them.  Camera too expensive for you?  Buy a lesser camera.6) Common complaint: Canon has some better features.Yup, that's true.  If you make your living with photography, then buy both cameras and use the tool that's most appropriate for the job.I'll stop my rant here.  I think I made my point.  Many reviewers are total idiots and write to fill space.It amazes me how many people don't understand the concept of the Quiet shutter mode.  People think that by itself the shutter becomes magically quieter.  No it doesn't.  What the Quiet mode does is allow you to take a picture and continue to hold DOWN the shutter button and take a picture with extremely little noise.  When it's more convenient, you let go of the shutter button.  Then the mirror bounces back making a loud sound.  This allows you take surreptitiously take a photograph since most people aren't going to recognize the first sound of the mirror going up but the click-CLUNK! sound is very noticeable.So far, my only real negative criticism of the camera is the memory card doors.  For a camera that is supposed to be so rugged (some described it as military-grade quality), those two (2) doors seem awfully flimsy to me.  People have criticized the D700 for the door design but the D3s has two doors, and they're just a fragile as all of the other Nikon doors.  I Googled the phrase \"Nikon broken doors\" and found a ton of hits.  I don't open the door when there's a possibility that someone might bump into me and I close the door as quickly as possible.Joy:The ultra-high ISO with low noise (depending upon how high you set the ISO) can be very handy for utility photographs.  Yesterday I had to crawl under the deck to document some defects in the construction.  A flash was out of the question (not enough room) and I wasn't about to drag artificial lighting down there.  I needed some quick & dirty shots so I could send them to the builder.  I jacked up the ISO to 12K and over and uploaded directly to an email.  Do you need a $5K camera for this?  No, but hey, I already own the camera and I was able to take these quick shots that were utterly impossible before this camera.Sorrow:The viewfinder grid display option has been removed.  It's available on my D300 and on the D3x but not on the D3s.  The virtual horizon is good for outdoors but there are times when I want to align an item (e.g. a picture on a wall that's on a angle) and not have to use a photo editing program to make the corrections.  Why, oh why, has this option been removed?  At least I can use the D300 for those types of situations when I want the grid and don't need the D3s features.It's annoyingly conspicuous. (Yes, I know I'm contradicting myself here from a remark I made about the size, but the number of people staring at the camera getting annoying). I try to take a picture and people will stop and ask me if I'm a professional photographer.  If I had a little camera no one would notice or bother me.  If you're the type of person where equipment defines you, then you'll be happy with this type of attention.  Me? I want to blend into the background.  I've put electrical tape over the 'Nikon' on the viewfinder and on the 'D3s' but there's no going around the fact that it's huge. I think I got less attention when I used a 4x5 camera.In summary:This is a fantastic, highly responsive camera which yields tremendous PQ images even at incredibly high ISO speeds.  Will the D4, D5, D6 be better?  Of course.  But there's a point of diminishing returns.  My vehicle gets over 42MPG on the open road.  I'm not going to buy a new car because it gets incrementally better gas mileage.", "Date": "July 5, 2010"}, {"Title": "The Ultimate Sports Camera", "Author": "Harry Spooner \"Harry Spooner\"", "ReviewID": "R22ZOA8KLTUP73", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I have shot with the Nikon D3 since it was released in November of 2007 and have over 150,000 shots on it.

Football Field on a Friday night or H.S. basketball in a poorly lit gym.  The D3 excelled.  After reading the early findings of the ISO ability of the D3S I decided to sell my trusty backup (Nikon D700) and add the D3S.  I am in total awe.  I would never venture into the \"HI\" ranges of ISO on the D3, but recently shot an entire wrestling event in ISO 25,600 (HI 1.0) with stunning results (I cleaned up with N. Ninja with relatively no loss of detail).  Now I am totally comfortable shooting cleanly at 12,800 which allows me to increase my shutter speeds.  For years Canon had a lock on the low light high ISO photography, but with the D3 that has changed, and now Nikon has raised the bar even more with the D3S.

Prior to that I had a D2Xs for 3 years and a D1X for 2 years. The improvements between the D2Xs and the D3s are staggering. Most obvious is the jump from the DX to FX sensor, which I absolutely love because I've finally got a big, bright viewfinder and my old Nikon glass works just as it did with my old Nikon film cameras. Nikon also got their white balance settings right... gone are the green cast of the D1X and the yellow cast of the D2Xs when set for sunlight or shade. The D3s's colors are correct right out of the box 95% of the time. And the image quality is simply stunning, although you really should invest in high-caliber glass to get the most out of this camera. I traded my AF-S DX 18-200 f/3.5-5.6 VR zoom lens for two much bigger and heavier lenses: the AF-S 24-70 f2.8G ED and the AF-S NIKKOR 70-200 f/2.8G ED VRII, and there's simply no comparison in terms of color balance, sharpness and low-light performance.Speaking of low-light performance, it's well known that this camera's sensor has remarkably low noise at extremely high ISO settings. I can take almost any shot, at any light level, without a flash. The results in near-darkness are astonishing; it's like having a night-vision camera. Nevertheless, I've also shot with flash and the results are much better out of the box than they were with my previous two Nikon digital SLR's.I don't use the video features so I can't comment on them.The learning curve when switching to this camera from the D2Xs was nil; I was immediately productive because the controls and their locations changed only slightly, and the changes that were made were for the better.When I bought my previous two Nikon digitals I was always hoping for a full-frame sensor and knew that if one ever came along I'd be ditching my camera.

Many have complained that it's easy to activated/hit the af-on or shutter buttons for the vertical grip, this is true, but it's easy enough to flip a switch and turn them off when not using the vertical grip, problem solved!The photos produced with this camera are beyond phenomenal with rich colors, great contrast, and wonderful detail.  Everything I read was correct,  12 megapixels done right is way more than enough.  The autofocus system is the fastest I've ever experienced on a camera, and possibly one of the most accurate.  I've enjoyed the in camera editing, and wonderfully laid out histograms. The high ISO capabilities are partially what sold me on the D3s, along with the 100% viewfinder.  I could go on and on about the pluses of this camera.  The only downsides to this camera are its weight, it's not light, but its ergonomics make up for that, and the lack of included software.  It may be just me, but a camera this expensive should have included Capture NX2.

Losing a shot (or the high risk of losing a shot) due to time spent trying to obtain the point, or loss in focus due to recompose after focus.Another issue I had was the overall ergonomics with Canon. I have fairly large hands, so a grip on the 5D was absolutely essential to me - but the ergonomics of Canon were outdated. The unit coupled with the grip was a bit cumbersome, but I tried to look past it with my years of Canon loyalty. The feel of the canons, even the 1Ds series could not compare to the D3s my associate brought to the last wedding I shot in September. Once I felt that body, saw and experienced the build quality of it, and the output - I knew something changed in me. I knew at some point I would end up switching - when exactly was the question.So I looked at resale values of the canon gear, what I had to spend and what I could make back - and pulled the plug on the Nikon D3s. The resolution downgrade so far has yet to bite me. Even if I run into a situation where a customer needs billboard sized print, Genuine Fractals will work just fine. I do product photography as well, an it's served me very well so far. Sure - a large 21mp image would be nice, but it's not necessary for most of my applications.I was nervous switching being a life long Canon user, but with all of the things I like to shoot, I came up with a quick list of pro's and cons of the D3s that helped me make my decision.Pros of the Nikon vs Canon:* Full frame 9fps (11fps in crop mode)* Higher sync speed for strobes compared to the 1/160 - 1/200 on 5D2.* AWESOME AF system. Even in low light so far, it blows away the canon. Not having to recompose a shot is a true treat.* High ISO speed has destroyed everything else I have used.* The build quality is amazing.* Still has video mode, albeit 720p vs canons 1080p* Comes with vertical grip with amazing ergonomics (1Ds comparable but the NIkon is lightyears better)* Better control placement. Aperture and Shutter controls are thumb and index finger wheels where your hand naturally rests. No reaching for the wheel like on the canon. They also Lock when needed.* Outstanding burst write speed. Redundancy to boot.But all in all - I thought it was worth taking the risk to switch and so far I love everything about the Nikon D3s and have no desire to move back to Canon. I have the Nikkor 24-70 2.8G lens which is sharp as a razor, the Nikkor 105 2.8D Macro lens which is also razor sharp, and the 50 1.4G Nikkor.One downside, there is no on board infrared trigger mechanism if you wanted to remote shoot portraits. I had to buy a separate unit for that. Not a big deal. This is after all not a consumer end camera.The Nikon D3s amazing. Seriously no regrets at all.

The guy shooting the D3s had the live view on, and after darkness had totally ended my own shooting for the day, I took a look at his monitor and was totally knocked out by the illumination.I went right home and ordered the body from Amazon. I had only had it a month or so last May, when I took it to the Black Hills on a trip with my girlfriend to photograph wildlife.  At one point, we parked the SUV at an overlook to photograph the spectacular scene laid out before us, and somehow...I still don't know exactly what happend...the D3s got away from me.

I don't normally need high ISO, and I have a collection of fast lenses including the Nikkor 85mm f1.4G and 50mm f1.4G and D for portrait.  Hence, D300S was enough for my requirements for a couple of years.Things have changed, however, when I have a newborn baby boy 11 months ago.  I can take beautiful pictures of his during the daytime when there is plenty of natural light, but not so during the evening or night time when the light is much dimmer.  I don't use flash when shooting my baby's picture for obvious reasons.  Without the flash, the fastest lens I have is still not fast enough, unless I bump up the ISO.The D300S allows me to take clean pictures up to ISO 800.  Anything beyond that, however, give me noise which has affected the sharpness of the images.  Since I already have fast lenses, I want to have a FX camera body capable of doing higher ISO and D700 seems to be the next logical choice.  However, I wasn't sure I want to pay for something that may be replaced by a newer product the next day.  While, I have been very patient in waiting for a D700 replacement, which it didn't come out (as many have speculated on 24 Aug 2011) my baby son is growing up fast everyday and having fun moments that I just don't want to miss anymore.So, I set aside the thought of the possible D700 replacement, and decided to get a D700 instead (since it has fantastic review too), except it was out of stock everywhere.  D3S was available, so, I bit the bullet and bought one.Even though jumping from D300S to D3S seems like a big step, D3S is not that much disimilar to a D300S from a handling perspective.  Most of the functions in the D300S are also found in the D3S.  The new functions in the D3S are incremental, which are not too difficult to figure out.  With a full size body, it does have more fuctions that you can set using the designated button on the body, as opposed to going through the camera menu.With battery, and a Nikkor 24-70mm f2.8 attached, the D3S weighs about 2.7kg (5.94 Ibs).With the D3S, I can shoot images at ISO 3200 (the lowest ISO for that lighting condition), yet with noise less than the D300S at ISO 800. With a bit of post-pocessing, the images are actually very clean (close to images take at ISO 400 using the D300S).This camera has everything that I want and need and I will have no regret even if it were to be replaced by a newer camera tomorrow.

Yes, 12MP may seem low by today's standards of Megapixels but it is more than enough for 80% of all shooters.  This camera just rocks!  Unfortunately, many people are caught up with marketing ploys with larger, bigger, faster numbers.The Nikon D3S delivers quality photographs, with exception detail in many lighting situations including some of the most difficult lighting situations.  In fact, since I have owned this camera, 1 year and counting, I have not used my SB800 to capture 1 imaged including my low light photography.  This camera just delivers that well.It is a robust of a camera which means it is a bit heavy because it is built like a tank and could be used as a weapon.  It is made of steal, it is weather sealed and it is thoroughly safeguarded in its material use and craftsmanship.  Even more so, the buttons are just in the right place and 90% of the adjustments you need to make during shooting can be done right on the body with a button instead of having to go into the menu system like prosumer or consumer bodies.Color replication is handled quite well and I am very impressed with the red channel which is usually very difficult for any camera.  The auto-focusing just works and works well and it locks focus very quickly even with some of the much older lenses.  When you use this camera you just don't want to use any other camera afterwards.The only downside is, as a professional body, it is most definetly heavier and larger than the rest of the Nikon lineup but that is to be expected for this level of camera.I highly recommend this camera to anyone looking for a professional camera that just does what you expect it to do with little effort and fiddling with multiple settings.

Starting out with the D5000, D3100, D90, D7000, D700, D800 (currently own).I ended up selling my D7000 as once you hit ISO 3200 a ton of noise rears it's ugly head. Let alone the focusing accuracy on the D7000 is no where near as accurate as the Multi-Cam FX3500 (51 point) system. If you are a hobbyist the D7000 is a great camera for the money. If you are a pro or semi-pro this D3s camera will not disappoint. When shooting events even using flash if it's really dark and you need to push your ISO around 3200+ this is the camera for you! The focus accuracy is amazing let alone the sheer speed of focus.Most will ask why didn't I just get a D4. There are a few reasons, first spending the additional $1500 for the camera itself and investing in new memory cards XQD - they are not cheap and Sony is infamous for making new platforms which some succeed and some fail. Now that Lexar just announced they will make XQD there is some hope! After reading countless articles and reviewing DXOMark review on the D4 and Fstoppers review on the D3s vs D4 I found that \"my needs\" would be met with the Nikon D3s. I have not been disappointed yet - not having to worry about ISO up to 12,800 (not that I would want to shoot that high) relieves a lot of pressure. The D3s still is slightly better at the higher ISO then even the new D4. What Nikon and Canon (5D Mk III and even the 1DX) are doing as we are pushing the ISO noise envelope is they are blurring the images to remove some noise. Read the Fstoppers review on the D3s vs D4 they show samples. While the Dynamic range is better on the D4 and there are some evolutionary improvements not revolutionary - the D3s still will be a great camera for many years to come. Again others may have different needs - I purchased my D3s USED with only 917 Clicks so for the money I got a bargain!My only complaint is when shooting vertical the D-pad is a little stretch but that is my only complaint.UPDATE: 10-18-12. I have to say I like the D3s BETTER than my D800. I can get over 600 images RAW 14-bit Lossless compressed shots on a 16GB Sandisk Ultra CF card. Editing the files are quick and I have taken shots up to ISO 16,000-25,600 and they are freaking amazing awesome little to no noise. The D3s can handle just about ANYTHING - as good as the D800 is the camera is unforgiving while I use the D800 for portraits/landscape shots if you shoot below 1/80 of a second on the D800 you have a good chance of getting a blurry shot.", "Date": "July 17, 2012"}, {"Title": "D3S even better", "Author": "G.

(I turn high ISO NR Off all the time and work on it in post)2) Great build quality and feels great in hand despite the weight. (so does the D7000)3) Excellent (not perfect) ergonomics and layout of buttons. I can spend all day talking about how good this is!4) Bench mark in battery life.5) This sounds silly but i love the feel of the D3s neck strap. It feels much softer and comfortable than the one for the D7000. I can bare the heavier camera for longer times on my neck/shoulder.6) I shoot BASIC JPGs 90% of the time and they're coming out great with file sizes between (1.5-2.5)MB!! which renders a faster processing time for uploading photos to my computer, zooming in, processing in Photoshop, ...etc. Which means I can save money on my laptop and don't need to get a fast processor.The Bad:1) No 1080p video. (D7000 has it)2) Multi-selector is a little out of reach (for my hand) when shooting portrait.3) No ability to assign active D-lighting to any function button. (D7000 is able to do so)4) In order to do any retouching i need to go the the retouch menu, choose the retouch method first, and then search for the particular photo i need to retouch!! In my D7000 i used to hit the OK button on any photo i'm viewing while in play mode and directly choose the retouch method which makes much more sense and is much faster.5) Auto-focus is not faster than my D7000 using the same lenses! booo :(6) Quite mode is useless. (better on my D7000)7) NO custom settings mode. (D7000 had three!!)8) No in-camera distortion control.

I mainly shoot indoor sports (martial arts) and even with the D300s I was never able to freeze the action because to be able to do that I had to push the ISO so high that the noise level of the picture was unacceptable and to avoid that I had to use a flash which limitated my speed to 250 and also disturbed some of the athletes. I first used my new D3s with the 70-200mm f2.8 VRII Nikon lens. The results were beyond my expectations. I was able to shoot at ISO 2500 and at a speed of 400 getting crystal clear and sharp images. Incredibly there is no noise at all at this ISO setting, even less than my D300s at ISO 800.

I got the D3s with the 24-70mm, the 70-200mm VRII and the teleconverter 1.7X. With these I was able to get all the images I wanted and more. Until my D300s I considered myself an advance amateur but now with this gear I can say that I got to the Pro level... My results and the acceptance and demand of my pictures on this last event was more than twice I normally did.In conclusion, this camera yes is expensive but on the other hand you get what you pay for: Pro level and top quality results.

I am an artistic street photographer, and it does everything I ask of it.  I stopped using my Canon 1Dsiii the day I bought it.However, before you buy this, or any other Nikon, you must realize that their repair service is horrible if you are not a registered professional, no matter how much professional equipment you might own.Instead of repairing your equipment within a week or so, they regularly hold equipment for 6-10 weeks for \"parts.\"  I have enquired on forums, and this was true even before the tsunami.My camera body required repair, and it was held hostage for 7 weeks.  It came back with the vertical shutter release not working.  They sent me a mailer for a free repair, but it made more sense to do without the vertical shutter than to lose the use of my camera for such a long time.My camera stopped working again a week ago.  It would still be covered by the warranty from the first repair.  But I do not want to give up my camera as a hostage to Nikon service ever again.  I brought it to a PhotoTech in NYC and put it on my credit card.  There is another place in the midwest called Authorized Photo Service that gets recommended.  I have not tried it.  Both will repair you camera in a week.The camera is a 5 star camera, a modern wonder, in fact.  Please don't accuse me of being a Canon troll.But an advanced DSLR is not just a camera body, but part of a complete system of that combines quality, reliability and suitability to many purposes.  One part of Nikon's system --repairs for customers who are not members of NPS --is broken.I'd buy this camera again, and I'm looking forward to the D4.  But if you're going to buy it, please be aware that you never want Nikon to repair it, if the use of the camera has any value to you.", "Date": "September 29, 2011"}, {"Title": "Seriously an amazing piece of technology", "Author": "JohnInCO", "ReviewID": "R5EJ9D2MVLRAA", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This camera is flat-out amazing.  It truly shoots in the dark.  I shoot a lot of events and I hate working with a flash on my camera.  And I don't like the look of a flash when mounted on the body either.  I don't even start to get nervous unless I see my ISO going over 10K.  That's right - ISO 10,000.  And then Lightroom 3 and Noiseware can clean up any grain I get anyway.  It really is perhaps one of the best cameras on the market right now.  I'm dying to see what the D4 will bring but I'll be holding out until the D5.  For the next few years, this camera body will continue to let me take amazing photographs.  I know it's not the camera, it's the photographer, but a camera like this can make anyone look great if you take the time to learn how to work with it.My only complaint is that it shoots really cool.  I'm moving toward shooting in Kelvin and keeping it around 6000 because it is just so cool when I put it on Auto WB.  But those are easy fixes in LR anyway.This camera isn't for everyone (I'm not entirely sure it's even for ME but I have it and you'll have to pry it from my dead fingers before I give it up).  But if you appreciate incredible technology, treat yourself to something amazing.  Putting it in High FPS at 11 fps with the 70-200mm and taking it to the park and shooting continuously will make all the days step back and take notice.

I do portraits and photojournalism. There are many good things about this camera which have been said. What I don't like about it is that some low contrast details are lost on RAW files. The low noise ability of this camera comes with suppression of high frequency details compared to high resolution cameras in the same category. I am talking about unprocessed RAW images. Another issue is that colors in the red and orange are not exact and have this Matisse/neon coloration. Some people will like this but i like a neutral camera not one that gives artificially colors. My other camera is a Canon MkIII the one that supposedly has AF issue. Well i have zero issues with it and I am much happier with its rendition of colors and details than top of the line Nikon who is supposed to trample it but does not even come close.
