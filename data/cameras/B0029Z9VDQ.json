Canniff \"paul206\"", "ReviewID": "R1L4WLGJ4SI8P9", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I bought the Pentax W60 six months ago on the way to an indoor waterpark.  I wanted something that would be functionally equivalent to my existing Canon SD 870 IS: small and light, decent still shots, decent videos.Since then the Pentax has become my default camera.Pros:decent image qualitysome neat \"smart\" modeswaterproof and dust resistant means no worries about child-play environments!Cons:auto-focus seems to get it wrong more often than my Canonno one-button swap between still and movie modezoom quality seems lowerzooming during video has big big focus issuesshort battery life per chargingIf I only had one camera for all occaisions, those cons might be overwhelming, but I also have a Nikon D90 which I use for formal occaisions or highly dramatic scenery.  So, for my \"everyday\" use, I'm swayed by the robust nature of the waterproof housing.Let me specifically address the video cons.  First, my Canon (and all its ancestors) has a simple physical switch to move from still mode to movie mode.  The Pentax has a menu system which requires me to push one button, navigate over a few places, and push again.  Under pressure of capturing a kid in action, that's a recipe for failure.  Second, the zoom may be less nice because of the inability to have a lens poking out the front, but I am puzzled by what seems to be the complete failure of the auto-focus when I zoom during a video.Depending on your needs, you may weigh these issues differently.  For me, this camera is great solution.", "Date": "August 17, 2009"}, {"Title": "Disappointing. Poor followon to the W10", "Author": "karen0017 \"karen0017\"", "ReviewID": "R2KX3UOYR65FM4", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "I bought the W60 early this summer when my W10 was damaged in an accident. I am extremely disappointed in the W60.The user interface is basically fine, but I find it hard to press the separate buttons (I always feel fat-fingered on it). The W10 in contrast was much easier to manipulate.The waterproof housing is noticeably improved over the W10.The battery has almost no lifespan. I get about 60 pictures (no flash) before I have to recharge it. Even more annoying, the battery doesn't sit terribly well in the recharger, so you have to be careful to ensure that it's actually recharging. I find it *exceedingly* annoying that you can't recharge this camera from the USB port -- you plug in the camera to download the pictures, and even if the camera is attached to a wall outlet, the battery fails. I am also disappointed that they changed the battery shape from the W10 -- I have perfectly good batteries from that camera, and had to buy new ones for this; not very environmentally friendly!The flash is weaker that it was in the W10; and it's now almost useless. I get about 1.5 meters (4 feet) of range before the light fails -- that's extremely close up.The focus is quite poor. Even when in \"portrait\" mode (when it tries to look for faces), the camera does not always focus on the face it found. About 1/3 of my photos are out-of-focus. (On the W10, I'd only have problems when the subject was moving.) My suspicion is not that the focus mechanism itself is poor, but the algorithm that decides on where to focus picks the wrong item.About 4 weeks after I purchased the camera, the power switch failed. (It took quite some googling to figure out what the problem was, as the manual only says to recharge the battery.) Since I was on vacation at the time, I was VERY happy that I had a second camera with me. I sent it back to the manufacturer for repair, and it was returned about 10 days later. They had corrected the power switch, focus, and zoom block. It still can't focus well.The quality of underwater photos is slightly improved over the W10, but given that you're moving in the water and the fish are moving, the focus problem is really serious.Overall, I'm very disappointed. Even more so because I loved the W10, and was really looking forward to the next generation.", "Date": "September 9, 2009"}, {"Title": "Not as good as the Optio W10", "Author": "B. Herndon \"Bridgieee\"", "ReviewID": "R2D1B3AUL8F7S3", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "My Optio W10 died on me, and while it had it's faults it was a good reliable camera.  The W60 has some of the same complaints (slow to take pics, not good in low light, etc) but the images are even worse than the W10.  I wouldn't recommend this camera.  I haven't used the waterproof feature yet...plan on doing that in a couple weeks at the beach.", "Date": "September 26, 2009"}, {"Title": "Water lover", "Author": "Robert Edwards \"water lover\"", "ReviewID": "R2GRMHRZMM8ICI", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Worked very well on a holiday to the sand and surf.  Rinsing in fresh water after a day of use helps.  Was late rinsing once and battery door became sticky.  Took a good cleaning with a toothbrush to remedy.

There are a couple of things to watch out for, however. One is that the camera On/ Off button needs to be \"Off\" when you've finished. Even with the screen blank, you're still draining the battery. That brings up the second point, namely the fairly short battery life. After a couple of \"OH SHUCKS!\" experiences with a dead camera on the river, I simply bought two inexpensive 3rd party parties and put them in a plastic baggie in my fishing vest. The other suggestion is to buy a silicon cover to protect against drops. Mine cost about $15 and was worth it.", "Date": "August 5, 2012"}, {"Title": "Great Water Camera", "Author": "sprucehen", "ReviewID": "R2INAWCKWH00S6", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "This camera is a real workhorse.  Tough.  Absolutely waterproof.  Takes good underwater pics and in downpour.  Good pics in bright sunlight.  Have taken everywhere with me...swimming, kayaking, hiking, biking, etc.  Very reliable and easy to use.  I attach a floating wrist band that I purchased on amazon and throw it in the boat/kayak/canoe with no problem and no fears of losing it.  The size and shape work well...very easy to slip in a pocket or bag. I always carry an extra battery, though.  Definitely recommend (especially at a sale price).  Makes it easy to capture moments in wet weather/conditions that I wouldn't have otherwise been able to with my regular camera.  Priceless.A few cons:  Awful indoor and low-light pics.  Flash stinks...lots of red eye.  Quality good in above-stated conditions, but not on the level of my non-waterproof Canon Digital Elf.So -- know the limitations and use the Pentax for those great rugged and wet times when you can't use your fragile/easily damaged regular camera.  You'll love it.", "Date": "April 16, 2011"}, {"Title": "Great for outdoors...", "Author": "C. Hines \"Labrynth\"", "ReviewID": "RUU8PDFQIPWPL", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "Seeing as how this is a waterproof camera I'd say they probably really meant for it to be used more in the outdoor environment.  This pics it takes then are typically excellent quality.  Indoors or lower light however, suck.  They are grainy, fuzzy and, well, crap.  *sigh*The camera is small and very portable.  I used it in the pool and it had no problems at all.  But since it takes crappy indoor pics I'm looking for another camera for more full time use.  I imagine I'll probably love this one on vacation at the beach.Overall it's not a BAD camera, and likely does exactly what it was meant to do.
