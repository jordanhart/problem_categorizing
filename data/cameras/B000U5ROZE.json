My major requirements were high quality photos and a zoom lens. I finally decided on this particular camera because it looked like I was getting a lot for my money, and I believe I have. I took it on a trip within a week of receiving it and took excellent scenic photos, both close-up and with the powerful zoom, with almost no learning curve. I was pleasantly surprised that even with all of its power, the camera is not heavy and bulky, and its design makes it easy to hold. I also love the size of the screen and that I have the option of using the viewfinder or the large screen. I highly recommend this camera.", "Date": "November 7, 2007"}, {"Title": "Fujifilm wins!", "Author": "Richard L. Steiner", "ReviewID": "R27AUSRWAEMWK6", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I was hesitant to buy the Fujifilm S8000fd because there were a few reviewers who found problems with the pictures it produced.  I considered other cameras in the same genera and discovered there were a few reviewers who were not all that happy with those either.  It was clear to me that pictures shot with the Fujifilm S8000fd were at least equal to those made by its competitors and it had a lot more features and capacity.I think the people who fault the quality of photos taken with the Fujifilm S8000fd are either unable to read the instruction manual or are so \"picky\" about their pictures as to be neurotic.  I have had my Fuji S8000fd for about a month and find the pictures I am taking are just great.  I am not a professional photographer, but I have been an advanced-skills hobbyist for decades.This is my forth Fuji digital camera and it is the best of the bunch.  I researched my head off prior to buying the S8000fd and concluded that it was the best in its class and price range.  There are really only three cameras currently occupying this \"hybrid-SLR\" group--the Fujifilm S8000 of course, the Olympus SP-560 UZ and the Panasonic FZ18.  For my money--the Fujifilm S8000fd wins.By the way, the price on this camera on Amazon.com is almost fifty dollars cheaper than it was when I bought mine only a few weeks ago.", "Date": "December 18, 2007"}, {"Title": "You will LOVE this camera, if you know how to use P mode...", "Author": "Gopinath Jambulingam", "ReviewID": "R8H7RSPGTS6RT", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "This is my first Fuji Camrea. I owned a Canon G2 for 5 years.My Initial test on the camera was disppointing as I was shooting most pics in Low light condition in Auto Mode, P mode with very low ISO setting 100. I decided to return this camera.Before returning I wanted to give it one more try with all combination of ISO and SP modes. I took lot of pics with differnt ISO setting in P mode and all Kinds of SP modes. In P mode I have got very good pics both in Low and Day light conditions.Here is my recommended settings on P mode. In Bright Day lights Set ISO to 64. In low light conditions set ISO to 400 or 800 depending on the brightness of light. Set the Sharpness to HARD for Lowlight if you are lover of sharp pics. Also take pics by boosting the Exposure little bit if needed. Lowlight pics taken with these settings produced very less noise, vewing 100% on computer screen was not that bad at all. The Print qualtity will be still good if we stick to 6x4/5x7/8x11 size.Get closer (4-6 Feet) to the object in Low light conditions even if you decide to use flash.The AUTO and SP modes are not useful. The Pics taken with these modes shows lot of noise when viewing the Pic 100% on the computer.Stick to P mode always in Day or Lowlight.The Macro mode is very good, Excellent job done by the camera. I have shoot pics on morning dew set on the window in macro mode, I was stunned by the quality of the pics.The Image Stabilizer worked very good.The Face Detection works very well.The N and N plus Flash is a very good feature on this camera.WORTH THE MONEY. I cannot expect anything more on a NON SLR Camera.This camera qualifies for 5 Star rating. I have given 4 Stars because the qualtiy of buttons feels very cheap plastic and the Battery door is very Flimsy. People with bigger fingers may find it diffcult to feel the buttons. The buttons on Panasonic FZ8 is very good.HIGHLY RECOMMENDED......If Fuji used their Super CCD in this camera, it would be the best in the market.", "Date": "November 15, 2007"}, {"Title": "Review of S8000FD Camera", "Author": "J.

Bought this camera to replace a 4 year old HP with 8X zoom and 4MP.  I like to take wildlife and bird photos.  The new Fuji does an excellent job on scenery, but can not take as sharp of pictures as my old HP of birds.  I actually used them side by side and there is a difference in sharpness.  Fuji suggests that I can't use the zoom without a tripod, since I am moving more than the \"advanced\" image stabilization can handle.  Yet my old HP will work decent within the 40 digital zoom range beyond the optical zoom when hand held.  I actually had the oportunity of a lifetime last week to take several pictures of a Bald Eagle eating a road kill deer.  The bird let me get to within 18 feet and I took many photos with this new Fuji.  The photos came out OK, but not as clear as a photo of an Eagle from 18 feet should be.  It was suggested that background was bad and the camera had trouble with focus.  My comment was that it was a 2 foot tall large black and white object against a light brown background of the deer and soil.  Something easily focused on that my old HP would have made beautiful and produced several perfect shots.  The camera does do a super job on  macrofocus mode (super close up).", "Date": "November 6, 2007"}, {"Title": "Excellent Mega Zoom Camera", "Author": "Natalie", "ReviewID": "R3TJIIPOPYA7XD", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I have had this camera for about a week, the 4th fuji I've owned and am very pleased with all it can do.

The camera body is very confortable, strong and well designed, but im disappointed with the image quality. Even with firmare update (1.0.0 to 1.0.1) the images are below other cheap cameras:- The \"auto\" mode works very bad to me, it produces a bit dark images, and even in very good light conditions the \"auto\" sets the iso too high. In indoor photos, even with the flash activated, generally the pics are taken in iso 800, and its very common take pictures in iso 200 during day light. Maybe its not a problem if you will see the photos only in your monitor or at small sizes, but if you intend to print in large sizes, the qualit will not be good;- The sharppen is fairly, but could be better. An overview of the photos  at full size in monitor, shows images a little blurry;- The autofocus is good, but not perfect, its common to see pics out of the perfect focus;At bottom line, i recommend a \"test drive\", only this way you will see if this camera will be good to you. Its true that the S8000 has a lot of good features, not a bad cam, but as i said, i was expecting a better image quality, and im not affraid to say that my old Sony P200 produces best, more sharppen and accurated photos than S8000fd.

Some functions are slow in operation.Buy it if you want a camera that does is all, but look at the Canon S5 IS first....also uses regular batteries.But, if you have the cash, buy a real dSLR from Canon or Nikon and then maybe spring for a good subcompact for times when you dont need to drag a full size camera around.My suggestion is a Nikon d40x or D80 if you want to learn how to take real pics....and then a Canon Powershot subcompact.For $327, I cant complain about the Fujifilm S8000fd, but I expected just a little better picture quality.....the Fujifilm S700 would perhaps come very close to this camera in overall functionality and the S700 is under $200 now.", "Date": "October 19, 2007"}, {"Title": "Sweet Camera", "Author": "Donald E.

I had my choices narrowed down to three cameras one of which was the FujiFilm. I wanted a camera like my old one that was not too small, that would fit my hand and be easy to hold. I wanted a big optical zoom and that narrowed the cameras down to just a few. I liked the looks of the FujiFilm, however, some of the reviews said the SD card was hard to slide in as it went in at an angle. Also, several reviews talked about one of the doors being flimpsy. Anyway, I finally couldn't make up my mind, so I went to local camera shops and finally found the ones I liked in stock. The FujiFilm won out heads down. There is nothing short of amazing about this camera and it is well built. The only thing that I see the others must have been talking about is the rubber cover that fits over the power/usb openings. My other camera that was stolen had a rubber cover and I didn't fine that to be any problem and after several years of use never had a problem. The macro for close-ups is awesome and the 18x zoom is as well. Finally, thru reviews and actually seeing the different cameras at photo shops I decided on the FujiFilm FinePix s8000fd. It really fits my hand perfectly and feels like a camera and not a toy. Not easy to drop as a much smaller one would be. The hand holding and shutter button are in the perfect position.

First off let me say that it seems that a lot of the negative reviews concerning this camera are about things other than the camera itself. Filter through those and you will see this is a very good camera. And as for Fuji Customer service, I dropped my camera on the last day of a trip overseas and broke it. I sent it to the Fuji repair center and they promptly exchanged it for a new one. Yes, I had to pay $75, but it was my fault and Fuji was very fast - I had the new one a week later.As mentioned in the title, this camera is more than a point-and-shoot model. If all you're looking to do is set it on Auto and shoot away, you will get VERY GOOD pictures most of the time, but to really get GREAT photos, you need to delve into the program modes. More complex certainly and if you're not willing to learn then this camera will go under-utilized.The best feature of this camera is the focal length with the 18x optical zoom. This allows you to frame the photo properly before taking it and not have to crop much afterwards. The result: higher quality photos. YOU can capture scenes with 18x that you can't from most consumer digital cameras, and image stabilization makes it possible to get clear photos.This camera is positioned at the higher end of the consumer line -appealing to those who want the smaller size and price of a consumer digital camera, but want many of the features found in prosumer models. In that aspect, the s8000fd hits the sweet spot very well. There are a lot of features that will appeal to those looking to be more creative.I have taken some 500+ photos with this camera and have been very pleased with the results. I have used the photos for enlargements up to 11x14. There is some additional, noise when shooting in lower-light conditions, but the majority of the time this can be componsated for or eliminated by adjusting the camera's flexible exposure settings.At the risk of being redundant, let me say that this camera has more features than a good 95% of people want or will even take the time to use. But given a chance this is a good camera and since it's been replaced with the 8100fd, it is a great deal at the sub-300 price-point.This is my second FujiFilm SLR-like camera and I have been pleased with both.", "Date": "April 4, 2008"}, {"Title": "Poor, very poor....", "Author": "J.

And I did not want to spend $70 for a replacement Li-ion battery in case I needed one, so the Fuji looked like a good option.First impressions weren't bad : good menu system (though I never really understood why the F-button functions and the Menu were so confusing). The lens did extend longer than expected, but I could live with that.But when taking the first pictures, I was truly disappointed. The images looked grainy, unsharp, undetailed. Like a camera from several generations ago. I then started experimenting with all the settings, abandoned the AUTO, tried every imaginable manual/high-quality/Low ISO setting, but I felt the results remained poor. I then compared with my little Canon Ixus 55, compared identical pictures... and found the Canon - smaller, lower Pixels,..) came out WAY better, WAY sharper, WAY more natural.And that was just on low ISO. Going to ISO 200 and above? Forget it, quality was so terrible, you thought you'd be looking at one of those VGA cameras they give away as business gifts.I tried and tried again to make the pics look good - in bright light, customized settings, everything... but again, disapointment....Oh, I also noticed that at full lenght zoom, the camera refused to focus on objects 2-3 meter further. And there is an unacceptable amount of purple fringing.So, after 2 weeks, I sold it, and bought the Panasonic FZ 18.

The dSLR body is nice for people with big hands or who like the feel of a dSLR.Now, when it comes to inside...the pictures are blurry (even when on dual-stabilization). I couldn't take a clear picture of my niece (3 1/2 years old), my nephews (2 years old), or any of my dogs indoors. They were all blurry, even with flash. It takes fairly quick pictures indoors, but for some reason they are all blurry (and I've played around with the settings). And the white balance inside is not true-to-life, and changing the white balance settings doesn't seem to help. The strap won't stay attached to the camera very long, which is getting kinda annoying. And there is no way to just view your pictures without having the camera come on, the lens come out, and the lens cover have to come off, and that gets a little annoying.If you are going to predominantly take pictures indoors then consider another camera, or consider buying a more inexpensive Sony point-and-shoot camera for your indoor pictures.

It has the feel of an SLR and the configuration of the body makes it very easy to grip for 1 hand shooting.  The picture quality is very good although I've found that doing a quick auto fix on a photo editing program really optimizes the photos.  It does particularly well in interiors with natural light.  I bought the camera because of the adjustable lens length - it goes from a slight wide angle to a fairly long telephoto which has really helped reduce baggage while traveling. My previous camera required an attachment for macro photography but macro capability is built into this camera.  I was surprised by the video capabilities of the camera which I never saw mentioned in the Fuji's advertisement for this camera.  The picture is very clear and good in low light although the video function requires a fixed lens length which means that you cannot zoom in or out in video mode.  The camera construction seems to be of high quality with exception of the small plastic cover for the usb connection and power cord.  Still after 2 years of steady use, the plastic cover is still intact so I guess that it must be more durable than it appears.I wouldn't hesitate to recommend this camera to a discrimination friend particulary one who wants to travel light but still have a lot of flexibility in getting the perfect shot.", "Date": "December 26, 2009"}, {"Title": "Slow; Disappointing Image Quality", "Author": "endsleigh", "ReviewID": "RQG7BDPJR9QR6", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "I bought this camera essentially as a megapixel upgrade from my Finepix s5000, which served me very well but produced images only at 3.2MP. I am sorely disappointed with the s8000, so much so that I sometimes bring out the s5000 if I know I won't have time to set up the shot carefully. The main cons to this camera are:1) Very slow. Lack of speed is the major problem with this camera. It is slow to start up, slow to transfer images to memory, and very slow between depressing the fire button and the picture being taken. Many shots are lost due to this delay.2) Poor \"Auto\" mode image quality. Sets ISO too high & shutter speed too low, producing grainy and/or blurry photos even under normal lighting conditions. Since Auto mode is a failure, I have to manually adjust the settings for each shot.3) Poor image clarity. Images are frequently slightly, but still noticeably, blurry. I suspect this is a lens problem, since getting the optics right on an 18x zoom lense that can also do supermacro would be extremely difficult. I think they tried to jam too many optical features into one camera body.4) Autofocus is quite unreliable. You really have to watch what it grabs on to.5) Flash is even harsher than it was on my s5000.On the bright side, as with other Fuji cameras I've used/owned, the body is sturdy and quite comfortable in the hand, image transfer is pretty fast, and navigating the interface is quite intuitive.Even for the price, I would never recommend that anyone purchase this camera.

I enjoy taking photos of birds but this camera has a hard time focusing on an object that is far off.  If I want to take a picture of a bird that is at the end of the zoom range and there is a tree in the background that takes up more of the frame, the camera will focus on the tree and the subject in the center will be out of focus.The camera is near useless indoors as any picture taken of people will be blurry if the subject moves the least little bit and all photos have been extremely noisy when taken on the auto mode.I have taken some beautiful photos with this camera but not without lots of deleted photos in the process.  I am now looking at purchasing another \"super zoom\" camera to replace this one.", "Date": "June 23, 2009"}, {"Title": "Very good if you're willing to play with the settings", "Author": "BioTeach \"BioTeach\"", "ReviewID": "R3CLVMJSRUU7PT", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I've owned this camera for  about a month now, and am generally very happy with my purchase - especially given the price I paid for it, which was $290.  Of course, nothing in life is perfect - there are a few things I'm not too thrilled about.  I'm really only a learner with respect to photography, so professionals and experienced amateurs may not find my opinions too useful.Things I really like:The zoom - This is really amazing, and I don;t think you can get much better than this in a compact camera.  I've been able to get really good close up shots of distant subjects.  The problem of course is camera shake - if possible, use a tripod; if not, try to stabilise yourself in whatever way you can.  I prefer to use the electronic viewfinder when using high zoom - I find it helps to stabilise the camera.  Also, take many attempts at your zoom shots - without a tripod, many will be blurred, but you might get a few that are good.The continuous shooting mode - I love this....  In this mode, you can take a series of shots of moving action, in a matter of a couple of seconds, just by holding the button down - excellent for sports.  The problem with this is that when you review your pictures, you lose this setting, and have to go through the menu again to set it for continuous shooting.  Also, it takes a few seconds after you finish a series of shots to save the pics, so you can't take any more shots in that time.The natural light mode - I love the way this mode keeps the colour and produces high quality pics.  It's particularly designed, I think, for less than ideal lighting conditions, but I find it works well in bright light too.  In lower light, of course, there is the possibility of blur if your subject or the camera moves.  That said, I think I take most of my pics in this setting.Macro and Super-Macro modes - I get amazing close up shots with these modes!!!  Possibly the camera's best feature!The range of settings and modes - There are so many different things you can do with this camera that are so much more versatile than the basic compact camera (though I guess this is true of most cameras of this sort).  Changing the ISO, colour saturation, white balance, different flash settings, etc, etc.  I find myself shooting the same scene over and over in different settings to find which is the best.  As a result I take A LOT of pictures.... But it's all fun!  And I usually end up with some really good shots.Things I really DON'T like:The software - the Fuji software is slow, and takes up all my computer's processing power.  Perhaps with a better computer this wouldn;t be a problem, but my computer does everything else I need to do as fast as  I want it to...  But running this software means I can't do anything else at the same time, and it takes ages to do anything.  I've taken to using Picasa to edit my pics instead.  On the plus side, the software saves the info on the settings used in taking the picture, so you can review your pics and work out what you;ve done wrong and what works best.The menus - I find the menus to be rather complex and not particularly intuitive.  This means when I want to try certain things, I have to spend a fair amount of time searching for the function I want.  I guess as I get accustomed to the camera, though, this will be less of a problem.Limited exposure time - the maximum length of exposure seems to be 4 seconds.  I find this kind of limiting - with my old camera (Kodak DX7440 - a very decent camera in my opinion) - I could get exposure times up to about half a minute, and maybe more.  I'm rather disappointed at this, though of course, the camera still takes very good night time shots.Things I am having some difficulty/problems with:Low light conditions, moving subjects, especially in combination with the zoom.  I think this is probably the most difficult sort of shot I've tried to take.  I find that I get some combination of underexposed, blurred, grainy shots, no matter what settings I use.  If the subject is stationary it's not a problem - I use the night settings, and get very good results.  This is something I am working on...  Of course, if you WANT to get blurred shots, using the night setting can produce some interesting effects.I've recently found that the electronic viewfinder sometimes goes a bit funny...  I get white streaks across the image from one side, and sometimes the image is shifted a bit to the side too.  This seems to happen particularly when I've been using the camera continuously for a longish while - like an hour or so.  Switching off and then on again fixes it temporarily, but it tends to come back after a few minutes.  It doesn;t seem to happen with the LCD, and I don;t think it's been affecting the quality of the pictures, so I think it's a problem with the viewfinder itself.  I've been wondering if this might be caused by the camera getting a bit warm...  Around the battery compartment does tend to warm up a bit after extensive use.In general, also, I'd say I'm not thrilled by the quality of the image in the viewfinder, either.  It tends to have a bit of a lined effect anyway, and the colours are sometimes off (reds often appear sort of magenta), but these effects are, again, only in the viewfinder, and don;t appear in the pictures.  Despite this, I still prefer to use the viewfinder than the LCD for framing my shots.On the whole, though, I am extremely happy with this purchase.  I think I got excellent value for money, my photos have improved tremendously, and I am having a lot of fun and learning a lot about the art of photography.  The problems are really minor compared to the things I love about it.Some recommendations: buy a camera case, spare batteries and charger, and a fairly large memory card.  And a tripod!  And most of all, don't treat this like a \"point and shoot\".  Use the wide range of settings to get the best results.", "Date": "November 1, 2008"}, {"Title": "Amazing camera for the price!", "Author": "Christopher Huff", "ReviewID": "R1748TRPITU92H", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "We could not be more happy with our decision to purchase this camera.

But I returned it and bought a different make.", "Date": "February 8, 2008"}, {"Title": "Very poor camera", "Author": "Jason Dennis", "ReviewID": "R39F6EQFWMF8UD", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "The camera's pictures were fuzzy in every mode, but especially auto. I realize maybe tinkering with enough in custom settings I could have got a better picture, but auto should at least be able to take \"some\" still simple pictures okay. The cheapest camera out there can do that. We were upgrading from a Sony Mavica CD1000, and quality wise the sony still blew this away.After only a week of very light use the camera suddenly said \"Lens error\" when turning it on and the lens clearly was not going in and out correctly. We called Fuji who told us to send it in for a \"6 week turnaround\" on repair. The fact that we only had this camera for a week didnt seem to surprise them.

I bought this camera to replace my FinePix 3800 (which I COMPLETELY LOVED, but wore it out), and I have to say that I am very disapointed with the photo quality in this new one.  I'm just a stay at home mom of two boys thought I was buying a camera equal to my old one--to capture all my boys milestones and family moments. My previous camera only had 3.2 megapixel and 6x optical capability and the photo quality was so much better... how does that make sense?On the pro side for this camera, the macro (close up) function is amazing--those pictures do come out extremely high quality and the video shoots non-stop (until your mem card fills up) instead of in 60 seconds intervals.  There is also black and white, and sepia--all kinds of neato features, but when it comes down to it, this is not a point and shoot camera.I wish they'd just add all these new neat features to the 3800--I wasn't looking to shoot artsy fartsy close-ups of flowers, or award winning videos, just really great, clear and impressive pictures of my children an family with an easy to use camera (like my old finepix 3800)--this wasn't it.", "Date": "November 25, 2007"}, {"Title": "FUJIFILM DIGITAL CAMERA", "Author": "Gerald J.

It has all the features, and more, that I was looking for at a reasonable price. I have had the camera a little over a month. I have been taking a lot of pictures and getting used to the new camera. It takes great pictures with a little practice. Everything was great until I was going to take a picture, I turned the knob on top of the camera to select the setting, and the knob fell off! No pressure was used! The knobs are extremely cheap. I called Fuji service department, they were very nice. Informed me I had to send my camera in for warrenty repair. They told me to send it, insured and trackable. I took it to the local Post Office and the Post master saw that I was sending it to the FujiFilm Repair Center and they said I can not insure the camera due to it is broken. So I mailed the camera back thru UPS which cost almost $17. So now I am without my camera for 2-3 wks and didn't get such a good deal after paying shipping.

First, Amazon promised free shipping. Then it recanted and charged close to $50 to ship to Spain. No surprise, but please be honest and up front. Second, Amazon promised a free Fujifilm 2GB xd memory card with the purchase, just plug in the promotional code, as Amazon calls it. I did. Twice and with the same result. Your code doesn't work. Well, it's the same damn number Amazon uses. And finally, there's the custom's tax deposit. This appears a sham. Because Amazon doesn't credit buyer with unused fees charged, and normally, according to my expat friends living here, there is typically none. That means another nearly $60 goes to Amazon in a hidden deposit account. Ever hear of fraud, Amazon? I was forced to buy only because I wanted this camera and could not get it here. Amazon Export Sales should be civily prosecuted for the tax deposit sham.
