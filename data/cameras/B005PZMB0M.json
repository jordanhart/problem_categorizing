It works well, and takes great pictures.  It was shipped in a timely fashion, and I am really, really, happy with it.  The price was phenominal!  And I just can't say enough about how happy I am with the whole deal.  I would recommend that if anyone can't afford a brand new camera, try out a used one.  They are just as good.", "Date": "April 16, 2013"}, {"Title": "Affordable Price, Full Featured , Durable & Handy.", "Author": "saini", "ReviewID": "R2CLMTGDMS8ILL", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I Really love my GE W1200 Digital Camera.

I wanted a camera like my brother has because I liked the simplicity and ease in which it took great pictures.

It worked for about 2 years and one day it just stopped. Even with new batteries, it will not come on. I last used the camera in 2008 and to this day it puzzles me why the camera will not come on. There was no damage done to the camera, it was shut down like normal but will not work. I question the quality of products that GE produce after this purchase, I will not purchase anymore GE products. It was a good $65 purchase but the stop functioning for no reasons knocks off stars.", "Date": "November 21, 2011"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": "$42.99", "Features": null, "Name": "GE W1200 2.5\" LCD Digital Camera 12.2MP 3X Optical Zoom - Black [Camera]", "ImgURL": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/21WZFAFJM9L._SY300_.jpg", "ProductID": "B005PZMB0M"}}
