{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Great bag", "Author": "the donut man", "ReviewID": "R1FW8MMJV6M60C", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I used an ameribag for many years until the shoulder strap delminated so I was in the market for a sling type bag that would zip closed. I bought a NEX bundle from Sony that came with a lunch pail bag which isn't really functional for me out on the trail. This bag is pretty awesome for my use. It fits the camera and a couple bottles of water along with the rest of my junk. I actually wear it in front, across my chest so I have quick access to the camera. Wild things are fast so even though it looks really stupid, wearing it backwards works great.  This bag offers a great value. It is functional and the zippers and materials seem very durable. There are cheaper bags but this is the style that I need to protect the camera, have easy access to it and not have to carry multiple things when I am exploring out in the woods. The ameribag would always slide around when I bent over but this bags rectangular shape makes it easier to hold it back with your elbow. Real world functionality.  Ppl say 'the best camera is the one you have with you' and now that is not my phone camera. And yes, it is this bag that makes the camera more enjoyable/useful because I can take the mirrorless camera with me....without worry. It pays to be cool and slow around bears, always keeping eye contact, but boars are aggressive. It is best to run which isn't possible with a full bodied dslr strapped around your neck.  I bought this off amazon though ALEXIOUS Japan and received it within a few days. Crazy fast. Faster than any other item I have ordered from the pacific rim. Even apple. They have a few odd Sony items that are interesting and not readily available stateside. Read the descriptions though. Like the NEX camera covers might be a separate top and bottom....and what fits what with which lens.  The bag;  Expensive, yes but well worth the price for my use.  The seller; I was impressed by the delivery time so I will be buying from this seller again.", "Date": "July 4, 2013"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": null, "Features": null, "Name": null, "ImgURL": null, "ProductID": "B005JFWKR2"}}
