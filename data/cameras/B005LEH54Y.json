{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Works Just As Intended", "Author": "PhantomArcher \"Tyler Moore\"", "ReviewID": "R5YFQSSIJ2NQQ", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "These video balun connectors are the perfect solution for CCTV systems that use Cat5 cable. Cat5 used with these baluns is great for distances siamese cables are otherwise not practical to reach. The baluns are packaged in pairs, which is perfect, as the standard run will require two units. The pressure contact connectors make connections incredibly simple requiring minimal tools (only to strip the Cat5 conductor). No detectable losses or signal degradation when using these make them the most ideal balun to use.", "Date": "July 30, 2012"}, {"Title": "Cheap baluns did the trick", "Author": "igen \"igen\"", "ReviewID": "R3QR24JMVD2ODJ", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I couldn't believe what a ripoff the siamese cables were for my security cameras, so I bought these baluns and some other cheap power connectors that screw onto CAT5 wire the same way.  I ran the CAT5 cable, screwed the connectors onto each end, and plugged everything in.  They did the trick, and the picture quality seems about just as good as with the old Siamese cable.", "Date": "October 5, 2013"}, {"Title": "Works Perfectly", "Author": "Regan222", "ReviewID": "R1FGQSX230B2E8", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I have currently 4 high quality cameras (700 TVL) running to a DVR and all are connected via these balun.
