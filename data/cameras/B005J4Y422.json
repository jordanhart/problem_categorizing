However i have found that it is similar in many ways to the Canon AE-1 that I have used for 30+ years. The exception is the the camera does all the focusing, all you need to do is point. Of course it has many more capabilities that are too numerous to mention here but I highly recommend the Canon 60D.", "Date": "January 22, 2012"}, {"Title": "Great Value, Great Customer Service!", "Author": "Gordon M.

Having said that, this kit is awesome.  I am a photojournalist.  With 1080 dpi movie capability at 60 fps there is little I cannot capture.  The multiple lens package covers most needs very effectively.  The camera's firmware capability is out of this world.  It can even produce, automatically, a step-up and step-down trio of shots with one pull of the trigger.  On the fly cababilities are incredible, including an Automatic Focus Servo that can track a moving subject for multiple shots in different focal planes.I could go on for quite some time.

This kit is the kit to get if you're wanting to start a photography hobby. There are more options on the 60D than there are the Txi models regardless of having the same sensor so, in all reality, you're not going to need to upgrade this camera unless you're doing exposures that require a MkII or better. Lenses aren't top of the line but if you do not have the 50mm lens that comes in this kit then it's worth getting. The lens is cheap but a very good lens and should be in everyone's camera case that owns a Canon. The telephoto lens performs sub par in my opinion and the 18-55 zoom is a good standard lens for really any situation. The carrying backpack holds everything that comes with the kit. It's not the best carrier and I do wish it had an extra zipper pocket on the front, but it serves it's purpose.Cons: The tripod that comes with this kit is trash. It's small and portable and fits on the side of the carrier nicely but I cannot think of any reason why I would break it out and set it up. It would be much more to your advantage to carry a chain around with a bolt on the end so you have a portable monopod that works off tension by holding it to the ground with your foot while pulling the camera up to your eye for quick situations that something like this would be needed for. The tripod is pretty useless unless you don't have one, in which case get one because you'll hate the one in the kit.Other than that, no complaints. You get what you pay for and the price is respectable for everything that comes in this kit. You probably won't find a 2 lens kit for any cheaper.

In fact, all of the Canon stuff in this package I would highly recommend. Almost everything else, No. The cheap memory included failed within the year, I have not heard back from the manufacturer after sending it back under warranty. The memory card reader also has difficulties staying mounted on my computer. The tripod is pretty cheap, if you are seriously considering buying a prosumer camera, you should definitely be buying a better tripod. The lens selection and lens adaptors was poorly though through, as the 50mm lens has a 52mm filter size not the 58mm filter size of the other lenses. You really have no need of a 2x adaptor if the kit comes with a 75-300mm lens. And you would be better off with one really nice polarizing filter instead of all the cheap ones included. I give it four stars just because the Canon stuff alone justifies the price and I am happy overall with the purchase.

My Canon video cameras have dead pixels also, but there's no way fix that in those cams.

It didn't hold up for more than about 45 days of regular but light use. However, I knew that going into this and was already planning on getting another bag. The placement of the singular zipper makes the bag a little awkward for switching lenses. It also allows for your camera or gear to potentially fall out...

I do wish it had come with a better in between lens, but I am more than happy with everything that came with the package.  An unbeatable price for sure.  I am still in the process of trying everything out!  A great camera over all.I love that it came with an extra battery which I have not even needed yet.  The camera is not too heavy but feels solid in my hands.  Still learning all the bells and whistles but from what I have used so far I would highly recommend this camera to anyone who is taking a jump to an EOS camera.  The colors are vibrant and crisp.  I love to photograph flowers and birds and this camera does produce a beautiful finished product.  Am having lots of fun trying everything out.  Still have not used the extended flash and tripod, but will use them when I go camping next week.  I would recommend this product to anyone!The battery life has been impressive with the number of shots I have taken and it still has half the battery life left.  The speed in which the battery charges is also great.Filming movies was such a snap the first time that I did not realize I was recording and recorded more than I thought!.  Beautiful videos.I have only had the camera two weeks so far, but compared to my old camera, which is a Kodax Max, which has also been a great camera for the money, I have lots to learn yet.  I still need to try out the filters and special lens.  I also have only used all automatic settings so far.  I am sure I will do lots of experimenting next week with all the lenses and filters.  Maybe a better review will follow after more experience.The download of the software and usage is very easy also.  I can't believe how fast the camera downloads all the photos and the options you have.  Another great thing with this camera.

It was packed with care and all was good; however, the tripod is not as strong as I thought it would be, the memory card was supposed to be a 32GB, I received a 16GB - I would've returned it but I'm out of the country now- the memo card is acting up a little. Everything seems really delicate and too fragile for me to handle, I feel like I'm going to break something. And the backpack is great,but it's not as big as I imagined it: it fits all the camera's lenses and accessories, keeping it full, no pocket for the tripod or space for the flash. Other than that, it's a great deal! Everything was new. BUY IT WHILE IT'S STILL THERE!I also want to thank my father's friend for carrying the camera all the way to my country.

I have now learned that this is just the design of the camera, so you just have to get used to having your thumb over that part if holding it, or else, your thumb will have a tendency to catch the edge and cause it to peel.  If not for that point, I would give 5 stars, especially since Canon products have always been phenomenal for me.  Hopefully, Canon will take a look at this, but I wouldn't hold my breath (I did contact their support, but they just said send it back for repair--it is not broken, it is a minor design flaw).  In addition, when I received the original bundle, a video LED light was sent by mistake, but I contacted Big Mike's Electronics, and they sent the correct shoe mount flash (and even let me keep the LED light at no charge)!
