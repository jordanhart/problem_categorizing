{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Works OK", "Author": "Abe M. \"Abe\"", "ReviewID": "R1XU2A2CBM163Y", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "When I received this camera the light didn't work. When I opened the housing I saw that a wire was disconnected from the light, a misc screw was magnetized to the motor and part of the plastic bracket for a gear was broken. I was not happy. I contacted the seller and they sent a new one at no extra charge. The camera worked but the sensor barely works. I mounted this outside. A few trucks have set it in motion if they are big enough and close enough. Otherwise you have to get right up to the sensor to get it to detect anything. Other than that they will do the trick and at least make people question whether they are being recorded or not.", "Date": "March 15, 2013"}, {"Title": "Gets their attention, but", "Author": "Andy Valentine", "ReviewID": "R9AG95X4U62RU", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "First glance, they believe it's a security camera. Quick second glance I believe most will realize that is not a real camera. I thought about hanging it outside, and my intentions were no good, I wouldn't be too concerned about it.Picked up a low cost, real camera for basic security. Hung this one in my office, and have received a lot of attention, good attention. Great conversation starter in cube city!It was well worth the $ for entertainment value.", "Date": "December 22, 2012"}, {"Title": "cheap but what can you expect for $10.00", "Author": "Chris Tice \"Ambassador with ViSalus Sciences\"", "ReviewID": "R214KL4GNXPZJQ", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "This was a great idea but the motion detector is too sensitive. It basically won't stop. Therefore I had to turn it off and just use it as a decoy. Plus it comes directly from China so it takes a long time. Plus the movement of the camera is too fast and cycles too many times back and forth. It would be better for this product if the red light stayed on all the time and no motion detection.", "Date": "December 31, 2013"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": "$11.09", "Features": "Built-in motion detection sensor.
