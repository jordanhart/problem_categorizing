My 70-200 2.8 USML is a fantastic lens but it's huge (not to mention HEAVY) and therefore intimidating - not ideal for candid shots.Enter the Lumix DMC-GM1, it produces very good images, is customizable,  light and TINY.  It's by no means a replacement for the full frame DSLR but the image quality is FAR superior to that of my cell phone's camera (iPhone 5s).There's a saying about cameras - \"The best camera is the one you have with you\".This one is always in my pocket.UPDATE:I've had the camera for about two weeks now and I love it!That said and though it's very easy to use on full auto, the GM1 is more geared to enthusiasts than beginners, it is highly customizable and delivers very good quality, even at high ISO (Compared to cell phones or point and shoot cameras).In order to capitalize on the best feature of this mighty-mite - interchangeable lenses.  I just purchased the Lumix 14mm f2.5 prime and have been pleasantly surprised by the image quality it delivers.At under $400 the images are very crisp and the lens is very POCKETABLE.Though it's a fixed focal length I'd say it's a step up from the 12-32mm f3.5-5.6 kit lens which came with the camera.  What is lost in zooming is gained in aperture.This camera and the impending Lumix GH4 are making me take a closer look at M4/3 as a viable replacement for my cumbersome full frame DSLR and heavy glass.How great to be able to use the same lenses on both a semi-pro level DSLR AND a pocket shooter.Well done Panasonic!", "Date": "March 18, 2014"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": null, "Features": null, "Name": null, "ImgURL": null, "ProductID": "B00FYO8U9K"}}
