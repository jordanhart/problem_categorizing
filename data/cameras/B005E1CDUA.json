{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Difficult to use as nannie spy device.", "Author": "Charles Of New York \"Charles\"", "ReviewID": "R2ZU1TCHU7IGPQ", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "Expensive, for me I could not get the nanny cam the ads promised me.  The instructions up and down cover there AM FM radio, but the spy part is not covered.  You are on your own with obscure nanny cam files  and old computer cables.  The unit is not up to date.Personally, I could not find out the mystery of how the nanny camera works except I did mange to get some strange, never before experienced video still files.It come with some old fashioned cables for pc viewing and I did see some pictures on my PC. In short it is a radio first  and the spy camera part is too wild for me to understand. I plan to give it to Good Will as a tax write off.", "Date": "April 7, 2014"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": null, "Features": null, "Name": null, "ImgURL": null, "ProductID": "B005E1CDUA"}}
