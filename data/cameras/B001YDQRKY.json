{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Best Surveillance Hidden Camera I've ever bought!", "Author": "R. Sandel", "ReviewID": "ROI9JCJ6UZUHZ", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I got to admit I was cautious about buying this hidden cameras as to how it/they would work for example, and what had to be used to actually record, plus how long a recording would be possible....... All I can say now after owning this for a little over a month now is \"WOW-WOW-WOW and WOW\" I never expected this little camera to be as good, as powerful and as easy to use and setup, and even view what was recorded as it is!!!!Gee I can set it up to record for several days at a time and the best part is, it is all self contained in the unit.Some pinhole cameras need something like a recorder to do the work recording which can be an issue all by itself running the wire or even wireless signals between the units can distort some video signals, this unit has no audio and really in a security camera that's not really needed, this Defender Stealth1 has a Color pinhole camera and without audio to take up memory can be setup to record for about 30 some odd days, but the bigger Memory card you use the longer it will record, gee you can record continuously for 6 months to a year if maybe longer if need be, just think about how many VHS tapes you would need to record using a VCR for example, plus this is self contained that you can use long life battery's in or even short life AA(double A) for quick places you need surveillance, it also comes with a cord you can plug in to 110V house current if one is available, but if your out in the woods, or in a tent out in the middle of NO-Where, where there is no electricity; your hidden camera would still work, all you need is maybe extra memory cards as you needed to keep and store what you recorded, unless you had a really large memory card I might should add. You can also plug the memory card into most Laptops and view what you recorded and/or edit it by removing chunks(Blank spots if you will) from the memory card so your action stays closer together if you will.  I'm really impressed that something like this didn't cost more!!!12/10/2009 from Mesa, Arizona", "Date": "December 10, 2009"}, {"Title": "Works as described", "Author": "Richard Bogan", "ReviewID": "RZAMLIA1CGAUS", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "A bit funky control wise but once you put the camera in place & record it's worth the price. SD card mates with my laptop & easy to merge the 10 second clips. I play back through the big screen tv & VGA quality is OK - clear enough. I wish they had a similar model that recorded sound with the clip.", "Date": "August 1, 2011"}, {"Title": "great product", "Author": "Deborah R Clegg", "ReviewID": "R14LQ9646JG5KC", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Great Product!
