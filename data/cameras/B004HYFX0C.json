{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Never going back to my DSLR!", "Author": "old arkiedan", "ReviewID": "R15GAZ6GVC3KHY", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I beat my brains out for the past month, trying to decide on a P&S; camera to replace my Pentax DSLR. I've decided, rather late in life, to go with a small pocket camera to replace my bulky SLR and several lenses, including the huge camera bag I carried them around in. So I've been reading every review and scanning every consumer review site (such as Amazon's) searching for the perfect P&S; camera. I even bought (and returned) two cameras that ultimately did not work for me. I agonized over the HX9V for a couple weeks before finally biting the bullet and ordering it. I'm extremely happy I did!From the moment I opened the box I knew the HX9V was going to be a winner. Unlike the two cameras I returned, the size and handling of the HX9V was about perfect for me. The two I returned were simply too small to handle efficiently, even in my relatively small hands, but this one was ideal (for me) with a great grip and controls that seemed to fall right under my fingers. The build quality is excellent and I can find no flaw in fit and finish. I decided I wanted a mode dial on top, like my SLRs always had (the two I returned used the wheel on the back of the camera), and the HX9V has one, although it's a little difficult gripping it. So, in short, the HX9V first impression is supurb!This camera does not come with an accessory battery charger (an omission I find rather annoying) so I ordered one, along with a couple spare batteries (the two batteries and the charger cost only $14.00, shipped). I charged the Sony battery in the camera, using the provided power adapter (again, a ridiculous system, since it ties up the camera during charging) and charged the two spares in the tiny little accessory charger. Everything was charged in a couple of hours and I was ready to put this little gem through it's paces.Operationally, the camera exceeds all of my expectations. First, I've never owned such a long zoom and this thing is terrific, although I doubt I'll use the long end very often. Having used large SLR zooms most of my photographic life, where zooming was done manually, I found this zoom rather slow, a bit gravelly-feeling and hard to control precisely. It requires some getting used to, at least for me anyway, but I believe it will be fine.Focusing is instantaneous and I experience no lag-time, unless shooting in modes that shoot and blend multiple images together. On those you get the obligatory \"Processing\" message and, frankly, I see no reason to consider that a negative. The camera is doing some truly sophisticated image blending. Shoot in a single image mode and it's operation is lightning fast. Oh, and did I mention the ability to shoot ten images a second? What a great feature when shooting my dog, Sammy, or a sports event (and yes, you will get the \"Processing\" message after firing off ten shots).The Panorama feature is great, producing beautiful wide panoramic images. I've found it really difficult to get less than stellar panos. In other words, it's real hard to mess up!Video is an area I've never explored before but, after seeing some of my random efforts on my HD TV, I'm completely dazzled by this camera's abilities. This is an area I intend to pursue further.There are many more special features that I wont go into here but they're all great and very useful. As for the 3-D thing, I have no interest in that but many others will. I can't comment because I don't care about it.Image quality! You read about it. You scan full-size images on dozens of websites. You pixel-peep endlessly, comparing images from Canon, Nikon, and Sony, until your head feels like it's going to explode. If you're an intelligent, sensible person you conclude that much of the hype you read around the internet is just that - hype! Every P&S; camera out there has shortcomings in one area or another and none produce results like a good DSLR! After I came to that conclusion I felt more confortable ordering the Sony. I'm glad I did. I have no intention of blowing any of these images up to poster size. Most will never be printed and those that are will likely be \"normal\" print sizes. This camera produces excellent images! I have a relatively discerning eye after over fifty years of photography and I'll say again; the Sony HX9V produces excellent images!The bottom-line is, this camera is chock full of cutting edge technology, with features that put it far out front of most other P&S; cameras. It takes great images and the videos are extraordinary.Mine is a keeper! It's going to be around for many years to come. In fact, it might outlast me, since I'm 73.Update: April, 2012Everything I said in the above review stands, in spades, after all these months. That said, I finally taught my wife how to use this camera a couple weeks ago and she took it to one of her DAR conventions. She returned two days later and downloaded several hundred images to her computer. Later, when I watched over her shoulder while she scanned them individually I realized they were all, I mean all, extremely soft, unlike my own results. She seemed happy with them but I knew otherwise so I asked her to go out in the yard with me and take a few shots. We did and I immediately saw her problem. She repeatedly composed the picture on the LCD screen and immediately snapped the shutter, without waiting for the camerea to complete focus. She had forgotten that she should depress the button halfway to allow the autofocus system to work properly. Well, long story longer, she did as I demonstrated and we reviewed the pictures on her computer.Voila! The shots were now sharp and clean. Funny thing was: she then looked at her efforts at the convention and said, \"Oh! These are awful!\" After this episode I'm convinced that many of the complaints about soft images is a result of \"Operator Error.\" No offence but ain't that always the way.By the way, there are several comments attached to this post, one by a fellow who doesn't own the camera and who obviously has an agenda. His first negative post even implied, in a smarmy, underhanded way, that my review is worthless because I once used Pentax cameras, ignoring the fact that Pentax has earned, over the years, an excellent reputation. He has gone on to point out certain professional reviews that are unfavorable to the camera, ignoring those that heap accolades on it. I frankly, could not care less about his opinions but I will bet that I've been shooting images for more years than he's been alive. Anyway, as I said in the review, it's my opinion, and can be ignored completely if one chooses to do so. If you own this fine camera, enjoy!arkiedan", "Date": "August 1, 2011"}, {"Title": "Impressive zoom, photo quality, panoramic mode and video", "Author": "Robin", "ReviewID": "RIWNTGUG9L5OY", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "From my personal experience in the last 2 weeks since I received Sony's HX9V camera:Overall I am happy with my purchase and consider that Sony's camera is competitive compared with similar offerings available from other manufacturers (see below).Pros- Wide angle lens and optical zoom (16x) are great: 24mm to 384mm in 35mm film equivalent- Excellent clear display (3\", 921k)- Great panoramic mode - you sweep the camera around in one motion and it makes a single photo. You can sweep up and down too if the focal length doesn't change too much.- Generally good photo quality for a pocket megazoom camera.- Can easily fit in a jacket pocket or squeeze in a trouser one (camera is 4.2 x 1.4 x 2.4 inches ; 8.6 ounces)- Video stabilizer is exceptionally good and quality is decent too- GPS records your location- Reasonably quick start-up for photo shooting - about 1 second- Works fine with the 16 GB SDHC Class 10 card I have (I believe Class 6 works fine too)- Auto backlight correction helps to get details with difficult lighting- Background defocus mode can produce some dramatic results.- Reasonable battery life - about 240 photos and some short videos.Cons- Slow to change between photo modes or video/photo mode - about 7 seconds - you may miss the moment!- Colors can appear too saturated on the display- Colors can also be a bit saturated on the photos, but using 'P' mode and 'natural' colors helps. Also, reducing color saturation in the 'P' mode can help reduce yellow color in low light.- Photo review zoom in is slow to get going.- GPS can be a bit slow to find you and it only gives lat/long info, not location name as some other GPS camera systems do.- Flash can be a bit bright leading to overexposure if objects are close with a dark background. (also happened with my last 2 point and shoot digital cameras by other manufacturers). Slow sync flash can help, but camera needs to be held very steady to avoid blurring.- Video start button is a bit small but works ok when you get used to it.- Pop up flash can be annoying. You have to remember to hold the camera differently to avoid having your finger on top of it. Also, whenever you ask someone else to take an indoor photo, you have to warn them about the flash and how to hold the camera.- Video is great but eats up your memory card! High quality fills 16 GB in less than 1 hr. Might be worth getting a second 16 GB card or a larger card if you plan to do much video in the high quality setting.From reading reviews, alternatives compact ultra-zoom cameras I considered buying were:- Canon PowerShot SX230 HS - high photo quality, 14x optical zoom, 3\" 460k display, more manual controls, but it also has a pop-up flash, is a bit slow start on start-up and has a short battery life. Wide angle lens is 28mm equivalent, so not as wide as the HX9V's 24mm.- Ricoh CX3 - High photo quality (not over-saturated tendencies like Sony, nor grainy tendencies like Panasonic), excellent macro mode, 10.7x optical zoom, 3\" 920k display, 10 megapixel, but no manual controls and cannot zoom beyond 2.8x during filming.- Panasonic ZS10 (or TZ20) - 16x optical zoom, 24mm equivalent wide-angle, quick start-up, 3\" 460k display, GPS gives name of location, flash is not pop-up (good), but photo quality is average, battery life is not so good and worse with GPS on, the touch screen only does some functions while other have to be done with buttons in a strange mixture.", "Date": "June 15, 2011"}, {"Title": "Great camera but not perfect (but then, what is?)", "Author": "Thomas Hyatt", "ReviewID": "RFMG5TFGXJ7D0", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I have been searching for a good, pocket-able travel zoom camera for a few months and have looked at a number of different models including the Fujifilm 550exr. I settled on the Sony for its specs and the reputation that Sony has for making state-of-the-art cameras. I have to say I have not been disappointed. I am most interested in the out-of-the-box image quality since I know that on most occasions my approach is to take a series of shots without too much fuss and let the camera do most of the work for me. This is certainly the case when I am traveling since I am usually trying to get the most of the experience I am having rather than focusing too much on tinkering with camera controls.So I compared the images from the HX9V to a Sony NEX5 and to an older Panasonic. I used the IA settings on all three cameras. I have to say I was very pleased with the results. The HX9 gave consistently good images from its Intelligent Auto and Superior Auto modes that in some cases came close to the shots from the NEX5. Where it could not compete (and this makes perfect sense because of the different sizes of the image sensor) was in low light. Not that the HX9 didn't have pretty good low-light capability, but it just could not pull the shadow details of color clarity of the NEX5. What was always interesting to me in comparing the images was how sharp and crisp the images were from the HX9. Moving closer to the pixel level it was apparent that this came at the expense of overall smoothness of the image, particularly in shadows and at the edges where images elements came together. However, in many cases, the overall visual detail and contrasts in the shadow areas of pictures taken in daylight was surprisingly good and rivaled the NEX5 for clarity. Where things got a little ugly was in the shadow areas of images taken in low light. But overall, I was very impressed with the flexibility of the camera and how balanced the photos generally were.So here is my check list of pros and cons:Pros:- Stunning display with beautiful color and resolution- very crisp images with vibrant color- great zoom, good sharpness at all levels of zoom- nice menu system, easy to use. Great display makes menus seem even better- good controls (except for on/off button which is a little too flat/small)- lots of fun and useful image and shooting options- smooth and easy image scrolling in playback- nice feel to body, very well constructed, scroll wheel and buttons have a quality feel- nice options for multiple/burst shots of image to increase image fidelity/clarityCons- a little chunky for a true pocket/travel camera- don't like the in-camera charging method. What's the benefit in that?- slight lag in zoom/review of in-camera images- Extra sharpness of images comes at some cost to smoothness", "Date": "April 26, 2011"}, {"Title": "Perfect Concert Point-and-shoot camera - Finally!", "Author": "D. Brodsky", "ReviewID": "RUWD6M4I4PJK7", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Background:  I am an advanced amateur photographer.  I have owned most of Canon/Nikon DSLRS in the last 10 years.  I shoot with Full Frame Nikon D700, and have shot with Every Nikon DSLR except D3s.  I have thousands of dollars invested in lenses.  I also shoot with Canon 7D, and i have shot with every recent Canon DSLR including 5DM2.  I have owned in excess of 30 point-and-shoot and bridge cameras over the last 10 years.  I am also a pixel-peeper and I am very critical.  So this is not a review from someone who has never shot with anything but a Canon elph.  My current point-and-shoots are Panasonic ZS3 and LX3 and Sony TX1.If you don't have a media pass, they will not let you in to concert arenas with DSLR gear in 99% of arenas/venues.  But they will most of the time let you in with a smaller point-and-shoot.  Many venues have a photography policy of  \"personal cameras with non-removable lenses' only.The key to taking pictures from your seat at a concert are:1) large zoom - unless you can afford front row seats2) fast autofocus in low light - this one is big3) good metering so the camera won't constantly blow out performers faces4) shutter speed priority - don't even bother without it5) decent battery life - or multiple batteries.With that in mind, the last decent small point-and-shoot camera that could have been used for that purpose was PANASONIC ZS3 (TZ7 in Europe).  While no manual mode, you can kinda work around the issue by being able to set a minimum shutter speed.  Before it, it was Panasonic TZ5.  I owned Panasonic TZ3, TZ5, and ZS3.  As everyone know, after ZS3, all the subsequent models in that series sucked.  In fact they have gotten worse and worse.  Finally dpreview, dcresource, and other sites acknowledged it.  You can read reviewed of the latest panasonics in that series - the image quality went to crap.ZS3 was decent, but it did not have shutter priority mode, and its battery life wasn't great and its 25-300 zoom was probably good in 2009, but we are in 2011.I've done extensive research including reading all the professional reviews, with paying specific attention to things I cared about, like autofocus speed at full tele, etc.  It was between this Sony and Canon 230.  Canon 230 has two key problems, one - slow autofocus in low light and small battery life.  Canon point-and-shoots are known for slow autofocus;  I once bought their heralded S95, and promptly returned it in couple of days, after it refused to autofocus in nightclub settings: I should have read the reviews on that point.  Whats the point of good ISO performance if your camera cannot focus?  Slow af or no af and your subject gets frustrated, or you lose a moment.  Fast AF Speed is the key to many types of photography.Imaging-resource reviews are helpful, as they actually test and check AF speeds at wide and tele and in low light.  HX9 speeds are twice as fast as Canon SX230.  I also knew going in that when looking at 100%, with Sony I will see smearing and all the other unpretty things; it would be like Pixel peeping Fuji FXX cameras.  But with 16MP, I figured I won't need to pixel-peep that often, and if you don't at 100%, it is not bad.I bought this camera and thoroughly tested it.  I took it to a recent rock concert where I was sitting all the way in the back.  I am happy the report that this camera is a little gem.  Amazing!Autofocus speed was superb at tele end.  Ability to set a shutter speed in Manual Mode was super helpful.  I setup the custom button as ISO which gave me a one button ISO access.  I took 450 photos and 10 videos of lengths from 1 to 5 minutes.  My battery only lost one out of three bars.  That is 450 photos.  Yes you may say that flash is not used in this type of photography.  But using continuous autofocus depletes battery too, and I was still able to take 450 photos.  Please note that I also did not turn on GPS.  I know it depletes batteries.  In fact, using GPS will deplete your cell phone too.  I don't see a need for me to know exact longitude of where a particular photo was taken.  I know where the photo was taken.The photos came great, better than I usually would get with ZS3, and will less effort.I also have used the camera at daylight but who cares about that, all point-and-shoots are great at daylight, it does not tell you anything.  Abilities in low light, that is what separates boys from men.Odd things about this camera:1) no charger - like the Fuji F10/30/31 - you plug the camera in the wall to charge.  I've heard third party chargers exist2) no macro mode.  that is the first time I've ever handled a camera that does not have a dedicated macro mode/scene/button.  It does do macro, but it is automatic.  It took me a while to figure it out as I was looking for it.  It is odd3)  Going from one setting to another takes longer than in typical point-and-shoot.  Like going from camera to play mode, or going from one setting to another.  I knew it from the reviews beforehands.4)  I knocked off the star for Sony's handling of noise/digital artifacts when viewing at 100%.  Canon does better.  Or include RAW so I can deal with this myself in pp.So this is now officially my main point-and-shoot.  It does everything a point-and-shoot should.  It obviously won't replace my DSLRs, but it will accompany me often.", "Date": "September 10, 2011"}, {"Title": "HX9V packed with features but image quality could be improved", "Author": "michfan1", "ReviewID": "RCINIQ4F8ZI5O", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "I've been testing the camera for several days now, and whilst the features and technical aspects of the hx9V are great, I regret to say, I just couldn't get past the 'average' image quality.  This was the deal breaker for me.  Suffice it to say, it did not meet my total expectations; the camera was returned today.  Pictures of buildings, people, grass, trees, landscape shots, for example, all look a bit washed out (at times look hazy and smudgy), almost like a watercolor effect.  This is all due to Sony's aggressive NR software built into the camera, which has been noted by expert reviewers and actual owners of the HX9V. Buildings and flesh tones on caucasian skins, especially, look too smoothed out (aka over-processed appearance).  Don't get me wrong, pictures do come out pretty sharp in good lighting but they lack the punch to make the images pop and don't really retain strong details.  Pictures rather look flat and dull.  Furthermore, the white balance and color rendition are not really accurate (i.e. color red looks too red and fake).  Also beware when shooting pictures in the direction of the sun (not AT the sun), you will see the inevitable series of purple dots on your picture (i.e. building with the sun the backdrop).  This is not a manufacturer defect I was told, rather the way the lens was made by Sony.Burst speed is very impressive (one feature I'm really going to miss) but it comes at a sacrifice of having to wait several seconds before you can take another picture (longer if you always shoot at the highest 16 MP level).  This can get annoying because you might miss that \"money shot.\" Other positive features of the camera are the focusing speed (when you shoot in scene mode and choose action mode with high burst speed, the camera does an excellent job at freezing the moving subject in a series of shots - this will come very handy when shooting sporting events), panorama mode, background defocus mode, low light pictures (in good lighting; otherwise, expect to see a lot detail smudging and noise), and last but not least, the video.  If you are really into shooting a lot of videos, then you can't go wrong with the Sony HX9V.  The camera is well built, I have to admit.  A bit thick and heavy but aesthetically it looks very nice.FWIW: I ended up getting the Canon SX230, and I couldn't be happier with the decision.  The video feature may not be as good as the Sony's, but image quality is more important to me.", "Date": "May 29, 2011"}, {"Title": "Good Pocket Zoom, But Enter with Your Eyes Wide Open", "Author": "Ray \"A Reader\"", "ReviewID": "R1U2XKWC7UIZFG", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "The Sony DSC-HX9V is in many respects a truly remarkable camera. I've been using it for about three months now, and have had enough experience with it at this point to write up a short review that I hope will be helpful for others investigating this camera. Up front, I can sum up my feelings thus far by saying that the camera is a feature laden unit that cannot help but impress as regards the camera itself, but a couple of fairly significant issues are present that MAY make it become a second, not a first, choice amongst the many other cameras in its class.The HX9V is superbly built. The unit is manufactured in Japan, and holding it and using it makes that distinction apparent. The camera is tightly crafted out of high quality metals and plastics, and there is not a squeak, loose part, or wobbly dial anywhere. The buttons, knobs, and dials work tightly and decidedly. There is no hint of anything but high quality, and the impression is that the camera will likely stay tight and working well over time. The body feels as though crafted out a block of metal.Styling on the camera is also nice, if somewhat masculine, and the overall appearance is certainly eye-catching. The camera has a black color theme, with a semi-shiny black paint over alloy finish. A rubberized black grip is on the user's right of the camera. The tops and sides of the camera are finished with a very attractive, shiny, dark gray chromed finish. It's a beauty to look at.As for controls and access panels, a larger single command dial on the top right controls the main setting modes, with an immediately adjacent zoom toggle. A pop-up flash is on the top left. The zoom lens housing protrudes a significant 4mm or so in the camera's front (this camera will fit it most pants pockets, but its chunkiness may make it difficult in some cases). The lens itself protrudes a significant amount on highest zoom setting (remember, this is a whopping 16x zoom lens). A HDMI port (a real one) is beneath a panel on the right. Underneath, a single door opens to gain access to both battery and flash card. On the back of the camera, a controller wheel is used to access functions, and a number of buttons, some customizable, populate both the top and the back of the camera.The LCD screen on this camera is a real gem. At about 1 million pixels and 3 inches across, it vies with some of the leading DSLRs in screen quality (actually, to be more accurate, it is much BETTER than many DSLR's screens). The screen is a pleasure to use, and it will ruin you, too. Once you see what a screen can look like, many of your existing cameras -- even expensive ones -- will start to annoy you with their inferior displays. It is now an empirically demonstrable fact that most any camera can possess a screen like this, and if new cameras do not, they are using cost-cutting measures. Fingerprints, however, show easily on the screen, and cleaning it takes a little bit of effort.The camera is generally comfortable in your hand, in spite of its somewhat chunky design and slightly heavy weight. The rubberized grip works very well, and a rubberized thumb grip on the back provides an extra gripping surface for the one-hand shoot style. A small wrist strap is supplied, and which works fine. (But I must again castigate ALL camera manufacturers who simply refuse to include a wrist strap without the small, plastic securing slider to secure the strap to the wrist: my Canon Powershot S80 came with one of these seven years ago, and it costs only one cent to make the plastic slide which securely fastens the camera to your wrist even if you drop the camera. It is inexcusable that this design is not standard on all wrist straps. See one from Olympus at Olympus 202315 Adjustable Wrist Strap (Black).)Image quality is generally good, with the camera's strengths the ability to capture clean shots in low light and the image stabilization that seems to make even impossible shots sharp and in focus. Colors are rich and saturated. Outdoor shots can be a little overexposed at times, but the camera's computer-based scene recognition mode seems to know what to do at every turn. Macro shots are simply superb. Even though this camera does not have the F/2 or F/2.8 aperture of some of its competitors, the macro images this camera turns out are easily in league with even some DSLR's. This is truly a convergence device: it is more half camera and half computer than any I've seen yet.Video mode is excellent, with the camera knocking out true HD movies that could have normally only been made with dedicated camcorders. There are four movie modes with differential quality, but they all look good, and the camera just excels at video.So, what's the problem? Well, for many people, there will be no problem. This is a camera that you turn out, point, and shoot, and, in the majority of the cases, you'll get a good, usable photo. Then, on to the next. Or, shoot a HD video. There is no denying that this camera can be a lot of fun for the shooter, and one that can turn out some impressive feats.But there are, in my own mind, two issues on this camera that need to be mentioned, and that \"rain on the parade.\" These are, one, the slow operational speed of the camera during shooting in the IA+ mode and, two, the image quality of SOME of the shots when viewed at anything other than on a computer screen. The truth is that, when one takes a shot on the HX9V in IA+ mode, there is a significant lag between the shot and the ability to take a second shot (shows the \"processing ...\" message), and, depending on the circumstances, the lag can be quite pronounced. So pronounced that you are not going to sit there and just bang off one shot after another, but, rather, will have to adopt a process where wait time is factored into all you photo taking. Perhaps this is not a problem for some people, but I can assure you that, for me, it is as annoying as it is distracting (that is, it breaks my train of thought while I am trying to shoot, because I can't move onto another shot, but instead, have to look down to the camera and wait until it tells me its ready for a next shot). The problem is not so present when shooting in the IA mode, which also does a great job, but if you want to use all that fancy Sony automatic layering in your shots (where the camera instantaneously takes six shots and them layers them together to remove noise), you'll have to contend with this. However, this is the price we pay for this sophisticated \"convergence\" feature (even Sony's DSLR's that use this same technology have the same issue.)And as for image quality, yes, the shots are generally sharp and saturated. But there is a price to pay for the computer-based techniques the camera employs to achieve so many sharp shots under so many settings. You don't want to look too carefully at some of these shots (i.e., zooming them in to pixel-level viewing), because you may not necessarily like what you see. Some shots can also tend to be flat, and/or over processed looking. We can see that we are trading one fault for another. We generally get usable shots under most any condition, but the price can be seen in how some of these shots turn out. (There is no way to adjust noise reduction, and there is no RAW mode.)So, do I like this camera, or not? I do. Very much. In fact, there is a lot about the camera I really like. But I also think that one needs to consider the issues surrounding it before selecting it, particularly when there are so many other fine alternatives available today. If you just want to knock out generally good shots under a wide variety of circumstances, and never \"pixel peep,\" you'll be happy, unless the IA+ delays drive you crazy (which they may). If you are looking for more control and want to post process photos with software, you, too, may not be completely happy with the images (while, though, you may, at the same time, nevertheless be impressed by the camera's build and features). Finally, if you are interested in macro shooting, your results can be incredibly good. That's the best way I can sum it up.Here's what I can see as Pros and Cons at this point, now that I've provided that preamble:PROS:+ Huge feature set of computer-based functions+ Extremely fast auto focus (nearly instantaneous in many settings)+ Superior display screen with 1 million pixels (bright, colorful, and sharp)+ Video quality that is startlingly (and I mean, ASTOUNDINGLY, SHOCKINGLY) good - almost rivals professional video cameras+ Steady Shot works during VIDEO recording, as well as photo shooting+ Generally good image quality under a wide range of shooting settings+ Excellent macro performance that can rival DSLR's+ Very good zoom range, from a very wide (24mm) to a high zoom+ Sony \"G\" lens is optically very nice+ Comfortable, secure gripping surfaces+ High quality construction that one can feel and see+ Uses either SDHC or Memory Stick cards+ Gorgeous user interface with built-in help system+ Dedicated movie button+ Panoramic stich mode that works impressively well+ Built-in GPS that can also be switched off, if desired+ USB charging of batteries permits charging from a computer's USB port+ Reasonable price point for what you getCONS- Delays/lags/pauses during shooting in IA+ may be a complete deal breaker, in spite of all other positives (although other reviewers point out this is a problem only in Superior Auto mode)- Image quality, while generally good, does not always stand up to detailed scrutiny (\"pixel peeping\")- Videos may not easily play on all computers (AVCHD format)- A tad heavy and chunky for a travel zoom- Battery life not great (you're going to need extra batteries, and they aren't cheap, either)- Batteries are charged in-camera, and charging is slow, slow, slow (270 minutes for full charge)- No external battery charger provided, and can be an expensive accessory (up to $60, retail)- No RAW mode shooting- On/off power button a bit difficult to engage- Move record/stop button difficult to engage (and makes all your movies have a movement bump as you try to access the button)- Limited Mac software supportSo, is it a five star camera? It depends on the type of use you are. If you fall into the category of someone who wants generally good photos under a wide set of settings and never pixel peeps, you'll have here a camera that can meet that goal admirably, and you'll be able to get very good sets of photos that you'll be happy to view and share (assuming you can handle the lag between shots). If you need something that won't annoy you with performance lags, do a lot of post processing, or want lots of custom control over your shooting, the HX9V is not your camera. It's not that it is not a technical wonder -- it truly is -- but it's not likely going to work for you. I've owned many, many Sony cameras over the years (F707, F717, F828, R1, a33, and a host of Sony compacts) and I can say this camera shows Sony's commitment to moving the technology forward. But those caveats listed above may be deal breakers for you. Examine your needs carefully before you buy.Five stars for the casual photographer who wants nice photos with little hassle. Four stars for most others.Additional Comments (Three Months after the Initial Review, Above)After using this camera for about three months, I can say without hesitation that the strengths of this camera is that it can knock out decent images in a wide variety of settings without too much user intervention. You have to make a \"pledge\" to yourself to not pixel-peep, because these images are often not going to be, at pixel-level, up to what you might expect from a DSLR, but its true that the images that come from this camera, when looked at full screen, can often be stunning. Another real strong point about this camera, and one that few people seem to be commenting about, is its macro capability. This camera will allow you to get within an inch or so of an abject, and then, if you are using the base of whatever the camera is sitting on (the table, the floor, etc.) as a \"tripod,\" you can take macro shots that just are impossible to believe. (This would seem to really make this a grade camera for museum use, when you are trying to get shots of items behind glass, and at short distance). Finally, and this is what others ARE talking about, is the incredible video quality of this camera. Videos shot here at the highest 1080 60p or 1080 60i seem to come from a dedicated cam corder, and, to boot, the steady shot function works during video, making video you take while walking appear as though they are from a movie. Some may purchase this camera for video alone, so good is this function. In all, this is a generally amazing camera, and seems to be the first barrage in what Sony will be doing in the coming years as they apply their electronics expertise to the development of photographic cameras.A Word on Batteries...Sony in this camera employs their trademark \"InfoLithium\" technology, which provides battery level feedback on the screen to tell you how much charge is left on the battery. The battery that comes with the camera, the \"NP-BG1\" will show a visual indication of remaining battery charge. If you purchase the Sony replacement battery, the \"NP-FG1\", the batteyr will provide BOTH the visual indicator AND the estimated remaining time IN MINUTES. Very cool. However, if you purchase a non-Sony aftermarket battery, it will provide neither of these (at least, not accurately), and you'll just have to estimate yourself. For these reasons, I highly recommend the Sony NP-FG1. See it at: Sony NP-FG1 Rechargeable Lithium-Ion Battery Pack for Select Digital Cameras. Supplement it with one or two of the off-brand models just as a third and/of fourth battery in case you go through the first two during a shooting session.", "Date": "July 31, 2011"}, {"Title": "The perfect, multi-talented, super-zoom, HD video, pocket-sized point-and-shoot camera!", "Author": "R. Cross", "ReviewID": "R3UGR5TT9EYPZA", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I got the HX9v as soon as it came out this spring.  It's pretty much the perfect, top-notch pocket point-and-shoot.  In fact, I carry it with me in my right-hand pocket at literally all times.  I have taken several thousand photos with it so far, and several hours of video.  I am very happy with my purchase.The video is amazing, with many options, zooming while shooting, stereo sound, great auto focus, fantastic in low light.  Keep in mind that for the highest quality setting, 1080p/60 fps AVCHD, if you want to view it on a Mac, you'll need to have the latest version of iMovie '11, running on at least the latest version of Snow Leopard (OS 10.6.8).  Of course, you can now upload these .MTS files directly to the various on-line sites such as Facebook, YouTube, and Google+/Picasa, and you can view them on your HDTV through the mini-HDMI out (which is great).  But for saving and viewing on the Mac, the AVCHD modes introduce a couple of extra steps and are not simple drag-drop-and-play.  If you don't have a Mac running the above specs, there are still some good workaround options out there.  After a lot of searching I found \"ClipWrap\" to be the best option for dealing with these files.  But overall, I can't say enough about just how fantastic the video on this camera is.  I've been hundreds of feet away at a concert in the dark, and taken footage that makes it look like I'm sitting right in front of the performer in a well-lit space.  With nice-quality stereo sound.  And all of this often on \"only\" the best 1080 MOV setting, not even dialing it up to the top-notch AVCHD.  It's amazing, really.The 16x zoom is fast and very good.  Things get a little noisy when you crop and zoom in on a shot that you took at maximum zoom (basically blowing up a shot to the center 1/9th of the frame after shooting at max zoom).  But that's to be expected.  16x is fantastic and I use this feature every single day for nature shots - particularly birds.There's also a very nice feature one turn of the dial from auto mode that mimics the shallow depth-of-field in DSLRs.  It takes two shots, blurs one, and then stitches the two together so that the subject is crystal-clear but the background is nicely blurred.  I have gotten some very nice shots of flowers and animals close up with this, though the subject does have to be pretty still for it to work right.Speaking of flowers, the macro capabilities of the auto modes on this camera are FANTASTIC.  Reason in itself to buy the camera.  I can be on a walk, with my very big dog pulling in one hand.  I'll see a very pretty flower and tell him to \"wait\" and \"sit\", while using my other hand to slide the camera out of my pocket and turn it on.  I just hold the camera up close, click, slide it back into my pocket, and we're off again.  Whole process takes maybe 2 seconds (unless I choose to take a couple of angles, etc.).  This has been the case for nearly every one of my \"local flowers\", \"Yosemite wildflowers\", and \"super macro\" shots in my Flickr account taken with this camera (basically everything shot in the past few months).  My Flickr handle is RobertCross1 if you'd like to check out any of my shots to see for yourself.I generally don't use the in-camera panorama features.  While they are certainly very good for what they are, you can get much better panoramic shots by shooting consecutive, overlapping stills and stitching them together in a software application like Photoshop Elements.I also don't use the in-camera HDR feature.  It just isn't very well implemented and produces pretty strange looking shots, even for HDR.  If you want HDR photos, you can exposure bracket with three shots in very quick succession (as this thing shoots at 10fps, a tripod is not even generally needed for this, as long as you have a fairly still hand), at -1, 0, and +1.  Not quite the range you'll get from a DSLR, but I've gotten some nice results putting them together in Photomatix.As for the battery charging in the camera situation, you can easily buy an external charger and a second and/or third battery.  Then charging the battery in the camera becomes a nice second option.  Do a quick search here on Amazon.  The one I got was an external charger and TWO extra batteries for a total of $11.16, and free shipping with Amazon Prime.  They're third-party, but work great.  In fact, they're better than the battery that came with the camera, as they actually show the time remaining next to the icon on the screen.  They say \"Fits Son. NP-BG1\" on them.The GPS is a nice feature.  When shooting at home and around town, I keep it turned off, to save battery power.  But it's good for road trips and hiking especially, when you're often shooting from a place along a trail that might not be marked on a map or easy to see in satellite view.  It does take a bit for the GPS to reconnect every time you turn the camera back on, so not great for quick pull-it-out-of-your-pocket-and-shoot situations.  But a nice thing to have.As with any point-and-shoot, there's a tendency in the auto modes to overexpose a bit in bright daylight settings.  Just be aware of this and make good use of the various manual settings \"P\" and the three \"M\" modes on the dial.  Also, the \"custom\" button on the top can be set for various things, but I've got it by default on exposure compensation.  So, if shooting in auto, I can make a couple of quick clicks to darken the scene until the sky goes from white to blue.  The changed setting resets when you turn the camera off, but it is really good for quick changes on the fly.  In manual shooting mode, however, the changes you make stay that way when you turn the camera off and on, which is great when you're out shooting a bunch of shots in similar light conditions.As for color, it's generally great, but the reds do tend to get overblown a bit.  Watch for that.  If shooting something predominantly red, you may want to shift to the R \"Real Color\" setting.  The default is standard, but there are \"Vivid\", \"Real\", \"Sepia\", \"BW\", etc. settings as well.My wife's camera, the Panasonic Lumix ZS3, which I was using before I got my Sony, is a wonderful point-and-shoot, and it may have a bit of a better lens, as it doesn't have the reds issue, and never introduced geometrical distortion around the edges of the shot.  The HX9v does do this a bit, but this is pretty standard for point-and-shoots, and is easily fixed in software in the very few instances where it becomes noticeable.But we're talking real fine-tuning stuff here.  In every other way, the HX9v blows away the Panasonic ZS3 (and ZS7 and ZS10, for that matter).  I'd say that the daytime image qualilty still is top-notch, and low-light shooting is on a completely different level.  I never, ever use the flash.  The two auto modes are both fantastic.  For most of my daytime shooting, I actually tend to stick with the regular auto (as opposed to the Superior Auto+) setting, as it is much, much faster.  This is because it doesn't use the various multi-shot-and-stitch-together-in-the-camera features that are only in Auto+.  In fact, in daylight settings, I don't want the chance of Auto+ selecting the HDR function and giving me a weird-looking shot.  And regular auto also gives you the option for continuous shooting with two clicks of the wheel, which is unavailable in Auto+.  It can do 10fps or 2fps at full size, which is AMAZING for a point-and-shoot.  But unlike a DSLR, the buffer is small, so after 10 shots, it has to process and save to the card.  I have a class 10 superfast card in it which speeds this up, but 10 still seems to be the limit of continuous shots per click-and-hold.  So I usually have it set at 2fps, which can give me up to 5 seconds of dog running or bird flight motion shots.Overall, a truly remarkable camera that was one of the best technology purchases I have ever made.  I would highly recommend it.There's a Flickr group devoted to this camera that you should check out.  My most recent ten or so shots on there are very near the top of the pool, and they give you a good idea of the range of the camera, from 16x zoom mountain shots to low-light concert stills, to very close-up macro.  Here's the link:[...]But if that gets disabled on Amazon, just do a search on Flickr for \"HX9v\".  It'll be right there at the top.  And here's a direct link to my Flickr photostream, if you want to poke around through what I've done with the camera.  Basically anything done since early May 2011 (and each shot tells you which camera it was shot with right above the map).  Keep in mind that Flickr is not the place for video (very poor compression with all kinds of artifacts - not representative of the camera), so don't even click on any of those.

I thought that I would pick the Panasonic DMC-ZS10 because it had everything that I wanted except for one fatal flaw: pictures in any condition but bright sunlight were very noisy. The Canon S95 is a great camera that takes superb pictures even in low light, but I wanted a 16x optical zoom and a 1080p movie mode.All in all, the Sony HX9V fills the bill. The still photo quality is not as good as the Canon (it has some smearing of fine detail), but it's far better than the Panasonic. I love the 1080p video and the 10 frame per second burst mode. The zoom range, including wide angle, is great. Handheld Night Shot works very nicely to give good shots in dim light. The LCD display is terrific. The GPS is nice, but I won't use it much, and it's not as fast or accurate as the Panasonic. The Sony has a ton of features that will take me a while to explore. Having to charge the battery in camera is silly, but I can live with it. I considered the new Canon SX230, but I'm not fond of the wide angle LCD, and from what I've read, the video quality isn't as good.For me, the Sony HX9V is a great all-in-one travel zoom camera that I can comfortably take anywhere and get good photos and great video. I'm very pleased.", "Date": "May 10, 2011"}, {"Title": "Fantastic-Could not be Happier!!", "Author": "LoveMyToys", "ReviewID": "ROTF1S9Z02R3G", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I originally bought the HX7V back in May (which I reviewed and updated).  I loved the HX7, but it was not without it's issues--most notably, over saturated pictures that had a strong red push to them and a tendency to oversaturate  reds in general (in other words, cranberry color looks like cherry).  The camera did not allow you to change the color or saturation levels.  I still loved that camera and was ok with photoshopping the color issues.  Unfortunately, the HX7v had the misfortune of meeting the pavement this weekend to my chagrin.  Needless to say, these compact cameras are NOT ruggedized! If not fall the accident, I would have happily kept the HX7.Since I needed a replacement camera I decided to give the Panasonic ZS10 a shot--since costco was giving a $70 instant rebate off their already discounted price.  While the colors looked better on the panny, the pictures looked awful--like someone smeared vasoline on the lens.  The video and pictures were soft, noisy and had a dearth of fine detail.  I am not a pro-photographer by any means, but these pictures looked poor.  I have had tiny canon elphs that took better pictures.  Even my wife (who is not picky at all) thought there was something wrong with the IQ.  I kept the zs10 for less than 24 hours.Finally, I headed over to BB and picked up the HX9 expecting to get the same photo quality as the HX7, with a few extras thrown in for good measure.  After shooting 200 pictures and a half hour of video--I am completely blown away.  This camera is worth the extra $60.00 over the HX7.  The IQ is superior right out of the box.  Using the iAuto feature, images are still oversaturated (although less so than with the HX7 since the HX9 has a brighter lens).  Sony has a thing with setting the IQ with high saturation and high contrast to give pictures a \"vivid\" effect as opposed to a natural look (they do this with their TV's too).  Fortunately, the HX9 allows you to customize the image and even gives you a \"Real\" color mode to get you most of the way there.  This alone makes the camera worth the extra money over the HX7V.  With some tweaking of the color and saturation levels ( which you can do in camera), the images look perfect.  Yes, you pixel peepers will find something to moan about if you are looking to crop and enlarge, but this is not suppose to be a DSLR.  You can see smearing and excessive processing if you look at the pictures at 100% on a high quality computer monitor.  That, for me at least, isn't a big deal.  I care about how the pictures look in print.  I printed out a 4x6, 5x8 and 8x10 images (the max my printer can handle) and they look fantastic. It's rare that I would print larger than an 8x10--so I am more than satisfied with the IQ to say the least.The video is equally stunning with gorgeous image quality at full 1080p at 60fps (this is unheard of in any low priced camcorder, let along a p&s;).  To be clear, this is true 60fps 1080p, not 30fps 1080p with interpolation that doubles the frames (which is a trick some manufacturers use).  This is evident in the 28mbps bitrate and, using software still capture software that allows me to click from frame to frame, it's quite obvious.  Coupled with Sony's excellent optical image stabilization (best in the industry) and high quality G series lens, the HX9V  better video than my $1200 Canon HG10 ( well, at least as good) in outdoor daytime lighting and in well lit rooms.  In moderately lit rooms the video quality is still quite good although the colors are a bit less saturated.  In low light, there is some noise, but the Canon was only slightly less noisy and the Sony performance in low light was impressive.  In all cases, the video quality on the HX9 was noticeably better than the HX7V (which is still very good in its own right).  I think this is attributable to the brighter lens on the HX9--f3.3 (HX9) versus f3.8 (HX7).  Sound quality is also better on the HX9 versus the HX7, but both were more than adequate for their purpose.  I think this can be attributed to the shift in location of the microphone condensers from the left side of the camera (hx7) to the middle (hx9).If you are serious about buying the best p&s; on the market that takes great stills (close, but not quite DSLR quality) and great video (truly impressive, leave your $1000 camcorder home quality) and has oodles of extra features, look no further.

The images are excellent, especially the automatic HDRI images taken inside with back lighting.  But what really blew me away is the 1080P60 performance.

I purchased this camera to replace my other carry-around super zoom Canon SX210 IS.  My wife typically uses the small camera.  She's ok with electronics, so this camera doesn't frighten her.  I don't ever need to shoot RAW with a small camera.  This is the first Sony camera that I've ever bought.  I actually had a harder time adjusting to it, but that's my fault for using only Canon for years.  The reason why I picked the Sony was initially: 1. The Canon SX210 takes too long to take a picture in low light.  My wife complained that it was slower than our Canon SD870, which the SX210 was replacing.  I tested it and agreed. 2. I wanted the Sony easy panoramic capabilities. 3. We booked an expensive trip to 6 countries at the end of the year, and I considered it worthwhile to replace a Canon that we weren't satisfied with. 4. I can sell the Canon to help pay for the minor upgrade to this cameraAll the reviews on Amazon which compare specs to other equivalent super zoom cameras are completely true about the typical cons of the HX9V.  For example:  Slow to zoom when viewing a picture.  Display is great but oversaturated, etc.  The typical pros for the camera are also expected:  Great picture quality, 24mm, great screen etc.I've used this camera somewhat intensely in the last month or 2.  I've taken 1000+ pictures.  I'm focusing this review on the extreme nit-picky things that I have found about the camera.Features that surprised me, and I ENJOY using (to a Canon-only user). 1. Burst mode.  My wife took an awesome set of burst pictures of me doing a Johnny Cage style jump kick in the Forbidden City in Beijing. 2. 1080p video quality is outstanding.  Beyond superior to the SX210, which looks like upsampled low res video.  I love my 5Dmk2 video, although it's hard to shoot in some conditions, but this HX9V has very superior output for a small camera.  I haven't tested much other small cameras, but I'm quite sure they probably can't beat the Sony quality.  I have shot in both AVC and MP4 formats that the camera supports.  More details of what I hate about the video mode later.  Lastly, the IS stabilization during videos works great, you can feel it working, and I absolutely enjoy it. 3. When taking videos, it will refocus after zooming.  Surprisingly enough, some small cameras just don't do this, and it is really annoying. 4. Auto mode works great.  I like shooting small P&S; cameras for the auto mode.  Yes, it's a great time to be lazy and simply get great pictures all the time.  This camera's auto features, including face detect, is vastly superior to Canon. 5. Auto backlight compensation.  Backlighting is the hardest lighting condition to shoot in.  The auto compensation for this is very amazing.  In the same lighting, it would require some technical work if I was carrying my 5Dmk2, but with the HX9V, I find myself always pleasantly surprised by how well it works.  I think this feature is so well implemented that I would recommend this camera to people just because of this feature. 6. Fireworks mode works very well.  I've taken some outstanding pictures that I can't do with an SLR.  There's some internal processing that the camera is doing to make the pictures look great, and I love it.  This mode works so well, that I will most likely never use a tripod to take fireworks photos when using this HX9V. 7. Built-in charger.  I think all cameras should build this feature in.  I never liked carrying a separate battery charger when travelling.  A charging cable is much smaller than a battery charger too. 8. Built-in camera manual.  This is very convenient, and the helper guides are good.  The index in the manual saved me a couple of times.  Then, it also didn't save me when I was looking for exposure lock 9. Low light pictures are better than the Canon SX210.  They also shoot faster than the Canon in low light.  As all the other reviews that I've read about the HX9V, the picture quality is basically what you see in the reviews.Things that completely irritate me, and make me subtract 1 stars from this review. 1. Panoramic mode ONLY works in 24mm.  It doesn't allow you to zoom prior to taking a panoramic picture.  This is not acceptable when you're in different shooting conditions.  I think Sony could fix this in a firmware update, but I'm not familiar if that'll ever happen. 2. HX9V doesn't have exposure lock!  This is a deal breaker for pro photographers.  Canon cameras always have AEL and AFL.  The custom button does exposure compensation, however, that isn't exposure lock. 3. Panoramic mode cannot lock exposure.  This makes the panoramic mode quite useless in MANY situations.  The whole panoramic is exposed to the edge frames.  So, for example, if you take a picture from the top of Coit Tower in SF, you probably would have a hard time getting a well exposed picture. 4. Video mode doesn't lock exposure.  That's a given since there's no such thing as exposure lock.  In many video shooting situations, I like having manual exposure lock and exposure compensation.  I think that's probably more a pro-feature than would typically be in a small camera. 5. Thumb grip is not sturdy enough.  If you slightly squeeze the thumbgrip, then you can see the LCD display change colors from the pressure/force that's transmitted to the LCD screen.  I would call this a slight mechnical design issue. 6. Video mode takes forever to turn on.  It truly feels like forever x2 when you're in the moment and you want to video NOW.  In some cases when I have my SLR and my wife is shooting a small camera, she takes 90% video, because I'll take photos and some video.  This really hurts how we like to use a small camera. 7. Sony proprietary charging cable is required for this camera.  It should've been a micro USB, but it isn't.  It completely defeats the purpose of building in the charger into the camera.  This cable can't be found in airports, or easily in other countries.  If I were to lose the cable when I'm travelling abroad, or to a small town, a replacement is definitely expensive, in addition to hard to find.  People who have forgotten to bring their phone charger or ipod charger to a trip know exactly the reason why all chargers should be standardized. 8. Panoramic mode default setting is the smallest size picture.  It was a shock to me when I thought the camera was only producing low res panoramic photos.  Finding the setting to change to the higher resolution will be hard for camera newbies to ever remember to do, or try out. 9. AVCHD file format is hard to use.  This is a general complaint.  I'm happy the camera has MP4, but I don't like sacrificing the ability to not have the highest quality.  The reason I complain about this is that I use Aperture on Mac to download and organize everything.  The videos won't be recognized and auto-downloaded.  I blame this problem on Apple and Sony.  iPhoto users, yes this affects you too.  On the bright side, I think that the default AVCHD format which can burned on Blu-ray is a good idea.  Too bad, I will never buy a Blu-ray writer.  MP4 is simply a much more useful format for websites, Mac and PCs. 10. Built-in manual is not intuitive to get to through the UI.  It was hard for a Canon-only shooter, who expected a large paper manual.  Sometimes reading the built-in manual feels like it isn't explaining things well.In summary, I would recommend this camera because it has the best set of features in it's class, in the market now, for the form factor.  I think the auto mode is top quality and any of my friends who tend to take bad pictures, will completely benefit.  As for myself, I'd replace this camera in 2-3 years (or even sooner), maybe with another Sony, if most of the critical gripes that I had above were fixed.", "Date": "September 20, 2011"}, {"Title": "Not perfect but, very very good overall", "Author": "Bob_S", "ReviewID": "RPIEW29TR4ZM5", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I have compared the Nikon s9100, Canon Sx230 and the Sony Hx9v.

I purchased it to travel light, because my dslr is a bit too big for traveling. For about a month I went back and forth between this camera, the Canon SX230 hs, Nikon S9100, Olympus SZ-30mr. My comparison conclusions:Pros: Fast zoom, awesome stabilization (quite stable at 16x, watchable at even 64x digital), great video (lots of format options, up to 1080p at 60fps), zoom and focus during video is quite good, 3 panorama modes (better results than Nikon), background defocus (no one else has it), widest angle (24mm), best screen (3\", 921k pixels), good battery life, good image quality (second only to Canon).Cons: Images (mostly bushes and grass) can look smeared at close inspection, you cannot delete pictures during instant review (you have to go back and view your pictures again before you can delete them), no miniature mode, GPS needs a couple minutes of clear sky view and turning it on/off is hidden under several menus, video record button is recessed and a bit hard to press.That being said, these cameras with big zoom are definitely meant to be outside cameras. Indoor pictures and portraits are not crystal clear and you would probably want to get a different camera for that.

There are a plethora of options for every conceivable situation, including, for example, portraits, snow pictures, fireworks, landscapes, night photography, etc. The camera can recognize faces and smiles and do the right things with them. Dynamic range is also superb. Backlit photos are handled well. All in all, the automation is great. The panorama shots are lovely.The still 3-D feature is a gimmick I could never get to work. I tried with increasing distances between subject and background, but the 3-D effect never showed up. I think Sony owes its customers an explanation for this disingenous bit of advertising. I lopped off one star for this.The panorama 3-D is OK but not a reason for buying this camera. In general, the 3-D effect is substantially less than you could get by taping two disposable cameras together and clicking the shutters simultaneously. BTW, you can enjoy the 3-D photos even if you don't have a 3-D TV or viewer. All you need to do is to convert them to old-style 3-D using free software. Then, you can view with red and blue glasses, either on your monitor or in print.In general, this camera is a great device for someone that does not want much control over their pictures, and is happy to let the computer inside make virtually all the decisions. 95% of the time you get well exposed, well focused, sharp pictures. But in a small set of situations where your judgment could render a better picture, the camera's automation gets in the way. I'm a great aficionado of shooting pictures by available light, with the onboard computer making virtually no decision other than focus (for which my eyes are too feeble). With my Sony Alpha 200, I can get wonderful pictures of this kind, with good hand support or a tripod. With this camera, not so good. The camera sees what it considers underexposed areas, and tries to make them brighter.Build quality appears excellent. Size and weight are good for a camera of its class. Zoom is sufficient at 16X (imagine, 16X zoom being considered merely sufficient these days!). Movie capture is top-notch.Bottom line: Good quality product. Buy it if you want to press the shutter and take a picture. Don't buy if you want manual control.Note: Sony has included the user guide on the CD-ROM and at their support web site. However there's no printed user guide other than a quick-start manual. For the kind of money they charge, they ought to have included a printed copy of the user guide.Update: I've taken about 400 pictures with this camera on a trip to NH. The pictures were exposed very nicely. Most everyone was a keeper. Just point and shoot! One caveat: The LCD shows the pictures with a much warmer tone than they actually have. Sony should release new firmware so that the LCD previews are exactly the same as what's captured.The bigger disappointment: The still 3-D feature. I've tried every trick in the book to get a still 3-d picture. I've scoured the Internet to see how others have taken still 3-D photos. Thus far, I have not seen one successful example of a still 3-D photo from this camera anywhere. I think Sony flat-out lied about this \"feature\".

Well now on to the review. As many other reviewers have noted, this camera is not perfect - yes, the pictures do look blurry at pixel level, the noise reduction is heavy handed, the battery takes a while to charge, the GPS is a bit slow, the flash is a bit overpowering at times and a point  I would like to note - the lens wobbles - yes, if you touch it while it is extended you will see that it has quite a bit of lateral play - don't worry it won't fall off :-). But even after all these common gripes, this is a pocket full of fun - for all you photographers out there - this camera can truly keep you entertained for months on end.This finally replaces my all time favorite P&S; - the Fuji F30 that has been traveling in my backpack nonstop for 5+ years. No, I am not disposing the F30 - I have not found a single P&S; to date that can best the low light performance and I am keeping it till the day it dies out on me.Back to the HX9V. I have only one advise for serious shooters - please do not shy away from using the scene modes and the iAuto and Superior Auto modes ... yes, it is fun to tweak the shutter speed / aperture / iso etc. in the manual and program modes. However, do remember that the best photos that you will get is when you allow the camera to do it's electronic magic on the picture processing - so while  manual modes make us happy to be in control, it is the auto modes that gets you the best shots!Before I finally zeroed down on the HX9V, I did consider both the Nikon S9100 and the Canon 230 - the Nikon lost out owing to the slightly inferior image stabilization and the Canon owing to the slightly narrower lens (28mm versus 24mm on the Sony). I am sure those two are great products as well, but to me the extended feature set of the Sony were just too compelling. And it does take very nice photos in every lighting condition that you can imagine. As you can imagine, daylight shots are a snap for this camera ... if you want to challenge it, try a low light landscape shot at 100 ISO on a tripod - the results will blow you away. Not carrying a tripod? Set it to Superior Auto and shoot hand held for a very nice result that will look great on a 8\" x 10\" print.And of course for everyone interested in shooting HD Video - this is just the best one out there now - period. It replaces my Flip UltraHD - that used to take great videos but the Sony with it's optical zoom, stereo sound AND optical image stabilization while shooting Video is just too good.Don't hesitate - this one is a winner!", "Date": "July 22, 2011"}, {"Title": "Love it!

It really came down to one thing. The best camera is one you have with you. I have taken over 1000 (yes 1000) pictures with my phone this past year or so. Having a young daughter I never miss a chance to document our family adventures. All my friends who have DSLRs never seem to have their bag (camera lenses etc.) with them at key moments. I decided on a point and shoot.My professional photographer friend said not to cheap out and look at $300 and above cameras. I originally was considering a Canon s100, but they were out of stock everywhere. I am so glad I found the Sony. This camera is the best \"all around\" performer of all the point and shoots cameras I looked at (and I looked at many). As with any item you can find detractors. Many of the people who rate this camera low are comparing it to larger DSLR cameras. You must know your needs. I needed quality photographs, great video and sound, along with being easily pocketed. This camera has it all. The panoramic mode is just amazing. I never thought I would get use out of it. The video is unbelievable for such a small package. It plays full HD on my 42\" TV. I just plug the HDMI cable from the camera into the TV and view the pictures and video. (The cord is optional and the amazon version is $7.95, well worth the few bucks). The video is absolutely flawless. The low light performance is amazing. I used the flash one time to test it out. Other than that I have not needed it at all. As far as speed, it is very fast. Some people have made negative comments on this and I have to question the settings they are using. I use the intelligent auto mode as my default setting. The camera takes continuous shots with no issues. Maybe these detractors need to get a class 10 card. I have been told that a slow SD card can slow down the processing after you take a photograph because it takes longer to write the data to the card. I recommend a class 10.My final choices included the Nikon 9100 and the Canon s100. The Nikon just had too many negative reviews (both on Amazon and other sites). The s100 had RAW, but lacked the zoom and video features of the Sony. I decided to go with the Sony. This camera has all the features I could ever need.

After a sweep of the internet and stumbling across a dpreview.com review, we decided to give this one a look. We needed something that could compose shots competently as well as take good video, especially with the travel we do and a baby on the way. Here's what we got:Out of the box, the HX9v comes across as a solid piece of hardware. It feels well built, but there's no way you'll mistake it for a slim, ultra-light point and shoot camera. It will, however, fit comfortably in any cargo pockets or loose fitting jeans. The dials and controls are standard fare; my only complaints being in the bad pop-up flash positioning and the small movie record button. We knew about both issues going in, so they weren't an overly rude surprise. I also have to admit being spoiled by my Samsung's touch screen onterface, but anybody who has used a camera in the last decade will be able to utilize the Sony.Firing it up for the first time, users are greeted by the standard OS request for date and time. After that was satisfied, power-up to shoot times were acceptably average in our opinion and certainly not like the horror stories we've heard from other reviews. If I had to sum up my main complaint in that department, it would fall under the header of 'graphical cludge'. Every display has a helpful graphic that ends up sucking away from you photo time. Fortunately, you can disable most of these prompts and I suggest doing so once you are familiar with the camera modes. It doesn't eliminate them all, but what's left is hardly worth mentioning and can normally be forced through by a half-depress of the shutter button.Picture quality was also a concern we had based on some of the more critical reviews we stumbled across. Fortunately there isn't too much to worry about if you're willing to invest a little time into your new camera.On the surface, the critics are right: The HX9v in Auto mode produces good, but somewhat soft and over-exposed pictures. And now the good news: it's almost all completely correctable since the camera has limited manual controls savable to three seperate profiles for your use. Is your picture too soft? Adjust the sharpen setting upward. Too much coloration? You can switch that too. Auto-focus a little too iffy for your taste? Set it to manual. After a few trips around the neighborhood experimenting with the various settings, worries have all but evaporated. To point, we took a picture of the moon last night. Most cameras would either produce a blurry mess or an over-exposed white blob without a tripod. With the HX9v, I was able to take a picture of the moon at full x16 zoom by hand in complete darkness and still get one of the best shots I've seen. The lens stabilization and AF are just that good. Try a hand supported shot in the dead of night with your DSLR and 300mm lens, or even that P&S; you have now and you'll see what I mean.1080p @60fps absolutely shines on the HX9v, but you already knew that.The x16 lens has rock solid stabilization and lightning quick focus, adjusting exposure and scene settings seamlessly on the fly. There are several videos floating around youtube and I promise you won't be disappointed if any sort of video production is in your future. With this package you also get an internal stereo mic that works as well as internal mics can. The video is so good that you almost need a professional package to fully utilize it, as opposed to something like Windows Movie Maker. On that note, windows media player doesn't seem to be able to cope so well with the codec and routinely exhibits stuttering on Q6600 4 core machine, but renders finished products just fine. Again, I assume its codec issues more than anything, but just FYI, there's nothing wrong with your camera.Sony doesn't give you a lot of bells and whistles beyond what's already obvious. Panorama shots are nice and can be put to creative use, while post processing filters can be added for more stylistic shots, like monochrome coloring. Smile detection is strong and can even be set to focus on kids or adults, whichever you choose. You can even take 3d photos for your 3d screen, if you happen to have one.Battery life isn't spectacular and video mode will eat it up (processing full HD at 60fps fully stabilized will do that), so you might want to consider an extra battery in your future. Some people have complained about \"ZOMG! in-camera charging!\" and I have to ask them where they've been for the last few years since half the manufactures of P&S; cameras routinely engage in this practice. One nitpic I have to make on the topic is that USB charging does seem iffy, like the camera can't seem to decide wether it wants to charge from your computer or not. Fortunately, you can just do it from the wall socket.Beyond that, there isn't much not to like here. It's a solid camera that isn't perfect, but offers you the options to work around most imperfections with semi-manual settings. The lens is great for a camera this size and while it won't replace your full frame DSLR, it offers you enough incentive think about not lugging it around regularly; especially with the x16 zoom and stabilization strong enough to use it. It all comes down to what you want. Pixel peepers will probably want to pass this one up for the Canon SX230 HS. If you need full manual controls or RAW, move along.

Loved the slim form factor of the TX1, but the photos could be very inconsistent in quality and the video shaky despite the optical stabilizer.  Looking for higher quality photos and video I have tried 3 cameras this summer. The Sony HX7V, Canon SX230, and the Sony HX9V. Liked the size of the HX7V and felt that the Canon took slightly better photos. But finally chose the HX9V because of its total package. The photos are good overall and the video is outstanding with a sharp picture, great sound, and silky smooth stabilization. I also really like the panorama feature and it has more than enough user adjustments available for my needs. The main complaint that I read online doing research is that some photos can look \"overly smoothed or smudged\" because of the aggressive noise reduction processing (which can't be turned off) and high JPEG compression. That's true at times, but the HX9V is also capable of taking very fine pictures and I feel that no \"Point and Shoot\" camera is perfect with photos and/or video. Each makes it's own compromises.The build quality feels very solid.  I'm not a fan of the pop up flash (also a problem with the Canon) but have learned to adjust to it.  With the rubber grip ridge on the front and thumb grip on the back I also find the Sony much easier to hold than the Canon which felt heavy and awkward to me (especially with the flash up). As I mentioned, the video is outstanding, by far the best of it's class, although I am frustrated that it takes several seconds to actually start recording after you push the button. But the video focus while zooming stays sharp and it does allow you to shoot photos at the same time it's recording, a great feature in situations like birthday parties (you can simultaneously shoot video AND photos of a person blowing out the cake candles).After spending countless hours online researching and reading reviews plus weeks of hands on experience with several cameras I really don't believe that there is a truly perfect Point and Shoot camera. But the HX9V seems to have the best balance of pluses and minuses and is a great choice for most people looking for a mega zoom that will fit in your (admittedly large) pocket.Pro's: Great features (especially the Panorama mode), Intelligent Auto Mode works well in most situations making it very easy to use, Fast focus system, Excellent video, Quality feel, Good photos overallCon's: Occasional \"over smoothing\" in photos, can \"blow out\" white clothes and backgrounds (like overcast skies) in Intelligent Auto mode, Lag in start of video recording, slightly bulky (compared to others in this class), higher cost than comparable Canon and Nikon", "Date": "August 8, 2011"}, {"Title": "Stunning", "Author": "A.

Before purchasing, I read many reviews, and the specs on paper sure look good. This camera is loaded with features. But as one professional reviewer said, something along the lines that this is a camera that does a lot of things, but does not do any of them exceptionally well. In hindsight, many of the 5-star user reviews are from people who just got the camera and are touting all the features, but had not used the camera for an extended period of time.My brother owned one of these months before I purchased. He took it with us on our family vacation to Colorado, and I loved the Panoramic mode. Other features that were a draw for me was the wide angle lens with 16X optical zoom, high-quality Sony G lens, all in a not too large of a form factor.I take mainly indoor photos of people. I used this for Thanksgiving and Christmas family gatherings, sporting events, and a few other indoor events, and was consistently disappointed with the results. The pictures were often too soft. Enlarge them on the computer and there is a lack of detail. Plus the colors are over-saturated, and many of the indoor shots had a yellow cast to them. And this was AFTER I took another reviewer's advice and put my HX9V on \"P\" mode and \"natural\" color. My brother and I both used our HX9V's at our family holiday gatherings. Both produced many disappointing shots, about 1 in 3 were blurry. This is unacceptable to me. Plus shot to shot times can be long with flash, about 7-8 seconds. I was so disappointed with this camera after the holidays that I sold it and bought a Canon. Canon point and shoot cameras have always had a more true-to-life photo quality in color reproduction and have been sharper than Sonys I have tried in the past. My brother is keeping his camera. He is a die-hard Sony guy. I'm not going to be married to a brand and overlook detrimental faults.Outdoors the camera does an excellent job. But what digital camera doesn't do well in bright sunlight? But a true test of a camera for me is how well it does indoors, and the HX9V failed me. So I've given up the sweeping panorama mode and 16x optical zoom, because more than these I need a point-and-shoot to also perform well indoors, and the HX9V is lacking in that department. Something for you to keep in mind if that is also your primary use for a P&S; camera.", "Date": "January 29, 2012"}, {"Title": "Great camera", "Author": "Salvatore Troiano", "ReviewID": "R2CRWD465NYXYU", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "A recent trip to China convinced me of the practical obsolescence of my point-and-shoot camera, which is over 6 years old. My wife researched the available offerings and spotted the favorable reviews of the SONY DSC-HX9V, which we purchased just before Christmas. Now that we've had it  few weeks, we're really happy we upgraded to the SONY. It has superb optical image stabilization -- existing light photos come put clear and crisp!Some reviewers objected to the delay when using the Superior Auto mode, but I found that the delay in processing when it takes multiple images and then pixel-by-pixel averages the results is minimal; generally no more than it took my previous P&S; camera to write images to its SD card. I find that the HD capability for both videos and stills is excellent. It performance so far in low light conditions is exemplary.I can't wait to continue to explore all the features and capabilities of this camera.The only difficulty is in finding out how to optimize the image transfer functions with my iMAC computer. So far, a combination of KODAK's Easyshare program, plus iMovie and iPhoto seem to work. I can edit the high-def images in Easyshare, and upload to my Kodak Gallery account with no problem.

It took amazing macro photos but was just about the slowest camera in the universe. I feel naked without a point and shoot in my purse at all times, so I went to costco to check out some of the models they had. They had a ton of Nikons on \"sale\" with rebates, and I was tempted to get one on the spot, but decided I'd better do a little research on Amazon first, and see what other reviewers had to say.Well, it was somewhat helpful but i was still torn between a Nikon that was about $260, or an Olympus, or a Sony. I took the research a step further and went to Best Buy to actually try out some of the cameras.  The guy in the Camera dept. was SUPER knowledgable about cameras, and totally bagged on Nikon. He said he wished Ashton Kutcher would stop being their spokesperson because he's sick of people coming in and asking him to give them a demonstration, when they're flimsy pieces of cr*p. He had me hold a nikon and note how it felt like cheap plastic, vs. the Olympus and Sony models. I had to say he was right. The other cameras felt more professional. Still, the Nikon I used seemed to have decent picture quality. I was so confused!I went to Costco thinking, well, at least they have a great return policy, I'm just going to pick one and hope for the best. Costco did have a few models I was able to hold in my hand, and luckily, this Sony was one of them. I liked how quickly the camera actually took the photo, after I pressed the shutter button. Now, it's true, after my LAST camera, just about anything would be an improvement, but I do think this one has got to be pretty quick.One of the things that impressed me the most is how easily I can photograph my cats - in particular, my black cats (I have 3). Usually, my black kitties don't photograph nearly as well as my orange cat, or my orange and white one (yes, i am the crazy cat lady). So I would take tons of pics of them, and didn't have nearly as many of the black ones. But this camera will probably change things. They looked great, thanks to this camera. I also do a lot of volunteer photography for cat rescue organizations, and took a bunch of photos yesterday. They turned out great. There was so much detail, and the colors came out very true to life. Sometimes the photo looked even brighter and nicer than the subjects actually were! I hate to admit it but I think it took even better photos than my canon rebel that I'm still paying off through best buy.I feel like i haven't even scratched the surface of what this camera can do. I really like the panoramic feature of this camera, as i do a lot of real estate photography as well, and am hoping to use this camera as a tax write off for my business. I do like the fact that there is a stereo recorder on the camera, vs. a mono recorder. I haven't even tried using the 3D feature of it... will probably let my stepkids figure that one out, as they have much more patience with electronic devices and can figure out how to use them in half the time as it takes me to figure things out.Cons: I wasn't crazy about the manual that came with the camera... it seemed really short. I am probably missing something, or maybe my eyesight is just going or I was too impatient at the moment to find what i was looking for (I was trying to look up how to find the macro settings). I will look again... maybe it was just me. Also, I wish it was easier to upload the videos from the camera to my computer. In my past, with my Olympus camera, I would plug it in w/it's cable and the videos would automatically download. This camera seemed to be working the same, only I realized, the videos didn't upload. I had to upload them separately. This may be because I hadn't yet uploaded the software, but I really don't like to have to do that. I like for things to be simple; at the very least i would like to be able to just cut and paste the videos, but they didn't seem to be in any format that my computer recognized... I am going to have to look into this further. Yes, I realize I should have looked this up ahead of time, but I really just needed a basic model to work with. There were so many cameras with so many features to look up, my head was getting full.Overall, this is a great camera and I would recommend it for sure.  You can see some of the pictures of my cats (and cats up for adoption that i photographed) in the photo uploads.", "Date": "November 7, 2011"}, {"Title": "Sony Very good camera, but also keeping the Lumix ZS7", "Author": "M. Dubis", "ReviewID": "RNKWA2SGXFME0", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I don't write reviews very often, but felt I should on this one because I spent so many hours looking for a good camera. I'll try to be brief and focus on key decision points.I bought this camera to replace my Lumix DMC ZS7 because it got \"camera fragments\" inside the lens (manufacturer problem) of the Lumix and Panasonic would not repair it under warranty even though it was less than a year old. Panasonic warranty's suck.So I said I wouldn't buy another Panasonic again even though that Lumix was an absolutely great camera.This Sony camera is excellent in the following ways:video - UNBELIEVABLE GREAT QUALITY  This alone could justify the price if you don't have a good digital video camera.  It eats a ton of drive space, though, so budget for a high GB card.zoom focus is greatpanoramic is idiot proof and takes really nice pictures.variety of options and ability to manually calibrate is great.Zoom is good in bright light.It fits the hand well.The things I don't likeI think the low light conditions are just okay, if not sometimes poor.  My Lumix rocked in this area so I miss that.Color quality is also touch and go.  It is often washed out to the point it's not worth the picture, especially things like flowers and such.  Again, my Lumix rocked here as well.Sunsets are so-so.  Intelligent auto on the Sony is not my choice, I use the customized settings to get the pic I want.Intelligent auto is not as intelligent as Lumix.  Again, my Lumix kicked butt here.Camera battery runs low quickly, so you need to budget for another battery in my opinion.  I do this with all my cameras over the years, so it's not really a big deal to me.The viewscreen captures hand smudges, etc, unlike anything I've ever seen. You really need to add a protection film.The automatic pop up flash at first was annoying, but I just turned it off and it doesn't pop up anymore.  I'm not sure if other reviewers who criticized that problem actually turned off flash or not.So now after about two weeks of using it, I am keeping this Sony.  It's a good camera and given all the bells and whistles, it has great potential.  Like I said, the video alone is so incredible I can't part with it any more now that I have been using it, while it's also so capablefor everyday use.That said, I also really miss my Lumix, so I ended up finding a repair shop who will do the work for $90.  The lumix excells in zoom, low light, sunsets, and color capture, so I simply want that back.  Prior to using the Sony video, I'd have said the the lumix video was fantastic, but now I say it's just good for it's purpose.  The Sony video is exponentially better.Yes, this may seem insane to keep both but I had already bought the Lumix a year ago and between the two cameras, I finally feel I've found the perfect tools to do the things I want to do for various situations.All the reviews I read really helped me, so I hope my review helps those who are still looking.", "Date": "August 5, 2011"}, {"Title": "For a compact you'll be hard pressed to find better..", "Author": "Tom Piccirilli", "ReviewID": "R2TI3X2UXVX014", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I have been a Canon fan for years up until now. Sony maybe changing that.  I really wanted to stick with Canon due to their reputation for outstanding still image quality. However, I never liked the way Canon implemented video on it's compacts, and missed having good video.This camera exceeded my expectations on the video section.  I playback videos on a 52\" Samsung LCD, and the detail is simply amazing. No it's not BD quality, but pretty darn close. Note: I am streaming video to my large LCD  via a Win 7 machine/ATI video card, using WMP player.  MPC-HC stand alone player will also support this format, which opens to door to a variety of video renderer's if you are one to tinker with image quality. I also find the stereo sound very acceptable. I leave the wind noise reduction option on.As for still images, I am satisfied but not impressed like the videos it takes. There are many features and options, some overlapping each other. Probably not the best camera if you are the type who doesn't want to make any adjustments.  If you are a photo tinker freak but don't want to lug around a full SLR, you'll be in heaven.Ok, about battery usage and charging. I do not like taking up camera time to recharge battery's. I found there are various 3rd party battery chargers you can buy for cheap.  I got a very inexpensive one here on Amazon that came with 2 extra batteries. Works perfect! I also found uploading images is much quicker by using a card reader vs uploading directly from camera using the supplied cable. So my work flow is removing both battery (recharge) and  memory card (upload images) after a photo shoot. Pretty simple and quick.  Also found an M Rock bag which is great for outdoors and has a belt clip that works with this camera.Here are some things I really like:1) Outstanding 1080P video2) Crisp still photos in good lighting conditions3) Powerful zoom lens for such a small camera, don't know how I did without it4) Variety of shooting modes, some very useful and fun to use5) Useful GPS function6) Ton of features, yet fits in my pocket for adventure outings.Here are some issues that could be improved perhaps with a firmware upgrade:1) There is no flash exposure adjustment. Some pictures come out over-exposed. Adjusting the exposure compensation does not help in flash mode.2) Noise reduction is too strong, causing minor smear in detail. Perhaps a menu option to select the amount of NR?3) The Jpeg compression is also way too strong, and unnecessarily  degrades image quality. I have my camera set at 16M, and all images come out at 4 Meg. Folks, we don't need to save on memory, since it is so cheap. Not asking for raw mode (which would be nice), but do what other cameras like Canon have done for years. Offer a menu with selectable compression option for those who prioritize detail over fast write speed.4) I love the superior auto mode, but the auto scene selection is not always consistent. I can shoot the same scene multiple times, yet the camera oftentimes changes the 'scene' mode. Perhaps a scene lock when using superior auto ?5) Additionally there is no manual over ride for white balance or focus when using many of the auto modes. If lighting conditions are not optimum, colors can be off, and/or out of focus without the ability to make corrections while still in auto mode. I like the concept of what Sony did, but would love to see some more user adjustments here.6) The HTML user manual is great for viewing on a tablet or PC, but need a hard copy to take with me in the field, where I can add notes, etc. The built-in user manual is nice perhaps for quick reference, but again, does not replace a hard copy version. Why not .pdf for those who wish to print the entire guide?I would not discourage someone from buying this camera due to the issues mentioned above. I am very picky and perhaps want a pocket camera to have the IQ of an SLR. It is still an excellent value. However if Sony makes some software adjustments perhaps for a future firmware upgrade, it will be that much sweeter of an investment.

The \"movie\" button is poorly placed and sometimes hard for even small fingers to find and depress, which means that you'll be doing a lot of scene trimming if you want to combine individual shots into a real movie (using computer movie-editing applications). 2. Wind noise can be a problem even with the wind suppression feature turned on. I'm going to experiment with placing a piece of foam over the microphones (on top of the camera). 3. With the pop-up flash located at the top left corner of the camera it's not easy for your left hand to find a comfortable resting place. Some people do okay holding a small camera like this one with just their right hand, but I'm not one of them. 4. The battery must be charged in the camera. If you want to avail yourself of an off-camera charger it's going to cost you extra bucks. 5. There is no real owners manual that you can look things up in--only a basic getting-started booklet is included. Instead, there's an interactive in-camera \"help\" type \"manual\" that you read on the LCD screen. So while the DSC-HX9V may be superbly equipped with amazing features, finding and understanding the details on how to use them can be extremely confusing, especially when you're in a tight spot and need to learn something right away. I can see that I'll be spending many hours of experimentation, learning how to use the intricacies of this wonderful little camera. 6. Lastly, the included DVD-ROM software is for Windows computers only. We Mac users are pretty much left on our own, which isn't such a bad thing, considering. You can still upload all your images, you just have to know a little more about your software. The main stumbling block for me was figuring out how to upload my 1080p 60fps \"AVCHD\" movie footage. What I learned is that when you open the folder that appears on your desktop when you connect the camera via the supplied USB cable, you can navigate to your video files in \"MTS\" format, but then you have to convert them to something useful. I purchased a third party app called Bigasoft iMovie Converter. If you do the same, just make sure you choose the high quality options for your output. I use the following: \"Profile: HD Quicktime Video (*.mov); Setting: Video Bitrate 18000, Frame Rate 60 [very important, see next paragraph]; Same Quality: True.\"All of the above said, the HX9V simply performs brilliantly. The images I have achieved even with very little practice are just plain amazing, and I will have to say at this point that the user and reviewer images I saw online while investigating this camera are poor examples. I don't know whether they suffered from the process of converting them for online use, or what their problem is, but my photos and movies are worlds better, and I'm no expert. Further, while this camera shines in terms of its ease of use and achieving consistently great still photos, where it really shines, as advertised, is in the movies it makes...with but one caveat, and this applies to all video cameras, especially small ones it seems...it's this: movies being what they are, you are going to be doing some horizontal panning, whether scanning the scene or following action, and what happens is that vertical surfaces and edges suffer from either a \"comb\" effect or \"stepping,\" or both. The comb effect is caused by interlacing, and this camera does give you a choice between interlaced or progressive, so if you're not careful with your settings you might be disappointed. The stepping or jumping effect comes from shooting in 30 fps (30 frame rate). So to achieve the same spectacular HD results that I'm enjoying you will have to be in the full HD mode at all times, which means progressive rather than interlaced, and the 60 frame rate, not 30. This desirable combination is designated as the \"PS\" shooting mode in this camera, and I highly recommend it. Get yourself a big SDHC card, preferably 32 GB Class 6. They're more expensive but they free you from worry about using up all your memory when in the most memory intensive movie mode. Also, you can get about 3500 full size, highest quality still images on a 32 GB card. (You'd probably wear yourself out long before shooting 3500 pictures! All that memory is for the great movies that you'll undoubtedly be filming.)All right, now for an actual case study: Recently I attended a girls' softball double header on a bright, sunny evening in a beautiful city park. Admittedly the circumstances were ideal, but the results I achieved were nothing short of spectacular when viewed later on a 1080p HDTV with an HDMI cable that I luckily had on hand. Really, we were just blown away! Because this camera, like other digital cameras, uses a softening algorithm to eliminate image noise, the picture quality understandably falls a trifle short of what you see in your local broadcast HD evening news, but that's in sharpness only, and you have to be a nit-picker to really notice it. In every other way the images appear \"professional,\" meaning that extremely expensive broadcast quality cameras are used by the big guys. That this tiny $350 device rivals them is just plain wonderful. And aside from the aforementioned occasional wind noise, the sound is amazing, too. Perfect volume, crisp, clear, realistic, as if the \"actors\" are right there with you in your living room dubbing the whole thing!I won't get into the HX9V's many features, because I haven't had the camera long enough to reliably discuss them. It would be a disservice for me to try to do so. Leave it simply be said that I'm extremely impressed with what I've experienced so far. The camera is solidly built, like a smooth little metallic brick, and in operation sounds and feels like a fine instrument. I'm very happy with it, but I'd give my left something-or-other for a decent printed manual! Shame on you, Sony, for not including one.

I'd have to say that my FZ-35 has a notch better image quality than this.  The main thing that knocks down the image quality on the HX9V is the heavy noise reduction that smears detail.  So long as you don't zoom too far in while reviewing your pictures on your computer screen, the photos will look very good.  The colors really pop (maybe a bit too much, especially red) and the image looks sharp and detailed.  But once you start zooming in (I'd say starting around 4x), you can really see that this is a consumer quality image.  The blotchy quality in the pictures is very noticeable at 8x magnification on the screen.  Bottom line is this... for casual use and for the vast majority of uses and prints, the image quality is very good... although not spectacular.The video quality is excellent quality, like everyone says... it's true.One tip for everyone out there if you plan on burning your AVCHD videos to a DVD for high definition playback on a blu-ray player.  I've tested all this out myself, so I know for certain what I'm saying is true.  If you want to watch your HD videos on your TV, and you only have a DVD burner, you'll have to use the 17 mbps 1920x1080 60i mode.  If you bump up the quality to 24 mbps 60i you will need a blu-ray burner and blu-ray disc to burn those videos.  An AVCHD DVD tops out at ~18 mbps so 24 mbps videos or higher will NOT play back from a DVD in a blu-ray player.  And as far as the 28 mbps @ 60p mode.... uhhhmmm it's awesome.... if you can play it on anything.  You CAN NOT burn the 60p video to DVD-Video or Blu-ray (blu-ray tops out at 1080p30/60i).  I have an iMac that a couple years old (2008) and it can't play back the 60p video without dropping frames all over the place.  So really, for me, 60p is kind of useless now because the only way I can view it is on the camera.  You can't even hook it up to your HDTV via HDMI and get the 60p... unless you have some kind of awesome super new TV I've never heard of.  Also, don't worry about the 24 mbps vs. 17 mbps quality difference... I DARE you to tell the difference without zooming in to the pixels and slo-mo'ing the video... and even then it's barely noticeable, if at all.  I'm a huge techno geek and I'm just shooting with the 17 mbps @ 60i and the HD looks awesome.  The advantage of being able to just drag and drop it to a DVD without having to re-encoding it is huge.Ok, I've really rambled on here.

I bought this camera about 3 days ago, and I will say that it has met my expectations regarding picture clarity.  I am not a avid photographer, I am an average person, who takes pictures to document memories, things I think are cool, etc.  I was looking for a camera that would be better than average, but I am not by any means a DSLR person.  It's too much camera for me.  That being said, the HX9 is definitely full of features, some more than I will use, but it is nice to have more options.  Pictures have come out clear, and maybe the people talking about poor picture quality come from a more professional eye.I will also say that if you are an impatient person, this is NOT the camera for you.  There is definitely a little lag time between shots, but you can make up for that by the \"burst shot\" feature, where it will take up to 10 shots in succession.  This is a REALLY cool feature, especially because I like to take pictures of our dogs playing ball, and jumping up in the air.

(some people don't like this, but just think, you don't have to worry about lugging your charger around when you travel)  It also charges via your computer by USB.CONS:-No dedicated macro button-USB is awkwardly placed-Not a fast camera, takes a bit of time to \"record\" pictures, and ready itself for the next shot.  Uploading kind of slow, and zoom a little slow.-Not good in medium light, flash always wants to pop up if on auto, even when I think it's pretty darn light inside.  My old Canon was superb in indoor conditions-Movie button too small and not in a great place-and again, that's slow to start recording. You might want to start ahead of the action just to make sure you don't miss the beginning of your subject matter.So in summary, I would recommend to a friend.

We have several cameras in our household, ranging from cell phone cameras up to a entry-level DSLR.  This camera has a fantastic feature-set (best available at the time).  It is a good size.  It has a great zoom range.  It's advanced photo modes like handheld twilight are very useful and hard to find from other manufacturers.  And, it takes outstanding videos.  I have no doubt that I made the right decision with this camera purchase.  Yet, I find myself dissapointed every time I use it.  The camera has several annoying quirks like a proprietary cable, but the big letdown for me is inaccurate color reproduction.  In it's automatic and scene modes, the colors that this camera produces are overly saturated to the point where they almost look cartoonish.  I compared this camera to every other digital camera my family owns (2 iPhones, 2 other P&S; cameras, 1 DSLR) by taking the same photo in the same lighting conditions from the same distance. While the Sony HX9V held it's own and came out ahead in several other attributes, I preferred the color reproduction on every other camera (the iPhone 4S is a little wild with the colors too).  To be fair, I was able to acheive much better colors with the HX9V by using the camera's P and M modes, but then you lose out on a lot of the cool features that make this camera such a great choice to begin with.  Also, to be perfectly clear, it is not that the colors produced are not pleasant, it's just that they don't look real to me.  It's as though the designers chose to make the photos \"pop\", rather than look real.  I imagine that color reproduction is a relatively subjective science and that personal preferences will vary on this (many may not even notice).  Everyone has different things that they are sensitive to in their photos.  For me, it's color reproduction and in the case of this camera, it's a deal-breaker.Best Features:-Pictures are very sharp and clear-Video picture quality and sound quality are both outstanding (we rarely use our dedicated video camera anymore)-Great zoom range for a camera this size-Many, Many features including GPS tagging-Ultra fast shooting allows many cool and useful modes like \"Handheld Twilight\"-Panarama mode is very easy to use and turns out nice shots-Build quality is solid-Good low-light performanceDrawbacks:-Inaccurate color reproduction-Proprietary cable-Dowloading photos to Mac computers using iPhoto is not as straighforward as other camera brands-The battery charges in-camera, so if you want to charge an extra battery you will also need to buy a separate battery chargerSummary:This is a well-featured camera that shoots great videos and sharp, clear photos.

I recently purchased it and even after only having it for a few days I am amazed at all it can do.  While it is first and foremost a point and shot style camera, it is very much so a fully capable camera and  has many features normally reserved for the more professional DSLR style cameras, and at a fraction of the cost (~$300 vs. ~$1,000).  I had read review after review after review on this camera before making my decision to purchase it and read virtually NOTHING but good things about it and it had been deemed a step above many of it's competitors (which in such a competitive market, is a large feat).  About the only downside I can see with this camera is that if you're not very photo-savy or technologically informed, it could seem like it almost has TOO many options/features and can seem a bit complex and intimidating for the less informed.  But, to ease certain people's sensation of panic, I will also add that it has a couple automatic settings in which the camera (very intelligently I might add) automatically detects the current conditions and adjusts the settings accordingly.I could go into all the intricate details as to what makes this camera as amazing as it is, but there are plenty of reviews out there about this model that already cover that, so I personally will only touch on a couple of the key features that make it stand out above the crowd.  One exciting new feature is the background defocus setting which, as you guessed it, makes the background of the image you're taking appear softly out of focus(with adjustable levels of blur for you to choose from).  This is a very \"artistic\" effect that you normally only get from DSLR cameras, which adds a level of depth and pleasant imagery for your pictures.  The DSC-HX9V also features a number of various settings for all kinds of shooting situations.  There's one specifically for shooting pictures of food, one for pets, one for low light visibility while being handheld, another for low light with use of a tripod, one for shooting fireworks, one for beaches, one for snow, etc.  Another really amazing feature of the camera is the Superior Auto (aka Intelligent Auto +) setting that, when used, can take up to 6 pictures rapidly in succession, and combines the best quality images of them to create one superior looking picture (used predominately for low light images with a brighter foreground, or situations where there is a very bright background).  Yet another exclusive feature is a burst mode, where the camera is capable of taking a one second \"burst\" of shots at 10FPS so you can capture fast moving or action shots more easily.  Again, this is technically still a Point and shoot camera, so you can't continuously take burst shots like a DSLR (after the one second burst of 10 pictues, it takes approximately 7-8 seconds for the camera to \"process\" the images and save them to your memory card before it's ready for the next shot), but it's still a very nice feature that a lot of cameras don't normally have.Overall, I would definitely recommend this camera to anyone who's looking either for a superior point-and-shoot camera, or someone who's looking into starting to get into photography (more so as a hobby than a profession) and doesn't want to spend $1,000+ on a camera that takes serious photos.", "Date": "December 3, 2011"}, {"Title": "WOW", "Author": "Robert L.

For the previous five years or so I have used the Cannon SD700IS, which i initially loved, but over time I became increasingly frustrated with its limited optical zoom, anti-shake and low-light sensor systems.  On two different occasions i called Cannon to ask if a new point-and-shoot existed that would give me better results; the answer was always no.  Then a friend told me about the Sony Cyber-shot DSC-HX9V.  i bought it, and tried it and all i can say is WOW.The 16X optical zoom is amazing since it produces pictures that are as good or better than the ones i got before with a 4X zoom.  This obviously attests to the quality of the anti-shake in the Sony.  Lastly, the low-light sensor gives me pictures that are far beyond my expectation.  i did not give this camera a 5 star rating because it is heavier (193 grams) than i would have liked it to be.

I still believe it is a good camera, but it's not for me. Two things bothered me about the camera: many of the modes worked by digitally combining images, which could lead to some really interesting result - but without a clue on what to change if you don't like what you get. Lack of manual settings and information from the camera bothered me. Secondly, in many modes the camera is very slow - processing images, responding to button presses. Although the shape and layout of the camera are great, the actual operation is a little frustrating. I now have a Canon SX230, which is not perfect, but better for my needs.Original review:This is a good camera for someone looking for one of the most versatile devices around. This camera offers long focal length, lots of tech features, great video, and strong low light performance. This is a camera for all ocassions; and as a jack of all trades, it's master of none. It's good at many things, but if you are interested in one particular feature, there's probably a better alternative.That said, the Sony (and close competitors, like the Nikon 9100 or the Canon SX230) is very convenient. Fits in your pocket, 24-384mm, HD video, and, finally, OK low light shooting.The Sony stands out from the aforementioned competitors mostly because of its feature set. It has some smart options: the panorama mode is brilliant, the video good enough to replace a camcorder, and some clever tricks that use the bracketing and fast shooting, like handheld nightshot (high iso bracketing to reduce noise) or background defocus (combining in- and out of focus images for a shallow depth of field effect). Lots of things to play with, and much of it accessible enough to make sure you actually will.Although I think the Sony is the best compact superzoom around now, the Canon SX230 and Nikon 9100 are also very good. The Canon has excellent image quality and full manual controls, but less features, a very annoying flash, and terrible battery life. The Nikon has great auto performance, but video is not great and there are no manual controls. Since these cameras are all about compromise, it's a good idea to look at these three top contenders and see what's good for you.For the Sony, here's the main pros and consLPROS* Great features* Excellent video (enough to replace a camcorder)* Nice build and design* Useful focal range, with strong macro and image stabilization to let you use it all* Quick Autofocus at all focal lengths* Good low light performance - good up to ISO 800. (Of course, no match for an SLR)* Good battery life (for me, a decider compared to the Canon)* Good screen* Extra programmable button. Every camera should have this.CONS:* Slow in many situations - like switching modes, or bracketed shooting modes. Some video modes take 4-5 seconds to start.* No shutter/ aperture priority mode (there is a manual mode with access to both, though the camera actually has no variable aperture, but a N/D filter)* Some ergonomics issues - buttons that lag a little or are hard to press, awkward button assignments.* no flash power setting - awkward, because the flash overexposes!* Battery charges in-camera. An external charger can be bought separately.* Connects to computer through proprietary USB cable* Aggressive noise reduction and compression - Canon has significantly better image quality.

Powerful flash4. Smart face detection5. In camera guideCons:1. Colors were washed out in auto mode w/ default settings in a few pictures (ex. sky which should have been blue was white in a simple scenery picture including the sky, green mountains and small lakes, these were taken from an open air ski lift but there was no snow in the picture to make it a challenge).2. Camera refused to focus on close by flowers if I went beyond 5x optical zoom. Physically the flowers were still couple of feet away, not sure if the 'macro' limit clicks in with optical zoom. None of Multi-point, single point, centre focus options worked. I have owned many Casio Exilim's in the past and never had this particular problem.3. Panorama mode is not as easy as with the Casio EX-ZR100. It gives you a fixed buffer that you have to fill in (instead of making a full panoramic picture based on when you stop) and is very sensitive to how smoothly you move the camera.4. Fireworks scene mode is very artificial - you would get better pictures without it and you don't have to wait for the in-camera processing to complete before you can take the next shot.5. Focus in low light situations was slow and not optimal6. Very awkward flash location - I keep feeling that the mechanism will break because I ineveitably keep my finger there which presses against the flash as it pops up. It will take a while to retrain myself and hold the camera differently. Canon SX230 and Nikon S9100 have the same problem as well.7. External (faster) charger is extra on top of the already high price.8. Buttons are poorly designed - movie button is too flush with the body, power and custom buttons are identical making them hard to differentiate during the night.9. ~Even though the camera body is the same size as comparable Canon SX230, Nikon S9100, Casio EX-ZR100, it's 10% heavier and looks a bit bulkier too.Check out dcresource.com, pcmag.com and cnet.com for professional reviews of compact superzooms.

Great camera.  I had previously purchased a Nikon S4100 compact digital camera.  It was a good camera with one exception; the picture quality was very poor.  After six months or so the lens stopped moving in and out and I returned it on my optional warranty and was given a refund.  I hope that the camera was just defective from the start, but at any rate I was very disappointed with it.  Before deciding on a replacement I spent a good bit of time doing the research, checking reviews, ratings, etc. of cameras and finally decided on the Sony DSC-HX9V.  I have owned other Sony cameras in the past and have been very pleased with them.  After the Nikon disappointment I was a little nervous about how the new DSC-HX9V would perform.  Again, WOW.The HX9V is a very nice looking camera that you can put in your pocket or hang on your belt in a small case. The picture quality is excellent.  In low light the quality is a little reduced but still very good.  The movie quality is also excellent.  The menus are very easy to understand.  There are tons of options so it does take a bit of time to familiarize yourself with everything if you wish to utilize the many options available.  For most photos you can simply set the camera to one of the auto programs, on the program dial, and shoot great pictures.  You have the option of going full manual or using one of 3 auto programs.  4 if you count the \"EASY\" option.  The Auto programs give you varying degrees of options in the menus that you can, if you wish, tweak the auto settings with.  I am not a professional photographer, but so far it seems to have everything I could want and more. On the program dial there 10 options including Intelligent Auto,  Superior Auto, Program Auto (my favorite), Manual Exposure Shooting, Memory Recall Mode, iSweep Panorama, Movie Mode, 3D Shooting, Scene Selection, and Background Defocus.  Each of these programs has various options available by pressing the Menu Button.  The Zoom is amazing and the pictures taken with full zoom (optical & digital is about 68 power) are actually stabilized and quite decent.  I cannot begin to describe all of the features that are available; actually I will probably never need to use most of them. If you wish to know more, there are numerous reviews available online. Check out the movies on YouTube that show the HX9V zooming in on the moon.  Chuckle.The bottom line is that if you want a camera that you can just set to auto and take great photos and great movies, you will love this camera.  If on the other hand you want a camera that you can tweak to your hearts content, then again you will love this camera.  I know that I couldn't be more pleased.

The camera feels solid and is constructed of quality materials including a rubberized hand grip and a metal body. Although the camera is thicker than most point and shoots, it still is compact enough to fit nicely in my front jean pocket. I snapped some shots and printed a few of them to check the quality of the raw unedited images. First of all, I was blown away with the quality of the zoom lens. The camera has a gyro sensor built into the lens to stabilize images when shooting and works great when zoomed in at maximum to deliver clear and detailed shots. The full HD movie recording is remarkable, with crystal clear sound and picture. However, I do notice a fish-eye effect when recording video.  The i-sweep panorama mode is easy to use, but the stitching of photos is often hit or miss.  The camera does struggle with low light settings and often times delivers dark, grainy, or blurry images. These problems are to some extent improved with the cameras \"superior intelligent auto\" feature which takes multiple shots and merges them together to produce a single image. I can't comment on the camera's 3-D features since I do not own a 3-D television. However, the in camera 3-D feature mimics a 3-D display and is neat to show off to friends. Although many reviews have mentioned the inconvenient location of the popup flash, I couldn't imagine any other location for the flash since the face of the camera is primarily devoted to the powerful zoom lens. The popup lens is located on the side of the camera where you would normally place your left index finger when shooting. The lens is engineered to pop up automatically when the flash is required, but can be pushed back down manually when the flash is no longer needed. The built-in GPS receiver for geotagging images is great but does drain battery power. I have purchased an inexpensive Sony battery as a spare for when I have the GPS receiver on. The camera is also packed with a few other nice touches. When viewing a group of images (such as burst shots taken at up to 10 frames per second), the images can be advanced forward and reverse just by tilting the camera left and right. The click wheel located to the right of the display is pretty slick, and allows you to advance through stored images quickly just by rotating the wheel. When viewing images on the display, panning and zooming is smooth and the click wheel allows you to pan images left and right.

I actually purchased both because on paper, there was no definitive winner.  After playing around with the Sony and the Nikon for only 10 minutes, the Nikon went back in the box and was returned.So what was the defining factor?  Image Stabilization.  The Sony system is phenomenal.  I ran a test at full zoom and attempted to capture video.  With the Nikon, there was a heavy amount of jitter and jumping, regardless of the stabilization features.  The video was basically unwatchable.  The Sony in contrast did a very good job of stabilizing the image and providing a smooth picture, even at full zoom.  A good 25% of the time I am using my camera on the ski slopes attempting to take video of my 5 year old daughter, and a good stable zoom is essential to capturing good content.

The camera does an excellent job of figuring out what the shooting conditions are (low light, fast action, portrait, twilight, backlight, etc.) and chooses the appropriate mode.  This really does make shooting pretty brainless if you're not interested in playing around with manual settings.Menu system is easy to navigate, and includes real-time guides in case you forget what you're looking at.Fantastic video quality and image stabilization.  This camera can sub for a full camcorder in just about any situation.CONS:Slightly slow startup time.The battery cover feels a bit precarious and sticks out from the base of the camera--careful not to catch it on something and rip it off!The menus are a little tricky to navigate, with the scroll wheel so close to the select button.

Most importantly, I have an obsession with capturing pics of interesting cloud formations.Pros:- Sharp pictures of clouds/sunsets/landscapes at wide aperture settings.- 16x zoom in a pocketable size!  Yesterday we went hiking and I had this camera in its tiny pouch.  I did not even notice I had it on me.  When I saw some eagles, I was able to take some decent pictures thanks to the 16x zoom.  The pictures were not as sharp as the FZ100's but the hx9v is not as heavy/big as the fz100 either.- Almost never have to use flash!  Indoors, with just a fluorescent lamp, I can get decent shots with none of those yellow blotches that many cameras including the FZ100 are known for.  This is a big plus for me.  I am experimenting with the Manual mode and with ISO at around 800 with flash enabled, you can take very crisp and detailed pictures of people indoors with very little light.  The downside is that flash charging will make you wait. Also, flash tends to over-expose everything in the immediate 5 ft and underexpose everything beyond that upto about 9 ft.- Battery life is excellent and holds charge for a long time.  I don't care about the GPS feature and have turned it off.  That helps save battery life as well.- Excellent low-light Auto focus locking.

With its 16x zoom you can get real close on the action as well.Cons:- Slow, slow, Slow in almost every operation except auto-focusing.  I'm used to the Rebel XT's almost instantaneous startup times.  The FZ100 is very quick to startup as well.  Time from pressing the start button to getting the fist pic on the XT is about 2 secs and on the fz100, around 3 secs.  but on this camera, first off, the button is very hard to press right the first time.  And then I counted almost 5 seconds before it took the first shot.  My kid usually has already run away before I can take a picture in this camera.- Very very slow when recording movie.  Its almost as though the camera is confused what to do.  You depress the movie Record, then count to 2, then you'll see a 'Standby' message.  And you're like \"huh?\" and then after that, it'll start the timer and you'll know it started recording. And when you're done recording, you depress the button again, and after a couple of seconds, it'll finish.  So, if you intend to get the entire recording what you intended to capture in the first place, stop a couple of seconds after when you ideally wanted to stop because the camera gobbles up the last couple of seconds as well.  But hey, its 1080p!!( I must add that if the camera's mode dial is switched to the movie mode, it starts and stops much faster than if it were in one of the other positions)- 'Processing'  If you're planning on using the Superior+ auto mode, then get ready to stare at the 'Processing' on the screen.  And after its done, it'll display the picture taken (BTW, there is no way to turn off the auto-review) and then release the shutter button to take the next picture.  My advice, use the regular auto mode in daylight conditions because the difference between that and superior auto is very little when there's ample light.  Under bad lighting conditions or special cases, use the superior auto.  Also, to get rid of the auto review, click the shutter button half-way before it even shows the picture and the camera will get ready to shoot again.-pictures become soft when zoomed in.  Focal range is 3.3-5.9 so pictures become softer when zoomed in. Zoomed in pics of critters shows all the features but things like fur hairs, grass, leaves become fuzzy instead of distinct.", "Date": "March 11, 2012"}, {"Title": "Camera is good, PC interface problematical, Mac is great", "Author": "Thomas L.

With decades of experience and a huge investment in pro photo equipment I'm not exactly a newbie. I find this camera to be remarkable in its class. Of course it can't compete optically with bodies and lenses costing 10X as much as this complete outfit, but for a pocketable item it knocks the socks off of even the best cell phone cameras. That is exactly why I bought it.There are lots of features and functions I have not yet tried, but one thing I can complain about is the awkward interface to my PC. It seems that images and video stored on the memory card are in a file format that cannot be simply transferred to the PC by removing the card from the camera and inserting it into a card reader on the PC. To get your work into your PC requires installation of SONY's proprietary PMB software that is supplied on a CD with the camera. You would think that once PMB is installed that should be the end of the matter right? Wrong! Next you have to get PMB to recognize your camera - and the connection must be made in a very specific sequence of starting the software, turning on the camera, and then attaching the USB cable. Do it the wrong way and PMB won't see your camera although it will bring up other photo/video folders you may have on your hard drive(s).Another frustration is AUTORUN on my PC. As soon as I plug in the camera, other photo/video applications (in my case that is Windows Live Movie Maker and Canon's special software) pop up immediately and they must all be closed or PMB will not run. Unfortunately the PMB warning to shut down those other applications will not let you X them off unless you first X off the PMB warning screen. Once you do that you have to start all over by shutting off the camera and unplugging the USB cable etc. Frustrating to say the least. Once you have crossed all the t's and dotted all the i's in the correct sequence, PMB does recognize the camera and you can import video into your PC - in a low resolution preview mode. Next, PMB must convert it to HD as you originally intended. That process can take as long as the real time video takes to run. Apparently the remarkable shooting speed in the camera is thanks to some clever compression algorithms that must be decompressed before viewing later.Apparently PMB software is strictly for the PC. It cannot be installed on the Mac, nor is it needed. iPhoto on the Mac immediately recognizes photos, displays and downloads them if you wish. For video I use Roxio's Toast 11 Titanium. Grabs video directly off the camera and allows you to edit if you wish and burn directly to CD/DVD/Blu Ray, or whatever you have.", "Date": "February 24, 2012"}, {"Title": "Simply Perfect", "Author": "J.

I have a kid on the way, and so I really wanted a camera that can take incredible baby pictures and then, later on, capture a moving toddler.  After thorough research, my sights were set on the Sony Cybershot DSC HX9V, which had garnered impressive reviews from several leading websites and many positive customers reviews.  I went to Best Buy to feel it out, and didn't really expect it to be there since it had practically sold out everywhere online during the Christmas season and I was planning to backorder it anyway.  Well, lo and behold, there was a returned camera waiting at the store.  Turns out somebody had bought the camera, stolen the cord and AC adaptor, and returned it saying that Sony had \"forgotten to include it in the box.\"  Haha, what a laugh!  The Best Buy associate was totally pissed, because here was a perfect camera missing the proprietary accessories, returned practically untouched.  So anyway, I picked it up and immediately I knew that this device was something entirely different than what I was accustomed to, and simultaneously thrilling to hold and snap photos with.  The zoom lens promptly caught my interest.  I was able to zoom in on a boxed stereo about 200m across the store, take a picture, and then when I zoomed into the photo I could clearly read the font that was no more than 1 inch in height.  Talk about an eagle-eyed zoom lens! Each photo I snapped in that lifeless box store was amazing and vibrant.  I took pictures of employees, zooming into their zitty pores, rows of overpriced Chinese electrionic bric-a-brac, a pigeon who had somehow flown into the store and patiently waited in the rafters for someone to drop some crumbs from their granola bar.  Eventually, I said thanks and departed the store, and immediately ordered this camera from Crutchfield.  Even though it was on backorder, it came in less than a week.  Ever since, I have taken the most incredibly awesome photos of everything- my glowing, pregnant wife (she loves the \"soft skin\" setting), my cats, my neighborhood, the zoo, etc.  Almost every picture I have taken is magazine-quality in my opinion.  Low light shots are ridiculously good compared with my old Canon P&S.;  Movement shots, such as my cats jumping off the kitchen counter with their feet coated in bernaise sauce, are incredible, as well.  The panoramic function is spellbinding.  I haven't used the 3D mode yet because I don't know anyone with a 3D television, but I'm curious as to what the future might hold in that regard.  Video is so clear, I think I could literally film an HD reality television show.  Steadycam technology has come a long way.  Even bounding around the house was smooth, like the opening credits of HBO's \"Tales From the Crypt\" (I just needed a good Danny Elfman score).  This camera is packed with features and I could spend about an hour discussing all the ones I've tried, but I've only tried about half of the settings available on this divine contraption.  Can't wait to take it on vacations.  In conclusion, this is the best camera I have ever used in my life, better quality than many affordable DLSRs you will find on the market, and capable of taking the sharpest pictures imaginable with 16.2 mexapixels.  The menus and functions are easy to navigate, it's reactivity is exquisite, it's functionality is unmatched by other point and shoots, and it takes triumphant pictures of felines, rambunctious five year-olds, and active preggo wives.

I've been looking for a nice new camera to replace my 5, or 6 year old 8mp Sony Cybershot. While it served me well and still works great, I've been wanting a new camera that is able to take high definition video. What I loved most about my old camera was how fast I could snap pictures. While it had a tendency to sometimes produce out of focus pictures when I took rapid shots, I often was able to take two, or three shots before most others got off one and at least one picture, usually more, came out nice and sharp.The HX9V is equally impressive at taking quick snap shots on full auto. I'm not a professional by any stretch of the imagination, but because I like to attend Renaissance Faires, I end up taking thousands of pictures every year. Most of the time, I need to take them quickly, with little prep time. I've found little problem with the start up to ready time of this camera, or how quickly I can take pictures in rapid succession. It's a fast camera!As I mentioned earlier, I wanted a camera that was able to take good high definition video. I originally considered purchasing a larger camera type, like the Sony HX100v (or the Nikon P500), or even a DSLR camera, like the Cannon Rebel T3i. The problem I had, was that I really didn't want something that big. When I attend Ren. Faires, I do so in full period garb. I am very conscious of what I'm wearing and try hard not to let anything non-period show. Large DSLR cameras, and even the HX100v are very hard to hide, while wearing my outfits. The HX9v is the perfect solution! It's small enough to fit in a pouch, yet powerful enough to produce excellent quality pictures and video.I've already taken hundreds of pictures and dozens of videos since getting it and I've rarely been disappointed! Under good lighting conditions, this camera can produce awesome pictures! Night shots, or low light images aren't always the best, and produce some noise, but I never expected perfection from such a small camera and most of the time, the pictures look great, even in less then perfect lighting. The video quality and stabilization abilities of this camera are also top notch! Finally, I've had a lot fun, and some success, exploring the camera's HDR, Panoramic and background defocus settings. I still have some learning to do before I master these, but they are great little extras that I will use quite often in the future. I don't have a 3D TV, so I can't really comment on how well the 3D features work. It's nice to know that they are there though, if I should ever get a 3D TV.If you are looking for a small, point and shoot camera that produces excellent pictures, overall, and even better video, I doubt you'll be disappointed with this camera!

Rogers \"BoPeep75\"", "ReviewID": "R3DI7ISCXM7PQ5", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Normally I wait a little while before posting a review, but thought I'd share what I know so far and then update later.First, I am not a professional photographer by any means (oddly enough I used to do manual settings and know much more than I do now but guess I've forgotten over years of not doing it).My last camera was a Kodak, which unlike many people, I never had a problem with really except for bad overexposure whenever I used the flash.  That was one thing I HATED as I take a lot of pictures indoors with my little girl.  It was one of the main reasons I went looking for a new camera.  That and my other one was getting on a bit - five years old.  In technology, that's about fifty years translated.)I'd read a lot of reviews on this and other cameras, and quite honestly, didn't care if I had high-def video recording.  We don't even have a high-def TV but I figured it might be nice in the future, and I wanted the longer range of magnification plus the higher resolution.  There are also a lot of reviews boasting about the great shooting in low light, and they are NOT wrong.  This camera does perfectly indoors.  I even read a review of a man who took it to a museum or historical site (sorry, can't remember exactly now) where no flash was allowed.  He said it did very well, and I tried this myself.  I was shocked at how well it did.  It wasn't as crystal clear as if it had more light, but it was clear and far, far better than my last camera could have hoped to be.Another reason I needed to update was simply that my old camera could only hold a 2G memory card.  I wanted to be able to hold more pictures and was very limited by always having to switch out cards.  I don't know what the limit is on this but I know I have a 16G card and I've seen others buy it with a 32G.  I'm sure a lot of that is because high-def recording takes up a lot of room, but I mostly take pictures and it should hold a ton in that space.As for the battery life, I can't speak too much on that yet but I only did a partial charge on it so far, and it is still shooting after a couple days.  I did buy an external charger and two extra batteries just because I want extra if I'm out somewhere for a heavy day of shooting.  I believe it said in the book that it would take about four and a half hours for a full charge, so you definitely want to consider that, whether you get what I bought or at least another battery you can charge in the camera one after the other.The color is a bit intense, but I like that.  I do know there's a setting some people prefer for more natural color as well.  The back screen is plenty large enough, and the size feels just right in my hand.  The only con (and this is very slight) that I can speak of right now, is the fact that I'm used to the camera's button being on the right side edge (of the top), whereas here it's to the left of the dial (which is on the right edge).  Until I get used to it, I find myself losing a second or two trying to get a shot.  Not a big deal, but in little kid time, a second or two may mean losing a shot completely.  Otherwise, I don't have any other new camera to compare it to but I know it turns on way faster than my old camera, and I have nothing but high praise for the burst mode.  That feature is awesome!  For sports, kids, or whatever, it does remarkably well.  I know it has a faster burst mode time than many other models I looked at.I haven't mastered the panorama mode but to be fair, I've not gone through the instructional DVD yet.  I've read through the book, but it's not very detailed.  My panorama shots aren't crystal clear but I'm sure that's user error at this point.  They're still pretty good.All in all, I'm very, very pleased with this purchase and hope to post an update after another month or two.Edited:10/8/11Just a few notes as I've been using this a few more weeks and wanted to add some things.First, I have mostly (but not completely) gotten used to where the capture button is and the flash (which pops up in an odd place as other reviewers mention).  What is more difficult to get used to is the way there's a dial AND a power button (I'm used to turning the dial to the mode and it automatically coming on).  That seems to be something I can't get over and confuses my husband whenever he gets hold of it.  Also, it is very confusing to me to say that something is \"recording\" when it's really saving the file of the recording you just made.  In bright light, you can somewhat see the screen but not great, so it's hard for me to see if the REC icon is flashing.  I thought I was recording something today but apparently I'd hit the button twice, then saw the \"recording\"-see saving - and I didn't get the video at all.I will say that I'm incredibly pleased with the quality of the video.  I didn't expect to enjoy it this much but it's really quite stunning, exactly lifelike if you ask me.  The time it takes to write the burst mode of photos is a bit long, yes, but I'm still so impressed by the speed of the burst that I consider it a tradeoff.  Also, still in love with the low light capability.  I read some people aren't that impressed but I can't help but be.  I took a picture of my little girl sleeping in a dark room with a nightlight.  I'm not saying it was the best photo ever but it was clear and you could see the details of her face.  Awesome.The way the files are named is weird, yes.  I liked my old camera better in that regard.  Many others have commented on this, I know.  Maybe it's me, but I can't really wrap my head around the instructions on the CD and therefore, don't know a lot of what it can do or how to take a good panoramic shot yet.  Hopefully my next update will say I've solved this.  The last thing I will say is that I never minded the color saturation, especially since I knew there was a way to do more \"natural\" color.  I haven't figured it out though yet, once again due to inability to follow some of the instructions.  I change the color contrast/brightness, but it's still not what I would call natural.  Normally, not a big deal as I like good color but sometimes, you just don't need it.  I took some pictures of flowers my husband gave me.  Gorgeous.  Even more gorgeous than they were in real life.  The colors weren't even the same.  When I toned it down, the colors became drab, not natural.  Still, I enjoy this camera a lot.  I will post more later after another attempt with the instructions.", "Date": "September 16, 2011"}, {"Title": "Has a small quirk with zoomout, otherwise, nearly perfect!", "Author": "T. C.

And it performs perfectly; I couldn't be happier with every facet and function of the camera. As for those that complain about having to charge the battery in the camera, so what's the big deal?! The battery easily lasts a full day so just plug it in when you turn the lights out and you're good to go the next day.

Here are a few additional comments that the perspective buyer of this product may want to quickly review, and perhaps may lend some credence in your purchase decision.  Today's newest Smart Phones are approaching, or have even surpassed, the capabilities of what a lower-end P&S; Camera does - or has done.  Today's higher-end P&S; Cameras are approaching what a lower-end DSLR Camera does, or has done!  However, even the most recent sophisticated Smart Phones do not have the true capabilities of a \"good\" P&S; Camera, just as a good P&S; Camera does not have the true capabilities of a DSLR or SLT Camera.  Certain limited overlapping capabilities of the most recent Smart Phones, vs. P&S; Cameras, vs. DSLR/SLT Cameras have created conditions and trends which have the Camera Manufacturers in a real quandary regarding which direction to take, at what price, degree of technical capability, and most importantly - what does the Consumer really want?  Hence a big reason why Nikon and Sony have brought out Camera products that are only slightly larger in physical size than a traditional P&S;, yet offer \"removable Lenses\" (ie:) Sony's NEX 3,5,7, hence further approaching, but NOT equal to, DSLR/SLT capability.  These newer NEX type products also carry hefty pricing at this time.Enter the Sony DSC-HX9V P&S; (which started selling in the second quarter of 2011).  With so-many P&S; type products to chose from, this Sony offering was initially \"just another face in the crowd\", and buyers had NO REAL reason to select this product.  Ah, but by the latter part of 2011, people started taking note that this particular product is a true kick-butt, slightly different Point & Shoot.  Therefore without listing all the TECHNO features that are already posted on many other Amazon reviews, this review is more of an editorial to potentially help the reader.I will state however, that this product offers very high: Sensor Mega-Pixels (16.2MP), Optical (16x) Zooming, Multiple Focusing Modes, 10FPS Shot Burst speed, Excellent Color Rendering for both Stills and Movie, has hardened 3\" Gorilla Glass LCD with its own high pixel count, High Dynamic Ranging (ability to take photos in low light without a Flash), easy to use display for selection of Features, plus a built-in User's Guide, a GPS that works well when selected, Sony's Exmore Sensor (same used in some DSLR's), Sony's \"G\" Series Lens, and a \"host\" of other offerings.  That is a lot of stuff for a Point & Shoot Camera which are normally only found on DSLR Camera products.The only negatives I've found are: With the LCD and GPS left on at length, it will however consume Battery Power quickly - carry an extra charged Battery with you, or leave the GPS setting off, or only use it sparingly.  The \"User's Manual\" is 30pgs. long and doesn't say a whole lot.  The on-line printed \"User's Guide\" is some 220pgs. long, provides in-depth usage instruction, but is only in HTML Format vs. PDF, can be difficult to follow & print out.  There are programs for HTML to PDF conversion, but Sony should simply offer PDF format.My own photography primarily consists of Landscapes and Wildlife in which I utilize several DSLR/SLT type products made by Sony, Canon, and Nikon.  I also utilize a number of higher-end Point & Shoot Cameras for carry-around for those days or times when I'm otherwise not planning a day of photography.  I am not a professional, only an amatuer who has an in-depth interest in Cameras and Photography.  The bottom line: This is a great Sony product if you want to have a P&S; that approaches entry-level DSLR capabilities, great Color Rendering, or just leave everything in its Auto-i, or Auto+ Modes.Hope this review and insight helps others in their selection process.", "Date": "January 29, 2012"}, {"Title": "All-around best choice", "Author": "W.

In short, it gives the best video quality you will get from anything. At 1920/1080/60 fps, it easily rivals sophisticated HD camcorders and may even exceed a lot of high-end DSLRs (depending how you see it, no auto-focus on a DSLR video simply puts me off, not to mention the poor aliasing rife in DSLR videos).Image quality wise, it is acceptable, just the sort you would expect from point-and-shooters (never expect the 16m pixels to be the same as the 16m on the t2i). Nothing to be excited about nor dread about. But the sweep panorama blows away all the negatives. Just imagine being able to do 180 degree panorama by just panning you cam, and generating a 10,000x4,000 image (that's 40 megapixels) with ease. That's something even a DSLR will struggle with a fish eye lens (yes I have a 8mm fish eye on a canon t2i by the way). On HX9V, at least you don't have to defish afterward, and don't have to put up with the weight (DSLR plus a fish eye lens could easily weigh more than 5 times this thing.And finally, being able to go from 24mm to 384 mm in under 3 seconds. Actually you could even achieve 480mm if you opt for 10M image size and activate smart zoom, which essentially does the cropping for you, which gives you basically 20x optical zoom). I don't have anything more to ask for, since 24mm is wide enough and 480mm long enough for 95% of my need. The rest 5% is covered by panorama.For your info, I also use a canon t2i and have to carried three lens in such a setup in order to cover the same zoom range of the HX9V. That will be: 18-55mm, 55-250mm, and an 8mm fish eye.Just think about the difference of weight and likelihood of keeping the set up at all times!

Sony relies more on the guide built into the camera, which isn't all that good.  If you want more, you can go online and read more directions.  Even then, getting something done with the Menu system might not be possible.  Following their online directions did not lead me to where I wanted to go.  Why not just print a step-by-step manual?

With all the camping/hiking I do the extra wide is very noticeable and worth it. Also for indoor and large group shots it's also needed. Then the zoom up to a 384mm is great. Honestly anything over 300 is silly without a tripod. Still the image stabilization (IS) is good enough that if there is something far out there you want you can. Think cathedral roof paintings, zoos, deer in field. So although not necessary it's great to have the extra reach. Then add the low light into the mix and you finally get a camera that pulls away from all the other PAS. Still the biggest most important draw is both the intelligent auto and superior auto settings. Everyone has some sort of intelligent auto and honestly Sony's isn't the best in my opinion. However the superior auto is a neat addition not generally replicated and in combination with the other features really rounds out the camera. The software in this camera that takes a large amount of the skill involved in other cameras and boils and adjusts everything. I never waste my time with the various scene settings. And that's what I want in a PAS, to turn on, compose, snap, turn off. NOT to mess around with any functions. Ok except when I do... if this is your only camera, and you know a bit about photography you will inevitably come across some shots that both auto modes don't capture to your liking. In those few instances the manual mode gives you some control but not usually enough to satisfy someone willing and able to use those settings. Still I haven't found an attached lens camera that did offer me what I wanted.As your sole video camera. First upgrade to a class 10 sd card, nothing slower or video stinks. Honestly I'm a little behind the times here. I used to use a Sony HDR-HC9 MiniDV HD. I also had one of the predecessors. At the time it was one of the first 1080p and the slow speed replay was great. But I just didn't like the laborious video editing/tape transfers. I know that's a thing of the past but I still don't take two objects when they do mostly the same thing. Any camcorder needs at least 60p (never i) in the quality your shooting, IS, and a stereo mic. The 16x optical zoom on this camera, the stereo mic, the IS, and 60p frames/second mean I'm able to capture video that looks great on my 42in led. Also I take this more places so it's available more. I'm thinking of getting a Hero 3 for my Jeep/Mt Biking but right now this does 75% of what I want for those applications. As a final note remember p not i which is to say progressive interlacing. My opinion is that video should never be shot at i ever. The wavy artifacts make me motion sick whenever someone pans. If your cam only has 1080 60i or 720 60p shoot in 720. Again the concept of quality here with this camera. Lots of PASs have video, heck my phone has video. But none of them have the IS, 16x Zoom, 1080 60p, and low light that this does. That's what makes this a keeper. And at a hundred dollars less than the lowest cost camcorder sony currently offers (in 1080 60p of course) this is a great bargain to include full camera capabilities with real life capable video.As your dslr backup this also rocks. It weighs the same as your kit lens and covers a huge range, so instead of worrying that you didn't bring XX lens just whip this out and get a shot (still not usually THE shot but often close enough). Also as an exploring lens you can take a lot of photos not worry about notes, and get the image data from your \"test\" shots. This can help you figure out what lenses and flashes to bring back to an area and you can time the daylight to work out more in your favor on the return trip too. Then there is the great panorama software. The size and quality of the panoramas are just great. I could get better with a tripod, a tilt shift lens, and a shit load of time, but I'm not even tempted with this great application. Horizontal, Vertical, left or right (up or down) lets you fine tune the exposure (exposure is set on the initial image) and as long as you move slow enough the stitching is fantastic. Finally there is the awesome video capability. Even if you have every conceivable lens and flash for your dslr it will not be set up for video at the same time. This has you covered for impromptu video. Also there are just times you have your biggy in your pack but don't want to seem too intrusive or \"professional\" this lets you keep your expensive stuff in your pack. Oh almost forgot for some of us the in camera HDR of the HX9V is also a nice function. It's quick, easy and can give you a quick idea of what your dslr will get you in post-processing (my dslr body is a little older and doesn't do this in cam).Notes to Sony: Ditch the Background Defocus, phone apps and free software do better and don't take 5 seconds to tell me it couldn't figure out how to do it with a shot. I understand why the flash is there but I still don't like it. I like a more positive two (or three) points of contact on the camera for better stability. Finally I know there's a megapixel war out there but 16mp is too big for such a small sensor, I always have it set to the 10mp size. Love what you're doing with the RX line (bring on the PASs sensor size war!). I hope a 4/3s or 1\" sensors become common on all PASs. If you made an exact spec HX9V with a 4/3 sensor I'd scream like a girl for a week. If you can pack 1080 60p stereo video and between 28-100mm lens on an APS or Full Frame sensor with respectable speed (F2.8 for APS or F4 for Full Frame) in something remotely pocketable you'd have oodles of dslr users banging down your doors for a true dslr backup. Hell I'd have a custom hip holster made for it so I could be the first navy seal of photography.

That sony was only a 12.1 megapixel camera with a 5x optic zoom... compared to this 16.2 megapixels and 16x optical zoom... but that camera was amazing for when it came out, and it lasted a long time for me. I used it all the time, took it everywhere I went. In fact, I used it so much, put it to work so often, and dropped it more than it should have been, that it was starting to have a few technical issues. The hatch door where the battery goes wouldn't stay closed, the zoom wouldn't always work, there were scratches on the lens that caused flares in the photos... so it was time to upgrade.for the price of this camera... I'm surprised how nice it is. this camera could go up against much more expensive models.The 16x optical zoom is amazing. I was able to get beautiful shots of the recent Venus transit (June 2012) using this camera and a Shade 10 welders glass. it picks up on the colors much better than the previous camera. The images also seem sharper and more lifelike.the 3D image capability, to some, seems useless as you can only see them in 3D on a 3D display unit (like a 3D television) but those people who think that would be wrong. yes you can only see the image in 3D on a 3D viewer... however, even without a viewer, the images have more dimension, more depth, than an average photo. it just seems to pop off the page.there are a lot of other settings on this camera that my other camera didn't have. My favorite is a soft skin portrait setting. if you take a photo of a person, it almost looks photo-shopped. The soft skin image gives the person you're photographing a soft glow, blemishes seem to be invisible, the face looks smooth and soft, and the eyes appear brighter and more colorful. I am able to capture better action shots using this camera. I was able to get a butterfly in flight, and get perfect photos of the wings when they were spread open, mid air. Knowing how fast a butterfly moves, that is not an easy feat. So I like how fast this camera works.the panorama option is another nice upgrade from my last cyber-shot. to be able to take a full photo of the sun setting behind the bluffs where I live... it makes for a beautiful almost painting like photo. this camera takes just as good of photos as my bother's $1000 camera.For the price, you can't beat this camera. Easy to use, Sharp images, fun settings to play with, and a trusted name. I will always buy Sony cameras. I had great luck with my previous camera, I am having great luck with this camera as well.Battery life on this camera is about average. it's no better or worse than any other camera I've owned. I really like the view screen. nice size, crisp and clear image. I can't say enough good things about this camera. I'm extremely happy with my purchase.If I had to nitpick, I would say the ONLY complaint I have is that, in some settings, it seems like it takes a long time for it to reset so you can take another photo. My brother was taking a picture of me feeding a deer, One photo was quick, but then he had to hit the photo button 8 times before it finally took the photo. I am not sure what setting he had it on... but he said in that setting it should take so long to reset. (he's a photographer so I suppose he would know.)other than that, even he said this is an amazing camera, and for the price, it really could go head to head with much more expensive models.

It offered everything I wanted... excellent image quality, 1080i HD video, sweep panorama, etc.  So I ordered it.  I've had it one day, so this isn't going to be much of an in-depth evaluation, but I'm VERY pleased with the camera.

Wow what a great camera!  I'll post a few early shots taken with it in the photo section.  So far, I love it.

Better in some--the autofocus is instantaneous so I can use intelligent auto setting and take fine pix from a moving car. The intelligent auto PLUS feature is better than using backlight settings.The low light performance is about equal to the Nikon (both are impressive). The Sony is 24 mm with 16x optical zoom and has fine stabilization (I use 64x a lot). It's got 3D and panorama and stereo mikes. The Sony goes a little out of focus during video zooming but it's not too bad and it is far better than the completely objectionable Nikon.  The video quality is very nice.  the sound recording is nothing to brag about.The remarkable LCD on the Nikon is finer and brighter than the Sony, but the Sony is satisfactory.the Sony doesn't have the poorly-located popup flash. The Sony's flash is FAR too bright--you'd better be at least 20 feet from your subject or it washes out! They should have a 2-step flash and it would be great.The color indoors is bad.  You have to white-balance.  This can be a pain in a lot of circumstances where you'd best re-balance repeatedly.  I'm really surprised Sony let the camera loose with such poor colors.  Since I do most of my photography outdoors or in Temples and caves it's not a problem but it isn't the best at the kids' party!I took over 10,000 pix with the Nikon on a 4-week trip to India a year ago. It seemed reasonably durable. I took 17,320 pix with the Sony on a 4-week trip to Nepal and India a month ago so I know it's plenty sturdy. Probably 6,000 pix were from a moving car and they are quite good, fast enough not to have much blur in the foreground.The cheap batteries you get from Amazon are great in either camera. I bought 2 pair with charger for each of the cameras and in 4 weeks per trip with a zillion pix they proved to be fine--last longer than the Nikon or Sony batteries, actually.Get a pistol grip for $10 from Amazon to screw into the tripod socket.

I previously had a Canon Rebel XSi and it was overkill.

I'm no camera nut.  I can't get into the specifics of all the technical details.  I just know that I'm very happy with the results.  Photo's taken with the camera almost always look good.  Video's are awesome.

The panorama mode seems to work well, though panorama photos seem mostly a gimmick to me.  I have no need/desire to use the 3D features.  As a point and click it works great.My only complaint is the burst mode and time between regular photos.  I miss with the Rebel XSi the ability to hold the button and take back-to-back photo's.  The DSC-HX9V does this, but at a maximum of 10 photos and the quality could be better.  It does offer a cool \"playback\" mode of these burst photos where you can tilt the camera back and forth and it will scroll through the photo's, similar to an animated GIF.  Also, the time it takes between taking a photo and the camera being ready to take a second photo sometimes seems too long.  You take a photo, it pops up the review and then takes a couple of seconds to get back to the point where you can take another picture.  Maybe there is some way to adjust this time, but if so I haven't found it in the manual or within the settings yet.Overall I'm very happy with the camera.

Panasonic one was having touch screen and 60 sec shutter  exposure and 240 fps recording options advantages over the others. However from the reviews I concluded not to go for touch as one has to operate buttons also along with it and I was not sure about this brand in digital camera category. I went to the nearby store and checked Nikon  s9100 and Sony HX9V and found that optical image stabilization was way better in HX9V than S9100 and later was not having very good reviews in amazon and other Indian websites.

Half a year ago, my old Panasonic camera fell to the ground once again and it still worked, but I thought it was time I should get a new one.  And what I most wanted was that it must have large optical zooms, wide angle lens, and a plus would be if my hand shakes it could still take a nice picture.  One day I was in Costco warehouse and played all the point-and-shoot cameras side-by-side.  I tested them by taking picture of a package box far away.  I compared Nikon, Canon, Olympus, Panasonic and a Sony HX-7V.  The Sony's picture was most impressive.  Although when I zoomed to the 16x optical, the package box in the LCD view was so shaking that I was afraid that I could take a good picture, after I pushed the button, the picture was so sharp as if there was no shaking.  When playing back, I could zoom in the picture and the small characters on that box was so clear that I could read them without problem.  All the other cameras could not do that.  So I decided I would buy a Sony.  When HX-9V was on sale last October, I immediately bought it since it has 1080p video that the HX-7V doesn't have.  Now I have owned this camera for almost 4 months.  Many friends have recently bought DSLR but I am not moved because I want no more than this camera can do.  Sure the DSLR's picture quality is better, but this camera is good enough for me.  Although it is not as compact and light as some model, it provides me more powerful functions than they do.  Since it is the best point-and-shoot that I have owned so far, and it already helped me record a lot of unforgettable moments of my family in videos and pictures, it deserves my compliment.Pros:  - 16.2 mega pixels:  Good enough  - 16x Optical Zoom:  So that I can shoot an object far away  - 24mm wide angle lens:  So I can take a picture of a crowd of people without problem.  - 1080p video (1920x1080 at 60fps) with stereo microphone:  What I can say is the video quality is just stunning.  Playing the video on my HDTV is just like watching an HD channel.  Now my Panasonic camcorder will sleep in my drawer forever.  - image stabilization: Also amazing, I can take a crisp picture of a moving object without need to worry if I hold the camera stably enough, or the object is moving too faster, as long as I can catch it I can take a nice picture.  - Panorama mode:  I can sweep a lot of things in one wide picture.  - battery life:  I have no complaint yet.  After a full charge, the battery can hold power for several weeks without problem.  - GPS locator and 3D: I haven't used those feature yet, but they are not bad to have.Cons:  - The time between pressing the shutter and completing writing the picture to the SD card may take several seconds which seems to be a little long, but the progress bar shows me that the camera first captures the picture and processes the data which takes about 1 second and writing data takes about 5 seconds when I take pictures indoors.  When taking pictures outdoors, it is much faster.  I don't know if that is the camera performance or the card performance.  - The flash's position is awkward.  It is on the top left where I normally put my left index finger with my thumb on the left bottom to hold the camera.  But I have got used to it by moving my left index finger to the left side.Regarding shooting the pictures indoors or under dim lighting conditions, using the flash in Super Intelligent Auto mode I can take sharp pictures without problem.Conclusion:With all the good stuff it has, I am pretty happy with my purchase because I know I cannot get a product that can meet all my expectations.  I haven't found a second camera that have all the features that I care, so I give it a 5 star without hesitation.Finally, some suggestions for others:  If you haven't decided which one to buy, write down a priority list: What features are must-have, what features are a plus, and what features are not bad to have?  Keep your budget in your mind, and then go to one warehouse or or two, compare all the cameras available there, write down your feelings for each model you tested, you may then have some idea on which one to buy.  If budget is met, get it.  Otherwise, if time permits, wait for several months till it's on sale, just like me.  Don't trust those numbers in the specification, the actual feeling can be totally different.  For example, I compared three different brand cameras that all have 16x optical zoom, but they are not the same, or even similar.  Only trust your feeling.  You don't want to spend a couple of hundreds of bucks to get something with fancy specifications but when you use it you're not happy.", "Date": "February 2, 2012"}, {"Title": "Great pictures, but terrible product quality and bad pop-up flash design", "Author": "D. C Smith", "ReviewID": "R3BIMTO2CWDDR1", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "The only reason I am back here writing a review after owning this camera for almost 2 years is that I'm looking at how to trade it in on Amazon.  While the picture quality IS great, the actual camera quality is not, and the ergonomics of the pop-up flash are awful.First the anti-reflective coating on the LCD screen started scratching off almost immediately after we started using the camera.  After 1 year it was almost 1/2 gone and made looking at pics on the LCD very unpleasant.  At that point I just wished all the anti-whatever coating would just disappear, and I got my wish about 6 months later when every last remnant of the coating was gone.  We don't use the camera THAT much either.  And while we do not keep it in a protective case this is the first camera I've owned that has suffered so much as a result.  Frankly, this camera is a bit of a porker too so I didn't want to add extra bulk by carrying it around in a case.Second, after about 18 months most of the buttons are starting to feel like they are loosing their quality.  It's hard to describe, but it's almost as if the button are starting to \"creak\" when I push them.  It was not like this in the beginning, and again no camera I have owned before (including other Sonys) have done this.Third, I have noticed a couple of times now the automatic lens cover gets stuck about half way and I have to poke it with my finger to retract all the way.  This camera has never been dropped or contaminated with anything other than the ambient air conditions, so I am really disappointed overall with all these quality problems, which is a big surprise coming from Sony.Finally, the pop-up flash could not be in a worse position.  Every person who has ever used this camera, whether it's other people in our family or strangers helping us take a picture, have put their finger directly over the flash and been surprised when it tries to pop-up and either a) they just keep their finger there and the flash goes back down and hence the picture turns out poorly, or b) they wind up holding the camera in a different, less comfortable way that also makes the picture come out not-so-great because of the camera angle.  Huge design flaw in my opinion.  I'm guessing Sony was trying to solve the low light problem by creating a huge flash that would not fit anywhere else or could not be embedded permanently in the front face of the camera like so many other brands.So while I love the zoom lens, HD video quality, low-light picture quality, and panoramic sweep, I am ready to trade it in and will probably go back to Canon.  Also, all the other features like 3D are just fluff, I can't image anyone actually using that.  3D is kinda dead anyway.  And I have never been able to figure out the difference between \"intelligent\" auto and \"superior\" auto.  I can't tell you how often we are constantly changing the mode setting, there is no ONE good setting.  You will eventually get a great photo, but it's all trial and error with the modes.  And I am more patient with technology than most people.Good luck!", "Date": "September 13, 2013"}, {"Title": "Great camera for the price", "Author": "NLWM", "ReviewID": "R1IU3ODVPJVEZF", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I bought this camera last year and it has proven itself to be perfect for me.

Although I've had some fairly good compacts in the past, including the Fujifilm F30, none of them really ticked all the boxes and delivered across the wide range of circumstances most family shooters encounter, let alone pushing the boundaries of the art.  Sony began rewriting that book with the Sony HX5V, which I happily used as my compact camera through the summer of 2010, but with the arrival of the HX9V I'm truly surprised how far Sony has come...  This really is all the camera a family shooter needs.Moms and dads alike drag around bulky and cumbersome DSLRs to get sports photos of their kids, but wouldn't you rather have a camera that fits in your pocket and rivals the zoom range of the largest DSLR lenses?  Sure--most parents would. And as more discover cameras like the HX9V, they will.  The image quality is plenty good.I compared 13x19 prints from the HX9V vs my Sony NEX5: outdoors, in good light, the HX9V performed quite well against the NEX, with both myself and friends who I pressed into service viewing the prints sometimes preferring the HX9Vs prints! The HX9Vs metering was a little better, and the punchy but not over the top colors edged out the NEX in some scenes. I also had prints from my iPhone 4, which lagged noticeably behind both of those cameras.  In a dimly lit church, the NEX print was much more detailed.  The HX9V's image-stacking modes work very well, bringing quality noticeably above past compacts, but they don't quite work miracles. That said, I used the HX9V very successfully at an evening concert, producing a very nice 8x10 taken with the anti-motion blur image stacking mode at ISO 3200.  In practice, it satisfied me, if not delivering the ultimate quality of a larger sensored camera.That being said, my NEX couldn't have come close to that quality, as I was in the back of the venue.  The HX9V's ~380mm zoom (which can be usefully extended much further with \"clear image zoom\" for smaller print sizes) has a reach you won't believe until you put it in practice. I used this reach frequently for sports photography, and in good light the quality level is quite astonishing. Add the capability of shooting 10 frames per second, and tracking autofocus that I found would reliably track my fast moving dogs (unlike my pricey Canon 5D Mark II), and you have a truly viable family sports shooter. Is the quality the same as a DSLR?  If you're pixel-peeping, no.  But unless you print larger than 13x19, I don't think you will notice.As an all-around family shooter or travel camera the HX9V really comes into its own. Autofocus is simply superb: fast, accurate, and fanatstic with people (face detection really works).  This camera WILL keep up with unpredictable toddlers, given enough light. Anyone who has shot a toddler knows they're faster than racehorses. No joke.  If used for travel, you will be thrilled with the crisp, colorful, detailed shots from this camera, especially at wide angle, where the Sony G lens really shines. At the longer end of the zoom contrast and sharpness decreases somewhat, but it is still quite an impressive lens that will surprise you. Many DSLR kit lenses aren't this good on the wide end.Another impressive feature for travel photography is the high resolution panorama mode.  Using this mode, you can take extremely detailed 43 megapixel panoramic images that you could print MUCH larger than a shot taken with most cameras.  I was frankly quite astonished at how good this shooting mode was, when it stitched well. As with any panorama, you will be challenged if you include the sun in the frame, close buildings or straight lines, lots of people, etc. but Sony's implementation is better than most (even dealing with people fairly well).  Try a few of these on your next vacation--you will be impressed at the little details the 43 megapixel image reveals upon arriving home. Certainly yiu will see things the naked eye could not hope to capture without binoculars.Negatives?  Certainly there are some. Even though Sony's image-stacking HHT and AMB modes help the small sensor cope in dim light, they will not deliver DSLR-quality results. Whether this is a deal-breaker is up to your real-world usage and skill at maximizing the camera's potential. Also, even though the background defocused mode is interesting, and sometimes produces good results, I found it very unreliable and generally frustrating. It will not reliably replicate shallow DoF like a DSLR. If you like this effect, you would be much better served by the newer Sony RX100, or a DSLR. I would also like to see Sony allow control over noise reduction: it is heavy handed, and produces some \"odd\" digital looking results when pixel peeping. You won't notice this in a 13x19 print made from a photo in good light unless your nose is up against the print--so whether this truly bugs you is down to your intended usage. the biggest negative for me as a photography enthusiast is this and almost all small-sensored cameras don't allow me the control of DoF that I like.  But I admit, I'm really not the target user, and when I use this camera as a target user would it really does deliver in spades.In closing, don't let the pixel-peeping review sites put you off: this is a seriously good camera for real-world users.  When my non-camera-geek friends ask me what camera to buy, this is always at the top of my recommended list for them; unless they're willing to commit to carrying a substantially larger camera, this little pocket wonder really covers all the bases a family is looking to cover...  And in a pocketable form factor!

This review will be mostly about videoing. I specifically go to a lot of concerts, both at large and small venues and I videotape frequently. Ive been looking forever for a a point and shoot camera (that will be allowed into the larger venues, can fit into my purse) that has good video quality as well as audio quality for loud concerts where I am frequently next to the speakers. Plus I wanted one that would zoom a reasonable distance without distorting the picture. This camera meets all those needs plus more.It also actually takes (really great!) photos WHILE you are videoing with nothing to do but press the shutter button, which presses with ease and doesnt cause me to wiggle the camera around a lot trying to press it. I also was concerned about the battery life. I have always bought cameras and video recorders that take AA batteries, because of the ease of use and availability. This battery (fully charged) doesnt last quite as long as two AA battieries, but it lasted for over an hour before I decided to replace it. And how did I know it needed replacing? This cool camera tells you right on the screen how many minutes of battery life you have left. I am  NOT a photographer so I cant comment on anything it does photo wise, but just on the Movie mode setting, the stills I got while I was videoing were very nice and clear. I was also concerned about the zoom on cameras because I have watched several youtube videos where the person would zoom in and it would take a few seconds for the the camera to focus. Well not with this gem. The only time I ever had a bit of a focus problem was when I aimed the camera to the ground for a couple seconds and then aimed it at the concert and zoomed. I zoomed out and in and it adjusted pretty quick. The zoom is also very fluid, not jerky at all. It stays focused all the way to the 16x zoom limit. I zoomed all the way in and snapped a photo and it was clear as a bell. I cant think of any negatives really. I would recommend having a few extra batteries on hand and a battery charger. The one I ordered was reduced in price because the package had been opened and it came with an extra memory card. I just use a 32gb memory card. That way I dont have to worry about running out of space. I ordered a battery charger and a couple extra batteries separate. It also had a car charger and a usb charger and adapter included.Oh and one last thing. The venue I attended last night was a smallish club, very low light. It does adjust somewhat to the low light. It will not capture anything in a really dark area tho. And it did at some times white out the faces a bit when they stood directly in the spotlight. I was happy with the results tho.

After using the Sony, she then said \"I LOVE this camera\"! The 16x optical zoom is probably the best feature on it; combined w/ the 16 MP imaging, you can get incredible detail on digital stills, even after zooming in on the actual picture. The best thing about it, as far as I'm concerned, is it's ease of use. My wife is far from a techie; in fact her first response when confronted with any technology is \"I don't know how to do that.\" Not with this thing!There are a couple of things that keep it from a 5-star rating, IMO. First, the flash pops out of the left-top corner of the camera, which is where one would normally have a finger holding the camera in position when taking a picture. It requires a bit of \"retraining\" to not miss your picture when a flash is required. Also, it's a bit disappointing that an hdmi cable is not included w/ the camera, nor is a dedicated battery charger (you must plug the camera into the wall w/ the included charging cable). Obviously, this is meant to keep the retail price down, but these are pretty standard \"add ons\", IMO. Finally, the 3D imaging is still a work in progress. I would not recommend this camera solely for the 3D stills or 3D panorama pics it produces, although I'm sure part of our results are due to the types of pics we have attempted so far (3D photography is a different animal in and of itself).

My wife is very picky with her cameras and I was a bit leery of switching back to a Sony after being with Cannon/Panasonic for a few years.  We tried the Sony out at home for a few basic pictures without using most of the features on it and it passed the initial test flawlessly.During the flight, my wife played around with the camera and started to learn the many options within this gadget (she's not very tectonically savvy).  When we got to Aruba and she started using it, she liked what she saw.  She grew fonder of it the more she used it.  While it does have all the sophisticated features that an SLR camera user would be interested in (shutter speed, aperture, etc), it also provides great shots for a novice who doesn't want to be bogged down in all the settings.  One of the things we've struggled to find with a camera through the years - the shutter speed is acceptable for those moments that need to be captured at a second's notice; and they're clear too!  The 16x zoom is also incredible.  Panoramic photos are great as well.For videos, they're extremely clear and we have the ability to zoom in/out while recording.  Videos were much clearer than the Panasonic and Cannons we've used in the past and those we've seen on more recent models.The two downsides with this camera - size and flash location.  Size wise, it's not the sleek point and shoot most people think of.  It's bulky and probably can't fit in the typical women's evening purse.  I carried it around the entire time we were in Aruba.  That said, it didn't bog us down during our trip and is manageable.  For the other negative, the flash location is right where you hold the camera up with your left hand.  It's inconvenient but you get use to it.  When having others take pictures of us, we simply activated the flash so the picture taker was aware that they couldn't put their fingers over the flash.Overall, we think this camera is great, even given its downsides, and we haven't even used many of the advanced features/settings.

By the time you are zoomed out all the way the aperture is at 6Closeup photos in good light are good but with the 3.3 aperture and excessive jpeg compression the photos in low light and indoors look like watercolors at 100% crop.

With HX9V, it's not an issue as all the pictures I've taken are all very sharp. It even allows you to adjust different levels of soft skin effect. The only thing I can complain about is the way it is designed for battery charging. When you charge with the battery inside the camera, the on/off key will show orange light at the beginning. And after some time, the light goes off. I thought the orange light would turn green when the charging was done but no.

Also would have \"spots\" in my pictures quite often - dust particles bc of the flash...After my disappointing experience w/my NIKON COOLPIX...what became most important to us was....1) a camera that took the picture the moment I put on my finger on the button...NO delay (I missed so many great shots bc my Nikon had that seconds delay)2) non-blurry pictures3) no \"dust spots\" that people call \"orbs\" on my pictures from the flash.So my husband & I went to several professional camera shops in our area & talked to some a few people at Best Buy (who knows how knowledgable they are) but after collecting all the info from people & research online we purchased the SONY CYBER-SHOT EXMOR 16.2 megapixels w16x optical zoom....the EXMOR is the key here according to 2 professionals we spoke with....this was a GREAT purchase!

Because the Nikon was (at the time) $70 cheaper and we had the button issue with the H55, we went with the Nikon.  That was a terrible choice.  We played with it for 3 days, and for every \"decent to good\" picture you took (great seemed like a pipe dream), you took 5 terrible shots.  It was jittery, it had issues with focal points, lighting...everything about it sucked.  We're pretty good photographers, so it was very frustrating and surprising.  We returned it and ordered the Sony.  In the week that passed, the Sony dropped $35, which was a pleasant surprise.  It came 2 days later, and it's been a dream ever since.  Portraits, back light, low light, full zoom, action, pets, aquarium...every picture, every setting, it's been awesome.

So, we're using the Sony battery that came with the H55 (that works, so I know it's not a form factor or voltage issue) and the Sony battery that came with the HX9V.

The other is that I tend to bump the buttons on the back of the camera when using one handed, which I do most of the time.

The HDR and panoramic stitching features require me to carry this along with my Nikon D2Hs and D2Xs and D300 DSLR's.  I love this little thing as a supplemental camera or when I don't want to lug around battleship sized cameras/lenses also. My ONLY major/nearly lethal gripe is the terrible IED like structure of the dials on this Sony.  It takes only thinking about the camera to have it go into various menus or power on the flash etc.  It is the whackiest camera for accidentally hitting a function that you did not want to hit.  I have had the camera for well over a year and use it all the time and YET nearly every single session I am accidentally thrown into the endless menu selections especially the flash on or off one.  I have owned SLR's and DSLR's for years...medium format cameras, film and digital point & shoot cameras by the truckloads, and I have NEVER EVER had this problem..it is like the camera is booby trapped to explode!!!!  It forces me to turn off the camrra and turn it back on for fear of switching on a feature I did not voluntarily select.  Sony on these small but feature laden cameras should have a dedicated feature lock button so that whatever settings you had originally selected are locked in so that they cannot change by some incidental touching of any of the dials. If you want to change the settings, hit the button and go do the changes.Also, IMHO there is an issue with the ease of use of  HD movie format where it is not easy to access or transfer.  Sony has made this an almost impossible task if you shoot in AVCHD format due to how they format and store the video file on the card. They have made this feature unnecessarily difficult to use due to some propriety scheme they came up with which is typical of SONY over the decades....always have something that only Sony or their software can access....and this marketing scheme of being too unique killed them in the VHS format arena years ago since they stuck to BETAMAX exclusively for way too long...The list of Sony zany electronic issues is endless from  using 3 1/2 inch floppies, Memory Sticks, to mini CD's for digital film and still recording, to MiniDiscs for recording,  to the purchase of Minolta cameras and thus condemning their excellent DSLR line to Minolta mount lenses....one of the WORST corporate moves EVER if their gadget masters had even figured out that Minolta was NOT a player any longer of any importance is the DSLR world because it was based on the Minolta SLR model which had already long fell out of favour..........great technologies but WRONG mount and until they change that matrix, Sony DSLR's will be hobbled....They should have paid the cash to either Nikon or Canon and used one of their mounts.  But they want to keep the cash in house and will suffer as a result though their digital camera sensors are used in other brands.So here we have this magnificent DSC-HX9V point & shoot camera but it suffers from a horrible design where just one bad move of a finger or a thumb results in total menu chaos and where the AVCHD capability is undermined by some ultra mysterious problem of accessing the video file to burn a CD or DVD...  Now those of you with a delicate touch and can figure out how Sony has hidden these HD files, then more power to you.  I also own the DSC-HX7V as well having picked up a refurbished model AFTER owning the DSC-HX9V.  It has an almost exact feature set as the DSC-HX9V.  I am conflicted about this rating which should be lower but it would be hypocritical since I have taken so many great photos with this camera.  It really is not a five star because of the history of Sony not quite getting their gadget stuff right.  I own tons of Sony audio components, Sony Handicams, Sony Headphones MDR-XB700 used in conjunction with their totally UNCOMPLICATED/easy to use 16GB Sony Walkman NWZ-345 MP3/media player)....I still buy USED Sony cassette players and CD players like the Sony CDP-XE500 on EBAY...But for the life of me, they got some hold over nerds who are out of touch with reality in their headquarters and as I fumble with the hairpin trigger activation of menus on this Cyber-shot DSC-HX9V, they all get a heavy barrage of curse words aimed at them.  This camera would have been the best point & shoot camera in history but because of the function actuation design, it just falls apart .....this should have been designed to be a rock solid piece of equipment instead it is a tiny machine gone out of control if you try to handle it in just a normal manner.  Somebody at Sony refused to go outside in the real world in real world conditions and use it as NORMAL people would handle a camera of this size...(baby boomers beware).

Bought an SD4500 when it came out, and was disappointed by the video quality on it; in some ways it was not as good (despite being full HD) as the SD870 (which is only 480p).  And the battery life is truly awful on the SD4500, especially if you are shooting video.  For a concert situation, one extra battery isn't enough - you'd probably need four extra.  I went through two batteries in about an hour on the SD4500, not shooting continuously.  So I was looking for something that would suit my needs a bit better, and reading about the disappointments of the later ZS-series from Panasonic (knowing that the ZS-3 was one of the few ever on par with my SD870), decided to give the newest Sony a try.I took the HX9V along to a music festival this weekend, and have to say that the video was everything I'd hoped for.  Photos as well.  The IS works well on video, only 'shake' came from people bumping into me, or just me moving slightly while on full zoom (which will be true of any camera with that much optical zoom capability).  It handled several challenging situations well, such as a backlit stage (sun going down behind the stage while shooting).  Unenhanced low-light detail on still photos was still slightly better with the SD4500 (without changing away from regular program auto on either camera), but the HX9V turned that into a bonus in a concert situation, being much less washed-out when spotlights were on a performer after dark.  Autofocus on video both when zooming in or out, or when the subject was moving around was better than the SD4500.  Zoom was smooth, though as with all of them it's hard to zoom smoothly when holding the camera rather than using a tripod.  Will agree with another reviewer that the record button itself is a little awkward, and usually resulted in a jerk in frame when trying to find it with my thumb and press it hard enough to stop the recording.  As I get more used to the camera itself though, this may become less of an issue.Battery life was very good.  I took along an extra battery and never had to use it; just charged the one that was in it back up at the end of the day, ready for the next day.  The SD4500, I'd have been through two of them well before the day was over, with the same level of use.

The zoom at 16x is sharp, smooth, and steady!  The pictures seem to reflect true colors, and the video... Oh the video!  The video is phenomenal!However, there were three flaws in the design that I could not get past which made me return this camera.1) The flash.  Yes, as others have mentioned, the flash pops up RIGHT where I've been holding cameras for 30 years!  I might eventually get adjusted to it, but will the mechanism get damaged in the meantime?  What about the times when I hand off the camera to someone else?2) The panoramic mode is buggy.  On standard setting, it's almost possible to capture a full image from time to time... Almost!  In either WIDE or HD Panorama, it's downright impossible!  As you begin to pan, the camera begins some kind of internal countdown.  There is no visible indicator of how much time you have left, so most of the time the camera only records a partial image.  That is, if you're lucky!  If you move the camera too fast, it will tell you that the movement was too fast, and it could not record.  Alternatively, if you move it too slowly, it will tell you that it was too slow and also could not record an image!3) Lastly, the proverbial straw for me was the naming scheme for recorded videos.  When you record HD videos, the files are named 00000.MTS, 00001.MTS, 00002.MTS,... etc., etc.  When you remove the recorded videos (to your PC, Blu-Ray, the cloud, whatever), the next time you record videos, the numbering will begin anew; 00000.MTS, 00001.MTS, 00002.MTS...There is NO WAY to change that.  The photos can be named sequentially, but that option does not exist for the videos.  Aside from the fact that the videos are BURIED in some arcane folder location (\\PRIVATE\\AVCHD\\BDMV\\STREAM\\), you must start the naming sequence from 0 when you empty your memory card or swap it with a new one.I was able to speak with a Sony representative who offered me a solution.  She recommended that I keep the last file from my recordings in the flash card.  That way, the camera would know to start with the next number in the sequence.  That is a pretty lame solution, but thankfully for Sony, that didn't work either.  When I tried that, the camera gave me a message about an inconsistency with the indexing, and although I had left file 00016.MTS in the card, the next video was recorded as 00000.MTS.In my book these are pretty egregious faults for a camera that is supposed to be on the higher end of the spectrum.  For the price of this camera and the fact that it's a Sony, I expected more.  I imagine that the next version may have updated firmware to correct these problems (if not the flash location), so I'll wait and give it another shot then.", "Date": "October 5, 2011"}, {"Title": "Very good video camera but highly compressed audio", "Author": "T.

This seems to be a common limitation for any camera that uses mp4 or AVCHD compression format. Also, when there is low bass playing in the background outdoors, this camera doesn't quite reproduce the environment to where you feel like \"you're there\", and the vocal clarity isn't quite up par to where it can rival a good external microphone or a better built-in microphone like the one on the Canon SX1 IS.

This becomes especially noticeable when playing the files on a higher end home audio system and even my Klipsch 2.1 multi-media speaker system. Compared to my old Canon SX1 IS, which uses the less-compressed .mov format (which is still my reference camera for audio quality), the sound quality is definitely inferior. I produce videos to eventually watch on my high end home theater system, so audiophile sound quality is a definite requirement for me. If Sony can improve on this, they could have the perfect compact point and shoot camera in their hands. I was hoping that this camera could replace my much bigger and heavier Canon SX1 IS, but still didn't quite make it in the audio quality area. I just wish that for a camera with such amazing video quality, as others have stated, would match it with equally good uncompressed, CD-quality audio. Update 2/8/12: Looking further into this audio compression issue, the audio bit rates are as follows for both channels - 256 kbps for AVCHD at 24 mbps and 128 kbps for mp4 (uncompressed audio is over 1450 kbps bit rate like on the Canon SX1 IS).", "Date": "September 5, 2011"}, {"Title": "BAD Flash idea", "Author": "Wayne Nguyen", "ReviewID": "R340LQ9XUNLNPI", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "The flash stop using just after one week.

Even when it works, the feature don't work right around people's fine hair, which shows very noticeable artifact of the sofware trying to cut the subject. I was dissapointed- again, the horrible flash.  They should have kept it like the HX5V and HX7V models.- Menu is not very intuitive- video button is hard to press.  The HX5V was easier to press.- takes too long to switch to video mode - if you're in the photo mode and you want to suddenly record video, it would take more than 3 seconds to switch and then record the video.  Not good for recording little kids running around.  The HX5V model took only 1 second.I'm sending this back back and try out the HX7V instead.  I bought this model because of the 16x zoom and 1080, 60P AVCHD recording capabilities. It turns out, I'm more happy recording 1080, 30P MP4 because it uses much less disc space.

I have not used the 3-D functionality so if you are looking for feedback on that you should cehck other reviews.The camera has some nice functionality (for example the sweep panorama is nice) and outdoor photos are okay, but indoor is really a problem. The screen display is terrible - very deep in the red spectrum - and the quality of the photos are just not good. I am not a novice. I've been taking digital photos for a long time now. I spent hours going over the instructions for this camera, experimenting with the different settings and trying to figure out how to get decent shots but out of every 20 there are only two or three that are usable.The camera has a feature where a series of stills are taken (bursts) and if you are not careful you end up with what looks like a series of double-exposures. When you record, you go on \"standby\" while the camera gets ready, then \"recording,\" then the camera takes a chunk of time to \"save\" the recording. I went to find the last set of recordings I did on the SD card and they are not there, no idea what happened to them. The still shots are all in place.What tore it for me was a recent trip I took with my eleven year old niece to a nearby botanical garden. All kinds of lighting conditions - sunlit, indoor, shadows and light, etc. With her iTouch she took almost a hundred stills, closeup and distant, and some video, easy-peasy. No fiddling, just point and shoot. I compared hers to mine and there is no question that the quality (and share-ability) of her photos and videos is much higher than what I am able to produce.I will keep this for the panorama shots and maybe for the 3-D functionality when I get around to trying that, but it is definitely not the \"go to\" camera I was looking for.", "Date": "March 4, 2012"}, {"Title": "Awesome Camera, a lot of room for improvement", "Author": "J.

Hugo", "ReviewID": "ROU8BVJOJZTBI", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I bought this to replace a Panasonic Lumix DSC-TZ3 that had provided several years of great images and dependability. I planned that my next camera would also be a Lumix, but current reviews put other competitors ahead of any comparable Panasonic. I found this Sony at the top in many reviews,  and in price-checking, got an extraordinary deal at the country's best-known electronics brick-and-mortar retailer for under two-hundred bucks. A week later, it was taking photos in Cancun and Merida, Mexico.This is a great compact camera.  It has an amazing suite of internal programs that makes it almost impossible not to get a good exposure. It's a little eerie to experience the camera in burst mode while taking \"regular\" shots -- it's the auto-bracketing feature to insure a good exposure in difficult lighting, and it does the same for other situations such as back-lighting. On the recent night in early May with the closest moon of the year, I hand-held the camera on a roof terrace as the full-moon emerged from clouds. The camera did it's burst thing, and the results are as sharp as a tripod-mounted shot. Amazing. Then, while the moon was fully obscured by clouds - and the sky was nearly black - I took more shots. The night sky became something from a science-fiction movie . . . the clouds are fully outlined with the moonlight breaking through and around them like sunlight!  The background color is a deep blue with white-gold highlights of the moonlight's rays and highlights. It's automatic Van Gough surrealism! Of course, you control this camera, so you don't have to let it produce such drama.For a mega-zoom compact camera, it's as easy to carry in my front pants pocket as its Lumix predecessor -- for travel, that's critical for a compact camera, otherwise, why not carry a DSLR?I tested almost every feature of this camera, and several do things I've never had access to on any camera: 3D (well, my cellphone does take 3D photos and videos), sweep panorama, 1080p video at 30fps, incredible stabilization, background blur, GPS, etc., etc. At least one Amazon reviewer has commented that the image quality isn't great. I don'tknow what he's using for reference, but I'm getting great results in a wide variety of conditions. Sometimes, I do have to disable some of the programmed settings and get back to basics to capture what I'm seeing in some settings such as interior lighting. But, overall, it's a learning experience like most technology, and it's worth the effort for the things this camera can do. One thing about zoom range of compact cameras -- there are competing models with more zoom power, but there's a limit of the ability of the small objective lens on compact cameras to produce sharpness and clarity over great distances. Atmospheric conditions such as heat waves will render maximum power shots at great distance not that satisfactorily. This camera is at that limit at 16x, and the additional power (20x) coming with other similar compacts can't be that effective in a usable image, at least for distance telephoto. One final note, the LCD screen renders higher color saturation than you'll see in prints or a monitor.

But then it seems to wash out a bit.And I didn't buy an expensive P&S; to fiddle with white balance.The zoom is great, but after a certain point, the pictures get a bit grainy, so effectively you're not going to use 16x zoom.Auto focus outside is pretty good.  Indoor, not so much - you'll definitely miss shots.The video, as I said, is very good.I had a Canon (old one) before, and that thing took forever to focus, but the pictures it took were great.

But it takes excellent pictures that rival my wife's NEX5. And I love the 16x zoom, the macro focus that can fill half the screen with a penny, and of course the small size and weight. At first I used all the SCN modes which are pretty amazing: panoramas, HDR, low light and anti blur, the hidef movies. I never cared about the pure effects that some cameras have: sepia, B&W;, coloring and distortions. The features in this camera use very sophisticated yet useful image processing that expand the situations where you can take pictures particularly with lower light. I have found myself avoiding those SCN modes lately because they do show a processed look. I now use mostly the P mode, and I wish I had more manual control.

It had a GPS; it charges the battery while inside the camera with a versatile USB/wall outlet charger; it had several customizable options for \"scene\" modes (such as snow, low-light, pets, etc); and much more. The camera promised to create digital pics with a super 16x zoom in a compact body. And the camera had a nice screen in a sharp LCD, the buttons and casing feel very solid, with a  rubberized grip on the right and solid/cool buttons all around. In any case, the camera looks good, feels solid, and had almost dream-features on paper for a compact camera. So on PAPER, it seemed like a great idea.The first and probably the most irritating \"feature\" on the Cyber-shot HX9V is the \"pop-up\" flash. I am used to, as most are, to place my right middle and index fingers on my left hand around the camera to keep it steady for perfect pics. But with this camera, the flash pop-ups AUTOMATICALLY, which is even worse then say the Fuji 770EXR (which has manual flash button, so you know it will pop up and it goes FORWARD, which allows finger behind it). Anyway, the flash is easily the most annoying physical feature on the camera.As for picture quality, it turned out, almost every photograph was either too dark (indoors), extremely blurry, or had an orange or brown mix of lighting indoor. :( I will update several pics here so you can see what I mean. By the way, I am NOT a \"rookie photographer\", but someone who has used complex digital cameras (compacts and pro-types) for years and has played and customized pics very well.The Cyber-shot HX9V has just been a disaster for me in terms of pic quality. Regardless of whether the camera sat on a tripod or was carefully held (behind pop-up flash thing), the camera produced shots that were of horrible quality.Most of my pictures, regardless of whether I was using an \"Auto focus/Intelligent Mode/Intel Mode+\" or on \"scene mode\" where I manually select the type of scene, the Sony Cyber-shot HX9V simply produced many blurry pictures , many with so much \"noise\" that they are un-usable without major PhotoShopping. The \"soft skin\" mode actually produced some nice \"paintings\" of my wife, who is Caucasian with medium skin and light-colored eyes. Pics of me, being \u00bd Italian looked ok, a bit \"Eastern European\" \"grayish skin tone\", considering I am Caucasian white as well with bright eyes, so the skin tones were totally off. No joke here, when you zoom into the pics, it makes you think you are looking at an \"over-produced\" painting.Pictures of my orange cat (see attached to product) look absolutely horrible, as it seems like the orange cat \"tricks\" the camera's sensor into producing \"cartoon-like\" pictures of the cat. I mean, the cat was either too dark, inside the room (regardless of \"mode\" or \"scene\") or he looked like a cartoon character cat, as he looks like Healthcliff (the orange cartoon cat from 80s and 90s cartoons, if you remember him).Overall, the Sony Cyber-shot HX9V has produced a barrage of terrible indoor pictures. The outdoor, sunny/bright pictures were ok, but backlight pictures (sun in front of camera) were terrible, with an orange tone. Outdoor pics of the sun behind camera did not trigger flash, which is a huge nuisance, as my target was in partially in shadow. The only time a picture will come out \"perfect\" outdoors with this camera if when the sun is right above... so I am limited to taking pictures between 11am and 1pm!The \"scene\" modes are frustrating, as most do not allow flash. That is completely stupid, as one can try scene modes with and w/o flash and \"override\" the factory setting for awesome pics. The \"indoor\" mode, for example, should allow the user to active flash, as it could produce great pics.  So the restrictions on \"scene\" modes is probably the deciding factor as to how Sony ruined the design of this camera.Oh yeah, if you want another positive, besides the camera's good construction, the flash is actually very strong. In fact, it is so strong, it almost blinds you at close range. -_-Honestly, unless you plan on using the RAW mode or use manual modes to manually adjust every pic, this camera is not for you! The \"Intelligent\" modes need to go back to school and re-learn and become intelligent for real. The \"Scene\" modes had potential, like my old Kodak camera (which is awesome, despite being 7 years old and takes amazing pics to this day), but the restrictions on the flash ruined it.I don't want to miss family moments with cat, wife, etc by having to figure out a manual way to make this camera take some good pics and do not want to be restricted to \"perfect\" lighting outdoor conditions just to get a good pic, so the Sony Cyber-shot HX9V camera is going back today.I will go back and grab a Kodak still left out there or will go with Fuji F770 EXR, as it has the \"scene modes\" I like, and allows me to customize pics as needed, which is why the old Kodak still takes amazing pictures after 7 years. Too bad Kodak went under, they had amazing cameras. -_-But the Sony Cyber-shot HX9V.... no, that is not a good camera at all.", "Date": "October 26, 2012"}, {"Title": "Poor Flash Design", "Author": "Glasairmell", "ReviewID": "R1R329OE0V2QY9", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "Operated this camera for 40 days using the flash about 10 times.

Zoom feature is nice & picture quality great as well. The only thing is, is that you have to SOMETIMES find the right picture setting. Otherwise, if u put it in Automatic (the best picture quality mode setting), it can drain your battery a lot quicker. Also, I must mention, I've had for about 2-3 yrs (I think) & the lens sometimes doesn't close or open completely. An easy fix, but sucks sometimes. Shutter speed also declines slightly. The biggest thing, though, is video quality which is it's greatest feature, along with its panoramic feature & zoom.  Its size, as compared to the DSLR's, makes it pretty marketable as well, BUT If could say this, I'd get a higher version of this. Woit first, though, unti thel price drops since the quality (like many other products) can get slower or go down a little over time. Bought Amazon insurance for it, but I believe it might be expired as it's been at least 2-3 yrs since we first purchased. Good Luck on your decision! Not a bad camera, IF all of it's features stayed the same over time & if a little slimmer.

When you activate the flash it pops up where your finger is gripping the body of the camera.  I use the flash a lot, especially for fill in outdoor shots.  I found the Promaster LED30 Camera/Camcorder Light here on Amazon, and it made my HX9V much more useable.The LED30 comes with a bar that screws into the tripod mount, and the light attaches to a faux hotshoe that holds it securely.  I leave a space between the light and the camera so that I can use the LED30 as a grip.  The camera can be held safely in this manner.The LED30 puts out a light temperature similar to daylight so the Auto White Balance doesn't have any issues with it.  But I generally use the built-in flash for better results.  Sony did not include a feature to reduce the output of the flash, so I had to take the law into my own hands: I put several very thin layers of tape over the flash to reduce the output to a manageable level.By the way, there is also a Promaster LED9 that is even more compact.  I bought one of those also, and like it even better for my purposes.  Since I'm really not using this for illumination, it's a more economical way to improvise a workable grip for the Sony HX9V.

First, to note that I am using MP4 recording at 1080p 25fps rather than AVCHD 1080 60p mode.  I just feel that the file size is something I an handle easier and movie editing is easier using this mode.  So while the movie recording video looks great, the ONE thing that I am very disappointed with is the way the camera records the date (Date Modified and Date Created).  Three things I dislike and I believe #3 is a bug.1. The Date Created is the time stamp in which the movie was taken.  But the Date Modified is the time in which the movie ended.  This means if you recorded a 10 minutes video, the Date Modified actually shows 10 minutes later than the created date.  I don't think this was the case with other camera, certainly not my Panasonic DMC-ZS3.  This means you can not sort by Date Modified.  Especially important when you have more than one camera of different brands and wanting to compile into one folder.  As in, other parents's camera at the same event.2. The video is kept in a different directory than the JPGs. At the very least the MP4 video should be in the same directory as the JPGs and should use the same naming convention so that we can follow the sequence.  here the photo uses the DSCxxxxx.JPG, but the MP4 video uses MAHxxxxx.MP4  WTH?  Panasonic DMC-ZS3 uses the same name and I like the way it's implemented there. When the names are the same with only the extension different,  it makes it easier to sort photos and video to get the sequence of event.  I think many of us like to record things this way.  But the worse part is.....3.  The timestamp of the MP4 video is semi-randomized.  So if you sort by name, you will notice that the Date Created time stamp is not in an ascending order.  Or if you then sort by Date Created, the file name is now not in order.  See below, the file is sorted by name but the timestamp is not in chronological order. They bounce between 7:xx PM and 8:xx PM.  This is definitely a bug.peter-mac:08.

It could be because I hard reset, (pull battery out over night) or did a factory reset and format the card.  The timestamp for both the videos as the photos are correct now.  As one of the user mentioned, why can't the file name be prefixed with DSC rather than MAH?  At least the number increments correctly and it's just a matter of having a software to help rename (text replace) to DSC so I can place both photos and video in the same directory.The battery life is not as good but good enough so far for half day trip.  I do have my GPS on all the time but as others have noticed, the satellite acquisition is a bit slow.  I would suggest getting a 2nd or 3rd battery if you plan to walk around all day with it on most of the time.I am giving it a 5 star.  The best all in one camera I have ever used.

Angry.But here is my experience: the skin improvement feature is excellent. The background blur mode is not impressive. Not impressed by the 3D mode either. The movie mode looks like Animal Planet type documentary quality, except for a noticeable fish-eye like effect, but this isn't a camcorder with a large lens, so that's not a surprise. Hopefully there's some software that can remove the fish-eye effect from the vids. The pictures are great quality.During the day outside I didn't try any vivid or natural color settings, just shot as is and the pictures were satisfactory. I noticed when blowing up pics to look at the background though, that the details weren't sharp, but looked soft, BUT even though soft, it still had much detail, more than previous point n' shoot cams I've used, like the Fuji HS20. Or maybe the softness isn't worth mentioning because I don't have enough experience. I'm seriously considering returning this camera though because of that moronic decision to make the ISO something you need to dig into and have an advanced DSLR degree to figure out, in exchange for something obvious and quick, which is what everyone with common sense wants. I might exchange it for the Canon Powershot SX40 HS 12.1MP Digital Camera with 35x Wide Angle Optical Image Stabilized Zoom and 2.7-inch Vari-Angle Wide LCD Deluxe Bundle With 4 GB Secure Digital High Capacity (SDHC) Memory Card, Digpro Compact Camera Deluxe Carrying Case, and more or a Panasonic Lumix DMC-TS3 12.1 MP Rugged/Waterproof Digital Camera with 4.6x Wide Angle Optical Image Stabilized Zoom and 2.7-Inch LCD (Silver) since it's more weather-resistant and designed to withstand this dusty desert  environment I live in. But the TS3 reviews are troubling.Update: About 30 mins after writing this review I figured on my own how to raise the ISO, however, not above 800. At that point a hand with a padlock flashes. Where the rubber finger rest is in the back of the camera is where the white balance, ISO and always on/off mode settings should be, like skin improvement so that they can be combined with other modes. And though that rubber serves to protect the camera in a fall, the rubber would be much better in other areas to give more protection in a fall.I found some Yahoo Answers answer in response to someone asking how to control the ISO, and this idiot, as are most Yahoo Answerers, gave a stupid typical answer to \"go look here in this manual and you'll find out\" rather than doing any actual thinking and studying on his own to KNOW that for a fact. But, so I check and big surprise there's no explanation in the guide which this answerer said, \"Knows all\". Angry.Anyone care to explain in the comments as to how to get it to go above 800? Like are there modes that I may be on that prevent that? What modes are compatible with 1600 and 3200?Update: Within hours of use it got dust UNDER the lens, multiple areas. And I realized this when I started seeing blackish spots in the pictures.Concerning the \"awesome\" wide angle, the ends of the picture are HIGHLY distorted and looks terrible, so what's the point of it?

In large part, I have to agree with the main points of every review I read:  It takes EXCEPTIONAL pictures, the zoom is extremely powerful and fluid, the video quality is absolutely astounding, and its a very convenient, easy-to-carry device.  I loved everything about it.That is, everything EXCEPT the one flaw that gets pointed out time and again across these reviews:  The location of the flash.Earnestly, the flash on this camera could not possibly be in a worse position.  It comes out EXACTLY beneath where you put your pointer finger on your left hand when taking a picture, and what's worse is that the mechanism that pushes this flash up/down is motor driven.  This is fine if you've only got a light grip on the camera, as the flash will simply push your finger up away from the camera as it rises.  But if you're holding onto the camera tightly, and the strength which with you're holding onto that top left portion of the camera exceeds the strength of that motor that's trying to push the flash up, that's almost certainly going to jam that component of the camera and lead to some very expensive repairs.I spent some time trying to figure out a way to remind myself to not put my finger on that part of the camera when taking pictures, as I really really REALLY did like the quality of the photos I was getting out of it, but it was somewhere around the time that I was considering gluing thumb tacks upside down onto the top of the flash (so they'd poke my finger if I tried to put it there) that I realized I was absolutely terrified to use this camera, and thusly wouldn't get a whole lot of use out of it.  So, somewhat reluctantly, I sent it back.If Sony could have put the flash somewhere else, or even if they'd made the flash function on a spring loaded release (so the flash wouldn't move until weight was removed from it, at which point it would pop into the position that it needed to be in to function) this would have been the absolute most slam dunk, wonderful, fully 5 star product I've EVER bought from Amazon.  But because of that one incredible and incredibly frustrating design flaw, I can rate this camera no higher than 3 stars.Bummer.

There is really nothing wrong with the Canon but its a few years old and I was hoping for a little better picture quality, a little faster start up and more optical zoom from a newer model. I had dismissed this Sony as being a bit overpriced but when it dropped $50 it was a no brainer.Unfortunately I knew I was going to return it as soon as I tried to take the first picture and the flash popped up. I literally could not find a comfortable way to hold it with the flash extended. If you have really really small fingers you might be ok because there is a tiny little ledge behind the flash but my medium fingers were too big for it. I really wanted this camera to work out so I tried to hold it this way and that way and even tried to convince myself I could just take one handed snaps, but in the end it went back.To be fair I knew this camera had a pop up flash when I ordered it but I guess I assumed Sony of all companies would have done lots of product testing and would have addressed this issue so I didn't think twice about it.As a final thought this camera is quite a bit bigger (I knew this going in) and actually a little slower to start up (I was surprised by this) then my old Canon.

My main purchasing criteria were the 16x zoom, high-quality video, and the idea of 3D pictures. I was very happy with this for almost a year, but the limitations of this camera quickly became apparent.The single biggest problem is the JPG compression. It is extreme in this camera. It does a lot of noise reduction, and then it compresses it way more than necessary. Looking back, I consider many of the pictures that I took to be essentially ruined by this process. Despite that, if you need a camera that is relatively cheap with some decent feature, and you need it to fit in your pocket, this isn't a bad choice, but it isn't a good choice either.From here, I moved up to the RX100 (awesome camera, but limited zoom) and the Alpha 65 (really awesome, but it is a big, full-sized camera). I've still been bringing the HX9V to concerts simply because of the zoom. I'm now replacing it with a Fujifilm F900EXR which should outperform the H9XV is every aspect and still fit in your pocket.

I pick this camera because it small but have features of semiprofessional cameras & panorama. This camera comes with a small instruction book, and I think it because most instruction is already in camera \"nice feature\". The zoom is great, clear, and focus very well in both optical and digital 16x is = to 28 to 384 mm on SLR \"very good for such a small camera.\" We are normally have to take pictures of labels and damage product in the ware house, and have to bring them down to take close up 4\" x 5\" label, and now I can just take picture by using the zoom up to the rack itself. This cut down a lot of works.Pros: Many deferent features, instruction on camera, prefect zoom, stabilizer work excellent on the zoom in comparison with other camera, excellent panorama no other camera that I know has it. It has highest processor 16 MP. View the pictures without have to turn it on just press arrow button, and very sharp images LCD. It takes excellent pictures on low light. I like a little grip on the right hand so you can hold it better. Small enough to carry around for such as high power zoom, the digital zoom is also clear, and give a little effect of soft background like SLR camera. It is not a true soft back ground image as SLR because this camera uses digital programs to create it, but it works. Dial and button are easy to use.Cons: Short battery life even if you carry 2 battery still may run out too soon, battery hard to take out, cable on the bottom make it have to lay on the Len or LCD not a good camera protection, should including separate charger like canon this way you can charge a battery while using the other one, also take too long to charge inside the camera. The flash is over expose with light Asian skin color (too light)especially taking picture of 2 deferent complexions this camera can't adjust to correct the skin colors, Panorama does not works with flash., slow processing because after taking picture it take a few second to finish processing this can make you miss next picture. Flash pop up where left hand holding camera you have to remember not to put the hand there. Do not force the flash back in place let it go back in when you shut off this camera, or it can get stuck. This camera is only available in black. After take the pictures, SD card is not working with other camera such as Canon, and not read by my PC's SD card reader, Canon does. Can't not view 3D on the LCD you must view with 3D TV. Only have a few languets not like Canon that have every country even Thai and Chinese. The auto drive up to 10 FPS is stop after 10 I which it continue so I don't miss the action.I add this review because I bought one hx9v for my self due to I like it so much.

I find that this new camera has loads of new features, but takes so long to process each picture, boot up and start / stop video that the joy of taking a good picture is reduced.They also moved the location of the movie button to 1/4 inch / 5mm from the upper right hand corner of the phone, where it is nearly impossible to press to start or stop a movie while holding the camera on the right side rubber grip where one is meant to hold it.  if one can get it started and stopped, placing the button there insures that you will need to shake the camera as you shimmy your thumb down the side to end your video.  One would think that the shutter button would start and stop the video like all other cameras, but NO!!! it takes still pictures WHILE YOU FILM... now... that is SUPER COOL, but i would do that much less than just starting and stopping the video.I am really convinced that Sony released the software on this camera before it should have, and needs to spend some time optimizing the firmware and update it.  Either that, or they need to put less features into the camera or a faster processor.  Either way, this camera will probably always irk you as it lumbers along slowly doing it's business.", "Date": "December 9, 2011"}, {"Title": "Excellent product", "Author": "Fred", "ReviewID": "R3KCOBU0HPEO7W", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Thank you to Amazon for packaging, quick sending, quality of this product and the price.Panorama and 3D effect are so wonderfulVery good product", "Date": "October 9, 2011"}, {"Title": "Average performance with artificial over saturation.

I was happy to score a great price for a brand new, really nice camera (would have been my first digital camera) until I got the camera. Packaging was just right. The Sony box came sealed with a tape with Sony's logo. Opened it and took pictures using cell phone for my record,layer by layer until I got to the camera.The camera had no sticker on the camera face around the area of the lens. It was also missing the plastic tab/loop that has a card dangling from it letting us know about the camera. The LCD also did not have a clear protective film protecting it. I had gone to the store to check out this camera and watched youtube videos opening the box of this camera. They all had the sticker, the plastic tab but did not see a protective film for the LCD. Called Sony to ask questions but I got referred to Amazon. Called Amazon to inform them about the condition of the camera. Tyrika (Customer Rep for Amazon) was sympathetic, took my statements, sent me an authorization label to return the product. Instead of refunding the money, I decided to give Amazon another chance, so I agreed to replace the camera.Replacement camera came 3 days later, packaging was just right. Again, took pictures for my record. Even without getting the camera out of the white protective sac, I can already tell there is no sticker on the camera, no plastic tab and no clear protective film for the LCD. Chatted with Sony's product sales rep. Kathleen E and asked questions how their products are packaged--regarding the sticker, clear film and tabloop. She said all brand new cameras that leave their company will have the sticker and the clear protective film. The plastic tab/loop was not mentioned. The only explanation she could offer was if it is used and not brand new when I purchased it, it could be the previous owner took the stickers off. She referred me back to Amazon. This time I decided to return the item and get a refund. Michelle, Amazon's Customer Rep.,was great and helpful, took my statements, and sent me a return label. She also submitted a report to know how 2 cameras sent to me has ended up with the same condition.I never had a chance to try either one of the cameras sent to me. So I don't how they are as a camera.As soon as I found out there was something different with the packaging, I notified Amazon. I know that what I've complained about are only minor items but these item make me suspicious that I did not get a brand new camera. Even if the sony box was sealed with a sony tape, it makes me think that it was returned, re-packed, and the sony tape replaced but the stickers are gone, clear film is gone, the plastic tab or loop has been snipped if the wrist strap has been attached by previous owner. This happens in the normal course of ownership however short is the time of ownership. Lesson learned.2 stars ** for the way this cameras were packaged (sony box), shipping packaging was 5 stars*****, just right no waste. I don't have an opinion regarding the camera itself (didn't get a chance to use it). I'm sure it is an excellent camera.", "Date": "October 7, 2011"}, {"Title": "Price", "Author": "Dan", "ReviewID": "RUDMXKSQBEAAU", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "OK, first of all, I do not think most of you guys realize this price 19 dollars more than the average list price at sony.com.", "Date": "June 16, 2011"}, {"Title": "Small profile, great features!", "Author": "Eljefe", "ReviewID": "R3A52N93Y4TT9Z", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "This Sony camera lives up to its reviews.

Well what a let down with this camera.  The camera did come on time and in a Sony box with the Sony tape at the end. Upon opening the box I was surpised that it was in a cloth like bag and I was hoping to see the clear film on the  back of the LCD and the stickers on the front of the camera. Neither were there.  I had read a review on Amazon of the same thing happening to someone else and she thought it may be a used or refurb item.  She wrote that she called Sony and they said the items come from them with the stickers and LCD film. So at this point I don't know if I have a brand new camera or not and if I don't that will really bother me.  If I have to pay full price I want a brand new camera. The camera does seem in good condition and I have not \"played\" with it yet, so I don't know what I am going to do.

After i bought it i realized that Sony is still up to its old tricks of forcing you to use its own specific standards. You ask what? Well, the charger is Sony specific (instead of say micro USB) so forget bringing a single cable to charge your camera and your phone and your eReader and/or your Blackberry. And if you lose it - which I will - get ready to pay through the nose for a replacement. Then the camera has the dreadful memory stick, which means I now need to buy a memory stick to USB converter if I want to get the pictures of my firstborn from the camera. In theory that can be done with an HDMI cable I think but 1) Sony does not provide one and 2) my computer does not have a HDMI port. Once I buy the converter and have my photos safe I will take a big hammer and crush the MS and will then use an SD card which thankfully is possible. Why does it piss me off so much? Because I pay a hefty sum for a product that is deliberately handicapped for no good reason. Is the MS better than SD? No. So why have it? Is the Sony specific charger better than a global standard one? No. So why etc.The camera itself? Not blown away by the picture quality, and I find that it takes a long 'processing time' between shots. It feels clumsy to hold and the controls are non-intuitive. My previous camera was a Panasonic (can't recall, an ultra-zoom two generations pre the current one) and I will go back to that brand for my next one.
