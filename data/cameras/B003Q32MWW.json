{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Major Design Flaws", "Author": "Eric D", "ReviewID": "R2OK0G1TMB65LW", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I remember the excitement I felt about getting a low-weight camera (4oz) to help me take great pictures on the fly. I decided on the TL100 after reading some technical review about the marvels of this camera. Little did I know how bad this camera would turn out to be.The TL100 has 2 modes: regular mode and smart mode. While on the smart mode, the camera will self-adjusts to adapt to 10 different shooting environments including dark scenes.The smart mode, unfortunately, results in inconsistent quality pictures and fails to properly adjust to the specific environment.The main design flaw is this: in the Smart Mode, once you got your proper self-adjusting focus on your target (white frame shows in LCD),as you are the push the button to snap a picture, the camera will LOSE the focus BEFORE snapping the picture. In other words, you point at a particular target, the camera self-adjusts, the focus looks clear and perfect, the push the button, the camera, INSTEAD of snapping the picture, plays with the lens again which often takes it OUT of focus, and THEN snaps the picture.This design flaw results in many bad out-of-focus photos.It takes a while between the time you push the button and the time the camera actually takes the picture. Not only do you have to wait, but the camera messes with the focus.The button to switch between smart and regular mode often requires to be pushed 2-4 times before it responds.This camera makes awful night time pictures. Although it makes very good day time pictures.The camera got serviced for bad battery which would run out in a short time. This apparently happened to some other people too. The servicing included implementing a whole checking list, at the end of which the camera was sent back to me.The flaws I described are part of the design and not result of a faulty camera. My camera was not damaged in any way.Is there any reason to but this camera? None that I can think of. I would look at similar offerings from Panasonic.", "Date": "December 5, 2010"}, {"Title": "Samsung TL100-run!", "Author": "lyndairene", "ReviewID": "R39ON0PHETUSUT", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "Worst camera I've ever owned! This was my fifth digital camera. I shoot thousands of images, I've worn out former cameras. I've had this camera for about 1 month and hate it. I'll admit I was seduced by camera's sexy slimness-thought I could trust the brand name. Maybe---one photo in ten will be in focus---maybe. The camera will not hold it's focus. I know how to take good photos. This camera is awful, don't buy this camera. Shame on Samsung for putting out such a dismal product.", "Date": "March 9, 2011"}, {"Title": "Worst Camera i've ever had, wasted money on this", "Author": "Patrick", "ReviewID": "R2XYQ9BS4WSFJ8", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I got this camera a few years ago, and it has caused numerous problems, take a shot then when you go to view the photo usually says file error getting the right smile the right angle and then to be let down by the equipment unable to get the picture. Second thing is ,this camera is super slow, while you wait for the box to turn green to focus it takes a considerably long time and while you wait you could loose your optimal moment. Also about the timing, when you finally take the shot and the flash goes off or you hear the sound of the shot ,when you see the picture it is delayed from that shot like 1-2 seconds so the shot you thought you had with the smile is something else.bad camera ,bad technical flaws ,so my opinion do not get this camera save yourself the time and money.", "Date": "November 24, 2011"}, {"Title": "Great", "Author": "Reecer", "ReviewID": "R1970FZBQCE82A", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Great product for the price, slim design and easy to use. would recommend this for any one on the go.", "Date": "August 5, 2013"}, {"Title": "perfect pictures", "Author": "the old crone", "ReviewID": "R1C903O5DBU0JW", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I wanted to say that i am very impressed by this little camera the  picture quality is wonderful,its easy to  use, it is compact  so you can tuck it in a purse coat pocket or  pants.", "Date": "September 15, 2012"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": "Unavailable", "Features": "12.2-megapixel Captures high-resolution images up to 4000 x 3000 pixels.\n2.7\" LCD monitor Gives you a great image of your shot.\nDual image stabilization: Minimizes shake and vibration distortion for improved image clarity.\nFace detection technology: Isolates subjects in-frame and optimizes conditions to take the best pictures of friends and family.\nAutofocus modes: With auto macro mode that focuses as close as 0.3\" for clear photos even up close.", "Name": "Samsung TL100 12.2 Megapixel Digital Camera - Black", "ImgURL": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41RympEUWtL._SX300_.jpg", "ProductID": "B003Q32MWW"}}
