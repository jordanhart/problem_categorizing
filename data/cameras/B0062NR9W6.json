After a lot of reviewing before purchasing, I decided that the canon t3 was the perfect camera for her.  With everything included, this is really a great deal for someone just starting in the slr range of cameras. The camera itself is top notch. In this price range it is in my opinion the best. Very simple to use on auto, or you can get as complicated as you want with all the different settings. Everything arrived neatly packaged and in perfect condition. I was shocked to see it setting at my house in three days after ordering. So i highly recommend this purchase along with this seller!", "Date": "January 5, 2012"}, {"Title": "canon eos t3 camera", "Author": "bacadk2293", "ReviewID": "RUVGWU5HEDG2K", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "My husband was pleasantly surprised Christmas morning when he opened the boxes containing his Canon EOS T3 and all the accessories it came with.

For the price, this bundle has it all.  I'm not a professional photographer, but with all the tips that come with it in the manuals, I could definitely pull off some great pics like a pro.
