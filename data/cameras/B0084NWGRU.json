I mainly use the manual function on this camera to strengthen my manual shooting abilities, but I also use the automatic settings sometimes as well.So far, I used this camera to take pictures of my friends, nature, and animals, in both indoor and outdoor conditions.  I'm not sure what people mean when they say this is not a good indoor camera because I have taken hundreds of photos indoors and in the dark; they turn out so crisp and great.  Surprisingly, this camera really does great in low-light conditions.  I also like that you can control the ISO, aperture, and shutter speed for manual settings (with a light check on the side).As for videos, the image stabilization is awesome.  I never realized how shaky I was until I compared older camera video footage to the new videos I took with this Canon.  It's not 1080p but at 720p the images are quite clear and crisp. **Clip 720p before watching** This is a video footage of waves at a beach. [...]A few setback to this camera is that it is bulkier than a normal point and shoot.  So unless you have baggy pockets it will not fit in your pant pocket.  I didn't purchase it as a point and shoot so this does not bother me, but I'm certain it may be an important factor for others, in terms of portability.  Also, in general, the battery does not last very long.  If you take a lot of photos with the flash on, you may notice that your battery drains more quickly.  I tested this out and tried taking a full battery life amount of picture using \"Full Flash\".  The batteries lasted a little over two hours with almost constant shooting.  With \"No flash\" or \"Low Flash\", the battery lasts several hours.  I took shots of my brother's football game with \"No Flash\" and it lasted the whole 4 hours I was there.  This would be a good time to buy rechargeable batteries, because you will go through them.  The last problem with this camera is that the charge has to charge before it sets off.  I missed several \"Shoot NOW!\" moments because of \"Charging Flash\", and this was quite annoying to me. The charge can take anywhere from less than a second to up to five or six seconds; and this is true especially if you use flash continuously between shots.So to recap...Pros:1. Great step up from regular point-and-shoot.2. Decent price for what it is.3. Camera/Video images are clear.Cons:1. Battery does not last long, especially with high flash use.2. Flash longer than expected to charge.3. Will not fit in normal pocket.", "Date": "October 25, 2012"}, {"Title": "Great camera... but you need to buy the correct batteries", "Author": "Joel Schweiger", "ReviewID": "R3R839W5NYZ9BO", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I am not a photo guy.. but the camera is great.... I read the reviews and bought Sanyo XX Battery Powered by eneloop, 2500mAh typical / 2400 mAh minimum High Capacity, 4 Pack AA Ni-MH Pre-Charged Rechargeable Batteries from amazon.  Yes the standard batteries it came with only lasted 20 shots, I tested it.  For this type of high energy device you need better batteries.  These lasted over 200 shots and about 20 minutes of HD movies, and that was on the batteries first charge.  I understand the batteries get better and better after a bunch of charges.I have no issues with battery life now... the high end rechargable batteries make all the difference.", "Date": "October 24, 2012"}, {"Title": "Like having digital binoculars (15x zoom)!", "Author": "Brian Rose", "ReviewID": "RS0YY07GK3CZT", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I'm a big hiker, backpacker, nature type, but I didn't want to spend $600 on a camera that lets me accurately zoom in on a breathtaking mountain vista.

I read the reviews and didn't think much about the battery comments. The older model was a battery eater. It needed new batteries every week, but the quality of picture was great. This model is a hundred times worse!I use my camera at least every other day. I have been very careful to make sure it is completely OFF and not in viewing mode when I put it away. If you do not remove the batteries after each use it will need new batteries every time you pull it out!I went to watch my daughter's basketball game. I put brand new batteries in it. 20 minutes idling in video mode, only using it for maybe 2 minutes during that time and I get the low battery message. Disgraceful.Auto and easy settings are worthless which is not that unusual with this type of camera.The picture quality is mediocre most of the time. I have to admit though once in a while when it does work properly they are good pictures.I have owned this camera for two years now using it multiple times a week. After taking pictures with my husband's iphone after my last birth I realized how low quality this camera really is. Will not be buying canon again.

The pictures are bright and vibrant, and with the image stabilization system I hardly get any blurry shots. Movie mode is very good too, much better than my old Olympus Point and Shoot.
