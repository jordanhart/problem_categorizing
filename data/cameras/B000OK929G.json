I have it installed outside of my house and the picture quality during daylight hours is pretty good, no better then any other camera I have 4 others (2) 420 tvls, (2)540 tvls, in fact it fails the others at night due to the fact it fogs up terribly at night so its nightime range is about 10 feet and hazy.Not sure but I thought a camera with 700 tvls would actually look better then cheaper 25 to 30 dollar cameras but this one definately doesn't. I didn't try the included microphone but it looks good enough.", "Date": "June 28, 2012"}, {"Title": "non std connector but good.", "Author": "Zurk", "ReviewID": "R1LWYLUAW7ONW4", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "has a non std bnc connector which reqd an adaptor. this camera works ok. agressive agc so its mostly b&w;  but does switch to color.halo effect at night.", "Date": "June 27, 2007"}, {"Title": "Delivered Wrong Item", "Author": "Larry", "ReviewID": "R113SVUJ1Y9FYW", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I ordered cameras with mini microphones and when I finally got the tech to show up and install them, there was no microphone included.
