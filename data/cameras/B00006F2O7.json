However, as a digital camera, it is nearly useless. What is not written in any posted description, in fact, not even on the package, but hidden inside is the notice that if the camerais turned off, batteries removed or run dead, it will erase all pictures within. So, if you take pictures, make sure you have a laptop with you to immediately download your pictures. With this little restriction it is really just a web cam because you mast have a computer with it.There are better webcams for the price, but this cannot even be compared to a portable camera.", "Date": "October 28, 2005"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": null, "Features": null, "Name": null, "ImgURL": null, "ProductID": "B00006F2O7"}}
