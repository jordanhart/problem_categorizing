It's suits my needs as a beginning photographer very well -but it is by no means a 'pro-consumer camera.'  I believe that the camera is solidly constructed (even though it is a plastic body).  It feels very sturdy and well constructed.  An aluminum body like the P9 would obviously be more appealing, but I can't expect much more than high-grade plastic from a sub-300 dollar camera.I'd rate the feature set of the camera as its weakest attribute -keep in mind that i rated the features as 'good.'  This is clearly a point and shoot camera with enough options to produce excellent pictures in nearly every situation.  Keep in mind, to attain excellent pictures in difficult lighting conditions, you must learn the menus and how the features like Twilight mode.  The only features I would like to see on this camera is the ability to manually adjust the aperture and shutter speed.  I think the camera does an excellent job of automatically choosing, but the option of manually choosing would be nice.  Also, the 2x optical zoom is a little paltry... 3x optical zoom would be nice.  I guess I'd have to spend an extra $100 dollars for the P71 to get those features and 3Mp resolution.  Oh, and the lack of sound while recoding videos is a little annoying, but I think that shooting videos with digital camera's is rather gimmicky and useless.  This feature, or lack there of, means little to me.I felt the image quality was very good...excellent for 4x6 pictures and perhaps slightly larger, but you can always have a higher resolution:) I really am very please with the picture quality and I'm rather amazed at the clarity for such a low budget camera.The menus are very intuitive and I have only glowing praise for the user interface of the camera.  I felt all of the menus were well designed.  Please take the time to learn the menus...it might really help your picture quality.  Overall, an excellent user interface.Lastly, I felt without a doubt, that this camera was an excellent value.  It comes with everything you need to get started.  You can fit 30 pictures at the highest resolution (standard compression) on the bundled 16MB memory stick.  This may seem a little small, but it's equivalent to one roll of film (and of course reusable).  Also, I've seen prices for 128MB memory sticks for around $60-$70 so the prices are very comparable to SmartMedia and other types of camera memory.  I'm very please with the included recharable batteries and charger.  Sure it takes 13hrs to charge the batteries, but I still think it's an excellent value for the money.  There are no additional costs with this camera -unless you want a faster charger or more memory.  Oh, and the batteries last an exceptionally long time.  Mine haven't even come close to running out yet, so I don't know quantitatively how long they last, but I already pleased with the battery life.Overall, this a good buy for consumers looking for a point-and-shoot camera for 4x6 prints (and occasionally larger).  I think this also good for someone just beginning to learn photography because it does offer some primitive manual adjusts, like adjustment of the film speed, and of course all the benefits of digital photography.  Namely, instant feed-back of pictures and no film development costs.I'm pleased with this camera....a good buy.", "Date": "June 26, 2002"}, {"Title": "Solid Point and Shoot Camera", "Author": null, "ReviewID": "R2Z0Z3NLA18FFJ", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I've owned 35mm SLR and point-and-shoot cameras for almost 30 years and have to say I'm very pleased with this camera. The high points:-- 30 flash pictures so far and no red eye-- Size. The DSC-P51 slips easily into a jacket pocket but feels substantial in your hand.-- Image quality. I've used online photo services to have my images printed professionally with excellent results for 4\"x6\" prints. The pictures are acceptably sharp and the color is very good.-- Flexibility. I can easily set-up the camera so my wife and son (who don't like messing with the control menus) can simply grab it, turn it on, and shoot. On the other hand, I appreciate the simplicity of the controls and the range of available features (including the ability to raise or lower the intensity of the flash)-- LCD viewfinder. Clear and sharp--even outdoors.-- Extras. A charger, 2 rechargeable AA batteries, a carrying strap, a 16 mb memory stick (enough to get you started) and a USB cable come with the camera.Things I'm less crazy about:-- Lag time. Call me old-fashioned, but when I click the shutter button I want the camera to take a picture immediately. Like most digital cameras, this one has to think it over for a second or so before it actually takes a picture--an eternity if you're shooting candids. While this is annoying and it's easy to blame the camera, the fact is that only 1 in 4 of the candid shots that most people (including me)take on film cameras pan out anyway. In practice I find that I can still get good shots if I just stick with the shot and don't freak out when the camera goes through its gyrations. If I don't get a good shot, I delete it and snap another.-- Recharging the supplied AA rechargeables. How does 13 hours sound?-- Using regular alkaline batteries. While having the ability to use off-the-shelf alkaline batteries sounds great and can work in a pinch, I've found that the camera draws a lot of juice quickly--especially when taking flash photos. Sometimes this can cause the camera to shut down after I take a shot--a problem I've never had with the supplied rechargeables.Re. accessories, consider buying a Lexar memory stick reader. I have Windows XP on my PC and no additional software was required to use it. Also consider a 128mb memory stick and the optional Sony accessories kit (with fast charger, 2 extra batteries, and case).", "Date": "December 23, 2002"}, {"Title": "Point and shoot, or use the tons of features...", "Author": "Matthew Hunter \"Technology Geek\"", "ReviewID": "R2KP463C2KNVDN", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This camera is truly amazing!  I'd been using it for weeks, taking hundreds of amazing quality images before I even knew it had so many advanced features.  That's one of the things that makes this camera so great...  It's so easy to use out of the box.  The advanced features never get in your way like they do with other cameras.  When you want them, however, they are really very cool.My favorite feature I've found so far is the low-light outdoor portrait.  My friends and I took a trip to DC a couple years ago, and took some pictures in front of different attractions at twighlight with a film-based camera. When we got them developed, all you could see was us... there wasn't enough light for the camera to caputre the background.  With the Sony, however, that's a thing of the past!  Simply put the camera on a solid object or tripod, and turn on low-light portrait mode (very easy to do).  The flash on the camera goes off twice really fast,and then continues capturing in low light mode.  What it  does is uses the first flash to find what is close enough to get with the flash, the second flash captures that image, and then the lens stays open for up to two seconds longer capturing the low light background!  The pictures taken in this mode at twighlight look amazing!  Everything is nice and sharp... beautiful.Another great feature is the ability to use the camera's zoom controls to zoom in on pictures you've already taken when viewing them on the LCD.  Reviewing your pictures is great, but it's hard to tell if someone has their eyes closed in a shot, etc. when you're viewing on a 2\" screen.  Well, with this camera, you can zoom right into their face to see.  Very useful!This doesn't even begin to describe what this camera can do...  excellent quality, perfect color - truly the best digital camera I've ever owned.", "Date": "December 6, 2002"}, {"Title": "Good camera I guess", "Author": "Josh", "ReviewID": "R1TYUW3GVVPPU6", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This was my second digital camera I've ever used.  My first was a Samsung SDC-80, which was a bit of a disspointment, yet there were still some good uses for if used correctly.  Almost the same applies to the DSC-P51 in my opinion. The first 10 shots I took appeared fuzzy, mainly because I couldn't feel the \"half-clicks\" as there are in most other Point-and-Shoot cameras. Later, I found out where the \"half-click\" point was, and from then on, I got amazingly good focus.The twilight mode is ok. It requires a second or two's worth of time to acquire and capture the images though, so you better have a tripod or really steady hands if you don't want blurry pictures.  The camera seems excessively sensitive to light sources than most other cameras I've used, and the entire picture will go dark if there's any \"sunny spot\" or other bright spots on the picture.  In general, if done right, you get perfect pictures.  If there's a slight error, you might end up with a dark or blurry picture.The worst thing about the camera is the JPEG compression.  Of course I don't expect it to save in TIFF or uncompressed mode (1600x1200x24bit = 5.49MB/shot) on ... Memory Sticks, but none of the pictures look \"picture perfect\" at 100% view due to the artifacts from JPEG compression.  Hence why I have to either resize my pictures to 1024x768 or crop to 1500x1200 and reduce to 1280x1024 for my 17\" monitor.  A pain that I will always have to put up with, but ok for those who just want to print on photo media.All that aside, this is a really good 2MP camera for the price it goes for. It's loaded with features that I haven't even gotten around to using yet, and with 3 hours of battery time, I'm loving it.  I'd recommend the camera to anyone who is a veteran of digital photography and know how digital cameras work.  Even if you're not, it's an ok camera to start out with, but don't expect to get good pictures first try - takes a lot of practice.  But after you get the hang of it, the camera is definitely worth the money.", "Date": "June 21, 2002"}, {"Title": "A gem of a camera packed w/ features", "Author": "Matthew", "ReviewID": "R2ONN383557XTI", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I Just got this camera as I'm now stepping into the digital world. I did some research and this camera has some of the best features you can get for under $300. The 2.0 MP is nice even though I never need that high a resolution. The 2x optical, 3x digital is what seperates this camera from p31 but the extra 50 bucks is worth the extra zoom. Very easy navigational menu.Very compact camera. The only 2 things I wish the camera had are:1) capable of recording mpeg audio and 2) bigger LCD screen.To get these features you would need to spend another $150 for the Mavica and I can't afford it.W/ the 16 mb memory stick, i can take 200 pictures before i go to my computer. Also, SOny is having a deal where you get $20 off sonystyle.com if you purchase this camera so i got another 16 mb stick for $5 in case i need a backup.Overall, Great deal.

I had heard that digital cameras are so versatile and easy to use...no more fumbling with film at crucial moments.  The main feature that attracted me to this particular camera was the fact that you can record a 5 min video (without sound of course) on here.  The video will be able to be displayed at about 3/4 the size of the computer screen when you play it back.  You can change that feature to be about 50 something minutes at a pretty small size on playback.  I was thrilled with this prospect as I would be able to record my best friend walking down the aisle at her wedding...priceless.  So far I have found this camera VERY easy to use and the features are great.  You can opt for black and white prints, sepia, or even reverse black and white (which is basically like a negative).  The pictures are incredibly crisp when you view them on you computer and when you print them.  You can also choose to turn off the LCD screen on the camera to save A LOT of battery life and just use the view finder.

I'm now doing the research to buy a new one with higher MP, but this one is still going strong.If you're the type of person who just wants a point-and-shoot digital camera, this one will be pretty good for you. It only has 2 megapixels, but the extra features are pretty handy. You have Black & White mode, Sepia mode, Negative mode, and Solarize mode. It takes little mpeg movies (without sound) and you CAN zoom in and out while recording video- I've heard of cameras where you can't do that. It takes pretty good pictures with good battery life (I love the fact that it came with rechargeable batteries AND you can use AA's) and I've loved using this camera.Now onto the cons. If you use AA batteries, it will eat them up. Your best bet is to use the rechargeables. If you use the digital zoom, the pictures become more blurred, but that happens on all digicams. It takes a while to start-up, but the thing that bugged me most was the time it took to turn the flash on. If you're low on battery life and you press the flash button, prepare to wait a little while. It also takes a while to take a picture if you use the flash as well. The flash function on this camera is poor.I didn't have any problems with this until the past few months, but what did I expect? It's lasted three years already! I began to experience the \"black screen\" problem and just recently, it began flickering as well. But what do I do when that happens? I take out the batteries and put them back in again, but if that doesn't work, I just drop it on a (carpeted) floor and voila! The impact seems to make it work again.Again, you get what you pay for, plus a little more.

(such as if flash were on, the date and time, pic quality, etc.) Also could not take pictures using it the old fashion way, as the pic would be pure black when put on computer. Called Sony, tried for 2 hours to get working. Sony finally told me to send it to them and they would fix it.......for a flat rate of $176.00 plus shipping to and back from Texas!!!!!  If I beat it on my hand, the LCD picture comes back so you can take a picture.  Keep in mind that this camera was ALWAYS well cared for, until it stopped working and in desperation I hit it and the LCD came back on!I would recommend a different brand.

In a panic (like a lot of other reviewers here, I'm finding), I gave the camera a couple of taps.  Lo & behold, the LCD screen came back on...but you know, it's never been the same since.

I've been disappointed with the picture quality since that time.So...while the camera was still working properly, I felt that it was working well.  However, judging by all the reviews here, there are some glitches in the camera's design that probably make it obsolete compared to some of the newer models available now.

It's suits my needs as a beginning photographer very well -but it is by no means a 'pro-consumer camera.'  I believe that the camera is solidly constructed (even though it is a plastic body).  It feels very sturdy and well constructed.  An aluminum body like the P9 would obviousvly be more appealing, but I can't expect much more than high-grade plastic from a sub-[price] camera.I'd rate the feature set of the camera as its weakest attribute -keep in mind that i rated the features as 'good.'  This is clearly a point and shoot camera with enough options to produce excellent pictures in nearly every situation.  Keep in mind, to attain excellent pictures in difficult lighting conditions, you must learn the menus and how the features like Twilight mode.  The only features I would like to see on this camera is the ability to manually adjust the aperture and shutter speed.  I think the camera does an excellent job of automatically choosing, but the option of manually choosing would be nice.  Also, the 2x optical zoom is a little paltry... 3x optical zoom would be nice.  I guess I'd have to spend an extra [price] dollars for the P71 to get those features and 3Mp resolution.  Oh, and the lack of sound while recoding videos is a little annoying, but I think that shooting videos with digital camera's is rather gimmiky and useless.  This feature, or lack there of, means little to me.I felt the image quality was very good...excellent for 4x6 pictures and perhaps slightly larger, but you can always have a higher resolution:) I really am very please with the picture quality and I'm rather amazed at the clarity for such a low budget camera.The menus are very intuitive and I have only glowing praise for the user interface of the camera.  I felt all of the menus were well designed.  Please take the time to learn the menus...it might really help your picture quality.  Overall, an excellent user interface.Lastly, I felt without a doubt, that this camera was an excellent value.  It comes with everything you need to get started.  You can fit 30 pictures at the highest resolution (standard compression) on the bundled 16MB memory stick.  This may seem a little small, but it's equivalent to one roll of film (and of course reusable).  Also, I've seen prices for 128MB memory sticks for around [price range] so the prices are very comparable to SmartMedia and other types of camera memory.  I'm very please with the included recharable batteries and charger.  Sure it takes 13hrs to charge the batteries, but I still think it's an excellent value for the money.  There are no additional costs with this camera -unless you want a faster charger or more memory.  Oh, and the batteries last an exceptionally long time.  Mine haven't even come close to running out yet, so I don't know quantitatively how long they last, but I already pleased with the battery life.Overall, this a good buy for consumers looking for a point-and-shoot camera for 4x6 prints (and occasionally larger).  I think this also good for someone just beginning to learn photography because it does offer some primitive manual adjusts, like adjustment of the film speed, and of course all the benefits of digital photography.  Namely, instant feed-back of pictures and no film development costs.I'm pleased with this camera....a good buy.", "Date": "June 26, 2002"}, {"Title": "It's the perfect 2MP Camera!!", "Author": "Anelys Flores \"(momto3littleflowers)\"", "ReviewID": "R1QQL1PGPF3N2L", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "I don't understand why there's some people complaining about the quality of this camera....

This camera suddenly started flashing a code of E:61:10 and the focus stopped working. To fix it will cost about $170 and is not covered by the warranty (there are scratches on the camera so they assume you dropped it - I didn't). On another note, the included 4 mb memory stick is too low. You have to buy a separate 128 mb stick to take a decent number of photos (Lexar sells one for about $50 that worked fine). If you want a digital camera, save a little more money and get at least a 3 or 4 megapixel and please MAKE SURE YOUR NEW CAMERA IS NOT A SONY if you want it to work longer than a few months!!", "Date": "November 24, 2003"}, {"Title": "Love It", "Author": null, "ReviewID": "R21BA6MR2ARQFH", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "It does what I want it to do which is take good digital pixs.

I like the set-up and quality of the camera itself, but I have had plenty of trouble downloading pictures and the Sony technical help has been adversarial and condescending.We bought our Sony when we had a Windows 98 computer and were able to download our pictures.  The USB port on that computer fried so we got a new desktop with Windows XP.  The camera was not recognized so we called Sony.  After trying 10 different things with a tech guy he told us it was our computer's fault.  We got on the phone with Dell, who told us it was Sony's fault (of course).  I borrowed my father's Kodak, plugged it in and it worked fine!  I've now been on the phone with Sony for 1.5 hours (and counting) explaining the problem.  At each step I've been told there are sometimes problems with hardware....  So what! Fix it!  Finally got a manager that says it's never happened with this camera.  Once again so what! They've presented no solutions or options!", "Date": "December 19, 2002"}, {"Title": "w0rd", "Author": "C.

I got mine expecting less than normal film camera clarity, but got at least, if not more than film quality.  All you need is the camera, a good Lexmark inkjet, and some Photo quality Paper for photo quality prints!  Since i got the Camera, i have always looked to SONY for my digital stuff.
