But after the duct tape that held the battery door shut and the paperclip that holds the battery in finally game up on my old Olympus (8mp) it was time to get a new one. I researched and compared a variety of cameras before deciding on this one.  I use my phone a lot but sometimes just want to have a camera at the ready.  I used this on a field trip with my son to the zoo and the zoom made it like we could reach out and touch the animals.  This is a great inexspensive camera, glad I got it.", "Date": "May 8, 2013"}, {"Title": "Small but powerful", "Author": "deke62", "ReviewID": "R26CPJPSX9QT86", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I purchased this camera as a Christmas gift for my wife.

There are a lot of functions on this camera that we don't use because we mainly wanted a small (portable) point and shoot camera, but I will say that it takes amazing pictures and they are great quality too!", "Date": "October 28, 2012"}, {"Title": "Works great!", "Author": "Chase", "ReviewID": "R1NYKZXSBNP985", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Love this style camera. Very slim and compact - large display and handy features. Was happy to see that it worked OK. A bit skeptical about ordering a refurbished product, but saved quite a bit of $$ by doing so.", "Date": "January 2, 2014"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": "Unavailable", "Features": "Works great still!
