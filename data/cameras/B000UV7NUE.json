Nall", "ReviewID": "R2ZQQ1ZK39BB9Q", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I bought these to record live pipe organ performances.  The pipe organ has a gigantic frequency range, but these little microphones record the sound perfectly.  When I listen to recordings made through these microphones and the Olympus LS-10 digital recorder, the pipe organ sounds exactly the same as hearing it live...and I should know, I've been playing that pipe organ every week for five years!Expensive, but worth every penny.", "Date": "February 6, 2009"}, {"Title": "Ghost Mikes!", "Author": "William J. Sokol", "ReviewID": "R2NWOH20CESK1", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I am a paranormal investigator and bought these mikes to use in my investigations to catch EVP's.  These mikes go down to 20 hertz in sensitivity and also up to 20K hertz.  Some EVPs have been recorded as low as 20 Hz, so I did not want to miss any of those.  My voice recorder internal mikes only go down to 50 Hz, hence why I bought these.  After using them on their first investigation, I was very impressed!  The sound levels were so much clearer, louder, and the low frequency sound heard was amazing!  I was listening through a pair of headphones real time while I was recording.  I definitely recommend this set of microphones for any sound amplification use you might have.", "Date": "February 1, 2009"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": null, "Features": null, "Name": null, "ImgURL": null, "ProductID": "B000UV7NUE"}}
