{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Great camera, but not without limitations", "Author": "Brian Baute", "ReviewID": "R3UM2NHLZIFKTB", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Strengths:1. 4x optical zoom.  Most digicams in this price range only have 3x, and most lower-priced cameras only have a 2x or no zoom at all.2. Pop-up flash.  Many owners of the Coolpix 990 and 950 have significant red-eye trouble.  Popping up the flash on the 995 gets it far enough away from the lens to eliminate most red-eye troubles.3. High resolution.  3.3 megapixels in a quality camera like this is more than enough for most serious amateurs.  The only time this will become a limitation is if you want to make obscenely large prints (probably 16\" x 20\" or larger, and even then I don't think it would be a significant degradation) or if you want to crop significantly and make an 8\" x 10\" or something in that range.  I have been very pleased with my results, even in...4. Auto mode.  The 995 has a steep learning curve if you want to really take advantage of its full feature set.  But its auto mode is intuitive enough that you can take the camera out of the box and start taking quality shots immediately.  The auto mode is no more complicated than any point-and-shoot camera.  Excellent feature.Weaknesses:1. 16 mb CompactFlash card.  This one is really a joke.  Nikon should have included at least a 32mb card and probably a 128.  I strongly suggest purchasing a larger CF card immediately.  Most CF cards have fallen to the 50 cents per meg range now (January 2002), so you should be able to get a good name-brand 128mb CF card for $60 or so.  Do it.  Now.2. Digital zoom.  Worthless.  The pixellization is horrendous, and unless you have a huge amount of light the lens speed is such that you really need a tripod to avoid camera shake.3. Lens speed.  With no zoom the aperture is f/2.6.  The further you zoom, the worse it gets.  If you don't have a tripod, I strongly suggest one (the 995's mount is sturdy and well-made, by the way).4. No case included.  Again, something you definitely need.  I've had very good luck with LowePro, and they're reasonably priced.5. Complicated menu system.  To take advantage of all the features of this excellent camera, you really need to spend significant time reading the manual and exploring the extensive menu system.  Not for the faint of heart.I've given 4 out of 5 stars, with one star removed due to the above weaknesses.  But this is a fantastic camera.  I've had mine for only about three weeks and I've already taken more than 300 shots, many of them excellent.  I highly recommend it.", "Date": "January 4, 2002"}, {"Title": "Easy Workarounds and TIPS", "Author": "Paul Little", "ReviewID": "R1K7MN5UZFOAMV", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Oh the Debates in our household. - She wanted something cheap and cheerful - me having done photography for a living, wanted something I could control, a camera that wouldn't fight back. This was the the perfect solution. (Except that she wasn't so cheerful that it wasn't so cheap!)A - Auto setting- a simple point and shootM - Manual in the loosest sense of the word gives access to the miriad functions and adjustments available.I suspect that many of the problems other users have reported have come from not reading the instructions sufficiently, I still find myself refering back to it every so often to make sure there's something I've not missed. That said the manual control options are very straightforward if you already know ones f-stop from ones elbow...Complaints that the 995 produces softer pics than the 990 arise I suspect, from the fact that the 990 automatically applies more sharpening in-camera. Enter the 995's menu and change its auto sharpening setting to max and the result is an image so sharp yer eyeballs bleed. personally I prefer to back off from crystal tip clarity and apply sharpening later with Photoshop if neccessary. At least the 995 allows control. The same is also true with colour saturation. here I habitually adjust the 995 saturation to +1 which really brightens up our cooler British colours but there's also the option to go the other way- right back to black and white images.Yes- Total manual control of aperture and shutter speed is impractically fiddly, however there is a very practical and effective workaround.In P - program mode, adjusting the thumb dial cycles through the various combinations of Apperture/shutterspeed whilst maintaining correct exposure with its insurpassable matrix metering system. BUT if you want to adjust the estimated exposure, touch the function 2 button, It's right there, right between the thumb dial and the shutter release, just where you need it. Touch that and then use the thumb dial to exposure compensate + or - 2 stops. I find this way far easier than adjusting the Apperture and shutter independantly so I've no complaints.Finally - the hotshoe issue. The Nikon speed flash is marvelous piece of kit and when I used to work with one it's TTL system NEVER let me down (much!). However at over 300 quid over here for the flash and another 90 just for the bracket!! tieing us soley into that system seems just a wee bit small minded and besides, I have a perfectly servicable Mecablitz CT45 already thankyou very much Mr Nikon san.Here's how I use them togetherSet the camera to aperture priority, and match its aperture to the flash's output setting. You can't connect the flashes lead directly to the nikon so instead connect it to a photo electric 'slave' sensor. My tiny slave has a sucker on it so I can stick it anywhere! Activate the cameras on board flash. position the slave so that it is triggerd either by the flash directly or by the flash reflected back from the subject. The slave sees the flash from the camera and triggers the CT45 which I bounce off the ceiling. Works a treat, well usually.I love this camera, it comes everywhere with me. That's the final bonus, It clicks 'flat' and slips neatly into my jacket pocket.Couldn't do THAT with my 35mm kit!", "Date": "January 6, 2002"}, {"Title": "Great camera with tons of features", "Author": "Jonason Keeton \"Jonason!!\"", "ReviewID": "R42ZY6HU02C3K", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I will start off by saying I've had a CoolPix 800 for 1.5 years and was very satisfied with it. However, as I progressed with learning photography, the camera did not allow me to do all I was wanting to do.  The 2x zoom got old having to deal with the teleconverter which did not allow a wide shot to be taken while on without a periscope effect.  The lack of settings control wore thin as I experimented with more advanced picture scenes. I decided to upgrade to the 995 with the 4x zoom being a big factor in my decision along with allowing more control.  I now had 4x zoom without my cumbersome teleconverter and could trick it to use my wide angle WITH the flash.  Note: That is with the old WC-E24 lens, not the WC-E63.  You'll still get a 'shadow' by trying to use the flash with the WC-E63 lens.  Here is what I've gained from my use thus far:This camera is suited for those who want more control. Auto mode works pretty well for anyone just like my 800, but if you aren't going to take advantage of the Manual mode, you may be paying for too much camera. That being said, I had gotten used to my CP-800 doing most of the work. I was completely mortified in the beginning that my 'better' 995 was producing much softer, almost out-of-focus pictures. As others have mentioned, READ READ READ the manual. I'm still in the learning process of this camera since I do not take pictures every day. However, I have absorbed more knowledge of how to use this camera.  My pictures have now exceeded what I could do with the CP-800 after tweaking image sharpening, overriding shutter/aperture/etc settings, and turning continuous AF off. The latter reduces lag in taking pictures and stops most of that clicking noise the lens part makes (normal for this camera).The camera has tons of features and it pays to check up on how to use them. ISO settings go up to 800, although the pictures genuinely turn up noisy (use noise reduction!). Try also 'bulb' (ISO 100) if you have a tripod and steady night subject - it'll turn out vastly better. The QuickTime inclusion was a nice bonus, but more of a gimmick.  This is no digital video camera. The new rechargeable battery is wonderful. I thought this would be bad, but with only one extra battery, I was able to shoot around 200 pictures with the second battery still going. Be sure to get the 8x or higher speed CF cards as the writing lag will drive you crazy on the old 4x ones.  The 16MB that comes with the camera is 8x. The new Quick Review is great to quickly see your picture while being able to still take another.  You can even zoom in on your pictures while reviewing them to get a better idea of what you got (or didn't get) in the picture.  The pop-up flash reduces red (and evil green cat/dog) eye while also allowing the WC-E24 to work (don't tell it that the lens is there and it'll work without a nasty shadow). There are many more resolution settings with a 3:2 setting for those wanting a 35mm-sized picture.  TIFF is available in 2048x1532 and 3:2 (2048x1360) for those 'perfect' shots.  I could go on and on about all of these features, but I'm limited in space :-). It's sufficient to say that most everything is selectable and it takes a while to get used to all of them.The CP-995 is a great camera for those wanting more from a digital camera. Those wanting a quick, out-of-the-box camera may want to look to some of Nikon's less feature-filled cameras (CP-800 is highly recommended!)  The 995 really shines once you start to learn to use the features.  It will take some time to figure which settings work best, but the results are absolutely worthwhile.  Feel free to ask me any questions on the camera.", "Date": "September 3, 2001"}, {"Title": "Sweet, and easy to use", "Author": "Indra Sunrise Geerts", "ReviewID": "R1CPT8157G1WM3", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "OK, if you can afford it, this _is_ the camera to buy. It's easy to use, it's fun, it's intuitive, it takes great pictures. Save up, buy this one.First of all, notice the swivel design? This means that no matter how you hold the camera, you can see the LCD while you take the picture. Over your head, for when you are in a crowd. At knee level, for taking pictures of your grandchildren. Twisted backwards, you can take self portraits while seeing yourself on-screen (this makes for some very nice pictures!).You can look at the camera in your lap, point it in any direction, and take pictures of people without their realizing it. No more rigid poses. No more uncomfortable expressions.The 995 features incredible macro capabilities, allowing you to take pictures of flowers or rings (ebay time!) from under 2 inches away! The detail you'll se is amazing. It also features a 4x optical zoom (very nice, the 990 only went to 3x) and ISO up to 800, which is very rare with a digital camera. Evening photos are now a possibility without a flash.About the only people who I would recomend not upgrading are people who already own the 990. The 995 is lighter than the 990, the flash is directly above the lense (the 990's flash was to one side, making shadows from the side), the flash is a pop-up, virually eliminating red-eye. The differences are small enough you can just wait till the next camera comes out to upgrade.I would recomend saving  bit of money for accessories, though. A 100 meg memory card is very nice (1078 pics at lowest resolution, 7 at full TIFF), an AC adapter is handy, a card reader might be nice for long photo shoots. You won't need spare batteries, unless you are away from power for a very long time, the camera comes with rechargable lithium batteries (2 hours of life, with the LCD on! VERY nice), so you'll save money there. The batteries seem to charge very quickly, and will last even longer if you use the viewfinder instead of the LCD. Can fit optional lenses, but I haven't had a chance to play with that yet.Let me give you a parting example. I took a picture of a silver ring. When I expanded it, I could see myself in the ring. I could read the 1 inch high words on my shirt. In real life, my reflection was about a millimeter high.

I could not be more pleased with this purchase.  Whether you point and shoot with the auto mode orgo for controlled effects with manual, this thing makes wonderful pictures.  The 995 has it all--the pixels, the zoom, the monitor, the close-ups, the convenience AND simple to use.  Like the camera, accessories are precision made albeit somewhat pricey, but hey--you're getting the quality of a Nikon.Every conceivable option is available including telephotolense, wide-angle, fisheye, and assorted filters to name a few.

I spent several weeks researching every camera out there...  The 4x zoom on the Nikon is not as good as the 10x ... but the digital zoom is quite amazing.  I was expecting to see a bad case of pixelation as I have seen on other cameras- but it is not apparent unless you extend the zoom to maximum.  The 3.1 MPixel is better than the 2 MPixel Olympus.  While I do not expect to use full resolution often (most of my pictures will be for computer viewing where 1024x756 resolution is more than adaquate) it will be nice to have it if necessary.  Unlike the Olympus, the Nikon comes with rechargable batteries.Anyway, with all of that analysis behind me, I bought the Nikon and tested it out on vacation.I added a 128 MB flashcard, set the camera to standard resolution and average compression and got 250 pictures on the card- just enough for the trip.The camera is amazing.  With my limited photographic skills I still took great pictures.  The swivel design provides a great amount of flexibility.  I was able to hold the camera at waist level and still see the image.  This provided more stability and kept the images from blurring in low light conditions.I played with using and not using the flash for indoor, outdoor, and night shots.  Night shots without flash were spectacular.  Most indoor shots were also possible without flash.  The camera automatically compensated for the existing lighting.Since many shots were done of marine exibits behind glass, flash was not an option.  These shots all turned out well using natural and aquarium lighting.Controls were easy to learn and became almost instinctive with just a few hours of use.  Showing others how to use the camera was simple.  I had several people take shots of my wife and I.  I would frame the shot and show the other people which button to press.  Instructing others was quite simple.The zoom as mentioned before worked beautifully.  Several times I had to verify that I was in optical only zoom mode since the camera only has a short pause before the digital zoom kicks in when pressing the telephoto button.In extremely bright light I found it more convenient to use the lens rather than the screen to view shots.  No big deal and framing did not present much of a problem.The biggest point of confusion proved to be the auto shutoff of the display after a set period of time.  I increased my delay which has partially eliminated the difficulty. When the camera cuts off all you have to do is slightly depress the shutter and the camera \"wakes up\" in a few seconds.While most of my work up to this point has been in auto mode, I have begun playing with manual mode.  The number of setting options that one has in manual mode is staggering.  Nikon has a user guide available from Amazon which I also purchased.  I got it and I am slowly working my way through the chapters.  The potential for the camera based on the user guide and what I have gathered so far is almost limitless.In short, with the rebate, the camera cannot be beat for price vs features.

At the end of the day, I uploaded the pictures to an online site because my printer had been on the blitz.  I also uploaded to my website so that my family could view the pictures.  Of all the pics taken that day, everyone was asking for copies of mine, so I had to order extras!  Since then, I have taken many pictures of still life, full motion, and everywhere in between, and they've all been wonderful. The color in the photos are so real, you'd never believe it was digital. Reds are red and burgundy is burgundy, no question.  The zoom is great, although I'm ready to step up to an optional zoom before next summer. If I had waited a little longer, I might would've gone with the Canon G2, as the G1 was no contest to this one.  That's the only reason I gave it 4 out of 5 stars, is because the G2 has a higher megapixel, although I like having a higher zoom even more.  I have produced great 8x10's out of this camera, so a higher megapixel for me isn't necessary at this time.  Oh, and 2 of my 5 dogs are camera shy and the swivel is great for sneeking shots in.  3 of the 5 are black, and if you've ever tried to photograph a black dog, you know how tough that is.  Well, even their pictures have turned out wonderful!  Overall, I love this camera and it's the best investment I could've made.

It did not make sense to me, that company like nikon would fall behind to other cameras brands. however, when i looked at 995, i understood why they did it. because it matches up with other 4 megapixel cameras very well. nikon, one of the leading camera companies, came out with coolpix 995 after huge success of coolpix 990. it had great macro ability, awesome picture quality, and nicely built. coolpix 995, which is more like a upgrade version of 990, fixes some of the problems of 990, such as moving the flash to upward side, to prevent the problem that 990 had, by placing the light next to the lense. the zoom was improved to 4X, which is one of the best in 3 mega pixel class, (excluding that incredible olympus 2100 and stuff like that..) and it got a little smaller in size. now, nikon's pictures gives you incredible details and color. despite its slow lense, it captures enough light, not too satulated color, nice white balance, and, practically, everything.  macro feature is uncomparable, and huge selection of manuel features makes this camera the best of its class. 4 megapixel cameras in market right now (consumer models - not srls) uses similar size CCD for 4 megapixels, therefore, giving you more noise, not much better picture. and 995, it gives you the picture you want. thats why it competes with 4 megapixel cameras which is priced similar, same, or even less than 995. if you are a photo enthusiast, and want a camera that will satisfy you, get 995. you won't regret it.if you are rich, or want something better from nikon you might wanna wait for 5 megapixel nikon coolpix 5000 which is coming out late november. oh, and the lenses from nikon - they are worth your money.", "Date": "November 7, 2001"}, {"Title": "Sleek and fun", "Author": "JWH", "ReviewID": "R2W9OBHDQH9DCB", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This is a great little camera. It is small, well constructed, easily transportable and feature-laden. With 3.34 mega pixels, its image quality revivals 35 mm; although I still think my high-end nikkor lenses and SLR are better. However, the image quality from this camera is quite good. Additionally, you can see the image after you take it. If unacceptable, you delete it and take it again. Gone are the days of finding out someone's eyes were closed at the moment the shutter snapped and the days of needing to take multiple pictures of the same thing to be sure that one good picture is obtained. The zoom is improved over the Coolpix 990, and its possible to zoom after you take the picture, so you can crop the image in the camera after it is obtained. The macro mode is particularly sharp and easy to use. By most reports, the pop up flash is insufficient and needs to be supplemented in instances where true flash is needed. However, the pop up flash has worked well for my needs (mostly \"snapshots\" of people.) In automatic mode, the camera will choose very slow shutter speeds at low light levels and objects suffer from motion blur. You need to use the pop up flash in situations where you would just be using faster film and no flash in an SLR. Although obvious, if you are accustomed to film, digital offers the distinct advantage that images are free once the camera is purchased. For the hobbyist, this aids creativity since you are able to take a lot of pictures and experiment, without being inhibited by having to pay for film or processing. There are some accessories you need, so the camera is more of an investment than merely the purchase price. You probably need to purchase a larger memory card than the one supplied. Although images can be stored on your computer, if you are taking a lot of pictures without access to your computer (i.e., if you are going on a long vacation), you may need multiple cards, or something called a digital wallet which allows thousands of images to be stored on a small, portable hard drive.

I have added the fisheye wide-angle lense and the SB50 flash and necessary mounting bracket.For regular, goof-proof shooting, the camera is excellent. The pictures are very clear with acurate colors and the main controls are quite simple. One annoyance, which is true for many auto focus cameras, is having to hold the shutter release button down half way to be able to take action shots - especially annoying when it's very cold and hands are numb. This holding down the button is necessary because otherwise the reaction time seems like forever between pressing and having the picture taken.Once you add some options, however, things become a little more complicated. This complication is probably easily solved by reading the manuals a few times. things to note are: when using one of the optional lenses, the built in flash is useless because the lense is directly in its way. When using the fisheye lense you lose the ability to use the zoom (avoid this by not inputting that you are using a different lense in the option menu) Overall, an excellent digital with more options and add ons than most others in this bargain price range.

This camera has enough exposure and resolution control to satisfy most users even for many difficult situations.Our work group has been testing digital cameras for years and in the process have had a good look at many Nikons.  We measure resolution in various ways to get a handle on effective pixel density over the full range of optical and digital zoom.  The 995 fared well in our tests, equaling the best comparably priced Olympus in all but the widest angle setting.  Some felt that the 995 could be optimized in exposure and color saturation even better than the Olympus cameras.I spent a fair amount of time evaluating the wide angle converter lenses.  Near fisheye and wide adapters are available, as are telephoto.  In conditions not requiring a flash, the fisheye and wide adapters worked very well, introducing little distortion or reduction of resolution and color saturation was very good.  However, the 995's flash does not have adequate coverage for wide angle and fisheye images.  This problem is not unique to digital cameras - you'll have to get creative to use these adapter lenses indoors in close quarters.", "Date": "February 26, 2002"}, {"Title": "Finally a digital camera for camera enthusiasts", "Author": "Andrew Lynn", "ReviewID": "REH2ZWO6AJR48", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Gone are the days of the cheesy little novelty item digicam, with its whopping 640*480 resolution, ASA 60 equivalence and lens that does not compare favorably to a Koday Funsaver disposable.

This is probably one of the best I can get for the money.The camera is very easy to use, without looking through the manual I was able to take some good pictures.

Unlike many other digital cameras, it doesn\u00a1\u00aft have any delay when the shutter is pressed which makes it easy to get pictures for moving objects.

I use this camera on a daily basis at work (work is a camera store).  I originally gave it a 5-star review, but after comparing it to the Coolpix 990 (the predecessor to this camera, which I used to own) and playing with the new Canon G2, I have found myself highly unimpressed by the 995.  Maybe it's the fact that the 990 had a different lens (a 3x, the 995 has a 4x), I don't know.  I do know that the quality of the pictures is not nearly as good as those from the 990.  I liked the picture quality of the 990, but I sold it because I wanted several things it couldn't offer.  I wanted an on-board hot shoe, and I wanted a camera that had available accesories that didn't cost an arm and a leg.  Maybe I'm crazy, but paying more than a few dollars for a stupid cable to attach my flash to the camera seems absurd.  I sold the 990 before the 995 came out, and when it did come out, I was hoping for some changes, which if had been made might have convinced me to buy a 995.  Unfortunately, Nikon didn't make those changes.  The manual controls are still tricky and annoying to use (compared to the Canon G2's at least, which are laid out in a very easy to use and understand way).  Why Nikon insists on making manual control so convoluted is beyond me; it's completely unnecessary.  It's things like this that make people who are new to digital want to turn away from it.  Here is Nikon's method of manual control:1.  Flip the power switch to \"M.\"2.  Push in and hold the \"Mode\" button.3.  While holding the \"Mode\" button, turn the control dial until the LCD screen displays the mode you wish (i.e. \"M\" for Manual).4.  Let go of the \"Mode\" button.  Now when you turn the dial, your shutter speed changes.5.  \"Oh, I want to change the aperture.\"  Press in the \"Mode\" button to switch to aperture.6.  Turn the dial to change aperture.7.  \"Oh, I want to change shutt -- oh, darn, my subject moved.  Too late.  Oh well.\"Now, here's manual control on the Canon:1.  Flip the control dial to \"M.\"2.  Control pad on the back--up/down to control aperture, left/right to control shutter speed.  The Nikon 995 has a pad like this on the camera, why isn't it optimized for this use?No on-board hot shoe for the flash.  Still no anti-glare coating on the screen; seeing the screen outside in the sun is impossible without sticking one of those annoying screen-hoods on it.  As for image quality, I find the that image quality isn't as good as the 990.  It's visibly less sharp than the 990.  I did some tests at the store, and the color correction is also pitiful.  I did a side-by-side comparison of the 995 and another high-end camera people often ask to see, the Canon G2.  I took the same pictures with both cameras using the same settings, and printed an 8x10\" from each.  The G2's color correction was far more accurate, plus the pictures were sharp from edge to edge.  The Nikon was sharp in the middle and fuzzy in the corners.  Even my coworkers, the majority of whom are Nikonians, agreed the the G2 took a much better picture.  Both cameras were set *exactly* the same (auto focus, auto white balance, timer exposure as to avoid camera shake, no flash).  And before you say, \"hey, you're comparing apples and oranges, 3 megapixel cameras and 4 megapixel cameras,\" keep in mind that a 3 megapixel camera is very well capable of producing a very sharp 10x15\" print (which I have printed from the original 990 model).  An 8x10\" should be no problem for a 3 megapixel camera, therefore, I feel it is fair to compare it to a camera of equal or higher resolution.To top it all off, Nikon still refuses to bundle some decent software with their cameras.  Nikon View is awful.  For the price of the 995, they should at least bundle something like Adobe Photodeluxe.  Canon is generous enough to include copies of Adobe Photoshop LE with the G2.In closing, I highly recommend you check out the Canon G2.  Nikon is coming out with a new model (the 5000) which is supposed to be much better than the 995, but if it were me buying it, I'd still stick with the G2 because overall I've been more impressed with Canon's line of digital cameras.  They must be doing something right--afterall, Nikon pretty much stole the G2's design for their new CP 5000 model, go see for yourself!", "Date": "August 21, 2001"}, {"Title": "Not easy for manual photographers, but a really good start", "Author": "Doug Dina \"Doug\"", "ReviewID": "RBWH6VHWTGUNS", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I come from the background of using only fully manual SLR's like the F3 and have not adjusted that well to the 995. For one, getting used to autofocusing has been a challenge. Also, the manual's description of features is far from adequate. For instance, it's description of using bracketing is incorrect. When the camera is set on single shooting and in bracketing mode, you must shoot 3 or 5 separate pictures whereby each will be a bracket less than the last. This is far different then shooting with an SLR whereby it will three all three at one time. Also, autofocusing is not that fast nor that accurate. Being able to set the folder where to store the photos on the memory card is great. The upload software that comes with camera is quite nice and very simple.My particular 995 lost it's ability to perform autosensitivity somehow and I have to get it repaired already. This otherwise would be a good feature whereby you don't have to select ISO 100 or 200 as the camera will do that for you. Too bad it does not work. Additionally, Nikon Digital support people don't seem to know the first thing about photography. I have call so many times to learn some of the features because their staff is not knowledgable about the cameras or about photography. Not to be confused with the film based division which are the finest tech support people in the industry.In a nutshell, the 995 is a great camera that will blow you away with the results you will get. The healthy 35-152mm zoom lens is just great along with the many many features it has in it's menus. My wife has the Olympus 3030 which I find takes even more remarkable photos and is far easier to use. But, I bought the 995 and I'm gonna stick it out due to my tireless faith in Nikon. The batteries actually last longer than I thought they would. I bought 2 spare batteries so that I can cycle through them while on vacation.

To say I love it is an understatement. I have been doing photography seriously for over 40 years and waited quite a while before getting a digital camera. This camera has not only not disappointed me, it has performed beyond my hopes for a digital camera. The many choices of settings enable me to capture most any photo I attempt, from very low light (by using the 800 ASA setting) or on Slow Sync with a Tripod allowing the camera to decide the settings...or by using shutter priority to capture motion or aperture priority for amazing portraits.  There are many, many settings to choose from, and learning how to operate everything takes some time.  Read the owner's manual several times, and keep it handy to refer to as you are learning the camera.  Well worth the effort!The pop-up flash does a good job, within the distance that Nikon recommends. With any flash on any camera, it is necessary to pay attention to the recommended distance for use.I also get a lot of fun out of the swivel function of the lens. It is great fun to pull a friend close, hold the camera out at arm's length pointing it back at ourselves and watch in the monitor and take the photo. And holding it is a joy. It's large enough to be able to hold it with both hands, thereby making it very easy to hold still...but it's not overly large. It feels solid and strong and functions like a real camera, not a toy!  I have looked at some of the newer Nikons since this came out, and they don't seem as well built...too much plastic.Let me mention that one of the specs listed here is wrong.

I have been taking photos for 30 (yes thirty) years and graduated from the darkroom to digital with anticipation. I was not disappointed. I have used this camera to convert slides and negatives to digital format with excellent results. The built in flash is good for many situations and you can fiddle with the settings to extend it's range, but an accessory bracket will allow you to use your old flash unit to extend it even more.The accessories I would recommend are the flash bracket, Nikon's wide angle adapter, at least 1 128 Meg flash card and an extra battery. I have filled a 128 meg flash card (about 120 pictures at  the full/fine setting) using the monitor and built in flash for each and still had power to review them.

If focus is OK pictures are good quality - almost as goodas my Nikon N60 but for the computer screen it won't be any better2. most of the photos are fine - I guess the light meatersetc are good3.

This Nikon Coolpix-995 camera is a little bulky & heavy to carry but this brings the advantage of stability in shooting. Handy and functional, easy access to controls. With wide converter the barrel is quite well corrected, comparative with the wonderful Canon lens 2.8/24mm, and far better than Fujifilm 4700 without any wide converter. Poor pictures with the flash in dime light as all cameras with buil-in flash. With SB-80DX becomes a very powerful tool, quick in focusing, precise in exposure metering, with no room for failure - a real professional camera. Mounted on the SK900 bracket you have a nice feel of a trusty tool in your hands. If you attached the wide converter to the Coolpix-995, and you mount it on the SK900 bracket together with the flash SB-80DX, you can put it on the table with no concern that the lens is in danger of scratches or everything to fell apart or to fell down.The 2 batteries are sufficient for a one day trip. The 1GB memory is enough to carry a laptop with you for a one week trip. I never needed a tele-converter. The lens' zoom and the wide converter provided what I needed in the past 60 days since I brought the camera. In automatic focusing a continuous lens-noise is stopped only by the stand-by function. The camera wakeups pretty slowly to my taste. The manual is not very easy to digest, but this is the only way to get the maximum from this camera. The optical viewfinder has an important parallax to correct. I would prefer a digital one instead of the optical and LCD swivel monitor.Bracketing function is obsolete when using the SB-80DX flash.USB was functioning from the first camera connection with laptop.

The 995 flash, for one example is a pop up. It also feels like it is going to break off. The 990 was built all together and gave a great flash and a solid feel. This camera is OK. But if you would prefer a much more solid camera, go with the 990.", "Date": "September 26, 2001"}, {"Title": "Coolpix 995", "Author": "Anon E.
