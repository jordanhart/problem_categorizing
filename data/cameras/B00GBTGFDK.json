The only negative to this unit is the nut is not captive so you must be careful not to lose it, but if you do a standard nut from your other GoPro accessories should remedy the issue.", "Date": "February 19, 2014"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": null, "Features": null, "Name": null, "ImgURL": null, "ProductID": "B00GBTGFDK"}}
