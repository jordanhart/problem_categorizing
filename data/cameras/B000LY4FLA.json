I've been using the camera for a while and the quality of the picture is very good, almost as good as a Canon SD 630 that I have. I like cameras that come with AA batteries, in this particular case, the 2 AA batteries would last 100s of pictures if you don't use the flash much. The camera is very easy to operate, and it's very handy. The videos that you can make are very good in quality of sound and image. I usually take pictures at 3.1MP, and it's good enough pixels to develop at 5x7 pictures. If you want to buy a camera for 120 dollars approx, this camera will not disappoint you.

The most important thing is the ease of use ... this truly is a \"point-and-shoot\" camera.  One of the first things I did was to take the same photograph several times with different settings.  I didn't exactly master the settings, but it did help me adjust to the camera.  To be honest, the \"Auto\" setting really works the best.  I've been disappointed with some of the photos I've taken using the other settings, though several work very well (Close-Up, Night Portrait, and Landscape in particular). In fairness, some of the disppointing shots could be because I'm still learning the camera.  Daytime photos have been clear and true-to-color, but nighttime and low light photos are sometimes grainy (using the Low Light setting does help, but not in every situation).  Probably the biggest challenge with this camera is the timing.  There is a delay when you press the button, and I've missed a lot of \"in-action\" photos.  With a slight adjustment, though, I've been largely able to overcome this.  There is a \"Sport\" setting, but I haven't used it with much success yet.  If you are looking for a camera to catch a lot of sporting events, you might want to consider a more sophisticated SLR.Downloading photos and working with the memory card are both easy as can be - I never even consulted the manual.  It's even easier if you use Kodak's EasyShare online system to send photos to family and friends.  While not as slim as some models, the C653 is relatively small, easy to transport and sturdy (it's been banged around a lot in my beach bag this summer - and dropped at least once - and doesn't look any worse for the wear).  The video option works quite well, and you can freeze photos from within the video in a variety of ways, which is a great option with fast-moving subjects.  Overall, the C653 is a good value for capturing simple photos of everyday life, and even some artistic shots.  It's not a \"photographer's camera,\" but it's not meant to be.  The price is more than reasonable for the performance.Two additional notes: be sure to buy an extra memory card if you want to take more than 10 pictures, and go with rechargable batteries.  Regular rechargables don't seem to hold up (and often don't even work), but Ray-O-Vac makes a battery called a \"Hybrid Rechargable\" that fits standard AA chargers and can actually last through several days of photo-taking.  Definitely beats the cost and environmental impact of regular batteries!", "Date": "September 4, 2007"}, {"Title": "NIce, inexpensive camera!", "Author": "J.

I  loved my Z700, even though it was only 4MP and didn't have a lot of the features the newer cameras have. I figured that buying a newer kodak model and upgrading to 6MP would be a no-brainer, but I was disappointed in 2 major areas. First, the lag time is so slow on the C653, when I took pictures of my kids I rarely got what I was expecting to see. The smile or look that I saw when the flash went was long gone by the time it captures. We experimented with tons of settings and there was no difference. The other disappointing area was low-light picture quality. Anything I shot indoors was grainy except where the flash hit. Every background was grainy. Terrible. Using the low-light settings fixed the problem, but then your subject is blurry because you're not in \"Sports\" or \"Kids\" mode anymore (which we used all the time with the Z700 for taking pics of the kids). On my Z700 (which is only $150 now), I could set it and forget it. Set it to \"action\", and it took perfect pics indoors, or out, moving or stationary.

We have a Canon and had a Nikon that could not hold a candle to the picture quality of the less expensive Kodak models.  This unit, however, is a terrible camera. It must have a particularly less sensitive sensor because it gives the blurr warning so often it's pathetic.  Even when you set the camera on higher ISO if not using the flash, you most often get a less than desirable result.  It's simply the worst of all the digital cameras I have and have used.  It does not perform nearly as well as a cheaper, less featured model from Kodak that  I used for the past two years (buttons finally quit working on rocker button, so could no longer access some key settings).The other problem I have with this camera is that, compared to every other model of every other brand I have seen recently, they do NOT put a hard plastic cover over the soft (but nice and large) viewing screen on the back.  It got bumped a couple of times in my pack and now there are are large defects in the screen.  Yes, one could keep such a camera in a case and all, I don't bother.  But check it out for yourself if you like, this is the only digital camera I know of on the market where the viewing screen is not protected by a strong, poly clear surface of some sort.

It was a step up from the JamCam that it went from 1 megapixel to 2 megapixels. It took quite a few great photos, but if anyone moved a little, it was blurry, and it drained its 4 AA batteries like no tomorrow. So in 2007, I purchased the Kodak EasyShare C653 6.1 megapixel camera from KMart for a hundred and thirty new. I had the chance to buy an 8 megapixel camera at the time for round about the same price, but this had an optical viewfinder on it for when the sun got too much for the LCD screen. Plus, I've been accustomed to using an optical viewfinder on all my cameras, including the old film ones. The blurriness factor was also minimized.The image quality was great for me for my amateur needs. Of course the flash did wash out the photos in some instances, but it worked. The 6.1 megapixels worked well for 8 by 10 inch photos. I took photos of my friend's wedding April 2011 with this camera, and one very jealous professional photographer took my photos and decided to put his watermark on my photos to make people believe he took the photos.This camera has a decent video mode that allows zooming in and out on the fly. It even survived a bounce off the sidewalk by my wife.In 2011 I upgraded to a Canon Rebel XS 10.1MP Digital SLR Camera with EF-S 18-55mm f/3.5-5.6 IS Lens (Black) and my photos really did turn out better, although I did lose the video feature, and was at first confused by why the Rebel XS consistently demanded that the background be out of focus unlike this Kodak where everything was in focus. I also lost the many great auto modes that this little Kodak had, since this Canon does not have anything but the very basic features of sports, macro, landscape, night portrait, and portrait.I recommend, even if you get just a simple point and shoot camera like this, to read something like Complete Idiot's Guide to Photography Like a Pro from the library or something. I got the second edition. Or you may probably be able to find some information on the internet, but read about aperture, shutter speed, and ISO, how they work and how they are related. It wasn't until I read up on camera basics that I finally understood what all went into this little Kodak EasyShare camera and what the camera sets itself up for during all those automatic modes that I took for granted once I lost those features with the Rebel XS.I am now giving this much beloved camera of five years to my sister for Christmas. Since getting my Rebel XS in 2011, this camera has just been sitting on a shelf in my closet. My sister wanted a \"good\" digital camera, but she thought that a digital camera for under twenty dollars new was a great investment. So I am handing down this well used and beloved piece of electronics so that my sister can take better photos of her family than with a 1 megapixel cell phone camera. Is it the top of the line? No. Does it take breathtaking photos? Not with my novice eye and inability to compose a shot. However, it is a great learning tool, and has served me well in taking photos of my life. For that, I highly recommend this camera for those novices looking for a good camera to learn from, and I hope yours is as trouble free as this little camera has been for me.", "Date": "December 3, 2012"}, {"Title": "Simple point and shoot camera!", "Author": "Freda", "ReviewID": "R15AGRQCSHZAQP", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This camera has an optical viewfinder and LCD display and takes great photos, very simple to use menu to set date and a no hassle camera.

I liked the camera and my wife did as well. The camera was seldom used and looked brand new when it quit (never dropped, wet or dusty & kept in soft case when not in use.)  The lens stuck in the out position and nothing I tried would make it return, it quit taking pictures as well.  The repair price was $80 plus S/H to Kodak and $91 plus S/H to an independent repair place. Except for the durability issue the camera was the best one we had.  Sad to say Kodak may be the best brand around but it's another brand for me.

I bought it for my husband last year for 140 (tax included) at Best Buy I think.Anyways I really hope noone spends that much.The cons of this camera are what people mentioned: slow lag time when you push down the button to take your pic (maybe 1 second after you push it down) Flash is very bright, software sucks HORRIBLY. THE BIGGEST CON IS THIS: The LCD screen breaks extremely easily, even if you put the camera in a case. The camera was in its case, and in a small carryon suitcase (we were the only ones that had it and were careful with it) and somehow the LCD screen still got cracked. Upon looking for replacement LCD screen, I found out they cost 55 not including shipping. I also saw many many other people posting reviews and complaints about the LCD screens cracking.There is a viewfinder on this, but it makes the camera almost useless. If you buy this camera please dont spend 300 and make SURE you are the type who will be extremely delicate with this camera, and even if you put it in a hard case, the screen might crack. I read about a pen in a girls purse cracking the screen.  It is also quite bulky.One cool feature is the Panoramic setting. You can link many pics for a huge pic.

The major flaw that I have found is that the flash is entirely too bright.  Most of my pictures with the flash come out looking like things are glowing.  I have tried playing with the flash but it doesn't work.Another issue I have with it is that it takes too long to get the picture. Again, I've experimented with settings but it doesn't help.  The pause is long enough to screw up any posed shots (someone thinks the picture was taken and moves) and forget action shots.If anyone moves, the picture gets a blur.  Oh and let's not forget that sometimes parts of the picture seem blurry even without anyone having moved.I can't wait to find a better deal on a camera and get rid of this one.

The Easyshare software \"phones home\" checking for updates every time that your computer boots. This will consume from 30 to 60 seconds, during which time you will be staring at the computer screen.In addition to this, a 45-megabyte resource hog lingers in RAM, reducing your machine's efficiency. When you attempt to shut the computer off, no, wait! There is a program that is not responding! What could it be? __PTAHYDRA is the culprit. What is PTAHYDRA, do you ask? Why, it's something to do with Kodak's Easyshare! You see, when you bought the camera, you also bought a host of problems that will handicap your operating system.In addition to all the above problems, Easyshare does not play by Windows' rules. If you set your Windows Firewall to disallow Easyshare internet access, Easyshare goes behind your back and silently reactivates internet access. In other words, it says \"f-u\" to the customer, you. So part of your bandwidth from your ISP will be permanently allocated to support Kodak corporation selfishness and greed. They think that your internet service is for them instead of you.Instead of installing a buggy and wasteful memory-resident application, Kodak should permit the user to click on an icon when an upload from the camera is desired. Easyshare does not offer this functionality. Happily, Kodak has many competitors.
