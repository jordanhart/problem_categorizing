{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Poor picture quality, grainy with artifacts and noise.", "Author": "A. Bates \"autumnblossom\"", "ReviewID": "R1IEOWR14XNXB2", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "Having had a Casio Exilim Z100 I was hoping that the S200 would offer the same excellent picture quality. Instead, the camera takes grainy pictures even in the best of lighting. The image stabilization softens the picture, removing sharp details. Using the auto setting, as most people do, the camera chooses the best ISO for the setting. When the ISO goes over 200 (which is pretty much every picture) you begin to get a grainy effect, digital noise, that appears almost like bits of static when you zoom in to look at details. As the ISO increases to 400 or higher the noise increases along with it, so that pictures are no longer suitable for zooming in on or making large prints and are better left for small spaces like small pics on a blog or facebook. When the image is clicked on to examine in a new window the viewer will be disappointed.If you are interested in taking pictures outdoors in full light or using the flash every time to combat the ISO issue, then go ahead and get the camera. If you want a camera you can use to capture excellent detail, you will need to keep looking, the S200 is not for you.", "Date": "January 2, 2011"}, {"Title": "Nice Camera", "Author": "urban_nomad", "ReviewID": "R1K9NN2IAJVX57", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Really pleased with this camera. It's designed to do exactly what it's meant to, take great photos while being thin and light. It was thinner and lighter than I expected! There are many times where I don't feel like lugging around my old digital camera yet I am disappointed with the quality of photos my phone takes. This camera is the perfect compromise and can be easily carried around in your pocket wherever you go. What else is slim?, the price. Impressed with the features in a low cost package.It's a keeper.", "Date": "December 30, 2010"}, {"Title": "Excellent at stabilization", "Author": "Barbara A.

I have a hand tremor and thought I'd never be able to take a picture again, but this camera solves the problem. I can take wonderful pictures. The pictures are so good I'm using them in a computer based training course I'm developing. I love the small size too. The only minor issues is it's hard to open the little door for the USB port and it's hard to remove the battery. But then it may be my tremors make it harder. But they are very small and tight. Another thing to watch out for, Amazon doesn't tell you everything that comes with the camera. My sister bought the same camera at Costco and got a SD card and case with hers.

I went from the first to second in order to get the better video. I dropped the second one and needed to purchase this one.I loved the previous two models and would always recommend it to friends who inquired about a good small point and shoot. I can not say the same for this model. I think the picture quality is horrible compared to the two previous models I had. It is so bad that I have stopped using it. I can not explain it other than the pictures (especially when peopl are in them) seem almost like they were painted with colored pencils.
