{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Wow!", "Author": "Linda", "ReviewID": "R1IWLQDHUYKIB3", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I don't even know where to begin. I bought this camera to replace my Canon EOS 40D. Don't get me wrong, I loved that camera, but lugging it around got to be a pain in the neck. It was a heavy camera and with a Tamron 18-270mm attached to it, it was even heavier and clunkier. It was time to pare down. There were a lot of favorable on line reviews on the Olympus E-PL5, the Olympus OM-D E5, and the Sony NEX 6. And, all three are good cameras with excellent image quality. What won me over about the E-PL5 was its price and an excellent selection of lenses to choose from.The first time I got my hands on it after unpacking it, it did feel small in my hands but it had a solid feel to it. I read a few reviews where people complained about how tiny the controls were but I was able to adapt to the layout and buttons just fine.I don't know why Olympus put the power switch right next to the shutter. Until I got used to it, I did accidentally power off the camera a few times while taking a picture. What I like about the power button itself it that the top is illuminated when the camera is powered on.There were a number of complaints from other reviewers about the menus. I didn't find them all that bad but they do take getting used to. The most useful piece of advice I came across was on another Amazon.com review of this camera that recommended enabling the Super Control Panel. For some reason Olympus doesn't use this as a default on either the E-PL5 or the OM-D E5. The Super Control Panel displays all your key settings such as ISO, white balance, auto focus, metering, etc. on the LCD screen. Since the LCD is touch-sensitive, you just tap the setting you want to change and then turn the dial to the desired settings.Enabling the Super Control Panel requires the Custom Menu to be enabled, which Olympus doesn't do by default. To enable to Custom Menu: click the camera's Menu button and select Setup Menu (indicated by the wrench icon) > Menu Display > Custom menu display (indicated by the gears icon) > Yes. Now the custom menu is enabled. To enable the Super Control Panel, return to the camera's main menu and select Custom Menu > Utility > Control Settings > P/A/S/M > Live SCP.OK, so what's it like to shoot with this? F-A-N-T-A-S-T-I-C! The image quality is stunning. It was on par with, if not better than my 40D. The image stabilization doesn't have all the bells and whistles that the one on the OM-D E5 does, but I have no complaints at all about it. It's perfectly fine.The touch screen is wonderful. You have the option of shutting it off altogether, set it to-touch-to-focus only, or set it to-touch-to-focus + take the picture (no need to use the shutter). The latter option is great if you're trying to photograph pets or kids.I bought the 14-42mm kit lens with it. It's an OK lens in that it gives me nice crisp images. But I miss the 18-270mm focal length that my old Tamron lens had. Olympus has a 14-150mm that I'm keeping an eye on and will probably purchase in the future. Along with the 14-42mm I also bought the Panasonic f/1.7.I could care less about the video capability so I can't comment on that. I bought the camera to take still photos, not video.The EPL-5 does not come with a pop-up flash. The flash is separate and you have to attach it to the camera if you absolutely need to use one. The flash comes bundled with the camera. There is no optical viewfinder on this camera, either. But, if you want to use one you can purchase one separately for about $160. It attaches to the same hotshoe that the flash attaches to. This can put you at a disadvantage if you want to use the flash at the same time.The ability to swivel the LCD out so you can shoot from different angles is a super option! I'm shooting a lot from waist level and getting some nice results with it.One word of caution: the camera is light. If you're shooting landscapes and it's windy, I suggest using a sturdy tripod with this camera to hold it steady. Because of how light it is, the wind will buffet it around considerably if you're shooting handheld.The manual that came with the package is a basics only manual but you can get a PDF version of the full manual from the Olympus web site. I was able to download it to my iPhone so I can reference it any time.I'm happy with my purchase and having a lighter load to carry with me.", "Date": "March 31, 2013"}, {"Title": "OMD EM-5 just a little smaller!", "Author": "Brock", "ReviewID": "R3H9ZBHGU5PA52", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I am a professional photographer (weddings, family portraits, commercial, modeling, graduation, etc)  who recently sold every piece of my Nikon gear for the OMD EM-5. Best decision I ever made! No more back focus issues and I have never seen a camera shoot sharper. Image quality of the EM-5 has blown away my expectations. Enter the EPL-5... So far this camera has proven to be a smaller version of the EM-5. The image quality is just as stunning and the autofocus is still beyond amazing! So everyone is aware and if you are wondering if these cameras can compete with the big boys, I have shot weddings in very very dark locations and I have shot portraits in every type of landscape and condition. Professional quality in a small package that will change the way you shoot and really make you think more artistically like we did when we used film.

I have been following the rumor mill and researching the bleeding edge of all compact cameras for the past 6 months, I had no desire to buy an older camera and would probably be considered an early adopter when it comes to all electronics.Just got the E-PL5 yesterday, ordered it as soon as it was available on Amazon for the \"normal\" price not the marked up price it was at initially, along with the kit 14-42mm lens, the Olympus M. Zuiko Digital ED 45mm f/1.8 Lens and the Olympus FL-300R External Flash. These are my early first impressions.Pros:- Excellent shooting menu system once you enable the \"Super Control Panel\" from within the settings. It is mentioned how to use it in the manual but not how to enable it, with some help from Google I was able to enable it. Enabling the Super Control Panel allows you to overlay ALL of your shooting settings while in a shooting mode with the press of the \"OK\" button, you can then select and edit any of these settings.- Customizable software. Can disable, enable and reassign almost every button and function.- Very well built camera body, feels solid in the hand. The tilt screen and the hinges are very well constructed. I also like the feel of the shutter button and the fact that it is separate from the on/off button.- Combination of this camera, the included hot shoe flash and the external FL-300R flash (sold separately) provides a very inexpensive multi flash solution that is extremely simple to use.- Good selection of compatible lenses. The combination of this camera body and the Olympus M. Zuiko Digital ED 45mm f/1.8 Lens was a major selling point for me. Shooting feels instant, pictures, even in low light, are very sharp.- The touch screen is very responsive, touch to focus, touch to focus/shoot modes work great.Cons:- The kit 14-42mm lens all-around performance is terrible when compared to the Olympus M. Zuiko Digital ED 45mm f/1.8 Lens (sold separately). I realize the 45mm is a lot of additional money, but I would not recommend buying this camera if all you plan to use is the kit lens.- This one is obvious, no built in flash. The included hot shoe flash works fine, but the overall package would be a lot more streamlined if the flash was built into the camera.- The touch screen is smaller than I was expecting. When shooting 4:3 the black space on the 16:9 screen is still used to display your shooting settings, but the overall size of the screen is still very small.- Included charger and charge cable is very large. For a package that has a main selling point of portability the size of these included accessories makes no sense. A simple flip out plug wall charger without a cable required would be great.Conclusion: Love this camera, exceeded my expectations in every aspect.Update 2012-11-23: Bought this camera from Amazon on 2012-11-01 for $699, it is now already $599! That is very annoying... why such a sudden significant price drop!?", "Date": "November 11, 2012"}, {"Title": "Great (and possibly best) u4/3 Camera", "Author": "Martin", "ReviewID": "RTQJTF4M9Q3RK", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I must say that this camera is amazing. I have been using a Nikon D7000 before this but I decided to reduce weight and went with the E-PL5, and I am not missing the D7000 at all. I used to find myself ditching the big chunky D7000 in most situations and always carrying around a pocketable point and shoot, unless I was going somewhere with breathtaking scenery. So this camera will actually replace two previous cameras I own (D7000 and my small point and shoot).From what I have seen, this camera shoots images with very comparable quality to mid range DSLRs such as the one I had. The size and features of this thing are right on. The touch screen auto focus is a great feature. The camera does a really great job in low light settings. You can shoot with ISOs up to 3200 and still come out with very decent looking photographs. One thing I must point out though, if you are going to shoot in JPEG, make sure to switch to the Large FINE Quality JPEG setting when you get the camera. I don't know why on earth Olympus did this, but the default setting is Large NORMAL Quality JPEG.I have used the 14-42mm II and 40-150mm R lenses with this camera and they are very good and sharp lenses, but the camera really excels with the amazing prime line up of lenses that Olympus and Panasonic offers. The image quality with these prime lenses are just amazing coming out of such a small body. I also have the 15mm Body Cap lens which is fun to use and makes the camera completely pocketable (which I will use for backpacking trips where I need to shave down on weight). Although this lens is a little soft around the edges, the image quality that it produced was surprisingly much better then I expected (similar quality to mid-to-high range point and shoots). For the attention grabbers out there, I have also had several people that have seen me take off the 15mm Body Cap lens and put on the 40-150mm for close ups and were so impressed that I was able to do that with such a small camera.I was thinking between this and the Flagship OM-D. I am glad I decided to go with the E-PL5. I cannot justify the increased size/weight, and the price difference for getting a slightly better image stabilization system, weather-proofness, and a built in view finder. I actually like the option of being able to stick an external view finder on a very bright sunny day, and not having the carry it around when in low light. Just recently there have been direct comparisons of image quality, noise, and dynamic range between the E-PL5 and OM-D and the results so far, to everyones surprise, show that the E-PL5 actually excels slightly in all three categories (which is making the OM-D owners very angry). The explanation for this seems to be that the E-PL5 does not have a low-pass Filter (AA filter). So all in all, you would be paying double the price of the E-PL5 to get the OM-D for some features that do not make the image quality better which in my opinion is not worth it.If you are thinking of getting a mid-range DSLR and/or high range point and shoot, then you should seriously consider this camera. Most importantly for me, my neck/shoulder does not hurt anymore without the expense of image quality after carrying this camera around all day.", "Date": "January 11, 2013"}, {"Title": "Great Camera in a Small Package", "Author": "Cat Guy", "ReviewID": "R2DWEXN6O66CZ9", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I was looking for a camera with the capabilities of a DSLR but not the size/weight, and having been impressed by the specs of the OM-D, I chose this camera since it shared the same sensor and much of its processing in a smaller size and lower cost.  I had also considered the Sony NEX6 and Panasonic GX-1 but knowing I'd eventually want a more versatile 14-150 zoom for traveling I found the EPL-5 beat these other two hands-down for total weight with equivalent zooms attached.Image quality is every bit as good as I expected but what really stands out is the amazing autofocus (instantaneous) when combined with the touch-screen LCD.  Lightly tapping on the screen to immediately focus on the point touched and trip the shutter makes all the difference avoiding a lost shot. While I'd have liked this camera to have more external analog controls, the mode dial combined with a logically organized menu works well, and after a few days I was comfortable with it. The bundled flash is a nice design and complements the EPL-5 size & style, but with a GN10 it's limited to the equivalent of dinner-table snapshots and fill-flash.  No complaints, but I've already bought a Nissin Di466 that's 100% compatible with Oly's TTL metering for more demanding flash needs.For now I'm using the 14-42mm F3.5 lens and find it works well for normal shooting.  Faster is always good, but considering the weight tradeoff that requires and the low-light capabilities of this camera, I'm satisfied. I saw one complaint from another reviewer about how far this lens extends when unlocked, but I don't find the camera unbalanced considering the len's 112 gram weight on the 325 gram body.  In the locked position the camera & lens fit nicely into a surprisingly small belt pouch, which was my goal in the first place.For 22+ years I was a happy OM-1 user, but when I left film for digital 12 years ago I always missed its SLR quality delivered in (what was for that time at least) a compact package. I'm convinced the EPL-5 is a worthy successor!", "Date": "November 11, 2012"}, {"Title": "Technically great; operationally not so.", "Author": "Jazzmandan", "ReviewID": "R3DWB83ZTTFZFC", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "I believe the PEN E-PL5 to be a terrific camera that's offered at a reasonable price, but with a steep learning curve for even routine (non-Auto) operations--evidently not just for me--and weak associated support.On the physical side, I found the E-PL5 to sit securely and comfortably in my relatively small hands for taking shots at waist-level while using either the excellent touchscreen shutter or the shutter button. However, when holding the camera at eye-level I found the included screw-on grip--currently the largest available, I believe--to be merely adequate for use with 14-42 kit zoom. If you'll be using a longer/heavier lens than this, it would be wise to first test how securely you're able to hand-hold the E-PL5.More importantly, I found the E-PL5's user interfaces documentation to be sadly deficient. But don't just take my work for it: multiple \"professional\" review sites offer \"confusing menu structure\" assessments, and NBCnews.com states simply \"The documentation and settings for the PEN series are just plain bad. The manual is incomplete and the translation is so-so.\" More colorfully, thephobographer.com reports that \"Olympus's unlockable menus contain loads of control over the camera but once you enter them it seems like you're navigating a cave with deadly mummies out to get you; and all you've got is your torch to fend them off.\" You should take a test drive through the E-PL5's menus before purchase or, at a minimum, download the Owners Manual and see if it helps you understand anything.I initially thought that the E-PL5's potential for excellent results would justify the \"sweat equity\" required of me to take advantage of this potential. But over days of reading, trying, searching, decyphering, guessing, cursing, and even calling Olympus, I came to realize that I was wrong.Best of luck with your decision, whatever it may be.", "Date": "May 19, 2013"}, {"Title": "Great camera", "Author": "R. Rana", "ReviewID": "R15S6ID3W01CA4", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Overall, this camera is pretty good package. I have EPL5 with Zuiko 12mm f2.0 for everyday shooting and Zuiko 45mm f 1.8 sometimes (amazingly sharp lens, best pictures it takes on ELP5).Few thoughts and why i'm keeping this camera.1) small camera, i can put it in my jacket's pocket.2) excellent low light camera. I take a lot of indoor pictures of my family and with 12mm and 45mm, there is no need to flash most of the times + images are great.3) Image stabilization is good. not excellent like OMD-E5 but still better than nothing (my D300). it actually takes very few blurry pictures in low light conditions, mainly due to person in motion rather than your hand shaking.4) Amazing pictures with 45mm f 1.8,. The image quality just sold me. I never got this good sharper and detailed image quality with nikon D300 with 50mm f1.8. I'm not a pro, I wanted good image quality so opted for DSLR, but this gives you DSLR quality images or better than my D300 in my opinion.5) Very wide and fast focusing with 12mm for videos. i like to take videos too and this camera takes good 1080p video. I do see a bit of pixelization in high motion mov. AVI is just 720p and is much smoother quality but larger file. Overall, I'm not blown away by video but not disappointed either. I was disappointed with OMD-E5's focusing so i returned it for EPL5. I'm not sure why focusing is slower OMD-E5 otherwise OMD beats EPL5 hands down.6) Has one dial for changing shooting modes. I prefer atleast two to change aperature or shutter speed faster. You can still do it but it's a 2 step process in EPL5.7) tough screen to take a snap is useful at times. you can pick the point where you want to focus and take a picture. I found it useful than replying on camera at times.8) battery is great. I took 387 pictures and dozen of movie. Camera still has plenty of battery. Battery charger is old school chord & it sucks but not a big deal.9) Flash attachment is ok, not great. It's not too powerful and you cannot bounce. With f2.0 and f 1.8 i haven't taken too many pics with flash, since room light is enough. i might buy external flash later on.10) Tilt able screen is good if you wan to bring the camera down to a kid's level and bring the screen at 90 degree to take a shots. I use it a lot.11) There are bunch of built in effect. I like some of them but these are personal choice.12) I'm just taking Jpegs since RAW shows as not supported in Aperature.Overall, I'm very satisfied with this camera and considering selling my D300.", "Date": "November 23, 2012"}, {"Title": "My first (and possibly last) interchangeable lens camera", "Author": "Clayton Abel", "ReviewID": "R3MI98I49H93B4", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I have owned this camera for 6 months now, and I learn something new about its capabilities every week.  Part of that discovery process is that I have never owned an interchangeable lens camera before (and had not gone much past the full auto mode on my point-and-shoot, either), but it is also due to the brilliance of the Olympus PEN series.  Every effort to learn a new facet of photography has  been richly rewarded by the results obtained from this camera, and has only encouraged me to take another step toward mastery.  The full auto setting is great for well-lit applications and even some outdoor, low-light applications, but you will soon get familiar with the manual modes controlling aperture, shutter speed, ISO, etc.  This is where you make the leap from pulling out a smart phone for extreme convenience (but never printing its images) to being intentional about capturing scenes that will be both aesthetically and personally pleasing.  These controls make up the exposure triangle and are the photographer's medium for creativity and the tools for turning the eye's perception into the lasting image.  In fact, the more you discover in photography, the more amazed you will be at the adaptability and complexity of your eyes and the processing power of the brain.  What requires no effort for your brain to account for and perfect, the camera does require skill and speed to accomplish.You can read the specs to find out a lot more, but my review is for people making the transition into higher quality cameras and the questions therein:  I can print beautiful 16x20 images (probably larger, but haven't tried).  With a pancake lens I can fit the camera into a cargo pocket for convenience, though it should not be considered a pocketable camera, as you will want to use your larger lenses often and have them close at hand for everything ranging from street scenes to landscape photography.  The moveable screen is very helpful for taking self shots, low-to-the-ground shots, and high-in-the-air shots (I believe that the cheaper PEN cameras don't have this feature).  The controls and menus are easily navigable, especially if your brain has not been wired to another brand already.  You will NOT reach this camera's limit in the first year of owning it, and I am not sure you will reach it at all as long as cameras are still in use.  Digital Photography School is my source for learning about photography, and I have yet to come across any lessons that require a larger (which is not usually better) or more expensive (which is never better) camera.If the shots you hope to take are worth carrying a slightly heavier load, and if you would like to own a camera that you will not grow out of (though you will certainly want to add to it with various lenses and accessories over time), I can tell you that this camera has been well worth the price of admission.

(see a link to a video example in the comments following this review)However, two factors have together prompted me to increase my rating from 3 stars to 4, because this effect can be negated by using certain Panasonic lenses instead of Olympus lenses.  Several Panasonic lenses have switchable lens OIS, meaning you can turn off the camera's IBIS and use the lens Optical Image Stabilization (OIS). In addition, I have discovered that in both the E-PM2 and E-PL5, Olympus has now added a menu item to allow IBIS to be turned off and lens OIS to be turned on (for lenses that have OIS) even if they lack an external OIS on/off switch. (All previous Olympus PEN M43 cameras do not have a method of turning lens OIS on unless the lens has an external swtich.)This being the case, it is possible to use a wide variety of Panasonic lenses with this body and, using OIS, achieve top notch video results. Unfortunately, this means you must spend extra money to purchase OIS lenses, and it leaves some very fine Olympus lenses relegated to stills photography only, which is a shame.Nonetheless, given that excellent video can be had with the proper lenses, I am increasing my rating to 4 stars from the original 3, as this is truly otherwise a camera that produces exceptional still images and video, with the right lens.  If the camera's IBIS gave good video results with Olympus lenses, I would absolutely give this camera a 5-star rating.Original 3-star review:I have been scouring the web for reviews and evaluations of the video mode in the new E-PM2 and E-PL5 models, trying to ascertain if the new sensor that these cameras share with the OM-D has solved the wobbly \"jelly\" or \"jello\" effect that the E-PM1 and E-P3 exhibited, or whether Olympus has adjusted the digital image stabilization in videos to reduce or eliminate this effect.I have not yet seen this issue addressed in any review of either of these cameras on Amazon, and so far all the reviews I've found on the web have been focused on the still photography functionality of these cameras.Finally today I found this video comparing the Image Stabilization of the OM-D vs the E-PL5.  (Note that the sensor and IS system of the E-PM2 is the same at the E-PL5, and the results shown here are the same if taken by the E-PM2.)As you can see, Olympus has not solved the problem.I hope this information is useful to those of you who, like me, are evaluating either of these cameras for video use.Amazon doesn't allow links in their reviews, but you can find this video at web dot photodex dot com/view/ma2bw28I will also post a link in the Comments of this review.", "Date": "January 16, 2013"}, {"Title": "Probably the best micro four-thirds camera for the price", "Author": "Shawn Blanc", "ReviewID": "R151MLGGRY1JH6", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I bought the Oly E-PL5 because it's several hundred dollars less than the OMD E-M5 but it has the same sensor and processor.

I have Panasonic G5 and a Canon FF, so my review will be comparison to my G5.When I hold it for the first time, I was surprised how solid if felt. Despite the size of point and shoot, it has very good metallic feeling. The battery charges up fairly quickly in couple hours. The grip that you'll attach to the body, is barely enough to have firm grip, like better than nothing kind of thing. The controls are very easy to figure out, except manual setting is a bit awkward. The letters on the screen are smaller than G5, and hard to see for those who are older. The screen resolution is a lot worse than G5, but doable. Touch screen AF is OK, but if you are used to Panasonic's touch AF or touch screen, it's not comparable. Tilt screen is very usable to get angle shot from lower position, but I wish it was an articulate screen that rotates. I really liked the shutter button of this camera to be protruded to make it easy to push. The movie button is easy to push too, but not as much as protruded as shutter button. The body color silver is almost like in-between gold and silver, pretty nice color. The kit lens that comes with is very decent, though I prefer prime over zoom. I did not expect much quality in pics from the zoom but it creates very sharp pics under good light. I put the cap on the highest ISO to be 1600, which is very usable and I did not observe noticeable noise. The kit lens has lock button, which may be cumbersome to some people, who is not used to it to retract the lens and lock it. The mini flash that comes with the camera is okay, but it won't flip enough to be able to bounce it. If you use flash a lot, then you would need a separate and bigger flash.I think this mirrorless camera is sufficient, if you were to use this for street photography or casual nature photography. But for my paid work, I'm still hesitant to use it.

It's incredibly small, and takes amazing pictures for its size.  The kit lens is better than most kit lenses, both in my own experience and according to professional reviews I've read. It's much smaller than I expected, but feels substantial.  I can't believe how light the lens is, in particularly, even though it takes good shots.Alternatives I considered: Sony NEX-5R / NEX-6, Panasonic DMC-G5 / GX1My favorite things about this camera:- Great picture quality:  tack sharp, great color, properly exposed, correct white balance, blurred backgrounds- Fast auto-focus, and it usually picks the right focus point- Low light performance.  I hate using a flash, so the fact that there's not a built-in flash doesn't bother me.  Pictures taken at ISO1600 and 3200 look great, who needs a flash?- Tiltable, capacitive, responsive touch screen.  It's so nice to be able to take pictures from above or below.- Touch to focus- compact size and light weight- in-body image stabilization (IBIS), great, though not the fantastic 5-axis version on the E-M5.- Built-in art filters, I especially like the Pinhole and Diorama (tilt-shift) effects- Surprisingly comfortable to hold, despite its diminutive size - good thumb grip, included front hand grip (though it could be meatier)I'm docking a star for the following reasons:- No in-camera HDR processing.  It can do HDR *bracketing*, but then you have to buy software to merge them later (included software Olympus Viewer 2 does not).- Panorama feature is horrible.  All it does is lock the exposure setting, and displays two white boxes on the screen to give you an idea approximately how to compose one shot to the next.  10 year old digital P&S; cameras I've used do this better, by at least showing you a \"ghost\" of the last image.  Also, you again need to post-process to stitch the pictures together (no in-camera processing).  At least the included Olympus Viewer 2 application does the stitching.- Monster of a battery charger, with a great long AC cord.  I MUCH prefer the more compact Canon chargers that have flip-out AC prongs, so much easier to carry.  So far I haven't found a good aftermarket alternative - there are some out there, but they are cheap made-in-China junk that I'm afraid will burn my house down.- Over-priced OEM accessories. Remote cable release: 40 bucks, viewfinder: 180 or 250, wide-angle converter: 100, etc.  I hate the japanese camera cartel, they don't let sellers set the price they want to charge.

Yes, it is noticeable. Other than that, the PL5 really does perform exceptionally well.  I change my dial to adjust compensation for Aperture and Shutter priority and that changed the whole feel for me so that it is not much less controllable than the OMD.yes, the OMD still is more quick to manipulate but the PL5 is almost as quick to change settings once I customized the buttons.In all, I can happily use either one and be absolutely content with the speed for shooting which easily gives the PL5 a five star.one tip: Get the MCG2 grip. That changed the physical feel and made it so much more handholdable and stable - even more than the OMD in feel.Pairing this with the 14mm 2.5 (I have a very sharp copy) or the 20mm 1.8 makes for an amazingly high performance pocketable camera for me.

The display and menu were quite self explanatory.But more importantly,  this is one amazing camera!  I was in love with my E-PL1 and I did not imagine I would grow out of that camera.  But this E-PL5 really knocked me over!!  This is a great camera for the money!  I see this and other OM-D cameras by Olympus as  nothing less than  Canon/Nikon  DSLR killers.  For now on,  Olympus is the king of digital cameras, as far as I am concerned.  4/3 system always had advantage in edge to edge sharpness due to its 'tele centric' design.  Canon and Nikons had winner in color depth and dynamic range due to bigger sensors.  Well, with these new  OM-D family of cameras,  I believe Olympus has won.  It is the game over for Canon and Nikon!!!!  I don't see why any consumer would choose those  hefty Canon/Nikon DSLR over these slick little  Olympus OM-D cameras.In terms of color, sharpness, detail,  dynamic range,  etc.  this camera is more than a match for any DSLRs out there.  I guess one would have to go to full frame DSLR to get better image quality.  But I cannot be even sure about that.I believe this camera - and other in the OM-D family,  including  E-PM2 -  would satisfy most digital photographers for normal usage.  The small size and weight  for the same top quality images are HUGE advantage for these OM-D cameras.  This camera should have the broadest appeal and  this is one great camera for the money.But I do have to mention one glaring negative about E-PL5:  The new body may be a bit too small. And the provided grip is not adequate.  I much prefer ergonomics of E-PL1.  People with larger hands may have trouble handing this body with one hand.  With two hands it is fine.

I've played with the OMDs but they're just too big and too expensive.  I'd love the Pen, but it's too expensive, and larger.The kit zoom is little more than a token; it kills a lot of this camera has over a point-and-shoot.  More satisfying is a selection of primes (I love the Pana 20mm pancake and Oly 45mm).  Then the image stabilization is crucial -- something most of the Panasonic \u00b54/3 don't have.The flip screen is also a killer feature for taking unobtrusive photos from a good angle.  I don't miss a viewfinder, and find it easier to frame an image on the screen.I love the Oly colors, since I would rather not have to mess with RAW (why I never loved my previous Panasonic \u00b54/3s).  The dynamic range and rich, velvety output is very satisfying.  I've been into photography, film and digital, for decades and this camera, with prime lenses, is the most rewarding and fun camera I've had.Lost star:  The wheel control on mine jumps around, making it very hard to control.  Allegedly a firmware update might improve this, though I'm skeptical since it seems electrical, but I can't load it because I don't have a Windows or OS X computer.  It also has declared two SD cards write protected when they aren't, and refused to use them until I reformatted them on my computer (which could read them fine).Also, the interface is unnecessarily confusing, until you find your way into the menus to turn on the SCP (Super Control Panel).  Then it's very good and should be on by default.  I'd love a decent control wheel rather than the one around the four way controller.  It's ok though, just not ideal.

I bought it with the Panasonic LUMIX G 20mm f/1.7 Pancake Lens and have been pretty happy with the purchase so far. My first impressions are below. Note that I'm not a pro photographer.Things I like:- Image quality is great. Despite some of the features I don't like about this camera, this was the single strength that convinced me to keep it.- Great color reproduction. Colors are warm and vivid without being over-saturated.- Super easy menu system. I picked up on the basic navigation quickly without opening the manual.- Pretty fast shooting. I love using the touch screen focus shooting.- The body is fairly compact for a camera this high quality. I wanted something I could fit in a relatively small purse and tote around easily on trips.Things I don't like:- Less than optimal way of manually adjusting aperture, shutter speed, and exposure. I have to click the up/down or left/right button once just to get into the \"edit\" mode and then again to actually change the setting. The process feels amateurish like the designers didn't fully think this through. On the plus side, there are customizable buttons on this camera so I can choose to map aperture or shutter speed to them and avoid the two-step clicking.- The flip out LCD is a bit awkward to flip out. It takes multiple steps and more force than you'd expect to get it out (just watch any youtube video on this). Also, the screen is thick and adds a lot of bulk to an otherwise slim body. I almost think it would be a better camera without it.- Is it really too much to ask in this day in age for my camera to be wifi enabled and play nice with my other electronic devices? For those of you who are looking forward to the wifi enabled memory card, you'll have to keep in mind the card doesn't come in the box. You have to get it through a mail in rebate and wait 8-10 weeks.The other mirrorless camera I was seriously considering was the Sony NEX 5R. While that camera had many more bells and whistles, I ultimately chose the Olympus for two main reasons. (1) Better lens selection. Yes, Sony will make more lenses eventually. But the NEX line has been around for years now and their Marketing department is probably going through some extreme verbal gymnastics convincing people to keep waiting. (2) Despite the smaller sensor on the Olympus, a number of reviews I found said the image quality is only slightly better on the NEX.Overall, I'm really happy with the Olympus and can't wait to take some amazing pictures with it.", "Date": "December 20, 2012"}, {"Title": "Olympus E M-10", "Author": "Stanley R.

I don't think the menu system is any less intuitive or more complex than any DSLR I've owned--it just takes some time to learn. You can take it out of the box and shoot in iAuto mode but you're buying a very configurable camera body so you might as well learn how to set it up for your needs.I like the ability to reconfigure rear buttons and create MySets and the Super Control Panel makes it fairly quick to change settings while shooting. I shoot mainly in A mode and it's easy to press the up/Exposure button to adjust the aperture and exposure compensation. I find the overall size of the body just about right. It feels rugged enough, I didn't baby it and it still looks and works like new after bouncing around in a day pack and on the floor of a rental car.The kit 14-42mm lens is decent enough for general use. I also bought the Oly 40-150mm and VF-4 viewfinder with the idea of getting some wildlife photos on my trip (i.e. birds). I didn't expect the image quality and response of my Nikon D300 w/200-400mm f4, but for much less weight and size I managed to get some acceptable longer distance shots. Fast moving subjects are difficult though as focus tracking isn't DSLR-fast. I also bought the Oly 17mm f2.8 and used it when I wanted to carry the camera in my jacket pocket.Overall I have an interchangeable lens system that gives me maybe 80% of what I can get out of my DSLR system (60% for long distance fast-moving subjects) at much less cost, size and weight.

I started with the Panasonic GH1 and since then I have collected quite a few lenses for this system (14-140, 20/1.7, 14/2.5, and 45/2.8). While I love the video from GH1 and its overall IQ for stills, but its sensor is really outdated.  In particular in the areas of  the high ISO, dynamic range, and color balance, GH1 is significantly worse than those of the D90, not to mention to newer APSC cameras using the SONY se\u00f1or. The new sensor in OMD and GH3 seem to change all of that.  However,  I do not think I would get the GH3 because it is too expensive for my needs and it is now a much bigger camera. The OMD is also not cheap and about the same size as the GH1. So finally I bought the EPL5, which uses the same sensor as the OMD, but is smaller and cheaper. With a 20/1.7 or 14/2.5, it fits in a jacket pocket with ease.In short, I love this little camera and may soon sell my GH1. Its IQ is substantially better than GH1 AND D90 in terms of high ISO and most importantly of dynamic range. While this camera does not have any command wheels with which to easily change settings, I do not find this to be a big enough issue. When I used the 14-140, I just leave it in P (and see no point to mess with S and A). The video outputs are at least as good as the one in GH1, so for family videos, it is more than capable. The camera is well made and handles well, considering its very compact size. The JPEG images are sharp with very nice color, warmer (slightly more pleasant) than those from the GH1. In terms of JPEGs, they are much better than those from the D90. The IBIS and AF work as advertised and I particularly like the face-detection feature which works wonder to track fast moving kids, even at dim light. Although I use only Panasonic lenses with this camera, I do not see any obvious CA and distortion in the JPEGs, although you may be more critical than me in this area. All in all, I love it and wish Olympus can come up with a fast normal zoom, like the Panasonic 12-35/2.8. I also wish they can find a way to add a built in flash. The camera comes with a nice add-on flash but I tend to leave it home.  Finally, I find the shutter release way too sensitive/light.  It is difficult to half-pressed and hold, and not trigger it all the way.", "Date": "January 2, 2013"}, {"Title": "great camera, with some caveats", "Author": "Vinyl Tap", "ReviewID": "R1VG8K8M872REN", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I've owned this camera for five months now & figured to finally give my 2 cents. All the things you've heard about the sensor is true. It has good dynamic range & pretty clean ISO.The camera fares well against current & slightly older crop sensor DSLRs. I've shot against a D5100 & T2i and IMHO thought the EPL5's pics were better. (The D5100 had a superzoom, T2i had a Sigma 30sh 1.4, EPL5 was with an adapted Olympus 14-54 mkII zoom). If you are thinking about sizing down from an older DSLR, it's a win win on both weight & IQ. (To be fair, I've read that the newest Toshiba sensor inside the D5200 is even more rockin' - I guess sensor tech is rapidly improving).For people wanting to upgrade from a compact point shoot, I just loved my Panasonic LX5, great wide angle on that. However I finally sold it as I could pretty much carry the EPL5 anywhere I could with the LX5. Also, I could easily spot noise from the latter's low light pics.For people who want a pocketable camera, I have the Panasonic 20mm lens, and even with big cargo pants, just don't find it pocketable. Ive never tried the EPM2 but it's slimmer & I'd guess it'd fit with the 20 & definitely should with a Panasonic 14mm?Also, this statement has got me deleted from a message forum, but I'm gonna put it out there anyways. Except for the lenses that came out when this format was new, namely the Panasonic 14mm & 20mm and the Olympus 45mm & 40-150mm (all outstanding \"value\" lenses of this format), lenses introduced afterwards have been pricey compared to their DSLR counterparts - for example, for focal lengths 12mm and below.

Only a couple things lacked in this camera (viewfinder, splash proof capabilities, a couple other small things), however, those things would have cost several hundred more bucks so it's okay by me that they aren't included.I am in love with this camera. It takes extremely high quality photos, even more so than my mothers D-SLR and my roommate's Sony NE-X. I did, however, have a rocky beginning. It might be because I needed to learn more about the shooting modes or it could the menu is somewhat difficult to figure out even for a tech savvy person (there are still things I'm finding that I can do hidden in the trenches of the menu sea). But, at first, I thought about returning the thing. Every picture I took indoors came out with a red tint to it and slightly blurry. I couldn't take any pictures inside that I liked and to have a camera in college, I definitely need something that takes good indoor pictures of moving subjects. I've had it for over a month now and have mostly learned the correct shooting modes for the correct environment. AUTO mode may be the only mode on the camera that I'm not a fan of.

It's very important. Don't do what I did.If you are coming from a P&S; camera then this thing will be a beautiful dream. If you're coming from an Olympus 4/3 DSLR camera (like the e520) you'll be disappointed (in the case of the title above).I got this camera thinking I would use it with the Olympus MMF adapter and my standard 4/3 Zuiko lens collection. That didn't turn out well.If you read carefully there is information about AF Assist with the MMF adapter and LIVE VIEW. Only a few specific AF Contrast (CDAF) capable lenses will work properly with the adapter in Live view. If the lenses aren't CDAF the camera takes about two seconds to focus every time the shutter button is pressed. This is completely unacceptable except in very specific situations (portrait and macro for example).If you want to use your 4/3 lens collection on a micro 4/3 (m4/3) body there is only one way to go and that's the OM-D E-M5. The reason for this is the E-M5 has a view finder and you aren't forced to use Live View (which is the reason for the AF problem). Unfortunately this body is quite a bit more expensive but if you already have several 4/3 lenses then you may be better off biting the bullet.I don't think this camera deserves only 3/5 stars but I find myself forced to rate it as such.I bought a 20mm Panasonic F1.7 m43 lens also and it performs absolutely flawlessly. The low light performance is outstanding. The video performance with this camera is also quite incredible. I was quite impressed overall with every aspect of performance. It far outperforms my old e510.Coming from the larger e510 this camera just doesn't feel comfortable to hold. It is also quite hefty for its size. It feels very close in weight to the much larger e510. The menus are far different and I found them to my disliking. There is a scroll wheel but it's not implemented properly. I should be able to use the scroll to quickly adjust aperture in \"A mode\" or shutter speed in \"S mode\" etc. This is not the case. I think this annoyance has convinced me to bring it down to 3/5 stars along with the other HUGE problem.In the end... absolutely fantastic camera for those getting into this \"DSLR type\" photography (this is not a true DSLR). I highly recommend it over anything else for those types.For the people who are already avid 4/3 fans... it's sad but don't even think about getting this camera. There are some serious focus issues that are well addressed on the web. Unless you plan on selling off your entire collection of 4/3 lenses for m4/3 don't bother with it. There are some 4/3 zuiko lenses that are just so fantastic and irreplaceable (the 50mm F2.0 Macro for example).This PL5 is going back. I'll be getting the OM-D E-M5.UPDATE:I got the OM-D and it has the same problems with focusing using an adapted 4/3 lens as the PL-5. After considering selling my 4/3 collection and switching to the m4/3 line I have decided not to. Check out the lenses available in the m4/3 line. There is not a single decent standard or tele zoom lens (especially not when compared to the 4/3 line at the same price). I only recommend this camera to those who are in great need of a quality camera beyond a P&S; that will fit in your cargo pants pocket. Keep in mind though while the size may be similar to a P&S;, the weight is not.", "Date": "March 1, 2013"}, {"Title": "Rattle sound when recording video", "Author": "hery_susanto", "ReviewID": "RZK8ZXVL14XCD", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "The camera takes great pictures but whenever I recorded videos, there was this rattle sounds that annoy me.

I have been using Nikon equipment since the mid 1980's and currently use a D200, D70, P7000, P300 and others.I use the smaller cameras for trade show shoots where I need light weight and fast handling. I decided to try my first micro 4/3 camera and after reading some good press on the new Olympus OM-D E-M5, and discovering that the E-PL5 uses the same \"guts\", I decided to try it.Camera arrived the other day and, I'd have to say, I'm very disappointed, to a point where I'll probably take the loss and sell it. There are many reasons for this:First of all, it's nowhere near as small as I thought it would be. I now do not understand the popularity of these smaller removable lens \"mini DSLR\" cameras. What's the point if they're not really that small?Extending the lens involves holding a spring-loaded button and turning the focal length ring. Kind of clumsy, and when it's extended, the lens sticks way out there, 3.5\" (I measured it!), making the camera way bigger than it should be and basically overwhelming the 1.25\" thick body. You walk around with a tiny camera with the 12-24 lens sticking out 3.5\". Looks ridiculous.It basically makes handling the camera very awkward, and having to zoom the lens in the traditional way, with the zoom ring, seems awkward because the camera is unbalanced with the big lens hanging off the front, looking ridiculous.The very first time I extended the lens, a plastic ring on the end of the lens fell off (since learned it's for an adapter, but it does not fit correctly on this camera).Then, after only the 3rd time I put the lens cap back on, it broke. Yes, broke. The spring-loaded clip on one side broke off.Usually, I can pick up a modern camera and figure out all the menu choices without looking at the owner's manual. This one is very complicated, it takes some studying before you can figure it all out (if you're using the manual features like I am). Some functions do not work, like the \"super menu\". The full manual on the CD-ROM doesn't fully explain how to use it, and I have tried every button push combination but can't get it to display.The automatic white balance is way, way off. I manually set white balance several times during a shoot, so not really a problem, but anyone using the automatic or 'P' photo setting will be sorely disappointed at the off colors when shooting indoors.UPDATE: The white balance continues to baffle, the auto white balance in \"P\" (Program) mode seems off on this camera. Even setting white balance with a certified white and/or 18% grey card does not set correct white balance in the shadows outdoors. In comparison, my Nikon D200 and P300 have no problems and the P300 especially has excellent auto white balance.The camera does not have a built-in flash, and I didn't think that would be a problem. But the flash attachment is silver, while the camera is black. It looks like the add-on it is. It sticks out on the back side, so the fold-up LCD doesn't fold up vertically with the flash attached. So you have to remember to bring the little flash attachment or keep it on the camera; I'm guessing it will get lost somewhere along the way...Also, the LCD does not rotate out, only up. Not very useful and it doesn't rotate far enough to face the front of the camera, so using it to see yourself is difficult. You'll also have to remember not to lose it when it's not on the camera.The fill flash isn't; if you really want fill flash, you'll have to go to full manual mode and play with the flash settings until you pop just enough to fill, and even then it doesn't work quite as you expect, with either too much or too little flash.The menu system looks unfinished and some of the functions are buried layers deep. That wouldn't be too bad, except every time you open the menu, it starts at the beginning, not where you left off.The 12-42 kit lens focal length isn't great and the f3.5 starting point means you can pretty much forget the A aperture priority setting, it's useless because you can only go up from there, not down.UPDATE: The camera is apparently programmed to default to small aperture settings, even at high ISO in Auto or P modes. This yields razor-thin depth of field focus points when the subject is fairly close, within a few feet. This will disappoint many novice users who will end up with various points of their subject out of focus.The solution is to use the \"A\" (Aperture priority) setting and manually set the aperture, but then you also may have to make sure the ISO is boosted to keep the desired shutter speed. If the shutter speed is too slow, it may not be possible to hand-hold the camera steady enough for a good shotThe scene modes are useless to me, they belong on a cheap beginner camera. I think they have the demographic totally mixed up for this camera -- anyone wanting to use one of the cheesy scene modes does not need a camera like this, they should be buying a point and shoot; conversely, experienced photographers don't need the scene modes and if they really wanted to, they could do a better job in Photoshop. Unfortunately, these scene modes are proliferating on everything but pro cameras lately...Bottom line, this camera is too clumsy for me to use, the menu system seems like a work in progress and the absence of any quick buttons to get to the features anyone other than a rank amateur needs is a problem.This camera is a strange bird, trying to be both a point-and-shoot and a DSLR-type camera and succeeding at neither. It's in between being an easy-to-use point-and-shoot and a DSLR.Pros will need more and quicker controls and easier handling; amateurs won't want to mess with the menu system and choices and will end up putting it in auto anyway, so what's the point? It's too big for easy carry, doesn't fit in a pocket, yet it's too small for easy handling.I should have spent a couple hundred more and bought a standard APS-C DSLR, the difference in size isn't really all that different, as it turns out. My mistake, I'm going to take the loss and sell this one and forget micro 4/3 and these new type small interchangeable-lens cameras. But hopefully others will think twice before buying this.P.S. to the commenters who, interestingly enough, do not own this camera while I do, all I can say is that this is my opinion, having been a photographer since Olympus RC35 days, if you remember that. I have used small cameras like the RC35 all the way to the Nikon P7000, P300, Fuji F31d (a classic) and various Canon and Sony point-and-shoots.", "Date": "November 6, 2012"}, {"Title": "Not a great camera for the price", "Author": "Egypt Seven", "ReviewID": "R188HPEZ0B7H3E", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "I purchased this camera for $666.42 \"CA tax\" and wish I had the chance to look at camera before I bought it.
