{"Reviews": [{"Title": "seems pretty good so far", "Author": "ladylex \"bm265\"", "ReviewID": "R16VF25Q348EQY", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I've had this camera for about 2 weeks so far, and I like it. It has a lot of scene settings, but doesn't seem to have one specifically for indoor pictures, which seems a bit strange. The LCD screen is only 2.5\" but I knew that when I bought the camera. I also noticed that when I was facing the sun the LCD screen got a white vertical line through it. I looked at the digital manual that came with the camera, and it claimed that is normal. None of my other digital cameras did that. The white line didn't show up in the picture though. I am impressed with all the settings and editing capabilities this camera has. You can adjust the colors of your picture, edit them, adjust the brightness, and other things even without uploading them to your computer. I've never really used photo editing software much anyway, so maybe I don't know what I'm missing. I just thought that was very neat to be able to do all that. It also has onscreen help for making adjustments for things like low light or bright light conditions, reducing camera shake, and as I mentioned adjusting colors. I think this is another very useful feature of this camera. This camera uses digital image stabilization, which from what I know isn't quite as good as optical image stabilization. It has a rechargeable lithium ion battery, so it's pretty thin and light, fits in my purse even easier than my other digital cameras that used AA batteries. I noticed with a previous Samsung camera I owned that it started to put little white spots on pictures I took so I wound up returning it. I'm hoping this one won't develop that flaw. Samsung is one brand of digital camera Consumer Reports gives generally high marks to, so that is why I gave Samsung another chance with this camera. I will edit this review if I get any problem with it. I'd really probably give this camera 4 1/2 stars if that was an option.", "Date": "May 1, 2010"}, {"Title": "Better than SL30", "Author": "Scott Roberts", "ReviewID": "R1MXD0SRO8BPKF", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "[update edit: I initially gave this 5 stars.  Although I do not see anything wrong in my initial review text below, we have been very disappointed with it after more use.  Part of the problem may be that we also have a $189 Panasonic Lumix DMC ZS1 that it is much better in quality but over 2 times the price.  We're giving this one away and going with one $50 more, the Panasonic Lumix DMC-FP3.  I strongly recommend pre-viewing cameras in local stores and get the one that you like the most that is within your budget. Cameras in this price range may be best for young children who might break it.]The are 2 big pluses for the Samsung SL50 over the SL30:1) Wide angle lens of 27 mm verses the standard 35 mm of the SL30.2) Lithium battery pack verses the 2 AA of the SL30.The wider angle allows more people to be in a group shot. Most personal cameras are heading this way.  In tight rooms and at restaurant tables, it is a big plus.  To get pictures to look like a traditional 35 mm lens, you can zoom in a little.  Some wide angle cameras are 25 mm, which causes a little too much fish-eye if you don't zoom.  I think the 27 mm of the SL50 is the best trade-off between what the average user needs and not having too much fish-eye.  Many amateurs stand too far away from their subject and end up with as much wall and floor in their picture as people.  So 27 mm means you need to stand closer or zoom a little. Again, this is almost always a plus.The optics of the SL50 allow you to get 29% closer than the SL30 (135 mm verses 105 mm) when zooming in on long distance subjects even though the ratings are 5x verses 3x zoom (which makes it sounds like 66% more).  This is because the SL50 starts with a wider field of view.Do not be put off by the 10 MP in comparison to 12 MP.  Computer screens can't utilize more than 2 MP. It's unfortunate most cameras these days are limiting the ability to have 1 MP and 2 MP pictures and putting the default at 12 MP. Most people do not realize they need to change the settings to 2 MP so that the picture can be taken, viewed, transferred, and edited much faster.", "Date": "July 11, 2010"}, {"Title": "Very average...", "Author": "J.

Pictures taken in well-lit places look really good, the less light you have, the worse the pictures seem to get, it doesn't perform very well at all in low-light with any of the automatic settings, and I don't know enough about cameras to manually tweak them.Probably one of the better cameras in the sub-$100 price range.Pros:Small, lightweight, easily fits in a shirt or pants pocketPictures taken in daylight, or well-lit areas look greatBattery last a whileIncludes PC transfer cable and software, some cameras I've bought in the past, buying the cable was separateCons:Horrible pictures in low-light settingsNo viewfinder, screen view onlyProprietary rechargeable battery...mine's working great but eventually it'll wear out, and they aren't that cheap", "Date": "August 17, 2010"}, {"Title": "It's a good camera!", "Author": "Tahmay", "ReviewID": "R2S3N00CRXDZGZ", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I got a Panasonic for my anniversary and 3 days later lost it at a football game. I was about to go out of town and needed to get a good, yet affordable camera quick, so I purchased the Samsung. It is a good compact camera for the price.

It has good photo quality in well lighted situations but performs poorly in low-light instances.  The camera is a nice compact size and has a comfortable weight.  The LCD screen is very good, but there is no viewfinder to use as an alternative to the LCD.  The menu options are sufficient but are not that plentiful.  It is fairly annoying that in order to record videos with the camera that you must always access the menu screen to do so.  The flash is fairly bright, and will most certainly help a low-light situation if you are shooting the photo in a small area (for example a bedroom or smaller in terms of size) but the flash will not help much for a photo in a vast or open area (for example a field).  The camera works with SD memory cards, and I have personally used a 16GB SDHC card with the camera with no issues.  Most of the other features of the camera are standard on most/all digital cameras and therefore I will not discuss them, for more information about these features please check the product specifications.  The camera is a decent entry in the small, point & shoot categories.  The camera performs great in well lighted situations but does poorly in most low light situations.  If you get a good deal on this camera then it is a good purchase, and you will almost certainly be satisfied.-Matt", "Date": "January 26, 2011"}, {"Title": "not bad but", "Author": "Baris Taze", "ReviewID": "R1UI8X2L8KI8EW", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "It is under my expectation.
