Everything in the bundle works great and is very useful.Pros:- takes great photos-lots of scene settings-nice feel, easy to hold-large LCD screenCons:-when you zoom really far, it becomes a little grainy-when you are trying to take up-close, or zoomed in pics it can be very hard to focus the camera-the video quality is fine, however the microphone barely picks up any noise.  For example, I took a video of my brother and he was 3-4 ft. away and you could barely hear him on the video.

This camera has some of the best pictures i've seen. There's about 400 options once you get it up and running, have no clue what the hell i'm doing, but if you find the active or automatic setting, and make sure the flash is up no matter what (obviously not outside looking at the sun, for example), you will be amazed.  Bought this as my fiance's x-mas gift, and was a hit.  To give you an idea, a guy I work with took the same route and bought his wife a camera for x-mas.  The only difference between our 16mp cameras is that his lenses come off, has complete manual override, etc. (SLR camera vs. my SLR-esque camera).  Oh, and by the way, his camera costs $1200 and came with classes for instruction on how to use the thing.  To date, his wife only has used it in the classes.  And to date, i've made a house payment, bought the camera, and took a vacation with the camera for the same money.

So if the factory lens gets a scratch, one will have to find an entire new lens assembly on ebay (for the time being they're available), and hope someone locally knows how to install it.Besides that, however, the GE Power Pro X500 is hard to beat for the money --- ESPECIALLY when buy the packaged kit with the soft case, memory card, tripod and cleaning stuff --- yes, mighty hard to beat indeed!", "Date": "November 10, 2012"}, {"Title": "Built for NASA  and me!", "Author": "James White", "ReviewID": "R2RBYSZO9DWZ7A", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "You'll be hard-pressed to find a more inept picture-taker than me.
