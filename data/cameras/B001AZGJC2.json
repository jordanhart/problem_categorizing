Don't know why. I bought 2 of them last week (for myself + gift) and I tested both. I bought them on tigerDirect for $70. I also posted my review there.For the PROS: it uses SD but you have to buy one (max 4GB) and uses AA. The LCD is very large 3\" but that's not all good since it eats the batteries quick (I suggest rechargeables). There are also a lot of features that I don't use. Don't know if this is a pro or con!The main CONS are in video. I thought I could use it as a digital camcorder (35 min of 640x480 video on a 2GB card), but two things were not working on both the cameras that I bought: zooming does NOT work while capturing video. You have to set it up before capturing as you do with single shots! There is also a terrible background noise with the recorded sound, something like tac-tac-tac. After all, it's a camera not a camcorder!Update on Dec 23, 2010: The camera is still working flawlessly... and still consuming a lot of batteries too!", "Date": "May 12, 2009"}, {"Title": "Good While It Lasted", "Author": "TawnTawn", "ReviewID": "R5SHSPF0K2GAD", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "This camera totally quit working after less than 6 months of use.

In my case, it was a purchase at a brick and mortar store in my area.  I'd been wanting to upgrade from a digital camera I had purchased several years ago, one that topped out at approximately 2 Megapixels.  Not that there was anything wrong with that old camera, but I had purchased it back when digital cameras were far more expensive, and finding a camera with anything more than 2 Megapixels back then would have cost me an arm and a leg, rather than a single appendage. ;-)I made my purchase of this new camera shortly after Black Friday, and had just missed sales on digital cameras at a couple of retailers, Target and Amazon included.  As it turned out though, what I missed on one hand seemed to be made up for with savings on this model.Polaroid is a brand I've known most of my life.  When I was far younger, the art of taking pictures was a choice between Polaroid's instant technology or Kodak's more traditional film technology.  With Kodak's films you had to wait to get your film developed before you'd be able to tell whether or not you'd gotten a good picture.  Even with Polaroid's quick developing film technology you were left waiting a few minutes to see the completely developed photograph and unless you had very cooperative subjects you could wind up flubbing a picture because someone moved, was frowning, wasn't smiling, or was joking around in some way that made the picture less than perfect.Obviously digital camera technology has now long since eliminated much of the hassle of getting good pictures.  With most modern digital cameras there's a nice LCD window to see the results of the picture you've just snapped, and on many digital cameras -- such as the Polaroid i1035 -- there's no longer a typical viewfinder to be used to line up and frame the picture.  Instead you simply see the image on the LCD display and what you see there is what you'll wind up when the shutter is opened and closed.  A minor drawback to this approach is that by using the LCD display in this manner you use up battery life somewhat quicker, so you are well advised to use higher quality batteries and keep spares handy.The Polaroid i1035 features a 'large 3.0 inch' LCD display (Polaroids words for the display quoted).  It is a very reasonable size, and offers a very nice display for showing off and previewing the pictures you take with the camera.The Polaroid i1035 includes support for use of an SD memory card.  By using a memory card of up to 4GB (4 Gigabytes) the number of pictures that can be taken will likely far exceed the life of the batteries, though, of course, the batteries can be replaced repeatedly while new pictures are taken and added to any memory card that might be installed in the camera.  Note that the internal camera memory is fairly small at 32MB (32 Megabytes).  If a memory card is not installed and/or the photo resolution and quality settings are not changed from the defaults and 'dialed down' the number of pictures that could be taken before the camera would be considered full will be fairly low.Worse on battery life and memory life, but a problem for virtually any digital camera that supports the feature, is that the Polaroid i1035 also supports taking live action video.  Again, without using an installed memory card, the amount of video that can be taken is severely restricted.  On the other hand, 2GB SD memory cards can be purchased at fairly low prices, so it really isn't expensive to give this camera a fairly roomy storage area to work with.I mention a few detractions in the title of the review.  Hopefully readers of this review can tolerate a little of my nit-picking and perfectionism.One of the first complaints I have is in regards to the Quick Start Guide.  Understand that I'm a guy.  As with most guys that means that I'm not very likely to read through a complete manual.  A quick start guide is just what I'm looking for, and really, I'm hopeful and optimistic that I don't even need that.  I expect and hope that I could simply pick up the electronic device and start making use of it without reading anything at all, and in most cases, at least for well developed products, that seems to work pretty well.  In the case of this camera, not quite as nice as that.  No, this camera isn't that difficult to use, but it works a little differently than the camera I used to use, and taking the time to read through the Quick Start Guide is advisable.  Unfortunatley the Quick Start Guide isn't as convenient as it should be. In order to have the guide fit nicely in the box that the camera, cable, batteries, software disc and manual all come in the guide is folded up from a larger size down to approximately 5\" by 5\".  I wouldn't mind that at all if the guide folded out in a simple booklet fashion, but instead the guide folds out, then out again to a length (or would it be height) of approximately 20\".  Once it's folded out to that height it is opened (unfolded) down the length (or height) and then unfolded down the height again.  When all is said and done you have a piece of paper that is nearly poster size, with print that isn't all that big, and multiple diagrams shown on both sides of the paper (or poster).  Not exactly what I would call convenient or user friendly.Note also that this camera is a bit of heavy weight.  No, it's not that heavy, but it's also not all that light.  Compared to the camera I used to use, well, it's probably very similar.  Compared to a device like my Cell Phone (Samsung BlackJack II) it's more like a brick.  Compared to an iPod Touch, well, it seems to be the heavier of the two.  That could be just my imagination, but certainly there are other digital cameras on the market that are smaller and lighter.  No, this camera isn't that big, but it's not that small either.  At roughly 1\" thick, and approximately 4\" wide, and nearly 2.5\" tall, it's a little smaller (width wise) than an iPod Touch, but not by much.Perhaps the final irritant for me is that a lot of the metal on the housing for this camera seems to have been chosen simply because it attracts finger prints.  No, I'm not that picky, but parts of the case are covered with material that doesn't show finger prints that well, while other parts -- most importantly parts that are regularly touched -- show prints very easily.Those complaints aside, this is a full featured digital camera.  It includes 3X optical zoom, and 4X digital zoom.  It also offers Anti-shake image stabilization, face tracking 'for perfect faces in your pictures', 'smile & blink detection' and 'red-eye removal'.  (Basically the camera uses artificial intelligence and image recognition to help improve your photo taking skills).  It also supports Panoramic stitching which lets you 'stitch' together a series of photos into a larger panoramic photo.  For the cost, it's about as good as anyone could ask for, my minor nits aside.If you're shopping for a digital camera and see this model available at a fair price, I would say you've found a good deal.  Definitely give it a good look.", "Date": "December 13, 2008"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": null, "Features": null, "Name": null, "ImgURL": null, "ProductID": "B001AZGJC2"}}
