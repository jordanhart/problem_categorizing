{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Good, Affordable Security System", "Author": "atlas1059", "ReviewID": "R238T6V7M1MIEW", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Overall, the Samsung SDE-5001 security system (which works with these cameras) is a good, affordable do-it-yourself system. I bought the main system from Costso and found these additional cameras (with nifty audio feature) on Amazon for almost the same price as on the Samsung website. I prefer purchasing product directly from Amazon as I trust them more than other websites ... even the Samsung website. The system is super-easy to install so it was not a problem.  At $140+ a camera, if one gets broken or damaged, replacement is a breeze.UPDATE (January 13, 2013)It's been a little over 6 months since I installed all my Samsung cameras and I noticed a little bit of rust starting to form on the base (not camera) area where the screws attach to the roof. The screws, which came with the unit are also starting to rust.  I'm not overly worried because the camera itself still looks to be in fine condition but it's just the base (which screws into the camera) that's showing wear and tear.  I would say that since May 2012, we've had perhaps 20 days of rain / damp conditions. The cameras are under a roof line so it only gets wet if the wind blows the rain underneath. I'm a little disappointed in the rust but still happy with the system in general.", "Date": "May 25, 2012"}, {"Title": "Water affects camera", "Author": "Chris", "ReviewID": "R3JPR93P3R25A3", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I have 10+ of these cameras installed outside our house, mostly attached under the soffit in the corners of the exterior.  But there is one area (under our deck) which has caused (2) cameras to completely die.  As many know about this Samsung system, I have to get another replacement as they are proprietary, but will take the necessary precautions to insulate against any water touching the connection and camera itself.  Besides this, the camera works well at night and the audio sounds perfect as well.", "Date": "November 2, 2013"}, {"Title": "Audio \"chugging\"", "Author": "Nancy M.", "ReviewID": "R31UKQBSY98N77", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "Bought two 1006Rs.  First camera has awful \"chugging\" sound over audio channel making the camera unusable.  Picture OK.Second 1006R using same cable had softer \"chugging\" sound ...could make out some sounds but conversation distorted.I tried switching cables and ports but second 1006R failed completely.  I spent time trying to identify a configuration or cable problem without success.  Two for two bad products are rare so I assumed I had something amiss configuration or cable wise but was unable to find or resolve any other issues.Update to 1006R review...got second camera to have working audio. I didn't do anything. Chugging sound now a steading fan noise which could be a computer fan. I will have to go out to the site (130 miles) and see if I placed the camera too close to a fan. With a steady background fan noise the audio is understandable", "Date": "May 23, 2013"}, {"Title": "Less than a year of installation - Water enters camera", "Author": "Jason A Lee", "ReviewID": "R36PMXQM3ZJOD3", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I ordered this producted on 10/16/11 and I didnt get a chance to install the product till summer of 2012.

The detail they show for both day and night use is excellant.  They are very easy to set up,I can even do it!  They use cat 5 cables instead of being hard wired.  They have connection at the camera itself so they can be moved without fishing the cat 5 cable back to the control until.
