{"Reviews": [{"Title": "The most refined APSC DSLR", "Author": "Christopher A.", "ReviewID": "RKF8TV8AJ07O6", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "To begin with I have to say this camera can't be fully enjoyed just by looking at it from the pictures here. I want to capture what it's like to hold and to have this camera in this review, not just it's specs or performance(there are plenty of reviews about that). It has enough class and style to set it's owner apart from the crowd. The sheer craftsmanship of the K-3 and attention to detail is astounding. From the placement to the buttons, to the quality of every switch and wheel, it performs beautifully. The shutter is so quite, amazingly so. Even in a church setting it doesn't attract attention.I've had other cameras, even vintage SLR's from the film days. But I have had so many compliments about this one just from its appearance. The silver finish roots it in a day and age of the past but embraces the modern world of DSLR's in a way that is a fine compliment to the aspirations of the makers of film cameras of old. Back then image quality had so much to do with the film you would use, not just the megapixel count of your sensor. The results were cameras that were crafted to reward the photographer and make the art of photography a joy and a skill that could be sharpened.My only concern before buying this camera was it's size. I'm 6'6 and my hands are very large. From the base of my palm to the tip of my middle finger is 8 1/2inches. But using the battery grip for this camera helps tremendously, And even without the extra battery grip connected the main grip is so deep there really is no problem holiding the camera comfortably.I firmly believe this camera could be used on a professional level. Maybe bot for NBA games or every sport. But events like weddings or other fine portraiture are perfectly achievable. As well as many other avenues of commercial work. This camera has all the build,the looks, and definitely the performance to get any job done.", "Date": "January 22, 2014"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": null, "Features": null, "Name": null, "ImgURL": null, "ProductID": "B00GT1MI68"}}
