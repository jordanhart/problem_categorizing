I bought this recently and it arrived quickly as promised. I was a little bummed that the 18-55mm lens was not weather sealed like the camera (it kind of makes the weather sealing of the camera pointless unless I buy a new lens), but all in all, this kit was a great value.Canon and Nikon are by and large the \"top dogs\" in this industry. Pentax has always been a step-sibling of sorts with Sony, Samsun, Sigma, etc. chasing behind. While Canon and Nikon do make fantastic cameras, I believe Pentax is setting itself apart in the entry level market. The K30 is evidence of that, providing much more value to the end user. I would recommend this camera and/or kit to anyone looking to buy an entry level DSLR.", "Date": "December 18, 2013"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": "$593.59", "Features": "16.3Mp APS-C CMOS Image Sensor\nFull 1080p30 HD Video h.264 Compression\nPRIME M Processing Optimized for Video\nAdvanced SAFOX IXi+ Autofocus\nLarge Wide Angle Viewable 3.0\" LCD", "Name": "Pentax K30 Digital Camera with 18-55mm AL Lens Kit (Black) + 32GB SDHC Class 10 Memory Card + Extended Life Battery + External Rapid Travel Quick-Charger + USB Card Reader + Memory Card Wallet + Shock Proof Deluxe Case + 3 Piece Professional Filter Kit + Super Wide Angle Lens + 2x Telephoto Lens + Professional Full Size Tripod + Accessory Saver Bundle!", "ImgURL": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51cHdt9%2BOLL._SY300_.jpg", "ProductID": "B0091IK7WI"}}
