This is by far the BEST camera I have ever owned. Right out of the box with 2 extra batteries, I shot 997 photos at a toy run event and only 6 did not come out sharp or incorrectly exposed. I also shot 6 HD video's and every one is terrific. two of these and you would be able to tackle most jobs. (I always bring 2 or more camera's on any shoot) And for $500 this was a bargain!", "Date": "December 21, 2012"}, {"Title": "GREAT Camera Package", "Author": "DandyDan", "ReviewID": "R3FXAXGS2TBLQE", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Great camera, everything it was supposed to do, it does and even more...

Ashbaugh", "ReviewID": "RJ9S7RN1K0WO4", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I really like this camera. The lens is excellent and the feature set includes nearly everything I wanted. The only thing I would like added to it is a GPS option, but since I've never had one in a camera before I don't really miss it.I've been experimenting with the camera before taking it on a trip to New Zealand. I've had moderately high-end cameras in the past, and this is my favorite so far. The lens has a remarkable 25-600mm range (35mm equivalent) at f/2.8 for the entire range. The picture is clear and both the rear display and the electronic viewfinder show it brightly.I've tested several shooting modes so far, including still photos with exposure options, video, high-speed video, and burst-mode photography. They've all worked as expected. I'm now experimenting with exposure options.The package of items the camera came with is very useful. The case is by Vivitar, and holds everything easily. Two extra batteries ensure having power. The Travel Charger can be used in the car or with 120-240V AC. The SD card has plenty of capacity (even though I purchased another just to be certain when I travel). The only item that's not very useful is the tripod - it's rather light so I would not trust it. I'll use my gorilla grip tripod, instead. The vendor, Sunset Electronics, was extremely responsive when I discovered an error. The Travel Charger that came with the package was for a Nikon, and the USB-SD card adapter did not work. When I contacted them, Sunset Electronics immediately sent out the correct replacement items. There was no charge and they did not request return of the faulty ones. I would buy from them again without hesitation.If anything else comes up as I test it further, I'll add to this review.", "Date": "January 18, 2014"}, {"Title": "The One I always Wanted", "Author": "Barbara Pringle", "ReviewID": "R1F8ELWQZAMROT", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I have had a couple of friends tell me the Panasonic Lumix FZ200 is the Best camera they have owned, the one friend showed me hers and she said she Loves it.

Great Package", "Author": "Bret Legg", "ReviewID": "R4BFSWAR23K7C", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I bought this camera for my wife, who wanted to take high quality pictures without the hassle of changing out lenses on a DSLR.  It's got a great 26X zoom.  Though this is not as powerful as some zooms out there, the sweet thing about this lens is that it keeps a 2.8 f-stop throughout the entire range of the zoom, making it a much faster lens than many of the others.  The package gives you two extra batteries, so you'll never run out of juice.  The case that comes in the package is a little small and not very thick.  I will probably replace it.  All in all, I'm very pleased with this purchase.", "Date": "February 11, 2014"}, {"Title": "Great Camera", "Author": "elfie411", "ReviewID": "RNDRCP96B6ZJS", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This camera is what I expected.

I would definitely buy it again. The shipping was very fast and everything that was mentioned was included. Just an FYI the additional products are NOT authentic Panasonic products, including the spare batteries. They are by a brand called X-it Photo.
