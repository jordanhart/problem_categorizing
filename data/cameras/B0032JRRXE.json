{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Excellent, High Quality Camera for the Price with One Exception", "Author": "Daddy Bear", "ReviewID": "RUR69IPJ2NCNL", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Just got this brand new camera.  I replaced our Casio, which was one of the most impressive digital cameras I have ever owned (had it for only 14 months).  The reason for the replacement, my family loses cameras... a lot.. and this one went bye bye somewhere.  The Casio had great features, a nice touch screen, a great zoom, good shutter speed for sporting events, and time between photos was great for the photo quality.  It had one flaw, its inability to take night photos and the movies even in natural light were only okay.  There were a ton of options, which for a standard user could be overwhelming.Now to the PowerShot.  This camera, sometimes will look grainy on the viewfinder until the actual photo itself is taken, but when the photo is taken... perfection.  No matter the differences in light and shadows in a picture, the PowerShot somehow nicely accommodates for this.  While the standard zoom is 4X, it can go to 10x, and with the shutter and flash, it still takes much better than most from beyond its standard range.  PIctures at night with or without flash is absolutely incredible and movies are easy to take and upload.  The features are plenty, but not overly complex.  This means a standard user cannot get into trouble, but the highly discerning user might want more.  There are other 10 and 12 MP cameras out there, and many have poor picture quality, which for me makes no sense... having a high quality image of a bad shot is an oxymoron.  You don't have to worry with this camera.Here is the one downside... time between shots.  If you are looking for a camera to hold down the shutter and take pictures in multiples in rapid fire, this might not be the camera for you.  While a faster memory card will help issue, you will not be able to rattle off 5 shots in 10 seconds during your kid's soccer game.  If you want to have 2 or 3 perfect shots in that 10 seconds, this is the camera for you.  It doesn't have a touch screen either, but with the Casio, this sometimes got in the way during viewing or taking shots.Summarizing... This camera is easy to use, not confusing, has a great smart mode, and has yet to take a poor picture in any light condition.  If you can't take a good picture on your current camera, you will be able to on this one.  The movie mode is very easy, but should be used in good light either indoors or out.  It does zoom during the movie, which I understand isn't common, and the microphone is extremely sensitive... which means if you fumble around, it will record the fumbling noise, but that is very hard to avoid on any camera.  It is lightweight, but substantial enough to hold comfortably.  All in all, this is a camera any family would be happy to have.", "Date": "May 1, 2010"}, {"Title": "Extremely easy to use.

Wagner", "ReviewID": "R2OT9HN7VKXAUE", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "My Canon S410 Powershot gave up the ghost, even after a trip back to Canon for repairs ($100, ouch). I was tired of not having a camera and this one crossed my path at the right time and I bought it after debating for months which camera to go with.This is MUCH lighter than my Canon S410, and far sleeker -- all the knobs and buttons and whatnot are smooth and out of the way. It won't snag on things like the boxy S410 tended to do. This camera is as light as a plastic disposable camera. I remember my first digital camera back in 1999 which weighed a pound and then some.The LCD screen is ENORMOUS compared to my old camera(s). It takes up almost the entire back of the camera body. Amazing. The controls are scrunched together compared to the S410 controls. Having had the S410 I was familiar with the Canon layout and the way the camera works, which was nice.An earlier review mentioned that the startup time and the time between shots was long -- I didn't find that to be the case. It powers up almost instantly, and even taking photos at the largest image size the time between shots is only a second or two. My first digital camera would tend to \"submarine\" for six or seven seconds between shots!Overall I'm VERY, VERY happy to have a camera that works again, and the cost wasn't all that much, like half of what I paid five years ago for the S410. Half the cost, half the weight... I still daydream about getting a \"real\" camera, a digital SLR (DSLR) with a nice heavy L-series prime lens... but it wouldn't fit in my pocket, would it?Don't hesitate -- this is a beautiful little device, thoughtfully designed and nicely manufactured. If you're traveling or if you're a parent (or both) you know you simply cannot take too many photos. I bought a 4GB card for this, one of those little big-as-your-thumbnail chips, and even at the highest resolution the photos are about 2MB apiece, so you can shoot a lot of photos and never run out of space. Included with the camera was a cable to attach to a television, which I thought was a neat idea. I'll have to play with that sometime.My only caveat would be based on my experience having sent my S410 in for repair to Canon -- for $100 the repair didn't last long at all, I wonder if they just sent me a refurbished unit they had. Anyway, don't DROP your camera and you won't have to send it in to be repaired.", "Date": "May 28, 2010"}, {"Title": "Extremely easy to use.

For those of you unfamiliar with the Canon line, they are targeted at users who value simplicity and ease of use.  Clearly, they are also focused on a price point that is quite low.  If you are looking for greater sophistication and higher quality (both photographic and build), there are many other choices.  However, given its mission, the A3100 succeeds.First, ease of use is well thought out.  The user is presented with icons intended to be intuitive.  However, there is a safety net for those perplexed by that approach: the software provides a running, written commentary on the purpose of the available options.  The designers have attempted to make this device as palatable and non threatening as possible.Second, even for users accustomed to more sophisticated cameras, the image quality is more than satisfactory.  When purchasing a digital camera, one should not concentrate on \"pixels\". Digital imaging is dependent upon lens quality and the processor, in this case Canon's Digic III.  I have felt that Canon's processors were among the best, for years.  However, it is fair to say that the technology has improved to such an extent that many of the major brands are competitive with one another.My primary concern and criticism is build quality; the battery and memory card door is flimsy (another review mentioned this), as is the USB port cover.  Only time will tell if this is a problem.Another review has mentioned dark images and less than satisfactory results with the zoom.  While I have not utilized the digital zoom, yet, I find the optical zoom and image stabilization to operate quite well.This is not an advanced SLR or a Leica; nor is it intended to be.  However, within the scope of its designers' intent, it performs admirably, rewarding the user with photos above \"snapshot\" quality.  For approximately $150.00, it is difficult to imagine a better performer.", "Date": "July 10, 2010"}, {"Title": "Great Camera", "Author": "Lisa Siegel", "ReviewID": "RGZYKT4I3TDOZ", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "The first digital camera that I ever bought was a Canon.  It was a PowerShot A80 that had 4.0mp and 3x digital zoom.  Since then, I have only purchased Canon brand digital cameras.  The only reason I stopped using that one was because of age.  So I bought the 7.0mp PowerShot SD750 Elph a few years ago.  Again, incredible camera.  I really liked that it had a lithium battery that was rechargeable.  That's one thing I look for in digital cameras.I bought this camera a few months ago when my SD750's battery couldn't seem to hold a charge (I had 2 different batteries for the camera).  So that's when I decided I needed to purchase a new one.  When I saw the A3100 IS, I was brought back to my first camera.  It also has choices for which type of mode you want to shoot in on the top of the camera.  It was a little hard to get used to again, but it's very easy to use.  The fact that it has 12.1 mp is definitely a plus.  The pictures I take are far superior to what my other cameras took.  I do wish that it had HD video, but I'm not complaining about it.  The video feature (which I used often) is great.  I really like how you can now zoom in and out while filming.  My mom's old camera (a Sony) was not able to do that.  She now owns a different camera (Nikon) but it isn't as easy to use as this one is.For anyone who is like me and just likes to take pictures and/or shoot videos, I'd highly recommend this camera to you.  It's easy to use and it's pretty compact.  Sure it's not as small as the Elph cameras, but it's also not huge.  I love the face detection feature as well.

In fact, it was the high praise that made me buy it. However, it suffers from the typical problems most cameras in this price range do --slow shutter/write to disk speed and mediocre low light shooting.I shoot mostly indoors, and I was taken in by all the reviewers who said this camera does great in low light conditions. Not my experience. I keep it set to \"Auto\" mostly because I'm not a photographer who fiddles with all the settings, so I was banking on the auto feature to sort out poor lighting, but probably 30% of my indoor shots are blurry (I have a pretty steady hand) and/or over-exposed from the flash. And the time it takes to write an image to the disk (I use a high-end SanDisk Extreme III SD card)is aggravating. The pause is at least 3 seconds, which doesn't sound like a lot, but an eternity if you're trying to capture events quickly (without having to use the continuous fire mode).Also, I thought I wouldn't miss having a view finder to look through, but I was wrong. If you use this outside in bright light, the LCD is nearly useless. Taking a picture with the LCD in bright light is a crap-shoot guesstimate.Anyway, it's not the worst camera I've owned in this price range, but I'm still looking for the best in this price range, and I don't think this is it.", "Date": "September 3, 2010"}, {"Title": "excellent all around camera", "Author": "Jason Jimenez", "ReviewID": "R2UZ0Q8F1RY4TZ", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I have to admit I am a big fan of Canon cameras.

Oertel \"Goetz von Berlichingen\"", "ReviewID": "R227CYKAV6WJAE", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "This camera promised superior resolution, more flexible photography, and easier handling.  It met two of the three but failed in the most important aspect - resolution and image quality.With 9.1 MPs the A3100IS should produce superior images (monitor) and photos compared with my two older cameras with fewer pixels and no image stabilization.  Instead, the A31OOIS produces a dull and comparatively fuzzy image on the monitor that improves only slightly as one prepares to take a photo.  In both ways, the image has two to three times less resolution than the older cameras with their fewer pixels.  Further, the colors are subdued - somewhere between true color and a yellowish \"black-white\" image.  That represents a big step backward from earlier models and is certainly not an upgrade in any sense.Image stabilization can be nice - but it's next to useless when the image and photo are inferior to begin with.The camera offers an outstanding array of features and a superbly \"human engineered\" set of controls that quickly bring order to what might otherwise be an overwhelmingly large set of features and capabilities.  Alas, again, the poor imaging performance renders these features next to useless and reduces the fun of exploring their full range.  Finally, in regard to easier handling, the amazingly nice and compact size of the camera makes it easy to be ready to shoot.When my A3100IS arrived with this flaw, I returned it to Amazon for an exchange.  Alas, the second A3100IS was hardly better than the first.  That suggests a design flaw in optics or, more likely, the detector array.  In fact, it is not unusual for manufacturers to deliver arrays with widely variable quality.  Sometimes the quality is poor in a few units only, sometimes an entire production run may be flawed.  That may be what happened to Canon with this model.For the record, I returned the second A3100IS to Amazon for credit - not for exchange.  I still want this camera but will wait some months or a year until they can ship units that reliably produce the kind of experience I expect from this model - which should have rated five stars.Although design, flexibility, and ease of handling do deserve five stars, the resolution and color performance, sadly, are unacceptable and rate the minimum - one star - which is also my overall rating for this product - for now, at least.", "Date": "September 2, 2010"}, {"Title": "Great, Fun little pocket camera that delivers great photos...", "Author": "S.

The A3100 is much more easy to take in focus pictures compared to the cell phone camera I had been using (Venus.) I was surprised at how well the pictures came out. The camera starts up fast with a choice of sounds and images. The computer set up on my Mac (eMac Tiger) was simple and fast. The instructions were easy to follow. I have large hands and this camera is easy to use the controls. The zoom works great. I tried various settings and everything came out well. In direct sunlight it can be hard to see what you are pointing at; but with auto focus you can zero in on the image area you want and the camera gives off two quick beeps to tell you that selected area is in focus. I have had a lot of fun with this camera. I used to use a Minolta SLR film camera and that Venus cell phone camera. The software works great for me on my Mac and Zino HD (PC.). I expect to use it on Debian GNU/Linux too; but I have not tried it yet with that operating system. The camera has a good feel. I carry it in my front vest pocket or shirt pocket; pull it out and easily take some quick pictures. I ordered another power pack and 2GB memory card. The battery charged up in one hour and a half; just as what was written in the operating manual. There is a place to screw the camera onto an tripod too (underneath.) I am really surprised that is such a fun and easy to use camera. When I turn on my camera the lens expands outward. I am happy with this camera. I don't have any negative things to write yet.Now that I have had this camera for a long time I have more to write about it. I have dropped it a few times on hard ground. This caused the zoom function to stop working till I kept taking the battery out and tapped the sides of the camera. Then it only took doing this a few times and the zoom was back to working normal. I discovered that the camera software will only work with my PC if I have less than 1000 pictures on the camera. I had more than than number of pictures and the cable would not transfer pictures as the computer said something like no camera was attached or not recognized. So I just deleted the 4000 pictures which I already had copies on my PC and then the software with the PC and camera worked fine again. So the camera seems pretty durable considering I dropped it from waist height onto the ground a few times. I have not had any other trouble with it. I use the self-timer regularly to take shots of my dog and myself. I've had this camera out in the windy rain storms and it got wet; but I did try to keep it dry. It has not had any problems with that either. I take the camera with me every where I go in my waist pack.

First, it is truly effortless to take great pictures with this little gem. And unlike some digitals I've had in the past, this one interfaces seamlessly with iPhoto on my Mac. I just plug it in and have my pictures uploaded in seconds - literally. I never even had to load Canon's software, although I think that is due to the Mac more than to the camera. The camera is small and light, but not so small that it's hard to use. The buttons are easy to reach and clearly marked. I just slip the 3100 into my pocket and go.

The A3100 is at the higher end of the line featuring image stabilization and a slim rechargeable battery that allows for a compact body.It's features are pretty much what the more expensive SD series offered 2 years ago. However, their metal heft and feel are absent. I'm not sure how this affects durability, but the buttons are definitely less satisfying to press. Fortunately the lighter weight and slightly upturned grip make the A3100 easier to hold than the latest SD and Elph series which--for better or worse--have reverted to the soap bar shapes of old.SMART AUTO (only red icon on the mode dial) is the prescribed shooting mode for basic users, and makes 'point-and-shoot' as fool-proof as possible. Another convenience is the dedicated PLAY button to review pictures or movies taken (PLAY used to be on the mode dial on older Canon compacts). Face detection--which tries to make sure people instead of the background are in focus--is built in. This includes its implementation as a self timer option that takes a picture 2 seconds after a new face (i.e. your own) enters the scene. By default, useful screen prompts are displayed at every stage of operation to guide new users. These can be turned off.While SMART AUTO lets you focus on taking pictures, it also denies you virtually all control. For photographers who want to keep things simple, this is a good thing, but I'm disappointed that in this mode you have to give up the nice widescreen 16:9 aspect ratio, and the ability to select a smaller image size--you must shoot at the full 12 megapixels. The latter means many users of this camera will likely be emailing you huge images that are 5MB+ each. Zooming felt sluggish and was compounded by my struggle with the thumb-operated zoom control located on the back of the camera. I'm used to a toggle on the front of the camera operated by my index finger.People who just want to point and shoot will appreciate this camera. Photographers who want a bit more control have at their disposal many of the standard features we have come to expect: scenes, artistic effects, movie mode, ISO/exposure compensation, force flash off, image size, etc. The A3100 boasts many capabilities, but compared to other cameras costing even $50 more, the compromised handling makes it hard to get the most out of this camera, and a budding amateur may well grow weary of its limitations.", "Date": "June 20, 2011"}, {"Title": "Great little camera", "Author": "Kara L.

Unlike most low end digital cameras, this A3100IS has a real Optical Image Stabilizer. It does not use AA batteries, which IMHO is a good thing. It makes the camera small and stylish. And it improves the flash charge time too. It has a set of shooting modes ranging from dumbest Simple mode with no user option to Auto mode with limited user options to P mode with lots of user options. It also has many scene modes to fit your needs.I did not expect much on image quality from this cheap camera. As I also bought myself a new point-n-shoot camera, which is 5x more expensive, I did some test shots and expected my bigger camera blew this A3100IS away. But I was wrong!Under good light conditions, A3100IS's image quality is surprisingly good. The color is vivid and the image is sharp. While my more expensive camera can produce corner-to-corner sharpness, A3100IS's center area is actually sharper! It has some Barrel Distortion and Purple Fringing. But they are not serious at all. Most likely, you will not even notice them.It is a little weird that your finger has to cross the mode dial to push the shutter button. But it should not be a problem if someone uses this camera exclusively. The build quality is a little questionable. The camera body was not aligned perfectly like those more expensive ones. I found a dirty spot on lens when I first turned it on. (From the packaging, I am sure it is brand new and not a customer return.) A piece of Canon lens tissue took care of it in no time.

However, it is SUPER SLOW to take the next picture. If this is for an adult who has babies, toddlers or young children...it'd be best you spend the money on a better camera. I'm not a photographer so I just care about the easy settings and to point and shoot, but now I wished I would have coughed up another $200 for a better compact camera. The problem is that the higher MP, the more space in my computer and external hard-drive they take up. Keeping it from 8-12 mp, seems reasonable, but there isn't anything out there that's reasonably priced. The newer digital cameras are coming out with 16MP. That's too much for me. Consumer reports has the Canon PowerShot S95 as one of the top 3 digital cameras with 10mp and from the amazon reviews, it looks like most are happy with it. I just can't see myself paying $381.00!!!  For now I am stuck with this camera, bc it's what I can afford.NOTE: It seems as soon as consumer reports says \"X\" is a great camera, people buy, stock is depleted, prices go up and then a new batch of the same model is made, but that newer batch doesn't do as well technically as the first batch.

I'm not a photographer at all. I do love post-processing, though, and so I decided that I should probably learn how to shoot pictures. After a lot of research into point-and-shoot models under $300, I decided on this one, and I'm not sorry. The pictures are crisp with good colors. The auto setting works well, and there are manual settings for ISO and white balance. The macro setting works beautifully. Turning the knob activates settings like kids/pets (fast shutter speed) and portrait (shorter depth of field? I'm not sure). I haven't tried to shoot video, but that's the last mode on the knob. There is also a setting on the knob for ultra-beginners or for children that \"locks out\" most buttons and shoots on full auto.The flash isn't very strong, but that's what I'd expect from a little camera like this. Obviously no viewfinder, which is not a problem for me. The LCD screen has adjustable brightness settings and seems durable enough.Transfer of photos is via USB, and the camera acts like a drive. No problems on my older Vista machine. I didn't install any software for the camera except maybe a driver that installed automatically.My 8 y/o dropped the camera from about two feet and it didn't seem to take any damage.

The successor, the A3300IS, seems to have significant problems so I opted for the A3100IS based on personal and professional reviews. This camera is a good value if a prospective purchaser pays less than $120 as of the date of this review.Let me quote Canon's manual:\"The LCD monitor is produced with extremely high-precision manufacturing techniques. More than 99.99% of the pixels operate to specification, but occasionally non-performing pixels may appear as bright or dark dots. This is not a malfunction and has no effect on the recorded image.\" Unfortunately, I have one of the .01% LCDs which have dead pixels. Words don't compensate for flaws in production, Canon. Regardless, I do agree that the dead pixels on the LCD don't impact the photographic image.Personally, I wanted adequate low-light performance in this camera. * Captured images with ISO 1600 aren't really usable in my opinion and should be avoided. ISO 800 produces a noticeable color shift and loss of detail so it's probably only adequate for low-light, action shots where ISO 400 isn't suitable. ** I have taken a few images of static scenes at night without the flash and constrained to ISO 400 with street lighting and leaning against a support with respectable results. The Canon A3100IS is capable of taking decent low-light shots of static scenes at F3.5 with ISO 400, but a tripod is necessary. For nighttime shots of static scenes without a flash, try F2.7-3.5, ISO 400, and a tripod. For nighttime shots with considerable action ***, naturally use a tripod in a sufficiently bright area due to perimeter lighting or a strong flash, e.g. Canon's HF-DC1, and try F2.7 with ISO 800 only as a last resort. Furthermore, expect noticeable noise, color shift, and loss of detail if you do use ISO 800. The use of a small tripod balanced on one's knee will probably work sufficiently for capturing low-light, action shots (ISO 800) while seated, but I haven't tested the possibility yet. For daytime shots, try F3.5-5.6 and ISO Auto. Physically move closer or further from the scene if necessary. If one doesn't plan to post-process images, try increasing the sharpness in the \"Custom Color\" setting since the images are a little soft using default settings. For beginning photographers, hold the camera properly, i.e. with the palm of the hand facing toward you with the thumb vertical and 90 degrees to the remaining 4 fingers pointing horizontally. Cup the 4 horizontal fingers at their tips if desired and hold the elbows of both arms next to your body. Place the camera in the area created by the vertical thumb and horizontal fingers. Lastly, to capture colors as accurately as possible, use the option to evaluate white balance judiciously. This camera is capable of producing very good quality images in the \"Program\" mode and good quality images in the \"Auto\" mode. If one post-processes the images using non-commercial or commercial software, the A3100IS can produce pictures rivaling those using the hardware processors of cameras twice as expensive. Learn to use post-processing software!If the reader wants very good low-light performance, he will likely have to spend 3x the money and buy a S95. With a bit more experience, I'll likely be satisfied with the A3100IS as I also have Canon's HF-DC1 to use when needed.UPDATE: I've posted a few images in the gallery taken with Canon's A3100IS* All low-light shots use the 2M pixel resolution** Actually, the A3100IS has better performance at ISO 800 than Panasonic's Lumix FH20. However, both cameras are basically unusable at ISO 800 without post-processing of the images. With post-processing software, e.g. the free Wavelet DeNoise plug-in for GIMP, one can produce good quality images even at ISO 800.*** Until P&S; cameras can accurately reproduce images with minimal color shift and noise at ISO 3200, users will need to use a flash when filming dynamic scenes with considerable action at night.", "Date": "August 7, 2011"}, {"Title": "Caonon powershot A3100IS", "Author": "G.

The store which I bought it from said they wouldn't take it back because the screen is crack. And I was confused I had it in the \"protective\" case. So I sent it to Canon. Where they told me this camera is not as strong as the rebel, and is not durable like cell phones, and can't go in your pocket. Then they wanted $107 to fix it. I will NEVER buy canon again or a plastic camera... I've had many digital cameras that stood the test of time. Canon tried to tell me it was a compression crack (maybe) from my front pocket or that it was put somewhere to hot. Canon, your customer service in Virginia stinks.

At first I thought maybe my expectations were unrealistic, but after spending just $15 more to replace it with a fabulous little Panasonic Lumix FH20, I now know that Canon has come up way short in this price range.The Canon is slow to start up, slow to process a picture and be ready for a second shot, horrid at taking indoor photos, and surprisingly bulky for what it offers.  Compared to the built-in camera on my Blackberry, the Blackberry wins in the quality match up! Pretty unbelievable.The navigation menus and playback took some figuring out, which I wouldn't be mentioning here but now that I have breezed through the Lumix menus without the manual I can see this is another major flaw of the Canon Powershot. It also does not come with a memory card so figure that into the price.One final note... I like a good, sharp, well balanced photo. I have a digital SLR that I love, so this Canon Powershot (now Panasonic Lumix) was intended for every-day toting around.
