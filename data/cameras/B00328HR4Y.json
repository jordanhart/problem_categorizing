{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Sony cameras for life!", "Author": "KD", "ReviewID": "R2K698QGRIHK6B", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I wasn't sure about taking the plunge, but I am so glad that I did!  I did 6 months of extensive research for this camera, as I was scared that nothing could replace my old Sony.  Almost 5 years ago, we purchased a Sony Super Steady Shot (5.1 mega pixels, was over $500 at the time) when we had our 1st baby.  Sticker shock aside, I have no regrets purchasing that camera, as it has given me professional quality pictures of my family that I treasure.  Fast forward 4 years, now I have 2 very active little boys and the old camera is showing its age.  The shutter speed is seriously lagging and the old camera just can't keep up with our busy boys.Enter the DSC W330.  My husband purchased this camera for me for Mother's Day and received a free case and memory card with it!  I have been talking for years about how I needed a small point and shoot for my purse, but thought nothing could be as good as my bulky Steady Shot.  In fact, for the first few weeks of owning this camera, I carried both in my purse, afraid that I was going to miss a moment.  I was afraid that a $150 camera could not possibly compare to my beloved Steady Shot.  Not the case.  With the DSC W330, I get clear, beautiful photos and 99% of the time the camera is on easy mode.  My kids move around quickly and I still get amazing shots of them.  Not one time have I thought the shutter speed was slow or that the smile finder was not good quality.My only complaint is the volume on the videos.  To watch a video and hear it very clearly, I have to plug it into the TV and turn the TV volume way up.  For the pictures this delivers, it is a quirk I can live with.If you want a professional camera with no plastic parts, I highly doubt you will find that for the $150 range.  If you want a small, compact camera that takes fast, high quality pictures, take the plunge!  My old camera sits on a shelf in the kitchen, officially retired.  That says a lot!  If you are in doubt, give the DSC W330 a chance, you will not regret it!", "Date": "May 31, 2010"}, {"Title": "Fabulous Camera!!!", "Author": "Debbie west chester PA", "ReviewID": "R226FLQYM8UQ8X", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I can't say enough about this camera.

The 14.1 mega pixels let us blow up pictures of our baby and still keeps it clear.The only reason i gave it a 4 star and not a five is because the auto smile shutter is not as accurate as a samsung we purchased and the menu features are not as intutive as those on some other cameras. Also the battery has to be removed for charging and one has to purchase a charger from sony if you dont decide to remove the battery. i think the charger needs to come with it.I like the fact that it uses a SD card and has other options.The LCD screen is really nice and big compared to other cameras.Has great pictures even in low light.Other than that it is a great point and shoot and one of the best we had. I recently purchased a samsung for my mother in law but i think this is better.Also Amazon got me a better deal than sony direct and even shipped a lot faster full marks to you amazon thats why we are loyal.Cheers and good luck on the camera.", "Date": "April 3, 2010"}, {"Title": "Perfect for the price.", "Author": "Rob", "ReviewID": "RN8SIZPEQBWX0", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I purchased this camera as a gift for my younger sibling and was shocked at how well it performed from a beginner's point of view. I was pleasantly surprised to see the camera recorded video (albeit SD) since there was no mention of it on Amazon or Sony Style. I have the Sony DSC-HX5V 10.2MP CMOS Digital Camera with 10x Wide Angle Zoom with Optical Steady Shot Image Stabilization and 3.0 inch LCD on pre-order for myself and can't imagine how impressive the image quality will be since I don't see a point and shoot getting much better than this Sony DSC-W330 from a technical standpoint.", "Date": "February 17, 2010"}, {"Title": "Great camera for the price and compact!", "Author": "Ann", "ReviewID": "R3HXCUEQY2FMY6", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I went by the ratings and also word of mouth before buying this camera and I actually bought 2 cameras... one Panasonic Lumix 12 MP and this Sony 14.1 MP.  Upon first site, the Panasonic appears to be built better.  The buttons were larger and the camera was a little heavier.  I thought, for sure, I'd keep the Panasonic.  Well, after trying both of them simultaneously the Sony took better pictures.  The Sony has a Carl Zeiss lense which is a very good lense.  Of course, all cameras have brightness adjustments, etc, but the Sony knew when to let more light in when there was not enough light (great for dim light pics). I'm sure the Panasonic could do the same if you want to keep adjusting the lighting, but I want a camera that is going to take great pics with pointing and shooting and this camera does just that.  The reason the imaging takes longer to see clearly on the LCD when you go back to view pics, I would assume, is because it is a 14.1 Mega Pixel (a lot of information) at a great price so it takes a 1/4 sec to focus the pic in clearly!  I don't mind it.  I'd rather have great pics when transporting them onto a computer, viewing them on the computer or TV or printing them.  Also, when you go into a photo editor, the clarity is scary. You can see every little detail. If you want to spend another $30 there's also the Sony W350, which will allow for viewing high def videos on your high def TV, but I viewed a video I took with the W330 and the clarity is still great.", "Date": "April 6, 2010"}, {"Title": "Pros and Cons", "Author": "Myra Binnicker", "ReviewID": "R1IOH8NE8XTWP3", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I picked this camera up for $80 at a national chain store, in their electronics center.Pros:The 14.1 MP takes very crisp and clear shots. The camera is quite thin, and slides right into a front or back jeans pocket (although I am sure you should be careful when doing this). They come in a variety of nice colors. The menus are simple to navigate. The battery life is above the average of my last few digital cameras. There are some cool options for the focus types. There is a beach focus that really makes the blues in the water pop. It works nicely for shots with a lot of blue open sky behind them as well. It picks up great detail, and is easy to use. With the right focus selected, it even does quiet well in low light conditions. I am very, very happy with the photos that I have taken with this camera. You can use either an SD or a Duo memory card in the same slot.Cons:They only use N type lithium rechargeable, so if you run out of batteries at the beach, there is no running into the gas station to grab spares. The USB port is a nonstandard size, but if you have an SD card slot on your computer, that is not a huge deal. The on screen crop is a bit complicated to figure out.Wrap Up:If you are responsible with the mini USB cable, and plan ahead where batteries and chargers are concerned, this is an awesome little camera. The quality of photos makes up for the inconveniences of not having more standard parts.Update:I have had this camera for about a year now. I have found that due to its slim size, I tend to have it in my pocket more often, resulting in fewer missed photo opportunities. I started out with the Duo card, but found it was easier to deal with the SD. The SD made for simple transfers, since I did not have to worry with finding the single USB cable that worked with it. I have found myself wishing that it had a little bit more reach with the zoom, but I am still very happy with my purchase.", "Date": "July 6, 2010"}, {"Title": "Great Camera, Great Price", "Author": "Gwyn Page", "ReviewID": "R155QTWXNAK8EH", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Years and years ago I purchased a Sony Cyber-Shot (one of the first at 4.0 MP!) and LOVED it!  It served me well all these years until it became too bulky for me to cary around and bring with me.  I wasn't using it so I gave it to a family member about a year ago who didn't have any digital camera and she loves it!For a little more than a year I've been searching and trying out various cameras and had not found one that could live up to how the old Sony Cyber-Shot made me feel... until I found this one!  Buying this camera has been like buying that first one so many years ago; I'm excited to take beautiful pictures and have instant access to them.  The quality blows me away and the new intuitive features are amazing.

I went home for a week and had two graduations and a wedding to go to. After trying to take pictures at the first graduation I realized quickly I would need a new camera that night.The picture quality is excellent! I love the steady shot and the shutter speed has been able to take great pictures of family and friends in motion. I was originally hoping for a camera that took batteries, I can carry around AA's easily and was worried that the battery would be a hassel. The battery life has worked wonderful (and believe me I used this camera a lot in the past week). It also takes a relatively short amount of time to charge which is nice.The camera does take a few seconds to load a picture to view it, which can be very annoying when looking at more than a few pictures. Video quality is good and easy to use but the sound is quiet(not a big deal to me since my last camera didn't do sound). It also makes a lot of sound while taking pictures which can be annoying if you are trying to be quiet (like when the bride walks down the asile). I also have a little difficulty opening up the AVI output and battery area.Overall this camera did great. It's slim enough that I could hide it in my dress at a wedding, the pictures were wonderful, and the battery life was great. After three full days of use, turning it on and off repeatedly for several hours and taking pictures in various conditions (inside, outside, low light, bright light, movement, ect) I have over 500 good pictures and still have half the battery left.After doing some research online and using this camera like I have I can safely say I would buy this camera again.", "Date": "June 26, 2010"}, {"Title": "Not a winner.", "Author": "Jason B. Gusmann", "ReviewID": "R2F0I9X2WNC36C", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "I recently dropped my Canon camera in water and needed something to replace it, and FAST. This camera was cheap, looked nice and had some good reviews. On the surface it really is nice, good zoom and the screen is beautiful. But once I started to use it more, I was disappointed. It takes forever to take a picture without the flash due to face detection and it can't take until it's focused, which makes the pictures nice but it's hard to capture a fast moment. It ruins it. Second, you can't store the photos unless you drag them and drop them onto your computer screen. What a hassle. And third, the battery life is terrible. I charge it and two hours later, it's dead. Overall, I'd say keep looking if you're looking for something more advanced.", "Date": "June 14, 2010"}, {"Title": "Good Camera", "Author": "Michael P. Dawson \"a_grim_repo\"", "ReviewID": "RQ1FCU4GGO7P7", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I've been reading the reviews and I felt as though I need to clarify somethings.1. This Camera takes excellent photos I know a lot of people complain about how blurry they are but that's only because they look at the photos from the lcd display they never actually inspect them from the computer. When you view photos on the (actual) camera they look bad simply because the screen is not equipped to handle them When you actually print the photos or look at them on a computer monitor the quality shows.2. Speaking of photos it does take a while to take a photo about 2 secs for the camera to auto focus and to take the shot. So that I agree with.That means if you spin in circles and take a picture yes it will come out blurry.3. The video does not record sound very well but does work hard to eliminate background noise. I was playing the radio in the background and only my voice registered.4. 14 MP means you can zoom in for days(through the computer) which is what I love. I like being able to take a picture and read someone's license plate from 100 yards away.Overall I bought this Camera to take pictures of my car and show off to my family. I don't expect to be able to take a high quality picture of the moon or driving 80 miles an hour but I do expect it to take pictures of people posing and stationary objects and it does that wonderfully.

It was only 7mp, so I knew if I got a camera that was more than double the quality, I would be satisfied- Which i was!The quality of the photos was amazing, and it was a really easy-to-use camera. I didn't really read the instructions, but i figured it out anyway! The screen is nice and big, and doesn't get dirty easily. If it does, the camera comes in this little paper thing that can be used to clean the LCD.One thing is that if you don't like noisy cameras, watch out for this one because it makes a sound every time you push a button. Personally, I think it's really cool but that's just my opinion. You may be able to mute the sound, but I'm not sure yet.The only problems I have with this camera is that first of all, I can't get open the A/V out plug thing, so that may be a problem for me. =) Another thing is that for the zoom, Amazon makes it sound like it's amazing because it's 4x OPTICAL zoom. However, it has no DIGITAL zoom, in other words, you can't zoom on the actual screen before you take a picture. It's still good, though.The color is really nice; a little darker than the picture but it's pretty. I really like the different features this camera has, like being able to crop the images on the camera.The video mode is great, because you can hear the sound when you're playing it on the camera- my old one didn't do that. The only problem with the video is that you can't zoom in/out while taking a video, and you have to make sure it's at the right place before you start taping.Anyway, this is an awesome camera and takes absolutely beautiful pictures. It's really light and can easily fit into one's pocket. I would definitely recommend it!", "Date": "July 9, 2010"}, {"Title": "Below-average performance with an eventual crash", "Author": "samsquamsch", "ReviewID": "RF2J55VYPZ50Y", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I owned the DSC-W330 for about 10 months, and the pictures it took were \"adequate\". It struggled with any form of moving shot, requiring absolute stillness to take a shot in focus, and even then it looked pretty mediocre when you zoomed in on any part of the image; every picture has a slightly \"fuzzy\" quality when you zoom in. Macro shots are pretty terrible, focusing on one plane in front of the camera (and thus throwing everything else out of focus). At a macro level, the camera may focus on a plane 2 inches in front of the screen, and everything projecting forward or back from that plane is going to be out of focus. The automatic selection of what mode to shoot in was also a bit annoying at times, and I'd rather have that control to myself. Finally, most damning of all, my DSC-W330 began having technical problems about a week ago; the lens would extend, then retract, then extend again when I turned it on, and then I could use the camera. Today, however, the lens extended and retracted four times before a message saying \"Please turn the camera off and on again\" came up. Doing this did not fix the problem, and after a bit of searching I'm discovering it's a fairly common problem for this camera to just flat-out die on you. I bought this as a replacement for my previous Sony Cybershot W50 dying, and it looks like I'll be going with either a Panasonic or a Canon shortly. I'm not going to bother with asking for a refund or repair because it will most likely cost more than half the cost of the thing to fix, which is not worth it to me; I'd rather have a good camera.", "Date": "September 27, 2010"}, {"Title": "Great Camera.

It is also extremely slow to focus with absolutely no point and shoot capability if you don't have an extra 2 seconds to wait for it to figure out what its doing before it takes a picture.  I have missed more of my kids smiles than I can count with this camera, by the time it takes a picture the moment is gone.  I feel like this is a classic example of new technology selling on gimmics like smile detection while leaving out the truly important basics. Focus is extremely lame, no matter what settings I use it comes out soft. Sometimes in darker conditions it will get confused and take almost 5 seconds to take a picture.

You might fiddle with the settings a bit in the beginning, but it's really a one mode pony.  The biggest problem with this camera is it simply can not produce a non-blurry photo unless I put it down on the table, set a 2 second delay, press play, and then not touch it at all until the shot is done.  Literally, the simple shake of the camera from pushing the shutter button causes enough movement of the camera to blur photo (the button is quite stiff).  Terrible.  Contrary to other reviews that say \"you must be break dancing while taking photos and only viewing the images on the preview screen\" this is patently false.  I've held my breath, used a tripod, and the quality is poor no matter what screen I look at the photos on. Night shots with long exposure times?  Guaranteed you will get motion blur.  It may have a 14.1 MP sensor, but it's absolutely crippled by the lack of noise filtering (speckling) and shake correction (blur); I've used less expensive 8 MP cameras that produced far sharper images.Video quality is also quite poor.  You'd think they would have at least attempted to do 800x600, but alas they decided to go for 640x480.  To summarize the result, it looks the exact same as my integrated webcam from 3 years ago with no details and mediocre focus.  The quality is ok if you want to take a video of something up-close, but this camera would not even remotely come close to being a substitute for your own two eyes.Misc info - In case anyone is wondering, the battery only lasts about 50 min for video.  50 min of video (at 640x480) takes up about 3 GB or so.  Each image taken at full 14.1 MP resolution uses anywhere from 3.5 to 5 mbyte.  I wasn't really counting, but without flash you can get maybe a few hundred shots before the battery dies.  With flash on for each shot, battery is depleted much much quicker.

Bad exposure and noisy, less detailed, and blurry pictures compared to the others. We were using a Canon SD1300 IS, which costs less than this camera, and it blew this one out of the water in terms of picture quality. The screen on this camera might be big, but it was of horrible quality as well. In addition, the 'Easy' mode on this camera is completely worthless and constantly cranks ISO up too high to preserve any kind of detail. I fully recommend avoiding this camera at all costs, and cannot believe how many good reviews this thing is getting.We were taking indoor family pictures with and without flash from 7-15 feet away in decent lighting, so there are no excuses for pictures turning out as bad as they did. Outdoor pictures may turn out better, but I don't think there are any saving graces for this thing.", "Date": "December 24, 2010"}, {"Title": "Quality", "Author": "Mevaldt", "ReviewID": "R2J8U8IAP8D7CD", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This camera is really good.

She takes it around with her almost everywhere. However, one day she wanted to record a song on the radio so she could Google the lyrics. Our radio is on top of our refrigerator. She held the camera about 1 foot above her head. She recorded the whole song and was excited to hear it play back. However, when she pressed \"Play\" she was puzzled. She could not hear anything. She turns up the volume, which the highest is 8... she barely heard the song. We looked closer at the camera and it seems that the only place for sound to enter is through two tiny holes in the top right corner of the camera. My daughter has to hold the camera as close as possible to the object if she wants to hear the sounds play back.On the other hand, she says that the pictures are beautiful. \"If I published these pictures, people would think I'm a professional!\" :) Overall, this camera is lovely for capturing pictures.

To my great disappointment, this camera is nothing like it! While it does take some nice photos during the day when there is good sunlight, as soon as you need to use the flash, the photos do not turn out at all. The pictures become blurry and often they are all red (redscale instead of grayscale if you will) because of an auto-detect flash setting function built in to the camera. I tried to manually change around the flash settings but to little success; the photos were still very much sub-par and not at all what I would expect from this camera. This happened during a family outing to look at Christmas lights, so it is particularly unfortunate that we won't have many good photo memories from that trip. The one time the camera did take great shots was when I took some close-ups of flowers indoors, with good lighting (also during the same outing). Therefore, if you plan on using this at all during the night,the camera's convenient size allows it to fit into a small hangbag but don't be fooled.

I was turning it on & off all day, taking pictures all day, filming movies all day. It was crazy! At the end of the day when my friend's cousins picked us up, we took a good 10 minutes looking at the pictures we took. Still, it was hanging on. I even had enough battery life left to upload the pictures the next day.So of course when it stopped working after three long, hard, rough years, I wanted to get another Sony. I'm very pleased & impressed! Its compact enough that I can put it in my front pocket and forget its there. My last camera was somewhat chunky. It takes GREAT pictures when there's a great light source. I don't like using flash but sometimes you have to. If you can't get a good natural light source, might I suggest pressing the shutter button half way down until you hear the click and then take a picture. It helps the photo focus. It also has a good battery life. I got it on December 8th and it didn't need to be charged until December 17th. My cousin loved my camera so much that she got the same one in the same color(blue). Overall, we're both quite satisfied with our cameras.

One of my main gripes about this camera is the picture quality. I've tried just about every setting on this camera but the clarity of my photos remain shadowed, blurry and some have a reddish undertone to them. The best photos I've taken with this cam is in direct sunlight outside, no flash. The clarity of the photos don't give a sense of reality at all, especially up close pics have the tendency to look airbrushed & blurred. The flash tends to take away from the clarity & detail as well. It's also really slow when shooting, so if you're trying to capture something really quick its NOT gonna happen. I've played around with it for 2 months to no avail and I've finally decided to just return it and save up for the Cybershot HX1.

That said, it isn't easy telling the poor buggers no, so I end up spending a small truckload of money on this site each month.This camera is a prime example. The dude we're talking about in this case comes from a place where, I imagine, indoor plumbing probably doesn't exist yet, electricity may or may not be present, and his 25 kids most likely don't wear shoes.Who needs any of that when you've got a sweet new camera?? Now you can take photos of all the poverty and squalor and upload them to your favorite social networking site! Yay! Assuming first, of course, you hit somebody else up to order you a laptop, then you bothered another 4 guys for all the accessories, peripherals, carrying cases, etc. Once all those bases are covered, and you find a dialup connection somewhere in the village, you'll be living the TCN dream.I really would've liked to try this camera out, but at the end of the month when I see my credit card bill, I can't bring myself to spend money on the things I want. That's about the end of my rant I suppose. If you ever meet a TCN, thank him for keeping the US Postal Service alive, and ask if you can see his s***ty pictures. You get 10 extra points if he's wearing a US Polo Assn watch also ordered from Amazon.

I bought my mom a Nikon Coolpix with touchscreen and my dad got the Sony Cybershot. I needed a new point and shoot anyway so he gave me this one. I tried it and immediately hated it. First of all, I have owned a previous model of the Cybershot before and I LOVE it. I've never had any issues with it except that it's rather old. On a 1GB card, I could take at least 500 photos with a 3M setting. I could also take at least 2 hours worth of video (that's WITH those 500 photos) When I tried out this camera, (with the same 1GB card) I saw that I could only take 8 minutes worth of video! That's after I deleted most of my photos leaving about 50 left on the card. The one nice thing about the camera is the way it lets you delete photos, where you can select multiple photos to delete instead of going through and deleting one by one.My other huge issue is the fact that it's a wide angle lens. WHO SHOOTS PEOPLE IN WIDE ANGLE???? It is not flattering at ALL! Needless to say, I'm returning this product and either I'm going to deal with my old reliable camera, or go out and buy the same Nikon that I got my mom.", "Date": "December 26, 2010"}, {"Title": "Received in a poorly packaged condition", "Author": "Walter Suminski", "ReviewID": "R1MM834W3G16UW", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "This item was ordered as a gift and was gift wrapped as ordered.

As a semi-professional photographer, I have some standards that I expect from a modern 12st century camera. All the reviews here made this camera sound fantastic. I made the splurge. I have not owned a Point And Shoot for years.Where can I start? When I first put the battery into the camera, I noticed the plastic door to hold the battery in. It felt like it was just going to break off if I was not careful. I work at a zoo, I need a durable camera I can put in my pocket and take around with me without worrying that parts are going to break off. I turned on the camera and literally heard and felt every component in the camera turn on. The motor shakes the camera when the lens is zooming in or out and the zoom is so noisy for being such a small zoom.The buttons feel so cheap. Every singly button is loose. When the lens is extended the whole thing slides around if you touch it.I would not recommend this camera.", "Date": "April 1, 2011"}, {"Title": "Never received", "Author": "Jackie Galvin \"Jackies Reviews\"", "ReviewID": "R25NHNB6EO61AG", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "Should have used UPS instead of the unreliable United States Post Office as they say it was delivered, but never was delivered to me!
