{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Not worth it for an adult purchase!!!", "Author": "Missy Shake \"MS.\"", "ReviewID": "RY9ZLCLPWT9X7", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "This camera only takes a good picture if you are close, the subjects are not moving, and by holding the camera still after some seconds of taking the picture! When you take a picture from afar and zoom in the picture on the screen looks good, but when you print out the picture it's pretty much garbage! I think I paid $40.00 for this camera and I bought it for my mom as a Christmas gift in 2007. Not a good gift at all for an adult and I actually bought her a new camera this year as a replacement! It would be great for a child to play around with maybe but not for an adult. I felt soo bad when I found out how difficult this camera is to operate.  Another minus is when you use the flash it a takes LONG time to take the next picture. My suggestion is to pay a little more for the Kodak Easy Share that camera is much better than this one and it's not too expensive.", "Date": "December 26, 2008"}, {"Title": "Great beginner camera", "Author": "Brenda Shepard", "ReviewID": "R1OHBKBJ597KU5", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I purchased this camera for my 9yr old son to use for scouts.

I tried looking in the manual to see how to fix it, and increasing the photo size from 2 megapixels to 5 (which should help with minimally blurry pictures) did very little to clear the pictures up.  In other words, the only way to clear up blurry pictures of coins on this camera is to hold the camera so high up above the coin that you can barely make out any detail on the coin.In summary, while this is a great camera, it is only great for taking distance photos, the 6 inch closeups taken on this camera are horribly blurry, if you're looking to take pictures of you're kids from a couple hundred feet away so they don't know you're taking a picture of them, this is the perfect stealth camera for that, especially since the flash, by default, is off, since unless the room is pretty dark, you don't need the flash, but if you're wanting to take pictures of coins or any other object that you really need to zoom in close on, I recommend the HP Photosmart M437 5MP Digital Camera with 3x Optical Zoom", "Date": "August 24, 2009"}, {"Title": "Not as good as it seems...", "Author": "F. Portier \"chutchut\"", "ReviewID": "R2CWHM0ORCHCLZ", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "My mom bought this camera for me awile ago. It was good at first but it's cheap. First off it has NO SOUND. So theres really no point in getting a camera with no sound. Second it uses batteries, good camereas don't take batteries. And it uses the batteries up in seconds. When I turn it on sometimes it just freezes. And now after having it for only awile it's slow. I do not recomend this camera.", "Date": "November 14, 2008"}, {"Title": "Comment", "Author": "K.
