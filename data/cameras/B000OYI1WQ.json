{"Reviews": [{"Title": "No expert/pro help needed", "Author": "Daniel Chereau", "ReviewID": "RDHUAQVRDYEZ5", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Before getting the remote, and based on previous reviews, I had the impression that I would need to go to a professional alarm installation store (ie. Best Buy) in order to program it. The remote comes with very easy to follow instructions for the \"learning\" process. You WILL NEED to know where the physical \"valet\" button on your car alarm system is. It took me a while to find it, following some cables under the hood/near the fuse box in my car (which I believe is why SOME people might need to get expert help).Once you find the valet button, the process is really simple and straightforward, and you won't need any further tools. The remote controller comes ready to use, with batteries already installed.
