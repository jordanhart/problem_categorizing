{"Reviews": [{"Title": "This is the Digital Camera I Always Wanted", "Author": "givpilot", "ReviewID": "RVUJFBQBQNUCR", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This is a camera that defies reason.  Having said that, there are a few very definite and logical reasons why this camera is an attractive purchase.  And why I bought one.First, it offers an excellent image sensor and that's the heart of any digital camera.  It is the same sensor that Nikon employs in its flagship DSLR, the Nikon D4.  It's a 16.2 MP sensor that also offers extraordinary low light performance.  Since the D4 retails at around $6,000, the Df offers access to Nikon's, arguably, best sensor at less than half the price of the D4.  Nikon does offer cameras with higher megapixel ratings, but their low light performance does not match the performance of the D4's.  Period.So, when considering the Df, the first question that must be answered is whether low light performance is more important than sensor MP count.  If it's MP count, then the Nikon D600 and D800 series cameras offer more.  But if it's low light performance, particularly holding detail in shadows in low light situations, then either the D4 or the Df is the answer.  For me, the D4 was out of the question because of price - and I simply don't need all the other features of the D4, the frame rate, high buffer capacity, I don't need video, etc.  And I didn't want the bulk of the D4.The other potential deal changer is the lack of a pop-up flash on the Df.  To be honest, I wish it had one.  I like using the pop-up  flash on my other Nikon digital cameras; most often using it in the \"commander\" mode to trigger remote flashes.  Now, I have to mount a flash unit to the accessory shoe and use that as the commander.  It works just as well, it's just a little bulky with the mounted flash unit.  This was almost a deal killer for me, but when I really thought about the number of times that I used the pop-up flash on my other cameras, I decided I could live without it.The \"final\" consideration regarding the Df is its size and weight.  When I received mine, I was surprised at how small it was - even smaller than the pictures seemed to indicate.  That's not to say that it's too small; rather it fits very nicely to hand and is much more comfortable to use than the larger Nikons.  That's a big plus.  I also have a Leica and, while the Df is not as small and nimble to use as the Leica, it comes close.  A really big plus.So those are the major considerations: sensor performance, lack of a pop-up flash and its great compact, unobtrusive size.  Everything else, when comparing the Df to other Nikon cameras, is not nearly as relevant.Except for one very important thing.  And what prompted me to order one when it was first announced.  Its style.  This camera takes me back to the time that I fell in love with photography in the first instance; the days of the Nikon F film cameras, particularly the F3HP.  Everything I've written above really doesn't matter.  This is a camera that is purchased on an emotional basis, not an intellectual one; with the heart, rather than the mind.  When I hold it, the controls fall into place perfectly.  Muscle memory from decades ago causes my fingers to fall perfectly onto the controls.  This camera frees me from the technical aspects of photography to focus on the creative aspects.  This camera is perfect.  Now if I could only figure out where to load the film...", "Date": "November 29, 2013"}, {"Title": "It is an Amazing Camera!", "Author": "Photo Dude", "ReviewID": "R23A8TDPMDDY5B", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I was trained using a film camera, but never used one professionally. I owned a N70 and rarely used it. I got the D100, then the D200 and later the D300 and loved them all when they were released. All the \"D\" cameras were used professionally. I also have the 14-24mm 2.8, 24-70mm 2.8 and 70-200mm 2.8. The Df is my first FX camera. I don't care about the retro look, on board flash (cause I use the SB-900 if I need one), video, or the 1/8000 really - it would be nice to have that, but it's not a deal breaker at all. I like that the images are 16MB. I can produce large prints and manage the files easier.I found the body to be a little challenging on my hands (I have large hands) being that the camera is so small compared to the D300 with the vertical grip. It's clearly not like the D300 which has great ergonomics for my hands. However - I can't stop picking up the camera and shooting with it. I hadn't EVER had a feeling like this before. Because of its small size and light weight I want to bring it around with me everywhere. It's true, this camera will slow you down. It'll make you think about your shot a bit more and that is a really good thing. I was teaching someone about how to use their new Nikon 5300 and he was shooting manual and moving like a bandit. So fast and furious. He was missing what he was doing wrong. This camera forces you a lot more to look at what settings you've got and go from there.It is a beautiful camera and I LIKE the dials. I can turn a lot of them with the lock with one hand. You just need to spend time with it to figure how best to work with it. Seriously, the dials are awesome and they really are an option if you don't care to use them.Here's what I wish it had: a low light emitter. My camera focuses great in low light! I'm not sure what other people are complaining about, but my camera is fantastic in low light. The option to have the low light emitter would be nice. I wish it had a better grip. I wish it had a second card slot. That's it.I also got the special 50mm 1.8. My lens is AWESOME. I have a great copy. Super sharp wide open. If you have this lens and it is soft, return it, but I'm glad I have it. In fact I'm planning of getting more primes!The battery is better than the D300. Really nice!Cost - yes compared to other models, its expensive and you're not getting all the features, but here's the deal - you are getting the D4 sensor! That alone is amazing! You really have no idea how awesome this camera is until you have it for a while and shot with it. The price is right. Yes, I wish it had some things included in it, but I'm not returning this baby because of it. I love it.The TOOL produces AMAZING images and encourages me to use it! Low light capabilities will change the way you shoot.Hope this was helpful. It's my first post.", "Date": "January 7, 2014"}, {"Title": "The Nikon Df is my Favorite Nikon Camera. Period.", "Author": "Steve Huff", "ReviewID": "R2Q64FQKGRO9Y2", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "The Nikon Df has been in my hands for only a couple of days and I will be doing a full extended review on my website (some of you may know where that is). I am not a DSLR fan, and have not owned one since the D700 when it was launched quite a few years ago. One thing I did not like about the D700 and future D800 and D3, D4, etc was the huge size and weight. New mirror less cameras have been arriving that can meet and exceed some DSLRs (Sony RX1R for one).But the Df, with its retro build and style captured my heart when I saw it. I shoot with a Leica M and a Sony RX1. When I saw the images of the Df I was taken back to the 70's when Nikon REALLY made cameras that stood the test of time in looks, design, functionality and build quality.I did not think i would like the Df as it looked huge to me in photos. Last thing I want is a heavy and large bulky DSLR. But when the camera arrived I was shocked at how light it was. In fact, my Leica M with tiny 35 Summaron felt heftier and was. The Df looks tough but feels a little cheap but I believe Nikon did this to solve the weight issue. I mean, C.mon..the D800 and D4 are TANKS and for everyday shooting they are not ideal, especially once you get a taste of those small HQ mirror less cameras.I would never buy a D800 or D4 for everyday snaps. Pro work? yes. Daily shooters? No way Jose. Just not enjoyable, and a camera has to be enjoyable for me to want to shoot with it. One  reason I love my Leica so much.As for the kit 50 1.8 SE lens, it is average. Soft wide open, very light, nothing like a classic Nikon lens. Probably worth the $100 but this camera deserves a high quality fast 50mm prime.The D4 sensor is the king of the night of any full frame cameras. I tested it at 6400 and 12,800 and saw no noise in my prints or web sized images. Astounding. The Sony A7, A7r or Leica M can not do this.I have much more shooting to do but I commend Nikon on the Df. It is handsome, rugged, lightweight and offers some of the best Full Frame IQ you can get. Pair it with some HQ fast primes, even classic AI primes, and you are all set.As for manual focus, I had no issues whatsoever manually focusing a 50 1.2. AT all.AF is fast but not as fast as my Olympus E-M1 and I still prefer a nice HQ EVF to an optical but the Df is a joy to shoot due to the smaller size, lower weight, and it inspires confidence in the manual controls and design.As for those dials, they are great. For those that want to LEARN, set it to manual and all controls are easily accessible without having to menu dive. Brilliant. Those who are complaining about the dials are just not up for shooting a manual camera. But the cool part is that you can also shoot it in full auto.Love it. THIS is my favorite Nikon camera but I have to decide if I want to keep the black or silver. :)My review samples are in and I will be testing these with various lenses over the next 3 weeks. It is a camera that gets me excited to go out and shoot, and that just does not happen for me with DSLR's. That right there tells me this is something special.I gave it 4 stars because I do feel the price point should have hit $2500 with the lens. Also, it is not as sturdy feeling as I had hoped (then again, that could have added to the weight).Some key points from my 1st use:Battery Life is amazing  - best I have seenD4 quality in a small body. Enough said,Build could be sturdier.Feels good in the hand though grip is small.AF is fast, Manual Focus is easy.Dials are superb, love them.IQ with the kit lens is good but not WOW. The kit lens is soft/average.Best low light I have seen besides the D4Light as my Leica M in real useTo those complaining about the cost (I did a little but as well) think about it... To those who do not WANT a huge DSLR like the D800 or an ugly D600 and want top class low light performance (best in class) - with the flagship sensor...$2700 is not a bad buy. You have to buy what you will WANT to shoot with. Me, if a D4, D800 and the Df was offered to me for free..just had to pick one..it would be the Df. Why? Because due to the size, weight and look of  the others I would never take them out. The Df is a daily shooter and that is what Nikon had in mind.", "Date": "December 3, 2013"}, {"Title": "Purchased for low light", "Author": "E. Nixon", "ReviewID": "R2KEG1ZO335T3U", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I'm a hobbyist when it comes to photography.  Primarily for taking pictures of my kid and the events that we attend.  I tend to do a lot of indoor shots, and before I got the Df I pretty much had the flash hooked up all of the time.  I wanted a camera that was FX since most of my lenses were already FX, so my choices were D800, D610 and the Df.  Major factors in my decision were Low Light vs Mega Pixel vs Price...  D4 was never on the list due to the heavy price.  Low light photography won as the primary factor.  Video was not on the list since the majority of the time I have taken video was by accident.Since I have gotten this camera, I have not even attached a flash.  Flash has just not been needed, even with all of the indoor shots that I do.  Post process is a little more difficult since I do not have consistent lighting (especially since last month was December and colored Christmas lights do interfere more than I expected).  But still worth the extra time required in post, plus I found that having blues, reds and greens in a shot make for some interesting shots.Auto white balance is better than any of my previous cameras.  Supposedly there are 2 auto white balance settings, but I have not read the manual deeply enough to find the second setting.  It is a little warm for Daylight and Cloudy conditions, but tolerable to leave it as is when in post.  Auto White Balance does have issues with Incandescent (WAY too warm) and Florescent (not consistent, but may be due to mixed lighting conditions).Some of the control knobs are not the way that I would have designed them, but still usable if not needing to make adjustments on the fly.  On several occasions I have used the incorrect indicator for setting ISO.  The decreased light (compared to my other cameras) in the view finder was supposed to help with manual focus, but I do not think was a good feature especially since manual focus in low light is now more difficult since I cannot see it. I did not have plans on using Live View much since it was a feature that I rarely used in the past, but the ease of access to Live View along with the horizon line, I now use it at least 5-10% of the time.The autofocus area does not reach to the 1/3 points in the frame, which I find odd since that is where I put my points of interest for a photo.  Live view does not have this limitation as far as I tell.Before I purchased, I read several reviews saying that it was not feasible to use heavier lenses with the Df.  I found that using my F2.8 28-70mm or my f2.8 70-200mm was not as bad as the reviewers stated.  I do miss the extended battery pack for stability.Overall this is the best camera that I have ever had (previous cameras, D100, D200, D300, Nikon 1 V2).", "Date": "January 4, 2014"}, {"Title": "Old school controls meets new school electronics!", "Author": "gadget-o-holic", "ReviewID": "R1V2F8AOSHTHPB", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "**EDIT 12/3/2013 - Added weight comparison**Let me say as I do with all my camera reviews that I'm not a professional photographer but just a hobbyist who appreciates cameras and gadgets in general.  As such much of my review will be more subjective rather than technical...Anyway, I have a D800e and an Olympus OM-D EM-5 for my dslr setup... I originally got the EM-5 to use as a smaller back up camera for use when I didn't want to lug around my D800e.  Now that the DF came out, it kind of fills the same niche that my OM-D did BUT it does everything SO much better.  I haven't had much time to play around with it but based off my first day with it I think I may sell all my OM-D gear and stick with this one so I can make use of all of my Nikon lenses.PROS:--------------------------------------------------- Picture Quality - Subjectively I'd say that the picture quality is on par with my D800e for most situations.  Of course, if I ever needed to crop out a ton the nod would go to the D800e but for 95% of my non-pro shooting the DF is superb and excellent in low light I should add.  Also, for comparison, in my opinion the picture quality is much better than the OM-D (not that the OM-D is bad...).- Size and Weight - Smaller and lighter than the D800e and larger than the OM-D.  For me it's the perfect balance of size/weight when paired with a smaller prime lens like the 50mm that it came with... I'll probably look at some of the older Nikon manual focus lenses now because those should pair nicely as well.- Handling - This is probably my favorite part about the camera.  I own several digital cameras and each one has a different method for changing settings like ISO, aperture, and shutter speeds and almost all the other digital cameras require 2-3 button presses and fiddling around with a tiny joystick or wheel.  With the DF, there is a physical dial for almost every major setting which is really nice so you don't have to remember how to access each one!- Huge selection of Nikon lenses available plus I already own several nice lenses that'll work nicely with this- Fast AF... not quite as fast as the D800 and not as many focus points but very quick and I rarely find myself using all of the focus points on the D800e anyway... It is noticeably faster than my OM-D but that's to be expected.  When using auto-focus the DF only missed a few times in my testing with the kit 50mm.- Styling - I love the look of this camera, it's retro look is obviously inspired by all the new cameras coming out now like the X100 lineup and the OM-D.  You can't go wrong with this IMHO.CONS:--------------------------------------------------- No video mode - not deal breaker for me but may be for some- No pop up flash - I try not to use flashes anyway and I can always use a small flash mounted to the camera if needed- SD cards only - this one kind of hurts... it'd be nice to have CF and SD card slots so the CF could be primary and SD backup like the D800e- Balance may be a bit off with the larger Nikon lenses - best to stick with the lighter prime lenses if possibleWEIGHT COMPARISON:--------------------------------------------------I was curious to see the weight comparisons between the D800e, DF, and OM-D.  In my weights I put the 50mm 1.8g on both the D800e and DF and for the OM-D E-M5 I put on an equivalent Panasonic Lumix G Micro 4/3 LEICA DG SUMMILUX 25mm f/1.4 Leica Aspherical Lens.  This way I could get a weight comparison of each camera with a 50mm lens on each.Nikon D800e - 2lb 12.6 ozNikon DF - 2lb 4 ozOlympus OM-D E-M5 - 1lb 11 ozInterestingly the weight differences between both the D800e to the DF and DF to OM-D E-M5  is around 8-9 oz per my kitchen scale.  There aren't really any conclusions to draw from this but thought it may be useful for those of you that were looking at these models...CONCLUSION:--------------------------------------------------I love the camera.  It's expensive, yes, but for full frame, full controls, and the ability to natively use all my Nikon lenses it's worth it!  If you have the money and have Nikon equipment already this is a camera that you should seriously consider.  If you already have the 50mm 1.8g, though, I'd say skip the special edition and get the body only kit.  The lenses are essentially the same with the only differences being the casing.Recommended for - people wanting to get another full frame Nikon camera as a backup or people wanting a full frame dslr with more/easier manual controlsNot Recommended for - people making the first jump in to full frame (IMO the D800 or D800e would be a better value for your money) or people who need/want full frame video or high megapixels for croppingAs I get more real world use with this camera I'll probably update my review since I've only had it for a day.

I currently own a Canon 5D Mark 2 and recently purchased a Canon 5D Mark 3.  I own a collection of zoom and prime Canon \"L\" lenses.  Last month, a friend suggested I look in to this new Nikon Df SLR.  I've never heard of the Nikon Df camera until my friend mentioned it to me.  So I did my research, and I'm glad I did.I must admit it was the retro styling that got my attention at first.  I thought the pricing was a bit optimistic, but I kept an open mind. The day it came out, I rushed out to the nearest camera store as I needed to see this thing.  I had to touch it, feel it... I had to have it in my hands and then decide if I really wanted it.  At first, I walked away from it and decided against it because I felt like I was getting caught up in the hype.But on my way home, I had to turn back.  I needed to have a second look at this camera.  I felt I was influenced by some of the negative reviews I had previously read on the internet and I did not give it a fair assessment.  I just had to see it again.  Yes, it was a bit pricey.  But I figured I can always resell it in the event I changed my mind.  I would take a bit of a hit on the resale price, but I was willing to take that risk.  So I ended up buying the two-tone silver and black version.  While I really liked the all-black version (it was actually my first choice), I felt that the silver and black version was THE point of having the retro look in the first place.  Just my personal take on this.After many weeks of usage, I can say that am in love with this camera!  I love the size, the weight, the workmanship, and the feel. The pictures are sharp and accurate.  This camera is stylin', and it just feels right.  I love the simplicity of this camera.I ended up selling my Canon \"L\" primes so I can buy quality Nikon glass.  I use my Df with the Nikon 35 f/1.4G, Nikon 85 f/1.4G, Nikon 135 f/2D DC, and yes even the Nikon 14-24 f/2.8G zoom lens.  The auto white balance is so natural - in any light condition, low-light shots are truly magnificent and clean with minimal noise, and I find the control dials more user-friendly than navigating through the LCD screen.  I am quite content with the auto-focus selection and speed, and I have no desire to use my Nikon Df, or any of my cameras, for video recording.I am going on a trip to Cuba next week and I will be packing this gear instead of my Canon 5D Mark 3.  It's lighter, easier to pack, and takes incredible sharp pictures with great tones.  Don't get me wrong, this is not a replacement for my Canon 5D3.  I have decided to keep them both as I believe the two worlds can co-exist!As a point of reference, I am not a professional photographer.  I am merely a hobbyist.

That's not to say it's small, but it's a LOT smaller than my D800. So here's the run down of what the Df gets you:1) Tweaked D4 sensor. This sensor bests my D800 at ISO 1000 and up and requires far less post processing to get me the color and and clean files I want. My D800 is the king at lower ISO, but all hail the \"lord of darkness\" because the Df is simply wonderful at high ISO. This is NOT only about noise, so beware of amateurs going on about that. The Df has a DR advantage that allows for color-balanced photos that don't have the flat look of high ISO D800 files. YES, I can do a lot of work and make a D800 file look pretty darn good at ISO 5000, but the Df will always be better. Yes, this camera even bests the amazing D3s. You're also working with small files, which is fast and fun.2) 39 point auto focus is what some are complaining about. Let's get real; the D600 and D610 AF works great. I tested the Df AF against my D800 and the difference in focus acquisition and lock in poor light was very close. If the spread of points across the frame is not working for you then get a D800 or D4 first.3) Top dials: Yes, you can use command dials like any other DSLR, but it's fun to use the top dials, especially outside. Shooting with MF lenses I can choose to operate this camera like my old film bodies or go \"modern\" with one of my AF-S lenses. I can work methodically or fast.4) Handling is NOT like any other DSLR. You may love it right away or need time to adapt. After 3 weeks this is my favorite grab-&-go camera and the D800 is staying home a LOT.So what I have here is a FX body that bests my D800 at higher ISO, is smaller and lighter and is wonderful to hold and behold. It feels like a premium camera with the metal dials and it needed no AF tuning with any of my lenses; a first for me. My impression is that nikon QC is under tight control with this camera.The price is a bit high, but so is the fun factor. This is not another lumpy game-controler DSLR. It's not for everyone, but I'm having a blast with it. I'm a working photographer and have already been using the Df on jobs.

One major reason I chose this camera vs the competition is the superior low light ability.  Image quality at high ISO is stunning, even better than I was expecting. Altogether, image quality in any situation is impeccable.It has a very small form factor for a full frame DSLR.  It is lighter than it looks like it should be, but still feels solid.  With the 50mm kit lens attached it is a very light weight combo, indeed.  I have exclusively used mirrorless cameras over the last few years and don't mind carrying this around a bit, DF is heavier but not uncomfortably so.  I like the look and the analog dials (opinions may differ).There has been a ton of criticism about this camera,. some valid , some unwarranted.  I'll mention a few and my take on it FWIW:Bad ergonomics - It's a retro design. It has retro ergonomics. I don't think the point of this camera is to mount big heavy zoom lenses on it.  With small primes it handles just fine IMHO.Bad AF - I'm a center focus and recompose type of shooter.  If you need AF points all over the frame, get a different camera.  I have found the af very quick and accurate with the kit lens (haven't tried any other AF lenses yet).  However, Wish It could focus in even lower light.  It goes to -1ev,  for this camera with this sensor it should go lower. Oh well.Only one sd slot - Yeah, wish there were two, but there isn't.Manual focus sucks - I haven't had a problem, the AF confirmation dot is a big help.  However, I haven't tried to focus any lens faster than f1.8.  It is a shame Nikon didn't put a retro style focusing screen.  bummer.Price - It's not cheap.  But, if you want it, you can rationalize the cost.I'm sure there are many other complaints I haven't mentioned...So to end this thing, I love the camera.  I like it for what it is and I'm not really concerned about what it isn't.  No camera is perfect and it is always a matter of tradeoffs when choosing one.  I don't have any regrets about this purchase.Cheers !", "Date": "January 22, 2014"}, {"Title": "The iPhone of DSLRs", "Author": "Flying Saucer", "ReviewID": "R2BGKENNP7QNEM", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "To me, it's like an iPhone. You either love it, or you hate it, but either way, you are aware it is seen as overpriced. If you hate it, it's overpriced. If you love it, that premium is more worth it.  Not the most advanced phone/camera, not the most customizable, but it just works well. No fuss, no frills.I really like this camera.I've been shooting Nikon since I had a Nikon EM.I've owned several of their APS-C models, most recently the 7000.I've used the 3200 and 5300 recently.I currently own a D800 and a Fujix100.Annoying things...1. Wish it had a wider spread of AF points. Not necessarily 51pt, just a wider spread. The 31 pt system was first used on a dx camera.2. Wish it had the option for a battery grip3. Wish that right sided strap lug was not in the way!4. Wish the on and off switch had a notch instead of just being a dial.5. Wish it had focus peaking in live view.6. It can't trigger CLS without sb800 or SB700/910 or third party trigger.7. Ergonomics-see below.8. Doesn't focus down to light as low as -2 EV, and no AF assist light!!! Sucks for such a great low-light sensor!!!For me, 6- 8 are the biggest issues. But none of this is a deal breaker. #8 is the worst though...It is solved with a flash though, but then see #6So how does it compare to the d800?HandlingD800 wins big time. I like how the d800 feels in my hand. I like the grip. I like the position of the shutter release button. I have no problem with the menus what so ever. I really don't need all those analog dials. I like how the d800 feels with a fast prime. I can hold the entire camera and shoot it comfortably with one hand.Holding the Df with a large prime and trying to shoot it with one hand feels off balance and awkward. YOu really have to use two hands. You need to grip the camera with the right hand a specific way to avoid that lug and you have to support a heavy prime with the left hand.I imagine the Df won't balance well with a big zoom.I hope Nikon introduces new F2 primes. I'd love to have a 35mm f2 AF-S!Auto-Focus- D800 wins again...don't have an issue with the 39 AF points vs 51 of the d800, i just wish they were spread out over the image a bit more. Not a new complaint. I do think it doesn't focus as fast in low light compared to the d800. But that's not a surprise as I think the d800 focuses down to -2EV (night) and the Df is -1. It feels a bit more hesitant in the dark, which sort of sucks because the sensor is so great for low light. Reminds of how my D7000 used to hesitate.I will say that I do not have to use AFFT on any of my lenses with Df. All my lenses have needed adjustment on my d800.Build- Tie. both are magnesium and weather sealed.Sensor- Tie. each one has their strength.Battery life- Df, but i really wish it took the D800 batteries as i have 3 already.WB- Does not lean towards green like the d800. looks better to me.ANYWAY. blah blah blah. I'm sure you can read online, i think you'll find my opinion is no different than others who have compared the two.How does it compare to my x100?apples and oranges. you can't compare an aps-c mirrorless vs a full frame...I think both cameras have their purpose. I will keep my x100 as it is so discreet. What i love about the x100 is the quiet shutter and the focus peaking. I think if i'm casually going out with friends during the day, the fuji will be my first choice. If i'm going out with a group of people or to a function and the lighting will be decent and focusing not challenging, I'll take the fuji. It's small, not pretentious, and takes very nice images.Why am i keeping it? It's really a great camera despite the negatives I've stated. after 1000 shots, it really is trouble free. As mentioned, it does what it is supposed to without any fuss or frills. Sure it's expensive, but based on absolute dollar number, it's cheaper than a leica, a d4, and some other FX cameras. I think if you are looking for a first Nikon FX camera, get the 610 and save your money for glass. You can buy Nikon D610 24.3 MP CMOS FX-Format Digital SLR Camera (Body Only), Nikon 85mm f/1.8G AF-S NIKKOR Lens for Nikon Digital SLR Cameras, and Nikon 28mm f/1.8G AF-S NIKKOR lens for a smidge more than Nikon 1528 Df 16.2 MP CMOS FX-Format Digital SLR Camera with AF-S NIKKOR 50mm f/1.8G Special Edition Lens SLR Camera with 3.2-Inch LCD (Silver). Or even better, buy a Nikon d600 , send it in to nikon claiming \"oil spots\" and hopefully they'll switch out the shutter for the 610 shutter.  Only get the Df if you have Fx glass. If you don't have Fx glass, again by the d610/600.This is my family cam. This is the camera i will take with me when i go out with family and close friends. I really want nikon to make a new 35f2 GPart of me thinks that \"Df\" means \"DSLR Finale\". as this should be nikon's last DSLR as they currently make them. They need to move towards a real \"fusion\" camera with an OVF/EVF with focus peaking and an AF system similar to Nikon 1.*****UPDATE 12/27/2013*****Just wanted to address some of the common complaints I've heard.\"It doesn't have SS of 1/8000\"-Honestly? who needs 1/8000? I understand if you want to shoot your 1.4 glass wide open during broad daylight, but chances are broad daylight is harsh light and the picture would look horrible because harsh shadows. the BETTER (for a non-pro without big strobes)  way to shoot wide open during daylight is with an ND filter that allows you to shoot 1.4 with a SS of 1/250, or whatever your flash works at best and use a flash. Sure you can do auto-FP sync at 1/8000 for fill, but the flash is so weak at that shutter speed.\"AF struggles a bit compared to 51 point of the D800/e and D4.\"Yes it does on the outer focus points. Best results for me have been back button focusing and using the center point and recomposing.Not ideal, but gives me the best results.\"no autofocus assist lamp\"-I always turned mine off because it's annoying for my shooting needs. If its that dark and you need the bright white AF lamp, your subjects will squint and react negatively to bright \"in your face\" light. When it's that dark, i use the AF assist lamp on my flash.I will say though, as much as i like the Df, using it has shown me how much camera the D800 is for the money. I'm starting to think that the Df is not expensive for what it is. I think the D800 is a bargain for what it is.*****************UPDATE 1/26/2014********************Have not used my Fujix100 or D800 in over a month.I've even thought about selling them.The Df really works for me.

If you want a good camera with those things, they are available.  The sensor, white balance control and picture control are so good on this that I almost never reach for my trusty SB400 speedlight.  (Truth be told, I wasted more time on my D7000 turning the flash off to get it out of my way.  Natural light is better.)As for video, use your iPhone.  If you want a camera that can do anything a still camera should do - you buy this camera.If you can shoot a 1,000 plus photos per battery, why do you need or want the weight of a photo grip.  Up til now my dream has been to get a D4 - WITHOUT the extra weight.  Lo and behold they made it, they just call it a Df.So, no camera is perfect, what are the CONS on the Df.COLD WEATHER - The controls that make it so wonderful and versatile are just plain hard to use in cold weather.  When your joints stiffen, so do they.NO USER settings ala U1 & U2 like the D7000, etc.  While this gets panned as a consumer not a pro feature, pros love it too and don't like the old Nikon bank bank system.ONE card slot - CF cards really are going the way of the dodo, however, nearly everybody wants TWO card slots.  This is a significant failing in design.  If you had a Nikon designer on a lie detector they will tell you that it is ON PURPOSE to try and limit the use of EyeFi cards.  If you have TWO slots you don't need to buy their WiFi dongle (which is not a great piece of kit).  An EyeFi card in the second slot as I do in my D7000 is the slickest way to back up AND get connectivity.NO REPLACEABLE FOCUS SCREENS - This camera has the best sensor that money can buy and it will take a good photo if you light a match.  HOWEVER,  focusing is another matter.  This AF is very good but NO AF can operate in real darkness over any significant range.  There are other conditions that limit AF tech as well.  The simple substitute has been out there for a long time, spit screen and other assistive focus screens.  Putting switchable focusing screens in this camera would take it from merely being an amazing enthusiasts camera to a truly professional piece of gear for many uses.  (probably not certain sports as the AF system is not as fast as the true pro systems.  You actually have to be able to use the manual focus ring some of the time.)LACK OF ANY AUTO OR PREPROG SCENES - Yeah, a lot of people think this is just a complete amateur thing.  However, the Nikon auto setting in the high end enthusiast line is so good that you find yourself using it sometimes for easy situations because it is so fast.  It would be fine to not have this IF they had included the U1 / U2 dial modes so that you could have your own personal \"auto\" settings to revert to - but they don't.Still, the look.  The ease of control with everything on top and accessible with dials.  The stunning viewfinder with 100% roof prism clarity.  The D4 sensor for a D800 price.Lawd 'mighty, I have died and gone to camera heaven.  All they could do is tweak this.  I don't need any higher rez.  I don't need no stinkin' video.  I have a pocket size flash I don't need one built into the camera.It's light, it's fast, it's beautiful.

It feels so comfortable to shoot in this camera with a prime.

The image quality is superb and the high ISO / low light capability is fantastic.  Even though I love this camera it is not your typical DSLR an that has a lot of people talking about it.I think that the one of the biggest questions that a lot of buyers have regarding the Df is who is it's intended audience?  Is this a camera meant for amateurs?  Semi-pros?  Professionals?  Some have pointed to the Df's shortcomings (39 point AF instead of 51, no 2nd memory card slot, 1/4000th max shutter speed, no video mode, etc.) as reasons why they would not use the Df for professional work.  I think that any professional could easily create quality images with the Df in most situations but they probably wouldn't use it as their \"workhorse\" camera body because there are other options available that might be more suited to the task.  Nevertheless the Df is still a very capable tool when needed.So does that mean that the Df is more geared toward amateurs?  I know that I have definitely been enjoying it for my own personal photography since i bought it.  It's lightweight which means that you can grab the Df and use it to photograph family trips, events, etc. and then use an EyeFi card to send your photos to an iPad, smartphone, or computer.  This last Christmas was the first time in several years that I've pulled out a DSLR to photograph people opening presents instead of a smartphone because it is was so easy to handle especially since there was no need to attach a speedlight.  But the price of the Df and the fact that it has the same sensor as the flagship D4 seems to suggest that it is not aimed solely at amateurs or for personal use.I think that the Df is meant for photographers who want a camera that can provide a nice blend of \"work\" and \"play\".  I know that I personally love using this camera because it is so fun to use and I have a hard time putting it down.  But I also wouldn't have any reservations about shooting professional quality portraits with the Df especially with it's amazing sensor.  It's a beautiful blend of both worlds and although it may not be the right camera for everyone it certainly fits my needs quite well.", "Date": "January 2, 2014"}, {"Title": "A really cool camera.", "Author": "TravelWriter", "ReviewID": "R3UF6EMMNI4YYS", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I might as well throw my two cents in.

It takes great pictures as long as you use it with great lenses (the Nikkor 70-200 2.8, the 85 1.4, etc), especially in low light. It's lighter than my D700, and frankly I don't need all the D700's bells and whistles to take a great picture. And I don't shoot video. The shutter is quieter than the D700's, battery life much longer, controls much simpler. I don't agree with other reviewers that you can't control the dials with one hand. Fast focusing.  I don't really care that it looks \"cool\" although yes, you'll get comments, questions and stares the moment you take it out, but I'm dealing.

(One-time Nikon dealer, some-time pro; now merely a knowledgeable amateur.  :) )  I can't recount how many times I've wished for a modern, digital camera with a traditional control layout (usually expressed as \"Give me a digital F4!\").  Well, the Df is not a digital F4, but I'm grateful even that it's a digital FA.  For all the years I've spent using digital Nikons, I still find a dial control layout to be more intuitive.  Perhaps it's the 'bicycle' I once learned to ride and never forgot how to, and it's what I still prefer.  I don't miss video capability (there are so much better options) and a built-in flash (never use).  Thanks, Nikon, for building this camera.", "Date": "December 19, 2013"}, {"Title": "Early review based on a few days of usage", "Author": "Peter Singh", "ReviewID": "RLN783POP8FE5", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This is an early review, but I really like this camera.  I intend to update this review once I get more shoots under my belt.By way of background I'm both an photo enthusiast and a little bit of a gadget nut.  My other equipment currently includes a Canon 5D Mark III with some L glass, and a Sony Nex 7.As my needs evolve I find myself wanting to lug around my Canon equipment with the heavy zoom 2.8 lenses less and less.  Hence when i saw the opportunity to get a full frame sensor in a small package I read all the necessary reviews and went for it.  My initial concerns going in were the lack of video, the fact that I wasn't familiar with Nikon systems and I wanted to make sure any glass I bought was going to be both lightweight and excellent which are hard things to do unless you stick with moderately fast primes.The rest of this is based on my first impressions and about three days of shooting:1. Build quality is excellent, I went for the all black model and I'm happy I did.  I did read some concerns on other reviews about the quality of the magnesium alloy plating on the silver model but to me the all-black one is solid, feels like it constructed well and feels great to hold.  it is substantial and perhaps a tiny bit bigger than I expected before i got it but a worthwhile reduction in bulk which is what I was going for.2.  I do find that having the dials on top of the camera to show exposure settings, ISO etc. mean that I am more likely to creatively tinker with things, for example I shot some high ISO shots in a dimly lit environment last night when in the past I wasn't very likely to go through menus and settings to make ISO changes preferring to leave it on Auto unless I really needed to.3.  So far I have used the 50mm F1.8G lens it came with I find the combination of the camera and lightweight and small fast normal lens to be wonderful.  Its a compact package with fantastic image quality, pictures are sharp, blurred backgrounds are wonderfully soft and really bring out the subject and performance in low light is great.  I'm really enjoying using this setup right now and intend to have this combination be my primary walk around combination for the next several weeks.4.  I did not purchase an external flash since the camera doesn't have one and don't think i will need one for most things due to the fast lens and capabilities of the full frame sensor.  i did buy the Nikon 70-200 F4 lens and while its a lot lighter than my 70-200F2.8L Canon lens its still a little too bulky in my view for everday walk-around.  I haven't shot as much with this lens and will update when I do more.5.  Some minor nits are that its relatively easy to knock the auto/manual focus button on the front of the camera when making other adjustments and the cover of the battery compartment separates from the body relatively easily and then needs to be slotted back in, minor items for sure.All in all I'm very pleased so far and look forward to shooting more and returning with more feedback.", "Date": "December 5, 2013"}, {"Title": "Pure photography indeed", "Author": "Cheng Ziqiang", "ReviewID": "R3931JU7NXGIGC", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I ignored all those trolls out there and purchased this camera in a heart beat and I am so glad I did so.I am not going to go over the specs comparisons and such, I am just going to tell you what I did after receiving this camera and how I feel after using it extensively for 3 days.day 1, I went on to the street and shot, shot shot.day 2, I went on to the street and shot, shot, shot, shot.day 3, I went on to the street and shot, shot, shot, shot, shot.I simply love taking photos with this camera, the dial, the shutter, the viewfinder, the overall feel in my hand, it's just wonderful.And the result?

The body doesn't justify the $800 premium over a D600.  So from a logical standpoint, at $3,000 the D800 is a far superior camera and at $2,000 the D610 is a far cheaper camera.But logic misses the point of this camera.  This camera is about emotion.  From that aspect this is a very nice camera.  First, it looks old school so the vast majority of people are going to think it is some sort of film camera and dismiss it.  This makes it quite the stealth camera and a fine conversation piece.  The quite mode works nicely.  It does not make the camera silent but it does reduce the shutter noise.  The camera feels great in the hand, has quirky handling, and has outstanding IQ. That really is all you need to know to make an emotional purchasing decision.However, for completeness I will continue.  The construction is good but it does mix and match plastic with metal unlike the all metal D800.  The feel of the dials is very nice.  Everything you need for shooting is available on the top of the camera in a very non-cluttered functional top plate.  ISO and Exposure Comp are on the left and shutter speed, PSAM, and aperture are set on the right side.  The Exposure Comp dial sits on top of the ISO dial which makes it a little tricky to find without looking.  Also, for some reason it has a lock on it also so you have to press the lock and rotate the dial requiring a tricky press and rotate maneuver or 2 hands.  This is a dial I use a lot so I am not thrilled about this.  The ISO dial with its lock is even more of a pain.  You need two hands to move it and it requires an awkward grip on the camera to reach it.  Good thing you don't need it very often.  If you do need frequently move it you will most likely go into the menus and switch on the Auto ISO feature.  The PASM dial is also a quirky as you have to lift it up to turn it.  I often miss S or A and hit either P or M.  No you won't accidentally move to a different mode but that has never been a problem for me on any camera.  The pull up dial is a solution to a problem which didn't exist and not a good solution at that.You can change the aperture on your D series lenses by the lens itself.  However, the camera dos not come setup to do that.  If you try, it will give you an FE error.  To set this up you need to go into the menus.  The design of the front aperture change dial is very poor.  It is a vertical wheel that does not extend up past the top and it is small that com pined with the dampening makes it is a pain to change the aperture with the dial.The shutter speed is another interesting dial as it only has full stop differences.  You can use the rear dial to fine tune the shutter speed after you have rotated to the top dial to get it in the ball park.  Not really a practical solution for either M or S priority.  Note this is an option you have to turn on in the menus.  It is not automatically on.  There is a place on the dial to put the top dial on 1/3 EV and then you change the shutter speed with the rear dial like any other modern DSLR.  This is where I let the dial most of the time.I don't usually feel the need to put my reading glasses on to use most of my cameras.  However, with this camera, all the fonts on top are very small and I have a very hard time reading them without glasses.  If you are older than your mid 40s this is something to watch out for.SoThe top and front of the camera are very nice and retro looking.  The back of the camera looks and works just like any other Nikon DSLR.  So while the fact you can set your exposure values from the dials on top is very nice the manual dial handling on this camera is quirky and slow.  I think you will find, like the much touted Fuji hybrid OVF/EVF which most people only used in EVF mode, you will end up setting the camera to be used in modern DSLR mode.  This likelihood and the need to dive into the menus to accomplish some things breaks the nostalgic spell a little.  Also, I find it odd there is no video but there is a picture retouch menu in the camera.  Does any serious photographer actually post process their images in camera.  I don't think so and I don't really see this as a retro feature either.  It would have been very tough to post process film in the camera.Also, while the camera is smallish, the lenses are still full size.  So if you pop on a 70-200 f/2.8 or 135 f/2, this is still going to be a rather large and heavy system to tote around.  The viewfinder is a nice bright .7x OVF but I would have been more impress with the old school .86x.  Also, there is no way to change out the focus screens.  A bigger concern, however, is the lack of a second card slot.  This is not a big deal for casual shooting but for event shooting having a back up is very nice.The IQ on this camera is outstanding.  From DxOMark the D4 scores are as follows Color Depth  24.7 bits, Dynamic Range 13.1 and Low Light ISO 2965.  So let compare that with the E-M1 that I also have.  Color Depth, 23 bits, Dynamic Range 12.7 and Low Light ISO 757.  So the IQ is better  by 1.7 bits for Color Depth, .4 stop of dynamic range, and just under 2 stops of EV.  This is what DxOMark have to say regarding the scores: A color sensitivity of 22bits is excellent, and differences below 1 bit are barely noticeable and  A value of 12 EV is excellent, with differences below 0.5 EV usually not noticeable.  In low light situations, the Df is clearly superior with a 2 stop advantage.  However, for regular day to day good light shooting, the IQ is going to be pretty comparable between the 2.  I will be putting up comparison photos on my website.  The photos will be a comparison of the Nikon Df, Sony A7, Olympus E-M1 and Panasonic GM1.  EXIF will be stripped.If you have some old  non-AI lenses, this is the first body since the F5 which includes the feature to fold the indexing tab back and out of the way.  Very few people will need this feature but if you do, this is the only digital body to feature this.I really like the way this camera looks and feels.  However, the fact of the matter, is DSLMs offer a lot of nice features over DSLRs and I find myself rarely using my Nikon DSLRs.  Did the Df rekindle the Nikon love affair for me?  Does it make me want to put down my E-M1 and shoot the Df instead?  My answer right now is I don't know.  The E-M1 outguns the Df in a lot of aspects  except IQ and the difference is not as apparent as many would like you to believe.  However, while quirky, there is something emotionally satisfying shooting the Df.Pros16mp Sensor (To some extent this is the successor to the D700)Light weightSmallishGreat StyleConversation PieceStealth camera1400 Pictures from a small battery.ConsPrice (If this camera had included the D800 guts (focus capabilities, shutter speed, shutter longevity, etc) with D4 sensor, it would have been a logical and emotional purchase)One Memory Card Slot!!!Manual controls are quirky and slow to usePoor 1/4000 max shutter speedPoor 1/200 flash sync speedPoor 39 point centrally crammed focus pointsLow light focusing not as good as the D800 or D7100No video (I don't use this feature much but I don't see any reason to exclude it)Is this the right camera for you?

I still have my F-FTN, FE's, FE2's FG's and F6 and lined them all up with my new Df. Apples and oranges for sure, the Df in no way compares to any of my early Nikons from the 60's and 70's, in quality, build and will later, comment on the fit & function end when I have run it out a bit with all my Nikkor/Nikon lenses. For the $2900+ - dollars, the build was a bit of a let down but mixing the past with the present might be an offset, to a point. maybe! I also have the D700 and D800 models and have been spoiled by both in their build, function and quality, far superior in every way (MAYBE) but that said, I will not put this new child down or up until I have had some time to become familiar with it's unique form, fit and function. In closing at this moment, there is much to like and little to dislike, I'll be back with more soon and my advise would be to visit your local camera store and put one in your hands with a Nikon 70-200mm f2.8 VR, a Nikon Chubby-Stubby 200mm f2 VR or what ever lens you might have or want attached. You might just fall in love or...!V/RThe PhotogDog**Update** 12-4-13  Threw a saddle on it and gave it a good ride! \"Great Camera, glad I have it and will be using it along with my other Nikons. First impressions are not always my best ones but after using the Df for almost 2 days now have warmed up a bunch... The controls are mostly dual function and very easy to use, nice! The weight is right on at 1 lb. 11.4 oz. (Very close to my old F-FTN @ 1 lb. 15.2 oz. The balance is a bit off with the larger lenses but I mount my lens to my tri or mono pods anyway, so that is a non-issue. My Df is the all black model, very stealth in appearance and professional looking. Later on I might pick up the special edition chrome model (second hand of course) to have a pair because I like the looks of them both. I did the same with all my older nikons of the 60's & 70's, what the heck, I like Nikon cameras... The feel and look at first was a bit plasticity to me but after reviewing the build specs, I now know that the Nikon Team put together two very strong materials for a sound and sturdy camera body. I have tested the Df with my later vintage Nikkor lenses; AF-S 200MM F2 VR, AF-S 70-200MM F2.8 VR, AF-S 50MM F1.4, AF 50MM F1.8 and lastly for now, my AF 14MM F2.8D ED. All performed perfectly as expected with outstanding results. All the shots taken were outstanding (in my humble opinion) and in a way, have a bit of a look all their own based on a few comparison shots from my D700 and D800. Hard to put a finger on it this early in the game but I like the way they came out very much, interesting! I will be testing my early vintage 1960 and 70's Nikkor lenses later this month and will provide more feedback about how it went with them then.I must admit that this camera brought back feelings like a school kid with their first camera, put a smile on my face, ya it did and at 70 years young, that is saying something! I believe that this little Df is and will continue to be, \"A Nice Blast from the Past\", finding a place in our hearts, minds and of course, a tool well worth the effort to produce and use to further our love for photography. Like everything else, this Nikon will not be for everyone but for this old 70 yr-ole guy, I will enjoy the Df to it's fullest.As you may notice, I have left most the techie talk to the techie types, they do a better job of it than I can, anyway. I presented this Df Camera from more of a personal perspective and will reflect on more of the pros than the cons. Please note that this camera does not do Audio/Video (GREAT, get a video cam or use your cell phone). Does not have a built-in flash (GREAT, use the little Nikon SB400, it is a better flash than any built-in). Has no provision for a battery grip ( That is O.K. too, if back up power is needed, spare batteries, they cost less than a grip and this Df does not need a battery grip to increase it's frame rate per second, how bout that!). You have  both manual controls on the top deck where they belong and all the presets menus, buttons of the modern Digitals on the back side and inside where they belong (A very good thing, I think!! The view finder is great, bright and has everything there that I need. Live View, Info, Review and Menu etc. are on the LCD, where they belong... Speaking of the LCD Screen, my one gripe would be, \"No Provision for screen protection, Nikon Team, you missed this one, might think about it with the Df II update! Bottom line to date, I am very happy with my Df. Yes I would recommend this camera for the new to the Art of Photography folks and students (very uncomplicated camera with ease of use and the instructor can see at a glance what you are up to ;-) ). I would also recommend this to Amateurs as well as the Pro Photogs. Some times we we take life to serious and need to lighten up a bit with a new toy that performs very well, looks good and feels great in the hands.

In the right hands, that camera could produce amazing, artistic pictures, and this is the memory that came immediately to mind when I first saw the Df. These days, I'm fortunate enough to own a D4, a D800E and a D300, but the Df has earned a special place thanks to that retro look...I can't pick it up without being reminded of my (now deceased) father's Nikon F.In addition to the emotional angle, I use the Df a lot because it's unobtrusive and fairly compact with a smaller lens (to me, it feels awkward with any of today's monster zoom lenses - the extra heft of the D800E or D4 seem to \"balance\" better, even though the whole assembly is heavier). Most of the time, you'll find the 24mm f/1.4 mounted on it, although I just got the new 58mm f/1.4 and it seems the suit the Df quite well also.As for the construction details and so forth, it's about what you'd expect for a camera in this price range. I suppose it's rugged enough...but then again, the technology moves so quickly these days, I can't imagine keeping a digital camera for much over five years. Sort of puts it in different perspective than, say, my father's Nikon F that's still working fine nearly fifty years after it was built.The D800E is still the resolution champ, but few of us are willing to go through what it takes to use this camera to its potential. Top quality lenses, tripods, etc...it has a place if you need super-high resolution, but for day-to-day, I tend to prefer the D4 - it's somehow more \"romantic\" where the D800E is more \"technical\".One small point I'll mention is that even though the Df and the D4 share the same sensor, there's a very subtle difference in the pictures I get with the two cameras. I'm not sure if it's me or some technical aspect of the Df, but I've shot the two side by side with the same exact lens, subject, lighting and so forth - and yet, the D4 image almost always seems to have a bit more \"pop\" to it. Perhaps there's something in the software, but when image quality is the most important thing, I'm still reaching for the D4.That aside, there's a lot to like about the Df, from it's size to the controls to more minimalist feature set that feels \"right\" in your hand. Definitely worth a look.", "Date": "March 16, 2014"}, {"Title": "Reluctantly, I returned it", "Author": "Doctor.Generosity", "ReviewID": "R2I8FU62BTSTKE", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "Nikon has always been a bit more romantic than other large Japanese companies. They have repeatedly produced cameras which seem more about honoring their corporate history than revenue. In 2005 they made a limited production run of their SP rangefinder film camera from the 1950's; lovingly crafted in Japan and strictly for collectors. In 2004, after it was clear that film photography was over, they nevertheless lavished engineering development on the F6, the last ever Nikon film SLR. It is hard to believe they recovered their costs on this finely designed and precision built camera, whose production soon fell to fewer than 50 a month, worldwide. Making it was perhaps more a love letter to an SLR past than a business decision.So it may also be with the Nikon DF, designed half for function and half for nostalgia for Nikon's glory days of SLR. I probably perfectly fit the demographic Nikon had in mind; old enough to remember my Nikon F in the 1960's with fondness, and still with a shelf of Nikon lenses accumulated from that day to this.However, I am not in a position to spend $3,000 just for retro nostalgia. And while it's sweet that it can mount pre-AI lenses, I converted the last of mine 20 years ago. I bought the DF with the idea that if it turned out to work better for my type of photography, which is portraiture, I would sell my D600 to recover part of the cost. But after a few days of testing, I have decided to keep my D600 and return the DF. Here's why:The DF is undeniably cool. On paper it is only slightly smaller and lighter than the D600, but in hand it feels significantly more compact. As for the mechanical dials in place of menu items and plastic, they are precisely machined and satisfying to operate - but the only one I would actually use frequently is the ISO dial - I don't often find a need to set shutter speed independently. Although I do not care about video recording, the DF sacrificed two things I occasionally do need; an integrated flash and a wireless remote. Nikon omitted the internal flash in order to keep the classic 1970's sharp pentaprism housing, a decision I consider cosmetics over functionality. Also my D600 works with the tiny inexpensive ML-L3 remote but the DF requires an expensive and bulky electronics box to enable the same thing. Finally I was a bit disappointed that - at this price - Nikon did not put all their very best components into the DF. The shutter lag is short and snappy, but it is the same as the D600 - not quite as short and snappy as the D800 or D4 (or the D700, which actually had the shortest latency of any recent Nikon). Capturing the shot at the instant of pressing the trigger is a big part of portrait photography.It came down to the sensor for me. Using the 16 MP sensor from the D4, the DF seemed like a worthy successor to the D700 with its large pixels, fantastic low light sensitivity and brilliant colors. But it should be noted that the D4 itself is about to be upgraded with an improved sensor, so the DF will not even be state of the art in a few more months. I tested the DF sensor by comparing photo for photo with my D600 at ISO 6400. Results: Yes, the DF has lower noise and cleaner images at high ISO, and yes the images have a brilliant punch and saturation. But the differences are modest under typical usage circumstances, not night and day, and in the end were not sufficient justification to spend so much money.The Nikon DF is a bit of a style item, aesthetically appealing but differing from other Nikon DSLR only in handling preferences. Not being able to justify owning two full frame bodies, it doesn't offer new functionality that would lead me to replace my D600 and in fact loses some features I am accustomed to having. It reminds me of another extremely cool retro product from Japan, the Toyota FJ Cruiser, designed to look like a vintage J40 Land Cruiser from the 1950's. I loved the look, but when I drove it, the design proved impractical and I ended up with a less cool but more useful Honda truck.", "Date": "December 9, 2013"}, {"Title": "A very, very excellent camera!", "Author": "Amazon Customer \"ronjh@hotmail.com\"", "ReviewID": "R39QYXF4Q0K5B5", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I echo the positive sentiments of the most recent reviewers: pick one up, and if it feels just right ergonomically, then go out shoot and examine your files later and you'll be amazed at the quality.

Also I read a gazillion reviews before buying it and there are a few things I don't recall seeing mentioned that I thought others might want to know about.  I opened it last night and used it for a while walking around near dusk with the 24-70 2.8.  Here are my first impressions:(1) It feels solid and the small size is nice when in \"walkaround mode\" like I was doing yesterday.  When I picked up my big one this morning it felt awkward in comparison.(2) The images are great and the high ISO performance seems to be everything they say it is.  I don't think it will let me upload a sample photo but here is a link for one I took last night when it was getting dark, ISO 5000.  Tough to argue with that noise level.[...](3) A number of people expressed concern or dislike about \"balance\" with a modern zoom lens.  I was trying to understand what they were talking about but honestly I really don't get it.  To me it felt fine with this lens attached.  Maybe they meant if you wanted to hold it in one hand, which I never do anyway unless I have to reach for a very unusual angle I can't get to otherwise.  Seems to me best to use two hands at all times for maximum stability.(4) One annoyance - which I have yet to determine how much of an annoyance it is - is that the clips where you would attach the neck strap are angled toward the front like you would see on an old SLR.  I like to use a handstrap for those occasions when I do have to go one-handed and because of the angle of the clip the handstrap doesn't really stay on very well.  I think I might be able to tinker with it so that it works better.  Although I never used a handstrap with my old SLR it was never an issue.(5) As a lot of people have mentioned, there is only in SD card slot.  Although I personally have never experienced a card failure I've heard enough horror stories to be wary about relying on just the one card for a paid shoot.  I thought about this and decided on the balance I could live with it, since I will be using the camera either for personal/walkaround/street purposes - or as a second body for event purposes.  In the latter case I would have the big one with the 70 - 200 2.8 as my main camera and the Df  in a holster with the wide angle.  So worst case scenario it's not like I would lose everything.(5) There is no 1/750 shutter speed, which is a setting I use a lot.  For most action I use 1/1000 but if I have to cheat I go down to 1/750.  With the Df I would have to go down to 1/500 - but my thinking is that with the great high ISO performance it's kind of a wash.(6) The styling is relevant and irrelevant at the same time.  Personally I like the new/retro fusion idea in cars and I think it's fine but not a big deal one way or the other in a camera.  I've heard about people getting dirty looks from \"serious photographers\" when carrying this but I really don't worry about that sort of thing.  There might be a bit of an advantage with respect to the general public in that people sometimes have strange reactions when you point a big camera with a grip and big lens and lens hood at them.  This one might be more subtle and less likely to produce the annoying response that I must have a really expensive camera, implying that is why my pictures are better than the average person's.(7) The autofocus might have had a bit of trouble last night at dusk.  Will need to experiment more.(8) For me at least changing shutter speed with the dial on top is much faster and more intuitive than the other way.(9) I guess everyone uses the camera differently and for different purposes but for me being free of the built-in flash and video are like having a weight lifted from my shoulders.  I never use either of those features and it's great not to have to see them or deal with extra weight or settings.(10) On the balance I really like the camera.  It's a solid machine that feels great in your hands, similar to the way the old ones did.  I think it will be great as both a walkaround/street camera for personal day-to-day use and as a \"sidearm\" for professional event use.", "Date": "May 23, 2014"}, {"Title": "Amazing camera for pictures.", "Author": "Matt Stetson \"Point Blank Reviews\"", "ReviewID": "R297G9WVR1N63Z", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This is an absolutely amazing camera.

I have used it for around 8 weddings so far. I do like it but can't honestly say it deserves 5 starts, I almost put 3, but in the light that I don't regret buying it, I decided to go with 4.PROS:- the camera is beautiful, I've gotten many compliments from wedding guests and friends.- it's light and small. It doesn't look as pretty with the new (gold) Nixon lenses but it doesn't look ugly either.- the ISO is amazing, as you can see in the wedding I linked, I took several photos without a flash and they look fantastic.- the 16bit raw images have a greater range and a lot of flexibility, a good think in case you mess up your exposure really bad in a sudden change of light like it happens to a wedding photographer. Compared to my passed D700 this one has even more information and has let me save some before unsolvable photos.- the battery lasts a long time. Maybe a whole wedding, even a little more. I would get one extra battery, if your workload is really big maybe a third one but like a said, a wedding is around 3000 shots!CONS:- as many have said it, the focus at low light sucks, real bad. I wanted to do a high ISO group shots but couldn't because my camera couldn't focus. This being the strongest feature of NIXON is now a disappointment on the Df. The light was low, but not that low. I think not having an assistant light is the biggest mistake they made. MY SOLUTION: I programmed the fn button to \"no flash\" so I put on the flash on the camera, used the strobe's assistant focus (red light) and shoot while pressing the fn button to avoid actually triggering the flash when I shoot. Way to loose your vintage look... During the day and the C mode work very well.Another problem with the focus is flare, when you are doing a photo with the sun behind you (like in a beach wedding in the pacific) it also has issues to focus, THUMBS DOWN.- the speed dial keeps going round so if I'm in 4000 and go one more step, I get in to a completely different mode and mess up the exposure, if you are not a chimper this could be a serious mess up. That is actually how I messed up my exposures and had to save them in post.- The f dial is uncomfortable, so far I haven't look if it's possible to change the dial as I want to keep the \"vintage use\", I hope I'll get used to it.- the ISO dial has a really unnecessary button to be able to press it... Seriously??? Well... It seems all the dials are uncomfortable but one gets use to it.-  If you go for the 16bit, your files will be heavy, 22mb heavy. This means more memory, I bought 4 16g lexar pro, they fit like 400 photos. So I had to go ahead and buy a 64g, now a whole wedding fits in one card. The card is really expensive though. So I guess now I would have rather buying 32g cards to not put the work in one card.In conclusion, I wanted a cheaper option that had the awesome sensor and the high ISO I needed, I think this was a good buy, but the focus issue needs to be corrected, I can work around it, but still, being used to the great Nikon focusing system, way above than canon's in my opinion... Well, it sucks. I hope the next Df steps it up, I'll be the first to change my camera when it does.", "Date": "February 18, 2014"}, {"Title": "Takes some time", "Author": "B.

Brown", "ReviewID": "RRMH9HT160UFC", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "First off, fair warning:  I ordered a new Df body from Amazon.com.  What I received was a used copy, with no notification, for the same price as a new one.  Dust and pet hair, fingerprints, manual pages bent back and stained, and a old mangled lens cap in the box for no apparent reason (I ordered the body only).  The first photo I took with the camera was shutter actuation #597.  Now, given that this camera is out of stock most places and we're in the peak of holiday season, if I had been given the option to purchased a returned copy (at a discount) I probably would have.  Instead they sent me a camera that someone took almost 600 photos with to fulfill the order, without even giving me the option to wait for a new one.  Not too cool, Amazon.--Now, on to the camera.  To say that the Df is a strange little box assembled from mismatched parts is.. well, pretty accurate.  Whether or not the end result will work for you depends on how you intend to use it, what you're willing to compromise on, and frankly how much money you have laying around.  I'm going get the negatives out of the way first.Let's be honest, the ergonomics of the Df are not even close to on par with the rest of their DSLR's.  It's too light for its size.  The grip is too small.  The knobs are difficult to use one-handed.  It starts to feel unbalanced even with longer primes.. forget about putting a big zoom on this camera and handling it comfortably.  Now don't get me wrong, I do admire the overall design, and I do like having physical dials in front of me.  I've spent a good amount of time behind an FM, FE, and FM3a.  I understand and appreciate the aesthetic they were going for.  However, the modern SLR has evolved the way it has for good reason.. they are better to handle.  This is not a camera that you (or I, anyway) want to shoot all day if you're doing product, fashion, automotive, wedding, concert, etc. photography.  You'll be begging for a Dx00 by the end of the set.  They took a big step backwards in ergonomics with the Df to cash in on the \"retro\" craze that's going on right now.Next, no video.  Zero, not even a little bit.  Live view and 1080P HDMI out?  Sure.  Record it on the camera?  Nope.  I understand and even sympathize with the \"purists\" who may view this as a plus and ask what place video has on an SLR camera.  No mic, so less openings for water and dust to get in.  Less buttons to clutter the (already-cluttered) body.  I get it.  But in reality, the camera is capable of it already.  Even with no built-in microphone, they could have included a 3.5mm jack under a rubber door and had a video-ready camera like the rest of their line-up.  My D800 shoots great video on the rare occasion that I need it, so it's not the end of the world for me.  If this was going to be my only camera, I would think twice because of this.No flash.  Personally I will miss having wireless commander capabilities built in, but I've never used the pop-up flash on my other Nikons as an actual light source.  But again, this would make me twice about having the Df as my only DSLR.No 1/8000 shutter speed.  No big loss here in my experience, stop it down or use an ND filter.Overpriced.  Crippled.  Less features and same price as the D800, but not eligible for NPS consideration.  Huh?Now all of this is unfortunate, because under the hood is the closest Nikon has come to the D700 replacement that many of us have been waiting for.  The positive aspect of all of this mismatchery and \"retro\" design effort is that you end up with a relatively small, light, and discreet camera with the very impressive sensor from the D4.  It's an extremely capable camera, and doesn't look like much to the untrained eye.  See any review of the D4 for image quality details, but this thing is a low-light monster with great detail, noise and color saturation right up to ISO 6400, and beyond to a lesser degree.  Similar menu system and button layout as the rest of Nikon's DSLR's, so not much to relearn there.  Shutter dial and aperture can be controlled with the front and rear dials if you prefer.  The only new controls you're really stuck using are ISO and exposure compensation knobs, both of which are locking, and neither is particularly easy to access with the camera up to your eye.  Back to the ergonomics problem.In the end I'm not really sure who this camera is for.  It's too expensive to buy for its looks.  It's too crippled and awkward to handle for pro use.  I'm generalizing here, but I question who Nikon's target market is with the DF.  Personally, I have a D800 that I use (and love) for landscapes and macro photography, and a D300S that I use primarily for work and conditions where I don't want to lug around a $3k camera.  The Df offers better low-light capability than either of them in a small, lightweight body that's pretty unassuming and easy to use once you learn its limitations.Want to shoot at dusk and not worry about bringing your own lighting? Df.Landscape photo for a big print? D800.Stealthy low-light street, bar, or venue photography? Df.Prolonged studio, wedding or concert shoot? D800.You get the idea.  I find myself thinking of the Df as a 35mm replacement and the D800 as medium format camera.  I'm not sure if that's what Nikon had in mind, but it works for me.  It's not for everyone, that's for sure, but if you have a place for it and know what to expect, it will perform and not disappoint.  It's a weird little beast, who knows if there will be a Df2.  I think most of us would have much preferred a true D700 replacement (D4 sensor in a D800 body).

It will allow you to use your old glass (AI) lenses.  But, if you have been shooting digital through the many generations of Nikon D-SLR bodies, you will find this camera lacking in several ways.The appearance of the chrome body is cheap.  It feels like silver plastic.  The black body looks and feels much more like a metal camera body.  The new battery has a very long charge life, but why not use an existing battery from the DSLR line.  You will wait months now to get a second battery for this camera.  The battery is smaller and lighter weight, so I guess it's a trade off worth living with.The body is relatively lighter in weight and much slimmer than other Nikon D-SLRs at the higher end.  The 50mm kit lens is very solid, with a metal shell, and it is very light weight.  The image quality, as expected, is excellent.  Nice bokeh wide open.  All these are positives in my opinion.However, there is no protection for the LCD, unlike virtually every other Nikon D-SLR I've owned.  The only solution is to purchase an aftermarket cover -- far from ideal.  And, you need the LCD screen to shoot for many reasons, not the least of which is the very small screen atop the camera body.  It does not present all the usual data.  Minimalist info atop the camera, so you will need to use the big LCD on the camera back for all the important data.What else is missing?  Well, start with the absence of a built in flash.  Add to that the absence of video recording.  I can live without the latter, but the former is a great compromise.  It has a hotshoe and a PC sync, but it's missing is a built in CLS controller.  Yes, you won't be able to avail yourself of Nikon's creative lighting system without a controller, sold separately, or buying another CLS strobe, that you probably would rather not mount atop the camera body (but you will have no choice unless you move to radio control using the PocketWizard iTTL system for Nikon.  Expensive work-around.Next, the placement of the exterior controls is a bit bizarre to say the least.  The shutter speed dial is placed perfectly, but the other control locations require new learning.  You can learn them and it all works out okay, but, there is one serious issue.  The mode control, ISO control, and EV+/- control requires TWO HANDS to change.  You must depress a button with one hand, and turn the knob with the other.  Very inconvenient and slow.  How dumb was that?In sum, this is a camera design that has some really good features.  The ability to use older lenses should be incorporated into all of the higher end DSLRs in the Nikon line.  The ergonomics of the body are very nice overall.  The dual buttons to choose DX/FX and to preview depth of field are very nice.  It is irrational, but I like the camera and want to figure out how I can use it instead of my D800 or D610.  Sadly, if I do, it will be a big compromise for the excitement of retro-ness.This camera was rushed to market before the Christmas season.  It is a beta version of what could have been a really show-stopping camera.  Stay tuned.  Nikon may learn from the consumer response and build a better mouse trap next time.Yes, I bought the camera, for those who can't infer this from the above review.One addition to the review, the camera is also missing the 10-pin connector, which locks the camera out of using many legacy accessories.

It is so retro and light. But I need more than a pretty face for my camera gear.The first thing that surprised me was one memory card slot. Yikes! Not having a backup memory card is like not backing up your computer. It is just begging for problems. When I shoot with a high end camera, I always shoot in both jpeg & raw. I use my jpeg as a backup in case anything goes wrong with the raw memory card.The next problem I had with the camera is the battery compartment door fell off, and kept falling off.Next, an employee brought me the eyepiece that had fallen off when I took off the cover.The only camera profile available with the converted files is Adobe Standard. I've never seen a DNG that only has one camera profile available. No portrait, or landscape. That is a huge limitation.Yes, it's cute, it's retro, it's light, but so is my plastic Diana+. This camera cost me almost $3,000 and I would put it in the toy category. That is way too much money for a toy.Thank goodness I didn't sell my Nikon D4 16.2 MP CMOS FX Digital SLR with Full 1080p HD Video (Body Only), which yes, is heavy, but well made, has 2 memory card slots, several camera profiles for DNGs, and none of the pieces fall off.", "Date": "December 22, 2013"}, {"Title": "Hobbyist camera at pro camera price", "Author": "Doctor C", "ReviewID": "R1K0140QG4LNW", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "I got my grubby little hands on this camera to see whether it would change my opinion of the lack of features once I actually saw the camera and held it.  Perhaps the \"pure photography\" would make me see past the almost $3000 price tag and no video.  Perhaps I could see past having only one memory card slot.  Perhaps I would see past the lack of a pop-up flash.  It did not.It is a handsome camera, kind of what one's dad might have used in the 70's, but for many people shooting in the last 10 years, DSLR's are what they're used to.  The button placements and ergonomics weren't put on  a D800 camera because they wanted to be cool but rather because it gives the person shooting the fastest ability to change settings.  On the Df, somehow Nikon thought people want to pay more to be inconvenienced by using old time dials and knobs.  That means if you want to change the settings, you have to take your eyes off the viewfinder, look down at your camera, and change settings.Is it fair to compare this, what amounts to a hobbyist camera for those who want to say they are cool because their camera looks old to Nikon's 2nd flagship camera after the D4?  Of course!  They cost the same!  At that price point, the Df better be the best at everything but besides the D4 sensor in it, there is nothing appealing about a $3000 crippled camera that can't even shoot video when even the $1600 D600, oil spots and all has video and more features.The only way to make this camera work is to either make it a $1600 camera for those who already have their \"workhorse\" cameras, or to make it mirrorless camera that's smaller and truly something unique.  Not sure what Nikon was thinking with this one.  If they really wanted to make customers happy, they could have put this sensor on the D800 and called it D800s and then people would get their D700 replacement, but this....this just makes no sense.I \"get\" what Nikon was trying to do - play at the heart-string of old-timers who fondly remember their old Nikon film cameras and remind us that Nikon has been a solid camera company that links the past with the future (or something) but I think Nikon's priorities are misplaced.  This thing is rather big and bulky unlike the film cameras and adding a few steampunk dials here or there doesn't make something \"retro\".  It's a half hearted attempt.
