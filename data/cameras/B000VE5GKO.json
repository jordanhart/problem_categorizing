The lens on this is made by Leika, who've been making very high quality versions of such items for ages.It's a doddle to operate, is nice and light in the hand and has a nice large preview/review screen to see what you're about to shoot, or you've taken just now.I'm nowhere near knowledgeable enough about photography to make full use of all the features this item has to offer, but then I'd rather have more specifications than I can use, than miss out on ones that I want.Love the image stabilization feature, as it allows even me to take good photos without excess blurring.All in all, if you want a good general purpose camera, that's easy to operate and a great price, this would be a good pick.", "Date": "January 13, 2008"}, {"Title": "Panasonic DMC LS75S digital camera", "Author": "Laurence D.

The back is almost all screen so you really see he image before you shoot.  It is a best buy for the price and performance.  With a 1 gig SD card the camera will shoot about 250 pics at the best resolution which is more than enough. It has a built in lens cover so you can put it in a purse or pocket without scratching the lens.  I give it 5 stars. It is easy and fun to use.  the perfect camera to take anywhere.", "Date": "January 20, 2008"}, {"Title": "Feeling the Love for the DMC-LS75", "Author": "M. R. Reynolds", "ReviewID": "R2P2J8URW2JU7E", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Executive Summary:  I seriously doubt that you'll find any digital camera that can take any better, clearer outdoor pictures within this cameras price bracket.  I believe that this camera has basic point and shoot picture quality as good or better than many cameras selling for two or three times the price.First Impression.  Local office store had the camera for the Amazon price. I had a $10 off Wednesday only coupon that the cashier allowed me to use against the price mentioned above on Thursday.  First the technical stuff.  The DMC-LS75S has a 3X optical zoom plus 15 X digital zoom for a total of 18X.  3X optical zoom works for me.  If not I'll just step closer.  This camera will accept an SD memory card up to 2 GB (max) or an SDHC memory card 4 GB (min).  A 4 GB without an SDHC logo will not work. The camera uses two AA batteries (supplied).  The shooting modes are normal picture mode, simple mode, intelligent ISO mode, macro mode, scene mode, and motion picture mode.  It has a playback mode and a PictBridge print mode.  Using a 2 GB memory San Disk SD card (less than $20 locally) with default camera compression as a benchmark 7 MP = 550 pictures (slightly more in my camera), 5 MP = 790 pictures, 3 MP = 1220 pictures and so forth.  The camera appears to have the same electronic insides, other than zoom, and likely the same menu options that are probably contained in the more expensive Panasonics.  There's nothing much left out of all the menu options and some nice surprise options as well.  The camera was built in China and the operating instructions are clearly written.The only thing I didn't like about this camera is the flash.  It is way too strong for taking a photo an arms length away.  The only way around this I guess is to experiment with one of the many scene mode settings.How does the camera shoot outdoors?  I have uploaded some snapshots to Amazon with everything set in out of the box default mode.  The outdoor picture quality IMO is outstanding.  PQ on the DMC-LS75 is significantly better than my wife's Casio ultra slim 8 mp digital camera.Even though Panasonic's web site shows the DMC-LS75S is a feature reduced sister of the DMC-LS70S it's not true.  My DMC-LS75S has exactly the same features and menu options, despite what Panasonic says, as the DMC-LS70S.Second impression four months later:Indoor lower light shooting without a flash or indoor flash shooting at a distance gives you horrible blurry quality.  Even when holding the camera rock steady.  But for a camera that cost me $89 at a local office big box store what should I really expect.", "Date": "March 21, 2008"}, {"Title": "BZ@Ca", "Author": "Ben Zecha", "ReviewID": "RMTE1WCRCAMKG", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Very nice and solid feel,small camera.

I bought it probably about 3 years ago now at Big Lots for very cheap mostly for ebay. It has held up very well, and recently just discovered it does more than I knew about in the past, which just gave it more cool points. Namely, a 60 second minimum shutter speed option. This is not listed in most reviews of this camera, and like I said before, I never knew it had it until recently. This gives you the ability to take night photos using a tripod. There's no full manual settings, but gives you control in a few odd ways you wouldn't think. ISO is fully adjustable. The \"scene\" features are where you get a lot of control, different scenes give you different settings. The \"starry sky\" setting gives you to option to set a 15, 30, or 60 second shutter speed. This is really cool if you are interested in night photography. It automatically sets the ISO to 100 and produces decent results. Granted it's no DSLR, but at 7.2 mp with the highest resolution selected, it looks pretty darn good.Another nice feature is the ISO, capable of going from 100 all the way to 3200 in high sensitivity mode (this is also buried in scene mode) So you can take good photos inside without a flash. The portrait mode is a little weak, but not terrible. Macro mode works very well.The zoom feature at only 3x is a little weak, but not horrible. Battery life could be better, but over all its a very good camera for the money!", "Date": "December 10, 2011"}, {"Title": "Great bargain, excellent quality", "Author": "J.

Since I've waited five months to write this review, I can say that this camera has been used almost daily.  It's small enough where it's always in her purse, ready for pictures whenever our 4 year old daughter is up to something worth capturing.  She's used it indoors, outdoors, in darkness, at the beach, in bright sunlight, and photographing fireworks.  If there's a point-and-shoot situation, this camera has been there.  I have to say that it's really easy to take great pictures with this camera.  It operates smoothly, feels good in your hand, focuses well, and works with all our SD memory cards.  Definitely one of the best cameras I've ever purchased.", "Date": "October 7, 2009"}, {"Title": "nice cam", "Author": "Kerri-ann S.

Ross", "ReviewID": "R2H5AIL7UGRFWU", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I was looking for a cheap point and shoot for taking pics for Ebay. I'm a camera noob and wanted a camera that could do what a point and shoot should. I wanted to take it out of the box and snap pics. I started witha Sony DSC S700. I was extremely dissapointed. That camera has no image stabilizer. Unless you have surgeons hands, don't bother. This Panasonic does have an image stabilizer. The quality of pics it takes beats the Sony's hands down. You do need to read the manual. This camera has a boat-load of features. THere's multiple scene modes such as candlelight, beach, snow, sports etc. There's a macro mode for close-up shots. It has a movie mode for short filming. The Sony's shutter button required too much effort, and caused camera movement, the Panasonic's does not. Press half-way to focus, and full to snap. There's a high angle mode. That makes it easier to see the large lcd screen when holding the camera above your head. Zooming in and out is easy with a separate button on the top of the camera. When shooting, an icon tells you if your hand is moving to much, so you can attempt to stabilize the shot. The image stabilizer works well. You can navigate easily thru the menus. When turning the jog dial, the lcd screen indicates what mode your in. The camera takes fairly good low-light pics. There is some graininess, but it's not too bad. You will want to spend more if you plan to take a lot of night-shots tho. The onboard photo-editing is limited. Red-eye removal, crop, rotate and that's about it. There's a shooting mode that eliminates red-eye by pausing the shutter after the flash goes off. It works very well. The included software is very basic, serious photographers will want 3rd party software. There's Intelligent ISO(in shutter opening) mode which will automatically enable or disable the flash based on ambient light. Very handy! If the flash causes glare, you can force it off easily. There's a wealth of info on the lcd screen. There's a pictograph of incoming light to help you avoid glare,etc. Indicators for OIS on, # of shots on the memory card etc. I paid $90 for this camera. For that kind of money, it's a screaming bargain. On the Sony, you have to go to nearly $200 to get an image stabilizer. The OIS on this camera is indespensible. I love this camera, an recommend it highly to anyone wanting a budget model. That being said, this isn't a professional camera, so if that's what you want look elsewhere.", "Date": "September 19, 2008"}, {"Title": "ALL YOU NEED", "Author": "J.
