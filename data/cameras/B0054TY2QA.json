{"Reviews": [{"Title": "WOW look no further! This is the one!", "Author": "Marc Leydecker \"Belga\"", "ReviewID": "R1M1D4HBUGO9XW", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This is my second EasyN F-series camera.There are about 52 camera brands made in China. There are of course not 52 camera factories in the same town...The most common and pricy brands are FOSCAM, SISCO, SONY, HITACHI, D-LINK, AXISAll of these (in the affordable price range) have their Pro's and Con's.The EasyN caught my eye as it had the most useful features and most advanced technology for the price.The company must be fairly new and very few reviews are available.The EasyN seems to be a combination of BRAND NAME parts.I can testify that the EasyN uses a FOSCAM control board as I can connect and control the camera with FOSCAM's software.Why is it better than the rest?* None of the other IR cameras give True-Colour pictures as the IR LED's are always ON.So the greys' look purple, the greens look blue and the whole picture looks washed out in full sunlight. The darker it gets, the better those cameras (colour-wise) perform.Those cameras can not provide video in complete darkness as they are a compromise for dark and light situations.The EasyN has some IR mechanical filters!In full sunlight, the IR is blocked by some filter. When you move the cam into the dark, you can hear some clicks and the IR filters are removed. The result is remarkable.My garage is lit with 2 Hi intensity LED's at the light switch. The rest of the garage is pitch-black. I attached a picture of the garage taken at night. WOW (camera functions in <0.3 LUX)* Auto shutter speed: 1/50s(1/60s) ~ 1/100,000 s* 32Bit RSIC Embedded Processor.* Microsoft CERTIFIED ActiveX controls!* The EasyN comes with a 3.6mm lens. Most cameras come standard with a 4mm lens. The 3.6 mm which has a wider view-angle, also gives you a lot greater depth-of-field. This also means that objects in both close and distant range look crisp.* You can adjust the focus on the EasyN on the front of the lens. Most other cameras in that price range have a factory fixed focus.* The EasyN also broadcasts audio and has a build-in microphone.* The EasyN has an external audio jack so you can use it as a 2-way radio!* The EasyN has external alarm inputs and outputs, so you can connect other alarms (fire, burglary, etc.) to the device.* The hardware is superb and has a very intuitive bracket which allows you to hang or mount the thing virtually anywhere.* The wireless (with removable standard antenna) is sensitive enough. I connect to my router from my workshop to the house with no problems. (60 ft. going through inside and outside walls)* It is powered by a universal 5V power supply.* The blinking connection and alarm LED's can be disabled or brightness adjusted in its BIOS.* Its BIOS (firmware) is impressive.  For a non-geek maybe too overwhelming. It looks like the pages on a DD-WRT router. You have pages to forward alarm emails, port forwarding, DDNS, brightness, contrast, Chroma, saturation, auto gain, etc.* The EasyN comes with FREE DDNS service. The registration # is the serial # of the device. (not very clear in the manual)* You can place a virtual grid over the \"picture\" and turn each square into a \"movement\" alarm zone.* Alarms can also be activated by sound. Both the movement and sound sensitivity can be controlled.The video quality is unsurpassed. I own a very expensive security system but compared to the EasyN, that system is junk.Installation:My first EasyN came with a mini-CD and a paper manual.The second one came with a full-size CD and no paper manual.The CD has English instructions translated from Chinese .... Do I need to say more?Luckily the CD also contains 3 videos on how to setup the system. Very helpful.Once you struggled setting up the beast, you will realize that you could have done it in 5 minutes.In a nutshell:Connect the camera via Cat5If your router is 192.168.0.1 set the camera to per example 192.168.0.169Select a port for the camera per example 81Type in your browser 192.168.0.169:81 and the camera works.Now go into the camera and let the camera find your Wi-Fi networks.Select the SSID, put in the password for the SSID, disconnect the cat5 and the beast works wireless.To connect from an external PC you need to know the IP assigned by COX (or other provider)Per example 169.45.3.33Type in 169.45.3.33:81 and you should see the camNO, YOU DON\"T !!!In order to access the camera from \"outside\" you need to enable port-forwarding on port 81 (as in this example the camera is using port 81)SIMPLE isn't itThere are tons of FREE phone apps on the market.I downloaded both  IP Cam Viewer Lite and TinyCam Free Monitor for android.These apps work like a charm and can even control the PTZ (movement of the Cam)Although the highest resolution of the CAM is 640 X 480, I noticed some lag when I'm not in a 3G zone. Switching the mode to 320 X 240 seems to be ideal for Phone use.Software:The camera comes with a slew of well-designed and useful software, including alarm controlled recording software.Packaging:Well packed. Too well packed !!!Do NOT throw away the Styrofoam.The mounting bolts and screws are IN-between two layers of Styrofoam.Clever as it prevents scratching the camera during shipment but if you are not careful, you might have thrown half of the hardware in the trash.Customers support:Superb although there is a language barrier.Conclusion:If the unit would have come with a well written manual in \"reel Englis\", I could have marketed this camera for triple the price under a known brand!", "Date": "September 6, 2011"}, {"Title": "Yes and No", "Author": "tjfitz", "ReviewID": "R3NLVNCSRD4Q3V", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "ok.. how do I say this. All 3 stars I give here are for the camera itself. The camera alone is 5 stars. Picture quality at 640-480 is very sharp and the image is really nice, FPS could be a bit better but it is really not bad at all. the automatic IR for darker areas is also good. IR LED's make for a very usable view of a dark room. Pan and Tilt are smooth and nearly silent. Wired works, Wireless works. 110~220 V power adapter is also a definite plus. The additional mount for wall mounting could really use a rubber washer for grip but is also above average in its design.BUTWhere this camera really bombs is in its software and online resources. The CD it comes with ONLY has on it the discovery and camera config software. And in that, I does what it should I guess. The Korean English is humorous at times, but it gets you there. but other than the discovery software.. there is nothing. The camera seems to have it's viewing software built in which it kicks off when you finally get to the cam itself. Please note.. I said Viewing, not recording, not 2-way audio, not 64 channels (other cameras?) Just Viewing.. That one camera.According to the website, there is a 90Mb Installation CD. Which I had hoped would have this amazing software which gets my camera (and the 2 others I bought with it) up and rolling with the two way comms, switching back and forth between cameras and maybe even recording to my PC...um... No.I have tried to download the 90Mb Installation CD (which must be different from my 10Mb CD in the box)The Site page says it's 90Mb, when IE or Chrome starts downloading, they say it is 76Mb.. and the site only gives it up at 1 or 2 Kbs.. means it wants to download for the next 10-14 hours.. but eventually drops out having only downloaded between 3 and 7Mb. But now I also know from examining the incomplete RAR file, that the bulk of the file is a 63Mb video.. which means the rest of the data is probably only the 10Mb of software I already have..SOCamera is a B+/A- and if you are looking to expand your current setup.. Go for this cam.. but if you are looking for this to be a package deal right out of the box?? not a good idea.", "Date": "December 16, 2011"}, {"Title": "I like the true Foscam better", "Author": "RandyO", "ReviewID": "R3LML1Q7OCYL7J", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "Ok so I own 8 cameras 5 Foscam and 3 of these..Considering these are likely made by the same factory, the specs are not the same. These cameras do have an autoswitching IR and cut filter that improves the image during the day and likely saves a little power during the day, the mounting brackets have been sacrificed in the process.  Where the Foscam mounting bracket seems fairly decent, these are pretty lousy.  May as well cut some fiber washers now so that when you get the device, you can fix the things.. just terrible tolerance stack up and sloppy sloppy fitment.That said, the image quality is pretty much the same between the two although these seem a bit less washed out in daylight colors.Also, these are going to be a bit nicer if you have peripherals you need to control as well as there is provision for additional devices to be controlled.  I will have to dig deeper in to that function as it is poorly documented in the instructions.Overall for a sub $100 camera, they are nice..  Setup is somewhat improved but you do need a NIC configured to run the 192.168.1.XX network as they come statically configured at a 192.168.1.126 on port 81 (this is noted on the bottom of the units and that is rather considerate)If you are running these \"wired\" and your network is already running 192.168.1.XX you are pretty much set. Plug and play..Another nice feature for those that need it is the dynamic DNS function pre-installed and configured for newbs.. takes all the guess work out, plug and go!Wireless setup is pretty easy, turn on radio, scan for network (twice please), click the one you want, enter the key and go.. when the unit goes to reboot, unplug the network cable and the wifi will hook right up..  pretty darn simple.Finally, to access these cameras outside your local network, you MUST configure the router to allow traffic over the assigned port on the camera (port 81 is default)Routers vary and some will do all this in a a single step (open a port and assign traffic to the correct IP) Others require a service added (port open) and then forward traffic to the correct IP (ALSO each camera MUST have a unique IP and Port number)..I spent maybe 10 minutes setting up the three of these and getting them online (wired and wireless)UPDATE:  While I still like the foscam version of this unit, this one goes on my DO NOT BUY list..Mail settings:  borked..  something in the firmware corrupts the logon procedure and I am not going to fix myself.. (Foscam works fine btw)User Interface: Broken (is in the software, or all cameras are equally broken)SUPPORT:  While I was able to contact them, I had to wait for a call back to speak with someone that spoke broken english at best..  I was then asked to downgrade my T.Viewer so that they could access my system..

Didn't cooperate at first though....", "Author": "OpAmp", "ReviewID": "R1V17C2A20L6CJ", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I gave it four stars, because it gave me some bad impressions at first, which can make the camera appear broken to most people.When I first got the camera, nothing worked properly. The EasyN app couldn't detect it when connected to the router, but could detect it when connected directly to my PC. So I tried configuring it that way, but for some reason, the app couldn't communicate with or \"access\" the camera to change the settings apparently. I used the manual method and changed the IP and that seemed to work to some degree, meaning that the IP changed, but the app still couldn't communicate with the camera to configure everything else.At this point, I tried logging into the camera through IE and sure enough it appeared to be working. I could see and hear using the camera, however, when I would try to modify almost any setting in the WebUI, I would constantly get an error \"Illegal params\" or something. I thought the camera was broken and wanted to return it.At this point, I made one last attempt. I used the reset button as described in the manual and successfully reset the camera to factory defaults. Suddenly, the app could see the camera through the router and was able to access it! It configured it pretty quickly and now everything works fine! The picture quality is great, especially at night. It has a lot of options to mess around with too, so you can do a lot of nifty things with it.The WebUI could be better. It feels slow and poorly put together, but it is functional. The camera can't pan down, but it's a none issue to me, since you can just mount it upside down and then flip the image in the WebUI. This is how most security cameras are installed anyways.I think this camera will cause some headaches for most people during the initial setup, because it will refuse to work properly at first. I don't know what the solution for me was, but definitely keep messing around with it, reset it, and it will eventually start working. Weird, I know.Overall, this is a great camera....once you get it working.", "Date": "December 16, 2011"}, {"Title": "Instructions suck but I managed to get it to work", "Author": "Peter J. Paschal", "ReviewID": "R2MULJVGVU1E6I", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "Like the title says, the instructions for set up suck. I spent three days getting the wifi to work properly. Maybe its and end user problem or maybe the Engrish techie instructions has something to do with it. Once I got the wi-fi working it worked like a charm on my home computer but I have yet to figure out how to make the darn thing connect to my iphone. I have tried several diffrent apps but no luck thus far. I've been trying to figure that part out now for three weeks. The product does work and it does have a good picture and controls via my computer work nicely. It's just a pain in the ass to get it to that point. The tech support from the maker of the product has a couple of videos and tutorials but they are not so helpful. If you write to the tech support or try to call, you are wasting your time. They do not respond. This product is probably made by a sweatshop in China and they really don't care about customer support. I would suggest purchasing a more expensive product were you can at least make sence of the instructions and have an 1-800# tech support you can actually talk with.", "Date": "December 27, 2011"}, {"Title": "Thought I'd finally found someone who provides support.  I was wrong", "Author": "Wesley L Lathan", "ReviewID": "R1JUJ21PFZZIW5", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I've purchased several of these Foscam based cameras in the last year.  There is a small but viable market for this kind of camera in my area.  The difficulty with all of these cameras is trying to get support when they malfunction.  Out of the 8 that I've had in this line, 2 have had the same trouble.  The wireless just stops functioning.  In each case (different importer and brand name, same Foscam underneath) I went round and round with their support only to get \"well if you use the Foscam paid support at the cost of $59.95 they'll help you get it online\".In the case of this particular implementation, their website indicates they provide the following guarantee \"Includes one year replacement warranty including parts and labor serviced out of Houston\" and \"RMA returns and replacements processed out of Houston\".  Their support section includes \"Full technical support by our support team via email\".  Their support team appears to be one guy with a Gmail account, not a good sign.  So far all I've gotten from them is the same response, pay Foscam for support.The bottom line with all of these Foscam based cameras, and all of them near this price point are Foscam under the hood, is this.  When they work, they work sufficiently.  When they fail, if the return time to Amazon has passed, you might as well throw it a way and buy another.  With a failure rate of 25% the odds are in the house's favor.This is the last one I'll attempt from EasyN and the last Foscam based product I'll try.", "Date": "January 12, 2012"}, {"Title": "Tricky setup. Sound? - maybe... Amazing video for the money.", "Author": "Thomas Colby \"Tom\"", "ReviewID": "RID2PJUNMI4N5", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "If I can finally get around to doing the research and getting the audio working, I will absolutely LOVE this little camera.  It did take me more than one evening to \"hit upon\" what I needed to do to get the web video capabilities working properly.  There is a hit or miss learning component to configuring the settings.  The user interface is unpolished, (which I guess we should all be getting used to these days. :-))  When you get the initial setup completed using the ethernet cable, UNPLUG it and go wireless!  I struggled for hours thinking I could use this camera with a wired connection.  I think the problem is that there is no way to tell the camera NOT to use the wireless.  Maybe it would have worked with a wired connection if there were no wireless router to connect to.  In any event, it worked great once I tried just going wireless after doing the initial setup.  The only problems are not being able to get the audio channel working and having the camera reboot from time to time, (which I attribute to my erratic cable broadband integrity.)  It is slow to reboot, but at least it eventually resumes working, instead of just \"going south\" and locking up, requiring someone to unplug and reconnect to clear the problem.  For what I want it for, this thing is THE answer.I have a friend who lives 1400 miles away and it was so cool to let him control the webcam and view my living room while we chatted on the phone.  If you are going to operate a camera in normal lighting conditions, spend the extra money for the IR cut feature on this camera.  You can hear it cycle on and off, so I conclude that it must be a physical shutter of some sort.  When it does cycle, as soon as the camera is \"seeing\" enough illumination to operate without the infra-red filter, the color quality goes from everything looking slightly green and a little washed out, to brilliant, vibrant \"natural\" colors.  It is like a breath of fresh air for your eyes! (do eyes LIKE fresh air?)  Anyway, the IR LEDs on the camera will illuminate my living room in near total darkness, well enough to allow the camera to provide images that are slightly grainy and greenish tinted, but quite impressive, at least to me, especially when you consider that, with my naked eye, I can't really see anything in the room except for shapes.  In good lighting this thing has a spectacular picture for this price, and quite possibly better than many more expensive cameras.In conclusion: If you can \"tinker\" with the deplorable user interface and learn a few of the quirks of the software, this is a fantastic camera.  I don't know how well the audio works, so I can't review that feature.  I would love to know if anyone has the \"two way\" sound working correctly.  The difficulty I am having may just be the pathetic camera control software that came bundled with this camera.  Software = Poor, Hardware = Great.", "Date": "March 30, 2012"}, {"Title": "Mother-in-law Cam", "Author": "R. Cross \"LVWolfman\"", "ReviewID": "ROHCP8FEJFZ0S", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Mother-in-law CamNo, this isn't for an adult voyeur website, but a way to monitor my mother-in-law who is elderly and has limited mobility.  She passed out twice in the kitchen of her house last week and of course she fell both times.  This would also be great for when she messes up her TV remote control.  I'll be able to have her on the phone, pan the camera to see her TV, cable box, etc. and tell her what to do to get things back on track, all without having to drive across town to her house.When she lived with us, I had an infrared camera mounted on the wall of her bedroom so I could monitor her while at work, but it required a computer, video capture card, etc.So, I researched state of the art in IP cameras and while I'd prefer an Axcis, I could buy 16 of these for that price.I've had Cox Communications turn on her cable internet at the lowest tier which should be enough, I don't really need TV quality, live streaming video.  I'm going to preconfigure an Apple Airport Express with this camera and it'll be plug and play when I take it over to her.The EasyN iPod/iPhone/iPad app (free) didn't work for me.  However, I spent a few dollars (very few) and bought the uFoscam app from the app store and it works great on both my iPhone 4 and iPad 2.While made of plastic, this camera is even better than I hoped.  The quality actually feels high, especially for this price point.  It also came with a very nice mounting bracket suitable for wall mounting.Setup:There is a sticker on the bottom of the camera with the preconfigured static IP address, DDNS address (for access via the internet), etc.  Ignore it as it is a lie.First, none of the software provided by any manufacturer would find this camera.After spending six hours or so trying to access this camera at work, reading Foscam, Agasio and EasyN forums (and excellent tips here) I didn't get it to work.  I set it up at home and once again, ran a 3rd Party IP scanner (Angry IP which runs on OS X, Windows and Linux.  It's free, Google it.) and found it not on 192.168.1.126 port 81 like the sticker said, but on 192.168.1.5 port 80.  And yes, this was after I did a hard reset to ensure it was on factory defaults.Rather than the static IP on the label, it was preconfigured for DHCP meaning that the routers gave it an IP address on boot up.  The reason I couldn't find it at work was probably because we already had a computer on whatever IP address was assigned. (As in a coworker picking one without consulting me.)Once I had the correct IP, I was able to bring up the web interface in Safari on my Mac and all was good to go. (The default user is admin and the default password is blank.)Usage:The web interface is very nice allowing you to configure most anything about this camera that you'd like, from a static IP to a dynamic (DHCP) one, etc. down to preset \"views\" so that with the right software, you can tell it to move to 7 and it'll pan and tilt to that preset position.  It even supports multiple accounts (admin or regular) each with their own passwords.  So both my wife and I can check on Mom, even at the same time as up to ten people can use this camera at a time.The infrared night vision works extremely well.  With the camera sitting on our breakfast bar at night, with only the bar lit up, we could see into the dark family room on one side and the dark kitchen on the other after having the camera pan.  The walls are about 10-15 feet away from the bar and there was no difference in quality or visibility whether the bar light was on or off.  It LOOKED like the room lights were on whether or not they really were.  Of course, everything was black and white.I read in one of the reviews that I can go into the BIOS and disable the big, blinking green light on the front.  I've yet to find out how to do that.  It is VERY distracting.  The infrared LEDs do not have any kind of filter or lens over them, so when they're on, you can see the red glow, though it is more obvious to my wife than to me.  Between the two types of light, this is NOT a stealth camera.EDIT 3/24/2012:  When logged into the web interface, go to PTZ settings and set \"Indicator Display Mode\" to \"Been extinguished\". That will turn off the annoying blinking green LED.The two way audio system is very weak.  There IS a jack for an external speaker on the camera and if you wish to use this for two way audio, you'll need it.  The mic isn't the best either but I didn't buy this for the audio.Summary:  This is an excellent IP camera for the money.  Once you get past the initial setup difficulties, the camera is awesome!  I WILL be buying more.  I'll finally be able to set up the home surveillance system on our half acre that I've been wanting.  The camera itself is worth a solid 5 stars at this price.  I'm knocking one off due to the poor software, poor documentation, factory configuration vs label discrepancies and that I didn't get the make and model that I ordered.Not Tested Yet:  Email/FTP, Motion Detection, DDNS and 64 channel recording softwarePros:  Solid, very quiet, excellent night vision, good color in minimal lighting.  Wide range of motion, nice features and excellent price.Cons:  I ordered this Agasio M166i model from EpicVideo (fulfilled by Amazon), but got shipped the equivalent model by EasyN.  They are identical except for the brand and model number, but supposedly Agasio has better technical support.  And you'll probably need it.  The green flashing LED is distracting, the instructions and included software are poor, even by Chinese standards. (The software for setting up your camera is in Chinese.  There IS a pull down menu to select English, IF you know to look for it as it is labeled in Chinese.)", "Date": "March 23, 2012"}, {"Title": "Works OK but I returned it", "Author": "W.

I spent 16 hours trying to set up the camera with slow progress. I finally had to call a friend to come help me on the 4th day of trying to set it up. Now that I can connect to the camera while I am at work, I have now discovered from the company and several more hours lost trying to figure it out, that in order to see the \"talk\" and \"listen\" (mic and speaker) button in the navigation pane on your computer, you must be running Internet Explrere 6! I was able to see the buttons on IE8 but unable to see if they functioned as I was using my home computer without a mic. When I went to work, using IE9 (something you can't change unless you are an administrator of the company's network), I could load the navigation pane and see the \"talk\" and \"listen\" buttons, but the camera could not connect (you just see blackness). Then, IE crashes after about 5-10 sec. According to the manufacturer, these features only work on IE and only work on version 6 (now 3 versions old), but of course, they do not tell you that until you have spent over a week working on it and succomb to having to email their support. What a waste.My other gripes: 1) The Easyn app they recommend in their documentaion does not work. Not even a little. You cannot logon. 2) The camera makes small clicking noises when it is being panned or when something comes into its view. Not the best if you are trying to conceal that there is a camera. 3) The camera cannot pan down, meaning that when the lens is facing directly forward, that's as low as it goes. So if you want to see anything close to the ground, your camera has to be standing close to the ground. 4) I was never able to get the camera to email me notifications and recordings when the motion detector alarm went off. I was using gmail and used all the settings they recommended but it never worked. 5) When using my home computer, the motion alarm would send the recordings to my shared folders, and I could not ever figure out how to get them to go to a different, more convenient folder. 6) The how-to videos they provide would not play on my computer. They suggested installing a new component to the program I was using. That never worked either  7) Using the browser on an iphone to view the camera is too slow to see anything but still motion frames, skipping time. Trying to pan or tilt the camera are equally as jerky.I saw other reviews about how challenging this camera can be to set up but I was all about suffering through that to have a great functioning camera. Unfortunately, those feaures did not live up to expectations. Having to do it again, I'd get a less appealing camera to save me the past 7 days of aggravation and now a return process.", "Date": "December 16, 2011"}, {"Title": "Works pretty good,,Crappy product and no support the the item.", "Author": "John", "ReviewID": "RF8G76P96Y3H0", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I received this product ahead of projected delivery date.

After receiving this camera, I realized that the CD that came with it was broken and unusable, but you really don't need it. Once I plugged it in via Ethernet cable and had the initial settings programmed in, getting it on the WiFi was a breeze. Then came the challenge.No matter what I tried, I just couldn't get the camera on the internet to view with the Foscam Surveillance Pro app for my iPhone. I got a dynamic DNS host for external viewing, but banged my head against the wall trying to figure out why it wasn't working. After about 4 hours of doing it myself, I turned to Google. Tried various solutions from different websites, but nothing seemed to work. Then a solutions came:For those of you with Clear Internet and either the \"M\" or \"G\" series modems, go to here to set it up:[...] (Do a Google search and type in \"Clear modem ip camera\" and look for a link that starts with austexvoip. Should only be a couple from the top of the search results.)Apparently, these modems are BOTH a modem and router, so you need to set it up correctly in order to forward all of it's ports to your router.

I found installation took a bit longer than I originally anticipated, but I'm not a real technical person, so I can't really say it was the camera setup - it could have just been that I'm not the greatest at that sort of thing.  Nothing insurmountable, but just another 20 minutes more than I bargained for.The images are super clear, I feel much more secure having this in place - I've got it in our vestibule area - since it's not an outdoor all-weather camera, and it's nice to be able to keep an eye on the place remotely.

As soon as I started running this camera over WiFi from my garage to the other side of the house, the two different model remotes' (with good batteries, garage door closed) range went from about 30 feet to 10. This means our vehicles have to practically touch the outside of the garage door for the driver to activate the opener.No matter what distance and/or elevation I put between the opener's receiver antenna and the camera's antenna (even tilting the antennas at various angles to change the radiation pattern, and attempting to extend the opener's receiver antenna from center of garage to just above the door), the camera still finds a way to jam it. The only consistent way to bring the garage opener's range back to normal is to unplug the camera.The manufacturer claims FCC certification of some unknown type and has the FCC logo on the box; it's hard to believe the the FCC certified this camera for Part 15 operation, since it appears to be a massive spurious emission generator.
