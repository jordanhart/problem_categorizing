As with everything I review, I use an item for several months to truly evaluate how good it is after the \"new\" purchase feeling has died down and I want to evaluate performance and not emotions for my new toy.This camera is simple to review.  It is very well made.  It is a good looking camera.  You expect big things. But...What you get it is horrible images.  I used it all through the Christmas and New Year holidays (2008) and was disappointed in its pictures.  If this is your first camera in this arena you might not be able to tell and think the images look fine, maybe even great.  However, owning several high end DSLR's, and having used several \"point and shoots\" as quick grab backups, I can say the images aren't good. They are grainy.  The colors are poor and muted in many instances.  Low light pictures are terrible, bordering on horrendous.  This camera is nowhere near as sharp as my Canon SD900 was and makes me even sadder I lost it.  In the end, aren't the pictures what the camera is all about regardless of the nice construction?  My experience was such that I returned this camera and got a new Canon SD1100 IS which performs as I expect a point and shoot to perform.  Not perfect, but great images for what you are using it for.Pros: Well built with nice construction.  Decent battery life.  Good looking camera.Cons: POOR IMAGES.", "Date": "February 25, 2009"}, {"Title": "Nice features, mediocre picture quality", "Author": "Scuba Von", "ReviewID": "RZSP7WTCDFB7T", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "I bought this as a gift for my wife to supplement a 4-year-old, bulky Canon A95 digital camera.

I was a little iffy when buying because of some bad reviews I had read when looking to buy. It ended up being a GREAT purchase! It replaced my Kodak C875 that broke. I took this to Orlando when my husband and I went to Disneyworld and we have a wonderful album full of great pictures! I also take alot of outdoor pictures when I see a beautiful sunset or scenery, and I also take alot of pictures of my doggies. This camera captures great colors! There is alot of extras with this camera, all kinds of different functions, just make sure you read the user manual and it will definitely help you better understand the camera. I love the different settings! If you want to take a picture without the flash in a semi-dark room and you want to capture all of the colors that you are seeing, just put the camera on the \"food\" setting and it captures absolutely GREAT pictures! Pictures that my Kodak was not capable of.I am very happy with my purchase & I will definitely buy a Nikon again!I will be posting a few sample pictures I have taken with this camera.UPDATE!!It has been a little over a year since I got this camera.

No matter what setting I try, the flash on the Nikon is wrong (including the auto flash) and the pictures are continually underexposed or overexposed.

Gray \"Semi camera savy\"", "ReviewID": "R1VHXU7GQEP8F4", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I bought my Coolpix S560 on line in June to take on a family trip to Colorado in July. I hadn't used it twice when I noticed the battery lid cover at the bottom of the camera housing wouldn't stay closed! I had removed the battery one time to recharge it, and was careful not to force anything back in where it didn't belong. I was sure to insert the battery into the slot and to place the little orange spring-loaded flange that keeps it down back over the battery properly. So there I was at Rocky Mtn. Nat'l Park asking a park ranger at Alpine visitor center for a rubber band to wrap around the camera housing to keep the dang plastic battery cover closed! In desperation I used the rubber band make-shift \"repair\" until I got home to contact Nikon repair in New York. After I found out how to ship the camera to them, about 10 days later I got an email response it would cost me around $55 plus shipment back to get this malady repaired. When I wrote back to find out why there would be a charge for what I believed was an obvious design flaw to this camera, their reply was the damage HAD to be from an external force as they had received NO prior reported problems with this camera.  Bull hockey! In a very weak moment, I relented and approved the repair as what other cheaper option did I have? $75 later (did I say I had to pay P/H costs to have it shipped back?). O.K. about a month after first contacting Nikon of this flaw, I had my Coolpix S560 back. Three months later we went on a Caribbean cruise, and guess what? This poor excuse for a camera had the exact same problem occur to its ultra cheapo plastic lip  that is supposed to hold the battery cover down. It doesn't!  Do not waste your money on this or any Nikon camera costing less than $200 is my advice! I am not even going to contact Nikon repair to only receive their same lame excuse for not repairing their cheaply-designed and made Coolpix camera! That would result in me paying more in repairs than what this camera originally cost me this June.P.S.: Guess what, Nikon?

The camera took beautiful pictures of vineyards and mountains and ocean scenes--all on bright sunny days. It wasn't until I tried to take pictures at a friend's wedding that I became disappointed. The mood lighting of the ceremony matched with the measly flash was too much for the camera to handle. All the pictures came out dark despite my close proximity to the altar. Maybe someone with more photography/camera knowledge could monkey with the settings to get a better picture. I tried changing ISO settings to no avail.

My toddler drooled on it, chewed on it, pressed on the lens, and even took it for a swim (I think she was going for underwater pictures...). It still works, and it works the same as it always has.

Hoelck", "ReviewID": "R2SJYL9FT5DF7C", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "I've owned several budget point-and-shoots like this, and I am well aware of their limitations. I'll compare this to other similar cameras that I've owned.As far as the construction is concerned, it's a sexy, solid device. It's got an enormous LCD display, great optical zoom for a P&S;, and it's small enough to carry comfortably in a pocket or on your wrist.One downside of the design: no viewfinder, so you're stuck with the LCD, which can be really tough to see in direct sunlight.The features aren't great. I'm pretty well versed in Photoshop, so gimmicky features like sepia tone and red-eye reduction aren't things I'd ever use. On the practical side, you can adjust the exposure, manually set the focal point, easily change the flash settings, and set the white point for your shots.I'd trade them all for RAW shooting, but that's just a personal preference that won't effect the casual shooter.The biggest problem is the photos. Sure, it's grainy in low-light, but that's not uncommon. Lighting is something even casual photographers should be aware of, and something professionals or enthusiasts can take years to master. So the grainy low-light photos aren't a dealbreaker for me.The color, however, is abysmal. The camera takes flat, bland photographs, and everything seems to blend together. It also has a really obnoxious tendency to automate everything for you, so two photographs taken at slightly different angles can look completely different, depending on what exposure setting and focal point the camera decided to use. Again, you can set these yourself, but they'll be reset automatically on a fairly regular basis.If you're looking for something for fun snapshots with friends and family, pick up a cheaper model without the frills. If you're looking for a camera that captures high contrast, vibrant images, drop a couple hundred more on a higher end model.Cameras are for capturing images.

I have always used slrs but I was looking for something I could take with me when traveling extra light.  Thinking I would only use a point and shoot once or twice a month I was shocked after figuring out it's versatility and quality of images.  Mind you I rarely strayed from 100iso so for all who kept it solely on full auto or on a high isosetting I cannot speak for you, but I was very rarely dissapointed with my photos.  Funny I should buy this inexpensive little point and shoot expecting to only need it maybe once or twice a month where in reality I could never part with it.  It is never going to compare to slr quality but I got more than my money's worth out of the S560 and I make no apologies in celebrating the fact.

The digital screen cracked and according to the Best Buy salesman it would cost about the same to repair it as to buy a new one--ie we are out $200 because mild pressure  on the screen inside a purse cracked it---a little hard to believe but nothing we can do about it.

It takes great pictures and is easy to use.

Nangle \"MrWeekend13\"", "ReviewID": "RIGTJAKJTGG5S", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "The Canon SD1200 is a sleek high powered pocket camera, that can go anywhere and still take great pictures day or night. It's not complicated to operate and yet if you so desire you can use the camera's manual mode. The lens is a Canon, therefore you can rely on it's quality. I've owned a series of other digitals, but I keep going back to the Canon. This is my third purchase in the SD Series and would definitely recommend this or any Canon Camera. The only downside is the 3x Zoom, that should be higher, and that is why I give it a 4.5 out of 5.", "Date": "August 13, 2009"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": null, "Features": null, "Name": null, "ImgURL": null, "ProductID": "B001DNY55E"}}
