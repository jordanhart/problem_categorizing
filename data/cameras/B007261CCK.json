Their product is very high quality and works excellent.  This is the camera for anyone who is looking for quality.  The pictures are great, clear and sharp.  The video part is very good as well.  I cannot say enough about this camera and the maker Samsung.  Dont hesitate to buy this product.", "Date": "September 7, 2012"}, {"Title": "My husband stole this camera.", "Author": "Amazon Customer \"Redeemed\"", "ReviewID": "R1Q5XJSLUEKK62", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I got this camera for myself. There was really no question. It was purple, you see, and Samsung seems to make good stuff, and 5 gold stars, and ON SALE! And it was PURPLE!! And then my husband picked it up, bought some tiny little card for inside it somewhere, and started using it all the time and uploading all these little films and pictures to Facebook. Apparently a bunch of cool editing stuff is built right into the camera, there is no disk that accompanies it. He spends hours doing this now. Oh well, I did steal his Kindle, so fair's fair I suppose.  His little movies are really cute, too. Maybe I need to get another one?", "Date": "November 1, 2012"}, {"Title": "Wrong memory card", "Author": "Kimberly D.", "ReviewID": "R20SVUUO9AARJJ", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "The camera is great, however, it suggests you also purchase the Transcend 16GB Class 10 SDHC Flash Memory Card (TS16GSDHC10E) with it BUT the memory card does NOT fit this camera.

In daylight picture quality is very good however at night it's best to stick to close distance snapshots as its low-light capability is not the best.

I bought it for my daughters 10th birthday, but it has become our whole families favorite.  It has built in silly screen options that she loves (make faces fatter, skinny, etc.) Easy point and shoot- and clear pics my husband loves.  Small and easy to pack that I love.

I love the HD factor but the buttons do not work efficiently and the smart auto is always doing things that I do not want it to and cannot control (will \"capture\" rather than just take photo ending with a total blur) . The smart auto on my other Samsung SL600 didn't do that. The SL600 is a much better camera. Only reason I bought another was because of something on the lens that I couldn't clean off and it interferred with photos where sky was a part of them. (The SL600 with HD would be super!)", "Date": "February 3, 2013"}, {"Title": "great", "Author": "patty", "ReviewID": "R37FWE285UFUNT", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Is a great little compact camera.

It won't turn on. This all started badly- I ordered this camera for a specific trip and the delivery didn't arrive on time. After leaving a bad review for that- they did contact me and compensated me with 25 dollars which was great. I took my camera to another trip to use it for the first time- and it doesn't work. Power button doesn't respond and I can't take pictures. Now they won't take it back because I don't have the carton box that says \"Samsung\" on it. I have everything else that came with the camera, but the box seems to be the most important thing that without they can't help me. Still trying to work this out, but these endless  emails arent giving me the impression that im going to get my money back. Stay away, not worth any price.
