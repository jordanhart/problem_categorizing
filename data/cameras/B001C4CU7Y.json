{"Reviews": [{"Title": "One of the better cameras in this price range", "Author": "M. Kaplan", "ReviewID": "R1M0J3HJ4S829", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "After reading some of the negative product reviews here, I felt compelled to defend this product.  To clarify: Yes, this point-and-shoot is susceptible to blocky images in higher ISO/low light.  But that's pretty much the standard for budget entries in the $100-200 price range.  For those who say Canon is superior: I took side-by-side comparison shots with my fiance's Powershot A590is, which, despite being older and two megapixels lower, is a similarly-featured camera at the same exact $150 price point.The difference?  If anything, the Kodak's picture quality was slightly superior at a forced 100 ISO in low light and it was a wash using auto-modes.  The Kodak's video quality, while not truly up to par to a promised \"720p HD quality,\" is far superior to what I've seen to other budget point-and-shoots, and with proper lighting is much better than your average, ultra-grainy Youtube-quality video from point-and-shoots.The interface on the Kodak is much, much easier to use, much to my relief!  I'm not a big fan of the Canon's menu navigation and buttons, whereas I'd compare the Kodak to the very easy to use budget Nikon Coolpix.Is it the best 8-10 megapixel on the market?  I can't claim enough expertise to pronounce anything definitive; I haven't tested every camera in this class.  But considering the price, considering some of the competition at this price point, and considering that you have to have modest expectations for a point-and-shoot that's less than $300 these days, you're getting a lot for your money in a very sleek form factor.  Video quality, Kodak service support, and being able to charge through USB are added bonuses.  I'm perfectly happy with this camera, so I'm pleased to recommend it.", "Date": "May 7, 2009"}, {"Title": "Kodak Brand earning some goodwill with the M1093IS", "Author": "A. Chu \"Chuey\"", "ReviewID": "R2TGARY8ET7LTO", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Kodak EasyShare M1093IS 10MP Digital Camera with 3x Optical Image Stabilized Zoom (Silver)Even though I was wary of making a purchase from Kodak (aren't they the polaroid guys and now by definition obsolete?  What do they know about digital cameras), I decided to take the dive and purchase a kodak camera after a ton of research.  I am certainly glad I did.  I believe if kodak keeps making cameras of this quality, they will soon be able to compete much more consistently with the dominant japanese brands.Granted I'm not a professional photographer but I do like to do a ton of online research before I purchase any electronics and a digital camera is no exception.  After probably several hours of research comparing reviews and sample shots, I decided on the M1093 because it had good reviews for photo quality.  Here are a few I referenced:[...][...][...]I also compared actual shots on digitalversus.com a useful tool for any shopper.  Here is a comparison of studio shots with one of the other cameras I was looking at, the panasonic fx500.[...]I'm no expert, but to my eye, the kodak pictures just looked cleaner and brighter.  The \"poor lighting\" shot was especially an eye opener.Basically, I had the budget to buy a camera twice as expensive, but why bother when this camera is cheaper and had all the features and quality i was looking for in a point in shoot i.e. great picture quality, good build quality, ease of use and finally 720p video mode.  Granted the video isn't great due to a lack of IS at the 720p resolution but for family shoots this will do the trick.At the end of the day.  I could have bought a panasonic fx500 or ts1(great video quality but prone to noisy pictures) or the fujifilm f200exr (great picture quality but no 720p video and very poor video quality), or finally a nikon coolpix s610 (no 720p from what i know) and on and on.Anyhow, I've purchased it and have been perfectly happy with it.  I don't agree with those who have complained about the build quality or \"flimsy controls\" and navigation interface.  I actually found the camera design and UI to be quite elegant after having used sony cameras (DSC-W80 and DSC-W55) for several years.  (I've found the included EasyShare gallery and one-touch upload software to be very easy to use and well-designed too as opposed to Sony's somewhat bloated Sony Picture Tool software)A great buy and great value in my book.", "Date": "July 19, 2009"}, {"Title": "Casual Photographer", "Author": "Claire", "ReviewID": "RDBFQQEDGW0C2", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I'm a very casual photographer, and am in NO way qualified to judge a camera's picture quality. The pictures I took with this camera were fine for what I need, and unless you're an avid photographer I think you'll be more than pleased. I had an older kodak 10mp before this, and the 1093 definitely takes better pictures in low light and shaky situations. It is a really well-built, well-designed camera with lots of convenient extra features (charges over USB, re-orients vertical pictures). The video feature is great as well (HD quality and length limited only by card space), and the file type integrates easily with iPhoto and iMovie. My main complaint is that it froze a couple of times in the short time I had it, but recovered quickly after powering off and on again. Also, the shutter button is a little too well-integrated and hard to find quickly.I lost it after three weeks and really miss it! I didn't order the same model to replace it, though--I went with the waterproof, shockproof Olympus 1050sw (Olympus Stylus 1050SW 10.1MP Digital Camera with 3x Optical Zoom (Black)) that I can use by the pool without fear. In terms of features it's about the same as the kodak but without optical image stabilization.

I was so excited, but much to my dismay, it took awful pictures. I was so disappointed!I bought my Kodak M1093 and the pictures were so clear and sharp.  I did take the same exact photo with the Kodak and with the Nikon.  What a difference!The only problem that I find, is the little toggle button.  Its so small and very hard to use, when you are trying to go to the menu and change modes.

I was sadly very wrong.  This item is enroute back to Kodak as I type, it just didn't live up to ANY expectations and I am dismayed that I'll lose out on my shipping fees in the back and forth return.  Basically the camera is slow, does NOT eliminate the blurry, dark shots that plague the average photographer, and I totally hate the tiny back features which include a micro sized joystick that makes me feel like I'm all thumbs.  The navigation is tricky, and even when you refer to the manual, you'll find yourself frustrated that it's not as trouble free as the ads try to make you believe.  The Smart Capture feature is supposed to eliminate the dead shots that you have to delete, but honestly, I spent more time deleting those very same dead shots on this camera than I did on my last, which, by the way, was also a Kodak.  In addition, the battery power failed in the middle of an event I was shooting, and the lens got stuck in the out position, unable to retract until I recharged the battery.  This made for a very hazardous breakage possibility when toting it back home.  I'm trying Nikon or Canon next time; reading the reviews they seems much more user friendly, doing what they're supposed to do, which is to make picture taking fun and simple for the non-professional as well as the seasoned pro.", "Date": "March 2, 2009"}, {"Title": "Kodak M1093 HD Video Sample", "Author": "D.

I think.- Hi resolution video.Dislikes:- Sometimes, if the battery dies while the lens is extended it gets stuck out until you can get power to it again. When that happens, I usually wait a minute for the battery to regain a little juice then quickly turn it on and off to get the lens retracted. This is a bad design flaw. My old Kodak EasyShare DX6490 4MP Digital Camera with 10X Optical Zoom was smart enough to not allow you to extend the lens without enough juice and always retracted it just before dieing.- The lens is starting to make focusing noises after 2 months. My DX6490 did the same thing after 1+ years. You could hear the noise in recored videos.- Takes too long to shoot from being off and takes too long to turn off.- Switching between modes is a little slow because you have to go into the mode menu (dedicated button).- I assumed you'd be able to select aperture & shutter priority with this camera but you cannot. You can use presets like macro and landscape to suggest what you want but it's not the level of control I was looking for.Disclaimer: I've only owned Kodak EasyShare cameras.

The main drawback was that it only record video up to VGA resolution. The optical zoom and autofocus also does not operate once the recording starts. Based on the spec, the Kodak M1093IS seem to fit the bill. It was quite inexpensive($100) and record HD video at 720p resolution. Its optical zoom and autofocus also worked while recording.  But I was quite disappointed with both still picture and video performance. Both the pictures or video are grainy-lots of chroma noise unless under perfect lighting conditions.  The weak flash does not help on this matter either. While the optical zoom is operable during video recording, the video become very blurry during zooming. The autofocus kicks in after stopping zooming. The auto white balance also too sensitive and shifting visibly with slight change in lighting during panning. When playing back the video on computer, the audio and video got di-synchronized and the gap became increasingly larger as the clip getting longer although play back on camera appeared to be fine. The worst thing was that it give me error messages a couple of times and has to reformat the SD card to continue. Luckily, I did not have much important photos or video in it on those occasions. I also encountered error messages when transferring the pictures and videos to computer (claiming corrupt files) via the supplied USB cable. However, transferring the same through my SD card reader on the computer worked without any problem! I am not sure the SD card or the camera was the culprit. I do not have much confidence in this camera with important events. Overall, both still and video performance is below the Canon SD1200IS. I guess you get what you paid for!

Then, you're probably right.A lot of problems are simple user error. If you're not a good photographer, you can use a $5000 camera and you'll take lousy pix. If you do what you're supposed to (hold the camera steady, press the shutter release smoothly) you're going to take good pix with whatever you are using.For the price I paid, this camera is phenomenal. (My other camera is a Nikon D80, which I love). Even if I paid full price, I would have gotten the same thing: A good, small, flexible camera that gives me great pictures.

I've tried searching through the menus for a way to find or turn on a battery life indicator, but it's not to be found, apparently.  What this means is that if you haven't used it in a while, you better charge it before you take it anywhere to take pictures, because you might not get much use out of it before it dies, and you can't know until it starts to run down.
