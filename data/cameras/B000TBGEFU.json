{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Excellent Night Vision - Questionable Quality", "Author": "Roy Coffell", "ReviewID": "R3UXF0WKN61QDF", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Unlike other \"Night Vision\" cameras I've purchased or evaluated this one actually gives night vision that is good enough for home security purposes. In fact the night vision clarity and range are both very impressive. The only performance negative is that the camera has a narrow field of vision which of course does contribute to the excellent night vision range.  My camera arrived with (2) circuit board mounting screws missing and one mounting tab severely deformed.  One of the screws was rattling around inside the camera.  I disassembled the camera, fixed the mounting ear & installed the one mounting screw.  The camera works fine (the missing 4th mounting screw really isn't necessary).  For home security it would be nice if the camera included a microphone like many of the cheaper home security camera do.  However all of the cheaper cameras I've tested are virtually worthless for night vision.  Typically the useful night vision range with the cheaper cameras is about 1/4 the range they claim. This camera really delivers the night vision it advertises.", "Date": "September 10, 2007"}, {"Title": "Night Vision Died in 20 minutes", "Author": "Clyde G.", "ReviewID": "R27K6ZN6G1FHQO", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I liked the camera housing.  Sturdy and cast aluminium. The wide angle lens is good. It's very clear in the daylight.  The very first night I had installed the camera the IR illuminator led's failed about 20 min. after the sun went down. I can not recommend this camera if you want reliable night vision. I'm going to try another brand.", "Date": "April 22, 2013"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": "$229.95", "Features": "1/3'' Color CCD image sensor.
