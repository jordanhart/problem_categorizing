There is almost little or no shutter lag the second your press the shutter button. Auto focus is fast too. It wasn't so much that this was a standard point-and-shoot when I was looking for an ultra-slim camera - but most of the ultra-slim cameras I've tried sacrifice image quality to cram as much technology in such a little body - while boosting the price up. The LZ7 is a fantastic performer. The 6x optical zoom with OPTICAL image stabilization (not digital, I'm not a fan of \"digital\" image stabilization) is a plus. It's actually BETTER than the IS on the Canon SD700IS and SD800IS that I previously tested out (I returned both of them because paying DSLR body prices for a point-and-shoot camera is outrageous). The major plus of this camera is the image quality. Fantastic, sharp and decently saturated. It's one of the few cameras where I feel comfortable printing photos straight outta the camera. I even impressed a few colleagues of showing some 8x10s that I printed straight out of my silver LZ7 and they were shocked that I didn't take the shot with a DSLR. That's what I call great image quality!CONS: This is quite a beefy camera. In the age of ultra-slim point-and-shoot cameras that boasts the same features as the LZ7, for the price I paid for it, it's totally worth it. The use of AA batteries might be convenient to some, but it sure contributes to the weight and size of this camera. I'm still pleased regardless. The image quality and pros outweigh the cons of this camera.", "Date": "April 1, 2007"}, {"Title": "Panasonic DMC-LZ7", "Author": "E. Smith", "ReviewID": "R2LZEIZH566RWZ", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Many reviews comment about the bulkiness of this camera.  That's what drew me to the LZ7,... it's size.  I have large hands and cannot curl my fingers around something small like many of the cameras currently on the market.  I also wanted something that was easy to use and had buttons large enough for my fingers to be able to use them without me stopping to look at the camera controls every time I wanted to take a picture. My main use of a digital camera is to take pictures of items that I put up at internet auction sites.  I didn't need something that would have such a high optical zoom that I could count the individual stitches on the picture of a sweater. But I did want something that gave me a little more clarity than my current Olympus 1.3 Megapixel without going into debt to get one.  I did a lot of research and came to the conclusion this camera should suit my needs nicely for several years to come.  I checked it out at a local big box retailer and was pleased with how it fit in my hand.  Buttons were easy to reach and use. The shutter button is located in from the edge just over 3/4 of an inch which allows my index finger to extend out comfortably as I press down. This is my first camera without a viewfinder and that is a little hard to get used to but it's the way of the future.  The screen is not quite 2 \u00bd\" diagonally but it is generous enough.  I like how the camera freezes the shot and shows it on the screen for a couple of seconds before it goes back to live mode. My Olympus required the card to be in the camera before I could take a picture. This one does not.  It has a bit of built in memory which can be a good and a bad thing.  It's great if you happen to forget to put the card back in and snap an important once in a lifetime shot but it's bad in the fact that once you take the shot you have to dig out the USB cable and connect the camera to your computer to get the picture.  I usually use a card reader but I'll be searching for a USB hub soon since the only free USB slots I have are in the back of my computer and I often forget to put the card back in. The thing about this camera that has impressed me more than anything else is the clarity and colors, especially in a shot that was totally lacking of light.  In testing, I went into an interior room that has no windows.  The only light was a small amount under the doors but not enough for me to see anything.  I set the camera on normal mode, pointed the camera toward the interior of the room and pressed the button.  When I looked at the picture I was amazed at how brightly lit and clear the shot was.  Colors like light lavender, turquoise, ekru and bright yellow were exact.  I doubt if I will have a lot of need to take pictures in total darkness but sometimes I get into a situation where the light is not always the greatest. I know this camera will be able to handle it and give me a great picture the first time. One review I read stated to be sure to read the manual.  That gave me the impression this camera was complicated.  I have not read the manual yet and have been able to take pictures with no problem.  I am sure I will be reading the manual when I want to take a picture with a feature I haven't used or to delve deeper into the many different options this camera has.  The pictures, all of mine have been JPG, are clear and the colors vivid.  The colors weren't so vivid for me in ISO mode but that's just one of 4-5 picture modes so you have plenty of options.  I haven't had the opportunity to use Scene mode yet but in playing around with it I found it very simple to select from the multitude of options and having the option name right there on the screen helps, and the animations on the option icons is an fun touch.  I really like the \"Heart\" (simple) mode.  It's great for taking my auction pictures but I have found that the other modes (Normal, ISO, Simple and Macro) are all pretty much `point and shoot' simple. I am sure they can be more complicated and I know, when I want to get into the more complicated side of this camera, it will be waiting for me.  Meanwhile, it and I are quite content using the simplistic controls of this Panasonic LZ7 to get some really great shots. If you are looking for a camera that is a little too big to stick in your shirt pocket or your cosmetic bag or your wallet but don't want something that requires a PhD to operate, consider the LZ7.

I narrowed it down to a Canon A710 and this. Since I didn't need the few extra features the Canon had, I went with the cheaper LZ7 and although I had some reservations, I'm very happy with my decision. I primarily use the camera for taking pictures of my pets, family get togethers and wildlife/nature pictures while hiking...I've had the camera for about two months.Pros: Simple to use, image stabilization works great, takes AA's so you'll never run out of batery power, there are several different image size settings that change to accomadate the use of the extended zoom (up to 9x v. regular 6x), manual exposure controls, nice bright screen, battery life is excellent using NiMH batteries, price for everything that comes with it.Cons: There is a lag when the flash is used, but I think this is common for all cameras that don't use a lithium battery; there is no view finder although I haven't encountered a situation where I've wanted one; the size is a little large for a \"pocket camera\" but any camera with a 6X optical zoom will be, and it's really not bad.I haven't really used the camera for night-time party type shots, which I'm guessing would not be a problem. I have also not used the video capabilities, which based on the claims should be excellent.Overall, for $200, you'd be hard pressed to find a 7 megapixel, 6x optical zoom camera with excellent image stablization, and excellent picture taking capabilities.  Seven years ago, I paid $180 for a 1.8 megapixel Fugi with no zoom...this camera is an awesome deal!", "Date": "April 15, 2007"}, {"Title": "First Impressions", "Author": "The Somnambulist \"CGC\"", "ReviewID": "R1UOZG0LPSNKTX", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I've only had the camera for a few days, so I hope to write a more encompassing review later.But I'm writing now to clarify that the movie function on the DMC-LZ7 DOES record sound...I had read (maybe in the product specs) that there was no sound, so I was quite happy to discover otherwise!  I had purchased the camera for its low-light abilities and thought I had to give up the sound to get it -- so glad that I was wrong.NOTE:  The nearly-identical DMC-LZ6 does NOT record sound. The lack of sound-recording and the size of the LCD monitor (the LZ7 has 2.5 inch screen, LZ6 has 2-inch screen) seem to be the only differences between the models.  Certainly worth the extra $30 or so to get the DMC-LZ7 with the sound.The DMC-LZ7K movie quality is good for a digicam.  My only comparison is my 4-5 year old Canon Elph -- and it's much better than that.  The old Elph only records approx 15 second clips, and the Lumix will keep going until you fill up your card.As one might expect, there is noticable chromatic noise using ISO settings above 800 -- but even the manual says that setting is basically only suitable for 4x6 prints.  But at least you will get the picture in extreme conditions, even if the quality is less than optimal.Again, comparing to my old camera - the 1200 ISO on the Lumix looks like the 400 ISO did in my old Elph.  The Lumix 400 ISO looks great, at least on the monitor.  I haven't printed anything yet.Shutter response time is good and I have no major complaints, at least not so far.I'm using rechargable AA batteries and a SanDisk Extreme III 1GB card.

I went to a local store and ran upon a Sony Cyber-Shot T-20...it was so cool looking and it had this super macro mode that really seemed to get in there tight.  Only problem is that it was very expensive and the shots were horribly noisy...my 2.3 mega pixel easy share Sony did better than this thing and their image stabalization was a joke...two days later back to the store it went!I then started searching and found a link about a Lumix camera.  That one is no longer made, but I ran into this model/review and was glad to see some consumer shots.  I read about the OIS stabilization and did some research at the Panasonic home page.  Very few people were disappointed in this camera and it wasn't too expensive.  Being the type of person to want it now, I found it at another local store and have since then been shooting test pic after test pic.  I took other shots with my Nikon and then this one and compared them.  I even did a home printer test.  So far it looks like this is a very good macro camera that gets rid of that shaky hand problem you can have and the prints will be at least as good as what I have been getting...still haven't ordered any real prints yet due to time constraints.Some people say it is too \"beefy\", but I find it just right.  It feels good in your hands, but it isn't as heavy as a pro-sumer and that really helps.Cons:  Zoom pictures don't look that good to me, but then again I'm not sure my Nikon does any better in this area.  The instruction book lacks a lot of the stuff that is explained in my Nikon book and I'd like to see more information about the camera and modes in the book in more of a detail fashion.  It has a hard time focusing on things at times, no matter what mode you put it in.  ISO over 400 is really noisy.  It doesn't have an ISO of 50.  Forget the high ISO...it even looks bad on the viewfinder.  It doesn't really do well without proper lighting.  I haven't taken any night shots yet, but pretty much if the flash is off you need a light source on your subject..but this may be true of any camera.  Sometimes pictures look a lot better on the viewfinder than they do on your computer.  This may be more to do with the whole DPI vs Pixel thing.  The camera \"captures in 72 DPI\" and sometimes in review in Windows it looks noisy, but hopefully this will not be in the print because it will be 300+ dpi and not as big.  But really the Sony pictures looked like water colors in all my test shots of that camera!  This one does way better.Pros:  Really nice macro pictures for the price of the camera and the OIS really seems to work well to help get you clear pictures...even with one hand...you don't know how many times I got home from a shoot and was disappointed by that camera shake problem from pushing the shutter and then having to stand still while it \"takes\" the picture...I don't like using a tripod.  This camera definately helps in that area.  Easy to transport and runs on all sorts of AA batteries.Bottom line is that this is a great camera for the price and it is a good semi-professional level \"back up\" camera/vacation camera for close up shots.  It seems to do what I need it to do and you can get really close to your subject, which is nice.  I just wish the non-macro shots using zoom turned out as good for me.  I'll have to do some more testing to see if maybe I just don't have anything good to take a picture of in normal mode...drought kind of killed all my nature shots and the shots inside the house have all been too dark or too full of flash at this point :/Just be sure not to get over a 2GB SD card if you do get one..this is something that is only on the inside of the package..if you want more than 2GB you have to get the other kind of card it takes or it won't work.  My 2GB card at the full high quality setting with little compression will take about 500 shots.  I was able to take several days worth of pictures, at least 2-300 shots with the supplied batteries.  This was with playing with the settings, turning it on, flash on sometimes, sometimes off, and walking around outside to get pictures with the camera on.  Also the first day I used the internal memory only...only about 5 high quality pictures there....and then I'd have to transfer with the cable.  So the batteries that I got with it really did last a good while.If I run into more items to share, I will update the review...otherwise happy picture taking!Update:  I have finally gotten some test prints and the camera detail is amazing.  I've gotten better with the zoom feature, but again I still lack a lot of things to do with the zoom.  The macro shots are great and very detailed.  I printed the picture of the flower I submitted and you could see every hair and pore on the hand.  That was just at the Kodak picture machine too.  I'm sure when I go through my professional lab the prints will be even better.  I purchased rayovack hybrid NiMh batteries for this because I could not find the recommended panasonic.  I've been packing it around and using it for about three weeks on the first set of charged batteries...these kinds come charged ready to use and then you can charge them again...so if you need a camera for some weekly shots to pack around with you, this is a real winner.  I'm very impressed with the camera for the money.  Using the view finder is still kind of hard...I often still put the camera up to my eye before I figure out what is going on...but I still say this is a really good pocket camera and well worth the money.  I also seem to sometimes get too close to a subject because I'm used to using the eye viewfinder/flip finder on my Nikon, but the camera stabalization has almost eliminated the out of focus problem from pressing the shutter button.  I only had about 5 or 6 out of 100 close up shots of some flowers that were too blurry and part of that was because I got the subject too close to the lens!  I'm so glad I found this camera.

I also like the 16 x 9 native pixel layout. The video does indeed look very good. It's also inexpensive. The drawbacks to the camera are:1) It isn't very compact. It does fit in my pocket, as I bought it for a pocket camera, however it's pretty bulky and heavy. From pictures online it's hard to tell.2) Low light performance is poor. My other pocket cameras that shoot 30fps video with sound, namely the Nikon 5200, and the Canon A620 and SD series both do much better with low light shots in stills and video. The pixelation is noticeable even beyond normal JPG artifacts.3) The wide angle is not very wide. I didn't realize how much I used the widest angle of the other cameras until I started using the Lumix. It has a pretty good zoom, but not wide. I take photos of people at tables occasionally using the ever popular \"wine glass\" tripod, and I simply can't get more than one person's face in any one shot with the Lumix lens.In my view it's a specialty camera.

My Fuji is very fast and responsive. But I was amazed how LUMIX can do. I set the resolution to its max 7.2 MP, HQ, change image preview off so as to test this feature. I put a 1 GB 60x SD card in it. The lag time between each shot is under a second! The image quality is very good, almost comparable to those pros.Pros:Fast start, Fast focus, supper fast write images.Very easy to use if you use Simple mode and still get very decent pictures.Stabilizer is amazing as I have compared with Canon optical stabilizer, Olympus digital stabilizer, Samsung anti shaking mechanism. This is the best.EZ (Easy Zoom) works great, it is actually 9x optical zoom if you shoot 5MP and below.Easy menu to set up. Func key is a good companion.The on-off switch is really good thing, you know the status of your camera right away. It is off or it is in sleep.Video works well. It has sound. I took a 2 minute on the highway recording cars passed by and the noice.

Any low-speed under 1 second is almost impossible to set by yourself. You have take whatever the screen mode gives you.The I-mode is really unnecessary feature, which stays for intelligent, but if you use it, it usually set to higher ISO sensitivity and faster speed.

Here are a few highlights.1) Noise - the big problem reported by many Panasonic users is noise.  I've found that keeping the camera set to 100 ISO is fine for reducing noise in general outdoor conditions.  Indoors, there is some noise when using the flash or not, but it is not a show-stopper -- especially if you're planning on printing mostly 4x6 prints.2) Size/Build - the camera is a bit bulky.  It's nice for those of us with bigger hands.  It won't fit in your pocket, but it's small enough to easily fit in a bag.  It also feels a lot sturdier than most other compact digital cameras.3) Zoom/OIS - The 6x zoom works really well in conjunction with image stabilization.  I get sharper 6x 7.2 MP pictures than when I was taking 3x 3 MP pictures with a Canon PowerShot.Another benefit of the zoom is that the camera has a larger-than-average lens (to let in enough light for zoom shots, I imagine).  This is nice because it lets more light in for all pictures, which means you don't need the flash as much.  I've even been able to take 6x zoom pictures in dusk lighting at 100ISO that come out reasonably noise-free!4) Battery life - Battery life is good.  Use NiMH; there's no good reason to use non-rechargeable batteries.5) The video is very good.  This camera (LZ7) records sound, but it's little brother (LZ6) does not, saving you $20 or $30, but making it essentially useless as a video camera (unless you love overdubbing).6) Saturation - a few other reviews have alluded to this.  The colours produced by this camera are very vivid and striking.Overall, this is a very nice 7 MP 6x zoom camera.

I swapped them out when the zoom started slowing.  I could have taken more pictures with them, but wanted the faster 'ready' response time.The download speed to the above SD card is great, and provides nice response time after a non-flash photo.  The flash recharge seems to take a bit longer to bring the camera back to a 'ready' state, especially when the batteries are low.With respect to image quality, the camera is great for objects.  However, pictures of people are better with more light (sunlight or flash).Changing the ISO to 800 or 1250 makes the pictures look very grainy.  Better lighting probably would have made the pictures turn out better, but then I probably wouldn't have needed to use this setting!I like the camera's macro mode, though again, sufficient lighting is the key to higher quality images.I've also tried the movie mode, which is fabulous.  The only drawback is you cannot use the zoom while recording a movie.  There is also no stereo sound (of course, what can you expect from a small unit like this?).The protective covering over the LCD should be a default feature for all cameras.  I really appreciated this feature, though I wonder if it could be replaced if it ended up with an excessive amount of scratches.  Haven't pursued an answer to this question yet.The camera's functions were very accessible.  I especially like the fact that when pushing the shutter button the settings menu goes away and allows you to continue taking pictures, i.e., you don't have to 'exit\" the settings menus before attempting to take another shot--just push the shutter button.I also dropped this camera a couple times, once on brick (outside) and once on a wood floor.  It still functions as if new (though I'm not sure how much of an impact it could take before becoming non-functional).  Hence, it seems rather durable for the average user.I'm a happy customer, and am very pleased with this purchase.  I liked the price for the features provided in the camera.", "Date": "June 13, 2007"}, {"Title": "Great camera at a great price", "Author": "Tom Skywalker", "ReviewID": "R3IHQ0T9ELMFMO", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I have possessed the DMC LZ7 digital camera for about 3 months and this is my first camera ever. I am an amateur photographer and photography has become one of my latest hobby. Based on my modest experience, here is what I think about it:PROS:+ Good image quality. You can adjust the settings of your camera to adapt to external conditions, like lighting, sunshine etc. Some good pictures I have taken by specifically adjusting such settings include an  aerial picture (from an airplane traveling at 500+ mph) and sunrise, and in all case, I was very happy about the image quality. The scenery mode allows you to get the best pictures ranging from protraits to pictures of starry sky, going through pictures of candles, snow etc. The camera also compensates for factors jitter (unwanted motion of the camera), background light etc. in order to output the best picture.+ The menus of the camera are pretty easy to navigate with.+ Compared to many other cameras I've looked into before deciding on this one, the DMC-LZ7 has a 6x optical zoom, which you'll find cooler than a 3x optical zoom, although I realize that a 3x optical zoom might be sufficient for most of us. I consider a maximum optical zoom of 6x to be a bonus of the DMZ-LZ7.+ For MOST situations (see the 2nd con below) that amateur (and pros alike) will encounter, you can just point and shoot with the DMZ-LZ7 and get good results. That is, in these common situations like your friend's birthday, you don't necessarily have to adjust for background light, white balance etc. Beginners will find this camera easy to use, once they learn its basics.+ The manual that comes with the camera is clearly laid out and very detailed.+ I've not tried the motion picture feature a lot. All I can say is that I find it ok, and recorded video comes with sound. Camera comes with a cable which you can connect directly to your TV and which enables you to view your pictures and videos on your TV screen. If you are looking for better motion pictures, you might want to buy a video camera specifically - this one is mainly for still photos.+ It's not that heavy. To give you a rough idea, its maximum weight does not exceed that of 3 mobile phones.+ It fits in my pockets.+ You can buy optional accessories like carrying case, camera stand, ac adapter etc.+ Comes with software which, by the look of the software manual, looks pretty easy to use. I have not tried the software in depth. What you need to know is that the software helps you process the image, resize it, prints the date on it etc. I am guessing that nearly all digital cams on the market come with similar software.CONS:- The optional camera case does NOT fit in my pockets. My pockets have the same size as those in 31 X 32 jeans. Oh well, who cares about this? The carrying case has its own belt clip. Some people might find the camera bulky for that reason, but I really don't. (I bought the hard case for the DMZ-LZ7 on amazon.com and I recommend it too.)- There's a lot to learn!!! If you really want to get the best quality pics for various situations like fast action sports events, pictures of fireworks, etc, you really need to spend time learning how to use this camera. And this means going through its manual well. I would advise people to read the manual and try the various stuffs in it, and then go through the manual again after they gain some experience with the camera (after a few months or one year maybe).I am mentioning this because it is not fair to blame the DMC LZ7 for poor quality pics if you've not mastered it. I believe the same applies to any digital camera on the market. However, as mentioned above, the scenery mode contains different pre-set parameters which you can use to obtain a great picture of your dog catching a frisby in mid-air, and other things which upto now, you'd have thought only professionals could do (although I think a professional can do a slightly better job than amateurs!).Bottom Line:I recommend it. For its price, the DMC LZ7 is a more than a good deal. Even if there may be better and more costly cams on the market, I am sure that the DMC LZ7 is not very far behind these cams in matters of technology. A perfect digital camera would cost you $ 1000+.

Learning to use all the many features is comparable to learning to use a computer for the first time.  I basically use just the \"point-and-shoot\" but I read the manual from cover to cover and plan to try the advanced features.  I downloaded my first set of pictures to my Mac OSX and was pleased with how easy and fast it went.  The pictures are crisp and the color is great.  Other reviewers seem to want a smaller camera, but this one fits my hand very comfortably and the dial on top is positioned so that you can use it with your thumb.  I appreciate the AA batteries.  My snapshot camera ran through very expensive batteries at a fast clip and I always ran out of juice at most inconvenient times.  I bought rechargable AA batteries for the Lumix, but I'm still working on the alkaline ones that came with the camera.  I miss the viewfinder (keep holding the camera up to my face!) but I'll learn to use the screen.  In bright sunlight the image is very dark (like almost nonexistent).  I just point and shoot a few pictures then when I'm in the shade I look at the images and delete the ones I don't like.  It's worked very well so far.  The dark screen doesn't mean the picture will be dark.  I bought an inexpensive 2 GB Kingston memory card from Amazon.  It came with a plastic case to store it in when it's full.

As compared to other point and shoots in its price range, this has significantly better capabilities. I am particularly impressed with its ability to take blur-free pictures while on the move in a vehicle.Color modes are sufficient, and the 6X zoom+OIS is really handy for getting some nice long range shots. The camera boots up real quick too, and the burst mode is pretty effective.Another plus point is the really nice video mode, which allows you to take VGA quality movies with sound. The videos come out really nice and it is quite handy to make good resolution small home videos.Battery life is pretty good, and a set of 2 AA NiMH batteries last for at least 300 shots in typical usage conditions.Only small con is the size. The camera is slightly thicker than other point and shoots owing to the large zoom lenses. So, it cant be carried in a trouser/jeans pocket.Received prompt shipping by by amazon.

I wanted a camera for under $100 for a vacation that I'm about to take.  I thought I would take a chance on this one since it was $103 with shipping.

The pictures look less than stellar on the lcd but when transferred to computer look amazing!  Even in the low light situations there was very little noise, just depends on the setting you pick.  I don't think reading the manual would help to much as actually getting out there and trying different conditions.  The camera for the most part does what I want it to but it's at the mercy of the operator.  It has many different preset options for you choose from including sunset and beach modes; I mention these since they seem uncommon.I think anyone could be successful at taking pictures with this camera in most conditions.  Just remember that if it doesn't come out the way you want then you may have to change the settings.

The VGA Movie feature provides amazingly sharp pictures for a still camera - though, the zoom does not work in Movie mode.CONS:If pictures are taken outside when the sun is not out, the pictures can be somewhat on the darker side compared to my previous Fuji camera.  However, selection of one of the \"scene\" modes usually clears this up.  If you wish to use the VGA Movie mode, be sure to use a SDHC card rated with at least 10mb/sec transfer rate.  I have a SanDisk Ultra II card that works great for capturing movies.  However, my regular SanDisk SD card freezes up when in VGA mode.  There's a slip of paper in the box in which Panasonic advises you of this requirement - but this is not disclosed within any of the \"specification\" areas on any of the websites selling this camera.  The batteries that come with the camera, the self-promoted Panasonic Oxyride ones, well....they really stink.

Powell \"JP\"", "ReviewID": "R33QWJ75CLQ6IP", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "People often seem to buy things that have obvious characteristics they don't like, and then complain when they get exactly what they bought.  For example, if you want a super-slim camera, it makes no sense to complain that the Lumix is bulky because it is clearly not a super-slim camera.  It is, rather, a camera on the small end of the popular Canon A series.  That said, here are what I found to be the camera's good and bad points.  First, the good:GOOD:1) It takes AA batteries.  True, these don't have the same oomph as proprietary Li-Ion batteries, but they're cheap -- even rechargeable NiMH AA -- and available everywhere.  Personally, I think this flexibility is more than worth the size trade-off and was one of the reasons I looked for a camera in this range.2) Shutter lag is minimal.  Again, this is relative.  Is the Lumix as quick as a decent DSLR?  Of course not.  But is it quicker than most comparable point-and-shoots?  Yes.  And for a point-and-shoot, this is a significant plus.3) The 6x optical zoom works well and is on the high end for a camera in this price bracket.4) The anti-shake works reasonably well...and is particularly useful when combined with the upper end of the 6x optical zoom.5) Picture quality...particularly of outdoor shots....is good and relatively noise free.6) Overall ergonomics are good.Now, the BAD:1) There is an annoying lag between what the camera is pointed at and what appears on the LCD viewer.  I also have a Canon A630, for example, and it tracks MUCH quicker.  This lag exists whether the anti-shake is activated or not, and is my biggest complaint with this camera.2) Like many point-and-shoots, the Lumix takes much better shots outdoors than inside, even though inside shots are where it is best suited (family pics, things like that).  Again, compared to my Canon A630 (admittedly, a more expensive camera), the Lumix sharpness and color balance is inferior.3) As much as I like the 6x optical zoom, for a point-and-shoot I'd much rather have a better wide angle.  I'm simply more often going to use the camera to take group people shots than ones of birds a mile away.4) A minor complaint is that this camera lacks manual aperture and shutter control.  I've found that when you really use these features, they're quite valuable.  But, again, this is a minor complaint because most cameras at this price point don't have this feature, either.RECOMMENDATION:  Overall, this is a great camera for what it is.  However, I'd steer you to the Canon PowerShot A570IS 7.1MP, which I think overall is a better and more versatile camera...and slightly cheaper.  The Canon has only a 4x zoom, but offers more manual controls and gives better overall performance.", "Date": "January 17, 2008"}, {"Title": "Great little camera at a great price", "Author": "G.

Then I read the Owner's Manual and learned about ISO settings, flash settings, aspect ratios, etc., I figured out that I was camera challenged.  By about the 10th picture, I figured out what I was doing wrong and discovered this is really a great little camera.The pros of this camera is that it has settings for nearly everything that you can think of and that you can become camera knowledgeable.The cons are that I really did not find this camera to be point and shoot and the menu is slightly more complex that my Kodak digital.  I found that when I tried the point and shoot, the picture quality was not as good.  Using the scene settings and adjusting them gave me an incredible picture.  I work at the top of a hill and have a beautiful panoramic view down below.  I took a picture at the highest zoom and the picture is absolutely gorgeous!  I am literally talking a view for miles.  I could not believe the amount of detail this camera picked up.Fortunately, I am good with electronics and figured out the menu fairly quickly.  However, this could be a rather complicated menu for those that lack experience with digital cameras.I gave the item an overall rating of a 4 because I feel that Panasonic could have made the point and shoot feature better.

After reading some of the reviews, I was a little hesitant to make this purchase.  After considering the price and the features, I went ahead and bought this camera.I took my daughter to the zoo yesterday to try out her new Panasonic Lumix DMC-LZ7K.  She used her camera, and I used my Nikon D-50 DSLR, which I am very happy with.  During use, I realized the Panasonic Lumix DMC-LZ7K has a very quick shutter response and focus in comparison to the many point and shoot cameras I have used.While processing the photos, I had to heavily utilize the Nikon Editor program to fix the contrast and color on almost every photo from my Nikon D-50.  While processing the photos from the Panasonic Lumix DMC-LZ7K, I had to make no modifications to the contrast, color, or sharpness.  The photos were perfect!Of course, once processed, the quality of the Nikon D-50 photos are better quality.  But now I know I can use this Panasonic camera if there is ever a time that I can not lug alot of equipment with me.If you are looking for an affordable point and shoot camera, I recommend the Panasonic Lumix DMC-LZ7K.", "Date": "May 12, 2008"}, {"Title": "Nice compact camera but some drawbacks", "Author": "Jeffrey Bullard \"JBull\"", "ReviewID": "RXMI6UOFRBP8Y", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I bought this camera as a second camera to my Canon Digital Rebel.  I needed a ultra portable camera for my backpacking vacations.The Good:This camera takes good pictures and fits into my shirt pocket.  It has 6X optical zoom and optical image stabilization which works well at 6X zoom.  The white balance selections are important as I found outdoor pictures had a blue-green cast.  Using the outdoor white balance improved this to my satisfaction. The auto focus is good and you can customize the setting so that the camera auto focuses on the correct portion of the image frame. The LCD is bright and lager enough.  The price I paid ($119) was a good deal for these features.The Bad:There is noticeable vignetting when shooting at 1X zoom.  Vignetting is when the corners of the pictures are darker than the center.  Most of my outdoors pictures need to be cropped to remove the darker edges.  This is a common problem in point-and-shoot cameras and this one is no different.  Also on bright images there is noticeable chromatic aberration but that is to be expected on any zoom lens less than $300. I would also like to have more custom settings so I can control shutter speed, ISO, and f/ratio.  There are a couple of different settings but you don't have complete control like you would on a DSLR.  The picture quality and ability to control depth of field, focal ratio etc are not nearly on par with my Canon DSLR.  Also its a bit larger and heavier than some of the new ultra-slim point-and-shoot cameras.Overall its a good camera and a great value for the price.  It is unreasonable to expect it to have the full manual control features that a DSLR has.  And most people don't want those features or understand how to use them anyway.  It is a \"point-and-shoot\" after all. I think its a good purchase for someone who wants a very portable camera that takes good pictures without having to understand ISO, f stops, and exposure time.  Not a good purchase for someone who is really interested in photography and image composition.

The OIS worked very well, the 6x zoom was a refreshing feature in a \"compact\" camera but what I thought was a convenience in AA batteries actually turned out to be a curse. This camera devours AA's. I was lucky to get 50 - 60 shots (most without using the flash) before the 2500 mAh NiMH batteries were completely drained. The viewfinder was sharp and clear unless viewed in direct sunlight. Like others have stated the camera is bulkier and heavier compared to most other  ultra compacts.The Venus Engine III and the Lumix Vario Element lens proved to be this camera's biggest downfalls. All the shots I took were quite noisy and lacked detail. I found the best \"quality\" shots were taken with ISO set to either 100 or 200. Anything more and the image suffers. The \"Night Scenery\" mode allowed for some really nice night / low light pictures but you'll  need a tripod. Continuous shooting speeds (without the flash) were a pleasant surprise and I've found the menu systems on Panasonic cameras are very easy to navigate. Have to agree with the others on the video function and the lack of a microphone / speaker (?)It's a decent camera as long as you aren't planning on making prints larger than 5x7's.

I was very leary of buying a panasonic product (personal past history was NOT good), but I was in a bind so I bought it...best gamble I've ever taken.I read the manual that night while waiting for a concert to begin...I especially love the greats pics I took at that concert.

It is very simple to use (my mother now has the same one and she loves it too) and it takes AA batteries which is a HUGE plus.

Here is what I think about the camera:Pros:- Fast auto focus- The camera, with easy-to-read user manual, is easy to use- High/nice picture quality. I own a Nikkon and Canon cameras and honestly, I think the picture quality of Panasonic is comparable to those two brands.- You probably won't get another camera that has as many features as this one at a price this low! The 6X zoom is wonderful! Digital zoom can go as great as 24X.- Good video quality- Can take black-and-white and sepia pictures- The camera is not bulky at all. In fact, it's not-too-slim feature makes it easy to handle and more suitable for frequent user. This camera is definitely made for use, not for watch.Cons:- The flash is too bright. For better picture quality, I would suggest to take your pictures in daylight. I tried to take pictures in both a well lit and a dark room at night. T he object looked way too pale in the picture because of the bright flash.- Batteries didn't last as long as I expected. The Panasonic Oxyride batteries that came with the camera died after one hour of inconsecutive uses. I then used alkaline batteries. They lasted a bit longer, typically two hours of inconsecutive uses with about 100 to 130 shots. Rechargable batteries might work longer but I haven't tried yet.- The camera doesn't play back videos. To me, this is not a problem.Overall, I am quite satisfied with the camera except for the flash.

I've found that it works best in light situations that are bright (but not too bright) to medium. The image quality is excellent at ISOs 200 or below, and I really love the custom white balance feature and the 6x zoom.In bright sunshine (I took this camera to Las Vegas) the colors look slightly dull, and highlights tend to get washed out if you are photographing highly contrasting objects. However, that can be (somewhat) fixed through Photoshop.In low light settings, or using ISO 400 and above, the images start to show a lot of noise, and pictures above ISO 800 are pretty much unusable. This is a source of frustration to me as I often photograph live bands in dark clubs (where flash is discouraged). However, I must mention that I'm nitpicking here and most compact cameras in this price range perform at the same disgusting noise level, except for the discontinued Fuji Finepix F10, F20, F30s.There is a significant lag between shots, and it usually takes 3 seconds before the next shot is possible when using flash. Not a big problem for me, as I prefer to avoid flash.I like the fact that this camera takes standard AA size batteries, so I don't have to wait for a recharge when batteries are dead. I highly recommend using NiMH batteries; they last for a long, long time on one charge, around 450-500 shots I think. In comparison, Alkaline batteries are eaten alive after 150 pictures, if that.I've had the camera for 9 months, and so far no problems whatsoever. I even dropped it 3 ft onto a rock, after which it slipped underneath into wet mud, and it came out alive with two scratch wounds.Overall, I'm happy with the camera. It's hard to beat at this price.

"malfunction after two weeks", "Author": "Marklin, CA", "ReviewID": "R35CHYEB6RP3DD", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I bought this camera from B&H.; I used the camera for two weeks (only take around 100 pictures). Then The image shown on the LCD starts to be distorted. B&H; said that I have to send it back to panasonic service center for reparing. Then I did and paid all the shipping and handle fee. :-(One thing should be awared that the service center may use a refurbished item to replace the one of malfuction. Considering I only used it for two weeks, it sounds I buy a refurbished product with a higher price. :-(", "Date": "August 30, 2007"}, {"Title": "A horrible product", "Author": "S. Sheikh", "ReviewID": "RILV53FEBAF4C", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "Its a horrible product.  When you zoom in it gets fuzzy and stays fuzzy. Pictures come out dark and its not a great product.

My only gripe is that it takes f o r e v e r to upload photos onto my four year-old laptop, insanely slow (presumably due to not having high-speed USB). Do not like the upload software at all, hard to follow.", "Date": "June 8, 2007"}, {"Title": "Tradeoffs", "Author": "George Tom Coumaris", "ReviewID": "R2OXSKLCVK6LG", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "I decided to stick with the FX3 model- I like the much smaller size (pocket size), the real Leica lens, and the rechargeable battery. I don't use much zoom enough where the 6x vs. 3x matters to me and unless you're doing billboard posters 6meg vs. 7.2 meg is ridiculous. Most downsize resolution anyway to take less space and work easier in photo programs.All other features the same.", "Date": "August 29, 2007"}, {"Title": "The camera is good for still photos and an occasional video", "Author": "C. Luckinbill \"radioengineer\"", "ReviewID": "R2554GGP1XR4SH", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "I settled for a DMC-TZ1 which offers:1) brighter picture in low light2) lens with a wider viewing area3) both optical and digital zoom during video recording4) audio may be heard on video playbackI wish the TZ1 used AA batteries and had a mode for continuous still frame shooting. The latter could be fixed if Panasonic would upgrade camera software features; probably to much of a tech burdon for the camera market.", "Date": "July 10, 2007"}, {"Title": "It's a great digital camera", "Author": "I.

There are large selection of cameras which are within the reach of different income groups. That is the greatness of Amazon. The rating of sellers gives the customer confidence to purchase the item from them. I already purchased several items, like the Panasonic digital camera, recharbeable batteries, Thoshiba laptop and a laptop bag from Amazon. Any things I need I will go to Amazon only.", "Date": "May 14, 2007"}, {"Title": "Great Specs but not to the mark", "Author": "Milap Shah", "ReviewID": "R1KZRDV86MYJFA", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "I got this camera for my family, I read the specs and was impressed, but when i took the initial snaps they were of no great quality. The resolution was preety bad as compared to 7 mp camera and lcd screen is of no great quality.

But the picture turned into a horror movie instead of \"Love Story\" once i have it in my hands.. Its lcd is horrible, memory is very small that in the first 10 mins of my NY trip, it got full, and the machine is not able to take \"visible\" pictures at all.
