{"Reviews": [{"Title": "I love this camera!!!", "Author": "Gerald O'Neil \"jerrysgal4ever\"", "ReviewID": "RRCBIN0ZRFH4K", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I bought this camera because my previous digital camera was hugs, bulky, and just difficult to use, and I was getting ready to go overseas for a few weeks as part of an international adoption. I wanted something that was compact and took good pics. This pretty red camera has a huge (3\") display that fills almost the whole back side of the camera. The one thing I noticed right away is that when you snap a picture, it immediately takes the pic. My old digital camera had a noticeable delay in between pushing the shutter button and when the picture was actually taken, leaving plenty of time to move and blur the picture and plenty of time to miss those precious spontaneous pics. It also takes short videos which came in very handy on my visit trip! The camera is very easy to use, and a whole 10 megapixels which is amazing for the very reasonable price of the camera. I love it!!!", "Date": "January 2, 2009"}, {"Title": "You get what you pay for", "Author": "Cynthia Correa \"Cindy\"", "ReviewID": "R2VC46O8XLEGXM", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "I really like the look of this camera and it's super easy to use. The joystick pad it nice and easy to use. Overall, I like this camera, but I wouldn't by it again or recommend it to someone else for these reasons:First, I can't stand rechargeable batteries, they never stay charged and when I really need new batteries, I can't just go buy some. But that's very personal, some people have had great experiences with rechargeable.Second, if the batteries are low, the whole thing shuts down. It can't run the battery to the end of it's life, if it gets low, it won't function. So like you'll take a really great shot and the it will shut down and so you'll turn it back on to see the shot and it's not there. Soooo frustrating!! If it had an option to turn off the LCD screen and just use a viewfinder that would probably help, but wait! there's no viewfinder.Third, the printing on the buttons rub off. I really don't even remember which button is play back and which one is menu, I just have to keep pressing buttons until I hit the right one. What ever ink or whatever it is they use is really poor quality.And lastly, don't drop it, take it to the beach, get ANY water near it, or let your kids touch it too much because any little thing will make it not work for a few days, but luckily, it always comes back, when you don't need it.", "Date": "April 21, 2010"}, {"Title": "Disappointed", "Author": "NM Farmer", "ReviewID": "R1ML1LFF27P7XJ", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "The Kodak M1033 is easy to use and has quick flash refresh time but the pictures were grainy and much worse than my 4 mp camera.

I am so impressed, all of my other cameras are Cannons for a price of around $280 each.

So I did my research (I thought) and took the plunge.  This camera is really everything I was looking for (and much more), except for one thing.  The \"joy stick\" button that you use to go through the menus, review the pictures, and probably a lot more that I don't know about, is less than half the size of my little fingernail, and I don't have big hands.  I had to use my fingernail to move it and, most of the time, it didn't move in the direction I wanted it to (didn't get to the function I wanted) because my fingernail was just a little too much toward another direction.  I hope that makes sense.  I REALLY wouldn't recommend this camera for anyone who has large, or even medium-size, fingers.In addition, while I was setting up my preferences, I noticed that the battery needed to be charged again.  I had fully charged it when I got it.  I don't know how long I was playing with it before I noticed this, and I don't know if this is usual, but I thought I'd mention it.One of the preferences I set up was for the camera to turn itself off after not being used for 3 minutes.  After I was finished playing with it, I pressed the button to manually turn it off, and it wouldn't turn off.  I didn't think about taking the battery out (novice, remember?), so I just left it alone.  It turned itself off after about 4 hours!  From then on, it turned on and off just as it was supposed to.Anyway, except for those things, the camera was great!  The 3\" display is terrific.  There's virtually no delay between pressing the button and the picture being taken.  The pictures are good, but I'm really no judge.  Upon reading the instruction manual, I found that the camera had many, many more features than I ever anticipated needing, but it's nice to know that they're there.I guess it's back to doing more research.", "Date": "July 10, 2009"}, {"Title": "major flaw", "Author": "Xanmom", "ReviewID": "R3U6Z8RB3QRQN1", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "bought in 9/08, since 1/09 when i turn camera on, the start up noise is on, screen is very blurry then it turns off by itself right away. i thought battery had to be replaced, did that, charged it up, still the same. googled the condition, found lots of people have same problem.  gotta make time in the next few days to be on the phone to india to get a replacement phone from them.  good luck huh?i'm really mad.  should have gotten the exorbitant insurance policy from best buy. will  never ever buy kodak again.", "Date": "March 13, 2009"}, {"Title": "DOESNT SHOW BATTERY USAGE--OTHERWISE OK!", "Author": "Gerald J.
