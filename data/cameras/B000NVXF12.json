{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Surely the best digital SLR system", "Author": "Dai Dant", "ReviewID": "R1AC6BAQ84VEDW", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I am very impressed with this digital SLR. For years I used Olympus OM series film cameras with satsfaction. As digital camera image quality improved, I decided to go digital and have tried Nikon, Canon and Fuji SLRs. All were bulky and heavy, showing their heritage as modified designs for 35mm film adapted for use with smaller digital sensors.Having design their E-series as digital from the outset, Olympus seem to me to have far superior handling qualities. Carrying an E-410 all day is far preferrable to any of the rival makers models I bought. I first used an E-400, and agreed with the reviews which found images taken at high ISO \"filmspeed\" settings somewhat noisy. This problem is resolved in the E-410 which uses a different sensor. Another improvement is in the autofucussing which is again, much improved.As well as the conventional SLR viewfinder, the E-410 gives one the option of composing shots in the LCD screen on the camera back as a \"live preview\". It would be great if this worked as quickly as on a pocket digital camera, but there is in fact quite a delay between pressing the shutter release and the image being focussed and captured. Notwishtanding this, I have found the live preview invaluable for macro work and I would hate to be without it now.Another good feature of the recent E-series models is the \"supersonic wave filter for dust reduction\". Unlike film SLR cameras, digital ones can be ruined by dust on the sensor introduced when lenses are changed. Nikon offers sofware which maps and then cancels out the specks - sounds like a rubbish \"solution\"! Olympus and Canon offer sonic systems which shake the sensor at start up to keep dust away. I'm ultra cautious when changing lenses, but I'm greatly reassured by reviews which suggest that the Olympus system really can be effective.Finally Olympus seem to be developing a truly comprehensive system with a great (if expensive) selection of lenses and flash units. For clinical medical and dental photography they have an excellent 50mm (equivalent to 100mm in a 35mm format camera) macro lens which can also capture potraits or full body views. This can be coupled to a ring flash or twin macro flash with TTL metering and capable of taking perfectly exposed images straight out of the box. The only weak part of the system is the flash ring FR-1 needed to couple the flash head to the lens. I have bought three of these, and all three have broken in normal use!The problem with the FR-1 is that the front element of it is held on to the main body by three TINY screws which just aren't up to the job. As I needed to keep working in three different centres I didn't return the units (what would be the point in exchanging one badly designed bit of kit for an identical one anyway). My solution is to permanently glue the front to the main body with Araldite. I hope that this shockingly poor piece of design isn't indicative of other problems elsewhere in the range.", "Date": "August 11, 2007"}, {"Title": "best value around for a 10MP DSLR", "Author": "M.

I did a lot of research comparing it with other comparable 10MP DSLR's like the Nikon D40X and the Canon Digital Rebel XTi, and although these others have their own subtle advantages over the E410, the price, functionality, quality, and portability (due to its light weight) can't be beat.  It has taken me a little bit to get used to the functions of this camera (this is my first digital SLR) but it hasn't taken me long to appreciate all its capabilities.  I do look forward to getting a longer focal length zoom lens and a flash, at some point.  But definitely it's lots of fun and easy to play around with for indoor and outdoor photos.", "Date": "December 29, 2007"}, {"Title": "Elegant small DSLR", "Author": "David Boldt", "ReviewID": "R170CF9071DJMJ", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "It has been a great camera, meeting all my interest in having a very small and lightweight SLR camera with professional features.  I would recommend it to others, with one small reservation.  The default noise reduction filter setting is too aggressive and significantly softens fine detail in photos.

It is very easy to use, with all switches in the right places.the E410 is for armature and pro alike so its excellent entry level DSLR. With Panasonic and lieca adopting their four third system, the future is bright.Drawback of that system Chinese made and the AF only three (comparing to 9 in canon 400D)If you can pay little extra, go for the E510 its even better", "Date": "September 9, 2007"}, {"Title": "Great camera for the price", "Author": "thren0dy", "ReviewID": "RR5KQN38LGU47", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I've only had this camera about a month, but so far, I am really happy with it.  It's small, lightweight, and easy to use.  It takes great pictures in both bright and low light.The only reason I give this 4 starts out of 5 is that the operation can be a little slow, especially when making long exposures - there seems to be quite a delay in the time between when the shutter closes to when it displays your image, but other than that, this camera is perfect.I am a fan of film myself, and for any serious work I will probably always use film.  I bought this camera for a photography class, and it's great for taking photos that turn out beautifully and are quickly and easily transferred to a class computer to turn in.", "Date": "March 15, 2008"}, {"Title": "Best SLR for this price.", "Author": "missy \"Snowflake311\"", "ReviewID": "R13YO7ZZBELOI7", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I have had my e410 for a few days now.  I read some different reviews on it.  All of them had nothing but good things to say about this camera. With in a day I knew what all the settings are and how to use it all manually.  At first I was scared that there was too much.  I picked up the manual and looked it over.  The manual is Great. It explains every thing from what SLR stand for to focusing.  Very user friendly with your trusting manual by your side you will have it all figured out in a day.I love all the different settings to pick from.  I love the size.  Its small but light it fits well in my hands.  My husband said \"it's so small and light, but has grips in all the right places I can hold it all day.\"  He has bigger hands then me and still found it comfortable.The Live LCD screen is nice but I like to use the eye piece better for focusing. All the buttons are in the right places. The photo quality is great.  With the software they give you allows you to put together panoramic photos.  I LOVE THAT.The manual focus is not like others.  It's better for just fine adjusting.  If you put in on seim automatic this way you can let the camera focus and then tweak it to what you want and that works great.You can't beat the quality for the price. I was looking at Nikons and Cannons. The ones in this price rang did not impress me.  This camera is just as good as the d40.  If not better.I could go on and on about this camera.  I love it and you can't go wrong with it. This is my first DSLR  I moved up from my old 35-mm SLR and this is a great camera to do that with.  I highly recommend the E410 to anyone that wants a good travel DSLR that is fun to use and takes a great photo.", "Date": "August 17, 2008"}, {"Title": "Great for basic enthusiasts", "Author": "Stephanie A.

It's super fast and offers more features than I really need, but is priced well below the nikon and canon base models.  My only gripe is that the flash in low light on auto focus is kind of ridiculous -- it'll shoot out fast strobes for more than 10 seconds before settling into the shot. There's probably a setting that addresses this that I'm just not yet familiar with.", "Date": "December 27, 2007"}, {"Title": "Great Camera!", "Author": "mars198 \"photomars\"", "ReviewID": "R31UZ8QK5JLM8A", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Buy this camera!  I have read reviews that said that this camera was too small.  I am 6'2\" with big hands and I think the size is perfect.  I think some people are stuck in the 35mm film days and don't realize that a digital slr does not have to be like a film slr.  This camera is fast, small, and light.  It takes great pictures.  My other digital slr is a monster compared to this.  I will keep it for some things (sigma sd14) but for most of my photography the e-410 is a perfect fit.  Plus it has a dust removal system which sadly the sigma does not have.  For the price there is nothing else that even comes close.  Unless you are a professional photographer I can't see why you would need more.  Buy this camera!  I got mine from Cameta for $339.00 with the 14-42 lens.

I have used other DSLRs and can say that this is a great camera for the money. The pictures are very crisp and clear especially if you use proper techniques (photography basics) Adjusting the settings took a little practice and a full battery to learn, but once you get the hang of it, it isn't overly complicated (read the manual before poking buttons). Although I seldom use the Auto setting on DSLR's I use it to guage the overall quality of the camera based on how well the images come out. The images I took with the Auto setting were clear and did not require much touch up. (impressive for a camera at this price level). With proper lenses you can take high quality images that can rival much higher cost point cameras. Even with the stock lens that ships with this camera, you can get a great quality image. For ameteurs, hobbiests, and people looking to make the jump from point and shoot cameras, I would highly recommend Olympus E series cameras. They are cost effective, and of a great durable quality. I would recommend looking into getting a couple of different types of lenses to give you more range and options. I must caveat this by saying if you are just going to be taking pictures recreationally the lens it comes with will more than suffice. I would also invest in a couple of backup batteries and a couple of memory cards so you don't have to stop what you are doing (theme parks, beach, remote shoots...)All in all I would say that you are getting a great camera for buck. I have not used the Canon or Pentax in the same price range so I can't compare them for you, but if you are reading this, you are obviously doing the research. From what I have seen, each of these brands has strengths and weaknesses. Happy hunting.", "Date": "March 9, 2011"}, {"Title": "Great compact DSLR", "Author": "J.

Though, with my 70-300mm on it, it's a monster anyway.  It takes great photos, battery life is great, and I like that it takes multiple storage cards simultaneously.  It's a fantastic product for REALLY short money.  I would recommend to anyone who wants to upgrade from a point and shoot.  This camera WILL open you world wide.  The only thing that's lacking is image stab, but the 510 or 520 are easy upgrades for the future if you decide you want it.

I've researched extensively on the DSLR cameras before buying this camera and am very happy with my purchase.When I was researching for my first DSLR, my main concerns were size, price and live view options (among some others). And this camera excels for all these. It is the smallest and the lightest DSLR camera on the market today. Price is the best you can get for a DSLR, perhaps the cheapest. And live view is a big plus although you most likely end up not using it all the time because of the shutter lag.So, it is very capable camera and picture quality is superb. However it always needs some adjustments so are you an auto-settings-person you are better off with a DSLR-like compact camera rather than a real DSLR.My only complaint about this camera is its poor LCD screen quality. The colors look very very dull so much that you don't realize how wonderful the actual photograph is when seen on the computer screen. I also have a Panasonic Lumix TZ3 and perhaps I have been spoiled with its superb screen quality.This is again a very capable camera and, especially for starters I don't think there is a better option than this one (as it is the cheapest camera with quite nice tool set).", "Date": "July 20, 2008"}, {"Title": "Great Starter dslr Camera", "Author": "Marlene", "ReviewID": "RZ16XKI2CWY0P", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Even though this is a slightly older model, it is a great starter dslr camera.  I bought this last January as my first dslr camera.  I chose it because it was 10mp unlike other starters which were fewer.  It also had good ratings despite not being as popular as other brands.  What sealed the deal was that it was lighter than a lot of other dslr cameras.  I have not been disappointed.  The pictures I have taken have turned out great using a variety of lenses.  Its menus and features are easy to use and you can switch lenses quickly.  Being small and lightweight, I can take it almost anywhere without it being a strain on my neck and shoulders.

The great thing about the Olympus DSLR's over other brands is that they are very compact and with Olympus's fine range of lenses available(and other brands including Leica and Sigma lenses that fit the 4/3rds standard) it is capable of very good results overall.However, if one starts to purchase good quality accessories for a particular brand/system one starts to make a commitment to the future use of that system and I am not sure if I would continue to build a pro system around the Four Thirds standard due ti it's limitations.However, if you are looking for a compact DSLR that is capable of good quality results then the Olympus range is well worth a look.", "Date": "July 8, 2010"}, {"Title": "Olympus E-410", "Author": "V.
