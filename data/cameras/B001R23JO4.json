{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Great outdoor camera", "Author": "Tod P. Zechiel", "ReviewID": "R1XVDO6SEBD7T0", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I purchased this camera for outdoor use while kayaking. I have no intention of using it underwater, but having lost two cameras to water damage; I opted for something waterproof.Pluses:  1. The function buttons are tops - easy to find and press.  2. With tapered edges, the camera goes in my pocket easily.  3. Movie audio surprizingly good.  4. Multiple digital pixel settings - as low as 100 KB for  photos at the lowest setting - I e-mail my dad photos, he has  dial-up so short attachments are critical.  5. Photo quality color and resolution is good, including macro.  6. LCD display is good, even in strong sunlight  7. Menu choices are fairly intuitive.  8. Battery life seems good so far.  9. SD card - not that many waterproof cameras allow the use of  the common SD card.Minuses  1. Indoor shots are have noise.  2. No hardcopy, comprehensive manual, just an unbound, brief  multifolded paper.  The comprehensive manual is on a CD.  Then again, if you are around water, FUJI may figure you  aren't going to take a paper manual with you.  3. Propriety USB cable for downloads - yet another cable to  keep seperate from a dozen other propriety cables me and my  family has.Summary: The camera exceeds my expectation for outdoor use.  Granted, the photos in lower light settings have some noise, but most of my photos are in bright daylight.  If I am going to an indoor event with low light, I'll take my Canon that is not waterproof.", "Date": "March 28, 2009"}, {"Title": "Buy it for vacation, but use it for every day", "Author": "SUSAN LIENESCH \"akamaisue\"", "ReviewID": "R3LDD2PL0N7OBT", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I bought this camera to take with me snorkeling in Hawai'i, and to use as a backup camera to my Olympus 20x zoom camera. When i first took it out in Kahalu'u Bay on the Big Island, I was amazed at what this little camera could do. It's so easy to operate underwater and takes great movies and pics. Seals are watertight and body is very sturdy. Good battery life considering how much I used it every day of my trip. I took it to a manta ray night snorkel and got some once-in-a-lifetime videos (see my youtube vid at [...]) and was glad the small size made it a great still shot backup when I ran out of batteries in my Olympus. The cool green color and nice quality vids and photos got noticed by quite a few tourists and locals on my trip. The camera's still photo quality is just fine for everyday shooting. Snap one of these beauties up now and never leave home without it.", "Date": "May 28, 2009"}, {"Title": "Hawaii Amazing", "Author": "Nancy Walker", "ReviewID": "R1CDW5WB40BHFW", "Overall": "5.0",

I was in Hawaii in January and used the underwater capabilities of this cute LITTLE, amazingly easy to use camera. I was surprised to hear the footage of the whales underwater BETTER than I heard them in real life, AWESOME. Please watch and listen to the turtle with the whales screaming in the background, I didn't think underwater was so noisy!!! I also caught some pretty amazing photos of rainbows, even far away ones. This camera is as sweet as the price!", "Date": "March 9, 2010"}, {"Title": "GREAT camera for a lot of things", "Author": "Shandel \"Shan\"", "ReviewID": "R281H44ANKZT61", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I have used this camera underwater and on top. Sunsets and sunrises. I really like the way it handles and shoots. Very easy to figure out the settings. The easiest camera I've used so far and I've been shooting for 40 years. Sometimes I just don't want to think about settings but know I can get a great photo. I can with this camera.It's fun taking a video going down a water slide!One thing about digital is pushing the card to it's limit. I got a 4Gig. card and place the settings at the least amount of photos so it has the best quality photo. I can still get over 600 photos to this card! The other important thing is to make sure you hold the shooting button down for a few secs. so the digital camera can auto focus. If you don't photos will be blured or grainy.I would recomend this to anyone looking for a great waterproof camera.", "Date": "May 14, 2009"}, {"Title": "An amazing and outstanding camera", "Author": "C. Ochsner", "ReviewID": "R1N9W7CMI7LKNF", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "If you're a novice at photography and want to take pictures either out of or under water, you couldn't ask for a bettter camera.  Especially for the price.  Either the people who gave this camera a bad review didn't know how to use it, they have too high a expectation, or are expert photographers who may need a more expensive camera.  Or perhaps their camera just didn't work properly.I wasn't expecting a lot from this camera based on the price and some reviews, but because of some of the shared photos, I decided to give it a try.  If it didn't work, I at least didn't spend a whole lot.  What I got was an amazing camera for a great price. I'm an extremely picky person and it takes a lot to impress me, but that is exactly what this camera did.  Since I was snorkeling and floating on top of the water bobbing up and down, fighting against the current and using mostly the zoom feature my expectation was a lot of blurred pictures.  So much so, that I wasn't even eager to get back to the ship to load the pictures onto my laptop to see what I got.  When I finally was mentally set for a big disappointment I loaded my pictures onto my laptop.  What I saw couldn't have surprised or excited me more.  The pictures were beautiful and the movies I took were phenomenal.  If you are a novice or a intermediate photographer, I highly, highly recommend this camera especially if you want to take underwater photos.  I think it does great out of the water too.  I have uploaded a few of the pictures I took so you can check those out.  My two disappointments were that it was overcast (Fugifilm has no control over that)and I think some of the photos would have been better had the sun been out showing off all the colors of the fish and coral.  And that the camera is only good for 3 meters under water.  So I wasn't able to swim to the bottom of the ocean with it to take pictures.  I had to stay on the surface.  Regardless, it had the zoom that worked perfectly.  One other nice thing was that I didn't have to worry about it if it rained or got wet while out on the ocean.", "Date": "October 21, 2009"}, {"Title": "4 Stars for a \"Water-Proof\" Digital Camera", "Author": "A. Bailey", "ReviewID": "R38SR8GIYC3G1S", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I want to start by saying that I am giving this camera 4 stars for a \"waterproof camera\"; with that in mind comparing this with other similarly priced non-water cameras I would probably rate this camera with a 2 1/2 to 3 star rating.This is actually my mom's camera, but I borrowed it over July 4th for a trip to amusement/water park. For the purpose of using it under water/around water I was impressed. The pictures came out surprisingly well. Other than that, though, I actually switched to my camera (Cannon Powershot SX100) for the non-water parts of the trip because the picture quality is much superior.Pros:*Underwater use is great, especially for a lower-priced digital camera*The automatic flash is very quick, unlike some cameras that automatically do the \"three-flash\" thing ... you don't miss any actions shots*Large display screen*CompactCons:*For having 10MP the out-of-water-pictures are very unimpressive (my camera is 8MP and takes exceedingly better pictures in all light settings)*The buttons are crammed into the right side (to afford more display screen room) but makes the buttons a little complicated. Further, the layout of the buttons do not feel very well thought out*In the playback mode, scrolling through pictures has a slideshow effect, which is annoying because there is a noticeable lag between each picture*This camera does not adjust well to light settings. My mom just went to the beach this weekend on a very sunny day and all the pictures appeared blown out.*Videos are even more grainy than the picturesOverall, if you need a cheap, waterproof digital camera this may be a good buy. But, if you're just looking for a digital camera that you will occasionally use for water, I would sugest buying a better regular digital camera and investing in the disposable digital under-water cameras the once or twice you want water pictures. The picture quality is too poor if you plan on using this mostly for non-water pictures.", "Date": "July 8, 2009"}, {"Title": "a Little giant!", "Author": "Alex Vox", "ReviewID": "R8M9RN7PTTFKR", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This camera is small, very nice sitting in your hand, takes nice pictures and goes under water! For as long as you know what to expect from little cam, this Fuji's baby is super sleek, stylish, very easy to handle, the buttons are very nice to the touch and superbly organized.Must say the lens is very sharp. I tested it under water and it works great.It also has dedicated movie button that is very convenient. In short it is great little cam that sits in my pocket and instantly available!", "Date": "March 21, 2009"}, {"Title": "Image noise", "Author": "whoareyou", "ReviewID": "R2BVYFTP104K1O", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "The physical characteristics of this camera do not disappoint, but so far I am unhappy with the image quality.For comparison purposes I own an Olympus E-520 D-SLR and my previous point-and-shoot camera was a Casio EX-S500 from around three years ago.  I was very happy with the Casio, but someone accidentally dropped it hard and it broke, so I intend to replace it with this camera.The tiny size and lightweightness of the Fuji Z33 WP are perfect for pocket portability.  Its shape also has a much higher coolness factor than many of the standard boxy designs.  It definitely feels smaller than I imagined it would.  The interface is simple and easy to use.  The buttons remind me of car stereo head units I had in the mid-90s.  They are kind of rubbery and very pleasant to use, but they feel as if after a few years you might wear them out and accidentally poke a hole in the rubbery surface that covers the underlying button mechanisms.  I imagine that this would leave the camera with an area vulnerable to water.  The battery/memory card door seems well-constructed and you must open a latch, slide the door, and then swing it open to access the innards.  The waterproof gasket appears secure and I feel that the door design is well-engineered.  Under the door is a port which appears to be proprietary and uses a supplied cable to connect to a USB port on your computer.  This port is used to transfer pictures and videos to a different location immediately without installing any software.Also under the door is the battery which must be removed for charging.  I must say that I really like the battery charger.  It is a platform about 2x3.5x0.5\" and it does not require a cord.  Prongs swing out from the back and you plug the charging platform directly into the wall.  It might not be convenient on a power strip because it would take up extra room, but I really like that there is not another extra cord for the charger.  It is very sleek and easy to pack.The majority of the camera is plastic which makes it so lightweight, but it seems relatively sturdy short of drop-testing it.  I would say that I have medium-sized male hands and this camera is pretty small to hold.  I personally prefer this characteristic because I'm looking for a camera that I can take everywhere with me.  I have my D-SLR for camera-specific outings, but I want something small and light to take with me everywhere from bars and parties to outdoor activities like snowboarding and mountain biking.  The size of the camera definitly meets my requirements, but I can see that it might be hard to hold for someone with larger hands.  Also, until you get used to it, you must be careful not to cover the lens with a finger, but I understand that this is normal for this camera category.  The On/Off button is recessed so that it isn't pressed accidentally and the shutter feels natural and requires a standard amount of pressure to activate.The menu system gives the basic options and doesn't waste space with convoluted choices.  It also gives clear explanations of the scene modes to help you decide which one to use.  The auto-scene-recognition can be engaged if you don't want to keep the picture-taking process as simple as possible.  Overall, the menu was very easy to navigate and nothing seemed confusing.I have not evaluated the underwater capabilities of this camera.  I was only interested in getting a waterproof camera so that I could go out in the rain or take it snowboarding and not worry about moisture.  I do not plan to use it underwater on purpose.So far, I have only taken indoor shots in medium light.  It appears that many cameras can take decent outdoor shots due to the better lighting, so my personal test is indoor shots.  Also, I intend to use the camera frequently in party and bar settings, so this becomes even more important.  The Z33 WP claims to have scene-recognition and should be a very automatic camera for beginner users.  With and without a flash, my pictures show excessive image noise.  I thought it might be the typical ISO-boost, so I manually forced the ISO lower.  There is still so much noise when I display the pictures full-size on a computer screen that I am very disappointed.  The videos are smooth and have very impressive sound, but they also appear to be filled with the same image noise.  I will try to post pictures on an update, but I feel bad that I can't produce anything decent to look at.  I'm hoping that it is simply my fault and I will keep trying for now, but a fully automatic point-and-shoot should make the process of taking a clear picture simple, right?  I know that better lighting will help, but this is too poor for my needs.  I am considering exchanging the camera for a different one.  I am considering the Olympus 550WP or one of the Olympus Tough series.  I know that Oly waterproof cameras aren't known for great image quality, but I'm hoping they have to be better than this Fuji.In conclusion, my 5MP Casio P&S; took much, much clearer pictures than this camera and I would be embarrassed to show these indoor pictures I have taken to anyone.  I will be looking for a different camera.", "Date": "March 22, 2009"}, {"Title": "Doesn't deliver on what it promises.", "Author": "Chad Baker \"darkbeach72\"", "ReviewID": "R2Q7243QCXH4N5", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I'm an easy grader and love to give positive reviews of products that perform well. So please think seriously about what I say before buying this product. I am a photography and graphics professional, but I'm really only judging this camera against my expectations for similar products in this class. [The most recent point and shoot camera that I've owned was a Panasonic Lumix DMC-FX8 5MP, purchased in 2006.]Cons:1)Poor image quality. Not worthy of the name/reputation that Fuji has earned through years of superior film products. Images are grainy in nearly all but perfectly bright outdoor settings. For digital photo professionals, I'm referring to chromatic noise in excess of anything I've seen in the last 5 years or so. I'm almost baffled that the sensor could be so poor. Indoor shots are terrible. It's almost impossible to get this camera to shoot a focused picture in anything other than midday sun or with a harsh flash that washes out the image. All shooting conditions being equal, I would prefer to have a 5 megapixel image from my Lumix rather than a 10 megapixel image from the Fuji FinePix.2)Waterproofing fails. I read a review right after I bought this camera that said that the user had experienced a problem with moisture behind the LCD display. I hoped that her experience was atypical. Unfortunately, I had the same experience. On day 9 of a 10 day trip to Mexico, the camera developed a moisture problem that affected both the LCD display and the lens. Images were completely fogged and unacceptable. I had to fully dry the camera (try that in 100% tropical humidity) in order to get it to de-fog.3)Long time (few seconds) to display image after shutter press. Can be a bit frustrating when action happens.4)Not enough manual control for iso/shutter speed/flash in difficult lighting conditions, which for this camera are most lighting conditions. I had better fine controls on my Lumix, three years ago.

You'll find yourself trying to create a dark shadow with your other hand in order to see what you're doing, and even then it's hard to read.Pros:1)Flotation strap really works.2)Fun, easy and convenient.3)Interesting advances features like face recognition that I didn't get a chance to fully test because of Con #2 above.4)Video.I purchased this camera just before our trip to Mexico, because of the waterproof feature and because I wanted a fast/fun/easy backup to my professional grade Canon 5D mkII. I returned it immediately after the trip because of the internal moisture issue. The camera was never subjected to conditions outside of its stated range. It wasn't dropped, crushed or shocked. The deepest that camera was ever in the water was about 5 feet. We went snorkeling with it about 5 times and shot some fairly good underwater photos. Never exceeded the camera's rated depth.In conclusion, this was a camera that I really wanted to love and rave about, but the main purpose of a camera is not all the fluff and jazzy features. It's taking pictures. This camera just takes lousy pictures. The sensor creates images that are high in megapixels but otherwise more like a cell phone camera than a nice point and shoot. And its one hallmark feature, being waterproof, failed after about a week of what I would consider normal use by responsible, careful adults. I returned mine and am looking for another point-and-shoot to replace it. This could have been an AMAZING product if the sensor was better and the waterproofing didn't fail. It's a fun little camera with a really convenient form factor and easy controls, this pics just aren't good.", "Date": "September 6, 2009"}, {"Title": "Buy for the waterproof/ruggedness, not photo quality", "Author": "S.

Wiklanski \"reading rider\"", "ReviewID": "R3J464MRCKS2XO", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I bought this camera as a secondary camera to take on vacation to Hawaii, basically I wanted a camera that could withstand the water and beach so I didn't have to risk damage to my main camera and also to take underwater snorkeling.Initially I was impressed with the camera, the ergonomics were good, size was right and the texture of the body seemed like it would be easy to grip wet. I also liked the buttons on the back, large and like a cell-phone touchpad, again, seemed much easier to use in the water. I was not excited to give up a viewfinder but it seems that they are a relic of the past in the point and shoot world; too bad. I liked the camera enough to buy it. I bought it with enough time to try it out before traveling, I'm glad  did.I took the camera on a day trip to the west side of Michigan on a cloudy and sprinkling afternoon. Right away one aspect of the camera began to mildly frustrate me, the shutter release button. The button is very stiff, so much so that I was constantly worried that pressing the button with enough force to actually take the picture would cause the image to be blurry. I suppose it may be good to prevent mistaken images but I found it frustrating. Another issue with the camera is that the lens is covered by glass however the glass is only slightly recessed from the front of the camera meaning that the glass is highly prone to smudges and fingerprints, annoying, much worse that other cameras. While using it I felt like I got the hang of it and didn't panic when a wave came crashing in, soaking me and the camera. I was starting to overlook the shutter button and the lens smudging issues;UntilWhen I got home I loaded the images into Photoshop Elements and right away noticed that the images were quite washed out, not a lot of contrast and exposures were definitely off. No matter, I went to work editing but immediately noticed that the corners of the images were extremely blurry, and quite a bit darker, almost like a circular soft focus filter was in place, not what I was hoping for. I then started to look more closely at the images and it wasn't just the corners that were distorted, objects in the image were surrounded with blue lines! Yes, it was like each object in the image had been traced with a thin neon blue pen! At first I thought this was on just pictures taken in lower light but then realized that it was in all the pictures in varying degrees; this combined with the out of focus corners and poor exposure were only made worse by visible graininess across any image where the zoom was at its full length. Basically, despite some compositions that I really liked, every picture is unsuitable for printing.Sure, if I want to only look at the pictures as thumb nails or very small, definitely not larger than 2\"x3\" then the images could almost be considered passable, anything larger, say your normal 4\"x6\" print, yo will be greatly disappointed! Needless to say the camera was boxed up and returned for an exchange, now I've got an Olympus that I'm going to try out and see, my expectations are low, but I'm hoping just the same. I'm just glad I found out now rather than after my vacation.Bottom line is this; this is without a doubt an awful camera. I am shocked that Fuji would actually sell this camera, my first digital point and soot (bought in 2000 with 4 megapixels) takes better pictures than this.

The float strap that comes with the camera is great (Target sells the camera with the silicon cover and the float strap for $159.99).  We would throw the camera to each other in the water to take pictures and the float strap keeps the camera afloat.3. Pictures turn out nice when lighting is good and when you hold the camera steadily (my Canon PowerShot SD750 takes more consistently crisp pictures)4. The flash was powerful enough to take great underwater picturesCons:1. The zoom is not powerful enough2. Pictures turns out blurry when lighting is not good3. Bad night time pictures with no tripods4. The lense is not covered.  Before taking pictures, you'll need to make sure the lense is clean or you'll see streaks or blurry marks on your pictures5. The camera response is slow between commands/picturesOverall, this is a great waterproof camera for the purpose of taking pictures under water and for places you would not want to get your regular camera dirty (e.g., beach, water park).  This is definitely a great 2nd camera to take with you.  I would not recommend this for your primary camera.*****UPDATE****We took this camera to our Costa Rica vacation and it's great for water sports.  We took it to our waterfall rappelling excursion and it was great!

The features seemed to be amazing and the previous reviews were mostly excellent, so we were stoked...until it arrived.Our biggest problem with this camera is that it does not take good pictures at all.  We took several photos with it out of the box and every one came out slightly blurry.  The first night we blamed the less than perfect indoor lighting conditions and kept our hopes up.  That didn't last.The following day we took several outside shots with optimal sunlight and still the pictures were not crisp and sharp.

I bought this camera because I wanted to take underwater pictures for a vacation in Hawaii. Since I was experimenting with underwater photography, I did't want to spend too much - just in case, this didn't work out. But it turns out, I had nothing to worry about! I just returned from Hawaii. Most of my trip (1 week long) was spent by the beach or in the water. This camera was so durable and easy to use. I took over 600 pictures (using a separately purchased 8 GB memory card) and the camera battery only needed recharging 1x the whole trip!  All of my friends were awed by the camera and are planning to get one for themselves.I looked at some of the other reviews on here. A small number commented that they did not like the picture quality. I personally find it fanatastic. The picture quality setting can be changed from 10 MB down to much less, as needed. I kept my setting at 10 MB. The pictures when transferred onto my computer looked great and were comparable to other camera pictures of the same type but different brand (Nikkon, Sony, Cannon). (My house owns a lot of cameras.)  The waters in Maui were generally very clear, but even so it was necessary to hold the camera close in order to get good shots under water. I would estimate the camera has a 3 ft visibility range under regular salt water.  Even with this range, I was able to get clear shots as long as I held the camera close to the subject matter. I bet visibility would improve in pool water or truly clear water. (I'm a little jet lagged now so I may upload my pics at a later date.)I also noticed that a few people claimed the camera did not work and broke. I can only comment according to my personal experience. According to the instructions, you have to make sure that the battery slot & memory card slot clicks closed. Just slide the slot until you hear a faint noise. The inside of the camera obviously is not waterproof, just the outside is coated with some material to help keep water out. The casing must be closed tight to prevent water from seaping into the electronics.Also, a few people mentioned the shutter delay. There is a fraction of a second delay, but I find that unless you get a SLR you will probably experience delay in most handheld digital point and shoots. The delay is comparable to other cameras of a similiar type, and in general, I would say somewhat better if not on the same level with most other point and shoots.This is overall a great light weight little camera, especially given the price. If you want to take fun vacation photos and not have to worry too much about theft or water damage, I would buy and have bought this camera.  I LOVE IT!

I looked at every waterproof camera available and narrowed it down to the Cannon D10 and the Fujifilm WP Z33.  However, i quickly realized nothing can compare to this Fujifilm and i will tell you why:First off, the Canon is WAY too big to fit in your pocket, so you could pretty much only use it in the water because you would never carry it around on land.  Also, it is MUCH more expensive than the Fujifilm and these days electronics usually don't last longer than four years anyways so why pay that much?The Fujifilm did an amazing job on my trip.  It took great pictures underwater and on land.  I bought it hoping it could be my all around camera and it is doing a great job!  It has great picture settings and the video quality is excellent for this little camera.  I read some other reviews saying how water got into it but I think people just did not follow the rules.  For starters, do NOT go more than 3 meters under no matter what (don't say \"I am sure it can go deeper they are just saying that to be safe.\")  Also, make sure you soak it in fresh water for 5 minutes after you use it and wipe it dry afterwards...if you do that then you will be fine.I am very impressed with this camera...the buttons are easy to use underwater and it is lightweight and easy to transport.  The only negative is that the pictures take a little long to switch when you are reviewing them on the camera...but i am just nitpicking here.Ultimately, if you are looking for an underwater camera this is the one to buy.

However, it is not standard USB on the camera end.  I don't know what one would call it - I thought it was proprietary at first, but my wife proved me wrong by using it with ALL our cameras.This camera does not have the best quality, indoors or out.  But it has GOOD quality.  Just look at customer pictures to get an idea.However, this thing works GREAT as a childproof/outdoor/beach camera.  I dropped it and placed it under water.  Still works!  I bought this camera with a starter kit for 179.99 - it comes with a rubber sleeve which keeps it from scratching.  This camera is slick, too.  It's very thin and few buttons make it easy to operate.  The battery is rechargeable li-ion.  The bundle I purchased it with also comes with a flotation device to attach to the camera.  So now, when we're at the pool, I just attach the flotation grip and throw it in the water when people want to use it.  Then, when they're done, they just throw it back on the deck - doesn't matter if I catch it or not!If you're looking for a camera to take with you on outdoor adventures, birthday parties, or even to disneyworld, this is the best you can get. The low price is just a bonus!  if you're looking for something to use for your photography classes, you may want to pass.", "Date": "August 31, 2009"}, {"Title": "Excellent price for underwater

The first time we went to the Bahamas, we purchased disposable cameras which were ok but we spent over $50 on 4 cameras and another $40 on developing.  Over half of the pictures were blurry and I ended up throwing most of them away.  I read the reviews and saw that the quality wasn't great but I thought it would be better than wasting money on disposables again.  The pictures were EXCELLENT!  only a couple were too blurry to send to print.  Shots taken underwater (cloudy & sunny), in the shade, bright sunshine, cloudy...all perfect! The dark shots didn't turn out very well but I didn't have time to look at the settings.  The video is neat but at this price, it doesn't include a stablilzer so takes some practice to get a stable video.  The clarity is great on the video too!  The video attached was taken by my 13 year old!I would recommend this camera for convenience.  On previous trips, I would have to carry a large heavy camera bag with my high end Canon Digital camera & different lenses, a bulky digital video camera, underwater disposables and then worry that they would be stolen or ruined.  This camera is grab and go!  It was so nice to only carry a credit card and 1 camera when we went ashore. I took almost 1000 pictures and videos and had to delete only a handful.  I now carry it in my purse so I have it with me all the time!No Complaints for the $95 I paid for this camera!", "Date": "July 18, 2010"}, {"Title": "Fabulous low-priced waterproof camera", "Author": "A. Pecorella", "ReviewID": "RM25G5Y837RU1", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This is an easy 5-star review to give for the price.  We bought to camera for a trip that included snorkeling, and it was absolutely fantastic.  We got lots of great underwater pics, but we even ended up using it for lots of dry pictures too.  It has a surprising number of cool features for such an inexpensive camera, including face recognition, a ton of scene settings (including wet ones like beach, snow, and underwater), a decent zoom, 640x480 movies, and an impressive boot-up time of about 2 seconds.  We kept finding new little features throughout the trip.  It's not a professional camera at all, but it's a great point-n-shoot.  It's also brilliant for dirty places like a beach, since if you get it sandy or dirty you can just dunk it in water and wash it off.  We used to carefully bring a nicer point-n-shoot to the beach and keep it in a plastic bag the whole time.  Now, we're much more relaxed and less paranoid about dropping the camera, which really is fantastic.  We still use a nicer camera when we want great photos, but for casual shots or vacations this is our goto gadget now.The only downsides we've seen: we occasionally had focus issues in movies and point-n-shoot (though holding halfway before shooting generally fixed this), we once saw some condensation on the inside of the screen (not sure if this is indicative of a problem or can just happen when it gets really hot), and it's only rated to 10 feet deep, so there were a few times when I couldn't dive down with it as far as I wanted without risking compromising the seals.  It also can be a little slow sometimes when going through pictures, though the super-zoomed-out thumbnail view (with probably 50 images visible at a time) is really slick for quickly finding shots in a large bunch.Memory cards are dirt cheap (we got the Kingston 4 GB Class 4 SDHC Flash Memory Card SD4/4GB and it worked great).  I'd also recommend the Fujifilm Z33WP Neoprene Weatherproof Sport Case as a cheap, simple case for the camera.  Doesn't have room for accessories, but will protect in transit and even floats if you drop it in the water.  We were fine on one battery, though we charged it each night after heavy use.  It seemed to drain pretty quickly with video, so it might be worth having a second battery, except that keeping that second battery dry could be a pain (which is why we didn't bother).  In any case, I highly recommend this as a cheap waterproof for casual vacation pictures, or perhaps a high-end camera for kids (who are old enough to be trusted to not open the battery door).  Photophiles might find things wrong with the color or picture quality, but for average users I think it it's perfect.  Plus, the metallic color is purdy.  :)", "Date": "June 26, 2010"}, {"Title": "I really like it", "Author": "Juan F.

It isnt shockproof so clumsy kids beware!Testing the unit lead me to see that the best pictures were taken when outside but indoor pictures were not too bad. The pictures came out better on my computer than the LCD showed. The buttons feel really cool to the touch. The battery door is a little tricky to figure out but it does have to be waterproof. The video function is pretty good and catches good sound.Overall, the camera is a lot of fun for what it is.

And the camera is durable (which is why we let the kids use it :) The only thing I could say as far as a \"down side\" is the battery loses some of its charge in really cold water (68 degrees), BUT the battery WILL recharge itself if you keep it out of the cold for a few minutes. At any rate, all around I give this camera a 10!!!! I literally have thousands of dollars worth of photography equipment and this little camera is my favorite grab and go. GREAT BUY!!!

I got it on a cruise for around $209 but I also got the accessory package with it and also a 1G memory card. I think I got a decent deal. I was in need of a camera so it was a good deal at the time especially because I wanted to take some pictures while we were snorkeling I didn't get the Olympus because it didn't take the standard SD card and I liked the cute PINK color of the Fuji.The salesman explained to me that there were two things to be cautious of. And after reading the review from other people I think it is important warn people who are purchasing this camera of these things. The camera is designed to be water and weather resistant, etc. But some of the reviews mentioned that water got into the camera and it is probably because the user did not secure the hinge on the battery/memory compartment. The salesman emphasized over and over again that if the lock button isn't on there is a possibility water can get inside and then you damage the camera. There isn't anything wrong with the camera, it is actually user error. Not a defective product. Also, some other people mentioned that that buttons were wearing. Again, the salesman emphasized that you have to rinse off the camera after using it underwater especially in chlorine pools or salt water. This makes sense because both chlorine and salt water are extremely corrosive! ***Lock the battery compartment and rinse your camera EVERY USE!*** (I'm certain the user manuals mention this but who really reads them?!?)With that being said, I have been doing those two exact things and have no problem with the camera. I love the camera!!!! It is so easy to use. Just point and shoot type of thing. Not complicated at all. Buttons on the display are easy to use.Also, I am really happy I got the accessory package. It definitely has helped me protect the camera. The package also comes with a nifty flotation device so if you are swimming with your camera and you happen to drop it - it won't sink to the bottom. I highly recommend getting it. It has been a lifesaver.Well, I was so pleasantly surprised with the pictures while snorkeling. Everyone in my family asked me for the pictures later. They kept telling me to bring the camera every time we went for our outdoor excursions because they were too worried about damaging their own cameras! My dad thought I wasted my money until he saw the pictures. (That Christmas I got him the same camera in blue!)Later, I took my new camera to Hawaii and now really enjoy looking at videos of me and my bf snorkeling with sea turtles! This beats any old school underwater camera I have used before. The microphone on the camera is decent too. You can even hear the bubbles in the background in all the underwater vids which is neat. He really wasn't convinced that the camera was any good. He has a Cannon and loves it. But his is not underwater so once he realized how fun it was to take videos of the coral reef with the Fuji he was hooked and begging to hold the camera. (I find his Cannon too complicated for me to be honest! I prefer the easy use of the Fuji. I know I am biased but I do love this camera!!!)So there are a few cons to this camera. The camera cord is not standard which other users mentioned. This I agree is a little annoying as I am the type of person who often misplaces cords like that. So to make up for this the camera takes a standard SD card so I just use an SD reader. Problem solved there. Also, the battery life could be better. The video mode drains the battery quickly. So one thing I always have to remind myself whenever I am about to go on a special event to charge the battery right before we go. Someone also mentioned that they didn't like how you could only charge the battery by taking out and not with a cord. To explain this, I think because it is a waterproof camera and to make it waterproof the exterior and interior have to be more simplified so that there are no extra gears and divots, etc where water could get into potentially. Lastly, the picture quality isn't the greatest at night (great during perfect lighting conditions) and sometimes the camera is slow. For these issues I was able to resolve them by adjusting how I take the pictures. I often suppress the flash so that it doesn't wash out the pictures and I try to anticipate the pictures. But these are all minor qualms compared to how much fun and use I have gotten out of the camera. Plus, it's so affordable! It's a good deal for the money spent. I have recommended this camera to numerous people who have been camera shopping. I would def upgrade to the new model if my dies but so far so good not one issue!

Sorry about the thumb. The video came out 100% perfect but did not transfer over well to Amazon.I took this camera to Six flags and went into the water and down the slides with the camera all day long. Worked Great!Went to the beach and also performed 100%.  Camera is small enough to fit into a pocket and comes with a wrist strap that I used in the water.  Very easy to set up and install battery and card.  easy transfer to computer to download photos.The camera does come with a quick set up guide which is really all that is needed.

The idea was to have something to take snapshots etc. The waterproof feature was a bonus but this camera never made it into the pool. After about 6 months the LCD just quit. Turn the camera on and nothing. So, as some on here have mentioned, you fill out forms, pay postage, and wait....and wait....and wait. Finally, 3 weeks later I recieved an email that my camera had been recieved and that I would be notifiied of their decision to repair or replace with a referbished camera in 10 business days. Well, then I waited...and waited...and waited again. Today, I recieved a repair estimate for $85.52! That's right, they want me to pay for their camera again! The estimate states that the LCD is cracked and that the body has \"minor wear\". Not that it will make any difference, but I have pictures of the camera, from every angle, taken the day I packet it off to them. There was not a scratch on the camera as it had been in a protective case since the day I got it. Even better, the LCD is not cracked in my pictures!Bottom line here folks; spend the extra $50 bucks and buy a Nikon or a Canon.

I was initially looking into a waterproof cover for my Powershot SD1000, but realized that the case would cost more then the camera is probably worth (2 years after I originally bought it.)So after searching for low-cost waterproof digital cameras, I came upon this. Reading reviews here and on cnet.com, I felt it would be worth my money for at least my underwater pictures and video.I took this into the pool a week before my vacation to ensure it'd survive the water. I was surprised at how clear and crisp the pictures came out! The video has an awesome sound feature (although I'm not sure it does much underwater since all you hear is gurgling. It's a great effect though!)Now the ultimate test- Maui! The camera is a bit slow (to turn on, zoom, delete/view pictures) and the functions take a little getting used to, but it takes clear pictures on land and water. I don't know how great the quality is on film or enlarged yet, but on my computer they look just as good as my other camera!The zoom is a bit weak and isn't very clear at the closest zoom (3x). This was not a problem while snorkeling, however- as we're close enough to get clear shots of each other and of the fish!Overall, this is a REALLY fun camera! We enjoyed taking tons of pictures under water and in the waves. For me, pictures are incredibly important and most of my favorite pictures from this trip are from this camera. I HIGHLY recommend this camera!!**Remember to wipe the sand/water spots before taking pictures!****SUPER waterproof! Did not have any leakage problems nor did I even feel paranoid about it. It feels sturdy!****Average battery life - Using this all day (Snorkeling, in the pool, etc.) and it did not die- although I charged every night to make sure I was covered.****MUCH more fun/cost efficient then a disposable waterproof.

The cameras pictures come out clear enough (although I am used to 12+ mega pixels so they did not look as sharp as I am used to).  The camera does take a little longer then higher quality cameras to take a photo, and the shutter speed is not quick enough to take pictures while on the move (for instance while driving above 10MPH) but it does take a nice picture.  I would recommend for anyone looking for a camera to take to the beach/pool, and to use as a secondary camera for those wet conditions.

Unfortunately, with sweat and rain, I can't always take my camera to capture the gorgeous scenery, wildlife, etc. that I encounter on the trails.  My wife purchased this camera for me for Christmas because it was affordable, rated well at the local big box electronic retailer, and waterproof.Please keep in mind that I am comparing it to nearly any current Canon product as I have been and am still using Canon, for years now.10MP?: you'd never know it.  On the LCD, it looks extremely grainy.  For an average size of 4 megabytes, you'd like crisp and clear...and it wasn't.  When loaded onto the computer for editing, it was average at best with no cropping or enhancement.  Any brightening would greatly distort picture and any zooming made the pic look absolutely horrible with pixels everywhere.Battery Life: within TEN pictures on the initial use, the red battery indicator came on.  Keep in mind that I fully charged the battery before initial use as directed.  To put this in comparison, my SD1100 by Canon lasted through 200 pictures and a 5 hour trail marathon in November without even warning me of a low battery.  200 pictures!  That's a lot of turning on and turning off...thus lots of mechanical motion by the camera without dying.  Unacceptable, FUJI!!!Moving people/objects: often, I take pictures of fellow runners while they are...running!  I tried this and they were all blurry.  I quickly realized I couldn't be moving (like I could with the Canon) but even when I froze and tried to capture fellow runners on the run, they were blurry.  The ability for my Canon to capture moving objects or even things like waterfalls is far superior to the FUJI.Delay between pictures:  Again, with Canon it is very quick.  With this camera, there is a long delay between pictures.  Enough said.Powering on the camera: In the winter, I wear gloves.  The super tiny, recessed power button on this FUJI is nearly impossible to push with anything but a pointy finger.  Very frustrating especially when you consider the delay in powering up.  Bad when I see something I want to capture (like wildlife) and I only have moments to do so before they run off.All in all, I am now without a waterproof camera because this FUJI went back very quickly.  There is simply no comparison with Canon.  I recommend any of the ELPH cameras.  They basically have the same features/technology.  Pick any one of them from 8MP to 12MP and I think you'll be very happy.

The colors are great, very strong and vibrant like Fuji film used to deliver. Where the camera falls down is as an indoor everyday unit. My Nikon Coolpix L14 takes much better pictures indoors or in lowlight. The Z33WP gave us grainy, blurred photos with odd texturing. Waiting for the autofocus improved them, but not to the level of my L14 (or an SLR). However, I wouldn't take any of those to the beach or in the pool. (And really, I had no idea how amusing photos of kids blowing air out of their nose could be)  The outdoor shots in full and fading sun were also clean. I got the silicone case because I was concerned about sand. It fit easily and didn't interfere with button use at all.  Overall, really performs for the money. Definitely has a permanent place in the dive bag.Edited 9/2012 - My beloved Z33WP died on a trip to Hawaii after countless trips to waterparks and reefs.

The original plan was to buy a more expensive model.  But we ended up getting this one instead.We are not disappointed at all.  I'm on a three year stay in Hawaii for the Army and on our off days we like to go snorkeling.  So far it has performed admirably.  Underwater shots taken in low light conditions are of mediocre quality but ones taken in full sunlight are superb.  Macro shots are my wife's favorite and on a recent trip to Shark's Cove she was amazed by the quality this camera returned.The video is of that trip.", "Date": "December 12, 2013"}, {"Title": "going strong since 2009", "Author": "Ellis Others", "ReviewID": "RQL4I264DEHH6", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I bought this camera in July of 2009. I have had many, many uses out of it from canoeing trips, to the pool, to the beach, waterslides, skiing, etc. I send my camera into Fuji every year for an inspection (which is free), and so far (knock on wood) I haven't had any problems. This camera takes great outdoor and underwater photos/videos. I would highly recommend this for the outdoorsy person, but if you are looking for a camera to take primarily indoor and people photos, I'd go with something else.I have three complaints about this camera. The first is that the shutter button seems to be difficult for people to use. Every time I ask someone to take a photo, they can't seem to do it. \"which button is it?\", \"do I hold it in?\", \"It's  not working\". ANNOYING. I usually have to ask other people in the group to email me their group/people photos. Which leads me to my second complaint... it doesn't take good photos of people unless you are outdoors with great lighting (on \"auto\" mode). Yes, this camera does have many features that you can change to accommodate to lighting situations, but in real life unless you're a photographer who has time for that? And my third complaint is the lack of zoom, which is a trade off for having a waterproof camera. I took this camera to my brother's football game and all of the players looked like ants.I gave this camera four stars, because even after my complaints, it fits my lifestyle better than any other camera currently on the market in my price range, and it has lasted a lot of abuse. All of my friends rave about my camera, and two of them have bought it after using mine. My nieces and nephews love to play with it in the pool (the camera is durable enough I don't have to worry about the little ones potentially hurting/breaking it). My camera came with an adjustable \"life jacket\" that attaches to the camera and then slides on your arm/wrist. A friend's camera came with a silicon case, but not a life jacket. I'd recommend buying both.The reason I was on Amazon today was to browse for a new camera since mine is getting a little old, but after reading reviews, I will stick with what I have.

I purchased this camera in April 2010 for a whitewater rafting trip that never happened. . . .  Well I just got back from Jamaica this February 2011, and let me tell you, it is a wonderful underwater camera.  Pictures and videos came out great.  I took pictures in the pool without worry, took video while on the Hobie Kate (sailing) and dropped it a few times.  Conintued to worked like a charm.  I would come back to my room hook it up to the TV to reveiw the footage and I almost cried. Memories I couldn't get without it being waterproof.  Literally water splashing in my face and I'm getting a good clear video.  (Remember to wipe the water from the lens.)  I initially was going for the Canon D10 for $250 but took a chance on this one at $120.  The still pictures and video are okay, but I bought it for its underwater capabilities.  I use my Canons for my great quality photographs.  Just make sure you secure the door to the battery and rinse it off after the ocean.  I now am thinking of updating to the Fujifilm XP10 with the 5 optical zoom.  My only problem with this camera, is the microphone is on the top left and as you hold the camera you might cover the microphone up and miss some audio.And don't even worry about the sand.(No more lens error messages). I believe everyone needs an underwater camera.  Also get a floating wrist strap.  Truly worry free. I would recommend the Fujifilm Z33WP.P.S.

Just to compare I got my 9MP Lumix that I bought a couple of years ago and took an identical photo with it and the Fuji.  Both pictures were taken with a flash and with no zoom.  My Lumix pic turned out really well.  It was lit great with no washout and the picture was crisp with lots of detail.  The Fuji pic was horrible.  It was blurry and grainy.  I couldn't make out any detail at all.  A friend suggested that I may have gotten a lemon and to trade it in for a replacement.  But I have to pay return shipping so I just got an RMA number.

The battery did great and the camera is 100% waterproof (even at good depths).  The biggest issues are photo clarity (which I think is difficult for most cameras underwater) and length of time to get the shot.  The shutter is very slow.  You probably need to hold it down for a good 2-3 seconds in order to get the shot and by then the shots are usually long gone.  For example, we were watching dolphins doing tricks coming out of the water.  I must have taken 100 shots and none of them came out because the dolphin had already gone back under.However, I still loved having the camera and would say it was great for the money.  You can also color correct a lot of the photos on a photo site (like Snapfish) so they are a lot crisper.

Gnatz \"Jazz Dr\"", "ReviewID": "R2GIH845B7NK4D", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Overall, I think that this camera has performed very well in the first month I have owned it. I bought it to take to Florida on a spring break trip with the kids. It is very waterproof (no leaks) and took all the abuse that my teenagers could throw at it. It is fun to use under water. The picture quality is good considering the small lens and the fact that people tend to smear their fingerprints on the front glass. A quick wipe with a soft dry towel every once and a while helps with picture quality, I found. Criticisms? A few. The battery life is only fair. I found that I would sometimes have to stop and charge it after only a half day sitting by the pool. Of course, the kids were not only shooting but looking at the pictures on the LCD screen, re-playing movies, etc. It takes about an hour for the battery to charge up again. One of first things that happened was that the LCD screen on the camera got scratched on the first day out - which doesn't affect the picture quality, of course - but I just wish that it had been more resistant to abrasion. Also, there are now several corners on the body where the black enamel is worn off due to being thrown, dropped etc. -  but you get the idea of the type of torture this little camera took and has stood up to astonishingly well so far. Also positive, the menu is very intuitive - you will not miss the paper instruction book if you have any familiarity with digital cameras at all. The delay between the time you press the shutter release and the time that the image is captured seems about average for a point-and-shoot (i.e. slow). But a very cool feature is the bracketing (top 3 frames) option that captures several frames in rapid succession and then lets you pick the best one. I caught the kids in mid-air jumping into the pool easily using this feature - most other cameras at this price (and more) would have missed the shot completely.  Oh, and also being somewhat picky, I wish that the on-off button and the shutter release were not quite so close together - several times I shut the camera down by mistake instead of taking a snapshot until I got used to the proximity of these buttons. Overall though, it seems like the FinePix Z33WP is a nice tough little waterproof kid-proof camera.

It does not look like the typical underwater camera, but it is amazingly water tight.  I highly recommend the clear neoprene cover that comes with the kit, as well as the float wrist strap.  The cover does a good job of protecting it from bumps and the float strap keeps it above water in case it slips out of your hand.

I hesitated to buy it because it was an older model, but it had the best combination of price and good reviews; there was a far less expensive one but it was a no-name brand with too many bad reviews for my liking.  I found the picture quality comparable to that of my Nikkon Cool Pix and a similar Cannon camera I own, despite the lower number of megapixels of this camera (10 MP compared to 11 MP of the Cool Pix, and 14 of the Nikkon). Both cameras held up under water several times. The quality of the underwater pictures were very good, I did not get to use it for snorkeling as much as I'd hoped, as water conditions weren't the best, so I can't vouch for how it photographs colors of fish, etc., but the underwater pictures came out as clear as it looked when I was viewing the water through a mask. As I'd forgotten my regular camera, this was my main camera for the trip and it took great pictures out of the water, as well. I was surprised to find it was easy to adjust settings such as ISO manually to get better pictures at some outdoor nighttime shows. I never even rinsed it with fresh water as directed and the camera still works fine. Only 1 or 2 pictures had water drops on them from failing to dry it before taking a picture outside of the water. Oops.My one and only complaint is that somehow there is now a small crack/hole on the corner of the battery compartment...probably my fault as I dropped it once or twice....obviously this renders it no longer waterproof, although still usable. Also, the wrist strap is incredibly difficult to attach, I helped my friend with hers but lacked the patience required to attach mine, so I'm lucky it didn't fall down a waterfall or sink to the bottom of the ocean.I should note, another friend on the trip bought a slightly more expensive waterproof camera of a different brand...hers went kaput the second it hit the water...we had TWO of these that made it through the whole trip...albeit one no longer waterproof...", "Date": "December 26, 2013"}, {"Title": "Great little waterproof camera!", "Author": "Joy", "ReviewID": "RNFE4WRC3OFUQ", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This is my 2nd camera, same model.

This camera was onsale for a very good price (assuming because of the color) so I couldn't pass it up.  I've taken it in the pool, on the kayak, in the ocean and to the field with no problems.

I hated how quickly my last camera went through expensive camera batteries.  Now I just pop it out and charge it before I head out and not worry about it.Picture quality is pretty good...has it's ups and downs but is still good overall.  Sometimes a bad picture is due to a smudge or water drop on the lens which is easy to wipe off, and just as easy to wipe on with the flush lens.  Also if I try to snap the picture too quickly, before the camera has time to focus... it tends to be blurry.  This is when trying to snap a picture back to back, and could also be due to my unsteadiness.

The camera is also very inexpensive for being water proof, that is a big plus. Solid constructions, it feels solid and well built.The not so good... If you buy it directly from the vendor Adorama instead of here, you will get it cheaper $100. The bad thing, Adorama is not a reputable vendor, the camera they sent me, although it works great, it looked used, not freshly packaged and had finger prints every where.The image quality is inferior, noisy and too punchy (saturated). The images from the A590IS looked more even and natural. I was hoping for stelar battery performance since I was stepping out of the AA batteries, but to my surprise, the battery on this camera doesn't last as much either.The whole interface is kind of weird and very slow, it takes for ever to browse pictures and the interface buttons are very difficult to press, if you have big hands and you are trying to change settings in the middle of a pool or the beach where you hands and the camera are wet, good luck.Other then that, for $100, it is the perfect everyday use little camera, it fits every where and it does what it suppose to, just not a stelar performer.

Look", "ReviewID": "R1Y5HA8GIT2878", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I wanted a durable underwater / beach camera for a trip to Hawaii and didn't want to spend a lot of money.  I had used a cheap used 5 Meg pixel camera in an underwater pouch before.  Worked great, but the sand and salt destroyed to camera.  I decided give this camera a try.The first one was defective.  I sent it back to Fujifilm for warranty repair.  To their credit they simply replaced the camera.Pros:Small and easy to carry.I like the push button setup.  Easy to learn and gets you quickly to where you want to go.Videos were clear and made capturing some fun underwater moments of my kids and nieces.  Just need to remember to prefocus before shooting videos.  Focus on something in the distance and maintain relative distance from the subject and it comes out great.  Beach videos clear with good sound capture.  Videos of us snorkeling in deep water off Lanai and in Pupukea on Oahu were fantastic for the small lens of this camera.Cons:Need to add a wrist flotation device.  I found a good bright orange one that works.  Caution read the reviews; there are similar looking ones that aren't buoyant enough to hold it up.  I found this one on E-bay from an Australian merchant.Also the wrist strap got in the way when we went kayaking.  It keeps hitting the side of the kayak.  I was worried that it damage the camera or breaks off.  Need to add a neck strap as well.  This kind of camera needs quick and easy access to take pictures and not worry about environment around it.  Too hard to keep in pocket when kayaking.In bright light the display screen is nearly useless.  I had an old Minolta 35 mm underwater camera years ago.  It was bright yellow floated and had a strap on aiming target.  Would like to see some thing similar to help line up the camera to what you are photographing.Would like a dedicated button to switch between underwater and surface shooting modes.  It is a menu selection, but since this is an underwater camera, it would be handy to switch back and forth directly.Side note, I am very careful about rinsing the camera clean before opening the bottom.  But on one beach (Kailua) the sand is very fine.  It sounds like some got inside the under cover slider.  I can hear a grinding sound I haven't heard before.

I don't publish my pictures in any art galleries or magazines...I just want to capture moments of myself and my family having a good time at the beach or pool.With that said, I have used this thing twice at the pool, and it takes GREAT pictures...given the fact that it was submerged underwater most of the time.  There aren't any \"o-rings\", but I am sure replacing the foam gasket at the SINGLE opening (that allows for battery, PC connection, and computer upload) after frequent use, will ensure peace-of-mind when you walk to the beach or enter the water.  There is no sliding door to protect the lens, but that is a good thing.  I would hate to have a lens protector slide up and down every time I turned it on...if it had a piece of sand trapped in it.  Buy a case to protect the lens and LCD screen when you aren't using it!If you want a camera that is for fun, save your time and money and get it while it's still available.

Wasn't sure whether to chance it again.  This camera takes fantastic video & still jpegs in the pool on a sunny day.  We brought it into the Altantic Ocean on the north-east coast, where the water is greenish-- darker than I've seen it in Florida.  The camera was not able to get images through the ocean.  However, because it's so water-resistant, we were able to get great shots of surfing & playing in the ocean, without worrying about the water damaging the camera.  The clarity is great, and the shutter speed is so fast that it really catches a spray or splash of water-- really cool as you see all the droplets fanned out, sparkling in the sun.Where this camera falls short is when lighting is low.  The flash is poor and when it is not bright and sunny the picture becomes grainy.  However, for catching water fun on camera, it was amazing.  If it is your only camera, you may find it frustrating with indoor and low light photography, but for a great, fun way to capture fun in the sun & water, it was fantastic.Another feature that we like is the rechargeable battery.  It does seem to run out of charge fairly quickly-- after 2 days of taking pictures & videos & reviewing them frequently, we needed to recharge.

One piece of advise, purchase cameras well in advance of actually needing them in order to get acquainted with the functions.The shutter speed is too slow.  We lost many good shots underwater because of the shutter speed (1.5 to 2 seconds).. This may not seem like a long time, but for underwater shots, fish can swim 20' away in a couple of seconds or disappear all together.  Above water, pictures turned out fine.We did get some good underwater video in Cozumel.  The sun was shinning at that point and provided ampel lighting under water.  You cannot zoom while in video mode.  Nor does it have a light/flash that can be used like regular video cameras.  The videos are very clear.A second word of advise, buy a second battery.  I took about 60 pictures and 10 (30 second) videos on day one by the time the battery died.  Luckily, I took someone elses advise on this site and bought (even remembered to charge it too) another battery.Overall, we like this camera for its size, quality and value for the price ($139).

I decided to take a chance because of the cost and I am glad I did. I figure most people are more likely to write a review if they have bad luck with an item so that's most likely the reason you see mostly bad. When literally tens of thousands or more of a product are sold their is always some bad apples, but mine is great. The design is easy to grip, and it will fit in your back pocket. I have taken around 400 pictures with mine so far, most being underwater around 4 to 8 feet and I was pleased with the clarity of the prints, especially ones taken in a pool. I have had it submersed with the floating Lanyard and forgot about it for hours. No problem. I have also taken indoor shots and they as well look as good as any point and shoot Cameras I have owned that have cost more. The only drawback I can think of is the fact that you have to remove the battery to charge it, but I realized it would be next to impossible to have a waterproof charging port on it so it is just a must. The key to making sure you never have a leak problem I figure must be to make sure before you close the battery door, that the gasket is not dirty, sandy or otherwise not clean since most gaskets would leak if a consistent pressure wasn't applied all around. Also make sure that it clicks, indicating it is securely closed. The only thing I would suggest is the optional High Capacity Battery to take along if doing a lot of video since it uses a 120v. wall charger. All in all, it is a very good Camera regardless of it's low price and I would suggest it to anyone wanting an inexpensive Point & Shoot Camera even if they didn't intend to take it underwater just for it's water resistance alone.", "Date": "February 5, 2010"}, {"Title": "Me gusta", "Author": "J.

Also, with some minimal photoshop editing any lighting/color issues can be fixed easily.As others mentioned the stiff picture button makes it is hard to tell if the picture was taken underwater sometimes. It was not a big deal and it was portable enough to bring everywhere.I bought this Pentax floating wrist strap and it was much smaller and easier to use than the one meant for this camera.

The pictures come out blurry or not as crisp as you would expect from a good megapixel camera.  The lag time it takes to get a photo is infuriating.  You have to press the shutter and hold the camera still for about 2 seconds before the shot is captured.  This is not a good camera for live action shots, like moving kids and pets or sports.The buttons are simplistic and easy to figure out.  I enjoy the fact that the camera is waterproof and rugged.  I am going to give it to my husband for his fishing adventures.  But I am going to buy a Samsung Dualview TL225 next, it seems much more fun and creates better photos than this camera.

A few weeks ago we sent the camera back with a note apologizing for being so late in returning it, and in less than 1 week we received in the mail a full refund credit at Amazon. Thanks!Now what do folks think of the new Pentax WS80?

I bought this camera to replace my Olympus Stylus 770 which recently died (the waterproof camera suffered water damage...go figure). So I try to put my SDHC memory card in and it won't work. So I use the internal memory to take a few pictures of non-moving objects (the sleeping cat, kitchen table, bed)...just 'stuff' to try out the camera. The shutter speed is SLOW. Like the slowest camera I've ever seen. Every single photo I snapped was blurry beyond recognition. I immediately returned this product. I was really dissapointed because the price was good but I guess you get what you pay for.Luckily I had some gift cards come my way and I have a Canon D10 on order.

The flash made almost everything washed out, but if I turned the flash off, the images would ALWAYS be blurry - even on the no blur mode - and a bit green-tinted.This is probably one of the most inexpensive waterproof cameras, but with the amount of wasted shots it takes, it's really worth a few extra dollars to get a camera that produces pictures worth looking at.", "Date": "January 4, 2010"}, {"Title": "Best camera ever!", "Author": "Brett A.
