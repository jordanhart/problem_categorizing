{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Much better than anticipated.  Pre-sale reviews are overly critical", "Author": "Andrew J. Marton", "ReviewID": "R3BSBOVW1XGV0S", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I was looking for a new digital camera to replace my Leica V-Lux 1 which a bought a couple of years ago.  I sold the Leica and was planning to use the money to buy a current camera.  My dilemma was whether to stay with a super zoom camera (flaws and all) or take a step toward an entry model DSLR.  I also wanted a 2009 model as I wanted the most current technology available so I would be less inclined to feel the need to buy an \"upgrade\" in another year or so.  Ultimately, I narrowed my search down to the Sony HX1, Canon SX1, Panasonic G1 and Sony a300.  For me, build quality and feel, size (travel convenience) and lens versatility were my main priorities (not necessarily in that order).  I think it is very important to figure out exactly what you really want out of your camera so you get a good fit that matches your expectations.  So for me, low light picture quality was not a major concern as I expected to use the camera mostly outdoors or in good lighting situations.  And in-door shots were probably going to be portraits or museum shots so again it was not a big concern for me.Initially, I really liked the form factor of the SX10 (SX1 was not out yet) and its feel in my hands and layout.  But I did want a reusable intelligent battery vs.  AAs and I was not that impressed with the screen resolution and EVF.  Reviews of the SX1 were also a little disappointing so I decided to pass on the Canon.  I next explored the DSLRs.  I really liked the Sony a300 but in the end couldn't justify the cost (this is a minor hobby for me and kids are teenagers so there are a lot less Kodak moments for m) and I didn't want to lug lenses around as I did that most of my life when I had old fashioned film cameras like the Nikon FE2 / N6006.  The G1 was very intriguing but I was leaving on a summer vacation in early June and did not want to wait too long as I wanted to be completely familiar with the camera before the trip and know how to \"work\" the camera so I got good results (experience has taught me that there is a learning curve on getting descent pictures from a particular model) so I passed on the G1 as its release date was in June.  In the end, I  \"talked\" myself out of buying a DSLR system for one main reason - I simply was not ready or committed to traveling around with all the lenses I would want  - wide angle and zoom.  Basically I went with convenience / ease of use over picture perfection.  For ME the step up in picture quality was not worth the trouble of walking around with all that gear.  I do a fair amount of camping and scenic trips so I like to keep my load light.  HD video was not an issue at all as I have the Canon HV30 which is simply an amazing camcorder.  It also takes incredible video in low light situations.  I highly recommend it.In the end, I decided on the HX1 because of the features that I thought were cool and would inspire creativity on my part.  For me, convenience is a big factor.  At some point, my enthusiasm drops off in direct relationship to whether or not it is a PIA to do something.  This is a character flaw for me but worth considering if you have similar tendencies over time.  Interestingly, this also happens to be my first Sony camera although I have had several Sony camcorders in the past - so I don't believe that brand loyalty or familiarity with Sony played a part in my decision (aside from my confidence that Sony products made in Japan are exceptionally well made).  The panoramic picture, twilight  and anti-blur features and burst picture mode (10 frames) ultimately swayed.  I thought that all of these features, despite some valid weaknesses added value to the camera and would enhance my digital camera experience.  I also really liked the build quality, menu structure and ergonomics.  As for the features, the panoramic picture feature works well once you understand how to use it and recognize its limitations.  So far I have been very happy with the results.  I am working on sharpening the picture as I think it is a little soft for my tastes.  But it is so easy to use and I use it often just for fun!  I find myself exploring options - something I would not do before and certainly not during post production when I am trying to tweak the 100s of pictures that I have taken during some adventure.  Same for the twilight and anti-blur features.  I find myself trying out each feature and comparing the results.  Again, I am very happy with the results.  Is it exceptional - no, but pictures turn out better than if you did not have the option and I am not overly critical as it looks great on the screen or 4x6 print out.  Even 8x10 is respectable.  Quite frankly, it's really nice not to have to do all that editing in \"post production\".  (I use Adobe CS.)  I think the lens quality is exceptional and like the way the camera lens extends out when you power up the camera - as it pushes off the lens cap.  A small cute feature that everyone seems to have overlooked in their reviews.  But quite easy to get used to - like all the little auto on features in your car (and the lens has a strap so it safely hangs by the side of the camera).  I am not sure if that is an intended result but I love it.I wish the initial start up was a tad faster but it's not slow - I just wish it was faster.  Zooming in and out is average.  Nothing to write home about but not necessarily slow.  My recollection is that the Panasonic Z26 I had at one time was faster.  I also wish the lens was slightly wider than 28mm but it will have to do.  (I am spoiled on this point as my son has a Nikon 10.5mm lens on his Nikon D2H and it is amazing when taking close ups of flowers, etc.  - I love the distortion).  But on the flip side the zoom is amazing on the HX1 and the anti-shake feature seems to do the job.  I love the way I can pull a subject in to fill the screen!  So overall I am very happy with the lens' performance.  The EVF is small but has nice resolution.  The 3\" screen is beautiful and much better than what I saw on the SX10.  The Sony screen reminds me of HD TV - it is that smooth and the colors are fantastic.  It appears to have a very good anti-reflective coating. Hopefully it will last.  I wish it had a swivel mount like the canon so I could turn in the screen to protect it when it is put away but the articulating stem is better than nothing.Menu navigation is relatively easy for me with the HX1 and I prefer it to the Canon menu for some reason - even though I have HV30 camcorder.  I think Sony started from scratch on this menu or adopted the basic scheme from the a300/a350 series and it makes sense and is intuitive.  I like it better than the menu tree on my past Nikons, Canons and Panasonics.All in all, I am extremely happy with the HX1 (only had it for a week so far) and strongly recommend that you check out the camera in person as I read every (and I mean every) pre-sale review on it and found that a lot of the criticisms were overly hyper-technical or ultimately less significant during my test of the camera.", "Date": "May 5, 2009"}, {"Title": "BEST COMBINATION OF POSSIBILITIES", "Author": "Joseph C.", "ReviewID": "R2NEO1Z1VXSX5R", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Before to order Sony HX1 through Amazon, I did a lot of reserch works with all possible information online, my considerations were among Canon SX1,Canon T1i, Nikon P90 and Sony HX1.Now after almost two weeks of practice with Sony HX1,I can surely to say it's really the best combination of all cool possibilities you can find on current market:  Possibility 1: Super optical Zoom up to 34X( equv. to 952mm)if you use 1.7x tele-conversion lens which is not offered by Canon SX1. DSLRs cannot easily reach this zoom range unless you are rich enough and strong enough to bring those lenses in your backpack.  Possibility 2: Great picture quality with the sharpness comparable to most low-end DSLRs if you have enough kownledge and technics of photograghy, for example by adjusting ISO, aperture or speed etc. HX1 offers almost all features you can find in DSLRs when you turn the mode dial to M,A,S,P. The best picture is not made by the camera, it's by your brain. Sony HX1's professional G lens made the good quality possible.  Possibility 3: Great sharp HD Video with stereo sound,you can record video as long as your memory card can hold, with a 16GB card you can easily take hours of HD video. The resolution of 1440x1080p is already sharp and smooth enough and when you watch your video with TV or computer, what you see is the same video quality as full HD at 1980x1080. Yes, Canon SX1 has the REAL 1980x1080, but it has a limitation of 4GB or 30 min, while its' video file MOV is much larger which can quickly occupy all your memory card. Canon T1i has HD video too, but it's with mono sound and same limitation.  Possibility 4: Graet performance with low light conditions.HX1's unique Hand-held Twilight and Anti-Motion Blur modes are so cool that you don't need a tripod to shoot good pictures at night, in church or any indoor occasion. They are both based on Sony's technology of combining 6 speedy shot pictures into one final photo.Besides,you have the option to change ISO up to 3200.  Possibility 5: HX1's Panorama (both horizontal or vertical)is the only fantastic feature you can find now in the whole world.  Possibility 6: Very friendly nevigation Menu lets your job simple,easy and convenient.  Possibility 7: Camera body is very solid but light weight with Sony's stylish design.  Possibility 8: High-speed shoot at 10frames/s with full resolution,so you never miss the important moments when your kids play sports. It's the highest speed which even surpasses the high-end DSLRs. Though it has a limit of 10 pics per shoot and a 17-second waiting time to saves these pics, as an ordinary amateur I'm satisfying with this feature.  Possibility 9: You can add many cool digital color filters through the built-in menu to gain the same resault of the real filters.  However, the only cons I noticed right now are the limit of 10 continuous shoots and the design of the tilt LCD.It's better to let LCD reversible(like Canon SX-1)so I can protect the screen easily. I highly recommand to apply a protective film with your LCD.  I'd like to rank SONY HX-1 with 6 or 5+ stars if it's possible. You'll not regret to own such a great combination of all possibilities at a right price range for our amateurs. The bottom line is, if you are not in the industry of publishing,advertising or media, you probably need only this camera along with your journey around the world, no matter you need high-quality,high-zoom,high-speed,HD Video,high-ISO,panorama,low-light shoot,low-light weight, HX-1 offers you all.

Over that time, I've upgraded to various Powershot models until 2 years ago, got a Sony A100 DSLR.  I love that camera and have lots of fun taking pictures with it.For work, we had been using my A100 to take product photos.  It was nice having a remote, and all of the great DSLR features that come along with that camera.  But, I have been without my A100 for a while, and was missing it dearly, so I decided to get another camera for work, and was having trouble deciding between the DSC-HX1 and the A200 DSLR.I've been playing with both, and have decided to return the A200 and keep the DSC-HX1. Here's why:1. The other people helping me take these product photos don't have any DSLR experience, and don't share my enthusiasm for photography.  They prefer point-and-shoot.  So from an ease of use standpoint, the DSC-HX1 is a better choice, especially with the live view.  The A200 doesn't have that, and although the A350 does, it does cost $100 more.2. The HX1 has enough features on it to allow us to play with settings to get a great shot.  You can control aperture, shutter speed, etc, just like on a DSLR.  Manual focusing is available, but using the selective focusing is much more accurate for our non-moving subject.  We just move the cursor to highlight the area that should be in focus, and the camera does the rest.  Otherwise, there are lots of DSLR-like features.3. The picture quality is pretty good.  The JPG only shooting mode may put off more serious photographers who want RAW, but is fine for those moving up from lesser cameras.  The large lens and CMOS4. Live histogram view is nice to make sure you get a good exposure.5. The optical zoom is great.  I turn off digital zoom, since I don't really like it.6. It's very light, much lighter than the A200 and even more so than my A100 setup.7. The panorama feature is nice, but we won't be using it at the office.8. The noise reduction modes are nice, but we won't be using it, since we have a lightbox and tripod setup for our needs.  However, at a birthday party, I could see how this would be a nice feature.There are some drawbacks that I would like to see addressed in future models:1. I wish I could manually focus with a dial.  The manual and semi-manual focusing on this thing has you move a scroll wheel to select a distance, and doesn't give the fine focusing of an actual lense dial on a DSLR.  The selective focus is a nice feature that allows us to compensate for it, but this won't work well with moving subjects, but the semi-manual mode is a decent compromise.2. There is a slight lag with the live view that I'm not used to coming from a DSLR.  However, the tilting ability of the screen helps is nice, and makes up for this minor drawback.3. With a tripod mount fitted, it's impossible to access the memory card slot.  The DSLRs had this on the side of the camera.4. Even with a tripod, it's possible to get blurry pictures when you press the shutter button.  I thought that I read a review of the camera somewhere that said it had a remote.  I didn't see mention of one in the manual, and of course there wasn't one in the box.  However, it would be a great feature.  The 2 second timer is ok, but not as convenient.*** ADDED 05-08-09 ***5. Although this camera has a great zoom lens for a non-DSLR, I found that it had difficulty focusing on close objects with a high zoom.  Taking close-ups from about 2.5 feet away, I found it difficult to go beyond 3x zoom.  Just another difference between this and a DSLR with a huge telephoto lens.  Of course, moving the product closer, and reducing the zoom did the trick.  Most people probably wouldn't be using the zoom lens this way, and probably won't have an issue with this limitation.***Overall, I would choose this camera over the A200 for many applications, but mainly for ease of use.  The quality is great, and it has lots of features.  Unless you need to change lenses or need precise manual focusing, it's hard to go wrong with this camera.  It's for someone who likes to take pictures, wants good quality photos, but doesn't want the heft nor the bulk of a DSLR.", "Date": "May 7, 2009"}, {"Title": "Fantastic Camera", "Author": "Tim Martin \"xsivone\"", "ReviewID": "R3C8MQT6IIRLHK", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This camera is fantastic.  I have had it for about almost a week and I can honestly say, it takes beautiful photos.  The zoom really gets out there, and even the smart zoom works well.  I usually do not use the digital zoom, but it works when you need it.  The burst mode is awesome when you use it.  Great for sports photos.  I shot some baseball team practice photos and it just stops the action.  The twilight mode works well and even the high ISO shots are acceptable.  The panoramic mode is cool.  While taking the photos separately and stitching them together would achieve better results, this is more convenient.  Battery life is great. I am still using it on the initial charge.  Over 300 shots and 10 short videos and there is still over 90 minutes left according to the camera.  After playing with a Panasonic DMC-FZ828 & Canon SX1 I am confident that this is the best camera for me for the money.  The image quality is on par or better than the others, the HD video is better, and there are just so many more features on the Sony that make it a winner.", "Date": "April 28, 2009"}, {"Title": "Awesome camera!", "Author": "kuangw01", "ReviewID": "RN27GT08NCT7B", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I just took this camera on a 2 week trip to Brazil and Argentina and I absolutely love it! I have owned 5 Sony cameras and this is the best that I've seen. Prior to this, I've had 4 point-and-and-shoot cameras from the cybershot series as well as the DSLR A100. I travel extensively, so I mostly use the camera for scenic shots. I've had the A100 for about 3 years now. While I am happy with the image quality, it does weigh quite a bit especially if you have to carry 2 lenses with it. Also, my fiance loves to take videos, so he's been using the T10 as a backup camera and camcorder. I was looking for a lighter camera that also has good video capabilities, and viola! I found the HX1! I struggled between giving 4 or 5 stars on this review, and at the end decided on 5 stars. Here's why:You must know what type of camera you need before making a purchase. For me, the HX 1 has the perfect package. It has 20x optical zoom (which also works in video mode), perfect for spotting small animals in the Amazon jungle. The innovative hand-held twilight and anti-motion blur modes take 6 burst shots and even out to give a clearer picture. I've tried all these modes with maximum zoom and the image qualities were excellent. Even with super-steady-shot in place, I could not achieve the same clarity with my A100 in low light conditions or with motion. I took pictures of monkeys in motion, landscape shots on a wobbly canoe, zoomed into flowers across the river...and the HX1 always delivered. The panoramic mode was really awesome. I took fantastic panormas of Rio de Janeiro and Iguazu Falls, vertically and horizontally. While the resolution is not high and there are glitches if you look closely, I cannot complain because I would not have taken any of those shots if I had to stitch together the panormic image myself. The 10fps burst mode is really cool. It's true that you have to wait for it to process, but who cares if you can catch something in live action. The HD videos came out very very clear, even on my HDTV. I bought an 8gb memory stick and almost filled up the whole card because it was so much fun to play with all the features of the camera. And the weight really mattered. This camera was so much lighter than what I expected given it's slew of functions, that I took it everywhere, even on long hikes. Many of the photos that I took would not have existed if I had to lug the SLR because it was just too bulky and heavy.That being said, this camera does have its shortcomings. It is a high end point-and-shoot, so do not expect it to deliver SLR quality shots. For that, you need a real SLR. All the reviews that said it performs poorly in high ISO setting are true, and the noise is definitely noticeable beyond 800 or so. But again for me, I take mostly daytime outdoor shots, so it didn't really matter. In the intelligent mode and program modes, you can only choose \"no macro\" or \"automatic macro\". This is kind of annoying when you really need a macro shot of a flower or insect, because the camera sometimes doesn't know what to focus on (it will automatically focus on the object closest to it, which may not be the desired subject). You can choose manual focus, but it's a bit of a hassle to keep changing settings, as you cannot really move the lens back and forth like a real SLR lens. Thus, you will have to choose the distance for the camera to focus on, which may seem too long when the butterfly is about to fly away... =)I give this camera 5 stars because it's perfect for my needs - namely the 20x zoom, the smaller size compared to DSLRs, the HD video capability (a good HD camcorder will cost upwards of $600), strong battery life (takes up to 380 shots on one charge) and the innovative functions. such as panoramic mode, hand held twilight, and anti-motion blur modes. It does have enough manual functions such as shutter priority or aperature priority modes and manual focus should you choose to use them. All in all, it fits all my needs and I had loads of fun with it.", "Date": "May 12, 2009"}, {"Title": "The perfect stop gap camera - Two weeks use report", "Author": "Wat", "ReviewID": "R3VLRX9IGCDSIX", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I was somewhat scarred as a youth having to carry around a huge film SLR. Looking back now I appreciate the film quality, but it made me a point and click user for most of my adult life. Now that I have a child, I really wanted to get back to the best possible picture quality and also capture HD movies.The HX1 is exactly the camera I need and can afford right now. The photo quality is the best I've experienced in years and the HD video is top notch. My previous cameras, the Sony T500 and W290 had very good 720p HD video. The HX1 1080p HD video is noticeably better.  After two weeks and weekends of use, here are my pros and cons:Pros- Great photo quality- Full size HDMI cable support. It comes with an adapter so you can use any HDMI cable which is much cheaper than buying a Mini HDMI cable- Camera feels very solid- Panorama mode is fun, especially if you print it out- HD video is fantastic. Stereo sound is great- Great feel in your hands, comfortable grip- LCD is nice and big. Swivel screen feature gets used a lot- Automatic mode gets the perfect shot most of the time- I love that there are different levels of shooting modes including full manual. I feel this is the perfect trainer before moving to a full SLR- Camera is very lightCons- Camera turns on and off fairly quickly, but not instant (fast enough that I haven't missed any photo ops though)- I wish the LCD swiveled to protect the screen. I highly recommend a screen protector as the LCD rubs against your chest when using the neck strap- Low light performance is better than point and clicks, but it's no SLRI feel the HX1 is the perfect camera for those seeking great photos, sharp HD video, and a high zoom for a price more affordable than a full SLR with HD video and high zoom lens.

Like the burst mode which captures up to 10 pics and u can choose the best out of it.  Similarly the smile detection mode which really does a good job of clicking at the right moment.  The flash in completely dark ambiance comes really good as if the place had good lighting.  Sweep Panorama is simply great, so easy and most of the time even if we shake the picture still comes good.  The HD video is simply awesome both the quality of the video and audio.The bad part (yes its bad, to me its highly disappointing) is the quality of the picture is really not meeting the basic expectation.  The pictures are most of the time noisy irrespective of good lighting or not.  In Intelligent Auto mode, you have to either choose burst or smile detection mode.  The un-comfortable part is in burst mode the flash can't be switched on and in the smile detection mode flash can be switched on but the camera starts clicking automatically even before every one in the picture is ready and we are ready to take the picture (like before we adjust the area of the picture).  So we are forced to go for the Manual / Program mode which is not a great answer for a point-and-shoot camera.On a whole the camera has real great features, but the noisy image quality  makes it average or below average camera.

Simply stated, this camera is ideal for anyone wanting a technologically superior, intermediate/advanced, point and click digital camera, without the knowledge required or hassle of a DSLR. The panorama feature worked flawlessly right out of the box, just be careful not to have fast moving objects in the frame. The gorgeous, articulating LCD is a godsend. Expected a little better still picture quality from the CMOS sensor but is overall satisfactory, color reproduction is very accurate. 1080p video quality is superb. In camera editing features are great. 20x optical zoom is outstanding. I can achieve very sharp, high contrast photos using basic editing software such as Picasa. Video and stereo sound is top quality. I bought this camera after retiring my DSC-H1 (the original ultra-zoom, 12x). The H1 was the workhorse of my camera collection and I relied upon it to get the job done, quickly and conveniently. The upgrades from the H1 to the HX1 are immeasurable. I especially love the G lens, the speed (10fps burst) and the fact that you can zoom video. It's as if they took every issue I had with the H1 (which were few) and fixed, upgraded, and or added it to the HX1 and then some. My only con is the fact that it doesn't seem able to fit aftermarket lens filters. I am hoping to rely on this new version for many years to come. Great camera!I agree with the above reviewer who talked about the lens popping off on power up, brilliant!!!

Stevens \"Housephile\"", "ReviewID": "R1FY6EHTPE4Q2H", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Like many of you, I spent a significant amount of time researching cameras before coming up with a decision that was best for me.  My first digital camera was a Sony (back in 2001) and I quickly returned it for a Canon due to the ridiculously poor picture quality and expense of the memory sticks.  Canon has never done me wrong, I have to say, so I was a little hesitant to venture \"across the aisle\" to the Sony HX-1.  Let me just say: Sony has definitely stepped up their game... and then some.  Before I begin, here is some background of my search before I spoil the ending (although I think I already did):1. I landed on the super zoom category given my NEED for more zoom (3-5 X zoom is no longer acceptable) and my self-admitted laziness in terms of the D-SLR family... not wanting the extra weight and not yet smart enough for the full manual world.2. From all of the reviews, I was most intrigued by three different cameras:  Sony HX-1, Canon SX20 IS, and the Panasonic Lumix dmc fz35.3. All of them, of course, have very strong features that make them quite appealing.  To the same effect, all of them (even more \"of course\") seemed to be lacking in certain areas.  - Canon:  Very useful articulating LCD, but only 2.5 inches (and TRUST me, it makes a difference).  HD video, but not full HD (720p vs 1080p).  Canon name, but no new innovation to speak of.  - Panasonic: Larger LCD, but fixed to the camera body.  No HD video, but strong reviews on picture quality.  18 X zoom vs Canon & Sony's 20 X.  - Sony:  Won me over for the following:  Larger LCD that pulls out and rotates up/down (yeah, not articulating like the Canon). Innovation (i.e., setting an example for other companies to follow) in terms of processing chip (cmos) that allows for Sweep Panorama (FUN), Burst (up to 10 fps... although not usually that many), and anti-blur modes for both low light (twilight) and normal motion.  The video is, in effect, full HD (1080p), the buttons feel VERY intuitive, and the overall feel of the camera is solid and easy to hold in most sizes of hands.I've had the camera for several days, and during that time I can say I've been extremely impressed with the pictures this camera helps create (remember, YOU are the one who is responsible for deciding what to shoot and what settings to use).  I can tell that I will have this camera for several years and will get significant use out of it.  That being said, it is not perfect.  While I have yet to have a camera that impresses me with indoor shots, this camera has something to be desired when looking at indoor pictures I took on my desktop.  Not bad at all, just not what I would want ideally.  I think it loses touch with color and clarity when taken indoors, although the flash helps with both... it loses the character that you get from non-flash pics.All in all, I really came to my decision after reading so many USER reviews stating how much they enjoyed the camera as well as the cutting edge direction Sony has taken its product development.  And now that I have it, the macro is incredible, the zoom allows me to take crystal clear pictures of the MOON, the colors when outdoors are vivid and true to life, and the overall \"like\" factor is very strong.  I stand by this camera, and recommend it for anyone who, like me, has been craving more zoom power and ingenuity.  In the end, remember... the camera can only do so much. It's up to you to learn the features and be the photographer.  Best of luck!", "Date": "November 29, 2009"}, {"Title": "Fantastic Camera!", "Author": "William G.

I made this video with the Sony DSC-HX1 and was delighted with the results.  I started experimenting with still shots and found that quite easy to understand.  I wanted to try the video feature, so I made this video of myself playing the piano in my home.  When I played it back I could hardly believe the results...the video quality is simply outstanding.  I am extremely pleased with this camera and plan on trying many of the other features because it has a lot to offer.  Anyone who buys this camera should be very happy with it.", "Date": "November 2, 2009"}, {"Title": "This camera rocks!!", "Author": "Debbie Scott \"Only looking for things that ma...", "ReviewID": "R1GK0JWQFL1U84", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I was looking for a camera as an upgrade from my Canon S3 IS. I did quite a bit of research (read lots of review and looked at photos from the reviewers/users). This camera wasn't even on my radar until I read a review/top 5 list on [...]. After reading their review, I came to amazon's customer reviews and read them all, then looked at all the customer photos. Afterwards I went to my local Best Buy to get a hands-on \"feel\". The camera felt sturdy in my hands and the grip was deep enough for my long fingers. I then tested out the zoom and macro - 2 features I use extensively...I was pleased with both.3 days after I got the camera I used it for a 3-day camping trip. I was impressed with the zoom and macro capabilities. There were only a few occasions when I couldn't get the lens to focus on a subject: once was a flower that was blowing in the breeze (have the same problem with the S3 IS) another time, while staying on the trail, the zoom was too much to focus where I wanted and the brush kept me from being able to go over and shoot macro.With that being said, the 10-shots per second is fun to use, but those 10-20 sec. (when writing to the disc) does feel like an eternity...especially when you want to keep shooting a wildlife subject. Indoor shots (outside of automatic setting) take forever, though I did get a really cool low light photo of the inside of our RV with just the rope lights on (had my elbows resting on the table).Putting the camera in Intelligent Auto Adjustment mode helps. I was standing in the kitchen at home and pointed the camera down a dark hallway and got a phenomenal shot, I also used that setting in my niece's hospital room as it always looks like twilight time in there (my brother-in-law was impressed with the photos I was able to take).As for battery life, I always use the viewfinder (except for some macro shots) so that does help give more time. I love seeing how much time is left on the battery - I tried it with the LCD first, made a mental note of remaining time, then switched to viewfinder and gained about 10 min.If you're looking for a new digital camera, do your homework online and get a list together, then I highly recommend going to a store and trying out the different cameras you're looking at first. Check out how the camera feels in your hand, try out the zoom/macro modes and take some test shots. Then you can go back online and order your camera (if you can wait that long :)).** 9/29/09 Update to battery info - I charged up the battery last night and put back in camera this morning. Turned it on (LCD view) battery showed 228 min. In less than 1 minute it showed 227 minutes...I switched to viewfinder and it showed I had 301 minutes left.", "Date": "September 22, 2009"}, {"Title": "Strikes the right balance", "Author": "Neil E. Fox \"Gadget Phreak\"", "ReviewID": "R3UAROPEAXP3V4", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I struggled over a 4 or 5 star rating for this product but ultimately believe that Sony has delivered an excellent package in the HX1. The other cameras I considered prior to purchasing the HX1 were several DSLRs, which I ruled out due to lack of support for video and the Canon SX1. The tipping points for me on the Sony were the panorama, twilight steady shot and high speed burst modes.The image quality is absolutely excellent and there are more than enough program modes to help you get the ideal image for your shooting conditions. The intelligent mode selection works surprisingly well  and is our defacto setting for the camera. I must say that while the panorama setting initially felt like gimmick, it is REALLY cool and works very well. I now look for opportunities to shoot panoramas! There a many more than you think - this feature will change your perspective on shooting images.The video is high quality, though I've been wrapped up in the still image shots since getting the camera a few days ago so I can't comment fully on this yet.There are only two significant issues that keep this from being the perfect camera for me. The first is the damn Memory Stick format. What the heck is Sony thinking with this? I realize that corporate greed and ego drive Sony to create  their own standards for every thing but this has nearly prevented me from purchasing this excellent product. I have purchased a 4 GB MS Duo Pro and a 8 GB Micro SD with a MS Duo adapter. I have not used the Micro SD with the adapter yet but I'm concerned about speed. We shall see.The other frustration for me is the speed of writing the 10 shots taken in burst mode to the memory card. It takes 10-15 seconds to write the 10 shots to the card. That seems oddly high to me but I'm sure that they tried to make it as fast as possible.Overall, the camera is fairly small and light for a \"near SLR\" experience. I recommend this camera to those who want the super zoom, HD video and image control offered herein.", "Date": "May 1, 2009"}, {"Title": "Best balance between picture and video", "Author": "Ashish Jain", "ReviewID": "R22BSCJZX5R420", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This camera provides the best combination - Decent picture quality, Excellent HD video and 20x optical zoom. Build quality is great and battery life is good.I agree that picture quality will not match with DSLR but you need to spend a lot of money to buy a DSLR and telephoto IS lens to match the optical zoom of this camera. (if you are a family with very young kids, consider purchasing a DSLR for home photography and special moments + a smaller pocket camera for small outings).This camera is very good to learn manual controls. I manage to get very nice pictures in Manual mode. Automatic mode is good for most situations but there are a few shots that can be composed better with manual.The controls for manual settings are one of the best with a jog dial on the back of camera.Screen: The articulating LCD screen is superb and provides easy angle for taking pictures and videos.HD video is fun to watch on a big screen TV although it might not be as good as higher end Camcorders but its pretty close in bright to normal light conditions.I once shot a picture of a giant lizard on 20x optical zoom in a jungle, image stabilization work wonders.. i hardly used my tripod since i purchased this camera.Cons: Low light performance is not-so-good without flash. I end up with pictures that are either on softer side or have considerable noise. I correct such pictures to some extent using software. Another thing is that Sony could have put a bigger sensor in such a premium camera, i spent over 550$ on camera + case + Card.Update: 14-April-2012: I recently purchased a camcorder and DSLR with 3 lens since my needs have changed after having a baby. I am enjoying every moment with my new gadgets since i am better equipped with a faster lens and bigger sensor to capture those special indoor shots of my baby without flash but still would say that Sony HX1... ROCKS...Update 19-Dec-2012: This is probably my last update on this camera. It has been more than 6 months since i sold my Sony HX1. So, i will share my experience after selling it.I started using Canon T1i DSLR with multiple lenses and now upgraded to T4i. Once you start using DSLR, you can not go back to P&S; again easily. I am happy to sacrifice wonderful telephoto zoom of HX1 for better indoor/low light capability of DSLR.I do miss the 560mm zoom at times but i do most of photography at home with my toddler who is always on the move for which a DSLR with good len or a speedlite is must.I also possessed Canon Vixia HF100 camcorder (sold recently) and currently do my videos on Canon S95 P&S.; Both of these shoot better video than Sony HX1 specially in low light conditions.Before you invest your money into any mega zoom P&S;, do analyze your needs carefully. I sold my 2 year used HX1 for under 200 which cost me over 550$ with some accessories at time of purchase. I can bet on the fact that no mega-zoom P&S; will give you DSLR like quality even when lot of people rave about it and it gets rated highly.I loved my Sony HX1 but i had to let it go finally in favor of DSLR and a large sensor P&S.;Edit: 11-Feb-2013: It has been nearly 9-10 months since i sold this camera but i still miss it. I purchased Panasonic LX7 recently and found this newer camera is horrible while using in-built flash which HX1 was so good at.", "Date": "September 14, 2010"}, {"Title": "A \"dad's\" review: the perfect camera for both still & video. Updated Review.", "Author": "KindlePad", "ReviewID": "R1XA5R13KG3EUG", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Updated 06/2010:I have this camera for right at a year now & it is still the best camera I have ever owned. I was actually looking to see if Sony had updated this camera or made a new one but in it's class - it seems to still be rocking the house. Look at the reviews!The still quality is fantastic using either automatic or the programmable mode it just takes perfect pictures. I have been learning to use some of the other settings and how to take better pictures in bright sunlight or low light. The variety of scene modes is fantastic. The handheld twilight mode is a blast! If you want to shoot an outdoors twilight scene handheld, this mode will take several rapid fire shots without using the flash and then combines / average them together instantly to give you a stunningly clear shot! Wow!The panorama mode is great but I have to remember to use it. It's super easy and you take the shot right on the camera, no software needed to process afterwards. You just put it in Pan mode and then follow the guides on the LCD for moving the camera left to right. You need to keep it level but it warns you if your movements are off.Probably the best thing about this camera is still it's ability to shoot HD 1080 res stabilized video (mp4 format) along with the perfect stills. That means you really don't need to carry two cameras any more. You can finally use 1 camera for your family vacations, parties, events etc.  Plus you get to use the 20x optical zoom & stabilization for the video! Holy cow right? Plus you can easily switch between still and video to capture both easily.The adjustable LCD screen is also more handy than it sounds. You can pop the LCD off the back of the camera and pull it out and tilt it up and down. This lets you get shots or video you normally would not. Just this weekend I was shooting some video of a graduation and the people in front of me were standing up. I stuck the camera up as high as I could, swiveled the big 3in LCD down towards me and I was able to shoot great video. Works the same for shooting from a lower angle also.I am sure there are better, more expensive cameras out there. I am not a pro photog - but I do want stunning quality pics and video & the ability shoot under a lot of different conditions. This camera gives me both in a simple, easy to use rig. Also, it has an \"easy\" shooting mode so I can hand it to someone to use.-----I am not a pro photog but my iphoto library is over 18,000 images of family & travel pics. So, when it comes to digital photography, I have been there since day 1. I have friends who buy the $2500 digital camera, thats not for me. I want a camera in the sub $500 range as I know I will be buying a newer one in a few years.What impressed me about this camera frankly is the HD video capabilities. Speaking to the Dad's out there, you know the drill. You go on vacation or some event and you want to shoot stills and video. So that means you lug both the still camera & the video camera. You are constantly swapping cameras to get both stills & video and that means you're also lugging around both power adapters or batteries & related media. You cease to become part of the vacation and become the \"official photographer.\" You end up behind the camera and not in front of it.Enter the Sony Cybershot DSC-HX1 9MP, this baby shoots exceptional still photos and also HD video on the same media card (so get a big one). If you set the video to Fine quality, you get gorgeous wonderful HD video you can edit or burn to DVD. And now you have cut your gear in half. I think the camera is applying image stabilization to the video but you still need to hold it pretty steady. It also sports a stereo to capture amazing audio quality.The camera features are stunning also, the panorama mode is endless fun, the twilight setting is luscious and the \"easy mode\" is great for when you must reluctantly hand the camera over to someone else to shoot pics. There are plenty of detailed reviews for this camera and all give it a very good score.Will this rival a dedicated camcorder? Not in features but the image quality is great. If you want gorgeous stills and also the ability to capture a modicum of HD video, this is the camera for you. I took it to the beach last week and it was great to finally carry just 1 camera.Small note, for the last few models (and this one) Sony has been using this miracle of a battery charger. No longer do you get this huge awkward battery charger & cable nightmare - you get this tiny, \"deck of card\" sized charger that you put the battery into and plug right into a wall socket. I can't tell you how great this for travel. Former sony cameras came with this enormous charger and cable that was twice the weight of the camera itself.", "Date": "June 25, 2009"}, {"Title": "Excellent camera!", "Author": "Christopher Lee", "ReviewID": "RW97UEI58RT2G", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I bought the DSC-HX1 as a companion to my DSLR, and it's a brilliant camera.  The image quality in low light is great for a non-DSLR, and in good lighting conditions, the images require close examination to tell the difference.The video from the camera is amazing - my pictures of a hummingbird are very lifelike.  The color reproduction is superb - the shimmering green of the bird against the bright red of the feeder is every bit as vivid as life, without being oversaturated.  There is a simple little adapter which allows you to plug into a HDMI cable for viewing your pictures and video - very quick and easy.The low-light functions are like nothing I've ever seen in a consumer camera - using the speed of the imager to take multiple images and integrate them and reduce noise or blur.  It's a technique commonly used in astronomy for imaging stars, but brought into practical everyday use.  It works quite well in normal indoor lighting - allows you to take pictures without flash - and the associated shadows.  It saves the gyrations of bouncing the flash, which is nice when you're just trying to capture the moment without drawing attention to yourself.  It's also great when the venue prohibits flash photography.The articulating LCD screen is great for the low-angle and over-the-head shots.

And now that its down to around $400, I say run, don't walk, and put this puppy in your hands.I've been using digital cameras for several years now and my biggest gripe was the lag between hitting the shutter button and when the shutter actually fires. I can't tell you how many priceless moments were lost because of that delay. Well, forget that delay forever. This camera is damn fast and will even bracket 3 exposures in the time it took me to get one on my old point and shoot. The steady shot works amazingly well and as someone else mentioned, you can take blur free shots in low light without a tripod. I took some night time shots of the moon rising over the Cancun beach that are just amazing for a non dslr.In years past, I trecked across Europe lugging my trusty Fujica with 3 lenses (one, a 200mm zoom) and constantly hating the weight and inconvienence. Not to mention the constant lense changing from wide to tele and the knowledge that I probably had the wrong lens for the shot 'cause I had no time to change lenses. Of course, the solution to this problem is to carry a second camera...and you know where this story is going. The 20x OPTICAL zoom on this baby covered all my bases except extreme wide angle...and this was solved by the panorama feature. One camera...one lens...ahhhh the freedom.The final killer feature is the HD video mode. From the back of the theater, at night, I could show the whole stage and zoom in on the stage performers faces. My audience was blown away with the clarity and zoom range. And the steady shot feature made the extreme zoom moments rock steady. The picture did not jump all over the place and looked extrordinarily professional. The only down side (if this can be considered a down side) is that the HD video can only be copied on to a bluray disk and for this you need a bluray writer, which I don't have. I was quite disappointed when I couldn't distribute the disk to my friends.", "Date": "August 24, 2009"}, {"Title": "Great strengths but overwhelming weakness", "Author": "D.

The macro ability was also quite good.The panoramic shots that instantly process on the camera were great and I almost kept the camera for this ability alone.The sharpness of the shots of the wolf I took was incredible.

The over exposure was pronounced in auto mode in every situation I took pictures in.Also, when I compared the shots with my 3 year old point and shoot Sony, the older/cheaper camera's were significantly better.

I am not going to write a technical review, because those that would understand it can interpret the data for themselves. This is a simple review for a single camera that can be used by the advanced photographer and still hand it over to you wife or kids and still get a great picture. This is truly a family camera.Let me say that it never stops to amaze me how far technology has come. Having said that lets look at some of the less known feature.1- In camera editing. You can change a frown to a smile, a blur to a sharp image. Mix back and white with some color elements in the same picture and shoot with a fish eye lens effect if you want and you don't need the lens. All this and much more and it's easy to use.2- Ten pictures a second. If you have owned a digital camera, you know how slow it can be between pictures when you are trying to catch you granddaughter running about. In low light it takes multiple pictures and combines the best elements of each to give you one good image. In portrait mode it will give you a warning on the screen if the person blinks when the shutter is snapped or will take two picture when set and keep the best one.  It will wait to take the picture until someone smiles and much more. The results are stunning the technology amazing.3- Wide angle to telephoto with a small camera body and lens.4- Scene selection works like a charm. Backlight, front light, no light, portrait or landscape it sees and selects the best setting and fill flash if needed. The amature can get excellent results in the worst of conditions. Want to do it yourself, switch to manual mode.Hope this peaks your interest. I could go on for pages, but this is a great camera at a great price. I would recommend it and I have owned some of the best. This camera is fun and it allows you to focus on your subject and forget about the tech stuff.OK, some additional information. I just returned from a trip to Europe and took over 700 pictures. I have to say as a point and shoot camera, it has given me some of the best pictures  I have ever taken.LOW Light - Again, no tech speak. I found some carved statues in a dark corner of a cathedral.  It was so dark I almost walked past them if not for a flash light glimmer from a tour guide. With no flash allowed, I set the camera to low light, steady hand held mode and shot the picture. In this mode the camera shoots 5 fast pictures and the internal processor makes a composite picture from the 5 shots. The results are astounding! The pictures are rendered with natural light and are as clear and sharp as day. I used this feature over and over again with outstanding and dynamic results every time.Pan Pictures - Given the wide street pictures and tall cathedrals it is very hard to compose pictures with a standard lens and not cut off buildings and towers. The 270 degree pan mode gave me incredible pictures of street scenes and buildings that would have been lost in the translation of single images. Please not that there is some distortion as you pan across the scene in some applications, but the effect is not objectionable and in some cases added to the dynamics of the photo.In short, this is the best camera I have ever owned for this kind of work providing professional results with little or no effort.

After time, I noticed that I desired more of my photos.  My photos lacked depth of field, vibrance, resolution, and detail.  I started reading about photography and associated terms such as aperture value, shutter speed, ISO, exposure, white balance, and metering.  I quickly learned the basics of photography by visiting a few websites and determined that the camera I had wouldn't hack it for me anymore.I researched a number of cameras and landed at a review site that previewed this camera.  I compared it with some of the competition, noting that the Sony DSC-HX1 has some amazing features such as the hand-held twilight mode, anti-motion blur, sweep panorama mode, 10fps continuous shooting, and rechargeable batteries (would you believe some of the competitors use AA's).  After a lot of reading and debating, I decided on the DSC-HX1.In regards to the sweep-panorama mode: It works fantastically, both during the day and at night.The video is smooth and a high enough quality to please the eye.  This is, of course, an upgrade for me from 640 x 480 resolution video.  As I moved the camera in tight on subjects, zoom or not, I immediately noticed the Optical SteadyShot image stabalization working remarkably to make my video look steady and professional-like.  No tripod needed here.  I took the DSC-HX1 to a Killers concert where I was far enough away that I need 15-20x zoom if I wanted to get tight shots on the band members.  With proper camera holding posture (keeping it tight to my chest and using the digital viewfinder) and the SteadyShot, I was able to pull off some video that would not have been remotely possible with my limmited-zoom, no stability, HP camera.The image quality is what you would expect from a \"bridge-camera.\"  The camera's CMOS sensor capture daylight pictures with remarkable vibrance and detail appropriate to this camera's market.  Night shots at ISO 100-200 given appropriate lighting look great.  Night shots and darker indoor shots at ISO 400-800 show a degree of noise that you would expect from a sensor of this size.  I have often found myself adjusting my aperture and shutter values to allow me to use ISO 400 vice ISO 800 if at all possible.  I have not had to use ISO 1600 or 3200 manually yet - so I can't vouch for them, but I would venture to say they should only be used if it is absolutely necessary.I have not yet tested the hand-held twilight mode or anti-motion blur modes yet.  When I do, I will edit this review.Battery life is stupendous.  It is far superior to my HP camera and I far prefer taking the battery out and plugging it into the wall.  The charger for the batter is small enough to fit into the small side pocket of my camera bag.  It beats having to carry around a charger.The articulating LCD screen is bright, clear, and reveals enough detail to make a good judgment of the composition of your photo.  Only under direct bright sunlight is it difficult to see.  If this is the case, simply switch to the digital viewfinder.The viewfinder is useful in high-light situations or when keeping the camera close to your chest to maximize your steady shot.  I can't say that it is as good as the viewfinder that you'll find in a DSLR and as a result, would submit that you only use it if you need to.  The good thing is, that you can correct the focus of the image in the viewfinder via an adjustment wheel on the housing.The burst shot mode is great.  At 10, 5, or 2 FPS, you can stop motion in time and catch those special moments.  Beware though, that after you've released the shutter button of you've captured 10 pictures, the camera must pause to write these files from buffer to the memory card.  This might be a show stopper for some who are not sure when precisely that special moment will occur.  You will have to allow time for the camera to catch up with writing the images to the memory card.The camera does, of course, weight more than your typical compact, but less than a DSLR.  It's portable enough and weighs little enough that it doesn't strain the neck when worn for prolonged amounts of time.  I've worn it for 3-4 hours and felt little discomfort if any.For the price, I feel it's a great camera.  There are a lot of compact cameras that cost nearly as much and have only half the power, speed, and capability.All things considered, I think this is a great camera for someone who wants great capability without the bulk and weight of a DSLR, and is willing to work within the confines of the camera itself with few customizing accessories available.", "Date": "June 4, 2009"}, {"Title": "Wow!", "Author": "C.

Great!", "Author": "Dinesh A. Gomes", "ReviewID": "R1ABEMZNTO7AK4", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I didn't have this camera on my radar initially. I'm wary of Sony cameras after my first digital camera, a small Sony Cybershot (DSC-W70) I'd bought a few years ago suddenly stopped working about a year after I'd bought it. After that came another \"slim\" $100 - $200 price range camera which I had a for a few years. I finally decided to move up in this world and move to a \"bridge\" camera - ie. the range of cameras between the small point and shoot on one end and the full blown SLRs on the other end. I decided to try a Canon, since a friend of mine has a Canon Powershot which takes amazing pictures. The Canon SX10IS had good reviews for a camera in this range and so going by reviews (and some impatience) I went ahead and bought it online. Then while tracking the order on Amazon, i came across the Sony HX1 - it costed $60 more than the Canon, but it had everything the Canon had and more... I was intrigued by the reviews and the features like Panorama and burst (which the Canon SX10 does not have) and so I canceled the order for the Canon and went into Best Buy the next day to compare the two side by side before I settled on the Sony HX1.A humble note on buying a camera here - I think its absolutely essential to go into a Fry's or Best Buy's and pickup and play around with the display model of a camera you have your eye on (and then go online and buy it for less, hehe). For example, the screen of the Canon SX10 IS is about a half inch smaller than the screen of the Sony HX1. I didn't think that to be a big deal while reading reviews and comparing the two, but in the store when I compared the Canon SX10 and Sony HX1 side by side, that extra half inch on the screen just made a heck of a lot of difference to the whole photo taking experience. The only feature where the Canon SX10 outdoes the Sony is the MegaPixels, the Canon SX10 IS is 12.1 while this camera is 9.1. Note that even when shooting with the resolution set to 9.1 MP, the file size is about 4 - 5 Mb. Thats a heck of a lot of space on my hard drive for a photo and so mainly for this reason, I probably won't be using a Camera on a setting of more than 5 or 6 MP for most every day shooting, and therefore the extra 3 MegaPixels that the Canon offered didn't mean a great deal to me.Another observation from my experience. When choosing a camera, I think its important to keep in mind what features of a Camera are important to YOU. What would you care about most in the camera. A good zoom? Ability to shoot movies in 1080 HD? Burst mode? Are you partial to a particular brand? etc...  In this regard, I found that what I cared about in a might-purchase camera was 1) Good user reviews on pictures taken in the Auto and Scene modes 2) At least 20X zoom 3) Ability to shoot movies in 1080p HD. Once you have settled on a few parameters you care about, then the process of drilling down becomes very easy. Go to the main camera section of the site on Amazon and with the search menu on the left, you can start selecting parameters one at a time (price, zoom, brand, etc.), so as to drill down from the 1000+ cameras to three or four. For me, my drill-down search yielded the Canon SX10 and the Sony HX1 (and another Nikon and Olympus). The Sony won because for my search, in addition to having everything I wanted, and good reviews, it also had the extra features like panorama and burst that the Canon didn't have, plus screen size. I forget why I ruled out the Olympus, and the Nikon didn't make it because it didn't shoot movies.So since I've given this camera 5 stars, heres what I like most about the it.1) Great pictures*2) Extremely easy to use menu - very intuitively designed3) The zoom is quick4) Ergonomic design of the body - the placement of buttons and the \"feel\" of the camera is good5) Love the panorama and burst modes - as other reviewers have mentioned, the panorama mode works very easily and the photo comes out accurate - no mismatch or jagged stitches.*I'm still very new to this camera. I've taken about a 100 pictures so far, indoors and outdoors. The outdoor shots in good lighting are all excellent. I've yet to form an opinion on the indoor shots since I haven't taken that many yet.I will keep updating this review as I learn more about this camera. I also discovered that there's a Facebook group for this camera, to which people post their queries  etc.With this camera I hope to explore the basics of photography and move out of the Auto mode and actually start fooling around with the ISO, aperture and shutter speed settings etc. Other reviewers have mentioned that if you know how to pull those levers skillfully, you can do most of the stuff you can do with an SLR on this camera. I hope this review helps you in your search. Good Luck! I have also posted some photos I've taken with this camera.Update- March 22nd 2010: I've now owned this camera for a few months and have taken lots of pictures. Everything I said above still holds good except for one small thing I've noticed which other folks have mentioned. On the auto(intelligent) mode, a lot of the times you do get the feeling that the pictures are a little over-processed- the pictures sometime look more colorful than the reality. While some folks may like this, I feel a bit deceived. Sometimes (particularly for indoor photos taken without the flash), the background light is overcompensated. No doubt all this is in the auto mode and may also happen on other cameras, but I thought its worth a mention. All in all for the other reasons mentioned, I still like the camera and would not have chosen differently if I could go back in time to when I bought this camera. And although I mentioned this in the original review, I have to say it again. The panorama mode is AWESOME, its just offf the friggin chain...

This is a great camera option for people who want to take high quality pictures but don't want to spend a lot more money for a DSLR (with the lenses you need) OR for people who don't want to lug around the bulk/equipment of a DSLR. I really don't understand the people in these reviews complaining about poor image quality, the images I have taken with this camera have been outstanding---especially in good lighting conditions. I mostly use this camera for nature/scenery photography outdoors, and I have been very pleased with the image quality for both scenery/still objects as well as for birds and moving objects. I don't doubt that a DSLR might take better quality pictures in the eye of a professional, but in most good-lighting conditions it would be very hard to tell the difference between images from this camera and images from a low or mid end DSLR. Another thing to consider is how much you will actually get to use this camera: you can take this camera with you almost anywhere so you will most likely use it a LOT more than you would use a DSLR, which is harder to carry with you all the time. Strong points for this camera are (1) excellent overall value for the money, (2) the superzoom is very useful and the image quality even at maximum zoom is very high, (3) the panorama mode works just as well as advertised and is a very cool new feature (but if you still want to stitch your pictures together yourself you can still do that, but trust me this is one heck of a lot easier/faster and the results are excellent) and (4) much easier to carry with you lots of places (i.e., hiking, long walks, etc.) than a DLSR with the lenses you would need to cover short and long range zoom situations. As far as weak points, there is not too much to say except for a couple of minor annoyances like (1) the lens cap pops off when you turn on the camera, but this really doesn't cause any problems, (2) you have to use a Sony memory stick format (I bought the 4GB one with the camera) and (3) can't really compete with the image quality you would get from a DSLR in low light situations, but for most non-professional picture takers the images you get with this camera in low-light environments will be MORE than good enough to make you very happy with them. I have not used the video yet so I can't comment on that aspect of the camera. I highly recommend this camera, it is an excellent value!", "Date": "June 3, 2009"}, {"Title": "Excellent Hybrid Camera", "Author": "skiwildcat7 \"-Richard\"", "ReviewID": "RR0J3JU5Y57J2", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "After much deliberation, I bought this camera after trying to decide between the HX1 and the Canon SX1 and some others.  The features that brought me over were the sweep panorama, 10 shots per second burst mode, and the other reviewers who seemed to say that the image quality between the HX1 and the SX1 were not that much different.  Also, I got the HX1 for about $50 less probably (or more).  Now to just say where I am coming from, I've owned Sony DSC-H1 for the past 4 years, and that camera has been excellent and printed out great 4x6's and 8x10's.  So I was just looking for a camera that would have HD video and also take at least as good pictures as the H1.  The HX1 does the trick, let me tell you.  (That \"X\" makes all the difference!) The color is really nice, the pictures come out very well even at high zooms.Speaking of zoom, the 20x is amazing! It just keeps bringing objects closer and closer.  Comparing them to my old H1 pictures, they are definitely better.  Whether they are as good as the SX1 or other similar cameras, I cannot say.  As to people who have been comparing this camera to a DSLR, this camera is not a DSLR!  It will not take that kind of DSLR quality photo!  Go buy a DSLR if you want that. What this camera does do like a DSLR is have absolutely no shutter delay, (once it is focused) which is great for shooting sports games and such.  The burst mode works excellent and really does take 10 a second, though it does take a bit to load them onto the memory card, about 15 seconds probably which doesn't seem that long when you are actually shooting photos.The panorama mode works as advertised, and can take some extremely wide shots with the \"wide\" panorama mode.  The quality seems to be pretty good, though sometimes you can see the stitching.  At the very least, it is a lot of fun to use. The low light mode works well, though the pictures do tend to become a bit noisy, so I will not be making any poster size prints of those. The LCD screen is very large and very nice quality and I am still able to see it even in bright sunlight.  It can detach and be moved at basically an angle (up or down) relative to the camera, though it cannot be moved side to side. The menus are fairly easy to navigate and I think are pretty self explanatory, though there is a manual for explaining each mode if necessary.  I actually really like how the menus are laid out. The HD video is great quality as is the stereo sound that goes along with it (but does tend to have wind noise).  The play back on the computer was good and yes there was some image tearing but it did not seem to be nearly as bad as some sample movies I had downloaded.  I filmed a lacrosse game and it came out great.  The HD video also looks awesome connecting it directly to an HDTV, and that was with me several year old 1080i HDTV so I was not even technically seeing it at full quality.  Image tearing is barely noticeable when viewed that way.  The pictures themselves also look great when connected directly to an HDTV. Lastly, as far as I know you can't put AA's or that type of battery in the HX1 as it only takes a rechargeable battery pack, (which is good and all for the env.) so this is a problem only if you were say, heading into the mountains for a month.  If anyone knows of solutions to this I'd be glad to hear them. Lastly I recommend turning off the beeping noises.  They're slightly annoying. So summing up, here's a quick list of pros and cons:Pros:-Great upgrade over previous dsc models, especially if you haven't got one in awhile-Excellent zooming capabilities-Good color-HD video comes out well, especially on an HDTV-Large screen-Easy to navigate menus-Manual Options-The \"features\" such as panorama and low light shooting mode work well-Seemingly no or very miniscule shutter delay once focused-Burst mode=awesomeness.  Just wait to you hear the \"clickclickclickclick\"-Relatively compact for the zoom power, but def won't fit in your pocket-You'll like it if you've liked previous DSC/Sony modelsCons:-Can sometimes see slight stitching in panoramas-Memory sticks are expensive-Seems to only take a rechargeable battery pack, no AA option if neededSo yeah, I think it is a great camera-but that's just me...", "Date": "June 2, 2009"}, {"Title": "It takes a trained monkey", "Author": "Harry G.

It takes a trained monkey to attach the lens cover to the camera so it doesn't fly off into the wilderness.  First you get a thin paper clip and make it into a straight wire with a long narrow hook at one end.  Insert the hook through the tiny eyelet in the attaching cord, then pull both strands of the cord through the eyelet to make a loop.  Run the free end of the loop through the tiny little attaching point on the camera lens and pull the first loop through the loop just threaded to attach the cord to the lens.  Next, undo the strap on the left side of the camera and thread the strap through the first big loop between the buckle and the camera body.  Reattach the strap through the buckle.  Now the lens cap may jump off every time you turn the camera on, but it won't go very far because it is captured.2. I have had a lot of experience with Sony Cybershots, but the new economy has caught up with me.  This is the first one that didn't come with an undersized memory stick.  What it came with is a grossly undersized internal memory.  Buy a stick if you want to test the camera out of the box (4 GB is supposed hold 800 of the biggest pictures).Update:3. Things you aren't supposed to do with this camera:  let it get hot (plastic may warp), let it get cold (no snow below 32F), let it get wet (not splash proof), drop the battery (may explode), take it to the beach (no sand).  The list is much longer, but you get the idea. Gone are the days when you could drop a camera body into a manure spreader and shake it out and continue photographing.4.  I've made a few pictures with the DSC-HX1 on long telephoto.  This is a dull cloudy day, and the lighting is relatively flat, but the detail is nice and sharp when enlarged to 8X10 prints.  The DSLRs are potentially better, but I never could accept the responsiblity of keeping up with a 500 mm:f/5.2 lens for the DSLR.  I have an 18 mm f/3.5, but it cost as much as the DSLR body and barely equals 28MM effective, whereas the DSC-HX1 has a 28 mm:f/2.8 equivalent built into the 500 mm f/5.2 telephoto.

The images were absolutely gorgeous.It is really amazing that a camera that is packed with so many features / zoom ranges can output such high image quality.The best feature I found was the sweep panorama mode. Used it to capture bridges , tall buildings , hills , freeways. Nowhere did it disappoint.

It has many cool features that make photography fun and easy, such as the 10fps shooting mode and panorama mode. I like the flip-out LCD which lets me sneak those candid shots when no-one thinks you're taking a picture. The lens is decent and gives a sharp focus. The lithium battery lasts a long time. Unfortunately, like most cameras in this category, it does have a small imaging sensor that can give you some grainy images, especially in low light. Sony tries to compensate for this by including a low light feature that takes a number of rapid shots at different exposures in an attempt to reduce noise and give you an optimally exposed picture. Pretty cool. But you still may need to invest in some good noise reduction software. The HD video capability is a great feature and works well, you can shoot in either HD or SD and record stereo audio. I had a Canon Vixia HF100 HD video camera, and the video from this camera looks just as good when viewed on a big screen. If you want to travel light and want a decent photo camera that can also shoot high quality HD video, the Sony HX1 is a good choice.

Well now I am soooo happy, all the little things that I wished were different on the old camera are all fixed on my new one.  The video recording on my old one would not zoom so I still had to use my old camcorder for school plays and things like that, well this one zooms and how!  I was in the back row at my sons band concert and I could zoom all the way up the the Nike symbol on his shoe, it is great and now I have officially retired the camcorder (it is not a perfect camcorder replacement but I am not looking for that becasue I do not take alot of movies, if I had a wish though it would be that they made the video recording with a stabilizer but ooh well that is the only thing in my eyes that makes this camera not perfect).  I have 2 boys in football so the burst speed on the old one was OK, with this one I have parents asking me to forward them all the cool pics I get! They actually made this model easier to use than the last one which was just a nice bonus!  And last thing that bothered me about my old camera is that it did not have a date stamp on it, I take trillions of photos and I NEED the photo to tell me when it was taken, the software included with the old one would not even imprint the date for me so I have 2 years of pictures that I am not exactly certain of when they were taken (I know it sounds silly but it really bothered me).  The new model does not automatically imprint the date but if I download the photos with the Sony included software then it does and that is good ehough for me!

I have used many cameras in my day from medium format to Nikon's best SLRs and nothing shoots like this at night. I took a photo of my back yard and it filled the image with enough light that you would think I have strobes set up in every corner. I look forward to using a tripod.

Over the course of three weeks I snapped 6500 pictures and a few dozen Video Clips.  Battery life ran 2 1/2 hours with straight shots and about an hour with video.  I strongly recommend a spare battery.  I would turn off between shots to extend battery but I completely drained the battery in Rome and really would have liked another hour of battery (the third party battery on this page charges great and is a superb value).  It does recharge very fast.  I got used to slipping the battery into the charger at every break and that gave the battery a fast extension for the afternoon shots.I added a 16GB memory stick but typically only filled 2-4gb per day of shooting.  Total storage from 3 weeks of pictures & video was 28GB.Honestly, I never read the manual.  I just kept flipping through the different settings to see what it would do.  However, I took so many pictures that the learning curve was very short.  If you're a bit timid you will want to take a lot of pictures with different settings just to get used to changing the knobs.Here's a couple obvious tips...but from experience:1.  Practice the Panorama setting.  It takes great pictures and provides a sweeping  view you cannot replicate except with this feature.  It's a lot of fun.  If you  burn up a couple dozen shots on panorama before you \"need\" it you will be ready  to hold the steady sweep needed to capture the full frame (not that hard but  practice is critical).  You cannot zoom with panorama so you do have to get  used to selecting the frame to properly fill the screen.  Taking a lot of  pictures is quite helpful since you can take a panorama get a bit closer and  take another series.2.  Video capture is really easy and is another fun feature.  I was rather shocked  just how nice the quality comes out with 1080p.  The practice part is just  handling the zoom in zoom out.  There are cases when a snapshot just doesn't  do justice to what the video can capture (like going 200KPH on the EuroStar).3.  Get used to the night time setting.  The multi shot per frame does an amazing  job in lowlight.  You would think this would blur...but the camera is great  at stitching 6 shots into one and the combined light looks great...it allows  you to take quite a few moderate light pictures that would otherwise never  turn out or completely washout with a flash.4.  Macro setting for close up is another handy button (all of these are on the  turn knob )5.  20x optical zoom is extremely useful for framing the shot on the fly.6.  It is a little noisy when taking pictures...really noticeable when taking  pictures where you're not supposed to.After taking over 7500 pictures I am very happy with this camera.  I considered upgrading to a DSLR but the compact size, the versatile settings and the picture quality let me stick with this camera for a while longer.Hope this helps.", "Date": "March 7, 2011"}, {"Title": "WOW !

Jaeger", "ReviewID": "R1L0W0OV1OKQLI", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I recently purchased the HX1 after returning a defective Nikon P100. I was a little hesitant to basically trade in a brand new model for a year-old one, but I was impressed by reviews and some of the features available on this camera. It turns out that I made a great decision.In most cases the image quality is very good. Yes, it does suffer from low light noise, but don't all point and shoot cameras?  The pictures generally come out very sharp and vibrant, and they look great when printed. The zoom on this camera is \"only\" 20x vs the P100 26x, and the difference is noticable. But it's also noticable that images are still sharp at maximum zoom, unlike the P100 which always looked very soft at its maximum zoom.  I gladly give up the little extra zoom for the quality of the pictures. Also, do not be scared off by the rather low 9 megapixels. If you are not making posters, this is plenty. I am still able to crop relatively small areas of an image to a 4x6 print and have the results look decent.The features offered on this camera are impressive. The stitch panarama is pretty amazing and the results look surprisingly good. Like most other cameras in this class, there is an intelligent auto mode. But the difference is that it actually works really well on this camera (I had terrible luck in auto mode on the p100 and especially the p90 and always had to use P/A/S). For portraits though, definitely switch to A mode and adjust the aperture accordingly. Burst mode works great for capturing just the right moment, provided the lighting is good (no flash in this mode). Hand-held twilight also works great.  It's amazing what the camera can do in this mode with very little light. The images in this mode won't be perfect by any means, but it makes it possible to get shots that otherwise just could not be captured.Also note that the battery life on this camera is excellent. The display also does a great job of telling you how much battery life is left, providing not just a battery fill icon but also a minutes remaining counter.The video quality is pretty good for a p&s; camera, but I still slighly prefer what I get from my Vado. Of course the HX1 wins out overall because of the zoom and all-in-one convenience.My main gripe with this camera is that it takes memory stick pro duo cards instead of the more universal SD card, but that comes with the territory if you buy Sony. Also, the menu sound is obnoxiously loud, even on the quieter setting. I keep it off except for the shutter click. These are just minor things however, and I would not hesitate to recommend this camera.Of course, when you buy a camera that has been out this long, you risk there being an anouncement of a replacement model coming out shortly after your purchase. I wonder if that may be coming given the recent price drop of this model. This is definitely a great camera though so if you are not hung up on waiting for the latest and greatest, now may be the time to get an excellent deal on a high quality camera.", "Date": "April 28, 2010"}, {"Title": "I'm a Sony", "Author": "S.

As much as I hate to say it, the easy and auto functions did a better job of taking photos then the manual settings did (due more to operator error then anything). I am sure once I get to learn the nuances of the camera that will change. Two real cool settings are the twilight setting as well as the anti-blur setting which are amazing for taking pictures of something moving at a high rate of speed. I found that with a little planning and a little luck I was able to take incredibly clear pictures from a moving automobile at over 120 kph (about 70 mph). It worked much better and much faster then the burst method of taking pictures. The anti-blur and twilight settings take a \"burst\" of 6 photos and combines them into one amazingly clear photo. Also the zoom is incredible. I could take pictures of things from such great distances and they still come out clear. I also used the zoom for a macro shot of some wildlife and the pictures looked like the shot was taken from inches away instead of from many yards away. This is a great \"bridge\" camera. Meaning that while it might not be a DSLR it is as close as one can get in the point and shoot category. One last side note, I watched someone take an amazing photo with what would be a similar camera but DSLR, while I was amazed by the quality of his shot, I was more amazed by the fact that it took him nearly 2 minutes to \"set the shot up\". I handed him my camera and said just push the button. The pictures were identical and he asked me where he can get one like it when he goes back home.

The Sony DSC-HX1 is an almost perfect camera for having both HD movie and high quality stills in one body.The movies are great quality and indistinguishable from my Sony HD movie camera.  The still pictures are excellent except in very low light with out the flash.  The Flash coverage is very good.  The Panorama mode is spectacular and unusual.  The lag time from pressing shutter button to when a still is taken is minimal and you dont miss shots because of lag time.  The LCD is big and bright and angles nicely but is useless outdoors  in the sun.  However the viewfinder is adequate in these situations although it lacks detail.  The wide angle of 28mm equivalent makes shooting indoors easy and the zoom range is just awesome and over 400mm.  And the quality appears to be the same across the entire zoom range.  The different scene modes work- the high speed action mode is great.  It anticipates movement and adjust focus accordingly.  I also purchased the telephoto auxiliary lens and took pictures and video at a NASCAR race in Dover that had cars on the other side of the track in full frame.  Battery life is excellent- practically it just goes and goes.  The 10 shots in a second mode ( or 5 or 2) works very well- although it takes a few seconds to empty the buffer to the memory card.  I love the size.  I am used to carrying an SLR and a Movie Camera.  This camera has replaced both and with no accessories except a charger, it is a delight to carry.  The audio quality in video mode is good and there is no camera noise in the background.Things I would like to see improved- Better screen in direct sunlight. Less expensive memory cards. Better natural/low light performance.  In good lighting the stills just pop with sharpness, clarity, and color.  In low light they are less sharp and are a little muddy.

I have a 9 year old who is a cheerleader, gymnast, and is very active in school. With all of these things starting back up - I went to get the Kodak ready and was unable to charge it (tried new charger and new battery).Went to Best Buy Saturday night (8/7/10) to look for a new camera (and being frequent BB shoppers we asked one of our \"friends\" there who would be the best person to speak with - he said Dan). I went to Dan and he asked what I would need this for - I told him I wanted a camera to do the things that my other one didn't - - I wanted a camera that would go from ACTION shots then to a Gym or Auditorium without having to adjust ANYTHING and still have great pics!! He asked if I wanted chargeable batteries or AA - - i said chargeable. He took me right to Sony's DSC-HX1.Well - while it was more than I wanted to pay - I had to have it!! After Dan showed me what I could do with this camera - I was sold!! Everything from action, to being in dark rooms, zoom, panaromic shots, to cropping/editing the pics in camera, and more!! I played with the camera all night (so did my husband who balked at the price - but actually played with it MORE than me). Of course our 9 year old was more than thrilled to pose - haha.But like I said - I am no professional - I am an everyday average mom who needed a camera to do what she wanted it to do with no hassle!! This camera is that camera!! Dan at Best Buy even offered a class if you needed lessons on working the camera - but it's so simple - I think I can wait right now.

From now on, I'm sticking to Sony for digital cameras. One of the best features is that panoramic mode. I think the only drawback I've personally found on the camera is that unless I actually set the camera to shoot in burst mode, I can pretty much forget about taking pictures back to back to back. I mean, if there's a way to do that without setting it in burst mode, I don't know about it yet. I'm still discovering new things that I can do with it, so, maybe it's just a matter of time.

The twilight mode works quite well in low light and produces some interesting photos.

The camera is VERY easy to use, I love all the features it comes with, especially the sweep (panoramic) mode. SO COOL!  It's very light, not as heavy as it may look.  My only issue is with the battery that came with it.  It's only been lasting for 30 minutes or so, then it says it's dead, and this is even after charging it for over 24 hours.  However, could just have been a bad battery and I haven't seen any other reviews on issues with the battery length.

If you will use for children, action and animals, is a VERY GREAT improvement. They improve the optical zoom, too. The zoom is great, but Nikon has a larger one. The colors of the Sony is very near to true colors. If you compare to others like Nikon and Fuji, Sony is very better. The other ones, have colorless pictures that you need to use some software to enrich it. It make 1080p HD video with stereo sound, I Don't know about panoramas...

The panoramic mode works but not every single shoot succeeds - some of mine were not stitched smoothly, one people's face was 1/4 chopped.The video side is a bit disappointed. When shooting on 1440x1080 HD mode, the unmoved objects are unspeakable clear, but for the moving scenes, such as shooting city building from a moving car, or even just zooming in and zooming out, the video is very unsmooth. I think it drops frames for some reason. But I figure I should use video cam for video and camera for photos only. I own a Sony SR-11 HD camcorder, the video is much smoother - it can take pictures, but just not as good as a camera with the same pixel numbers.Overall, the camera is well worthy for the price.

Hind sight is 20/20. Lesson learned. This camera is wonderful and I am an idiot. I have now used the Nikon P100 (returned 2 due to lockup and then some more serious issues), this one, the Fuji HS10 and now I own the Panasonic FZ35. The sony has the BEST picture quality simply set to auto. The next would be the Nikon and Pany tied for 2cd with the Pany taking much better quality photos, and the 3rd would be the HS10 which in my HUMBLE opinion STANK in auto.  I returned the Sony to Wolf camera basically because I wanted to try the new HS10 ,which hadn't been released yet, and the fact that I owned so many nice FAST SDHC class 6 and 10 memory cards. And then I end up returning the Fuji. After the Sony I realized how bad the pics taken with the Fuji really were. But it was too late. So I just got the Panasonic. I do like it, but I am still learning the camera. I only recieved it yesterday.  The Sony takes beautiful macro shots with SUCH ease, not so for me with the other cameras. It took lovely night shots, good indoor shots and all in an auto settings mode. I wish I could say I played with other settings but I really didn't. The in camera Panning mode works really well, again, MUCH better picture than with the HS10 in the same mode.  Colors were lovely and pics were SHARP. I loved that. I would get some over processing, but I now realize all I had to do was go in and change the settings, tweek it a little. Live and learn.  So I simply want to recommend this camera.

It has a solid feel, not very light, and you need to take advantage of the neck strap.  Low light photographs are unbelievably good, no comparison to any other digital I have used.  The panorama feature is very cool, but wait until you take a video and watch it on your 1080i/p LCD TV.  I have a Sony 46\" and I was knocked out by the quality of the picture and the color.  The sound is a little weak, but all things considered even the sound was acceptable.  The Sony DSC-HX1 features and Sony quality (made in Japan) makes the few extra bucks for this camera worthwhile.

This is a lot faster than any powershot I've used.  It focuses fast, and very well, and has a great burst mode. Its also sharp. The lens is one of Sony's best line of lenses.  I've taken many photos with this camera. I found the best setting to be the program mode with saturation up one, contrast normal, shadow detail off, and the ev down to -0.3.  I was impressed.  There are some who have mentioned noise as an issue.  I haven't noted a problem in my pictures, and I've made some big prints.  But I'm also an outdoors person. I shoot a lot of pictures outside and am only using the 125-200 ISO. On those two settings I've been hard pressed to find a lot of noise.  When I'm inside, however I have noticed noise on the 400 ISO setting. You will find this on a lot of point and shoots though.  Its not bad per say, but I wouldn't want to print a poster larger than 8x10 on 400 ISO. So inside I use the flash if it requires it.  The flash indoors is bright. I was in my kitchen and it lite up the living room quite well).  You can turn down the intensity if desired, but many wont.If there was one reason I would mark this camera down by a half a star, its the size. Its big. If your looking for something that has a decent zoom and can fit in your pocket or coat, its worth taking a look at Sony's h20. Its a 10x zoom camera with excellent reviews, and fantastic photo quality.  There is a basic optical principle that the greater the focal length, the less sharp the image becomes. Therefore, one might assume that the images might be better on the h20.  This however is not the case. While I wouldn't say the HX1 is necessarily sharper (they are both sharp), the lens on this HX1 issuperb. Because of this alone, i think this camera beats many of the megazoom cameras on the market today.  (You still get sharp images even zoomed in).Bottom line: Ive owned a Canon Powershot sd1000, 790is, sx10, sx20, and a lumix zs5. This camera is unlike any one I've used thus far. Sharp images, incredible zoom, excellent burst mode (ten shots in 10 seconds is a treasure for sports or nature goers), incredible video quality (Full HD is a huge plus and online videos show this quite well). I have absolutely no grumbles with noise at ISO 200 and below.  A lot of point and shoots let you get up to 400, before really noticing noise which can affect your print, but that's not the case with this one. This one Id say 200. 400 on this camera isn't bad. I would not hesitate to print 5x7s on 400 IS0, but if I were aiming for a large print, I would want 200 or lower. Of course, Im one to say this about any point and shoot that's not a SLR. Point and shoots simply have smaller sensor. If you want a camera which can take pictures well without using flash, you would do much better with a digital SLR.  But those are expensive. In terms of what you get in a point and shoot, this camera is quite impressive. I've been in plenty of woods with this camera in lower light and the twilight mode has really helped out a lot (it takes six burst shorts and processes those shots without a flash to give you one sharp image. So there are some ways to get around using ISO. I think sony purposely put that in knowing that noise above ISO was an issue. They took advantage of the CMOS sensor in this camera to use it for something that, while not helping much in terms of the noise on the higher ISOs, would help give one a good still shot in lower lighting with the twilight mode.In light of this, and the many other reasons listed, I would recommend this camera.  Its sharp, very very fast, has vibrant vivid colors on the settings Ive been using in program mode, and has a fantastic zoom.  Ive done multiple prints and have been very impressed by what Ive seen, both on the monitor and on prints.", "Date": "August 19, 2012"}, {"Title": "CONFUSED", "Author": "V.Q.M", "ReviewID": "R2O7W66TKU8M2D", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "I had to return this camera for a couple of reasons one of them being photo quality. Please read all the reviews on this camera. 5 star on down to make your mind up. I bought this camera because of the overwhelming majority of 4-5 star reviews. What I came up with is a mixed review from 5-1 stars. Some of everyone's complaints are filter through the all the reviews. I ignored them because what I often think is everyone has an option. Just starting at E-Z mode and what I like to call the green camera mode (on the dial for automatic) should of been the last resort when you just want to take a quick picture without using all the other options of manual, priority shutter, aperture setting, etc. etc. I have been taking pictures for a very long time and all around the world and love the idea of taking a quick great picture when I need to. This camera I thought would fit my needs as a quick shot of a photo by using the automatic settings or when I have time to select another setting for something creative. It has a wonderful zoom and ok micro. In the end I found myself only taking moon photos or just close ups. I ended up hating this camera because as one reviewer stated it cannot meet basic point and shoot features. True. I think it takes ok pictures under ideal conditions but if the weather is hazing or dark settings (inside house) without going through all the modes to get to the perfect picture then it pretty much noisy as they say meaning what I like to call the Fog. Never knew what Noise in digital photos meant until I own this camera. I own Sony cameras and Fuji cameras and this one I can't put my finger on it but I just plain do not like the camera.

The camera is lightweight and easy to carry, but really doesn't do what we need it to do with a baby. The pictures come out very nice, but again, because of the speed of the click they just don't get the picture you are necessarilly shooting.

On the up-side, the zoom is amazing and sharp.  It's also fairly easy to tote around and produces nice 4x6, 8x8 and even 8x10 prints.  However, I am really disappointed in the quality of 11x14 or 16x20 prints.  I have a Nikon D40 and a Samsung TL34 HD, and each of them produce significantly better large prints than the DSCHX1.  As I mentioned, I took this camera with me to Europe, and was very excited to print some pictures that I thought were going to be stunning based off of the image on the LCD screen.  When I got them printed I thought the place I had them printed at had done something wrong, so I had them re-printed.  Same results.  Turns out it's the camera that is the cause of this, not the printer.  After doing some research, I see that there are multiple reviews noting that this camera does not produce quality large prints.If you want a pretty good overall camera for general use this is a good option.  I just wish I had been aware of the limitations with regard to quality of larger prints.  Also, the battery life is just average.", "Date": "May 11, 2011"}, {"Title": "Surprising Sony", "Author": "Elainer7", "ReviewID": "R3034LJKAFSI64", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I picked this camera up for a trip I was taking and I didnt want to carry my DSLR while hiking.

If you don't have a CLUE on how to work these types of cameras, this camera is totally through with it's quick explanations on each settings and it take AMAZING photos...... MOST of the time! I bought this camera MAINLY for it's Video recording quality (1080p) but I still haven't played around with it long enough to judge.Pro:-It's 20x zoom is not bad. Still takes the photo in high quality.-It's convenience. The positioning of the buttons are not \"random\" a.k.a all over the place-It's Surprisingly smaller than what I have expected which makes it easier to carry around-The panorama is GREAT!!! That's all I got to say, just make sure that you are moving in a fluid motion when taking pictures.CONS:-The photos taken are \"ok\" it can get a little blurry at times and the lighting doesn't suffice in the photo results.-The capturing of moving objects are SOMETIMES messy and blurry so be aware of that when buying this product.-When it said, on the description, that this camera shoots under LOWLIGHTsettings, I was immediately attracted to this product. BUT, This camera does a comparable job with other non-dslr cameras, which made me kinda disapointed to find that this camera doesn't do a banging job in lowlighting.OVERALL: I really like this camera, BUT it has a flew flaws such as: lowlight performance, picture clarity, and motion pictures.

I have had Sony cameras in the past and I was happy with their performance so I figured I would go with Sony again.  I wanted to replace my current camera that was similar to this one, but a different brand (can't remember what brand it was...I think Nikon).  I was unhappy with my current camera regarding indoor photos.  They always ending up grainy and if I used the flash, they were always too bright.  This is the main reason I chose this camera becasue of the 'noise reduction' feature it has regarding indoor photos.Once I got the camera and started using it (it has been 11 months since I bought this camera), I was very impressed with the photo quality...even though it was less mega pixels than the camera I got rid of.  I was still slightly underwhelmed by the quality of the indoor pictures, but they were still better than the last camera so I decided to keep this camera.  My only other quip with this camera is that sometimes when you are trying to focus on something up close, it does not focus on what I want to take a picture of..more so it focuses past it.  But from what I have learned, this is just the quirks of auto-focus cameras.  There may be a manual setting on the camera to help this, but I haven't explored the issue yet.It has been almost a year since I bought this camera and I am still finding neat features on it.  Just the other day I found the feature for which I bought the camera for...the noise reduction setting.  I don't know how I missed it before.  Anyway, it basically takes several pictures over just a couple of seconds and combines all of them together to reduce the 'noise'.  All I can say is WOW!!  The pictures are so great!!  I have bought a photgraphy book to hopefully help me use the more advance settings on this camera.

If to compare to SonyH7 the HX1 has better zoom, HD video (I burned couple DVD's with great blu ray quality - AVCHD). However if to compare with H7, the HX1 does not have the same clear pictures. The image of HX1 has more pixelization (I'd say like a gray and white fibers chaotically placed on persons' skin) when you zoom in image on your PC. I compared it with H7 and Sony H7 images does not have this defects. It's pretty frustrating. The good thing I liked about HX1 is that it takes 6 shots and combines them in one - Hand held Twilight mode. I liked it till I found out about some other defects. The recorded sound sounds like in it an empty jar. It's pretty thin, there are no bass tones. And I couldn't find the way to change audio settings. There is no plug for external microphone. There is another defect. The pictures are crooked for objects what are located at the distance 1.5 - 2 meters from the camera if object close to the edge of frame. So, if you take a picture of group people, all heads of persons what were close to the edge of frame were shifted from upper corner to the down center). Funny thing that it happens right after picture is taken. So, in live view you see no deformations, then press the button to take a picture - here they are! I had to use Photoshop all the time to fix it. Same by the way for Sony H55.By the way 16:9 - 6Mp -max, 4:3 - 9.1 Mp. So do not be misled. In low light recording mode camera is Ok but not great. Auto focus is not fast in a low light in picture mode and bad in recording mode in the dark. Manual focus will be pain if you filming a show.

It has lots of features. But anyone who thinks that an ultra zoom \"works\" is deluding themselves.  There's barrel distortion at wide angles and the images at 560mm telephoto equivalent are not very sharp. The lens also produces images with relatively weak contrast.The camera does not allow one to manually adjust contrast or color. That has to be done post processing, and the lack of RAW images limits serious image manipulation.There's some other annoying design attributes. To view images in the camera, the camera obviously has to be turned on, but that also extends the lens and pops the lens cap off. The program control knob is loose enough that the sometimes you'll find it set for something other than expected -that is, it'll switch with casual use from, say, Intelligent program mode to Easy or Vibration mode. Sure, that's user \"error\", but the engineering could be better.The main problem, though, is the optics for any advanced amateur. Sony can and should do better.", "Date": "May 9, 2009"}, {"Title": "Review of Sony camera", "Author": "Rebecca A.

Firstly, I had trouble understanding how to get the free card, because the instructions are pretty unclear.  Amazon was nice enough and rushed me a free memory card, but it does not fit the camera.  The free memory card is an SDHC card, while the required card is a Memory Stick Pro Duo flash memory card.  Without the card, the camera has only 11mb of memory, so it only holds a few pix.Despite the fact that I haven't taken any pictures, the camera itself is of high quality and I'm eager to use it.", "Date": "April 20, 2010"}, {"Title": "Better have the correct tube adapter for len's", "Author": "C.
