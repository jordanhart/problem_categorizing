Cox", "ReviewID": "R1CZFSQB6LVIMV", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "I've just had this system a short time and I can't determine if I like it or not.  True, it's very easy to set up but configuring the software to view online could be a bit tedious if you are not a techie.  You will have to deal with configuring your router/modem as well, to get the right settings.  So be prepared for that.  But what is most shocking is that e-mail alerts does not work.  After days of struggling to get this to work and thinking that I must be doing something wrong, I decided to contact SVAT customer service.  I received a call from one of their support guys who told me point blank that the e-mail function does not work.  In his words \"when they tested it in China it worked, but after they were shipped to the US that function never worked\".  So I asked about a firmware update, I was told none was forthcoming.  The was a big disappointment for me because I wanted to be alerted.  My blackberry phone is not compatible with the unit, so I can't view my cameras from my phone.  But in the interest of full disclosure, I was relatively happy with it until I learnt that email alerts does not work.  They need to make people aware of this.  I wonder how many other SVAT models are like this.", "Date": "December 9, 2010"}, {"Title": "Great Value For What You Pay For", "Author": "Ho Nam \"Bacanshishimo\"", "ReviewID": "R2QMU1FARAJW1R", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "This system in theory is relatively easy to install.  However, climbing up ladders all over the house to wire de cameras was no easy task when you have a large house.  I planted most of my cameras outside.  My home had been burglarized twice.  Since then, we installed an electrified fence where the burglars entered, an alarm system and motion detecting flood lights.  The cameras added a layer of security.  I installed the monitor where all the cameras feed their images and placed it right on top of my TV.  Since I spend most of time time in the family room, this was a convenient place to put it.  Here are the Pros and Cons of this system for those of you considering this product.Pros:Great price, easy to install, made with good materials and components, fantastic night vision, and fast deliveryCons:The elbow where the camera connects to the base that holds it to the wall needs a lot of improvement, I wish they made the cameras wireless (for convenience and security, anyone can easily cut the wires if within reach), the camera wires can only be extended by one additional 60 foot extension cord only, no zoom option for the cameras.", "Date": "January 15, 2011"}, {"Title": "Good Product for the Money", "Author": "A. Newbaker", "ReviewID": "R14MW8KX0HEXGA", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "This system is for the paranoid on a budget.I installed this system at a business and was trying to figure out where to put the last 2 Cameras.  8 are more than you'd think once you start considering angles you need covered. I was able to have a constant overlap to where you are always on at least 2, usually 3 cameras at once.The installation went smooth, but my dvr was slightly screwy when I fust hooked it up.  None of the buttons on the face would respond.  However, the remote and the mouse (which I recommend you use anyways) worked fine, so I was just going to deal with it.  After 3 days of running cables, going to purchase a lcd tv, and wiring everything I turned it on and was impressed with the quality (night vision especially).  I set up the motion detection so the DVR could hold more.  Set the time and date.  Big Note! Be careful when tightening the set screw for adjustment.  Confirm that the camera is slid as far back on the wall mount as possible, and only tighten as much as will hold.  A previous install with a 4 camera system i did recently I over tightened (easier than you think) and broke the set screw part on the camera.  I used JB Weld and a zip tie to repair it and 4 months later it's still holing strong.Conclusion:  Slowish interface coupled with low end equipment give you a surveillance system on a budget.  You can make out smaller details and night vision is not bad at all.  Overall, this is a good buy for $500", "Date": "October 2, 2011"}, {"Title": "Adequate features, questionable design", "Author": "Denise Hughes", "ReviewID": "R2SYVW79W2FZHW", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "Cameras:The cameras are decent quality -- pretty much what you'd expect out of a standard definition analog camera. The IR illumination LEDs are sufficient for an indoor area such as a hall or doorway, but do not product enough light for outdoor scenes such as a driveway. The cameras have aluminum casings rather than plastic which was a pleasant surprise. The provided video cables are a bit thin and may incur interference. They are comprised of a bundled video lead which is terminated with BNC connectors and power leads which terminate with common coaxial DC power connectors.Software:The system's main software, aside from what (junk) runs on the DVR, is an ActiveX control that is compatible only with Internet Explorer. As long as your computer will support it (Windows-only), it works fairly well and allows you to view live video, playback recorded video, and configure most of the system settings though the web browser. The package also includes some apps for mobile devices. I only tried the Android app, which was a little sketchy to get running. Aside from figuring out how to install a raw .apk file onto your phone with no instructions, you have to configure several port and network settings both within the DVR and the app. These port settings do not share a common terminology between the DVR and the app, so it becomes an exercise in trial-and-error to get the app to connect. Once it does connect, live video can be viewed from an Android phone, albeit at reduced quality. There doesn't seem to be a way to playback recorded video or check motion events from the phone. Also the Android app seems to be ... stolen from some other security camera manufacturer. It contains branding and product names that seemingly have nothing to do with SVAT or this product. Regardless, it was able to connect and work.DVR unit:The DVR itself seems to be a computer running some flavor of Linux with the SVAT application loaded. The system boots fairly quickly and reliably after power failure. The hardware contains 8 BNC video input connectors, two composite video outputs (one is BNC style), one VGA video output, two USB ports for mouse and external storage, and some kind of digital I/O or trigger with screw terminals.The interface is fairly straight-forward if a little clunky. I found it much easier to just assign it an IP address and configure the rest through the web interface rather than grind through the menus and enter settings with the on-screen keyboard. The manual is terse and contains more information about configuring Internet Explorer and registering an account with DynDNS than this product (Also, DynDNS is apparently no longer free to use, as implied by the manual).Now my gripe, and the reason for my below average review: neither the remote control nor any of the buttons on the front of the unit will work reliably if you use this product with a monitor connected to the VGA port. After numerous calls to SVAT support, I gathered that the unit expects your monitor to be connected to the composite output and the menus will only display on that output. There is a (undocumented) key combination of Function->Up Arrow->Enter that will supposedly allow the interface to work on the VGA monitor. Out of the 50 or so times I have entered this combination, it has worked only three times. When it works, the unit will beep and suddenly it becomes responsive -- until the next power cycle. 95% of the time that I have owned this product, the front buttons and remote have been completely useless and unresponsive. SVAT technical support acts as if this is by design and acceptable. I have called many times and explained that their secret key combination to enable the interface rarely works, and their only suggestion is to keep power cycling the unit and trying until it does work.Luckily I was able to get the unit network-enabled early on, so it is mostly usable through the web interface. However I view the complete unresponsiveness of the front-panel buttons and remote as a significant defect of the product, and apparently SVAT has no remedy -- caveat emptor.", "Date": "June 28, 2012"}, {"Title": "Good System - Good Value", "Author": "Normal Guy", "ReviewID": "R3MW8LLJL1V4Z", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I purchased the CV301-8CH after doing research on various home security products and finding good reviews for SVAT solutions.  I didn't need eight cameras as offered with some of the other solutions, but I did want 8 channels on the DVR for future expandability.  The CV801-8CH package was a good fit at a reasonable price.  The package arrived promptly and was exactly as advertised (no surprises).  I was able to set it up and check it out with cameras just sitting on the floor in about 30 minutes.  One minor frustration is that the documentation leaves a bit to be desired in terms of usability.  There is a hardcopy quick start guide and a mini-CD with a full manual in PDF form.  I am very comfortable working with new systems but there wasn't a good overview of how everything hooked together from camera connection, to set up, to reviewing video.  It was easy enough to figure out the basics when it came to setting things up via the DVR menu, but it would have been nice to have a good overview and some specific examples of what could be done.  The only significant issues I ran into revolved around network access.  First, the online interface does work with 64 bit Windows systems - that would have been nice to know up front. I also had challenges getting remote access working but the technical support folks were very helpful and the issues were resolved in less than an hour on the phone.  Be advised that if you want to access the system from a mobile phone you will likely need to download a free app.  I used a package called ASEE.  There are versions of the app for Androids and iPhones.  Once everything was set up, accessing the system from my phone is easy and pretty cool.My single biggest frustration with the system is working with the DVR software.  Based on what I have seen so far, you can only configure and manage the system from the DVR.  The network accessible functionality only provides access for camera viewing.  It would be nice to be able to configure and manage the DVR from a computer on the same network but it doesn't look like that is an option.  Configuring and managing the DVR requires using a locally attached monitor and a mouse.  This forces placement of the DVR in a location that is easily accessible which is somewhat contrary to an effective security system.  In addition, there is no keyboard option so the mouse has to be used for entering keyboard strokes.The quality of the camera pictures seems okay but I won't know for sure until I get the cameras installed in their actual locations.  Which leads to another observation: camera installations where the cables have to go through a wall (i.e. on the outside of a house) require a BIG hole because of the two connectors on the end of the cable.  In my case I ended up with a 3/4\" hole in the wall.  Overall I am satisfied with this system so far.  I can't offer up a conclusive opinion right now because it's going to take some time to get the DVR installed in an appropriate location and get the cameras set up.", "Date": "May 29, 2012"}, {"Title": "SVAT CV301-8ch review", "Author": "Halo Dude", "ReviewID": "RELIHGNS0V9BA", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "There are 2 reasons for a 2 star rating. The instructions for setting up your smart phone to view the cameras over the internet is vague and took a lot of time figuring it out. Also, the email feature doesn't work at all.

This is one of the main reasons I bought this unit.I wrote the company and left a message for the customer support supervisor. If I get satisfaction I will redo this rating.The instructions for setting up your iphone, blackberry etc should include that you MUST change your ip address on your computer to anything other than the starting number 192.

It worked...mostly.  In one event, a camera stopped recording motion-based activity for a single 5-minute window that would have caught the neighbor stealing a piece of property from our yard.  That ironic timing doesn't help me like this product any better.  But in the remainder of the events of her efforts to steal or damage our property and home, it was caught on camera and helped us greatly with the police and the courts.Some things to consider:- These cameras are designed for very close range use, such as a covered porch or an entryway.  We are using them to watch the property line.  That means having a camera watch an outdoor line of upwards of 75 feet.  These cameras weren't designed for that.- The camera quality works great to prove nefarious activity occurred but you'll have difficulty identifying an unknown person at anything farther than 5 feet.  But if you know who the perpetrator is or if they are uniquely identifiable, then you can use them for longer range purpose.- The quality of the contrast control is pretty poor.  If you have a heavily shaded/sunny mixed area with a low-mounted view, the image washes out very badly, rendering things virtually useless.- Mounting and connecting is a breeze.- The mounting pedestals have a slightly weak grip and could slip a little.  You need to be careful to not over tighten it to compensate (in order to hold the camera steady).My experience:- I had to send multiple cameras back twice during the 1-year warranty to have them refocused.  I can't say the results have been all that great but it will have to do.- I had to set the DVR to reboot every night in order to make sure certain camera feeds continued to record motion.  Otherwise, some of them would simply stop recording on their own.- The DVR menus are pretty easy to navigate but watching recorded video is MUCH easier from the computer desktop software provided.- Because the DVR had to be installed in an upstairs spare bedroom far from the home internet router, I bought a wireless repeater and am able to stream the video from there to the router.  That lets me watch the video on my desktop, laptop and phone.  This is a HUGE peace of mind while away for extended periods (vacation, road trips, etc.).- The night view with the IR LEDs works pretty well.  When there is snow on the ground, the cameras see as far as they do in daylight.  But there is inconsistent \"ghosting\" of the lens that I can't answer for.  On some nights, the night view is good.  Other nights, it's as if there is a fog in the air.  Not every camera does it; and those that do it don't do it consistently.Conclusion:While this is by no means an awesome system, it has performed the task needed at the minimum acceptable levels.  For the price, I'm okay with that.  But next time I have to purchase a home security video system, I'm willing to pay more (much more) for higher level of quality and capability.  In the end, I'm glad I spent the money on this unit because it busted our neighbor and sent a clear message of protection.  We're glad to have it, even with its shortcomings and quality issues.", "Date": "June 5, 2013"}, {"Title": "returned the product - unusable", "Author": "concerned buyer", "ReviewID": "R37XAKF0PBM9L8", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "This was a present for me and I did not choose it, however, in the spirit of Christmas I went ahead and installed the product.  My request was for a high definition camera set (they have since removed that line from their marketing).  Note that 2 of the 8 cameras did not work out of the box and 1 cable did not work out of the box.  Also, I needed a 100' run to the front of the house and my wife purchased the cables that were recommended by Amazon - they did not work.  I then ordered 2 other ones from Amazon - they did not work either.  So there is a very low tolerance for interference with this product.So I had the cameras up and running and set them outside to get an idea of how they would look.  To say the least I was very angry that someone would even sell this.  There is no color (at best a smudge of purple where the green trees are).  The resolution is so low as to look like a cartoon.  I could not make out my kids 10 feet from the camera.  The night vision is a combination of black and white splotches.  This is useless for security as you cannot recognize anything, at best you can tell that someone broke into your house.  The resolution is much worse than the 400TVL videos on youtube.Then I tried to call support - bad idea.  They did not pick up and I was stuck in phone limbo.  They I sent an email and they responded 3 days later with a form email on how to troubleshoot the cameras.
