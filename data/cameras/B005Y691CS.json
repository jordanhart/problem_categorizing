If you look up the GE 500 (black and white Pro series- This camera does everything that one does.Look up the features to that, This has all those. This one even films in HD. The only difference is the zoom.It has the 8x Optical zoom & 6 x Digital zoom with a total of 48x Zoom.This camera is more compact.It has 20 scene modes; even sketch mode which is super cool.It takes amazing pictures but the trick is to hold the trigger button for a fraction of a second and THEN take the photo. It has BLINK tech. It has a \"frame\" mode that you can send Happy Birthday pics in a pre birthday frame, It even has 4 different song modes for viewing your photos on slideshow.The pictures are crisp and clear. Seriously, you cannot go wrong with this camera.", "Date": "February 7, 2013"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": null, "Features": null, "Name": null, "ImgURL": null, "ProductID": "B005Y691CS"}}
