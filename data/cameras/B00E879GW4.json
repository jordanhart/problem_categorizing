{"Reviews": [{"Title": "It's just OK", "Author": "K. Roy \"T3\"", "ReviewID": "R15AXBKQ1HSWWS", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "I did a TON of research for months on which camera to buy.  Overall, I bought this one because Casio was advertising that they have the quickest \"shot\"... which translates to almost zero lag time and zero cycle time between shots.  This was exactly what I was looking for.  The camera takes quick shots when the flash is off.  When the flash is on, it is at least 1-2 seconds between shots, which is not what the research stated.  This was QUITE a disappointment for me.  Also, the video feature is 10x worse than my 8 year old Casio camera.  It doesn't video the whole screen and cuts the top and bottom of the view finder off... It is also VERY DARK when filming.  If you film in low light, everything will appear practically black.  It's HORRIBLE.  I waited and waited to buy this camera and did months of research only to be disappointed.  Wish I had waited for others to review it so I could have learned from others first before making this expensive purchase!", "Date": "October 17, 2013"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": "$258.00", "Features": "Product Dimensions package: 4.2 x 2.4 x 1.2 inches ; 7.8 ounces", "Name": "Casio EXILIM Digital Camera 16MP Red EX-ZR800RD", "ImgURL": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41odlD6T-lL._SX300_.jpg", "ProductID": "B00E879GW4"}}
