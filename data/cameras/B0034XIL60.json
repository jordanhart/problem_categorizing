I bought it based on the reviews I read, but had NO idea of all the different things this camera does!  It shoots videos and it shoots in \"sports mode\" - taking many pictures one right after the other so you don't miss anything. We have used this camera at some multiple-day music festivals and are simply amazed at the clarity of the pictures and how easy it is to use!  The sound on the videos is good (if your computer speakers are good) and a unipod solves the shake problem if you have one.  The batteries last pretty long if you aren't shooting videos - that seems to use them up quicker.  This is my first digital camera, and I bought it because 1) easy to use, 2) large preview screen and 3) uses AA batteries.  I was absolutely thrilled it did all this extra stuff.  Friends who took the same pictures with their cameras were surprised at the difference when the pictures were posted.  Ours were much better.  Highly recommend this camera - especially to the camera novice (like me).", "Date": "July 18, 2010"}, {"Title": "Great Camera", "Author": "A.

Good quailty pictures, chargeable battery and very slim.  Super easy to carry around.  When it got wet and died I wanted to replace it with the same model.  Alas, it is no longer made.  So, because I enjoyed my first Nikon Coolpix, I bought the L22 and was completly dissapointed.  It seemed HUGE compared to my tiny S203 and the pictures were always blurry.  It took extra seconds to switch from camera to movie and even to take a simple posed picture required 2.5 seconds of holding the button.  Not a chance you would ever catch a good candid shot.  I returned it and bought the S3000.  Best idea and worth the extra $15.

Beckett", "ReviewID": "RCXEZ1CV8ZVEK", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This is a great camera for everyday use, vacation shots, sports photos, and more. We take low-light, no flash photos with this on the \"sports\" setting for dance recitals and plays. The photos turn out terrific, and people always ask what camera we use because they are so impressed with the clarity of the shots.This camera has numerous features and settings. The navigation between settings is pretty intuitive, and the instruction manual has lots more ideas too. It has good video capability for capturing something in a video file when you don't have a camcorder handy. You don't need special software to upload photos from this camera - I have a card reader in my computer to do all that.The camera does a good job conserving battery life. We use rechargeable AA batteries without any problems for hundreds of photos per charge. It's compact and fairly lightweight, and it fits into a shirt pocket with ease.The large screen makes reviewing photos easy, and deleting ones from the camera is simple with just a touch of a button plus an \"are you sure?\" question to keep you from potentially erasing something in error.The 3.6x optical zoom is an improvement over the previous Nikon Coolpix we had, so this is now the favorite camera in my home! If you've had a Coolpix in the past and are thinking about getting a newer version, definitely do it! You'll find the operations and menu choices very similar to what you're used to, but with added improvements that you'll appreciate.We've not had any problems with the battery cover on this camera or the previous Coolpix cameras we still own. If you break the battery cover, it's time for a new camera, unfortunately. But it's very sturdy and reliable, so we've never worried about it much.", "Date": "July 7, 2010"}, {"Title": "Love this camera", "Author": "L.

My \"bar\" camera has always been a Canon, but I decided to try the Nikon Coolpix since I have always trusted Nikon's technology.The camera takes nice pictures and is a very good price for a 12 megapixel camera.  There is a large view screen, which is also a plus.However, there are two major downsides to the camera that I wish I would have known before purchasing:1) It uses AA batteries -- NOT a rechargeable battery pack.  This actually makes the camera more expensive in the long run, since you need to constantly purchase AA batteries.  It also makes the camera wider than battery-pack cameras since there has to be room for batteries.  Hence, a camera that doesn't fit in your pocket as well as other models2) After hitting the shutter button, it takes a LONG time for the camera to actually take the picture.  So being out at the bar, everyone has to wait a LONG time holding their smiles... almost uncomfortably long.

Below is my feedback after taking a couple of hundred pictures in a trip to Hong Kong.Pros:-low price-pictures are of good quality (12mega) and over 95% of them were in good focus and clear.  I printed about 150 pics (including Disney World in HK) on photo paper thru PhotoMax in Hong Kong for Mom in law and they came out very well.  They look good on computer too.-took about 10 video clips.  They all worked well on computer when replaying (the camera does not have HD format support yet in its video).-use AA batteries (I know some people do not like this as it makes the camera a little bigger - anyway just a little bigger only and OK with me) but I like it because if the battery runs out by accident and I have no replacement handy, I can purchase anywhere easily.  BTW, I had 4 rechargeable AA batteries and this camera took 2 at a time and so most of the time I did not run into the need to buy new battery.  You can take a lot of pics with just 2 batteries.  The only one time we had to purchase new batteries was because we forgot to bring the other 2 batteries out and the ones in use ran out.  This is much better than when a camera is using other type of batteries and you forgot to bring them out and you won't be able to use your camera in that case at all.-flash is OKCons:-the mode that has face detection just does not work.  If you use that mode, the pictures you got would be extremely extremely disappointing and that's why some other reviews here said that the pictures from this camera were very poor and this was because they probably have selected that mode.  If you stay away from using that and select other mode, the picture would come out just fine.  With that said, you are not really getting all the features that you pay for here.  Even this camera is cheap, the price per each working function may be more expensive than the others.  But too bad, I cannot spend more than $100 for a camera in my budget and so I have to stick with it (still better than not being able to get a camera at all).-the sports mode is only 1/250th second and its much slower than most of other camera (1/1000th second).So if you cannot afford more than $100 like me and you only care about taking reasonable good pictures easily (no sports - sports mode is slow), this may be the right camera for you.  If you can spend more than $100, you should check out something else and you can get better sports mode and higher zoom power, etc.Hope this helps.", "Date": "August 26, 2010"}, {"Title": "Really great camera for the price", "Author": "Amazon Customer", "ReviewID": "R36L5K5A6A0HBD", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I bought this camera for my teenage sons and it has performed beyond expectations.

It truly is a point-and-shoot camera, taking roughly a second to snap a picture. The menus and settings are very intuitive, and there seems to be a setting for every occasion. Close ups, parties, outdoors, sports, and lots lots more, even a built in panorama assist! The included software, Panorama Maker 5, has allowed me to make some scenes that look very professional. Closeups are very sharp, but it does take a little maneuvering to make the camera focus on the object you want, rather than bringing the background into focus instead. The end result is splendid, so the extra effort isn't all that bad of a price to pay.The only reason I gave this camera 4 stars is the fact that it's a bit of a battery hog. After an hour or so of shooting, it has already drained the two AA's to 65%. (When you hook the camera up to your computer, it tells you the remaining battery life and memory!

Mediocre flash photo results, purple fringes, severe noise in low light, and intermittent issues. Positives are good video results, bright LCD screen, and good-enough results in bright light. The battery compartment latch is useless, and has to be held together with a rubberband.This is my first Nikon camera. The combination of the price and the fact that it is a Nikon led me to purchase this camera. I have been using Canon cameras for 15+ years, and was very eager to try this barebones point-and-shoot Nikon. Needless to say, it has been a huge disappointment. Maybe I got a lemon, or maybe at the price this is the best I should expect to get.The positives:- Cute size.- Attractive red color.- LCD screen is bright.- Video results are good.- No settings to tinker around with, so a good option for someone looking for a simple camera.Negatives- The latch that holds the AA batteries in the hold is flimsy. The grip that holds the latch shut is so thin that the latch pops open at the slightest touch. You need to use a rubberband to hold the latch in place.- Photo results are very mediocre. In bright light the results are ok, but you can see a purple tinge at the edges. In low light the results are very grainy. The graininess is the result of the camera automatically choosing a high ISO rating.- In low light the flash does not do a good job of adequate lighting.- The photos look to be very much on the soft side. It's either that or they look out of focus.- Sometimes the camera just does not shoot. You have to switch off and switch on the camera back to take a photo.Nonetheless, for those looking for a basic digital P&S; I would not recommend this camera to anyone.", "Date": "November 17, 2010"}, {"Title": "Those other reviewers are trying to trick you", "Author": "Nightside", "ReviewID": "R2TSYYQRS1GSKR", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "Don't be fooled by the good reviews. I bought this camera for two basic reasons. I like using AA batteries because I always have the rechargeable ones at my house. I don't need a special camera charger. I can just grab batteries and go. Never have to wait. And #2 was because of the great ratings on Amazon.But I was tricked.There is way too long of a delay when switching between modes, the pictures come out blurry 8 out of 10 times, the colors on the LCD screen do not match the colors on the actual picture, the flash whitewashes everything.When you normally see a camera flash you think \"I'm done, now I can move.\" But not so with this thing. There is this slight delay. When the subjects think the picture was taken, the camera is still taking the picture, but they have started moving, and then it comes out blurry. But you don't see the result of the picture for about another 1 or 2 seconds. But by that time most of your people have already gone on with their lives. Now you have to ask them to pose again.Then you have color issues. The LCD screen is the viewfinder and you will see a yellow tinted picture, but then the actual picture will come out brighter, especially with the flash. The flash just overpowers and washes out everything.Also, the image stablizers cause a delay in what you see on the screen as compared to real life. As if the processor is running too slow. What is on the screen is about half a second off from real time, and is a bit choppy. They should have stuck with the viewfinder.We used the camera for 1 week and realized it was just worthless, and we are returning it. Either the camera is defective or the design is just cra- not well thought out- p.Here were some common phrases said while using the camera:\"Wait, can you guys come back the picture came out blurry.\"\"Oh you moved too much\"\"Wow  the flash is too strong\"\"Sorry, it takes like 2 seconds to snap\"It is horrible for those candid shots.

That is when I started to look around for other easy to use good quality cameras. I looked at a lot of my friends cameras and started to read all the reviews.One of my friends had the Nikon L20 and he loved it. I tried it out too and loved it but I then found out that the L22 was replacing the L20. I asked around and found a friend that had the Nikon L22 and he let me use it for a weekend. What a very nice camera. It did everything I wanted it to do and then some. All the pictures and videos looked awesome to me and I did not have one problem with it at all. All the pics were sharp and focused. What more could you want? East to get batteries! Yup this camera uses AA batteries and I had a boat load of them. Everything in my house seems to use AA batteries so a long time ago I switched everything in my house to rechargeable NiMH AA batteries. They last forever in this camera. Say if you were at a wedding or something and your batteries run out. Just go to your local corner store and get a few easy to find AA batteries or just bring a few extra from home. Life is easy for me. I hate the proprietary batteries that come with most cameras. The other good thing about this camera is it uses standard SD and SDHC memory cards. I got a 8GB SDHC card for $19.00 bucks. It gave me something like 2,200 available pics to take at 12MP. Needless to say I purchased this camera in sliver from Amazon.com and I take it everywhere with me. Remember it is a $100.00 dollar camera and not a $500.00 dollar camera.

The micro mode is great!  Another thing that helps prevent blurry photos is to use a tripod!  Especially if you're shooting important landscapes or portraits.  (Helpful hint:  when using a tripd you may want to turn image stabilization off...try a shot both ways and see which you prefer.)  As for battery usage...most cameras eat batteries if you're shooting a lot, which is why every photography book/course/instructor/owner's manual tells you:  carry extra batteries!  Now let's talk video...I am so delighted with the great videos this little camera makes!  I had a small digital camera which I paid half again as much for, and my Nikon takes better videos.  Again, folks, this isn't a $1,000 DSLR; don't expect it to be, and you won't be disappointed.  I highly, highly recommend this camera!  It goes with me everywhere I go, and it has not disappointed me yet as I put it through its paces.UPDATE:  10-17-2010:  I took this little camera to Biketoberfest, and in the sports/action mode using a panning technique I got crystal clear photos of the bikes as they went by me.  I shot several movies and the sound was awesome, and the movies are sharp as a tack!  The batteries, which I have had in the camera since I bought it, lasted all day and were still going strong.

I own three Nikon DSLR's and really like them all.As of a few months ago I owned one Nikon L3 point and shoot camera and one Canon A720 IS P&S; camera. The Canon seemed to be much better and I had a little cash to spare so I bought the newer version of each, a Nikon L22 and a Canon A1100 IS. For what I want, the Canon is much better.The Nikon isn't a bad camera, but it isn't what I want in a camera. There are not enough manual controls. You can see from a picture of the camera that it does not have the big button function selector on top. You are a slave to the Nikon menu's and they don't have nearly the number of choices that I want. There is no Program shooting mode, just Auto. Therefore it will not allow me to choose the ISO setting, which is improtant to me. Like most P&S; cameras it does not have a viewfinder so you are left to hold the camera out one or two feet away from you to shoot the picture. I want a viewfinder to look through so that my head helps hold the camera steady, which is VERY improtant in taking a picture with any kind of camera. Some, but not all, of the Canon P&S; cameras do have a viewfinder.If you can get past the limitations of auto selected ISO settings and can hold the camera steady, there is no problem with picture quality. My guess is that a lot of people who don't know as much as I do about digital cameras would love the simplicity of the L22, and the L22 is 40-50 bucks cheaper than most Canon P&S; cameras so it just depends on what you want in a camera.", "Date": "June 30, 2010"}, {"Title": "Great Camera", "Author": "Pamela", "ReviewID": "R2DSAETBT22FSQ", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I bought this camera for my son's birthday.

I used a a Nikon d90, a Sony a55, and this camera, a Blue Nikon l22 Coolpix, which stayed in my pocket for ALL the trip, and I am very happy to report after reviewing over 600 shots on the L22 Coolpix, THIS $95.00 POCKET CAMERA IS AMAZING!!!!!!!! 1- YOU HAVE TO HOLD THE CAMERA STEADY, 2- DON'T EXPECT ALOT FROM THE ZOOM FULLY EXTENDED, 3- USE THE AUTO MODE IF YOU HAVE ANY DOUBTS, 4-DON'T EXPECT PERFECTION IN LOW-LIGHT CONDITIONS, (although I did get some totally amazing outdoor shots with the built-in flash set to auto). Battery usage is above average(with lithium), I found the camera SO easy to use, easy to navigate, shutter was flawless, very quick( using a class 10, 4mg card), and overall was TACK SHARP on the images. Let me repeat, TACK SHARP on the images after reviewing on my Mac. My only major criticism is not to expect much with the zoom fully extended, the images are less than clear, although using a tripod helped this somewhat. I was pretty blown away with the shots, for a $95.00 point and shoot! The super-clear shots were the proof, and build quality was good, LCD screen was fairly good as far as resolution. Overall this is a nice, well-built, great-shooting pocket camera with good features, ease-of-use, and tack-sharp images, highly recommended.", "Date": "November 16, 2010"}, {"Title": "Greatly Disappointed", "Author": "Happy in Tennessee", "ReviewID": "R37P84H1HLJJ03", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I purchased this camera (at a store front, not Amazon) after reading all the positive reviews.

I did further research and found whole blog sites dedicated to this common problem with Nikon Coolpix cameras of all styles; not just with the L22.  There's a matter of \"thumping\" the camera that may bring it back, but it didn't work for me.  I then read from those who were instructed to send their camera in to Nikon for repair, only to be informed later that this problem wasn't covered under the warranty.  I was told to send it to New York to have it looked at.  No thanks.  Nikon got my first $70, but they won't be getting a penny more from me.

Roman", "ReviewID": "R3D7D3SXZBMDU2", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "I had a Samsung L100 that was probably the best camera I'd owned until it broke earlier this year. It seemed like the camera couldn't do anything wrong when it came to taking pictures, though the video recording left a bit to be desired. When it broke, I first tried my luck with the Fujifilm FinePix JZ300...and it was the first camera I ever rated 1 star (and I don't just give that rating out). So my next attempt was this Nikon Coolpix L22 here. I'd owned a Coolpix a few years earlier, and it took decent pictures. Oddly enough, this one takes slightly worse pictures, and there's a trick to getting non-blurry ones. That shouldn't be the case with what's considered a simple point and click camera. Keep in mind that I'm no professional photographer, nor am I one of those people who calls themselves one just because they take a lot of pictures and thinks the title fits. It's just a hobby, plain and simple. But I do know clarity and detail when I see it, and when it's missing.First things first, yes, most of the time your pictures will be blurry when using this camera on the Auto setting. You can set the camera down on a table or something with the self-timer on, and take a picture of something that's immobile, and chances are that it'll be blurry in the picture. Why? I don't know. But get this- there's a trick to getting an ok picture on Auto: zooming in just a little bit. I know, it sounds stupid, but the only time I'm ever able to get good pictures if when I turn the Macro setting on, and when I zoom in a tiny bit. If I zoom a little more or not at all, the picture is a mess, and not worth keeping. Some of the special settings like Sunset and all that can make for good pictures and set the mood beautifully, but after trying out all of them several times over the last 4 months, only 5 have been helpful.Other poor features worth mentioning include the random times it takes to process a picture. Sometimes you'll take a picture, and it'll be done immediately, ready for another. But then there'll be times when you'll wait between 5 and 20 seconds (yes, TWENTY seconds) before you can take another. And the times really are random too, they don't depend on how complicated the image was. Taking a picture of a full moon: just the black night sky and the white moon took 11 seconds once, while a ton of gorgeous fireworks that filled took a quick 2 seconds. Another time, the same full moon picture was 1 second deal. Crazy, but true. Something positive I can say for it though is that the battery life is very good. I've never even seen the Low Battery warning pop up, even on the 4th of July when over 300 pictures and a dozen or so 5+ minute videos were recorded.When it comes down to it, this camera isn't worth the full price I paid for it. At the current price it's going for, you could certainly do worse (Fujifilm, I'm lookin' at you), but if you can try out cameras in the store or have friends with cameras that you can test out, do that before blindly ordering this. Maybe I'll try hunting down another Samsung L100...", "Date": "October 23, 2010"}, {"Title": "Great Camera", "Author": "James Talley", "ReviewID": "R1TK251DJ49LCV", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "After reading most of the reviews, those good and bad, I decided to purchase this camera, and actually received it earlier than Amazon had stated.  With that said, this is a simple point and shoot camera.  I think the bad reviews (however, I'm concerned about the 'flimsy' battery door cover) were based on some folks not knowing how to 'use' the camera.  Basic camera operation, press the shutter HALFWAY, it beeps when it's focused, and then continue pressing the button all the way down.  Picture was taken immediately, no wait time like some of the reviews implied here, and the results were excellent.  Picture was in focus, colors were good, and overall for the price of the camera, it did a darn good job!  I took photos outdoors and indoors in various lightning conditions with overall excellent results.  I even used the macro mode for very up close shots.  I did find that turning the flash mode to the 'off' setting, prevented the picture from being washed out, and with the flash off the results were pretty good using ambient light for macro shots. With more use of the camera, I'll find out how great the battery life is, movie mode and some of the other advanced features.

Dommer", "ReviewID": "R3MGDMBAREX6Z9", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I've always felt that you get better pictures out of a \"normal size camera\" as opposed to these tiny ones that fit in your pocket.  While I still feel that way, I must say that so far I am pleased with this Coolpix L22.  I still love my bulkier Sony camera, but let's face it... sometimes you wish you had a small camera that would just slip in your pocket.  I was hesitant to choose one, but after spending some time reading reviews here, I decided to give it a try.There are mixed reviews here but overall I find that it takes pretty nice pictures.  I've always had better luck with digital cameras if you give it some time to focus by holding the shutter half-down before taking the shot.  Sure you can just slam the shutter button down to take a pic, but it seems to me that this method tends to rush the focus, sometimes resulting in a bad pic that otherwise might have been okay.So does this camera ever take bad pics?  Sure it does, and so does my Sony that cost several hundred dollars more.  If you are using automatic settings and you are not a professional photographer, you will always take an occasionally bad picture.  And virtually all cameras have difficulty with focus and grain in low light (unless you use manual settings and know what you are doing.... and have a tripod that would allow you to use proper low light settings without creating a huge blur).  Overall though for what it is and the convenience it offers, I am quite pleased with it (and I can be picky sometimes).  I have taken some of my best pictures with my Sony and also some of my worst.  This camera is no exception.I've also seen some reviewers complain about the fact that it uses AA batteries.  Normally I agree with that too.... I'd rather use a rechargeable battery pack.  Keep a spare always charged and you are good to go.  They usually last much longer than a couple AA batteries too.  HOWEVER, one of the reasons I chose this camera is *because* it uses AA batteries.  We tend to use this camera when we are in the middle of nowhere (i.e. in the forest) and it's nice to know that all you need with you is a pack of batteries that you can buy virtually anywhere.

I purchased it over the Thanksgiving day weekend, even though his birthday isn't until February.  Amazon did a great job.  The camera arrived in just a couple days.  Love that super saver shipping.  I just packed the box up into our closet to wait until the birthday party.Fast Forward 3 months.  We're in the middle of a 12 year old's birthday party...  and he wants to try out his new camera.  We took it out of the box and...  the battery latch is defective and completely broken off..  It won't hold the batteries in no matter what we try.  I then called support, explained my issue and pay to send it to them.  About 2 weeks later I get an invoice in the mail telling me if I want my camera fixed I have to pay 70$  That was almost what we paid for the camera NEW!I had them send the camera back to us.  I was very disappointed.  After doing many more web searches I have found that this issue is very common in the \"Coolpix\" line of cameras.(In fact google \"battery door latch\" and the first result is about a Nikon Coolpix...  many of the following results are as well)Now on to the technical side.  Once I got the camera back I used some electrical tape and taped the battery latch door shut so that I could do some side by side comparison's.Compared to my Panasonic Lumix DMC-FS3 8.1 Megapixel it fell short in every test I made with it.  Low light shots where blurry, there was a significant amount of noise in the images, and the colors appeared dull in comparison.  The video was dull and quite grainy.  The sound quality on the video was low and tinny.  The only bright spot on the camera was the menu's were easy to navigate and simple to operate.  On the Nikon the on/off was a push button and took over 2 seconds to power up, and to actually focus and take a \"good\" picture in \"easy mode\" it was more like 5 - 7 seconds.(fastest = 5, slowest = 10)  The Panasonic on the other hand has an on/off slider and was taking 3 - 4 seconds for a power-up shot.  In the size department the L22 is pretty large for a \"point and shoot\" it was much larger than the Panasonic.  For Menu's between the two.  I liked the layout of the Nikon.  At first glance it was easy to setup \"favorite modes\" so you could easily switch your camera between Auto, Easy Auto, Video, and 1 preset mode.  But in function it was very slow.  You'd push the button and nothing would happen.  Press it a second time and watch the menu's flash up, then down again.  It just wasn't very fast.  The Panasonic took a bit more work getting the presets enabled, but it was very quick.Over all, based on it's performance I'd give it a rating of 2.  Based on the poorly designed battery latch, and the poor reception we received from Nikon support...  I will be giving this product a 0.

But for times I visit a museum where they do not allow large cameras (or, as one exhibit told me, anything with a detachable lens) this L22 works quite well, capturing images in all sorts of different lighting. The available settings (flash, no flash, sports, portrait, etc) are a nice feature for an inexpensive quality unit. There is even a \"museum\" setting. The 12mp image size is great. I typically use AA batteries (Duracell or Energizer) and they last for an extremely long time, probably a good 200-300 shots, maybe more.

I will keep the other digital camera a 6 MP Sony Cybershot that has served us well as a back-up.The Nikon Coolpix L22 12.0MP Digital Camera is very simple to use, but if you want to make any changes to settings then you will have to go into the settings menu rather than using a dial setting like on many cameras, but I have found that in most cases I use the same settings time and again.  But with practice you can get used to the new way of doing things.The camera arrived on time just before Christmas so I gave it to my wife a little early so she could start getting used to it before the family got together for the holiday.  When we got over to my son's house my wife quickly pulled out her new camera from her purse to take a picture of the grand baby and she fumbled it and it flew out of her hands and onto the hard tile floor, pieces flying every where.  I couldn't help myself and said something to the affect \"Oh well that didn't last long\".  As we started gathering up the what I thought initially were pieces of the camera I realized that it was the two AA batteries that had flown across the floor when the battery compartment opened on impact.  I put the batteries back in the camera and tentatively hit the power button and to my delight it came on and went on to take the sharpest pictures I have ever seen.  There was not so much as a scratch on the camera.  I certainly wouldn't recommend trying such a brutal test, but I would say that it is an indication of the quality and reliability of the camera.  It made me think of the old Timex commercials - \"It takes a licking and keeps on ticking!\".A serious or professional photographer would not want this camera because it does not give them the quick control they want and need over the shots.  If you are a serious or professional photographer than you probably are not reading this review and if you are there is no point in tearing it apart because it doesn't stand up to cameras costing many times more than this one.  After reading some of the negative reviews I feel that the writers are in a different category of camera user than most of us.I paid $80 at Christmas time 2010 and now I see the price has dropped down to less than $76.  At that price I am not going to complain unless the camera doesn't take a fairly decent picture.  This camera takes such clear shots that it can be a little unnerving.  I personally will not take a close-up shot of myself with this camera because you can see every little skin blemish and wrinkle.  These days I prefer blurry photos of myself. ;-)The only reason I gave it less than a perfect 5x5 rating is because I have not used the video much and that I haven't used the camera enough to make that kind of judgement and I have not had any contact with Amazon's Customer Service department and with all the things that I buy from Amazon I suppose that should tell you something.  I will follow-up with another review if there is something worth reporting on.If you want a camera that will take very crisp, sharp, great pictures and is small enough to carry in your shirt pocket or handbag and is an absolute screaming bargain on price then I think that you'll be very happy with this camera.", "Date": "January 21, 2011"}, {"Title": "Its OK for the money", "Author": "LightningGal", "ReviewID": "R1DV3I8RF1THIR", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "I bought this camera just before Christmas because I dropped my HP camera and broke it.

Since my HP camera was like $59 I figured this would be fine.When I first got it and took some test shots. It took nice pictures (I was in a well lit room). But I went to a party a week later and was trying to get some pictures of my friend dancing (a truly rare occasion that HAD to  be captured on film). The camera refused to take a good picture. They came out dark, blurry - just awful. On my HP I could force the flash. If this camera has that option, Nikon has done a phenomenal job hiding it. HP just put a flash button so it was very easy to figure out. Often when I go to take the picture and click to take it, nothing happens. I hold the button down and nothing. I release and click again, THEN it decides to take the picture. Meanwhile, my audience is trying to be patient and hold the pose. Annoying.The video is also just OK. It is definitely better in well lit situations.So I rate the camera as \"OK\" because it does take good pictures in good lighting.

I understand that resolution will be better the smaller the image is, but the pictures were not lacking in resolution- they were just plain blurred- like the photographer moved.  This should have shown up better on the camera's screen so the photographer would know to take another shot.  In addition, I was under the impression that the camera had a stabilization feature that would reduce the liklihood of blurred shots due to camera movement, but perhaps I misunderstood that feature.  A number of the pictures had questionable color quality.  Reds looked like hot pink, and it was not possible to properly correct the red color without affecting other aspects of the photos, such as skin tones.In order to be fair, it is not the top of the line model, and maybe my expectations were too high for the model I purchased.  It is possible that some of the problem lies with the operator and not the camera.  I hope that photo quality improves as I gain more experience with it.

Lomenzo \"Doc Tony\"", "ReviewID": "R3G145SBTW8IPZ", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Before I begin, note Amazon comment that there is an update of this camera, the Nikon \"L-24\" while this review deals with the almost identical L-22 model but I note the 'updated' L-24 offers 14.0 megapixels while the L-22 offers 12.0 megapixels. Since my overall savvy of photography AND cameras consists of two words, viz., \"point and shoot\", I'm hardly the one to comment on megapixels or anything else camera feature wise since the L-22 under review was/is my first 'digital' camera. Here's the story in brief: I kept noticing folks with 'digital' cameras and I commented after watching one long term friend shoot pic after pic in succession, \"how many pictures can you take with that thing?\" and he responds that with his 'memory' insert, he can take 'hundreds' [!] of pics! Needless to say, I was still using those instant flash cameras with the 26 pics and then you get the film developed routine but I decided to take the plunge into 'digital' cameras especially since our grown children introduced us to Facebook and this business of taking pics and then [if one wanted to] immediately transferring those pics [via the supplied USB cable that comes wsith the digital camera] into the computer picture gallery and then on to Facebook! I was so fascinated by the process and which admittedly has been around for some years but, hey, you know the old story, you tend to keep with the familiar and 'digital' cameras 'do' have the proverbial learning curve until you know what you're doing! Anyway, I went a further step and bought one of those photo digital copiers [the Epson V30 which I got on sale and free shipping at Amazon] and then I could put family pics on Facebook [not to mention digitally \"preserving\" them from the ravages of time!] and old classic pics and even [with the V30] take some of the time caused smudge marks out of the pics and even enhance the color of older color photos!Anyway, this is an excellent starter 'digital' camera and I'm well pleased with it. I'll even share this with you -- at the recent 2011 Memorial Day parade, I don't know how many times and out of pure habit I went to bring the new digital camera up to my eye and then it dawns on me that the 3\" viewer is where you frame the pic and there is no \"old time\" single eye-view gizmo but it gets better -- I take a bunch of parade pics using the 3\" screen viewer but did I even remember [equally out of habit] that the digital camera even 'had' a 3.6X 'zoom' lens? Noooooooo! But get this and my point here, while later on reviewing the pics in the camera 3\" viewer, my index finger 'accidentally' touched against the zoom lever and the 'standard' pic I'm looking at [and as I originally took the pic] suddenly increased in size! In effect, one can zoom the picture AFTER it's already been taken AND there appeared an icon of a scissors asking me whether I wanted to save the now \"edited\" picture [while preserving the original 'as taken' pic] and when I clicked 'yes', the 'edited' [read: now zoomed] pic was duly saved in memory! Then I 'discover' that the zoom can be further increased AND the pic can even be 'panned' so that it can be centered or even certain objects taken out! This was news to me! Yeah, I know, and I can hear you from here, to wit, \"Hey, Doc! When all else fails, read the manual!\" ;-)Couple of things. Don't misplace that USB cable because while the end which goes into the computer is the standard size USB plug, the 'camera' end of the USB cable looks like what I'd term a sort of \"sub-sub-mini\" plug. It's a 'very' tiny plug that goes into the camera. Without that USB cable, you can't do pic transfers into the computer unless, of course, you want to go the flash memory transfer route [putting the camera memory chip itself into the computer] ==but== you can only do that if your computer 'has' a flash memory reader! Keep the supplied USB cable in a safe place! You might also want to buy a protective holder for the camera because it does 'not' come with one and hey, it's still almost a C-Note to buy so you'll want to protect it, especially the 3\" viewing screen from scratches. Finally this, there is a quick read manual that comes with it and the full and lengthy 'explain all' manual is on a CD. The other CD is the Nikon software ==but==  if you have Windows 7 [dunno about Vista or Windows XP], you can use Windows 7 itself to set the thing up if all you want to do is transfer pics into your Windows picture gallery and/or do some minor tinkering with the pic using Windows. I let Windows 7 automatically set it up and it will do that the moment you plug in the USB cable coming from the camera unless you opt to do the Nikon software thing. For my needs and purposes, Windows 7 setting it up in seconds was just fine. If you pay attention to the 'in hand' Nikon \"quick start\" guide, you should be fine. The camera will also take short duration movies at 30 FPS! The \"trash can\" icon will dump any pics or short movies you're not pleased with or don't want to keep. Focusing is automatic and the camera has a standard size screw-in gizmo at the bottom to place the camera on a tripod. The flash is built-in and the camera 'sensor' decides [although you can over-ride that where 'you' decide when to use a flash assist] when it's needed and when it's not needed. It also takes out the old 'red eye' thing [with flash] but how it does this escapes me. All I know is that it works! As I said, for a beginner digital camera, I'm well pleased with it and even if you're a pro, it's light weight, reliable [thus far!] and fits in the palm of your hand or T-shirt pocket. Various camera colors are available too. Comes with a tie-on nylon holding cord but 'not' with a camera protective cover. Ironically, the updated L-24 Nikon [with 14.0 megapixels] is presently $5 'cheaper' than the L-22. You may wish to compare the 'updated' Nikon L24 features with the L22 and make the call as to which one you buy although my understanding is that the the more megapixels the camera has, the sharper the image. I also assume that with the updated L-24, the L-22 should further drop in price.Doc Tony", "Date": "June 18, 2011"}, {"Title": "Really not impressed", "Author": "Nina Weber", "ReviewID": "R2RCTAXDHPVLQ", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "After owning this camera for 8 months, I have decided I really don't like it and will be replacing it.

The photos turn out grainy and blurry, and most of the settings are useless. You can't tinker with any of the settings so there is not much flexibility at all. I absolutely DETEST the flash: It flashes twice, so if you're taking pictures of pets or children, they will blink on the first flash, and and on the second flash their eyes are closed. So you will very rarely ever get pictures of your critters with their eyes open. You have to take the pictures over and over again and by then your subject is blinded! What's more, is that the flash is way too bright. Pictures come out looking very washed out with the flash on, and with the flash off the pictures come out blurry. There is no happy medium.

That is the only good thing about this camera.It takes forever to focus and take a picture. It is somewhat confusing to use. The full user manual is a DISC for a computer. What if you wanted to look something up but didn't have a computer nearby? COME ON! And the quick start guide looks like it'd have a lot in it, but it's too busy covering 3 languages in addition to English. Pictures taken in dim lighting that would benefit from flash, apparently don't trigger the flash. About half of pictures come out dim, yellow, grainy, out of focus or a mix of all four.

This camera also eats batteries like crazy. I can't take over 100 picts and review them without having to find new batteries. My last camera, a Cannon something or other that was like 5 years old hardly needed batteries.LASTLY, my biggest complaint about this camera is the battery door. If you touch bottom every so slightly the door will pop open throwing the batteries all over. Idk how many batteries are lost underneath stuff at my house b/c of this. Sometimes it even throws open with so much force that the memory card gets loose. So don't even bother trying to take this to the bar. With the batteries not staying in, potentially losing your memory card, and the amount of time it takes to get a picture, it's not worth the stress. I would tape the battery door closed but since the camera goes through batteries so fast it's just not worth it.Save yourself the sanity.

The camera is user friendly and the zoom options are easy to use. The Nikon L22 takes 2 AA batteries instead of using a battery pack. Which I think is better for beginner camera users.

I wanted to replace it with another inexpensive point and shoot camera of equal quality and the one I was replacing was no longer made. I saw this Nikon L22 for very good price and trusting the Nikon name purchased it. It has been a big disappointment. My Canon had a sports mode that I used to reduce blur and I could take pictures without flash in very low light and still get bright pictures with correct colors. The Nikon not only has a sports mode but also image stabilization but I can use them together and get a blurred image of an inanimate object. The only way I can get pictures that are not blurry is to use the auto mode with auto flash. But then the flash fires in any setting other than bright sunlight and I end up with pictures that are washed out and colors that are not even close to being correct. They say you get what you pay for but if Canon could make a good inexpensive camera why can't Nikon? The canon also had an instruction book and the controls were so simple it took no time at all to learn to use it. The Nikon comes with a CD only so you have to learn to use it before leaving home and the controls are complicated and buried in layers of screens accessed through the menu button. Want to take a macro shot of a prized flower in your garden? That setting is a sub-setting under sports. Yeah, that's intuitive.

Auto only works so-so unless you are outside (or you have excellent indoor lighting conditions) taking snaps with little or slow movement.  After spending an hour or two taking photos inside and outside the house with all of the different modes, I was really able to understand what modes on this camera are best for what situations (hint: the mode names are just general categories, sometimes it is best to use another mode despite what it is named).I am able to take excellent photos inside of my house with this camera. Previously the only way to get a decent photo was with an SLR due to the complete lack of lighting in my house.  I live in a Victorian row house that has very few windows and completely inadequate lighting for pictures.  Also, I can actually take photos of my fish with it which other point and shoot cameras have failed at.I would suggest using SANYO eneloop 4 Pack AA NiMH Pre-Charged Rechargeable Batteries with this camera due to their low discharge rate.

All these things happening together takes up so much of the cameras processor that it can't activate the servo to zoom in.  turning these things off and selecting a scene mode improves this, but doesn't fix it completely and at that point you've turned off the main selling points of the camera.

I agree with all the 1 star reviews but chose to give this camera 2 stars because I was able to get some decent pictures out of it. I will never purchase a Nikon Cool Pix camera EVER again for the following reasons that I've listed below:We just got back from taking a family vacation over Spring break and this camera has given us nothing but problems.  The top of the line batteries don't last very long in this camera.  We constantly had to change out the batteries.  I was hoping to get better usage from the batteries and bought this camera thinking it would be more convenient than carrying around our lithium rechargeable battery camera.The flash on this camera is insufficient. There are times when it does not work and when it does, it whitewashes the entire picture!  I have experienced delay times when going back and forth between the different modes. Most of all of our pictures came out blurry regardless of whether or not the person was standing still.  You could be standing absolutely still and the picture will still come out blurry! There is a delay between the time you snap the picture and when your actual photo shows up on the screen.  I've also noticed that the shades in colors are also different on the LCD screen which is very frustrating.  We constantly had to retake pictures.  I've had to delete so many pictures.When using the provided USB cable to connect the camera to my laptop several issues occurred.  I kept getting error messages.  At first I thought it was my computer so I rebooted and tried again and got the same error messages.  I also tried on a desktop and encountered the same problems.  It took me forever to transfer pictures to my computer because an error message kept popping up stating, \"L22 is busy\" or \"Your device is not functioning properly\" and once the error appeared, the camera would lock up my system and then I would have to use the task manager to close out the program.  It also locked up my desktop computer when I tried using it on there.  When I was finally able to get it to work, I would still get the error message and if it didn't lock up my system, it would knock me out of the program and I would have to start over with the photo transfer!  I was finally able to transfer photos after struggling with it for over two hours!  That is totally unacceptable.  I haven't had a chance to read through the reviews to see if any other members experienced these same problems but having dealt with all these issues, I can honestly say that I will never ever purchase another one of these cameras again!

Carter", "ReviewID": "R3GDNA404GYOJY", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I use a dslr when I intend to shoot and only rarely use a point and shoot. The reason I got this cam was to have something small to carry around for the \"just in case\" moments; for example, on Christmas day I went disc golfing in the snow, and it would have been nice to take a few pics to post on facebook. The problem was that there was no way I was going to lug my 20d with a $700 dollar lens around in the snow for a few hours to get a few random pics. So I hit wal-mart and looked for something small, that took regular batteries, and could be stuck in a pocket or disc golf bag, and was cheap. This cam was the lowest priced item to fit the bill.I'm not a pro, but I regularly use a 20d or 40d (canon rules in dslr cams), have good glass, use a good flash, shoot only in RAW mode, fairly proficient in photo shop, and spend a good deal of time taking pics and post processing, so I have pretty high standards. I've also had a few p&s;'s, which take good pics in daylight, horrible pics indoors, and with the flash, take horrible pics in the opposite direction. So here's my review.....not comparing to dslr's, but in getting a decent pic in situations where you're not intending to shoot, but tucked a cam in your pocket just in case something interesting pops up.I set the cam up for the highest quality jpeg (memory is cheap, 4 gig cards are only $10 and hold over 500 pics). put the cam in auto mode, and disabled the flash. The controls are dirt simple, and except for the jpeg quality, can all be done easily with the buttons on the back of the cam. ISO is set internally and you can't mess with it; it seems to stay on the low end, which is normal for outdoors, gives a seemingly slow shutter speed indoors. With a little care to hold steady, I got fairly sharp pics at 1/6 sec shutter speed ( slow shutter leads to blur because you move during the time it takes to snap the shot). There is obvious noise reduction built in which give the pictures a \"smooth\" look, but cuts out a lot of the graininess that you get shooting indoors. All this means that the pics kind of have a little blurry look inside in low light, but for what your using, it's not all that bad. It looks to me that the outside pics have a touch of this also, but still yields acceptable pics. Outside, the auto white balance is good, inside during the day auto seems good too. Night need the setting changed to the type of lighting and its pretty good. If you don't change it you get the reddish orange hue to the pics. If you use the flash, you get that blown out look all p&s;'s have; too me it's just not pleasing. The exposure comp. matches what you see in the display and lets you get decent shots when theres back light situations. If you're a post processor you can get even dramatically better results if you know what you're doing.Overall, knowing what the limitations of this kind of cam are, I am impressed. If you understand exposure and how light works, you can get pretty darn good shots with a few button clicks. If you don't, the auto mode guesses what you're trying to do and gets it mostly right. If you are serious about photography, these types of cams aren't for you as a primary cam. If you're looking for something better than a phone camera thats cheap and easy to use, this fits the bill. If you're a serious photography looking for something that stays in the glove box or a coat pocket so you can get a shot without having something the size of a toaster hanging around your neck, this is a good cheap solution.", "Date": "December 26, 2010"}, {"Title": "Disappointing upgrade from the L18", "Author": "Chatoyance", "ReviewID": "R3URBTG28JV3Z1", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I had a Nikon L18 for 3 years and it was a pretty good camera.

The warranty, which theoretically covers the camera for 1 year, turns out to be worthless -- worse than worthless, actually, because you have to pay money to ship the camera to Nikon, for them to tell you that it will cost you more than the cost of a new camera for them to repair it DESPITE THE WARRANTY.

I plan on making another after I have had the camera for a while.The camera is very easy to use, I figured it out without the manual. The picture quality is excellent and very realistic; and it is not grainy like other cameras. Now it only has about 12MB of built in memory, but it has an SD card slot inside the battery compartment, and therefore I put my 2GB card inside it. The software it has does install slowly, but that is irrelevant to the camera. Just connect the camera to the computer with the provided cable and turn the camera on (the camera must be on for windows to recognize it)and windows should load the driver software. After that just navigate through the folders inside the camera and then you can copy your images. The folders are a forward path so navigation shouldn't be difficult.

The AA battery thing is something to get used to, but think of this: You are out in nature with no electricity to charge the in-house battery. ...well a six-pack of AA's in your pocket will definitley come in handy! Battery life seems to be good, I have yet to really put it to the test (got the camera 2 weeks ago). Video is rather good for such a small camera; the time left to record is on the screen. Buy the SD card!! it only has a 16mb memory, so 4/8/16 GB memory card is a must! I will be posting pics soon...(2 hours later...)I uploaded some pics in the gallery. The ease of use makes this camera suitable for a hobbyist photographer like me. The photos can kind of show what is capable, as well as some of the other photos people have uploaded. For the dropped price to 69 bucks, you can't go wrong.One downside is the camera has to be on when downloading shots, so don't forget to unplug the USB and shut it off - battery waster there.... did I mention to make sure to get a memory card...?! get two!!

Quality is great and the smart portrait mode works well when looking for the smiling subjects. As far as the zoom I found it much better to take the picture without zooming in and then use the software on the computer to zoom in and crop it there...pic quality is much better that way. If you remember there is a slight lag then you will get great pics if you hold the camera steady until you hear the click, if you don't then the pics will be blurry. I've taken many shots of buildings from a moving boat in the middle of a river and many of people and scenery from inside a moving car and they turned out pretty sharp and colorful. Outdoor shots are amazing and the movie mode is pretty awesome for a small point and shoot like this. Shadows outdoors can be helped by forcing the flash as a fill in. I recommend trying out the different modes the camera offers so you can see which will work best for your situations, after all you needn't worry about wasting film anymore, so take many pics and you'll surely get a few that will be the awesomes ones you wanna print!

Good color accuracy when in light. Like 10 seconds from button press to shoot (not bad but not great). Great and smooth video especially good for things like youtube and whatnot. Easy transfer from camera to computer; connect with required cable and then just drag and drop.Cons - It has a hard time getting color correctness on close up shots (especially dark close up shots) and it's a PAIN to take a picture of something more than half a foot in front of you because it REALLY doesn't like to focus in close-up shots. It is possible to take close up shots with good color with this camera but it takes several tries and messing with exposure settings (pretty easy to do but it would be nice if it was automatic). Sometimes it has some trouble using drag and drop and the transfer freezes halfway through and you have to cancel and start the transfer again. It happens randomly but it's just a minor inconvenience.But for like 70 bucks, it's FANTASTIC for your money.

It comes with a USB cable that allows transfer directly from camera to computer, a hand strap, two temporary batteries, computer photo manager software, a quick start booklet, and a CD with detailed operating information.The 3 inch monitor allows an image to be visible even in bright light and in the dark. I took it to the beach on a clear sunny day, and even with the sun shining directly on the monitor, I could see the image clearly.  In the dark the display is brightly lit. There is a selection of several languages for display messages on the monitor. Date and time including time zones can be set. Pictures can be played back so the photo shoot of the day can be observed and edited.There is a one finger zoom control (best for right handed people) on the top right of the camera.  All you have to do is focus and shoot after selecting a zoom size. It has an automatic face recognition feature that puts the face in focus when you point. The camera also allows you to make \"movies.\"The Coolpix has five shooting modes: Easy Auto Mode, Scene Mode, Smart Portrait, Movie, and Auto Mode (more flexible options).  It has a built in flash, self timer, macro setting for close ups, and exposure compensation that brightens or darkens the photo depending on ambient light conditions.You can keep the Coolpix on Easy Auto Mode and use it in most situations. But you can click on many specialty settings in a handy menu by selecting Scene Mode. Examples of these specialty settings include: Portrait, Landscape, Sports, Night portrait, Party/indoor, Beach/snow (the one I used at the beach), Sunset, Dusk/dawn, Night landscape, Close-up, Food, Museum, Fireworks show, Copy (black and white), Backlight (for an object in front of a bright background), and Panorama assist.The Coolpix L122 package is designed for quick learning of the camera's function. The Quick Start will get you going, but the detailed information and examples on the CD Manual will make you an expert on the camera in an hour. Once you know all about it, you realize it is the perfect camera for travel. My wife is a tour guide and is usually very busy on trips. She likes to take a lot of pictures and does not have time to make complex camera adjustments. She will be going as a passenger on a trip to China in Spring, and she will be able to use the point and shoot and special settings on the strictly controlled tour.This is an outstanding camera that was shipped on time and arrived in perfect condition.

My mom bought it for me because I recently moved from Atlanta, Georgia to Provo, Utah and needed a camera. I was able to take crystal clear pictures even while driving at 70 mph (the speed limit becomes 75 on I-80 from Lincoln, NE onwards)!!! Some of the pictures you can't even tell they were taken by a point and shoot, even with me driving.  Feature wise, I haven't really played around with it so it's all on auto, the flash doesn't wash the picture out at all. Easy to hook up to the computer and transfer the photos. The camera has a nice \"auto-sleep\" function that turns the camera off after 3 secs, you can change the timing or turn the feature off. It does take about 5 seconds for the camera to wake-up/turn on (I missed a couple of good shots because of this). The digital zoom gets in nice and tight and remains clear, the optical zoom gets fuzzy and shakey even with the anti-shake feature turned on. The buttons are perfectly placed (I have smallish hands) for easy use.Other than the slowish turn on/wake-up time, I love the camera.

I like the Nikon and the fact  that it takes AA vs specialty batteries. The issue with the first camera and the second one amazon shipped is that the nice 3\" display screen has a problem with pixels not following in the picture taking mode. The photos are fine but when you have a dark background you have a white spot on your screen. The first camera has it in the middle very annoying the second near the top less annoying they never change positions. I like the features and picture quality vs price so that I am willing to try a third unit. Both cameras came shipped in their display box in a thin plastic envelope.  The problem could be related to the abuse during mailing. As others have mentioned you can not set the ISO manually but the camera has enough specialty modes that you can adapt. It also has an easy auto mode where someone whose camera knowledge only goes as far as disposable cameras can use it, turn it on and press the button, it decides what works best. I think this camera is a great deal hopefully the third time will be the charm. otherwise 3 strikes it's out.Nikon Coolpix L22 12MP Digital Camera with 3.6x Optical Zoom and 3.0-Inch LCD (Silver)Amazon was reluctant to ship a third and offered a 20% discount or full refund.I opted for the 20% because I can live with the problem or send it to Nikon for repair if it annoys me later.

We really like the camera for these aspects.  The only issue I've had w/ photo quality is that sometimes the camera will decide not to use the flash for you, and I don't like this feature.  I'd prefer to choose whether or not I want the flash.  It's not that I can't choose this option myself, but I have to change settings when I'm trying to take a picture sometimes, which is just a little annoying, but happens rarely.  The video quality is decent, not great, but I don't really expect it to be more than that from a small relatively cheap camera.As for durability, I didn't give it a high rating bc we haven't had it that long so I don't feel like I really know yet.  We did have one incident in which I placed the camera on the floor while the lense was going back in.  I didn't realize it hadn't gone in yet, and the lense got stuck.  At that point we thought I had just broken a brand new camera.  Thankfully we were able to fix it and I have been more careful.  Another thing about durability w/ this camera is that it's plastic.  I'm sure it will get some scratches eventually, but that doesn't necessarily mean it's not durable.I only gave 3 stars for delivery bc it came a day late.  That's not too bad, but if they tell you the camera's coming on Wed. and you dont' get it, you start to wonder if someone may have stolen it.  Also since it was delivered by the USPS, I was a little more concerned about whether it got stolen.  However I know they can be slow so I gave it the next day and the camera came.  It was perfect in the packaging - no damage - and everything seemed as it was placed in the package from the factory.Overall, we give this camera 2 thumbs up.", "Date": "December 31, 2010"}, {"Title": "Nikon Coolpix", "Author": "klmdvm32", "ReviewID": "RY8YRZNRRBWVV", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Bought this as a gift.

I had ordered the camera thinking it would be simple to operate and would take better pictures than my previous digital camera.  Although the zoom was stronger and more megapixels, taking pictures from a distance is still very disappointing.  When trying to enlarge the pictures to print, they become fuzzy and a waste to process.On Veterans Day, I had taken quite a number of parade pictures and proceeded to download to my computer.  I had some older pictures on the memory card which had already been successfully downloaded to my computer. I was able to view all the new pictures I had taken on the camera, but when I plugged in the USB cable, no pictures would download except for the older pictures, about 15, which were still on the camera.  I called technical support about the issue, and he told me to take the memory card to a local store to process.  I did this, but the pictures were no longer on the memory card as the rep assured me they would be.  Somehow, the camera must have deleted all the important pictures I had taken.  This was very distressing to lose all my pictures.Also, the battery cover is extremely difficult to close.  What I had hoped for in a simple to use camera is a total disappointment with this Nikon. Included with the camera was a minimal instruction manual. A more complete instruction manual was in the form of an instruction CD that could be downloaded to the computer for reference.  This is totally unacceptable.  I questioned the tech support about this and he said it is part of the going green initiative not to send a printed version.This camera is a total puzzle to me as I have never had a digital camera that deleted pictures without my intentionally deleting them.
