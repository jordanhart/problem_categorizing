It was described as \"Protective Digital Camera Carrying Case with Pockets and Strap.\"  I did not get a bag. Hell no!  What I got was a \"Zeikos portable soft case.\"  Although Focus Camera did provide a lovely memory card holder by OSN which can fit four cards, the card holder was larger than the case they expected me to put the camera in. False advertising is what I call it. The camera is cool, the tripod is kind of retarded, the screen protectors are el cheapos that have to be cut and are not what is pictured, and if you are looking for that \"FREE 25 Quality Prints (promo code# on invoice)\" keep on looking peeps as it doesn't exist. I guess they made up for it with the Sony 16GB memory card other than the seemingly no name brand.  Yeah right.  If you are thinking about this bundle, forget about it. Buy things separately or get it from another vendor.I have posted two pictures. One picture depicts everything that came in my bundle so that you can see what they say they are going to send and you can see what I got. I also posted a picture of the camera case (cough) next to my mouse to give folks an idea of the size. IF you happened to get everything in the bundle as it appears by the seller, consider yourself lucky. If you didn't, complain. Sure the camera is great, but if you are going to pay extra for accessories, they ought to be what you paid for.

Both features served me well on a recent trip around the Persian Gulf.  The long lens is perfect for discreet portraits, and the GPS was invaluable in helping to place the images in the proper geographic location when writing up my travel notes.  I'm using iPhoto as my photo editor and a combination of this camera and good editing software renders stunning images.", "Date": "January 20, 2014"}, {"Title": "Just what I was looking for!", "Author": "Jan", "ReviewID": "R1OIC8IKS19GCD", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I am new to photography as a hobby and have been using a point and shoot Coolpix P4 for several years just when I wanted to shoot photos while on vacation.  I love to hike and often wished while on the trail that I had a zoom lens on my camera capable of capturing some of the wildlife in the distance.  Prior to the holiday season I ordered this camera kit after reading reviews comparing this camera to the Canon SX model.  I have neck issues that prevent me from carrying heavy articles and wanted to avoid the DSLR category due to the weight of the various lens.  I have seen folks on the trail loaded down with so much equipment that I can't imagine myself enjoying a hike or being able to complete one with that much equipment attached to my body.  This kit arrived quickly and in good shape as far as packaging.  The bag that comes with it is compact but carries what I will need on the trail and is lightweight, has not been an issue with my neck.  I am still learning the capabilities of this camera but so far love it.  I made a video for my nieces in FL yesterday of the snowstorm we were having as they wanted to see the snowflakes coming down.  I sent the video to my sister who is a graphic artist and has worked with various cameras over the years and she was amazed at the quality and clearness of the video I sent.  I chose this camera over the Canon as I am used to the menu of the Nikon brand and thought that it would be an easy transition for me.  Also liked the appearance of the area for holding the camera which has proven to be a great fit for my medium sized hands.  Also because the LCD screen was slightly larger on the Nikon which is what I will use 95% of the time.  The tripod that comes with the camera is a table tripod.  I have since ordered a Sirui P-326 carbon monopod (based on my sisters recommendations) and I love it as it is light as a feather and collapses to about 12 inches.  Will make a great walking stick too.  Back to the camera, so many options that I am still experimenting with.  I live rural and love shooting old barns and have it set up to shoot black and white and sepia along with regular shots.  The zoom on this is amazing as I don't always want to go on private property for shooting old barns and can shoot from a distance with beautiful results.  All in all, for my needs, this camera is excellent and light weight for my physical limitations. I have always been impressed with my little Nikon P4 and this camera was within my budget as a retiree and the Nikon brand continues to impress.", "Date": "January 7, 2014"}, {"Title": "Best Christmas gift ever!", "Author": "Rosanna Gonsiewski", "ReviewID": "R2J5B4V5VO0R0R", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "My daughter loves it!
