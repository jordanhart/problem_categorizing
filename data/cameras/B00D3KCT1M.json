I bought this camera for the birth of my first child and to have for her childhood years, I would of paid more for this item if i had to of! The battery last long enough in my opinion and the video is to die for. Being able to transfer photos to a smart device real time is a wonderful feature, Upload to Facebook or YouTube strut from the camera is also a great feature. Two thumbs up for me and my family! Yet another great product from Samsung", "Date": "September 15, 2013"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": null, "Features": null, "Name": null, "ImgURL": null, "ProductID": "B00D3KCT1M"}}
