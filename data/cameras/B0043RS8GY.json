{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Great for any environment", "Author": "macsareback", "ReviewID": "R12P33P2L2HS3E", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This camera is primarily aimed at industries and companies who need photos fast. I have to say that you can still use this as a creative tool just without the RAW built into it. It will handle pretty much anything thrown at it, and it's the only compact out there with a lens that kills any rivals out there with the way it's made. It's a top notch lens, and the camera may be pricey...but it will never break on you from a drop or from rainy days. You can literally take this thing anywhere and shoot in any condition, plus this company updates their firmwares often and has pretty good customer service I've been reading. I haven't had to deal with them yet, so this is a good sign.", "Date": "December 23, 2010"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": "Unavailable", "Features": "Model: G700SE", "Name": "Ricoh G700SE Digital Camera with Bluetooth and Wireless LAN Support", "ImgURL": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/21XG%2Bwt2RhL.jpg", "ProductID": "B0043RS8GY"}}
