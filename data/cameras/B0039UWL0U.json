So far I haven't used too many of the settings, but the pictures I've taken have come out fantastic.  I took it to Epcot for the Flower and Garden festival this spring and the pictures are amazing and I can totally see the difference from pictures taken last year with my point and shoot.  I also have a new baby boy and I love the photos I can take of him.  You can take multiple pictures in quick succession which is important with a little one.  The vendor I purchased this from thru Amazon was also very helpful when I emailed and called with questions on how to attach extra lenses, etc.  You can also purchase instructional DVDs on Amazon (a beginner level and advanced level) to help you learn how to use it.  My husband just got those for me and I look forward to learning more about my camera.", "Date": "April 2, 2011"}, {"Title": "Incomplete", "Author": "Lorena", "ReviewID": "R1O01ORCBT8AIB", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "This kit doesn't include the lens.
