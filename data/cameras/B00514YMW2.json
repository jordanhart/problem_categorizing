{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Great system", "Author": "CJ \"area526\"", "ReviewID": "RG2B3VU4095X8", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I have the 8ch system, but same setup. It's a really great DVR & takes up very lil room. The company GW Security is a pretty good co. & respond to emails pretty quick. I've has several problems in learning how to do some advanced set ups & the company has been very helpful.Instead of me listing all the pros of this unit, just read the specs sheet real careful....it a truly professional setup. I had this system for quite awhile now & honestly....I cannot think of a single Con about it. My only problem is I should've got the 16ch instead. Think about that when your purchasing. How many cameras will you need in 6-9 months. The system was so good, I ended up putting up cameras everywhere. Even at the pool so I can watch the Creepy cleaner in the pool....make sure it doesn't get hung-up. I highly recommend this system ....when you buy one, go one size bigger if you can. You won't regret the decision to spend the extra money.I've had surveillance systems since 1984 & this is the best I've ever had.", "Date": "July 26, 2013"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": null, "Features": null, "Name": null, "ImgURL": null, "ProductID": "B00514YMW2"}}
