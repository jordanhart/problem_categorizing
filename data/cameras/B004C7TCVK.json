It shipped out and arrived quickly, but when we opened it, the driver CD had a hole punched through the top, and I was NOT about to put that in my DVD drive, so I really have no idea whether it works or not.Also, this camera does NOT have a memory slot for extra memory. I don't know why Amazon would let this company get away with advertising so falsely, but there ya go!There is no way of contacting the company directly. You can just contact Amazon to negotiate a refund or exchange.Cheap camera, cheap product....buyer beware!", "Date": "June 23, 2013"}, {"Title": "unfortunate!", "Author": "Deborah A Summers", "ReviewID": "R3JFSP0DDDOPDJ", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "HUGE disappointment! My child said \"why would Santa's elves build something that doesnt even work\"?  I had told her maybe they got too busy and a little sloppy while putting it together.  She was heartbroken and very disapponted w/ Santa's elves.  Summary:  It was built cheap, cheesy and difficult for a child to use on their own w/out adult supervision.  I would love my money back however I don't have the time nor patience to send it back....SO, it's in her closet in a box and will probably NEVER be used again.  Again, disappointing.  Thank you and sorry for the poor review; who knows, maybe someone else had a better experience!", "Date": "January 14, 2014"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": null, "Features": null, "Name": null, "ImgURL": null, "ProductID": "B004C7TCVK"}}
