{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Another Great Kodak Camera", "Author": "Alexis J.", "ReviewID": "R3P7CYC3SD7E1L", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I have only had the camera for a couple of days and I'm already very pleased with it.  Takes wonderful pictures right out of the box in the Auto mode,  but there are many different features that I will have to play around with.  The 12x zoom is perfect for catching objects from a distance and the Image Stabilizer works wonders.  I have tried to shake the camer while taking the picture and it has still came out great.A few things to know before buying: The camera does not have an electronic viewfinder, so sometimes in direct light(sun)it may be hard to view the LCD screen.  It also uses 3 different types of batteries KLIC-8000 (rechargeable Li Ion), CRV3 (Non rechargeable Li Ion), and it also takes 2 AA litium Ion batteries.  If you buy the KLIC-8000 battery you have to purchase a separate charger, you cannot charge the battery in the camera.  If you are looking for a big zoom camera that will fit in your pocket this is not the camera for you.", "Date": "June 24, 2008"}, {"Title": "Pleasantly Surprised", "Author": "T. BOND", "ReviewID": "R39WTT2XKPP6XR", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I orginally wrote this review after using the camera for only a few hours because I found that I liked it a lot.  Several weeks later I still stand by the review.  They've tried to pack as much basic camera into as few dollars as possible and IMHO they've done a good job. They've also included enough old-school professional grade features to let someone who understands f-stops, shutter speeds and depth-of-field to play with that a little.Megapixels don't mean much anymore without the glass to support a good image and the glass on this one seems pretty good (Schneider-KRUEZNACH). The glass doesn't fill up the whole width of the lens barrel you see in the picture.  Some of that width is probably for the optics of the zoom and possibly appearance.  There's more and better glass however, than your typical point-and-shoot.  I'm surprised how clear a picture I can get with 8.1 mega pixels.  I just blew my best picture up on a 46 inch 1080p big screen TV and, even at this size, I can zoom in quite a bit before it breaks down.  For me it's worth having a boxy shape that won't fit in my pocket to get a good zoom and good glass.  The zoom is surprisingly variable too.  It doesn't confine you to half-dozen or so preset stages, so you can frame the image as you'd like.  Without preset stages, however, it wants to refocus each time you change the zoom, so it's not a continuous image and you have to be willing to put up with a moment of blur.The focusing system itself is great.  It works on some kind of grid system and it decides which part of the picture is relevant, outlines the parts of the grid it's using to focus and sets the lens.  I love it!  It does a pretty good job of picking the relevant detail, and you can aim it elsewhere and hold down the button if you want to tell it to focus on something else.If you like pushing the limits of what can be done with ambient light, this camera is better than a typical pocket point and shoot.  (Due to the extra glass)  Even in a dark living room lit by a 60-watt incadescent light bulb and two north windows, I was able to get a super dense/detailed picture of my kid, which I'm very happy with, using no flash.  (The camera picked a 1/40 shutter speed.)  In the same room, with no light on, I zoomed in on my dog from 9 feet away and the camera took an awfully good picture at 1/6 of a sec.  Again, I was leaning against something, but -- at a sixth -- the image stabilization had to be working overtime to preserve the sharpness it did.  Zooming in all the way, showed it wasn't quite as sharp as my second picture with a flash, but it was easily good enough to blow-up on 1080p TV.  And it was better, of course, because it didn't have that \"flat\" look that comes with using a flash.  For a camera under $700 I thought it did extremely well with low light  ... and I suppose one could always use the flash.One aspect of photography is the fleeting nature of any image you might try to capture.  At this price I can't get a rapid refresh between pictures, but what I did get with the Z8612 is a camera that captures the image immediately - the image or facial expression I actually saw - without the digital pause.  I've not found this before in consumer-grade digital cameras and for me that was really important.  Some have objected to the automatic lens cap release, but I really like the \"ready to shoot\" concept in that design.  You hit the power button and \"bing\" the lens cap pops off, the lens shoots forward and the flash (if you want it) is ready to go.Some reviews have commented the battery that shipped with the camera didn't last long at all, and I found that to be the case as well.  The AA lithiums I replaced it with have lasted fairly well and it took a while to go through the first pair.  I may upgrade to the official rechargeable unit, but these are pretty cheap.I only bought this camera because I lost a Samsung 10 mpix NV11 but I'm glad I did.  That was a nice (more expensive) consumer camera, with good reviews, and the array of buttons was neat, but the Kodak just seems to be designed better.  The wider glass handles low light better; the images are as good or better even though it has fewer pixels, the image is truer to what I saw because the electronic delay kicks in AFTER the camera captures the shot, the zoom is more versatile and more powerful - again better glass - it's easier to learn, the color handling is good, the focus is more responsive and informative, and I can load images on my computer without installing any software.  With the Kodak, I also get the sense of something designed by camera people and, for me, that difference has turned out to mean a lot.  For instance, there are fewer buttons yet I can easily dial the EV (darkness/lightness bias) up or down a few stops in the midst of shooting, which is great.It's kind of a gimick I guess, but they throw in a camera mode that intelligently stitches together several pictures into one panoramic view. I've not had that before and I was kind of \"blown away\" at first.  With your help, it seems to sense how to line up appropriate edges when it can.  You have to admire the software team that pulled that off.Note that this camera does NOT have a range finder (i.e. a look-through port at the top of the camera).  For me the design and lens quality took the sting out of that, but if that doesn't work for you, you may want to look at the Kodak Z1015 IS for an extra $90.  I haven't tried that camera.This is, by no means, the $1,200 EOS SLR I'm currently drooling over but, for me, it captures enough of the SLR experience to ease those cravings for now.  Carrying this simple, boxy-looking camera around is an exercise in humility but, on the other hand, it doesn't shout \"steal me\" when you set it down somewhere.  It does seem to capture enough of the things a photographer needs that I don't feel like I have to sacrifice something to go from film to digital even though I'm buying a budget camera.  At the time I bought it, retailers were dropping like flies and the camera was going for something over $150 and I felt very fortunate to get this much camera for the price I paid, as I still do today.  Apparently others agree as the demand has grown and the price has risen quite a bit.", "Date": "February 16, 2009"}, {"Title": "Read this review to find solutions to the \"issues\"", "Author": "Bejoy George", "ReviewID": "R1EUBYIK05PFAR", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I own this camera. Bought it after enough research.About the \"issues\":1) Lens cap falling off - The lens cap falls off only when you turn the camera on. Not sure why this is perceived as a big issue if you use the lanyard to attach it to the body of the cam. It is like the cam saying \"I am ready for it !\" :-). When you turn it off, close the lens with the cap and it stays intact. The only annoyance is that when you want to see the snaps on your cam, but don't want to take any snap for the time being, the lens can't have the cap on since it will fall off when you turn the cam on. But do you think that when you view the snaps on the lcd of your cam the lens can get damaged because the cap is not on ? I don't. This is a non-issue to me.2) Lens popping up - This is an annoyance, but the easy work around would be to keep a finger on the flash when you turn the cam on. Thats it !3) Battery getting drained quick - Three types of batteries can be used on this cam which are recommended by Kodak- AA sized Lithium batteries, CRV-3 batteries and the Klic-8000 batteries. I bought \"2 NEW Lithium-Ion BATTERY & CHARGER For KODAK CR-V3 CRV3 C743 / DX4530 / DX6330 / DX6340\" from amazon. You can use the link http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00153RFUY to see this product. Got 2 rechargeable CRV-3 type batteries and a charger for less than $14 which includes shipping. These batteries do work and lasts for plenty of snaps.4) Slowness - Turn review/Quickview off and you can take 4 snaps in 10 seconds. If you are one who takes more than 4 snaps in 10 seconds, a $100 cam is not what you should be looking for.5) Use manual is not detailed - Download the extended user guide from Kodak website. You can use the link [...] to get the extended user guide.The lens is great. Image stabilization works very well. The camera feels solid in your hand. The cam offers 12x zoom, PASM modes, a bunch of scene selections, panorama mode, takes excellent snaps and has great low light capabilities. The buttons are laid out pretty well and neat too. If you are looking for a cam which takes excellent snaps, has good zoom, your budget is less than $150-$170 [You can get one for less than $109 including shipping] and you don't care about the size and looks of the cam, then this is the one ! If you are ok with 3x-4x zoom and want a compact cam which takes great snaps and offer PASM modes and other features, looks good and should be within $150-$170 go for Canon A590 [You get it for less than $114 including shipping. I bought one for $98 a couple of months back. Now the prices have been raised probably because of the rising demand]. Download the Canon firmware hack and get it loaded on your A590 and that makes it a super cam, though with only 4x zoom. I own both z8612 and A590. z8612 takes snaps which are far colourful and rich than A590.", "Date": "April 11, 2009"}, {"Title": "Do not buy this camera!", "Author": "Keith \"Keith\"", "ReviewID": "R11BFGPX9TTE0F", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I made the mistake of buying this camera sight unseen and without reading the reviews.First, the good:  takes wonderful pictures.  I had an olympus 3.2mp 10x optical zoom camera.  this one beats it in all modes I've tried including the super macro setting for ultra close ups.Having said that, the engineers who designed this screwed the pooch so badly they need to be shot, hung, drawn and quartered, and their heads put on a pike.  Same goes for the marketing morons who specified this product.It takes 2 AA batteries.  It eats them.  Nope, rechargeable Nimh won't work.  Not even the high capacity ones; too much power draw.  You MUST use the lithium ion ones.  Yeah, the $2 each AA lithium battery.  Stupid engineers.The reason it eats them is the large LCD display on the back is the ONLY way to take a picture; there is no viewfinder.  Stupid marketing people.  The LCD washes out easily if you're taking a picture in sunlight.Second, the delay time to store the picture is ridiculous.  I've tried faster SD cards to no avail.  If you want to take more than 3 pictures within 10 seconds (count to 10; it's a long time...), this is not your camera.And the lens cap always comes off.  WTF?? I've owned a number of cameras; expensive, cheap, and moderate, and never been so disgusted with their inability to execute on this simple thing.  It's like they put their worst guys on this camera.  Really, how hard is it to make a camera with a lens cap that stays on?  If Boeing designed things this poorly, planes wouldn't even be getting off the ground.  The lens is one of the most important parts of the camera and it's at high risk of getting scratched with no lens cap..  Stupid engineers.There are other issues with this camera, but those are the biggies.Don't buy this camera.  There are other cameras out there where you don't have to make the tradeoffs this one requires of you.", "Date": "November 25, 2008"}, {"Title": "Great buy for the price", "Author": "Robert I.

For the price, these features are usually unheard of.  The camera shot super clear pictures zoomed completely out or completely in.  Rapid-fire shooting rate captures clear images, even when moving fast ( I was rotating in circles to test this out, if you've ever been shopping with me I test every camera I buy completely).  My only qualm was that it is built like a traditional 35mm camera, meaning that anyone wanting to stash it in their jeans pocket for stealth shooting may be out of luck.  But since I work from my car, this will not be a problem.

It's pretty intuitive to use. It's easy to delete unwanted pics on the fly. I bought this as a replacement for a Sony. Take good pics easily. True, it does take Li-Ion batteries, as do most higher quality cameras (look around a little) The rechargeable Li-Ion battery lasts a lot longer and has more voltage. I picked up a charger on Amazon, including the battery for about $30.00. So for around $200 total, a very decent set up. Save time for photos to SD card is decent. Again probably thanks to Li-Ion. Good manual settings too. It seems like a good camera for someone who may want to use in auto or do a little experimenting with manual controls as well.

Would Pay $200!!!!!!", "Author": "Gregory Davidson \"11415\"", "ReviewID": "R1JXQP7T7X0QN4", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "For the price I paid for this camera, I was expecting the same old average digital camera that I usually buy. After taking just a few photos, I realized that this camera was far better than any other camera I've ever purchased for the price!! In fact, the Z8612IS completely wipes out a camera I had purchased in the past for over $200!! The pictures are crisp and clear, and you don't even have to play around with the settings to take a really good photo. Most of the pictures I take are in \"Auto\" mode which doesn't work that well on some cameras. But on this camera, it works like a charm!! This camera is also \"user-friendly\" and isn't that hard for the average person to understand how to use it. Anybody who says otherwise must be a complete newbie when it comes to digital cameras. The only thing I didn't like about this camera is that it doesn't take regular AA batteries. However, lithium ion batteries last much much longer so even if it did take AA batteries, lithium ions would be the better choice. For the price of this camera, you really can't beat it!! I'm surprised this camera isn't selling for the retail price of $200 because that's what it's really worth.

The quality of pictures are superb.After I read the instructions,I experiment to take pictures at work,inside and outside the house,the flowers and plants we have around came out perfect.I made some mistakes of taking pictures because I forgot to change settings on the mode dial.But most of my shooting came out nice.Also,it takes about 3 sec.in-between takes.Second con,it takes about 8 to 10 secs. to light the 2.5\" LCD.  It has a cover for the lens,the glass itself look like an SLR professional camera.Yet it's true that it is not a pocket camera.I bought 4gb sd and will take over one thousands pictures, one hour of video, which I haven't try it yet.It comes with the strap and a battery,you have to buy your own charger. Oh, the battery last longer than expected, over a week. Well, that's when your not taking pictures a lot.I still have to get familiarized with the features,after all I just have this last 17th,aug08. I love the color a black surface.As other recommended for potential buyers,check it personally,try to feel in your hand if it is comfortable or too big for your fingers to press tiny bottons.Like Ii said if you want a pocket camera this one is not for you.By the way the lens is not retractable, permanently protrude.  I am writing this review after 32 months I bought it. Now I am changing my attributes for durability and performance.I say to some negatives about it.The flashstop working,all the features on the Dial mode not showing anymore.Still takes good pictures outdoors and of coarse bad quality images indoors,sucks.The rubber felton the hundle peeled off, so I glued back in.It could be just my camera, and others may stil in good conditions.", "Date": "August 28, 2008"}, {"Title": "Kodak short comings", "Author": "Lorrie R.

(The old camera had a fatal incident involving a sidewalk a few weeks ago.) I was very surprised with the quality of the pictures I have taken with this camera. Pleased enough to take a little time to write up a review.First the pics off this camera are terrific. The lens is wonderful. I would consider this a great lens at any price, and certainly unusual to find a lens of this quality on a camera in this price range.Initial start up and ready to shoot time is very good. Recycle time between pics is adequate at 8MP and very good at 5MP.  The time between pressing the shutter and the image capture is very fast.The controls are simple. The camera is light weight and easy to hold and shoot with one hand. (If you are right handed.) In fact the camera is so lightweight that at first I worried about durability. I don't worry so much now. It has already survived one drop to the floor with no problems so evidently it is sturdier than it feels.The pre-programed modes are easy to adjust. Not a lot of menus to toggle through. I believe you will find yourself shooting on auto most of the time. I have found that works fine for just about everything.The flash is adequate for most family snapshots. What is even better is the low light capability. There is a high ISO mode that also works quite well.There is no viewfinder but the display is bright and relatively easy to see even in daylight. The brightness is adjustable but you have to navigate the menu system to change the display brightness.Speaking of battery life, it is actually very good. The camera will not work with conventional alkaline batteries so good battery life is a good thing. The CRV3 battery is lasting much longer than batteries on my other digital cameras so I can't complain too much. (CRV3 batteries are not available everywhere so keep an extra in your bag, or get rechargeable ones.)The zoom works very well. Very smooth and allows stopping at any point.  And with 12x optical zoom capability there is really no need for a bag full of lenses.The image stabilization works great.  Great for use in a moving car.When you turn the camera on, the lens cap automatically pops off. (So use the cord to attach it to the camera body.) The flash always pops up as well. Even if it isn't needed. It does not flash if not needed but it is always up and ready in case you move into a low light situation.The camera looks are kind of plain. Nothing flashy about it at all. Still it works just fine.So overall I have to say this is a great camera. Especially in this price range. You can find remarkable deals on line for this 8MP model. I do miss the viewfinder. (I still find myself putting the camera to my eye to take a picture. 50 years of looking through viewfinders is a hard habit to break.) But this system works very well and the resulting photos are great, which is the whole point isn't it?I have not used the video much.  But it seems easy enough to use and has pretty good quality from a still camera.Over all this is a great digital camera. A really great lens and lots of features for very little money.", "Date": "March 2, 2009"}, {"Title": "no view finder but wow!", "Author": "Don Schneider", "ReviewID": "R1CFTMGGOQ1TX7", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Couldn't be happier.

The mic they used in this camera makes the video feature unacceptable. Anything louder than a whisper causes a painful crackling on video playback (on camera and after transfer to computer). This model should be recalled for this reason.  Kodak support is very unhelpful; it has been sent in for repair under warranty two times, and Kodak won't admit there is an issue with the audio.  I have had two other digital cameras with video capability that were inferior cameras, but had MUCH better sound than this camera. Kodak will not replace the camera with a different model or give me my money back. I have not had trouble with this camera eating batteries as in other reviews.

I took pictures in ISO setting from about 100yds away at a concert and they came out clear.3) Lightweight and portable.4) The image stabilization works wonderfully. Out of 400 pictures I took while out of town only about two turned out blurry.5) Flash can easily be pushed down and then reopened with a button.Personal Shortcomings:1) The indoor pictures can sometimes be dark, even with the flash. I didn't have this problem with my old camera. My boyfriend says his older model Easyshare is the same way. Switching to the ISO setting helps a lot unless you are close to the object, then it can sometimes come out too bright. I haven't got this part quite figured out.2) It takes videos in .mov format, which I have to convert before I can edit on Windows Movie Maker or even play.3) It is a bit slower than I am used to... Especially if you try to switch from Still to Video (make sure not to switch the way that takes you through the panoramic setting, or else you will be waiting for a full minute while it catches up).Overall this is a great camera for the price, I am just a little picky about the things I want. Some people may not be as picky as me. lolOh, and let me mention that I bought mine refurbished and it really is like new. :) It came with all the accessories and manual.

Of course, my wife has had several portable pocket style cameras, but this is the first DSLR camera either of us have owned. First, we both have been absolutely astonished by the quality of photos this camera produces. I would estimate that 90% of our photos with this camera are taken with in \"Auto\" mode because neither our are even close to being professional photographers. In fact, both my brother and mother have asked me to take pictures of special events because of the great quality of the pictures.Several reviewers have had concerns on battery life, but I haven't had any problems of the sort.  I bought rechargable batteries off of ebay for very cheap, which came with two batteries and have never had to use more then one in any picture session.  This should not be a concern or deal breaker as many current DSLR style digital cameras tend to go through batteries.The camera has been very easy to use for someone that is on their first digital camera.  It is very easy to come away with a quality pictures and change from one setting to another.  I have barely read through the manual and don't have any problems getting to where I want on this camera.  Unless you are a professional photographer, I don't see how anyone could be upset with the picture quality of this product....remember Kodak invited digitial imagining.Overall this is a great product that will get you the results you want.  Just keep in mind this camera is not a $500 DSLR, but you do get more then what you paid ($100-$200) for in this instance.  I would also note that there is no view finder for those of you who are used to one.  Again, this camera does the job.  If your in the market for a digital camera, I would definitely suggest giving this product a hard look. You can't go wrong with 8MP & 12x optical zoom in this price range.  The easyshare photo software is just a added bonus with all the things you can do to the photos. My wife is now using the zd8612is exclusively so I'm upgrading.

As a high-school student in a photography class, this camera is an excellent choice in comparison to the pricier $500+ DSLR cameras. It gives you the same manual features that DSLRs have, and allows you to have more \"creative control\" over your pictures then a regular point and shoot camera does. You can adjust shutter speed, aperture, depth of field, etc... Things you can't do with a normal camera. This, combined with the 12x zoom make it a great camera for a beginning to intermediate photographer who is in a photography class.

You can still get great photos from it.)On that same note, this camera only saves images in .jpeg. This is good because it is a versatile file format, but it compresses the images and they often don't come out as sharp as they would if they were saved in a RAW, un-compressed image format (the format most professional photographers use). This is expected from a point-and-shoot, especially at this price, but it's just something to note for those who understand file formats and photography.It does have auto features for those who aren't skilled at photography and just want a camera that \"works\". It is a bit bulky, but not ridiculously huge, and it can easily fit in the pocket of a hoodie or a hooded sweatshirt. It probably won't fit in your jeans pocket though, so consider buying a small camera bag.I can't say much about battery life yet-- I just bought it a few hours ago. So far, the battery life's been good. It came charged out of the box, and I've been fiddling around with it for a little while and it hasn't showed any signs of dying. I expect this would change if you were taking pictures for an extended period of time (say an hour or more) being as it's LCD screen is on all the time (because it doesn't come with a viewfinder-- something that a photography student might not like at first, but they can easily adjust to live view). It comes with one lithium battery-- a Kodak CRV3-- that can be easily confused with a rechargeable battery at first glance. After looking more closely, I discovered it was indeed, not a rechargeable battery. There are rechargeable batteries out there for this camera from Kodak and some other brands (best bet would be to buy from Kodak). It also takes AA Lithium batteries (which is nice when/if you forget to charge your rechargeable batteries and you're out of town and you forgot to bring the battery charger and your camera only takes that specific rechargeable battery) which can be a bit pricey, but they often have a longer life then alkaline batteries. (The manual for this camera states that it does not use alkaline batteries.)It also does video. I've toyed around with it a little bit, and it seems to work well. Nice high-def picture. It works much better then my $60 video camera that I got a few years ago, and it has a much better picture. Keep in mind that you might have some sound issues though, being as it's primarily a still image camera rather then a video camera. The mic on it is OK, but don't expect to hear someone across the room if they're whispering.So if you can handle a little bit bulkier camera (reasonably bulky-- it's smaller then a dslr and slightly bigger then most average-sized point and shoots) with more features, better zoom, and no viewfinder (something that can be easily forgotten about and something you probably won't miss), then you will like this camera. For the price, you can't go wrong. Similar cameras sell for a much higher price and have similar zoom ranges, but less manual features that amateur photographers like.", "Date": "December 6, 2009"}, {"Title": "Had this for over a year and it's fantastic!!", "Author": "A.

I have a Fuji 9600 which takes beautiful pictures and is next to a professional camera in capabilities.  However the Fuji, my Canon 720IS, my Samsung S1050, and my wife's Canon A95, although they do focus occasionally in low light, all refuse to focus dependably in low light.  They all take great pictures other wise.  I have read that Canon is supposed to be the low light digicam king.  I strongly disagree with this assessment.  Kodak wins with the z8612.The Kodak z8612 surpasses my expectations when it comes to quality.  It takes beautiful, focused pictures in near dark conditions, like in a mall parking lot at night.  Even attempting to take low light pictures, while the z8612 is hand held, the results are usually well focused pictures.The biggest surprise came when I was comparing the Kodak to the Fuji while taking pictures of houses about \u00bc mile away at  normal megapixel settings.  Amazingly, even when the Kodak z8612 was set at 6 megapixels, the detail and clarity surpasses the Fuji with noticeably better quality, detail and clarity when both cameras are set at maximum zoom.  Even when the Fuji is set at 9 megapixels, and the z8612 is set at either 8 megapixels or even 6 megapixels, the z8612 stomps the Fuji in picture quality, and at less than half the price.I definitely recommend this camera. It is one of those sleepers that often go unnoticed.", "Date": "April 15, 2009"}, {"Title": "Unbelievable value.", "Author": "Aswell Cohen \"theleetbeagle\"", "ReviewID": "R1VBXFYUJSJ92B", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "First off, let me state that I bought this for $108 brand new with a 4GB SDHC card off of eBay. I also received $15 cashback via the Microsoft/eBay cashback program.So essentially I bought this wonderful camera for well under $100.I am by no means a pro photographer. You couldn't even call me a novice or amateur. I just like snapping pictures, despite if they come out well or otherwise.I've wanted a superzoom for wildlife and surveillance use. I purchased this camera due to the positive reviews and the price.I read several reviews from semi-pro photographers on the web. They were extremely critical of their sample photographs, but to me they look wonderful.I've come from a Canon 3.0 compact camera so this is a great difference.The good:Many people say the camera feels cheap and plastic-ey. I disagree with this. It feels solid and comfortable in my hands. It is a simple camera, yet has all the features I will ever need. Amongst those is the ability to add additional wide angle or zoom lenses as necessary. The zoom works great. The LCD is huge compared to my old SD100.I love the curved design on the right side where the battery goes. It's a great handhold and efficiently used.Choices of three battery types, but only comes with a non-rechargeable. KLIC-8000's (rechargeables) are all over eBay.The bad:The manual, although not useless, does not go into great detail. My SD100 manual practically taught you how to be an amateur photographer.The SHARE button is too conspicuously placed by your RH thumb. Who uses the Kodak software anyhow? Any normal user will pull the SD card and transfer photos that way. I'm going to be accidentally hitting this useless key nonstop.The lens cover seems flimsy. I already turned the camera on with the cover on and the lense popped the cover off when it auto-extends. Did this twice and I thought it was kind of cool. The third time though it was latched too tightly and ground the motor. Didn't like that, but appears to be no damage.The flash pops up every time you turn the camera on. For shots that need to remain very quiet, this makes a loud audible click. The fix is to simply hold your finger on the flash when turning the camera on and releasing it slowly with your finger. But it should pop up as needed, not every time.The flash itself is on a very complicated hinge that is difficult to close. I bet this is the first thing that breaks. Getting a SqureTrade warranty for this reason and bc I have a 20% coupon.The four-way navigation key is too flush with the body. Should be raised up a little for easier use.Wait time between shots appears to be a little long, but for what I use the camera for it won't be an issue. Read/Writes on a 8MP file will cause that, though.Conclusion:My bad points should not turn you away from this camera. If you want a 12x superzoom with the ability to throw a 3x add-on lense on top of that, and you want to spend no more than $110, get this camera.", "Date": "April 3, 2009"}, {"Title": "Great Camera", "Author": "Readouts \"Readouts\"", "ReviewID": "R3IMLGDY8HS867", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This is a great camera, especially for the price.

It's got some nice features (more than I'll probably ever use, I'm no expert), the zoom and optical zoom are superb, and the picture quality is nice.There's only one problem I've had with the camera, although the problem may not be with the camera itself.  At some point I must have turned it on unknowingly because I went to use it and the battery it came with was completely dead.  I hadn't used it much so I would hate to think this battery was that crappy (plus there was no warning that I saw that it was getting weak the last time I used it, about a week prior).  Unless they shipped me an old battery with it I'm just not sure what happened.If I HAD somehow turned/left it on then I would think they would have some sort of automatic shutoff after a period of time of no use.  Either way it was either the lack of this feature or the lousy battery they sent me that keeps me from giving this 5 stars.  To me this is a minor beef, I wish they had the option to give half stars.Luckily I had some AA batteries handy and they did the trick, and they've last far longer than the batteries that came with it.  I use the camera sparingly for now so I haven't had a chance to really test battery life.  I would imagine AAs won't last long if I'm walking around New York and taking pictures and/or video so eventually I'll have to get some sort of spare of higher quality.So yes I'm glad I bought it, I would recommend it to anyone, just keep an eye on the battery and have some sort of spare handy.", "Date": "April 18, 2009"}, {"Title": "best camera I've ever owned", "Author": "JJ Stark", "ReviewID": "R28YWTE3WE0O1I", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This is by far the best camera I've ever owned.  Takes absolutely fantastic pics -- crystal clear and spot-on perfect color.  It's also so easy to use.  The video feature is also great, esp when it's not a designated \"video camera\".  Depending on the size of your memory card, you can capture up to an hour of video (w/sound) on this camera.  While I haven't mastered all of its settings and full usage yet, I can say it takes perfect pics right out of the box -- point & shoot and you're all ready.  Even the most amateurs can use this camera with ease!  But if you're a pro and like to use more advanced features, there are many to choose from here. I've also noticed not a single red eye when taking pic with the flash (something that was a MAJOR problem with my last camera).  The pics I've taken with this camera have needed no adjustments whatsoever (I was constantly adjusting the brightness, color and red eye reduction with nearly every pic I took with my last camera)My only complaint would be the length of time between pics when using the flash.  It takes about 3-5 secs for the flash to ready itself.  Otherwise, I'm very pleased with this camera.  The battery life is also fantastic.  With almost daily use, a battery easily lasts 3-4 weeks!!

If I was in the shade, taking photos with the screen was fine, but in bright sunlight I couldn't see the screen well enough to take good photos.The other negative to the camera was that even though it was supposed to have a 12X zoom - and it did - the pictures often turned out very fuzzy, even when the item being photographed was not moving.The camera was very light, which tended to give me the feeling it wasn't a 'real' camera.  I had a Kodak Z710 before and am used to their cameras having more substance to them.  I loved the Z710 and wouldn't have had to get a new camera if I hadn't dropped it and it quit working.Overall it was a disappointment to me and I returned it to purchase a different Kodak EasyShare camera.  I purchased the Kodak Z1015 IS, which I am very pleased with.", "Date": "March 9, 2009"}, {"Title": "Great", "Author": "KJW", "ReviewID": "R2X4Y31QMA6WB", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I have always loved taking pictures, this is the easiest camera.

When we tried to take it back Walmart said it was one day past the cut off and that I needed to return it to Kodak to get it fixed.  Well instead of giving me a new camera, they gave me a refurb (great!!).  I shipped it off the first week in January and waited 4 weeks and the refurb is broken right out of the box.Now I have waited on hold for at least an hour on 2 different occasions trying to get this camera shipped back and the customer service is out of the Philippines, so sometimes there is a language issue, but I don't blame them, its bad manufacturer quality.Now I have to ship the refurb back and wait again, I hope the 3rd time is a charm!!STAY AWAY FROM THIS CAMERA!!!!", "Date": "February 3, 2009"}, {"Title": "Great!!!", "Author": "Daniel Carrasco Jr. \"AggieDan\"", "ReviewID": "R1A11TC2J9F953", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Camera is a great buy for the price.
