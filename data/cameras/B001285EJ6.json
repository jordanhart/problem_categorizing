For me, this is a secondary camera (used when my wife and I travel separately), and it performs very well for that purpose.Pros- Lightweight- Plenty of shooting options- Price- Built-in battery (no hassles with AA batteries, etc. like other cameras in this price range)- Battery lifetimeCons- The shoot mode dial on top changes easily when the camera is in a pocket. You need to make sure that it didn't change (or you'll start recording a video when you really wanted a picture, etc.)- Closeups are a bit blurry, even when using the built-in mode for that.- Flash takes a while to charge- No standard USB connector - you have to travel with the supplied cable to sync and charge.", "Date": "September 14, 2008"}, {"Title": "Samsung L100 digital camera", "Author": "M.

I asked him to find one that was simple to use, reasonably priced, and took good photos and this one more than filled the bill.  I love dealing with Amazon and have always been happy with purchases made through them. My daughter enjoys using it and the pictures are great.  It can even take movies and uses rechargable batteries, a real plus since disposable batteries can be expensive. We would definitely recommend it.", "Date": "November 11, 2008"}, {"Title": "A $100 Technical Masterpiece", "Author": "Smokey Joe \"S&J;\"", "ReviewID": "RR69XHW6LSYIU", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Having owned a few Nikon digital SLR's and point and shoots, I was drawn to this camera by its cool looks at first. With its ability to shoot fully manual, adjust white balance, two hours of moving video, and numerous other desirable features including a tripod socket, how can you go wrong for this price? Samsung knows how to pack alot of bang for the buck into a small, attractive and effective package. I hope to break it in soon.", "Date": "September 12, 2008"}, {"Title": "**** Better than Expected.

Over the years, I've owned many cameras from Canon, Nikon, Sony, etc. And after reading numerous reviews, what attracted me to this camera was the ease of use, the girly color, and the price. It turned out to be a good choice. And my grandniece loves it. She was able to figure out how to use it on her own in no time.The camera is very easy to use, it took very good to excellent pictures in a variety of lighting conditions, it records video, it's small enough to fit in a shirt pocket, has rechargeable battery that last for many, many pictures even with flash. In addition, it has the expansion slot for SD card, so you can take any number of photos depending on the SD card.Overall, this is a very good everyday use camera and a very reasonable price.", "Date": "March 1, 2010"}, {"Title": "Very Nice", "Author": "C.

This is a very, very easy camera to use, and the picture quality is fantastic.  The best part is you don't have to spend an arm and a leg for it.

Excellent pictures although I find my self adjusting the shadows some to bring up the darker parts, but good color results. Great battery life. I wish it had flash fill. It is also a little weak on saturation. Colors are not as brilliant as they could be.But the low point appears to be the lens mechanism. It reached a point where it would sometimes not make it all the way out, going back in with a beep, beep, beep. then it became constant, needing a little help to pull it out. Now even if you coax it out it won't focus.I did get a few thousand good pictures out of it.I ordered a Canon PowerShot A3000IS to replace it.", "Date": "June 12, 2011"}, {"Title": "samsung L100. good and bad", "Author": "Margot N.

To my knowledge there is no way to take the shake mode off when not using flash. I usually use a tripod or my hands but I am always still.

Lightweight2. Durable3. Good battery lifeBad points:1. Picture quality (at times I feel the flash is not effective enough to produce a good picture and photos still look quite dark however I have to say I'm not a photography expert this is just my personal opinion. I've previously had two previous cameras with lower megapixels and personally feel they had better flashes and produced better quality pictures).2. Not reliable - as another user has also mentioned, this camera has lost photos I have taken (later after taking the picture it will error and lose them when I look through), it has also done the same error when downloading pictures to my computer (which is very disappointing especially when they are photos you wish to keep). Last of all, this camera has also combined two pictures into one, which interesting as it is, it's also disappointing when you've taken nice pictures and wished not to have them combined (as they were ruined).As a result (and I'm persuming this may just be a fault with my camera, not all samsung cameras), I am now purchasing a new camera, as this one is too unreliable for me and it has not encouraged me to purchase another samsung.", "Date": "March 13, 2011"}, {"Title": "Perfect camera for non professionals", "Author": "Redd =) \"sj\"", "ReviewID": "R3UOHNESPFSJG7", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I have had this camera for over a year.

On Thanksgiving Day, last year, I had my sister take some pictures of my family (I refuse to pay studio prices when I can get a print for a very low price at Walmart).  I blew up the one I liked to a 16x20 to hang on my wall.  It turned out perfectly.  No distortion or pixelation(if that's the right word).  I take my own pictures, individuals, of my children.  They are also all on the wall. 8x10, and of course they look magnificent.  I think it's very easy to use, and love it.  However, I made a bad choice and took my camera on a river rafting trip.
