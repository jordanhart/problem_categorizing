{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Great for Photos and Videos", "Author": "Aaron Zahn", "ReviewID": "RMWIKPC8W152T", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I've had my 5R for maybe a month and a half now, and so far it's been really great. One thing that I like about it that I'm not sure that other cameras have is the ability to shoot video in manual mode. With this you can choose the ISO, aperture, and most importantly (for me) shutter speed of the video, which I didn't really think would matter much at first, but I do alot of filming parkour stuff and when your slowing down 60 fps footage to get some slow motion the high shutter speed will make your video nice and crisp. I also found out that I enjoy photography a lot more then I thought I would when I got this camera, I hadn't done a lot of it before I got this camera, but I've found myself pulling off roads now just to take pictures of things now.I don't like that I can't see the screen that well on bright days, so a viewfinder could be nice, but at the same time I can't see myself taking the video with my eye up to one because I dont really like the body height angle alot of the time. One other thing is that it has no external audio in on it and the buit in mic is not great, this lost it a star because now I have to either buy their $120 shogun mic or another audio solution.I would reccomend this to anyone. I don't really have a great perspective of this vs other cameras but for the money and size of the camera, it shoots awesome photo/video and I'm more than happy with it. As I said earlier the only reason it got 1 star off is because there's no external audio port, but I've been thinking about getting something portable with a lapel mic anyways so it's not a huge deal.Hope my review helped. It's 3:30 AM so sorry if I ended up talking around myself haha.", "Date": "May 5, 2013"}, {"Title": "Best Camera I have ever owned", "Author": "Justin Garrard", "ReviewID": "R2N1UFDQWBJKZO", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Picked up this camera just before leaving for France where my company was sending my wife and I for 3 months.We ended up taking \u22488,500 pics with it in those three months, and have been completely happy with the ease of use of the camera, size, and most importantly incredible quality of pictures that it took all over the diverse photographic subjects that the European continent could provide.Some of the items in the extra kit weren't as useful as others, but the price compared to the brick and mortar stores can't be beat.I highly recommend this camera to anyone wanting to take a step up from the point and shoot realm, but not wanting to drag around a giant National Geographic Explorer style DSLR.My only warning though... the 5R is great as I have said... however it ends up making you want to do better and better, so don't be surprised if a NEX 6 or 7 are in your future!", "Date": "August 30, 2013"}, {"Title": "Awesome Camera", "Author": "M.

Too many good features to list. Nice to put old Leica, Nikon and Pentax lenses back to work with adapters. A few are superb. The Sony kit lens does a fine job. I use it most often. Menu learning curve is a little steep - you walk before you run. Wi-fi linking to laptop could be a lot easier and more complete. USB jack came loose after a few weeks but warranty repair was outstandingly rapid.  Get extra batteries and the wall charger. If you don't want to spring for the NEX-6 or 7, this is the NEX series fallback. Absolutely pleased with the product.", "Date": "April 26, 2013"}, {"Title": "Nice Camera", "Author": "M. Johnsen", "ReviewID": "R3IVBVBL48CHL5", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I choose this camera based on the recommendation of 2 other people that had it.  The camera is very easy to use.  I like the additional software features such as WIFI and easy transfer to my iPhone.  I would like to add a zoom lens down the road since the one that came with the camera is average.  I recommend this camera to anybody that is not a huge expert in photography!", "Date": "March 6, 2013"}, {"Title": "Truly a great camera for the price", "Author": "David W", "ReviewID": "R5BQTUNWBV3E5", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I really enjoy this camera.  The size belies the options available.  This camera has several options you'd only see in a larger camera.  The size is great, but it will not fit in your pocket.  The lens makes sure of that.  The picture quality is excellent and will save in RAW format for the Photoshop crowd.  I wouldn't call this an amateur product, but more of an entry-level professional camera.  For those of you who are looking to enter photography, great camera.  For those of us who aspire to take pictures other than our dog (okay, most of mine are of the dog), this camera is probably way more than we would ever need.Pros:  Professional level camera at a decent price.Cons:  Will not fit in your pocket.  If you have lenses from other non-Sony cameras, don't expect to reuse them here.  All of the lenses for my Canon DSLR did not fit on this camera even with the convertor.  If you already have lenses, I strongly encourage you to see if they will fit otherwise you'll need to buy them again.", "Date": "January 23, 2014"}, {"Title": "Great camera BUT I should have bought the NEX6", "Author": "MexicoRealtor", "ReviewID": "R3LE4Q9G1NQM3L", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Really enjoying the size of the camera. It is MUCH smaller than my Nikon D300s AND I can use the lenses I already own. I bought a lens adapter and can manually use my Nikon lenses. The NEX5R has a great visual utility to show you what is in focus so the manual thing is not a big deal. I REALLY am missing the viewfinder though. Doing it all again, I would buy the NEX6. Spend the extra cash if you can.", "Date": "August 3, 2013"}, {"Title": "Outstanding camera", "Author": "Maj Michael Sullenger Ret", "ReviewID": "RERIX8K5JGL5D", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "versatile and easy to use.

Goold", "ReviewID": "R358M0W6XTOSV6", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Camera was bought mainly to take baby, family, and vacation photos. It has taken great pictures and makes it easy to get quality photos. Takes a little time to figure out, for us who were not too familiar with the numerous modes and functions. We have not used the video capability. For the same cost of the camera alone this package is wonderful. I definitely recommend this.", "Date": "June 2, 2013"}, {"Title": "camera is OK, attachments are not very good", "Author": "wsma02", "ReviewID": "RFO132TASRLP5", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "the camera works good, but several attachments are not from the SONY company.

Gehman", "ReviewID": "R2Q26ZLZEV345X", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I will keep this short as there are already loads of helpful reviews and comparisons. I love my Nex-5R and the bundle deal was a bonus. The pictures and videos are phenomenal considering it's size. However, there is a major design flaw - the audio.The onboard mics are not stellar to start with plus the metal rings on the neck strap cause an audible clicking sound when moving briskly. Sony offers an external mic which looks promising but I have read sub-par reviews of it. Studio quality audio is not to be expected from an onboard mic, we all know that, but most (maybe all) cameras marketed for high quality video have a way to input an external mic. Not the Nex5R. To make matters worse, the mini-hot shoe uses a digital communication protocol, so there's no hack-a-modding a mic into the pins. One brave modder cut up his external mic but even it cannot support true stereo. So now you know.Pros:Beautiful pictures and video*Loads of custom settingsSmall sizeInterchangeable lensesCons:Sad audio for the priceCannot charge battery while camera is onMenus could be more user friendlyI would gladly give 5 stars if Sony released an external audio input module.

I am a Mechanical Engineer and work with plastics, the door was either stressed before it arrived to me or made with \"regrind\" plastic.I spoke with Beach Camera about this, they gladly accepted the return, gave me the shipping tag, etc....and then tonight (a week later) I received the camera back with a \"NOT ACCEPTED\" note.I was NEVER contacted by Beach, I was pre-approved, and then furthermore, the return shipping was completely inadequate, there was no packing in the box, the camera was like a baby rattle!I don't know what to say accept I am really disappointed with their customer service. I told the first service rep right over the phone that the battery door broke off, why make me ship it back only to deny my claim?Hopefully when I call tomorrow they can help me rectify the situation, if so I will update this review.", "Date": "February 12, 2013"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": "$749.99", "Features": "Sony NEX5TL/B 16-50 Power Zoom Kit\n32 GB Secure Digital High Capacity (SDHC) Memory Card - Class 10\nSpare High Capacity Battery, 3 Piece Filter Kit\nDeluxe Padded Case, HDMI Cable and MORE!", "Name": "Sony NEX-5TL/B NEX5TL NEX5T NEX5 Compact Interchangeable Lens Digital Camera with 16-50mm Power Zoom Lens ULTIMATE BUNDLE with 32GB High Speed Card, Spare Battery, Deluxe Filter Kit, Mini HDMI cable, SD card reader, Padded case + More!", "ImgURL": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41r2yufEGuL.jpg", "ProductID": "B00946HJAA"}}
