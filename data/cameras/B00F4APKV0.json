The bundle pretty much has all the really  necessary accessories, including a decent case, extra battery ( a must for any camera) and a nice size 32gb memory card, car charger, cleaning kit etc. As to the camera itself, it takes excellent pictures. This is my 3rd Lumix , I upgrade every few years so I kind of knew what to expect. Most of my pictures are wildlife so the 60x optical zoom was  a major factor . It has not disappointed.  Sometimes the auto focus struggles a bit, especially further out in the zoom range, but that's to be expected, and especially if you're shooting with the camera hand held as opposed to on a tripod. If you're looking for a good alternative to a DSLR, or want a 2nd camera to complement your DSLR, for times when you don't want to be dealing with multiple lenses etc. , this camera fills the bill nicely.", "Date": "December 8, 2013"}, {"Title": "Camera great but camera bag no so much!!", "Author": "Susan G.
