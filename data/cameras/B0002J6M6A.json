The 8 x optical zoom and the .4 in. macro option is what sold me on this camera.  I have had it for about two weeks now and have taken some great pictures.  I can not beleave the the detail I can get in my close up shots.  The only reason I did not give this camera a five is because once I take it off of auto I find it hard to figure out some of the other settings even when I have read how to do it in the manual.

It is far and above my favorite as of right now. The digital viewfinder is excellent as is just about everything is on this camera.The only flaw or problem with it is the lack of ability to focus in low light, such as dusk or at night in the home with minimal room lighting. Last week I found a deer in my yard, I was able zoom into the face, but couldn't get the camera to focus lock. (It was just as the sun was setting) If you do much low light shooting, this camera is a pain.Daylight or average room lighting, this camera is OUTSTANDING.", "Date": "July 8, 2005"}, {"Title": "Very nice product for the price", "Author": "Ken Bergren", "ReviewID": "R2NPXLSH07PFEL", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I picked this camera up from a department store as a dispaly model for $132.  With the savings I picked up two 256mb SD cards.  I am constantly amazed by this product.  Although it does have difficulty focusing at night, the lens cap is not attached and has a built-in only flash, the pictures I get are perfect for my needs and any color issues or red eye are just a mouse click from perfection!  I was prewarned by others to get an external power source and to always have extra batteries.  However, I've been pleasantly surprised with only two battery changes in well over 300 shots.  There seems to be layers and layers of built-in functions, options and modes that I haven't even begun to tap.  The optical zoom has enough power alone that I've rarely gone into the digital zoom, which is a function I haven't found to be useful on other cameras, let alone this one.  The movie mode is adequate for quick flicks, but there is no sound.  Fine by us as our digi camcorder covers that base.  Still very new to us, so time will tell.

I think it is a great camera for the price(below $200). The picture quality is awesome and 3.2 MP is more than enough. The best part of this camera are the ultra zoom, macro and amazing battery life. I have taken over 100 pictures and all of them are very clear. The macro mode of the camera is very cool. The shutter lag is hardly noticeable and better than most cameras including sony. The only concern of this camera is it takes some time to adjust the focus at night, but the delay is not much either. The lens cap is completely detachable from the camera. So you have to remember it to keep it at a safe place.

The product has a lot of controversy: most love it, some hate it. Here is what I have to say:Overall, a great travel camera and outdoor pictures are just fantastic. 8x zoom is superb, you can really get smallish things in detail. Colors are great when outside. Macro functions are just awesome - you can bring camera to an inch from the object and get a crisp, clear picture! And tons of manual controls - you can control shutter speed, aperture, focus, sensitivity, which was particularly nice to get better quality snaps - I strongly recommend before you start taking pictures to read the manual carefully - it is good - and learn how to use all the features. It CAN be a point and shoot camera, but sometimes you just cannot count on using the automatic setup to get what you want. Until I did it, some pictures were disgraceful. When I learned the camera, most are amazing.Now, some problems:First two I quickly learned how to deal with:1. Night pictures often don't come out nice - use night portraitfeature and white balance. HIGHLY recommended to get tripod if you want to shoot during the night2. Red colors are too conspicuous in indoor and night shots - once again, learn to use white balance!!!! Actually, most of it can also be made up for using their amazing imaging software - I really loved it, it works, and it is relevant.3. Now REAL problems - when indoors or bad light, autofocus may or may not work - it is pretty much the matter of luck. My only recommendation - take several pictures and see what comes out right. For this, I also recommend to have at least 256 mb SD card for this machine.4. And the shutter speed for indoor filming is unpredictable - once again, it may come up just right or may - well... get your pictures dark.The buttom line: if you need camera mostly for indoor use like taking pictures at the parties - probably, there are other models available for the price. If you are outdoorish, travel a lot and mostly take outside - this is an amazing buy for the money.And yes, it will look great on you!

It did not disappoint me.  My 10-year-old had it up in running in no time with no previous camera experience.  The software is great even with my win98se O/S. It gives you many choices for resolution and quality (compression)but even at 640x480 it takes nice pictures, giving you 150 pictures on the 16M card it comes with. The max 3.2 megs on this is plenty of resolution unless you want to do posters.  What a deal. Made in Korea, and they can be picked up new for a song online with extended warranty.

I narrow the search and I found 3 cameras with less than an inch macro focal distance (actually 1 centimeter since in my country we use the metric system). and this one was the only one that I could afford. well, when I put my hands on the box, unpack and see that was so tiny and the plastic case looks so cheap, I say \"wow, a fisher price digital camera\".but then this tiny monster probes me that you never must judge a book by his cover or a man by his clothe. I immediately put it on macro mode and take few shots. even with a less than zero knowledge about photography, I could take decent pics of my miniatures just taking out of the box. of course all in auto because I said, first time that I use a digital camera in my life and before that, few pics with an old polaroid.the thing is that I was impressed with the sharpness and the clarity of the pic. so much that I feel frustrated. yeah, I feel frustrated when I note that my good looking hand painted miniatures has brushes fails and misses that I couldn't note with my magnification glass and less with my bare eye.since that I work harder on my miniatures but the brutally awesome macro mode always find my fails and that is just using the circular fluorescent lamp og the magnification glass that I have in the painting table.but when the camera proves his endless worthiness in the macro miniature field then I move on, and star to take it with my to lots of metal concerts. I was really afraid because the camera looks really cheap and fragile, and I thought that my poor bayb will not gonna make it when the moshers starts to move.but not only get hits but dust, sweat and even beer and my beloved Z10 take the punishment as a sherman tank could do it. little local concerts, big metal foreign bands, crappy set of lights, awesome reflectors and lasers sets, really \"moving\" and exited crowd, the Z10 took everything, with great velocity, sharpness and clarity even when the general complain is his poor low light maneuverability. until know never disappoint me. iron maiden, kiss, cradle of filth, brujeria, obituary, was just few bands that visit my country and I take pictures so great that lots of people consider me a pro photographer and congratulate me for my talent. they just don't know about my \"secret weapon\". god I love my little camera.I take it to the shooting range too and take great pictures of the drills and competitions, and even could take awesome pictures of a mac 10 .45 ACP shooting a burst. but the real challenge for my cheap looking was not get broke when the big .300 RUM shoot. well, another challenge that accept and pass like the best.even a year ago I travel to Argentina to see Rammstein and Twisted Sister. the first one was my biggest concert till now. 45k people, all metal fans, and just me and my little camera to do the job. we couldn't reach the stage and the near distance that I got was like 20 meters (60 feet I think), and then the 8x optical zoom save my life. decent pictures of Till Linderman and Co, but the crowd was really wild and we get more hits than a pi\u00f1ata. at the next day I still have the marks of the viewfinder in my chest, neck and cheek, because we was crushed by the crowd but still, the Z10 do the job. sadly the dial get a little damage and now sometimes when I barely tough, jumps to the next mode. even that we take the awesome pics in the super poor and low light conditions of the Twisted Sister gig. I return home with awesome pictures of both gigs and Argentina but looking for a Purple Heart for my Z10.  =)I bought a fujifilm finepix s400 but simply was not so good, the optical zoom is great and 14 mp was great but the low light condition and focus velocity is really bad compared with the Z10. with the zoom out I feel shivers down my spine for just imagine that dropping from my hands. and of course lets not talk about the macro, where the Z10 kicks soooooo badly the fuji.actually the Z10 is a little bit retired. I have a Nikon D70s DSLR camera and a D5100 on the way. the fuji, I sold it, and my Konica Minolta will be me and die with me, I just simply can't sell it at any price (seriously, I have offer of almost 300$ and still say no), because she has a real sentimental value and even with a great lens like the sigma 17-70m 2.8-4 OS Macro, I still like more the macro pics of the Z10.at the end, if someday I have a kid, I will give teach him with the Nikons and then I will gift him the Z10 as heritage, because that camera is legendary!!!  =)", "Date": "February 9, 2008"}, {"Title": "This camera was attatched to me ALWAYS!", "Author": "Heather Anne-Veronica \"Heather\"", "ReviewID": "R9P585AJQ5ZNE", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Hi, I just received a new camera as a gift so I am selling my Kinoca Minolta camera, but I have to tell you in all honesty  I AM IN LOVE with this camera.It has a lower mega pixel then you can find in newer models, but you would NEVER know that from looking at the photos it takes.

This camera been wonderful since we got it 2 years ago. The first year we had it we stored over 2000 pictures on our computer making it easily pay for itself when compared to the standard camera it replaced.This camera takes crisp, quick pictures. For me the lag time is most important as we have small children. If the camera doesn't take the picture quickly it is useless. You do need to practice getting the camera locked into focus before taking the picture in order for it to be very fast but overall I have been able to take wonderful pictures of my children.The zoom and macro features are wonderful as well allowing me to get close up pictures and details on things that can be difficult with other cameras.The only downside could be the size of the camera as it cannot fit into a pocket.
