{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Fantastic pocket still camera and video camera", "Author": "Dr Julie Valentine DDS Dentist", "ReviewID": "R15QRUGQGSCLAZ", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Kodak V610 reviewI have owned this camera for about 3 weeks, and I love it.  I have captured about 4 hours of video inside and outside and about 200 still shots inside and outside.The V610 is a consumer point and shoot still camera and a great 640 by 480 - 30 frame per second movie camera, both with 10 times zoom.  If you are looking to have a camera in your pocket whenever you come upon a situation where you want to take a high quality snapshot or a home movie video, I highly recommend this camera.  It is fantastic.  It takes a reliable snapshot and a very smooth video and fits into my shirt pocketHowever, if you are looking to be the next Ansel Adams or need professional videos ... get other much larger and more expensive cameras, with much larger lenses and much more powerful lights.In my opinion, this is the best and most powerful shirt pocket sized camera on the market today.Prior to this I owned a digital still camera an Olympus Camedia C-4040 4MP Digital Camera w/ 3x Zoom and a very small DV video tape camera, a Panasonic model PV DV 201.  Now that I own the V610, I no longer have to carry a camera bag with me to the zoo, or family reunions or other events.  As a replacement for both of those cameras, this is a fantastic choice.I can't tell you how many times I have seen great photo opportunities at events in the last several years before I owned this camera, but the appropriate camera was either in the camera bag or in the car, and how often I wanted greater than a 3x optical zoom in my still camera.The 6.1 megapixel resolution is sufficient to allow you to capture nice snapshots, and with a powerful 10x optical zoom, you can be sitting in the back row still get a great still shot or a video and the video to my eye is nearly the equal of a consumer quality DV tape camera.  I think that this is one of a very few digital still cameras that allow you to optical zoom while shooting videos.As with most camera purchases additional equipment is necessary to make the camera most useable.  I purchased the following additional equipment to go with the camera:>> A 2GB high speed (x133) SD memory card which it allows me to shoot a combination of up to almost one hour of video or up to about 1,100 - 6 megapixel still shots- that's right, one hour of MPEG-4 video fits on the 2gb card, with good TV quality video and sound.  I paid about $85.00 USD.>> 3 spare non-Kodak brand batteries.  I paid about $12.00 USD each.>> A 6 in 1 San Disk PC card adapter - card reader for my laptop - no software needed for the laptop, and the SD memory card acts just like a hard drive and I copy the still pictures and the .mov quicktime videos to my hard drive (the provided USB cable is too slow and the camera needs to be turned on the entire time during downloads with a cable).  I paid about $24.00 USD.>> A thin leather case - To protect the camera.  I paid about $15.00 USD.>> A 250gb USB2 external hard drive for backing up the photographs and movies.", "Date": "May 30, 2006"}, {"Title": "Non-protruding 10x optical zoom in sleek body", "Author": "CB", "ReviewID": "R1EMT35TJAP5PJ", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Positive:- 10x optical zoom works well (in good light or with mini  tripod).- Zoom lens does not protrude, very stealthy.- When using digital zoom, pictures are not artificially interpolated back to the requested size but are kept at the recorded smaller size.- Blur indicator when reviewing.- Camera controls and menues are adequate.- On-camara panorama stitching.- High quality MPEG4 movie mode 640x480@30fps, size only limited by storage card. Optical zoom can be operated during movie.- Small size full metal body.- Adequate LCD resolution (I value LCD resolution higher than raw LCD size).- Bluetooth transfer works well (tested with Axim X50v PDA).- Full bound paper manual.Neutral:- I don't mind the gap during zooming at the lense switch (need to release zoom rocker and press again, magnification jumps over missing range, does not digitally interpolate unlike V570), and I appreciate the other gap before digital zoom kicks in.- I would have been happy to live with an even larger gap if the wide-angle range had been extended down to that of the V570.- Battery life not too good but batteries readily and cheaply available. Likewise for external battery charger. Cheap aftermarket products (Ebay) work well for me (so far).- No bundled accessories like docks that I would not use anyway.- Going through favorities mode to review mode seems to be the only way to review pictures with the front lens protector kept closed.- Somewhat non-standard movie container (quicktime .mov). I use mencoder with options -of avi -ovc copy -oac mp3lame -lameopts abr:br=96 to switch to .avi (or -of mpeg for mpeg container) without reencoding the mpeg4 video stream (fast, no quality difference).Negative:- No optical image stabilization. Electronic image stabilization for movie mode only.- Image noise at all ISO speeds.- Max aperture quite limited, especially for the zoom lens, tries to compensate with high ISO speeds, noisy pictures.- Writing to storage card is slow (even for high speed SD cards), very noticable when using burst mode.- 5 second review delay after shooting cannot be switched off or customized.- Does not remember most settings, always starts up in auto mode.- No way to find out which iso speed/aperture/exposure time will be used when halfway depressing shutter button and even which settings have been used when reviewing pictures inside the camera (no good excuse for this I could think of). Need to copy file to computer and read the exif tags.- On-camara panorama stitching frequently shows visible stitching errors. Can only stitch 3 (or 2) images, not more than 3. Very picky about alignment.- Expensive.I did not use the flash so far.I did not use the bundled the software (unsupported operating system).Conclusion:Camera has limitations, some of understandable technical nature, others unnecessary (hiding too many details from the user, could be fixed in firmware but probably won't) but overall is a keeper. Fun factor is very high.", "Date": "June 18, 2006"}, {"Title": "Fast as it is small", "Author": "Killy \"ben29540\"", "ReviewID": "R1PTMZWUO50CRD", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This camera is a pleasure to use.  I haven't enjoyed a new piece of hardwarethis much since I bought my first Mac Powerbook 3 years ago.I had a 3-year old camera before, solet me say what was bad about that one, and why the V610 is so much better.1)  0 - > Picture time : It would take my last camera more than 5 seconds toturn before it was ready to take a picture.  The V610 is almost instantaneous.Part of this is that it doesn't have a protruding zoom lens that needs to mechanicallymove before the picture can be taken.2)  Time between pictures:  My last camera would also take more than 5 secondsto load the image between pictures.  The V610 can take 1.6 pictures per second athighest quality in burst mode.3) Menu :  My last camera had a non-intuitive menu to find things.  With the V610,I haven't had to look at the manual yet because it is so obvious how to proceed.There are a lot of easily accessible picture modes, and I do suggest you spendsome time familiarizing yourself with them, since they can greatly improveyour picture quality by for instance decreasing exposure time for action shots,or allowing in more light for night time portraits.4) Battery :  I used some top of the line AA rechargeable batteries on my lastcamera.  These used to let me take 50 pictures before discharging.5) Lens cap:  I was surprised when I took my last camera out of the package and itdidn't have a lens cap.  I doublechecked that this one does has an automatic slidingone before I bought it.  It slides back and forth instantaneously when you turn on/off.Here are a few cons :  * There is no viewfinder.  You have to use the large screen on the back to  target your shot.  This turns out not to be a problem in the day time, since  the screen quality is great even in the sun's glare.  At night though, it is hard  to target pictures of close subjects in the complete dark.  However, I found that if you  push the button down slightly, a green light is emitted that reflects off your  subject and allows you to see them.  When I realized this I had no problem in  targeting pictures of close objects.Here are a few other pros :  * I love the bluetooth.  I took some pictures and easily beamed them to a friend's  laptop without having to have cables.  Bluetooth isn't so fast though, so I  recommend just using Bluetooth to send smaller images to people.  * Use the SD memory card to move the pictures onto your computer with one  one of those miniature USB flash floppy drives.  The SD memory card is  compatible with  other pieces of hardware.  I use it also for my MP3 player.  I have an old SanDisk Cruzer with removable SD card.  I used to use a 128 MB  card with my old camera, but now I use a GB card for my kodak camera.  They  are all compatible with the Cruzer.", "Date": "July 19, 2006"}, {"Title": "Love this smart, simple, and cool digital camera.", "Author": "White Doberman", "ReviewID": "R28GK8TPLKU5QK", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I'm a professional photographer who has resisted the digital camera world until now. I really would have preferred to buy a Nikon, but the reviews (Cnet. Crutchfield and here) were so poor on the images I looked further. I almost bought a Panasonic with a Lieca lens, but it has a lens cap and looks/design sucks. If you want a zoom, and you should, buy this camera. It's excellent and the bluetooth works quickly and perfectly with my Mac. It's quite simple to use as well, the only thing I needed to look up was the email function. Two of the best things about this is there is no protruding lens on this huge zoom and there for no lens cap. Though I'll never use it for client work, it's better than I would have guessed for a point and shoot. Oh and the image quality is great for that too. It's also small enough to take everywhere.Three things: Buy an actual camera case like Zing, an extra battery and a SanDisk Ultra11 SD 1GB USB card. It's faster than other cards and the USB plugs directly into my Mac. This is perfect for downloading movies from the camera - which are sweet.", "Date": "September 19, 2006"}, {"Title": "It's physical size does not represent it's functionality", "Author": "Jasper Jonson \"pinoyjrj\"", "ReviewID": "RKV1G83239M89", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Kodak dubs this camera as the smallest 10x on the market.  Regardless of it's size, it's functionality is very efficient.  The presets make up for it's lack of manual options, and the time from turning on the camera to when you can take a picture is very speedy.  I would suggest this camera to anyone looking for a wonderful point and shoot that takes beautiful shots, and still has  the bells and whistles of larger cameras.", "Date": "July 10, 2006"}, {"Title": "Kodak finally got its tradition back", "Author": "Tom", "ReviewID": "R1CTBEBYSVOBDE", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Wow, optical 10x in a small package! That's the innovation we expect from Kodak. I owned a Kodak before and it started to malfunction (dysfunctioal 2x zoom ) only after one year. The next one I owned is a Canon A85. A wonderful machine and is solid built. As time goes on, I kind of like to have a camera that is VGA video capable with enough zoom power. Then it comes the V610. At first I was skeptical due to past experience. After reading so many positive reviews, I decided to give Kodak another shot.After using it for almost 3 weeks, I have to say that Kodak delivered 95% of it. The response is quick, zoom is excellent. The only complaint I have is that under low light condition, the auto-focus does not function very well, but I guess most cameras are like this at this price range. However, my Canon seems to do better in this regard. Another thing is the battery life. If you want to use it as your camcorder, another battery is necessary to keep the juice flowing. Nonetheless, the Kodak battery is cheap ($16) enough to justfy getting an extra one.The zoom does have a jump between 3.4x to 4x, but the quality is good and doesn't bother me much. I do love the dual-lens design, which is very unique and way cool! This is the kind of engineering innovation we expect from Kodak. I am surprised that at 10x, the photo is still not blurry as most people would think. Of course you need to be a little steadier than usual, but most of the time you will get good pictures under good light.However, the only thing unsure is the quality. My last Kodak camera start to have problems after only one year. Let's hope that won't be the case this time.I am using it both as a camcorder and a camera. With a 2GB SD card, I have plenty storage to shoot around. For casual camcorder users (most people are), this is a perfecct unit. Whoever tried to download and convert a video clip from a mini-DV camcorder konws the painful process of downloading/converting/burning. With this camera, the video is already compressed in MPEG 4 format. Downloading from high speed SD card is way way faster than miniDV and burning to a DVD is also no big deal. This camera essentially solved all my problems with my digital camcorder. I haven't tried the bluetooth yet, but I doubt I will need it. I use a card reader and that will give you the highest speed for downloading large files.Overall, this a perfect package for everyday photo and video shooting. I just wish that the battery can last longer. But hey, with a small package like this, not much more you can ask at this moment until more powerful batteries are out.", "Date": "September 25, 2006"}, {"Title": "The stitching function is really cool for scenery shots", "Author": "C. K. Chan \"clemchan\"", "ReviewID": "R2CHE00PM6AXU", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "This is my fourth Kodak digital camera. I bought this one because of the small size and the 10X optical zoom. The last Kodak that I bought was a 7490 which also has a 10X optical zoom but kind of bulky. In terms of the picture quality I think the V610 suffers a little bit because the size of the lenses are quite small. At 10X zoom it is also hard to hold the camera completely still because there is no viewfinder so you have extend your arms to use the LCD screen to shoot. What I really like about the V610 is the stitching function. I have taken my V610 hiking in the Rocky Mountains and those wide angle scenery shots with three pictures stitched together are really awesome. If you don't need 10X optical and I think you have to use a tripod to get good pictures anyway, the V570 maybe a better choice.", "Date": "July 6, 2006"}, {"Title": "dont buy it...", "Author": "Tyler Riggs \"hpd\"", "ReviewID": "R3F747GG0UFO8S", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "**UPDATE AS OF 4/10/07**It died on me.

I have been the main picture taker on our family vacations and get-togethers.  We had a 10X optical, 5 MP kodak camera that worked well, it was just big and bulky, never to fit in a pocket.  The 10X optical zoom on the V610 also works well, the lenses never protrude from the camera when I use the optical zoom.  The viewing screen is large and very clear.  The menus are very easy to navigate and the on camera editing tools are great.  It would also make a fine camera for a beginner.  The panorama function works very well also.  I have used it multiple times with ease and it created great pictures. The camera turns on quickly and the time between pressing the button and the photo capture is quick.  I have had the camera for about a month now and the best thing is the small size without having to compromise in zoom, picture quality, or functionality.  The LCD screen does take up some more battery than other cameras just because it is larger, but don't let that stop you from getting the camera.  You will be able to take at least 70 or so pictures on a battery and a lot more if you are conservative.  My only small frustration was when going skiing, I attempted to video my brother coming down the slope using the 10X optical zoom and the image stabilizer.  It was at night and only the lights were on, the camera wouldn't focus on him until he was close, but that may be just because of the low light conditions and glare from the snow. Otherwise the video has worked flawlessly.  There is even a terrific function that allows you to pause the video at any time during playback and create a picture from that video frame. (Very useful)  My brother bought the Panasonic Lumix\u00ae DMC-TZ1K,(a very good camera also) before i got the V610 and now he wishes he got the V610.", "Date": "March 21, 2007"}, {"Title": "Great little camera!", "Author": "Think Positive", "ReviewID": "R2E56Z2OAAQP80", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This is my 3rd Kodak digital camera (can't resist new toys!) and they just keep getting better each time! I've had a Fuji which was nice, and an Olympus (died after a month, received no response to a letter written) but this Kodak rocks! There are a lot of features packed into this convenient little package. It has a very solid quality feel to it, nothing plastic or cheap. The zoom is absolutely incredible - there isn't a smaller camera with a longer zoom available. The best part is the dual lens - there isn't a long lens that protrudes when you zoom. The buttons are well placed and easy to use. The menus are so easy you don't even need to open the manual to figure out how to do most functions. The panorama stitching is so cool, but stitching 2 photos together is really the best. When you stitch 3 together, it starts to distort a little. I haven't tried the bluetooth yet, but sending a photo to or from my cell phone is a really nice feature. The battery charger is compact, nice for travel, and the built in lens cover is brilliant. Can you tell I love this camera?! The only drawback I've found so far is with low-light pictures. It isn't bad for close range shots in low light, but the quality drops the farther out you zoom. Not all that surprising, but this camera is so amazing, I'm probably just too demanding at this point. There is no viewfinder either, which I prefer, especially for very bright light pictures, but the large LCD screen is very nice. I took this camera to Alaska on a cruise. I was on a 120' yacht as well as paddling around in a kayak and zipping around in a zodiak inflatable. No matter where I was, I had this camera with me and it took great shots everywhere. I don't have the most steady hand, but this camera took awesome shots all the time. I got great shots of a bear on shore while I was floating in a kayak, a lot of amazing shots of eagles, whales, sea lions, you name it, I shot it. I used the \"sport\" mode which helped a lot since there isn't a stabilization feature. But I got shots of eagles in flight that look like they should be on a postcard.

The zoom was spectacular. Although I did find that sometimes it was difficult to focus on very distant subjects (ie. birds, wildlife) If you have trouble focusing on far zooms, press the button 1/2 way and wait for it to re-focus. You can repeat this a couple times until you get your subject to focus.  Other than that...the photo clarity was fantastic. Quick to turn on.

I love the many features it offers such as the panoramic feature that stitches the images right in the camera not later on your computer, or the screen flips to show the picture upright in any direction whe you review pics.

Araujo", "ReviewID": "R3Q9HLEQPZRCDP", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I bought the v610 from Amazon, and put my hands on it about one week ago. It's not so much time, but I think I am ready to write a review. I'll try to be as clear as possible, and try not 'say' what all the others reviews do. So far, my experience with this little wonder was some \"test\" shots. a birthday party and a bicycle riding on a sunny Sunday. It is pretty amazing how much features Kodak could put in to a so small body. The designers and engineers have made a really good job. The camera is very well made. It feels very rigid and strong, and fits very well on my hands. The camera haves a lot of \"scene modes\". You just have to pick-up the one that match your light conditions. This makes the things easy to the inexperienced photographer, but it really lacks some manual settings for the more advanced ones. With some non-automatic controls the camera would become unbeatable. I wonder why didn't Kodak put two more \"scene\" modes on it: Shutter Priority and Aperture Priority? The downside of this plethora of modes is that it can spoil a \"fast\" shoot opportunity. You *will* waste some time finding the mode you want. The workaround: You may use the \"general\" mode that is selected when you turn on the camera (the camera does not \"remember\" the last mode used whet it is turned off). With the auto scene modes you have to accept the settings the camera \"chooses\", that is frequently very good. On sport mode, as example, the camera tends to raise the ISO to 150 or 200, to get a faster shutter speed. It's a logical thing to do, but may introduce some noise to the picture. My sports settings would be a little different, but I can live with it. :-) The lenses are a bit \"dark\" (F.Stop) and you have to be very steady for indoor shots, but, don't forget that it's a ultra-compact. It's always a compromise between size and lens aperture. The Kodak v610 is not a perfect camera, but *remembering it's size and features*, it's a really winner. There is a lot of people, here in the reviews, complaining about the poor picture quality. My advice is: When well used - *knowing what scene mode to choose for each light condition* - the picture quality will be ALLWAYS brilliant. Don't forget: To photograph is to \"get\" the light. It's all about light. The equipment is important, but what makes the difference is the photographer.

I've been using the panoramic stitching feature for the renovation of my house and the pictures come out really cool.

I have an older 3X Kodak camera which is a little better in ergonomics and has a much clearer image on its LCD screen.  Both are a little too bulky for a shirt pocket snapshot camera.The V610 seemed the ideal snapshot camera.  It is beautifully designed to fit in a shirt pocket without a protruding lens and gives needed 10X magnification.  It is as simple to use as you could wish from a full featured camera.  The scene types and stitch are well designed, useful and relatively simple to use.  It has a clear, bright sharp LCD display which my old eyes appreciate in framing my picture.  Unfortunately it has a huge flaw -- no image stabilization -- which makes zoom useless in normal light indoors.The first use of the camera was at my wifes club meeting.  I was to take pictures of the attendees and awards presentations.  Fortunately, I had my Canon S2 IS along because it is simply not possible to hold the V610 still enough to take clear pictures in doors at magnification levels!I know it is a small package to get everything into but it is not as if image stabilization is unknown. Do not buy this camera thinking you are going to sit around a family gathering on Christmas morning and zoom into the kids smiling faces -- every picture will be blurry!  Sure you could use a tripod, but who uses a tripod for snapshots with a shirt pocket camera.

My review won't weigh on the technical details of how this camera performs  as there are more capable people than I to speak to these points.  For the layman..who just wants to point and shoot and take a great picture, please read on!I've had the camera for 10 months now.We are a very active/outdoor family with 2 teenage boys.  I wanted ONE camera device that could mulit-task and not take up much room when packing.I wanted a COMPACT, digital camera with decent video and VERY GOOD zoom ability to capture pictures of my kids playing soccer.  I am an avid kayaker and wanted pull the wild horses and birds up close at Assateague. This little camera fits neatly in a cell phone size dry bag I keep clipped to my pfd strap and is always readily available!Biggest pluses:- 10x optical zoom- COMPACT SIZE(I can and do bring this camera everywhere!!)- Very good video..and has adequate sound.- Large LCD screen- Menus are very intuitive.- Not a battery hog.- Takes great video and pics in very dark conditions.- Great auto settings for different conditions, up close, landscape, beach, night, action shots.- Some blurring in video (while during zoom transitions) .. but only nominally.- Bluetooth!(more of a novelty than need... but pretty cool)I've found I take more videos than I had expected now that I own this camera.  Are they studio quality?... No.  It has GOOD sound.  Good sound to me is when I can clearly hear the kids tease each other about spitting cherry pits at each other, I can hear the horse steps as they walk through the salt marshes, I can hear my boyfriend whisper \"that was so cool\" after paddling with a group of wild horses from one island to another.  I capture the moments and the memory.  I don't MISS any pics or video because I'm only carrying one device that does it ALL and I USE this camera!side note:  the Easy Share docking station was an add-on purchase after I got the camera.

I also purchased a 2 gb memory upgrade and high speed computer upload, S&H; was free. I had to purchase the camera case made for this camera directly from the Kodak website because Beach Camera & Amazon don't carry it. The camera instructions made the camera so easy to use. I have been using it since Halloween 06' and sharing my photo's with family & friends on the Kodak EasyShare website which comes with the camera. The picture quality is great. I took a picture of a Lion at the DC Zoo that was about 40' from me and the 10 zoom lens made the Lion look like it was right in front of me. Everyone that has looked at that shot is amazed and thinks it's post card quality. I also have taken many nite time Christmas tree lights & building Christmas decoration shots in NYC with excellent night time hand held quality. Example the tree at Rockefella Center, all buildings along 5th & 6th Ave's including Radio City Music Hall. If you want a camera with a 10 zoom lens and don't want a larger XL camera this is the camera you are looking for. It's so small it can fit into your shirt pocket.

Under ideal circumstances it takes fine pictures (although our older 3.1 megapixel  Olympus camera tends to come out clearer), however where I see a problem is with indoor lighting.We've been taking photos of our daughter with this and an unusually large percentage of them have some visible blur on them. Even some taken witha tripod have this issue so it's not all because of the camera shake.We have tried most of the settings and have settled on one that is the least offensive, but we still take 4 or 5 pictures of everything, just to make sure we are going to get one that comes out ok.There is an indicator that flashes a colored hand to tell you if the shot is in focus enough for a 3.5x5 picture and we seem to hover in the orange indicator (red being bad, green being good, orange being maybe).Despite this, under brighter lighting and outdoor lighting situations, the camera seems to do very well, and we purchased it as much for its size and  convenience as much as anything.I would recommend this camera, but not with such high ratings as everyone seems to give it. Perhaps it's the lighting in our house, but the overhead 60 watt bulbs seem bright enough for other cameras we have tried.Be a little leary about the claims that you don't lose anything by throwing a 10x zoom in such a small package, but realistically speaking the sacrifice is worth the ability to throw this in your pocket when you're heading out for a hike or day at the beach.", "Date": "January 11, 2007"}, {"Title": "kodak v610 pocket camera", "Author": "Elaine S.

I don't plan on being a photographer nor do I wish to take professional-like pictures in my lifetime. I just wanted a good, pocket-sized camera that I can carry with me and take pictures of me & my friends, plants, animals, or what have you. I asked for two different cameras for Christmas. I asked for a Canon or for this one. I was unsure as to which I wanted more, so I had my mom pick one out for me. I was fairly pleased whenever I saw which camera I had recieved as a gift. I was anxious to try out the 10x optical zoom that the Kodak had. Unfortunately, the optical zoom wasn't enough to help this camera. One would have to have VERY steady hands or a tripod when working with with camera. Although sometimes I'm not sure that it would have helped. I was unaware that the camera didn't come with image stabalization whenever I did ask for it. (It only has video image stabalization--- not i.s. for just picture taking) This means the camera is surely wonderful for free-handed night-time shots. I will include a link to some pictures I've taken with this camera to show-- indeed-- what a GREAT job it does do. *sarcasm*I'm not an expert at using cameras. I've never had a class or any training. I could just be doing something wrong. It's as simple as that. BUT if this camera is THAT hard to use, then I don't want to deal with it.But I think the camera is completely horrible-- in my opinion. Don't buy it for the zoom. The zoom is alright---- simply alright. That really is the ONLY decent thing about this camera. The panoramic shoots are neat but without a tripod they also turn out blurry. Actually, most of my pictures turn out blurry period. I'm not a complete amatuer whenever it comes to digital photography. I know what to do to make a digital picture turn out great. I've been unable to make any of my pictures look great with this camera. I've taken over 500 pictures with it and I could count on two hands the amount I've had turn out decent. &Those; that did turn out decent, I'm not thoroughly impressed with. They're okay. My 3 year old Fuji takes better pictures and has better color & shading. I'm very disappointed with this camera. I not only wasted my money on it, but I also wasted my money on a memory card, a camera case, a dock, and a tripod. I can't send it back now. It's been used and it's been over 30 days since it was ordered, so I'm literally STUCK with it.I've seen/had several cameras in the past.

I cannot stress that enough.Here is a link to pictures I've taken with this camera (these are real-life pictures-- none of that professional stuff): [...]I hope the pictures help people make their decision in the future.

Keller", "ReviewID": "R1FER9LF9ZPVCJ", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I have had this camera for almost 5 years now and it recently broke. During it's lifetime it took countless pictures of outstanding quality.when I was first searching for a quality camera that was convenient and compact I spent roughly 4-5 hours comparing optical zoom to picture resolution to battery life, versatility, functionality, and ease of use.  This camera won hands down in all categories.  In fact, I am currently searching for a replacement camera and I'm noticing that there is no other camera with all the functionality this one has on the market.  Granted, all cameras on the market now blow this one out of the water with resolution but it is apparently rare to find a camera with Bluetooth, 10x optical, compactness, and still be a point and shoot.  The only nitpicking I can do is that it would reset the scene selection when it went to sleep though you can easily turn off the sleep function.Landscape shots:The V610 was really showing off with it's landscape shots; especially with the 3-into-one panorama mode.  I have captured some very beautiful Italian mountain scenes including one of Florence that is absolutely stunning.Portraits:It performed very well, It could Identify what I wanted to see in the photograph and appropriately adjust focus and exposure for each shot.  I never once encountered red-eye nor washed out images. Also, the camera has a built in sensor to detect what orientation the camera is in when you take the photo and auto rotates the photo to upright (I took a photo with the camera upside-down once and flipped the camera right-side-up wile reviewing and the photo maintained correct orientation.  This, unfortunately, prevents you from taking up-side-down pictures)Close ups:Bugs, flowers, Circuit boards I've take photos of all of them and they were crystal clear and vibrant.  I even used it in place of a scanner once to send documents back home.High light: so long as you aren't taking pictures of the sun the photos were good, the camera allowed for manual exposure editing if it happens to guess wrongLow light: flash is good enough for anything nearby but there was one time I couldn't get a photo I really wanted.  It was when a bunch of people were projecting a video game on the side of the student center at my college at 1 am during a new moon (so really dark with a bright square as back light).  I couldn't get both the people and the projection in the same shot.Ease of use:I only read the manual to set up Bluetooth and it turns out I wasn't getting it on the first try due to my computer being anti-social.  How's that for ease of use?In the end, my review is quite late since this camera isn't made anymore and it looks like Kodak is not going to continue making the best camera on the market(it still would be if it wasn't only 6.1 Megapixel) by updating this one.  None the less, I hope to instill a feeling of grandeur(it's no delusion) to any other owners of this camera and possibly convince Kodak that they could own the point-and-shoot market with this camera.", "Date": "May 31, 2011"}, {"Title": "Doesn't quite live up to Kodak name", "Author": "CSGP", "ReviewID": "R38DSOKEW86LDH", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I purchased this camera quite a while ago (2007-08 maybe?) to replace my Kodak V550 that I broke the LCD screen on.  I got it because it was similar looking, the dual lens was interesting (and cool looking), the 10x zoom, the bluetooth connectivity...and well frankly because I loved my 550 and had such a great experience with it.  It seems like a lot in one small package, but this camera left something to be desired, in my book.Here are the main points I'll make about this camera...It was big...much bigger than I had anticipated...much bigger than my 550.  Not very pocketable.Image quality indoors was atrocious.  As in....not even ok.  Like...useless.Outdoor pics were stunning, crisp, and clear.  Zoom was awesome and worked well, again, outdoors.Zooming while filming was LOUD and recorded in the video.  As well as, would stop and jump at a certain point...I guess when switching lenses.Bluetooth wasn't a main feature I used often, but it worked when I did use it.As with all Kodaks, features were easy to use and figure out.  The software was pretty good...no big issues with that.This camera is now about 5 years old and I doubt anyone is going to be reading this to buy it, but I just wanted to get my opinion out there.  Because of the poor indoor picture situation (and after one event too many and not being able to take pics indoors), I finally retired this camera (after about 2 years) and got a Canon.  LOVED the Canon--but just lost it in Philadelphia :(  So I am going back to Kodak (mostly for price/style reasons) and going to try the M590.

Eventually the wider-angle lens stopped working completely. The user manual led me to a company to send the camera in to have it fixed. It ended up costing me over $100 and I had to send it in twice to get it fixed properly, but the service was excellent.This camera has several flashy, cool features. For instance, if you are viewing pictures and turn the camera on its side, the pictures with automatically rotate. I also love the sleek design and the blue lighting around the buttons.It also has its share of unique useful features. The zoom is awesome, and the size is very handy. To my surprise, I have come to love the Bluetooth feature, which wasn't sounding very useful at first. If you take a good picture you can reduce the size and send it to your cell phone or a friend's very quickly and it looks much better than a camera phone could do. I'm pretty impressed with the battery life.The only things that bother me about this camera are that it seems to scratch pretty easily and the LCD display is constantly covered in fingerprints.The display screen does not do the pictures justice; they look much better once you put them on the computer.I am not an experienced photographer but this camera has worked perfect for my purpose.

After seeing a relative's Easyshare V570, I was impressed. More research landed me on choosing the V610, much the same as the V570 but with a 10X optical zoom.I really like the ease of choosing different types of scenes from the series of small icons on the display screen. The camera's ability to take sharp close-ups is the best I have seen, being able to take sharp pictures of small coins from about 2 inches (5 cm). I was somewhat disappointed in the picture's colors when I switched the scene to snow, having to add yellow when improving the pictures on the computer.The camera is a little too heavy to call it a \"shirt pocket\" model. The dimensions allow it to be carried in a shirt pocket, but preferably in a side pocket if wearing a jacket. For convenience I purchased a small leather case which allows me to carry the V610 on my belt much like a cel phone.It is very easy to remove the SD card and slide it into a computer to transfer the photos to the hard drive. Also, inserting an extra newly charged battery is easy and fast if you are on a trip and can't charge the camera directly.Motion pictures are fun and have both good video and audio quality for such a small camera. The camera's menu is convenient and easy to understand. Further, the review of each photo, when taken, is sharp and easy to view even in outisde daylight. All controls are convenient once the user forgets their old camera and becomes use to the V610. One other point that is \"pro\"  is the nice design of the auto-focus that produces sharp images.Batteries, an external charger, a leather case, SD cards, and other supplies for the camera are readily available on the Internet and in local stores.In summary, I enjoy this camera.

I will say that I am also pretty disappointed in the construction of the V610, which has flimsy-feeling buttons with barely any travel/feedback.Add to this a problem that I've been having where videos don't reliably get transferred when syncing with iPhoto (on a Mac, obviously), and it's been a bit of a disappointing experience. I have now lost a few videos (including a Maid of Honor speech from a wedding!) when I didn't realize that they hadn't been transferred and then cleared the memory card on the camera. I'm going to be trying a new firmware revision, so perhaps that will improve performance with iPhoto.These things being said, when its auto-focus manages to focus on anything (which happens less than I'd expect on a decent point-and-shoot, and even less often in lower light), the V610 does actually take pretty good pictures. It has good color balance, the flash fires surprisingly well, and if you use the red-eye function, it actually works if you can get people to sit still long enough while it fires off multiple times.Unfortunately, the best thing about this camera is the cool built in lens cover which slides to the side when it turns on.", "Date": "October 16, 2007"}, {"Title": "It is not what I expected", "Author": "Lalita Franco", "ReviewID": "R3117RCOOCBA2N", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "I bought this camera because the reviews and the specifications.

The first frustration I had before I even shot my first image, was the \"surface\" of the camera!  It showed every finger print and smudge, and it drove me crazy.  I initially loved the \"look\" of the camera (being black!) but, I did not know that there was a texture to it that required constant wiping off.  With that said!  I took \"comparison\" shots (in nature) with my two cameras (Panasonic DMC-FZ20 versus Kodak V610) and was VERY disappointed in the lack of color brilliance (V610)! I was so disappointed that I sent the camera back for a refund (in which they were GREAT about!!!) I am in the woods alot -- my photography is scenery and wildlife; so maybe the camera would be okay for people shots?  I did not keep it long enough to try.  It just did not serve my purposes.", "Date": "April 3, 2007"}, {"Title": "Excellent Choice", "Author": "KIK", "ReviewID": "R1ELVC16KC83CI", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "received in very timely fashionquality exceeds expectationscost less than what was available in my area", "Date": "May 13, 2007"}, {"Title": "kodak Easyshare V610", "Author": "Richard M.
