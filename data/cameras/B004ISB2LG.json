I had it running in no time at all out of the box. It is Chinese made (Shenzhen), but it has all the software on board. The instructions even tell you how to set up a free DNS so,  if you have service through Cox/SBCGlobal/Verizon and your IP address changs, you can maintain your web presence to use the camera over the internet.I set passwords on mine, because I have no desire to share it with the world, but I also have a great little iPhone app that lets me connect whenever I want to it and see what is going on. Slightly dissatisfied with the timing, as I expected a day earlier, but I won't hold that against them.", "Date": "August 1, 2011"}, {"Title": "Audio issues", "Author": "S. Jackson", "ReviewID": "R2W2Z9M5UKWG1P", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "I bought this to install as a baby monitor.  Installation was to be expected with any IP device and its hurdles.  I plugged the camera into my network via cat5 and the camera was found quickly.  I made some configuration changes to the camera and placed it where I wanted it.  The wireless works great!I currently am having problems with the audio and video running at the same time as well as a clicking sound when audio is initiated.  Picture quality is ok for 320*240.  Night-vision is very nice in low/no light.I am currently rating this 2 stars because of the bad sound quality.  I have sent a message to Foscam support for assistance but their site clearly states \"Foscam.us does not provide support or warranties on behalf of any Foscam cameras purchased directly from China and sold on Amazon, Ebay, or other through other resellers.\"", "Date": "November 28, 2011"}, {"Title": "Remote Wireless Camera", "Author": "Dog Watcher", "ReviewID": "R1Z90SQAZWFLQM", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "This remote camera works great.  I use it to watch what is happening with my dog when I am gone.  The night vision is excellent with such a low light source at night.  The one drawback is that if you are technologically challenged (me) you need to purchase the tech support with the camera which would make the install easier.  I happened to have a friend who helped otherwise I would have nice paperweight.", "Date": "November 18, 2011"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": "$75.99", "Features": null, "Name": "Foscam FI8918W Wireless IP Camera with Pan & Tilt, Night Vision, 2 Way Audio, Apple Mac and Windows --White", "ImgURL": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41JMAX0iuDL._SY300_.jpg", "ProductID": "B004ISB2LG"}}
