{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Great Point and Shoot!", "Author": "MoonLiteStar88", "ReviewID": "R2K0PY56AS7Y1Z", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I got this beautiful Coral Pink camera for my birthday about a week ago and I really like it so far! I have not tried this under water so I won't be able to review that yet. I'll edit the review as soon as I do. So let's get to the pros and cons of this camera!Pros:- Zooms while recording.- auto-focuses close up and zooming in while recording.- A bunch of lovely features! (Snow mode, iSweep, Panorama, Pet mode, etc)- Does not take long to start the camera up to point and shoot.- Touch screen is very responsive.- Can use SD cards. Big plus for this! A lot of Sony cameras won't take these.- Can shoot in Full Screen (VGA) or Widescreen.- No weird colored lines when shooting at the sun or bright lights while recording.- Takes beautiful pictures during the day.Cons:- A bit on the pricey side.- You do hear a little bit of a rattling noise in the background while recording but it can only be heard if it's really quiet. I had to exchange for another copy of the camera because the background noise was horrifically noticeable.- Battery life doesn't last long, an hour at the most. Definitely consider buying a few extra batteries if you plan on recording or taking pictures for a long amount of time.- Not finger print or scratch proof. I highly suggest getting a screen protector for the front and back.- It does take a bit of a long time to turn off the recording when you're done. You have to hold it still until it turns off or the video will be pixilated at the very end.- Colors a bit off in low house lights.Other:- The camera records in .MP4 files, easy to edit the movies in Windows Movie Maker Live.- I highly suggest reading the manual before using the camera at the beach or under water.Overall a great little cam! I give this camera between a 4 and a 4.5/5 stars. Sony point and shoot cameras have improved quite a bit over the years. Definitely recommend this one!", "Date": "April 15, 2011"}, {"Title": "Simply Everything I was Expecting", "Author": "HAPPY CAMPER", "ReviewID": "R36HTGGIKZ7CNI", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Well..I just got this camera, & so far so good. One of the things I really like about it is that you can take a picture of an object in complete peach darkness & it still comes out clear. Also, I took a motion pic ( on a reg setting ) without motion setting & it still looked nice. Camera is a lot slimmer than I thought, but that is a good thing.  Slider works perfect, no wobbling.  Close ups look beautiful. Panoramic setting works lovely. I really like the lil extras it comes with, like the writing pen, stamps & pretty borders. Very easy to use. I like the fact that I can delete many pics at the same time. I don't know why ppl say you can't see battery life meter, I can. I'm very pleased & I will let you know if I find something of concern. Keep in mind that there's no such thing as the perfect camera, but there's such thing as the nearly perfect..camera ;-)P.S. I would recommend purchasing an extra battery.", "Date": "February 14, 2011"}, {"Title": "I love it.", "Author": "mimi", "ReviewID": "R3PEW58W03QW00", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I love it. I'm too scared to put it underwater though. but one day I will~ I would like to use this camera when it rains or when I am playing in the mountain snow but I have not had the chance to. The opening slider cover is somewhat of a fingerprint magnet, but that still doesn't take away from it's beauty. I love pink & this pink is the perfect light pink, not hot pink like the other sony cameras...One helpful aspect of this camera is the panoramic shot! I took manyyy panorama pictures while I was in China. Landscapes, or if you have a large family dinner, you can just sweep the camera 270 degrees & you can have a picture of everyone at the table, not just sections of people like normal cameras force you do to. This camera also takes pretty good shots in the dark. The screen shows mostly darkness when you are taking the shot, but after you take the picture and you hold the camera steady, a pretty nice picture comes out surprisingly. I really love this camera and I know it will last me a while because of its ruggedness. & even though it can withstand many things, it still looks sleek & elegant.", "Date": "December 1, 2010"}, {"Title": "I've had mine for 2 years and still love it", "Author": "Kimiko Fox", "ReviewID": "R3PLQJWGDGLHSP", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "My husband bought this for me from Amazon when our daughter was just under 2 years old so I could take pictures and video of her at the beach.Underwater quality is only as good as how clear the water is, but I do like and appreciate that I can take this into the water and not worry about getting it wet!!I most recently went to visit my parents in Hawaii and we stayed at the Aulani (Disney Hotel) that had a mini water park. The pools were EXTREMELY chlorinated and the pink enamel on the sliding cover started peeling off :(The camera still functions perfectly fine but cosmetically it has a bit of a blemish.When I made copies of the video's for my dad (who owns a T3i and is pretty photo savvy for a non-professional photographer) he was shocked at how good the quality of the video was. The stabilization allowed me to chase after my daughter not look like \"shaky cam\" and colors were nice and true.The microphone is a small hole on the front of the camera, and once I realized where the microphone was, I was able to minimize the sound of wind blowing into it when taking outdoor videos.Another trick I picked up for taking shots of my daughter at the beach is that when the sun is behind her and you take a picture, if you turn the flash on it eliminates the heavy shadow you get from a back lit picture. This saved me from needing to photoshop at least 30 photos.By far one of the best gifts from my husband <3**note: uploaded a picture of the enamel on the camera where it peeled. Hope it helps ;)", "Date": "January 7, 2013"}, {"Title": "Best little underwater camera I've found", "Author": "Michael A. Kalm", "ReviewID": "R3GG04UA1AJ43Q", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "This camera is actually a replacement for the same model I bought two years ago.  It must be being closed out, because I paid less for it now than two years ago.  The old camera continued to work fine, except the video stopped recording.  Very odd.  I have no idea why, and as the camera was no longer covered by warranty, i decided a repair would be too costly.For a tiny camera, the image quality is excellent and has most of the bells and whistles I've come to expect from Sony's great camera software.", "Date": "October 22, 2012"}, {"Title": "Very good device", "Author": "Armando", "ReviewID": "R2O48PYJDGHRN1", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Take good pictures underwater and I am facinated with this device, I like a lot to travel to \"water\" sites, Cancun, Cozumel, Los Cabos, etc and this camera allows me to take great pictures underwater. Also it is good taking pictures in a pool party with the kids and family. The panorama option is great to take the \"full picture\", but it is a point and shoot camera, do not expect to have a DSRL quality, but also you are not paying that price $$$$", "Date": "June 5, 2012"}, {"Title": "Great Pictures but Color Chips", "Author": "Judith", "ReviewID": "R2GLQRJ9QX40LW", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I got this as a Christmas present about a year ago. I love how clear the pictures are above and below the water. Im a swim teacher so I wanted the camera to take pictures of my students for their end of the session gifts. I also travel often to tropical locations and was intending to use the camera for snorkeling photos.The camera was a little difficult to get used to but once you understand its not as bad.BE WARNED: The pink color has begun to chip after using it in the water. It is annoying. The color is a pretty pink and underneath it is a silver. The lenses and touch screen also collect smudges and finger prints. While I love the quality of the photos I am afraid of bringing it it on my nest trip to Hawaii for fear of the pink color chipping off.I also recommend a second battery because it tends to die quick. I purchased a floating wrist strap in bright yellow incase I ever did drop it in the water, it tends to keep it on top long enough for a quick grab.", "Date": "September 28, 2011"}, {"Title": "Good choice!", "Author": "Carlos H", "ReviewID": "R31SH2UVF70SLM", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "When I was looking for a new digital camera, I compared technical specs, and the last thing I was thinking about the new camera was taking pictures under the water...

Houck", "ReviewID": "RE4NHG74BOGZX", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I bought this camera to replace a Cannon point and shoot. The touch screen turned out to be very intuitive. This camera takes pretty decent photos. It is not as good as my old Cannon, which got stolen. I do like the fact that it is waterproof and shock resistant etc. It has a number of settings which I particularly like. the backlight adjustment does a nice job when you are trying to get people and the background. The photo burst mode is quite good and has three speed settings. One thing I don't like is that you can not turn off the auto preview mode. Once you take a shot the camera displays it, thus wasting time until you can shoot again. Maybe it is possible to shut this off, but I haven't found it yet. Overall, I am quite satisfied with the camera in spite of the minor irritation of not being able to turn off the preview mode.", "Date": "August 10, 2010"}, {"Title": "Love this camera- perfect for a busy (somewhat clumsy?) mom of 3!", "Author": "J.

There have been several others since but this one is still great. We have used it in the pool as well as both fresh water and salt water snorkel trips. Sony says it is good to 10 feet although we have taken it down at least 15-20 and it has not had any issues. It has a setting for underwater image/video that does a good job or restoring the colors you usually lose underwater. The image quality of both pictures and video above and below the water is great for the side of the camera and on a full day charge with a 4GB memory card we have had no problems shooting all day. We have used it on the beach in the sand, in the mountains and snow, underwater and on land with zero issues in almost 3 years. Very happy.Not worth a star off but the only thing I can say negative about this camera is that when you are using it underwater, the screen is very hard to read and is more like a mirror, simple solution is to just have all your settings done before you go in the water and then just use the shutter button to start/stop recording or take pictures.", "Date": "June 12, 2013"}, {"Title": "Is as advertised", "Author": "CampinMama", "ReviewID": "R3F6F86WQ1I0E9", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I bought this camera about 3 years ago and am very happy with it. While the picture quality isn't as good as it was with my Sony CyberShot DSC-H3 or my Sony Cybershot DSC-W5 but I guess features come at a cost. It is DEFINITELY waterproof and I LOVED taking underwater pictures of the stingrays and reef sharks in the stingray \"petting\" tank at the zoo (till the attendant told me hands only :-) It is also very drop resistant. I have two grade school children who LOVE to take pictures...and also drop things. The touchscreen works flawlessly despite the fact that I not only don't use the stylus that came with but lost it a long time ago. The panorama feature is AWESOME and works beautifully. You really can't beat the price on this camera for all the features it offers. My only complaint is that the pink paint on the front slider is slowly chipping away over time but its gradually exposing a beautiful shiny silver finish underneath instead of that dull white plastic you usually get when paint starts coming off of things like this which is perfectly ok with me. All in all, a very good camera especially for the price.", "Date": "May 3, 2013"}, {"Title": "good camera", "Author": "Nate Wiggins", "ReviewID": "R2Q2VDC3GQP582", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "My wife likes the camera and that's all that matters.

It took great pictures on a beach vacation, and video too. I took VERY good care of it according to the manufacturer's directions. Upon return, following manufacturer's recommendations, I called to find out where to get it cleaned by a sony certified shop.  The lady told me it was under warranty, just send it in, they would be glad to do it for free.  Then they email a week later, the cover was missing and it would be over $200 to fix.  After 3 disconnected calls and three transfers, the \"highest\" up man said, \"sorry\".  They would rather lose my confidence, and hopefully yours too, than do the right thing.  The cover was NOT missing, it was a week old, sent in original packaging!  If it had been missing, I would have taken responsibility.  Sorry doesn't cut it Sony.  I would go with the Panasonic (and am going to as soon as I save enough money for ANOTHER camera, I shelled out more than I planned on this one thinking Sony would last a couple of years if I took care of it like I have the last 15 years with them!).  GO with Olympus or Panasonic, Sony doesn't care!
