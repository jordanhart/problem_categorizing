{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Fabulous image quality but less reach", "Author": "Roger J. Buffington", "ReviewID": "R1FX37T6YL2I03", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I have used both the TC-17E II and this one, the TC-14E II.  This one multiplies the reach of a zoom lens by only 1.4.  There are two other Nikon teleconverters in this series, the TC-17E II (1.7 multiplier) and the TC-20E II (2.0 times multiplier).  The \"E II\" series of teleconverters is only suitable for certain Nikon lenses--check the Nikon website for compatability.  I purchased this teleconverter for use with the 70-200VR F/2.8 lens, with which it is quite compatible.All teleconverters introduce at least a theoretical degradation in image quality in exchange for the extra reach; the extent of this can range from the unnoticeable to the significant.  The TC-14E II does not degrade the images from the 70-200VR to any perceptible extent.  Even when shooting with wide aperture settings this teleconverter does not appear to introduce any noticeable decrease in lens image quality.  Further, it only lowers the light sensitivity of a lens by one F Stop.  This means that a 2.8 lens will become a 4.0 lens when using this teleconverter--still pretty fast. The TC-14E II is noticeably sharper than the TC-17E II in lower light conditions requiring wider apertures (at the cost of less \"reach\" or magnification). I have been extremely impressed with the combination of the TC-14E II and the Nikon 70-200VR.  The magnification is significant, and the decrease in image quality is undetectable.Most Nikon afficianados seem to think that the 17E II is the best compromise between not too much image degradation and significant magnification, and I am inclined to agree with this, generally.  The charm of the 14E is that it really does appear not to exact any appreciable price in terms of image quality, and it is the only teleconverter I have ever used (or heard of) of which this can be said.  The qualities of the 14E II become evident when shooting in low light conditions, such as early morning wildlife shots.  When shooting flying birds, for instance, this TC is particularly useful, because it allows wider apertures, which may be required to allow the photographer to use faster shutter speeds to \"freeze\" the subjects and avoid motion blur.  Under such conditions, one appreciates the special qualities of the TC-14E II.Highly recommended.", "Date": "September 24, 2006"}, {"Title": "If You Want More Zoom and Minimal Distortion", "Author": "JME", "ReviewID": "R37AHTGNQWOAHH", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I bought this converter for the Nikon 70-200mm VR lens to cover extend my range when I upgraded from a D300 to a D3 and lost the 1.5x factor I had with the D300.

The results have been amazing. You will always need to use a tripod to avoid camera shake at this close distance, and on top of that don't take photos by pressing the button, as any slight movement will be magnified by an extra 1.4x - especially with a macro lens, so set the timer delay or better still use a remote or release cable. It takes practise getting crystal clear focus, so don't rely on auto focus at all. I always use aperture or shutter priority so that everything can be fine tuned manually.I contemplated getting either the TC-17E II (1.7x) or TC-20E II (2.0x) as well, but thought there was a possibility of too much image degradation. I stuck with the TC-14E II, and am really satisfied with it as there's always a trade-off between magnification and quality. The TC-14E II lowers the light sensitivity of a lens by just one F Stop, therefore an f2.8 lens turns into an f3.8 lens - which is still pretty fast for most purposes.Another real bonus of the TC-14E II comes when shooting in low light conditions. Allowing for wider apertures and faster shutter speeds, this enables subjects to be frozen so reducing motion blur.
