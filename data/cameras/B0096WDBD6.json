{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Great value for a compact DSLR alternative", "Author": "The Noise", "ReviewID": "R36Z1NFENTK6XM", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I am a photography amateur enthusiast. My other cameras are a Nikon D5100 and a D600 DSLRs with a range of lenses (prime and zooms). I've started shooting film back in early 90s on an old Nikon SLR.I also own a tiny pocket Canon ELPH HS300 point and shoot, which I wasn't really happy with. The pictures were rarely better than what I can take with my iPhone, at which point as small as the camera is, it's too big.I wanted something compact that could still take the breathtaking pictures my DSLR is capable of, and I spent a long time researching the best option. The main contenders were mirrorless cameras with largish sensors (for the form factor).Against a Fujifilm x100: I have to say Fujifilm's x100 (and the upcoming x100s) is a beautiful camera, I really like the retro look of it. It also features a great APS-C sized sensor on it, which makes for a great picture quality. The problem with this camera is the sluggish auto focus, which for a compact \"walk around\" camera is especially problematic (apparently the upcoming x100s is supposed to improve on this). It was also little pricey for what I wanted to spend.Sony RX100: Is a great little camera, which can take great photos. But I wanted something with a little bigger sensor and interchangeable lenses. You see I want to be able to invest the bulk of my money into lenses as no doubt the camera bodies become somewhat outdated every 2-4 years.And then I gave the Micro Four Thirds cameras a consideration. See the Micro Four Thirds is an open standard Olympus and Panasonic have created, where you can freely use all m4/3 lenses on any camera body. More companies are joining this alliance each month. As a result m4/3 cameras have the biggest selection of lenses of any mirorless camera competitor.It's exactly what this industry has needed for a long time. For companies to put an open standard together. No more vendor lock in and price gauging on lenses. Also you can be sure there will be long term support for this system as there appears to be quite a surge in popularity. More and more wedding photographers for instance are switching to this system, because of the ergonomics offered by much smaller and lighter gear required for all day shooting, as well as the selection of some really outstanding lenses for a decent price.Just on this alone, the choice for me was clear. All I had to do now is pick a micro four thirds camera.I've never used an Olympus camera before, but I've met photographers who have praised these cameras in the past. I read some reviews and researched the specs. I wanted compactness, and no need for a swivel screen.This narrowed the choice for me down to an E-PM2:- It uses the same sensor as the top of the line OM-D so technically capable of capturing the same quality images.- It is small and light.I really wasn't into the design of the camera, at first look I thought it was quite ugly, a more retro look would have been better, but that's just my taste. I have to say the look of the camera is growing on me though.I elected not to get the kit lens, and I went with the 20/1.7 LUMIX \"pancake\": Panasonic LUMIX G 20mm f/1.7 Aspherical Pancake Lens for Micro Four Thirds Interchangeable Lens Cameras lens (immediately taking advantage of the open standard!)So my first impressions after using this camera for a week (sorry for the long intro):Wow! In fact I am so impressed that I am actually thinking about selling my DSLR gear completely. I was little concerned that maybe I wouldn't like the native 4:3 aspect over the 3:2, but it turns out 4:3 is actually much more suited for portraits. In portrait mode it gives you more flexibility. Where it might lack is certain landscapes, but those can often be cropped to 3:2 without much loss in quality. I can't tell a difference in picture quality between this camera and my DSLR.Pros:- Autofocus. The speed at which this camera can auto focus and snap a photo is astounding. Way faster than my DSLR. In fact I thought the tap the screen to take a photo was a gimmick, but with such a fast AF, I find I am snapping twice as many photos than I normally do, and they are all in perfect focus. I was totally cough by surprise with how good snapping pictures feels with this camera, because of its responsiveness. There is a certain quality tactile feeling you get when you snap photos almost at the same time you touch the screen. A feature I didn't think I was going to use became my new favorite way of taking pictures. What's also great about it, if you're doing street photography, you don't even look like you're taking a photo. So your subjects are not distracted by it.- Image quality. I shoot raw. And I find photos have good dynamic range, which lets me do a lot with them when I post process in Lightroom. And I find even in low light I can take photos comparable to what I take with my DSLR.- Size. The camera is small and easy to cary, it fits in a jacket pocket, or a small bag. I can also now put it in my laptop case, and bring it to work with me.- Great UI As someone new to Olympus cameras, this was a concern. But I felt right at home with the user interface only after a few days of using the camera. I assigned the 'fn' key to my ISO settings, I shoot in Aperture Priority mode. Obviously this camera has much less dedicated buttons than the top of the line cameras, but I find E-PM2's buttons are sufficient for Aperture Priority style of shooting I do.- m4/3 availability of great lenses, with more 3rd parties announcing new products each month, it's truly exciting. Even things like pro cinema Black Magic camera coming out this year will feature an m4/3 mount. The adapters can be purchased for all sorts of lenses. In fact you can get a $31 C adapter and a CCTV lens RainbowImaging 35MM F1.7 TV Movie Lens + Lens Adapter for MFT M4/3 camera, fits Panasonic G1 G2 G3 G10 GF1 GF2 GF3 GH2 GH1 GH2, Olympus E-P1 E-P2 E-P3 E-PL1 E-PL2 which can let you create some very interesting effects/pictures. I've used my Nikon lenses on this camera and it works great. But the lack of focus peeking feature Sony cameras offer hinders this advantage somewhat.Cons:- None. Really, when it comes to price and what you get for it, I can't think of a single negative to say about this camera.Would like to see improved:- Manual focus. I haven't yet found the best way to take photos with adapted manual lenses. I have re-assigned my Rec button to let me zoom in. But its not ideal. Though this really can't be counted against the camera of this price, it would still be nice if it offered something like 'focus peaking' Sony cameras have. I think there is a way to use one of the Art filters to help with focus but its not ideal.- It's not a pretty camera. This might be just me. But would love a more retro (rangefinder look) at this price range. Like the OM-D without the rangefinder bulge would be beautiful. I went with the silver version. I would have liked the white version better if it didn't have the weird colored tan grip pad.Conclusion:One of the best buys in the category. You are not only buying a great camera but investing into a great system with great lens selection. You are also supporting an open standard in an industry dominated by proprietary lock-ins and price gauging.", "Date": "February 1, 2013"}, {"Title": "Review of the E-PM2 with comparison to other PEN series cameras", "Author": "Ken", "ReviewID": "R1GYZJ6OVB18C8", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "The Olympus E-PM2 is one of Olympus' 4th generation (digital) PEN series cameras. It shares the same sensor with the two other 4th generation PEN series cameras; the E-PL5 and OM-D. Not surprisingly, the image quality of each of these 4th generation PEN series cameras is almost identical.  The E-PM2 is really small and now includes a small grip making handling a bit easier. The camera body is the same size and weight as a smallish compact. The autofocus speed and high ISO image quality is unmatched by any other camera this small. The Olympus E-PM2 is one of very few cameras that can (auto) focus in total darkness, and it does so effortlessly (The Olympus OM-D, E-PL5 & all Nikon SLRs are really the only other cameras that can do this that I am aware).  The Menu system is not great on the E-PM2 and appears suited to those who like the camera to make most of the decisions. The E-PM2 is priced at less than half of the OM-D.  As such, it is a real bargain for very similar image quality.  Obviously the OM-D has many features and controls not found on the E-PM2 including a very good electronic viewfinder.I believe each of the PEN series cameras offer a remarkable balance of portability, automated/manual controls and high image quality.  It can be confusing though sorting through all the different yet similar cameras which now is in its fourth generationThe first three generation PEN series cameras essentially use the same sensor. Consequently, the image quality is similar especially for the first two generations (E-P1, E-PL1 & E-P2, E-PL2). One of the problems with the first two generation PEN series cameras is the lack of a focus assist infrared beam; auto-focusing is slow (and sometimes non-existent) in dim lighting. Also, the LCDs on the E-P1 & E-PL1 are not great.The E-PL1 & E-PL2 each have a built in flash; the E-P1 & E-P2 does not (nor does the 3rd generation E-PL3, E-PM1, nor 4th generation E-PL5 or E-PM2). The built in flash on the E-PL1 & E-PL2 have a great (undocumented) feature; the ability to 'bounce' the built in flash for a much nicer flash result similar to an (albeit weak) external flash.The third generation PENs (E-PL3, E-PM1, E-P3) finally included an infrared focus beam greatly improving auto-focus in dim lighting. The third generation used the same sensor as in previous PENs. However, there was a definite improvement (to the already good) color reproduction including automatic white balance presumably due to an updated .jpg processing engine (the raw files show less improvement). The color reproduction and automatic white balance on these third generation PEN cameras (especially at ISO 1600 and below and when using an external bounce flash) is as good as any camera I have ever used including very expensive DSLRs. Only the E-P3 of this generation has a built in flash but flash bounce capabilities have inexplicably been disabled on this flash.The fourth (latest) generation (E-PM2, E-PL5, OM-D) uses a new(16mp)sensor providing better resolution and better/faster auto-focusing especially in dim lighting conditions.  The real improvement is remarkably clean photos without much loss of detail at higher ISO settings. Although up until ISO 1600 the differences in noise levels are almost imperceptible, above ISO 1600 the E-PM2 (and O-MD) are in a class by themselves even compared to much more expensive cameras.  It is truly amazing.  Olympus includes incremental ISO settings between stops(ie ISO 2000) on all of their PEN models which is also helpful in not using a higher than needed ISO setting (Are you paying attention CANON & NIKON?).However, the E-PM2 (and EPL-5 & OM-D) takes a small step backwards from earlier PEN series cameras (especially the 3rd generation E-PM1, E-PL3 & E-P3) when  comparing color reproduction and white balance (especially in good light/base ISO settings). Also, The E-PM2 and E-PL5 do not have a built in flash (its not clear why such small cameras would require the use of an external flash).The included 14-42mm (28-84mm equiv) Kit lens is the same lens bundled with the 2nd and 3rd generation PEN series cameras and is similar (an ounce lighter) to the kit lens included in the first generation PEN series cameras. Other available kit lenses include the 17mm (34mm equiv) pancake prime lens and the 12-50mm (24-100mm equiv) lens included with the flagship O-MD.The 12-50mm (24-100mm equiv) lens included on the O-MD and available separately is a very versatile lens especially at wide angle. But its image quality is no better than the other kit lenses and it is about the twice the weight.  This heavier weight makes the lens unsuitable for the EPM-1 or E-PM2 cameras. The 17mm (34mm equiv) lens is really thin and light and turns any of these cameras (except the OM-D) into a true pocket camera.  The f/2.8 aperture is very bright and well suited to the earlier PEN series cameras.  Olympus consistently produces very sharp lenses capturing the finest details and each of these lenses are no exception.Which one to buy? Any of the PEN series cameras will not disappoint. The answer really depends on your needs and budget; If color reproduction and automatic white balance is most important consider the E-P3, E-PL3 or E-PM1. If really quick autofocus, higher resolution and using high ISO settings are important then the E-PM2, E-PL5 or OM-D would be a good choice. If price and a built in bounce flash is important, the E-PL1 or E-PL2.", "Date": "March 7, 2013"}, {"Title": "From a photo enthusiast's point of view", "Author": "GM", "ReviewID": "R19W98GUK2DI43", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "The Olympus E-PM2 camera, which I ordered for $100 off on black friday arrived. First things first: The quality of raw images of E-PM2 rivals many APS-C cameras, and it's the best in mu4/3 realm. Plus the camera is tiny compared to a DSLR. Does it deliver on the promises? Some thoughts after a month of use:Pros:* Low ISO images have certain depth and clarity that I only used to get with a DSLR (I've previously owned Canon DSLRs including Rebel Xti, 40D, 5dMkII).* Colors & auto white balance of images are pretty good. Rich yet natural.* Autofocus with Olympus 45mm f/1.8 is impressive. Initial acquisition is very fast in good light. Allows me to take pictures of our 1yr old toddler while he's on the move (mind you, he's not a sprinter).* The camera is pretty fast in high speed mode. Shot-to-shot blackout time is short. Writing on SD card is quick.* Touch-shutter works really well. I either use the center-point focus or touch shutter, both of which are fast and effective.* The camera itself is good looking compared to most alternatives (I ordered the white one).Cons:* User interface has a long way to go to become photographer friendly.  -- Changing the aperture in aperture-priority mode is inconvenient (dial only controls exposure compensation; changing aperture requires several button pushes).  -- Small fonts are difficult to read (especially ISO).  -- Settings like ISO, aperture, exposure time are not displayed in image preview, unless you go to the detailed view which shrinks the image to 1/4 size.* In low light, camera is slow to focus with my favorite Panasonic 20mm f/1.7; AF tends to hunt (Panasonic GF3 doesn't do that).* According to some web reviews & my experience, sensor-based image stabilization on E-PM2 is not effective. At best, gives half a stop to 1 stop improvement. Some says it's best to keep it off. That's what I do, after finding a few blurry images that shouldn't have been blurry based on shutter speed.* Clip-on flash makes it inconvenient to pocket even with prime lenses---Panasonic GF3/GF5 are a lot more pocketable.* JPGs at 100% view are disappointing in high ISO (very grainy). Raws are better.* Colors on LCD screen are way too warm compared to what I see in actual images on my calibrated monitor.The best features of E-PM2 are fast operation, fast AF in good light and best-in-class sensor. The images it produces are a notch above what I get from Panasonic GF3 in depth and clarity. On the down side, the user interface is clearly designed for the point-and-shoot user, not for the advanced amateur.  Do I recommend E-PM2? If you get a good deal on the price (like how it sells these days---$450/$500 for the body/kit) and if you don't mind its other, relatively minor, shortcomings, I do recommend it.=====================UPDATE:After discovering the extensive menu system, I was able to solve my main gripes with the user interface. Now I can use dial for controlling aperture. I can control the degree of noise reduction. I can turn off warm auto white-balance. There are a thousand other customizations you can make, which makes shooting a lot more fun. I'm very impressed by what Olympus offers here. The camera is nearly as capable as OMD (the $500 more expensive, 'pro' model) in a much smaller package. As for slowness of 20mm f/1.7 AF, I'd suggest checking out Panasonic 25mm f/1.4 (mine is on the way). It reportedly focuses a lot faster.", "Date": "December 8, 2012"}, {"Title": "Micro Four Thirds refined", "Author": "jppdx", "ReviewID": "R1Q6TD6A7LQFCU", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This is a review for the E-PM2 with the 14-42 kit lens- Amazing Auto-focus speed and accuracy.  It feels like a camera commercial or something.  In anything other than dim lights it's blazing.- Excellent image quality.  Impressed with the dynamic range and color at high iso numbers especially.- Touch screen focusing is better than I thought it would be.  Nothing about this camera feels gimmicky or poorly done.- Feels like a $500 camera in terms of build quality (in a good way).  By this I mean everything seems tight and well constructed but it is clearly not an OM-D or a professional SLR.  Nor should it be as this would raise the price.- Interface as a whole was a pleasant surprise and much better than my E-PL1. I do not miss the mode dial as the touch screen replaces that for me.  In P/A/S modes the quick access panel (brought up by OK button) is great!!!  Faster setting changes than my E-PL1 or a previous Pentax K-x DSLR.- Great Flash metering as well.  This part seems much improved over the E-PL1 as well.CONS:It seems like Olympus could have put a soft AE-lock button on the screen.  Another dial would be nice of course but probably outside of scope of the camera.  No on camera flash but I am not sure there is room for one.  Image stabilization good for about 1 stop (I am guessing) which is useful but something to consider when comparing this to its much more expensive brother the OM-D or even something like an RX100.SUMMARY:My first impression is a stunning upgrade from the E-PL1 to E-PM2.  Looks larger in photos than it feels in my hands (almost too small).  Compared to other cameras I have owned I think it has 90% of the image quality of a Pentax K-x and it blows away an E-PL1 (which I have taken excellent photos with).  Focus speed is incredible.  It felt more like a semi-pro DSLR with a fast prime lens than anything else. Kit lens is a little softer than the best glass I have owned (obviously) but not really a detriment to general photography.  It is certainly a sharper kit lens than my Pentax 18-55 was.I differ with some professional reviews and some other user reviews regarding usability.  I thought given it's lack of physical controls and overall size it is very usable.  The quick settings in P/A/S modes cover most everything you would commonly need to change on the fly.  I was worried that it would be a glorified point and shoot (in terms of control and usability) and I now have a very different opinion.  I also don't see how an EPL-5 is much of an upgrade unless you need an articulating screen.Best camera body I have ever owned!!  Not sure why some professional reviewers did not care for the camera much.  True DSLR image quality in a tiny package with excellent performance.  The biggest competitor in my mind is actually the RX100 which is much smaller with excellent image quality.  I decided I wanted the ultimate image quality and flexibility of a this CSC and I have not regretted it once.", "Date": "January 9, 2013"}, {"Title": "Sweet little camera, great price, just a few minor glitches.", "Author": "Michael W. Heinz \"award-winning bozo\"", "ReviewID": "RGCFS6UB9U3PR", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I've been wanting to compare a Micro 4/3rds camera against my DSLR for years. After my daughter managed to fall off a mountain, (destroying a Nikon D60 in the process) I decided to bite the bullet and replace it with something smaller.So far I've taken the camera on one extended photo shoot, and my daughter has taken it to the Philadelphia Flower Show, so these are my initial impressions:Pros:* In bright light the images are easily as sharp as those taken with my Nikon D5100.* This camera is amazingly light and small! It's about 1/3 the size and 1/4 the weight of my D5100, while offering a wider zoom.* The UI offers just about every control you might want, from scenic modes to full manual.* Focus has been fairly fast and sure.* I can't emphasize this enough - the camera is just fun to use. It's a real throw back to small rangefinder cameras of the 60s and 70s.Cons:* When shooting JPG, reds can be over-saturated. This isn't the only camera I've had this problem with, but it does mean you'll want to shoot raw when you're shooting roses or other red flowers.* The 40-150 zoom lens. is not as sharp as the 14-42.* The zoom mechanism on the 40-150 is quite stiff.

I also don't know if the readers of this review are professional photographers or amateurs who are stepping up from point & shoot cameras.  I'll keep this brief, for now, and try to make it so everyone can understand.If you're a P&S; user and never plan to buy lenses, there are many cameras I would choose before buying this one (this PM2, BTW, is no different than the OM-D e-M5 minus weather sealing, convenient buttons, viewfinder, and 5-axis IBIS stabilization [PM2 is 2-axis]).  The Olympus XZ-2, for example, gives you zoom, wide angle, a fast lens (f1.8 I believe at its widest), a flash, a hot shoe, good image quality, small size, $500 price tag, and the benefit of knowing you'll never have to buy anything else.  The Sony RX100, Nikon P7700 (or its little brother the P330), Canon G15 (or s110), or Panasonic LX7 are also great choices.  In fact, the lenses on those cameras are just as good as the 14-42mm (28-84mm equivalent lens that comes with the PM2) in terms of speed (faster, actually), wide angle, zoom, and sharpness.  Yes, better cameras all around.  Smaller.  Cheaper.  Yes.  Better.  And I repeat that to let you know that I'm not joking.  And for those of you who say, \"ISO or shallow depth of field performance on the PM2 is better\" then to you I say you're right, and you're probably beyond the P&S; crowd (and should probably consider a lens other than the 14-42mm kit lens which is only f3.5-5.6).In defense of my above claims, take the fact that professional photographers who own say, a full frame Nikon D800e with several thousands of dollars of lenses would most likely never buy a Micro Four Thirds (m4/3s) camera such as the PM2.  Why?  The D800 will beat it in every category except for size and price and when said pro photographer wants something small that he doesn't have to lug around, he'll likely get something like the cameras mentioned above that he can throw in his pocket and solve all his problems in a small $500 package.  The PM2 is too big to wear on your waist and this pro will spend his money on Nikon lenses and won't want to deal with buying a flash, viewfinder, lenses, etc for a totally different camera system.(Warning, this paragraph is technical.  Summary in next paragraph.) So, why did I buy this camera?  Because the D800 type cameras are too big for me and the lenses are too expensive.  How much better is the D800 than the Micro Four Thirds PM2?  Well the sensor has 400% the surface area  Noise?  I haven't compared the two sensors but others have and the 1-2 stop advantage seems about accurate.  Now, the D800 has 36MP to the PM2's 16MP which is about a 145% increase in size either vertically (225% increase in total resolution).  Downsized, yes, the lack of noise of the Nikon will beat the PM2 by 2-3 stops (this number would be halved if the OM-D e-M5's 5-axis stabilization came into play).  Large pixels on larger sensors have dynamic range benefits as well, but each pixel on the D800e is not 400% the size of those on the PM2, rather, with the D800's higher pixel count, it's more like 200%.  That said, the D800e is the best camera for professional photographers (Sigma Merrill cameras can definitely compete in bright light, however, and I'm not even going to discuss PhaseOne.  EDIT: the Nikon DF should beat the D800e at low-noise in high-ISO situations).To summarize the above, ISO 6400 on a Nikon D800 downsized to 16MP will look approximately as good as ISO 1600 on the PM2 (plus increases in dynamic range).  And to me, that's good enough.  Also, then, why didn't I buy one of the P&S; cameras mentioned in the second paragraph?  Because all things equal, the noise level of the ISO 6400 shot on the D800 would need to be ISO 200 on the P&S; cameras (with the exception of the Sony).  And since I often shoot in low-light, I need higher ISOs.  Those cameras would be good for me only in brighter situations.  Enough about the sensors.  Next is the lensesIf you want the perfect combination of image quality, small size, low price, and low-light performance, the PM2 + Panasonic 20mm f1.7 solves every one of those problems.  The lens is $350, f1.7 is fast, it's sharp, and it's very small and lightweight and can hang off my waist.  That versus the P&S; cameras I mentioned, I lose only zoom and a built-in flash.  I rarely use flash unless if I'm out with friends and in that situation I would probably take a cheap $99 P&S; camera anyway.  If I don't need the small size Panasonic makes constant aperture 7-14mm f4, 12-36mm f2.8, and 35-100mm f2.8 lenses can be had new for $1000 each.  Olympus makes 12, 17, 45, and 75mm f1.8 primes that are all very sharp, fast lenses ($4-900).  With an adapter the PM2 can use any number of the dozens of the \"legacy lenses\" from decades ago, many of them being very good, notably the 50mm f1.4 lenses that can be had used for around $50.  There are a couple dozen more lenses made for m4/3s as well.CONS: And to review the camera itself, I'll keep it to the cons and why I only gave it 4/5 stars.  I obviously know my cameras and chose this based on its features.  This is the smallest interchangeable lens camera that gives me the quality I want.  I can think of a few things I don't like about it, however: plastic body, too small of a grip to easily hold any lens over 300g, no built-in flash, charger has isn't the simple box type rather it has an annoying long cord, needs a few more buttons, scroll wheel a bit too sensitive, as with all mirrorless cameras, the shutter stays open while you're changing lenses, no in-camera HDR bracketing or panorama combining function, and maybe a few other minor things.  I'm sure I'll update this review as time goes on.", "Date": "June 12, 2013"}, {"Title": "The spirit of m43", "Author": "Bob \"Bob\"", "ReviewID": "R1NYKIRXXGF7QU", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "This camera best captures the spirit of Micro Four Thirds. That is, you get a small camera but with Big Sensor quality. And when I mean Big Sensor, not only is it physically large (though, of course, a slight bit smaller than APS-C), it also has big image quality, the same as the much more expensive E-M5 and E-P5, and WAY better than the Panasonic GF5 (which Panasonic has already replaced with a newer model).So why only give it 4 stars? The following things annoy me: no built-in level, the LCD is small and inferior (only 460K dots is subpar these days), the IBIS (that's the in-body image stabilization) is flaky and will occasionally blur your photos instead of making them sharper and that's a very annoying bug and it's recommended you keep IBIS turned off when you don't need it, or always take two photos of each subject when it's turned on if you want to make sure you captured at least one sharp photo. The IBIS problem is primarily why I demote this to 4 stars and might even consider 3 stars.The purple fringing also annoyed me, until I discovered on the internet that if you put a Tiffen Haze 2A filter in front of the lens, it makes the purple fringing go away.The kit lens is a very good lens, very sharp even to the corners when stopped down to f9 (that's my preferred f-stop, except at 14mm where that's probably too much stopping down). But it's cheap on the part of Olympus not to include the lens hood (which is just a piece of plastic and probably costs a few cents to manufacture).The best lens to use with this camera is the Olympus 17mm f/1.8 for it's small size and excellent image quality and hardly ever a purple fringe to be seen even if you are not using the recommended Haze 2A filter.", "Date": "July 14, 2013"}, {"Title": "Best Budget Micro Four Thirds Body.  IQ is Excellent!", "Author": "Perry", "ReviewID": "R3TPQNP2ER04KE", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "About a week ago I reviewed the E-PL3 and while that was a good camera,  the in body IS failed me so, I found an E-PM2 for only a few bucks more.  Again, to me the Image Quality is key and tools that help build upon that Image quality are also a big boost to the overall body.LOOKS AND BUILD QUALITY  The Olympus E-PM2 is a decent body but, it doesn't quite feel as solid as the E-PL3. To me, that's the only negative of the body when comparing the two.I feel the styling of this camera is considerably better than the E-PL3 as it features a small rubber grip on the front and back to rest your hand for shooting.I have only one real issue with this body, and that's that the AF Assist Light is still in a place where it can be obstructed by your left index finger.TOUCH SCREENThis screen works well and allows you to toggle between touch to focus, touch to shoot, and off.  This is big as you will accidentally take pictures if you're not careful with the body.Overall, the capacitive touchscreen works well and it really adds to the appeal of the camera.METERING  This is another improvement over my E-PL3, it appears to be spot on in any scenario I've used it in and that makes for predictable control of your exposure!  I'm very pleased with this aspect of the camera.AF SYSTEM  The AF System is very fast for this type of camera and I have to say that Olympus really stepped up here given the fact that the earlier bodies were known for having slow AF.  Accuracy also seems to be fairly good so, no real issues with the focusing at all.  This seems to be pretty much identical to the E-PL3 in terms of performance.IMAGE STABILIZATION  I've used just about every image stabilization system around and honestly, I am still not 100% impressed with the Olympus Sensor Shift.  The cameras sensor is very forgiving and the exposure is top notch so, this isn't as big an issue as it was in the E-PL3.  Basically, the 2 stops better Image Quality gives you much more flexibility for getting sharp clean shots so, the ISO Crutch doesn't actually hurt the finished product.MENUING SYSTEM  The camera itself is equipped with a touchscreen and lacks a mode dial...  This means that the menu structure has actually changed from the other bodies.  Yes, there are still too many menus associated with too many buttons but, they're better presented now and the touchscreen helps you to navigate them pretty easily.My only wish is that this whole touch screen experience was more like a smart phone in that you could easily flick up and down the menus but, instead it is more like a feature phone where you have fixed arrows on the screen for scrolling through the menus.AESTHETICS  The best things about this camera are the color and white balance reproduction.  There's a certain look to Olympus photos that are really hard for others to replicate.  Canon images are too yellow, Nikon's are too Red, Sony's are just plain bland (high quality but nothing special for color) and yet, Olympus just seems to pull off the perfect balance of the bunch.  The second best thing is the increased quality of High ISO Shooting.  This is very impressive and I've taken shots at ISO 5000 that are very usable for certain size prints.If you're looking for a reason to buy this camera, these are the best reasons going for it!IMAGE QUALITY  No confusion here, Image quality is top notch and you really cannot ask for more than this little body delivers!  Clean ISO 1600 helps reduce the number of throw away shots I've had as I'm now better able to handle the camera with reduced shake thanks to the ISO Crutch that the In Body Image Stabilization uses.CONCLUSION  After spending just a few sessions with this body, I am sure, this is the body I'm going to build my system around!  I am very pleased over all with the way the body performs and how much of an improvement it is over my E-PL3.Overall, I like the camera because I like the Image Quality and I feel that Olympus really did a stellar job correcting most of the issues of their last gen bodies.  Really, really pleased with the body!Would I recommend this body?  Yes!  It doesn't matter who you are, you should be able to get a good well focused, well exposed, stabilize image from this camera with little to no effort!  This simply put, is the best budget Micro Four Thirds camera available.  I would love to give that designation to Panasonic but, there's just too many features missing from those bodies.", "Date": "April 12, 2013"}, {"Title": "Good camera, but not worth investing in lenses!  (REVISED REVIEW)", "Author": "nnyms", "ReviewID": "R3V69J6ZLA916W", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "***Please note that the below review has evolved since my initial purchase and subsequent sale of the E-PM2.***I am not disappointed at all with the price/performance of the E-PM2.  I got it from an Amazon Marketplace seller on sale for $499 and I sold the bundled lens on Ebay for $119 because I prefer prime lenses--new and latest generation, best image quality Olympus has to offer in a digital camera, for $380 net of sold lens.What I like about the new E-PM2--Great low light abilities.  Pics at ISO 3200 are still good.--Touch screen controls are quick.  I find I can work the controls on this camera faster than the E-PL3 I previously owned.--Focuses better and faster than the previous generation PEN.--Includes a little grip on the front.  Makes handling camera much better.I have previously owned Canon APS-C DLSR equipment and had purchased some high end L lenses.I soon found that my favorite pics were using a 50mm f/1.2, shooting without flash, indoors and wide open most of the time.I sold my Canon gear a couple years back and decided due to financial and social constraints, I needed a far less expensive camera that had to be small so it would not annoy people, and could still take beautiful pictures.I read loads of great things about the new Olympus 45mm f/1.8 lens, but was hesitant with micro 4/3's due to the sensors lagging behind their APS-C cousins.  Not wanting to wait any longer, there were some crazy inexpensive deals on the Olympus E-PL3 during the summer.  I sold the kit lens, which by the way is good, and started shooting with the 45mm attached.  I got some great photos, but as many of the shots I take are in low light, I was often let down by the 12MP sensor on the E-PL3.  The high ISO capabilities showed  too much noise at anything higher than ISO 800.I was very pleased when I saw the OMD E-5 hit the market cause I knew its lower priced siblings would soon be on their way.Bottom line is the E-PM2 can take photographs that look like more than just snapshots, and deserve to be called portraits.  Remember, it is not just the camera, but the lens you put on it that makes the whole package.  While the $399 45mm f/1.8 lens is great, it is not in the same class as the $1,600 Canon 50mm f/1.2, but I cannot justify the $1201 difference.  As for image quality, at 16mp of near perfection for the price, you would need an immensely more expensive full frame DSLR  and/or professional quality full-frame DSLR lenses to substantially improve your photos.If you want compact and quality, Micro 4/3's is a much better size over any APS-C format camera, and the Micro 4/3's camp have hands-down the best selection of lenses out there for mirror-less cameras.For me, there is no other choice if you are looking for an inexpensive camera and interchangeable lens system.  PEN E-PM2 gets 5 stars from me.*****REVISION*****I have been using the camera on-the-go lately.  Have to say it is hard to get an in-focus shot of faster moving subjects--kids.  Yes, I am using a thin-depth-of-field at f/1.8, but even my old crop-sensor 8mp Canon DSLR from 2007 did better in continuous focus.  Still love the form factor.  Look forward to further improvements in mirror-less camera focusing.  Will still leave 5-stars because this camera is NOT a DSLR.  if you need DSLR features, then, for now, it is still only a DLSR can that deliver.***As of July 8, 2013 - With the Olympus E-PL5 now at $499 and the E-PM2 at $424, I would recommend the E-PL5******Sept 11, 2013 - I am now looking forward to the OMD E-1's lower priced siblings so I can have a PEN with PDAF.  Increasingly frustrated by inability to shoot moving targets with the E-PM2.  Have flirted with the idea of getting a DSLR (like a refurb Nikon D3200 with a Nikon 35mm f1.8 for under $600!), but cannot justify two cameras and want to stay small.Sold my E-PM2 and bought a niche large sensor fixed lens camera.  I will sell it when PDAF hits the PEN series (or any high quality compact camera, noting the Nikon 1 series is not good enough and has too small a sensor for my taste).  Waiting for when I can finally have an all around camera in a small form.9/11/13-- 1 star instead of the previous 5 because, simply put, I am not excited anymore about the E-PM2.  Still a very good camera.12/9/13--There have been some crazy low prices on this camera.Final words:  the 45mm f/1.8 is a great lens but too telephoto for all round use.  Seeing as the only quality lens in the normal focal length rangeis the Leica 25mm F1.4 at about $529, that pushes up the cost of M43 for a shooter like me who would be happy to keep a 50mm equivalent lens on my camera all the time.  In short, a 16mp PEN M43 camera with a prime 50mm equiv will costs about $800+.  There are a lot of choices at that price point.Good luck deciding!!!All I really needed was a 25mm prime for my E-PM2, but refused to pay $529 for a \"Leica\" lens that will likely never be capable tracking a moving target. All the talk about investing in a system and how \"superior the Micro 4/3's selection and line-up of lenses\" is, but no one is talking about how the current generation of lenses (not just Olympus and Panasonic) for mirror-less cameras will likely be replaced by better continuous auto focus performing lenses in the near future.", "Date": "December 1, 2012"}, {"Title": "Nice little gem", "Author": "pkc", "ReviewID": "RKMWX58O5HVRG", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I have upgraded from EPL1 to EPM2 for my new born. So far, I'm very satisfied. It is surprising that not much review on this camera compare other similar camera (ie. EPL5, Sony NEX3F, Panasonic G1x). In my opinion, people have overlooked this little gem.What I like E-PM2 so far:Great low light capability: Good quality picture with ISO1600 and up to ISO3200 is acceptable.Fast AF: I main use it with the panny 14mm F2.5 lens. The AF is fast for in-door and kids movement.Great WB: the auto white balance is great for both in-door and out-door. The Jpeg direct output is great.Light weight and easy to grip. My wife used to complain about the EPL1 weight (don't ask me why). With EPM2, she didn't complain any more. The EPM2 with the panny 14mm lens is a good combo for the weight, size as well as fast AF as mentioned on above. However, when I attach it with my Olympus 14-140mm lens, the overall weight balance and feel is still very good.Low cost: Compare to E-PL5 and E-M5 which has the same sensor.Comments:Good user control interface and fast respond: In the beginning, I was hesitating it doesn't have the mode dial. However, the touch screen is easy to use. I didn't miss the mode dial. Of course, make sure the SCP (super control panel) is on as well as others Olympus camera. Also, the respond is fast and smooth.The body is made in high-quality plastic. I would prefer metal but it is not a big deal at all.What I like for improvement:There are no built-in flash light. Even though it provides the attached flash, it is just more handy and complete if it comes with the built-in one.E-PM2 has the HDR and panorama feature. However, it doesn't process in the camera.

The only disadvantage I can see for my type of shooting is that the mysets are difficult to access compared to the e-pl5.

A comparable 50mm for my Nikon is $150.  One reason I bought the camera was to supplement my 17mm pancake lens, but buying the lens alone is ridiculously priced for a kit lens.Overall I love the convenience, handling, picture quality and even focus speed.

The only problem is with phones being the go-to source for taking pictures due to their convenience I didn't want a point and shoot, I wanted something that would be an upgrade but still give me more options than my smartphone. Now, I am no expert photographer so I didn't need to spend tons of money on an expensive camera because I don't use it daily but I love this because it is small enough to fit in my purse comfortably (in its case) but still have the option for interchangeable lenses.

I use auto-focus mostly but am learning to take control of things myself. I bought a used D50 a few years ago and had lots of fun with it. I was mostly annoyed with its size. It was cumbersome in many situations but took really nice shots.This E-PM2 unit is half of the size and really easy to use. I received it the day before a 10-day trip back home to Georgia. I didn't have time to read the manual before taking my first shot. I went through the menu to be sure I was using the largest file size and changed the default 4:3 setting to 16:9. Be sure to change that setting if you want widescreen shots!Snapping shots was a breeze and quite fast. The one-touch video button is great for catching 1080p .mov files quickly and easily without having to fumble through menu selections. No more missing the opportunity for a great video.

Image quality from the kit lens might seem ordinary at first, but the camera does render excellent color even from JPEGs (this is where I got most compliments, the colors of the JPEGs output). Autofocus is superfast and super quiet, unlike the Sony NEX-5. Even in dim light, with the kit lens (shot at the widest aperture available), autofocus is fast thanks to the illuminator. I've been shooting more with the Olympus prime 45mm f1.8 recently, and image quality is superb. I bought this lens for ~$300 from a Japanese Amazon retailer. With that lens I don't even carry my flash around any more. Color is warm, bokeh is splendid, and overall a great purchase. If you're used to shooting prime, I might even suggest skipping the kit lens and getting the 17mm 1.8 with the 45mm 1.8 - otherwise Panasonic has other lens choices that are compatible with Olympus too, as long as they're all micro 4/3. But considering the kit lens is included in the bundle for such a small difference in price, might as well get it. The kit lens is not bad shooting in day light, but if you don't plan on purchasing any additional lens, it's probably better investing in a more high-end (fixed-lens) compact, like the Sony RX-100 or Canon S120.As for which PEN to get, the E-PM2 has the 16MP sensor from the OM-D-E5, which is significantly better than the E-P3. E-PM2 and E-PL5 have similar specs, but the E-PL5 has a tilting LCD and mode dials, which I figured I can live without, but we'll see if I regret that decision. In my opinion it's better to invest more heavily in lenses, as it seems like the micro 4/3 line is improving steadily, and new bodies with newer sensors will make their way to the market in the future. I figured in a few years I could get a new body with a better sensor but retain all of my lenses.

Way better for stills than Nex 3n", "Author": "uzevla", "ReviewID": "R3INYNRZR2O2UW", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "First of all, the video is some 5 years behind. Continuous autofocus is slow (face tracking for pictures is perfect on the other hand). Beside that, the quality of video is very low. There is tracking focus during video but no way to say to what to track during the shooting. Ridiculous.You might want to skip this camera if you have kids and want video. If you don't mind that, this is 4-5 stars camera (I guess 5 considering the price and considering Nex 3N is a toy comparing to this).About the LCD and the body shape: 4:3 output on a 16:9 LCD results in approximately 2.3\" viewing space. That's not even enough to see if your picture is in the focus (of course I can see the picture after the shot is taken but I do it only during the preview - I don't have time to spend on analyzing pictures while the action is on). On the good side, in 16:9 output, the picture fills the screen which is not the case with Nex 3N. Anyway, native size LCDs, even the cheap ones (e.g. Canon S110) are 10x better than this one - you can simply see your picture much better.Now, I understand Olympus wanted this body shape as it helps with marketing the camera as a small one. So essentially, they are just following the same gimmick Sony started. If they added just 5mm to the height that would allow for a better grip, integrated flash and at least 3:2 LCD. That would be a real camera at no additional cost (money or bulk). Since I use the flash all the time, that would allow me to buy and use the viewfinder. I wouldn't need a better 2nd camera than this one (maybe even the 1st one considering this new panasonic 12-32mm lens together with the 20mm f1.7 one). Since they wanted to follow gimmick trends from Sony, I gave them 3 stars.Now, if you plan to use this camera with the original kit lens, hanging around your neck (as it can't fit a belt pouch), there is not much debate - it's a way cheaper than anything else on the market and you should get it. The menus are quick to access and much more usable than e.g. Nex 3N (and that's even without the touchscreen). It's just much more serious camera than Nex 3n. After all, this kit lens is light years ahead of that one on the Nex 3N. And not to forget, flash is three times more powerful.Update: originally gave it 3 stars but updated it to 4.

If you find yourself wanting to set ISO and Aperture and Shutter speed etc, this is not the best camera.The OOC Jpegs are very good and full of pleasant colors.

LR 4 and LR 5 are very good programs, but OV3 just edges them out in terms of color and detail. An advanced user could do more with LR I suppose, but for a novice OV3 is your best bet.The camera bag is a perfect fit for the kit lens, or any prime lens, but will not work with and telephoto zoom. The bag is very small, you will only be able to carry the camera, and the lens that is attached to it, you cannot bring a second lens with the bag.

Pick up whatever lens you like, because it is the lenses that really take the best pictures.Also remember it is the photographer that takes a good picture.

It is definitely good and shoots larger photos than my DSLR (5yo Canon Rebel), but the color isn't as spot-on. That can be corrected by fiddling with settings, but out of the box it's just not as accurate. Also, I find the photos to be grainier than expected as the ISO is stepped up. I'm attempting to avoid this by keeping the ISO low. Unfortunately, when set to Auto, I find it jumps up the ISO way too early (1600+ is just too grainy unless it's very dark).The image stabilization is honestly pretty hard to even notice. I use a Nokia Lumia 920 with OIS that blows the PEN out of the water in low-light situations. I'm told in-lens IS will yield better results so when purchasing other lenses in the future I'll look for that.Happily there are many settings like bracketing, gradation, the function button, and custom white balance that help alleviate most of the issues I run into. Overall the benefits - primarily compactness and flexibility - outweigh the negatives.

Well in my opinion it has exceeded my expectations particularly regarding its image quality. I have a Canon 5d full frame 12mb camera that I made some IQ comparisons and I was amazed at how close the E pm2 came to the image quality of the full frame 5d. The most critical comparison was the low light results where I compared results achieved with both cameras at ISO 3200. The Canon 5D still edged out the E PM2 but only by a very narrow margin. I also have a EPL1 which was also compared to the Canon 5D and the E PM2 and it was clearly in the minor leagues in image quality when compared to these two. For this comparison I used the Panasonic 20mm 1.7@ f4.0 on the Olympus cameras and the Canon 24-70L @ 40 mm f4.0. on the 5D. In bright outdoor conditions the image quality was practically identical between the Canon 5d and the E PM2 with the EPL1 still behind but not as much as in the low light comparison. Also the auto focus was super fast and accurate and the fast 8 frames per second was amazing for a camera at this price point.But lets put all this in proper perspective, when I tested all of these cameras in comparison to my Canon 5D MarkII  it was no real contest for image quality in either low light or bright outdoors illumination.The reason for my four star rating rather than a 5 star was the navigation within the menu system. When trying to view images that had been just taken, the controls where \"nervous\" in their execution. Selections using the dial  was imprecise and jumpy. Although this was a problem while viewing previous shots overall the camera in the shooting modes worked perfectly.The small size of the camera and lenses made it a possible for me to carry  the Olympus 9-18mm the 14-42mm and the Panasonic 20mm 1.7 and 45-200mm ,the digital VF and flash all in a 61/2\" X 6\" x 3\" shoulder bag.

This camera, perhaps with an additional longer lens, would be a clear choice to take on vacation.I have two different kinds of cameras... dSLRs and compacts.  The dSLRs (and available accessories) while somewhat bulky are very responsive and take great pictures under a wide range of situations.  Compact cameras are convenient but have a narrower range of acceptable conditions.I was curious if these new fangled 4/3 format cameras in general and this model in particular could somehow bring together the best of those two worlds.  I was lucky enough to be able to borrow  an E-PM2 for a few months and amazed at just how well it worked.For me, the big pluses are: - Quick (SLR-like) shutter response.  However, what I've found at least as useful is... - A very fast rapid shutter.  Shooting at eight frames per second means I can catch my daughter at the exact instant her eyes are open, her smile is wide and bright, and she is mid-air while running.  I even have a chance of catching her in one of those fleeting moments when she is posing and not looking like a goof. - Fast focus.  Certainly faster than I'm used to with compact cameras and comparable to the speed for a moderately priced dSLR and lens. - It captures images in jpeg and raw.Other great features include: - Long battery life.  I was taking 500 shots without having to recharge. - Auto did a great job of figuring out what I wanted. - Available Scene modes were easy to identify and select. - Manual adjustments... Frankly, I didn't need them.  The included scene modes equate to most useful manual combinations and they're easier to use. - The included lens is great; sharp and with almost no distortion. - Impressive low light performance. - The \"touch shutter\" is very handy.  I tap the display where my subject is and the camera (quickly) focuses on that spot and snaps the shutter.  A pair of convenient finger notches make it easy to steady the camera with my right hand so my left is free to tap as needed. - There are also the bundle of other features like blink warning, auto select the best of 5, and wink to trigger the shutter. - I can access all camera functions with either the touch screen or real buttons. - The flash is removable.  I can leave it off (the camera) to make it more compact, leave it on the camera, use a larger flash instead, or even a radio trigger if I choose.Nice features about this \"class\" of camera - It's easy to carry.  It is small enough to fit into a jacket pocket. - The lens is replaceable.  (I'm not talking about interchangeable, which is true as well.)  A problem with any compact camera is the lens is attached to the camera body.  They are also the most \"mechanical\" part of the camera.  Two questions, what's the first thing that usually breaks?  What's the most expensive thing to have fixed?  Not only is the lens simpler but if something should go wrong it is easy to fix.  For a few hundred dollars you get another.  Not cheap but more so than replacing the entire camera. - The lenses are interchangeable.  That *can* result in better pictures.  There is a law in physics dealing with optics that says, \"the more stuff you have a lens do the worse it's gonna do it.\"  (I'm paraphrasing here.)  All things being equal, being able to use several lenses, each that for example covers part of a wide zoom range, instead of a single lens means you'll spend less and get better optics.", "Date": "January 10, 2013"}, {"Title": "This gives big bag for the buck", "Author": "Alfred R.

Good job Olympus!Just a bit about how tough this little camera can be:  I fell of some rocks into a pool of water with this camera attached to my spider holster on my waist.  It got completely submerged for about 10 seconds.  The lens was full of water (20mm panny) and the camera refused to do anything.  I removed the lens, and there was water on the sensor.  The LCD was obviously wet under the screen.  After opening all 'doors' and leaving the lens off and using a hair dryer to force air into the camera every couple of hours being careful not overheat it, on the second day it turned on but no LCD.  On the third day the LCD started to come back to life but had a 'smeared' image.  At this point the camera would take pictures.  Another day of blow drying every few hours and the camera returned to normal operation.  I had to clean the sensor and there is still one small spot that shows up in the sky that I routinely clone out with PSE but the camera works fine.  This happened about a year ago in April 2013 2 weeks before my hip replacement.  The camera still works, in fact I used it on a hike today.

It abruptly ended after 20+ pages and then started over in another language]. This wasn't a deal breaker - I just downloaded the full manual in .PDF form and put it on my iPAD. The camera comes with a slide-on flash which I haven't used, so I can't really comment on it. I found that using a large telephoto lens like my Panasonic 100-300mm was kinda shaky looking because I had to hold the screen up high enough to see the image so I purchased the VF-3 slide-on viewfinder which solved that [I spent under $300 for the body and didn't want to spend almost as much for the VF-4 viewfinder. I've found the VF-3 to work just fine].

(see a link to a video example in the Comments following this review)However, two factors have together prompted me to increase my rating from 3 stars to 4, because this effect can be negated by using certain Panasonic lenses instead of Olympus lenses.  Several Panasonic lenses have switchable lens OIS, meaning you can turn off the camera's IBIS and use the lens Optical Image Stabilization (OIS). In addition, I have discovered that in both the E-PM2 and E-PL5, Olympus has now added a menu item to allow IBIS to be turned off and lens OIS to be turned on (for lenses that have OIS) even if they lack an external OIS on/off switch. (All previous Olympus PEN M43 cameras do not have a method of turning lens OIS on unless the lens has an external swtich.)This being the case, it is possible to use a wide variety of Panasonic lenses with this body and, using OIS, achieve top notch video results. Unfortunately, this means you must spend extra money to purchase OIS lenses, and it leaves some very fine Olympus lenses relegated to stills photography only, which is a shame.Nonetheless, given that excellent video can be had with the proper lenses, I am increasing my rating to 4 stars from the original 3, as this is truly otherwise a camera that produces exceptional still images and video, with the right lens.  If the camera's IBIS gave good video results with Olympus lenses, I would absolutely give this camera a 5-star rating.Original 3-star review:I have been scouring the web for reviews and evaluations of the video mode in the new E-PM2 and E-PL5 models, trying to ascertain if the new sensor that these cameras share with the OM-D has solved the wobbly \"jelly\" or \"jello\" effect that the E-PM1 and E-P3 exhibited, or whether Olympus has adjusted the digital image stabilization in videos to reduce or eliminate this effect.I have not yet seen this issue addressed in any review of either of these cameras on Amazon, and so far all the reviews I've found on the web have been focused on the still photography functionality of these cameras.Finally today I found this video comparing the Image Stabilization of the OM-D vs the E-PL5.  Note that the sensor and IS system of the E-PM2 is the same as the E-PL5, and the results shown here are the same as if taken by the E-PM2.As you can see, Olympus has not solved the problem.I hope this information is useful to those of you who, like me, are evaluating either of these cameras for video use.You can find the video at web dot photodex dot com/view/ma2bw28I will also leave a link in the Comments of this review.", "Date": "January 16, 2013"}, {"Title": "Great camera.", "Author": "Carole Blatchley", "ReviewID": "RF24DFUOHO7AD", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Great camera and service.

I bought this camera because my wife and I took our cheap Sony point and shoot to Ireland and though we printed some beautiful photographs (it's Ireland, you're going to get good photos even with a crappy camera), we decided we needed something with better quality if we were going to print our future experiences. From our research, this was the least expensive camera we could find with the largest sensor in our price range. We took the camera with us to Japan and I will say it did not disappoint with only a couple draw backs.The picture quality came out great for most pictures. The automatic setting choices were great to play with and are a great addition. If you aren't great yet at understanding how/when to manually change the shutter speed and aperture, the automatic options it gives you work great with pretty much all the options you would need. Night photos came out great (when the camera was steady enough of course). I read before hand from other reviews that the menu was really hard to find things in. I read the manual maybe twice and did not have this problem. The camera is light and does not take much space in a backpack. It has a bunch of art filters that are fun to play with, but I played with the black and white filter the most. This was hit or miss with me. Here is why; Half of the photos I took with the B&W; filter came out grainy (could have been user error, but i digress). However, the other half came out to be some of the best pictures of the trip. My suggestion would probably to just make it black and white in post production, but you could always just take multiple shots, one with and one without the filter. After all, inspiration hits when it hits.The casing is nice and sturdy and does not feel cheap, however I wish the neck strap was easier to take off for storing purposes. Also, the video looks really good and is an extra bonus to the camera. The biggest issue i had with it was when we were trying to take extreme close ups of things such as flowers. Focusing on the object right in front of the camera was harder than it should have been for some reason. During the automatic (multiple settings) or manual mode, it would focus on the objects int he background and it was frustrating. This is also possible user error in some of the circumstances, but definitely not all. When we did get it to focus, the pictures came out fantastically.If you aren't a professional photographer, but you want to start getting into photography with a smaller budget, I can't recommend this camera enough. Most of my photos from our trip look professional and I am very happy. For taking pictures and creating artwork out of them it works perfectly. I am incredibly happy and I don't foresee getting another camera in the near future. This one will do just fine for a very long time.", "Date": "April 23, 2014"}, {"Title": "Great great great", "Author": "mythirdname", "ReviewID": "R25YO4PJHXFFER", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I love M34 format, and bought this to replace my GF1.

I just wanted a decent camera for my needs and the basic point and shoots suck. I hate them.I played around with the automatic setting and I really don't care for them. I like the manual settings much better, but I guess I just like customizing to the max.It is also very small. Almost too small since a have pretty big hands. So that may be something to consider. The lens is half the camera size. I also don't like the strap it comes with. One side always slips out. I would also recommend buying a case for it.It comes with a flash that is I guess pretty decent. But I don't use it since I pretty much use my cat as a test subject or I'm outside. And I got some pretty nice pictures of him in low light settings. For example a dark, grey charcoal room with dim florescent lighting. And that little speed demon runs all over the place.I can't admit to being a professional or especially knowledgeable about the full specs of this camera. This is an opinion of someone who it is only a hobby for killing time. However, I did do a fair amount of research and this looked like the best choice for my needs since it was fairly affordable.I will say that the more expensive model with the swivel screen is something to consider since screen glare is such a pain if you're shooting in bright sunlight. So I am kinda bummed that I didn't get the other one for that reason. Which I don't think any review I saw gave practical information on why the alternative screen would be better.
