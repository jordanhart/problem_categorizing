Pentax has been a favorite of my for years.  I wanted something that could take a few bumps and use snorkeliing.  Didn't get a chance to do a lot of underwater photos, but the camera does a great job. A pro on the cruise said he has been as deep as 40ft. with no problem. I wouldn't push it that far, but there was no problem at 10ft. for sure.  Some great shots on the trip.  I would recommend this to anyone looking for a rugged, waterproof camera at a reasonable price.", "Date": "January 20, 2012"}, {"Title": "not waterproof", "Author": "spork", "ReviewID": "RQ195VNY98Z2J", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "The camera worked great for the first few days of our honeymoon until we took it into the water. Shortly after we used it the screen went blank even though the camera was on. We were unable to take any pictures afterwards, there were lines all over the screen every time we tried to take a picture. We called Pentax, who replaced it (said it was extremely water damaged), but the new camera is having the same problems as the old even though it hasn't touched the water.", "Date": "June 21, 2012"}, {"Title": "Great camera for the money!!", "Author": "Mark A.

The company allowed me to return it with no questions asked. Communication from the seller was great.

This seemed to fit the bill and it did work adequately the 4-5 times I used it.  I was in Hawaii snorkeling so much of the water is very clear.  As compared to the other camera I had, the pictures this one takes are not as clear and crisp so I'll continue to look for a better underwater camera in a reasonable price range.  And I took many of the pictures in the same location underwater in similar weather.  As I compared the two sets of pictures when I got home, I realized the other camera had taken much clearer pictures.Also The placement of the record button is directly underneath the zoom lens button so guess what I did underwater while trying to swim, navigate around coral and hold my camera.  I accidentally pushed the record button and got some great, blurry footage of my flippers, my swimsuit, the sand and all the pictures I thought I was taking I was not.  And I ran the battery down and I've learned you can't switch batteries or cards while the camera is wet without risking water getting in so that trip was a bust.For the price, I think it does OK.  Still looking for the crisp, clear, point and shoot pictures with a sturdy case for $500 and under so if anyone has any suggestions....... would appreciate it for next year's trip to Maui.", "Date": "December 20, 2013"}, {"Title": "Good camera, terrible reader", "Author": "Todd Ferrante", "ReviewID": "R19TJBOZIXGC2C", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "Thus far the camera has been very good, but beware the card reader included in this bundle.
