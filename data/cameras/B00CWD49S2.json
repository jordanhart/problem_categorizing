You can get great high-res photos (20 megapixels feels like a luxury when you see how amazing your photos come out!)  I was impressed with the length of time the battery charge lasts. I used a Canon and a Fuji previously and both had batteries that ran down much more quickly. I was so impressed with this package I ordered two more as Christmas gifts.", "Date": "August 15, 2013"}, {"Title": "Love It", "Author": "Elsa Larson", "ReviewID": "R2HNNSNPSS7TL9", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Ordered one first for our daughters graduation gift, then ordered one for ourselves.

My main concern is the long pause between taking one picture to the next.  I have small grandchildren and you have to take as many pictures as possible, as quickly as possible.  The pause must be 4 or 5 seconds which may not seem long but when you have children that are moving and not holding a pose for more than a second or two it just ruins any possible shots.", "Date": "May 20, 2014"}, {"Title": "Best camera ever", "Author": "Sonya Holbert", "ReviewID": "R3ANUVWEBG7BN1", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I love the ease of use and the high picture quality.

It came, as advertised, with extras that I would have had to purchase separately if I'd just bought the camera which I'd seen in Target and other online dealers.I started using it right out of the box and found most of the basic functions easy to learn and use. I want to say that I'm over 65 and my previous digital camera (my first) was nearly 10 years old. There are features and editing tools that I'm still learning but if you have some basic knowledge and can read, this is really simple to figure out. The picture quality is really beautiful, the 7X zoom is adequate for my needs and having the 16GB memory card is a real bonus along with a spare battery. Since the camera is really small and lightweight, this is a great item to take just about anywhere as it fits in your pocket.The only negative that I see is the camera strap is much too short, would have preferred one long enough to hang from your neck for safety of the camera. Other than that, it's a great camera at a really nice price.", "Date": "March 9, 2014"}, {"Title": "Delivered on time.vey good camera , very handy and fancy", "Author": "Franklin", "ReviewID": "R343GJPSBRIFW", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Delivered on time.vey good camera , very handy and fancy. too many other itmes like, tripod, memory card,battery etc.. great bundle offer", "Date": "March 3, 2014"}, {"Title": "happy with our purchase", "Author": "salsero", "ReviewID": "R3K5DXVUTBEPLD", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I give this rating because it exceeded my expectations we had a sony camera but it just was not as good as this one", "Date": "February 3, 2014"}, {"Title": "Great value!", "Author": "Keri Paulson", "ReviewID": "RG9OOKU9KIKHM", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I was amazed at how much came in this package!
