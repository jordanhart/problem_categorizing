{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Good Camera for my first one.", "Author": "Troy", "ReviewID": "R4TXRBC5X102D", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Reading reviews for these camera's will drive you crazy. This was my first purchase of any type of security camera.What I needed: the ability to monitor and capture video of my back porch, decent night vision a must.What I got: exactly that.Setup was easy.  If you're not technical at all I can see how some new terms might trip you up. Get the manual in PDF from foscam.us, the english isn't great but it walks you through getting it on wireless, setting up the external access (from the internet), and many of the other functions. It found my wireless network, i supplied the WPA2 pass phrase and it was connected. My camera will be about 15ft from my wireless router through two walls, frame rate viewing on my network is better than i expected. Frame over the internet isn't bad, a little jumpy but you can clearly make out what is happening.Installation: This camera requires 5V of DC power. Make sure you think about this when you place your camera. I had power in the ceiling of my porch and felt comfortable adding in a hidden box (yeah i know electricians but it's diagrammed so any subsequent homeowner will know it's there).  I have read mixed reviews about AIR802 splitter. Some say it works fine, others say the voltage drops after 10 feet and the camera won't stay on. Foscam sells a POE injector and splitter with selectable power switch to accommodate the 5V. that will set you back $50.  Standard POE is 48V!!! You should use a splitter with selectable power output!Email, DDNS, Recording settings: The setup for these was easy. For those that don't know, DDNS is how you will be able to access your camera remotely. I have my own domain and know my email settings by heart. If you want to use Gmail it has options for that built in. Yahoo, Hotmail, Outlook.com etc should work as well. Mine was emailing me within seconds of hitting Submit to save the settings.Operation: I really liked the scheduler for motion alarms.  You can adjust the sensitivity as well which is great because at setting 7 light wind blowing my trees was setting it off. Picture quality of the video isn't bad, just remember this isn't your HD Video cam or smart phone. ***Be warned it records in .AVI.***  iPhones will not play .AVI files. Night recording it easily sees to the end of my porch, which is just under 30ft.RECORDING: My biggest gripe. It only records while you have IE open and logged into the camera! So i had to write a custom script to upload videos automatically to my webspace via FTP. One way around this for the non-technical is to get a drop box account.  The videos are generally 50MB so a free dropbox account can hold around 2500 videos. Set it to save the recording (under User settings) to your dropbox synch folder. the FTP portion only uploads the same pictures it emails. Which I find kind of useless. The thing that i didn't like IE opens the page for the camera on startup (add a shortcut to the url in your startup folder) However it doesn't login automatically. So if your computer reboots for updates, you're not recording.Durability: My camera sat on my kitchen table facing a backdoor until I had time to mount it. It was knocked off twice, the second time broke the antennae off. Looking in the hole it appears a piece of metal connecting the external portion of the antennae has broken. However it still receives the wireless signal just fine and never skipped a beat. No reboot or anything. Mounted this shouldn't be an issue.Overall I'm very pleased with the camera.  MAKE SURE YOU GET THE WIDE ANGLE VERSION! 3.6MM lens!  I can't imagine having less viewable area than I have now. So the 6MM, 8MM, and 12MM lenses would only be useful to me in confined spaces. Also make sure you plan for power correctly.", "Date": "February 14, 2013"}, {"Title": "Well worth the money", "Author": "TJH", "ReviewID": "R2158HZ6R4G7XT", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "This camera is a great buy. It did ship as FI8904W with a FI8903W sticker, but since there are 2 lens options, just make sure it is marked 3.6mm on the box. The picture is very clear and night vision works excellent. I get a activex error when trying to use IE, but Firefox works great(browser of choice anyway).  Wireless seems to be strong and picks up alot of networks I don't see with any of my computers. I will be mounting it approx 120 feet from my house and have no doubt it should connect up just fine.Very easy to setup using the following steps without their software. 1. connect hardwired to your router and login to your router interface. Look under devices to get the ip address. 2. open browser and enter IP address in the url addres (192.168.x.x) this will take you to the login page. Login:admin, pw: leave blank. **IMPORTANT** click the correct login button(1 for IE, and one for all other browsers). 3. under \"user settings\" change pw for admin account 3. under \"wireless settings\",scan and connect to your wireless - Now is a good time to set a static IP under \"network settings\" 4. unplug network cable and reboot the camera. repeat step 2 to verify wireless working. Motion detection alarm works great with email notification.

Apparently some part of the power supply quit. I previously gave it a fair review, in spite of the quirks I listed below...My disappointments are:It was frustrating getting the wireless configuration to work. Apparently the device doesn't support WEP.The \"wide angle\" lens is a fish-eye type. The image size is 640x480.You have to use IE and keep it running if you want any recording to happen.Motion detection seems to be highly-biased toward the center of the image.Motion compensation seems to do nothing. I get false alarms when the sun goes behind the clouds; yet someone can walk right in the center of the picture and not trigger an alarm.Recording does not start fast enough. If someone walks quickly enough across the field of view, the recording will miss them.You can't control the length of alarm-generated recordings.

The price was decent and although I was put off by all the negative reviews for this product, I took the plunge.I found the software easy to set up and got the camera working in wireless mode very quickly.  However, after that, everything went down hill.  The physical camera has a large wire coming out of the back when a small, thin wire is all that is needed.  This is a terrible design flaw, because in addition to the power line, there is a cable for reset and another cable for the LAN interconnect, both of which are only needed one time, at setup.  You have to either drill a very big hole in your wall to get this cable through, or you can leave the two unnecessary cables exposed to the weather and run the thin power cable through your wall or window, as I did.The mounting bracket is cheesy and broke right away when I tried to mount the camera to it.  Fortunately, I had another laying around and used that.After finally getting the camera installed on the side of the building, I aimed it and then went inside to make some final adjustments to the contrast and brightness.  When I changed the settings for those items, the camera went blank and stopped communicating altogether.  I took the whole thing down, ran through the setup again and it worked fine.  But after reinstalling the camera on the mounting bracket it does not communicate or show the picture at all.I have already spent too much time messing with this thing.  In retrospect, I should have paid more attention to the negative reviews that this product has garnered.  I'm sending it back for a refund and get something with better reviews.

The box indicates it came with an optional 3.6mm \"wide angle\" lens but it's still narrower than I really need.I got used to the pan / tilt function of the other cameras and need to rethink where this one is mounted.Otherwise I'm very used to the software interface by now. It works well with camera applications on my iOS (Netcam4, Netcam8, LiveCams Pro) and Android (tinyCam Monitor Pro) devices. It also does server push to Chrome and Safari.The worst operation is with the ActiveX control used in Internet Explorer so I just avoid that.I also wish there was a time date overlay like I have on my Panasonic IP cameras.In the end this does what I need for a very reasonable price.", "Date": "July 11, 2012"}, {"Title": "Very good value for the money", "Author": "Mark Filip", "ReviewID": "R1258P9OTEXKBC", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Camera is small/compact but does a really good job for the price point.  It is a standard VGA (640x480) but, like others have reported, the color is actually much better now.Kaspersky reports that the software that comes with the camera has a virus but I'm not sure if that's because the software 'scans' for other cameras or if it's really infected.I have several high end cameras and this one, although lower end, does quite well with daytime and nighttime critter watching.  The only minor drawback is that, although designed for outdoor use, the extra cables need to be wrapped up in plastic, to protect them from the elements, seems like there should be a better design for that somehow.The mounting bracket/brace that comes with this unit is fairly useless and extremely cheaply made, so you'd be better off buying a small camera tripod.

Wait a couple minutes, rinse & repeat... This happens very consistently on both WiFi and Ethernet (even with wifi completely disabled).  Using a static IP address that was confirmed unused before assigning it, so I know it's not an IP conflict or network error.FYI, the latest firmware available for this on the Foscam website is 2 minor revisions *behind* what shipped with the camera.

The older one laster over 5 years before it began to leak during rain storms.Amaxingly it still works but the lense gets fogged by the moister in the cam.  After installing the 18903 I was impressed by the picture.  It was true color and not faded out like all the old ones.  I went ahead and purchased another thinking that one at a time I would replace all the older camera's with the new true color ones.  Before the second one arrived I started having issues with my new 18903. It worked fine for a few days then it started to come up with all the images in a blue color and as the day went on the cam would disapeared from site on the interenet and on my home network.  The only way to get it back was to power off and on the camera.I of course thought it was defective so I waited for the next cam to come in and installed it where the first one was, returning the original camera for a refund.  With in days the new one was doing the same thing as the first one.  Within a week it would not turn on al all.Once again, giving Foscam the benifit of the doubt I retuned the cam and got another one......same thing.  Up for a while then had to be reset by powering down and back up.I now have returned the last of the 18903's and have gone to Agasio 603's. I know that this company is really Foscam but the camera is very differant.  So far the first cam has been installed for a week with constant service. I was going to say no issues but this camera does have one issue.  In bright light it ever so slightly shifts from one brightness to another.  It is notisable but it is something that I can live with. It has the true colors as did the 18903 when it was working, which is the reason I got into changing the older working cams.

Have not tired the FTP, but I assume it works fine.3) Affordable4) Easy web UI with some options to adjust image quality wherever you are.Con's:1) Not exactly \"wide angle.\" Although it does have a decent viewing angle. Just don't expect anything super wide.2) Resolution is lacking. Max is 640 x 480. Image is slightly fuzzy/grainy. Suits my needs well enough though.3) Dongle is a little awkward with power and Ethernet all attached in one spot. No option to just have a power cord for clean installation.4) IR at night tends to wash out things directly in front of it. Haven't tried the \"IR cut\" feature yet. Not exactly sure where it is on the UI. I have it set to \"outdoor\" mode.UPDATE #1:I've used this in two locations in 1 month. The first was at home where temps are about 35 degrees. It dropped to the mid-twenties at night for about a week strait as well. I had sun and rain and everything worked fine. I recently transferred it to a cabin in the mountains where it's in the 20's and 30's and few feet of snow on the ground. This is where it has showed its flaws. The IR gives a false alarm when it switched over in the morning (AND SOMETIMES NIGHT). The camera also flickers quite a bit when the sun comes out and reflects off the snow, causing more false alarms. After going to the Foscam forums, this seems to be a common complaint. The camera has no way of knowing the IR cut is giving a false alarm. As for the flickering, the only option is to downsize the viewing resolution. The highest level resolution of 640 x 480 is nothing to write home about. Having to use the smaller 320 x 240 makes me feel like I'm using '90's tech. The flickering can best be described as a dynamic contract getting confused, but as far as I can tell, there is no dynamic contrast feature built in.So now I'm using the 320 x 240 resolution and the alarm sensitivity set at 1 (out of 10; 10 being the highest). I still get false alarms at this setting.All of the firmware is at the latest revisions, which was supposed to stop the flickering. But it obviously hasn't. Again, the issue only happens when there is sun and snow present (i.e.- a lot of light variance quickly). I'll add one star if they can fix it via firmware update.UPDATE #2:I've been using this for a few months now and have had a recurring issue where the alarm and the night-vision (IR) conflict. When then IR comes on OR off in the AM/PM the alarm triggers and sends me an email. Very annoying. I ended up turning off the alarm during the hours that the IR would tun on/off, which sort of defeats the purpose of a motion alarm for security purposes. I emailed customer support about this and they recommend I hard reset the device, which is a no-go for me since it's managed remotely. All firmware is up to date but I have seen that this is a common problem. From my experience, any time customer support tells you to \"hard reset\" their product, it's usually a sign that there is no fix. -1 star.The alarm also triggers when the sun comes and goes, even at low sensitivity. Seems the dynamic contract isn't smart enough to compensate. The work-around is to lower the resolution to the smallest setting, which is not ideal since the resolution is already pretty low.So mainly, my gripes are due to the alarm functionality. Turn it off and it's an OK product. I will look elsewhere for my next IP Webcam with alarm functionality for my next purchase.", "Date": "January 14, 2013"}, {"Title": "Good Camera", "Author": "Mr TV", "ReviewID": "R22U3O6LRGRLK2", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This is a really good stationary camera.
