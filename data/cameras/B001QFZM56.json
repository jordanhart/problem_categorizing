However, it was very difficult to change between modes, there were long delays while the camera processed the pictures and the battery ran out quickly.  My battery did not last the whole day on a recent vacation.  I had to take fewer pictures and recharge at night.  I finally got an extra battery online.", "Date": "May 30, 2009"}, {"Title": "Awesome bonuses with a few drawbacks...", "Author": "Alison M. Haines \"Mrs Haines\"", "ReviewID": "R27HBVP5ZMCYDR", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "This camera is great if you really like to take videos as well as pictures. The picture quality is good, not great, and the double flash and preview delay is a little annoying. The zoom for pictures is unlike any point and shoot I've ever worked with and still gets you great quality. The battery dies after about an hour and a half of shooting video, but that is pretty typical. The HD video is a great advantage, and taking videos isn't a daunting task thanks to the triple motion shock thing. Other digital cameras almost seemed pointless because the shaking was naturally so bad, but this is the first one where you can enjoy filming. Highly recommend getting at least a 4 GB memory card.", "Date": "March 11, 2009"}, {"Title": "Awesome travel sized camera", "Author": "Cynthia Guajardo", "ReviewID": "R2MMHN5Q3SDH68", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "My husband I decided to take a trip to Europe this summer and started searching for a ultra compact pocket sized camera.  A friend of mine owns the Pentax Optio W30 - basically the same camera only capable of underwater shots.  After testing the Optio W30, we decided to buy the Pentax Optio P70 camera because we are impressed with size, features, large LCD screen, MP and ease of use.  Even my 11 year old daughter didn't need to read the manual and started using it out of the box including shooting videos.  Highly recommend for taking everyday photos.", "Date": "July 10, 2009"}, {"Title": "Well worth the money", "Author": "Melanie Langstaff", "ReviewID": "R1D47346NTS8ET", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I love this camera.
