I really needed a battery cell that would give me an accurate reminaing battery read. I found this battery to be just what I needed.Why is this a good deal?1.) It works and holds a decent charge2.) It is significantly cheaper than the stock Panny battery for the G63.) This is the big one for me: my G6 gives an accurate remaining battery reading with this battery, so I don't have to worry about my camera just shutting off without warning. From what I've read, other brands of the same battery model do not have this capability.I've only had this battery for about a month, but it has lasted and been consistent thus far. Purchasing this battery should be a no-brainer for owners of a G6.", "Date": "November 16, 2013"}, {"Title": "Battery Replacement", "Author": "Alvin L.

There is nothing not to like. Instead of paying over $40 for a Chinese battery with Panasonic stamped on it, $14 for this battery (with a better warranty) makes perfect sense.

The battery is identical to the original in shape, and connects just fine, including showing (via the camera screen) how much charge remains. I think the 1600 mAH is a bit more than the original battery, but I don't know if that was of benefit.  All I know is, the battery functioned VERY well in my camera over an 8-day tour workout, at least as well as the camera's original Panasonic version.

Would you? Same here!", "Author": "Derek Simmons", "ReviewID": "R1QOACMYWE0LRG", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "I bought this battery for the price. I guess I got what I paid for. What I didn't get--and what some previous reviewers suggested I would get--is a battery that tells you how much \"juice\" you have left. (Think \"mini\" spare analogy: you know up front NOT to drive on it except to the closest service station.) Use this Halcyon battery the same way. Keep it as a spare, charged up and ready to go when your \"real\" LUMIX battery goes \"flat\" when you're out on the road. Then use the Halcyon but then REMEMBER: charge the \"real\" LUMIX and swap it back into the camera at the earliest opportunity just as you would with your cars \"mini\" spare tire.DO NOT TRUST THE ICON in your viewfinder when the camera is on \"Halcyon\" power. It lies! It doesn't lie when the LUMIX battery is doing the work. I'd buy it again as a \"spare\", but I would never plan on \"hitting the road\" on Halcyon power. You WILL miss the shot of a lifetime.

Maybe it's just me, but it doesn't seem to  hold a \"non use\" charge for my requirements, which is holding a \"full\" charge for two - three weeks after charging.  While I alternate batteries in my camera, if I don't use it immediately after charging, I don't get as many shots as my Panasonic battery.  I still haven't determined if the level readings are accurate yet, and given that some batteries have been reported to wipe your memory card when they are  \"empty\" and in need of recharging, I'm going to watch this carefully.  I just wish there was some sort of case for the battery as the terminals are exposed and should be protected, particularly as I often carry spare batteries in my pocket.If all checks out to be good, I will be buying a couple more of these.", "Date": "March 2, 2014"}, {"Title": "Good, inexpensive replacement battery", "Author": "Malcolm Schoen", "ReviewID": "R1UMRZ1ZH9GNHG", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I had been worried because in past had had problems with non-Nikon replacement batteries for my previous camera.
