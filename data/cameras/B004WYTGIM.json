After several hours of trying to understand how it works the best I could do with it was several blurred images. The viewfinder also was blurred and almost useless. It is so small it is very difficult to hold and even harder to shoot.

There was little information but many sellers. I see why now. The camera is the size of a quarter and need a separate battery pack to plug into it. It is hard to hold and you never know if you actually took a photo just to find out that the disk to read the photos is not compatible with Windows 7 (not sure on any other OS). It even crashed my computer and I have to re-install everything.", "Date": "February 28, 2013"}, {"Title": "Just what I wanted and expected.", "Author": "Walters Family FL", "ReviewID": "R2CX8Q73RL67VZ", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I hope to get more.
