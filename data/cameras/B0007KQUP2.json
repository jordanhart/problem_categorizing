My first Canon digicam was Canon a60 which was great but it was a bit too bulky for me. I bought this camera as a alternative option next to my canon a400 and I'm definitely satisfied.Pros:-4x Zoom ( Can't beat that!...many digicams only come with 3x)-Big and bright 1.8 screen which gains light in the dark-It's canon! Great lens and brand. Very reliable-A bit faster shutter speed compared with Canon A400-Very Comfortable to hold and very firm (has hand grip)-Movie mode at 640x480 for 30sec and 320x240 for 3 mins max-Use only 2 AA batteries. Last over 100 pics with flash and screen on at all time(I tested it with 2300mAh rechargable batteries)-Fast start-up time(less than 3 second once you turn the camera on)-Easy to use for anyone who familiar with canon digicam(same board which is Digic!...too bad this cam does not come with Digic2 which works faster and allows user to record longer movie clip)-Great printing quality as usual for CanonCons:-Still has slow shutter speed when taking picture at best quality with flash(up to 5 secs which isn't so bad compared to Canon A400)-A bit bigger than other brand for the same price and pixels(but you get canon camera that uses AA battery + 4x zoom)-The dial swich and capture/view switches are a bit hard to turn at first but it got easier after a month)Overall, I love this camera as Canon seems to know what they are doing when they make their cameras. I'm one happy canon's customer. Buy it and you won't regret it.Also, you can buy canon case psc60 which designed for A60-A95 models, it sure fits this canon a510 just fine. Or else, try the psc65 which designed just for Canon A510 and A520.Hope this review will help someone who is deciding which camera to buy.

Very good image quality.2. 3 MP and 4x optical zoom is the perfect combo for most people.3. Priced right, unlike some overpriced digicams out there.4. Works on 2 normal AA batteries (buy rechargeable ones for extra life and lower cost), unlike expensive & hard-to-find propreitary batteries.5. The menu on the Canon cameras is light years ahead of most other manufacturer's. Lots of manual options and scene modes.6. Battery and SD card doors seem to be of above average quality.7. 1.8\" LCD screen is bright and fluid.8. Uses standard SD cards, unlike propretary memory cards like Memory Stick or xD card.9.

It uses Digic instead of Digic2 processor in other new Canons.3. Tripod mount is on the corner and made from plastic.I guess you gotta spend more money to buy Elph series for more pocketability. I am almost sure this will be THE best selling camera of 2005, just like A60 and A75 in past. With a price this low for a fully loaded A510 there really is no reason to buy slightly cheaper but vastly inferior cameras from HP, Kodak, Olympus, Fuji or Samsung.", "Date": "February 16, 2005"}, {"Title": "An excellent Camera at an Amazing Price!", "Author": "diljs", "ReviewID": "R1I6B7BQL1OIQT", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This camera is an incredible value for the price.Let me begin by saying that Canon makes exceptional digital cameras; the best in the market right now.  This is because they have always used high quality components since they began manufacturing digital cameras.  This one is no exception.The Axxx series is the successor to the excellent Axx series, with a few very useful upgrades, such as the switch from 4AA to 2AA batteries (with no decrease in camera life!), and the 4x optical zoom.A510 vs A520 vs SDxxxFirst off, the A510 and A520 are identical except for the 3.2 megapixel sensor in the A510 and 4mp on the A520.  Today, megapixel ratings are similar to Ghz ratings in the computer world: They used to mean a lot, but with today's cameras, it doesn't mean that much anymore.  More megapixels do NOT mean a better image.  They mean a larger printable image.  In this case, the A510 has a maximum resolution of 2048x1536 pixels, or an 8.5x11 picture.  The A520 has a max resolution of 2272x1704 pixels, or a picture slightly larger than 8.5x11.Unless you need a slightly bigger picture, the A510 is a better buy.When it comes to the Axxx or an SDxxx, it depends on what you need.  The Axxx series will give you a better picture quality, manual controls, and standard AA batteries which actually last twice as long as the SDxxx series' proprietary batteries.  The SDxxx series will give you better movies, the new Dig!c 2 processor, and a compact, cool looking camera, at a higher cost and with a very fragile exposed LCD screen.Features:Pros:-Beautiful image quality, better than any other camera at this price range (no purple fringing like on the SDxxx)-4x optical zoom!  It's very hard to find another camera in this class.  This alone makes the camera superior to most of the competition-Excellent, intuitive manual controls-Easy to hold naturally - no fingers in the way of the lens-Beautiful 1.8 inch lcd that looks great under various lighting conditions-The lcd is protected by a plastic layer, unlike the exposed and easily broken SDxxx lcds.-Uses AA batteries, which are cheap and easy to find instead of expensive proprietary batteries-Uses widely available and cheap SD or MMC cards (SD are faster)Cons (most of these are minor quirks):-Movie mode isn't as good as the SDxxx series-Only USB 1.1 transfer speed (SDxxx have usb 2.0)-Uses the still good, but outdated Dig!c processor, instead of the Dig!c 2 in the SDxxx series and some newer Canons-A historical problem for Canons still shows in this camera in the flimsy battery/Memory card coversIf you do choose this product, the first thing you should buy is a larger SD memory card.  The camera comes with a 16mb MMC card, which is pretty much useless.  MMC cards are slower than SD, and 16mb will fill up very quickly.You should also consider a case, such as the very affordable and custom fit PC-65.Also, as with any camera, rechargeable NIMH batteries are a must.  You don't need to pay for the expensive Canon set however, similar offerings from Energizer, Rayovac, etc. will work fine.", "Date": "April 18, 2005"}, {"Title": "excelent package at low price", "Author": "math-tutorchicago-org", "ReviewID": "R2RQEJWGBNYFZP", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "If you were wondering which one to buy - Canon A510 (the compact) or Canon SD200 (the ultra-compact), here is the bottom line - A510 takes a bit sharper pics, has manual controls and longer battery life than SD200. On the other hand, SD200 is tinier and its movie mode is superior. Details below:++ A510 is about $50-$100 cheaper than SD200 (get lowest prices with [...]++ A510 has manual controls for focus, aperture and time of exposure (shutter speed); SD200 doesn't have any of these.++ A510 takes a bit sharper pics than SD200. A510 doesn't have blurry pic conrners or pirple fringing, SD200 has both. The white balance on both cams is equivalent. The above differences would matter ony to experts - for most consumers both cameras produce really excellent pics - low noise, proper exposure and white balance even in dim light without flash or at night.++ A510 uses two AA bateries (rechargeable or not); SD200 uses rechargeable lithium-ion battery (NB-4L);  According to Canon, the battery life of two rechargeable AA's in A510 is:......300 shots (LCD on, CIPA test standard)......800 shots (LCD off),......300 minutes playback time.  The battery life of NB-4L in SD200 is:......140 shots(LCD on, CIPA test standard),......400 shots (LCD off),......180 minutes playback time.From the above data A510 has two times longer battery life.-- A510 is compact (like a wallet full of cash lol) and you can carry it in your jacket or purse but not in your pants pocket. SD200 is ultra-compact (like a pack of cigaretts or a deck of cards) and you can really carry it in your jeans pocket but that is not advisable cause you may damage it - many people complained of easily cracked LCD screen.-- A510 has 1.8 inches LCD,  SD200 has 2.0 inches LCD.-- A510 uses the older processor DIGIC I;  SD200 uses the newer and faster DIGIC II, hence the differences below ...-- A510 is a bit slower in responding and autofocusing than SD200 but the difference is less than 1/3 sec and doesn't matter much.-- A510 records movies with limited length (30 sec at 640x480 resolution, 3 minutes at lower resolutions); SD200 records till the memory card is full.-- A510 records movies with 10 frames/sec (at 640x480 pixels) and 15 frames/sec (at 320x240 pixels). SD200 lets you choose 30 frames/sec or 15 frames/sec (at both 640x480 and 320x240 pixels). If you are recording at 320x240 and 15 frames/sec, then the size of the file is about 230 KB/sec for both cameras.-- A510 can produce a properly exposed movie ONLY if lighting conditions remain relatively CONSTANT during recording - the exposure is locked to the first movie frame and if you move around to a little darker corner or a little brighter lit room, the A510 movie will get unacceptably dark or bright correspondingly. SD200 doesn't have that problem since it adjusts the exposure continuously to match the changing light conditions during recording.--- A510 uses USB1.1 to download pics/movies to a computer (download speed is 450 KB/sec on my computer), SD200 uses USB2.0 that is two times faster (900 KB/sec on my computer).", "Date": "March 6, 2005"}, {"Title": "Great Digital Camera (for under $200)", "Author": "Ex-Nerd", "ReviewID": "R3SH0UU10OQBVE", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "This is my 3rd digital camera, purchased after my previous camera was lost. I got the A510 because all of the more expensive models didn't really satisfy my needs and wants - so if I was going to replace the camera in a year or two (when the new Canons, Nikons, or others catch up to my expectations of them), then why spend too many $$$ now?  I wanted compactness & portability, point-and-shoot plus manual control capability, a longer optical zoom (more than 3X), a wide-angle that was really wide angle (at least 35mm using the old \"35mm camera equivalent\" scale).  Also, I'm doing glorified snapshots of the family, so really high resolution and pixels were not so important to me; 3.2 Megapixels is enough.  This Canon A510 met all of the above criteria, at a bargain price, and had the full manual operation capability (which is a bit rare to find) in case I ever wanted to get really serious about one or the other photo situation.  It's big brother the A520 was overpriced for the amount of improvements it gave me.  After purchase, I find that the A510 is basically \"as expected; sometimes even better\".  I have not noticed any significant lag after shooting as others have reported, but then I am not doing action sports photos, and do have some good NiMH batteries.  Things I would like to improve: (1) the zoom can be jerky at times (not so great for fast changes and action photos), (2) when the battery indicator starts to say \"low\" you are very nearly \"inoperative\", (3) in video mode the zoom and exposure are locked at the beginning and will not adjust during \"filming\" (a very common failing of still cameras doing video).  Also, you do need to be careful with the little doors that cover the memory card and the batteries, since they are a bit fragile.  They're plastic on metal hinges; abuse them, and they can break a bit too easily. (I have seen this, but not experienced it myself.)

Mai \"Goodpics\"", "ReviewID": "R19HQCJL9UH3OQ", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "In the entry level class of digital camera, Canon A serie is the best for design, quality, feature and price.Design - Canon redesigned the A serie to be smaller, lighter, thanks to the use of SD memory card and only 2 AA batteries instead of 4 previouly.  The battery compartment allows the camera to be a little bit thicker on the right side and it allows you to have a firm grip on the camera with one hand.  The shooting mode dial on the top of the camera allows you to switch modes quickly, no need to navigate thru menus to switch modes.Quality - Even thought the camera body is plastic, I find the fit and finish excellent.  And of course Canon legendary lens quality.  Start up time seems faster than the previous A serie generation.Features - Starting with a 4X optical zoom, most other brands give you only 3X optical zoom.  The A510/520 gives you a full range of shooting modes (Full Manual, Semi Manual - Shutter & Aperture, Automatic, Presets), no other brands give you the manual mode.  Macro mode can snap pictures as close as 2 inches.  A wide range of accessories, particularly the external flash which allows to extend the flashlight to 30ft.Price - The A510 is cheap for what it is capable of doing.  I got mine for $160 at OfficeMax.  Is it worth spending more to get the 4 megapixels A520?  Not unless you want to print picture size bigger than 8x10.So far my A510 takes very sharp pictures and I don't have any problems with this camera.

Though I am not taking pictures for a living now, I used to at one point of my life, and still know, humbly, better than many people that I encountered in the profession.  I am now a web developer and often have to take pictures for the albums of the sites I manage; one is for a local newspaper, and the other is for a church governing body.  I wanted a camera that I can carry with me all the time and I want it to be able to take good pictures in the meeting rooms without flash.  A510 meets both of my needs.Some meeting rooms are not well lit.  I like to take lots of pictures, then choose the best ones out of them.  (Most high end magazines choose one picture out of a thousand.  That's my style.)  So if I use flash, the room will be flashing like a news conference.  They don't like it.  If I don't use, I need a $1000 camera to get good pictures.  But A510 gives me good indoor picture without flash.This should provide enough of my impression of this camera.

The canon a510 is a nice compromise for me in that it provides a number of options I'm only beginning to get into, in addition to the automatic mode in which most everything comes out surprisingly well.The only time I've seen automatic mode not work well is when I've taken pictures of tall trees in the shade. It starts off light and then gets too dark as I reach the top of the tree with the lens. Once I learn to adjust settings manually that may change.  I've actually taken pictures 20 feet away, down a hall, in total darkness, and with the flash you can't even tell the lights are off.I'm turned off by the long wait I get between taking pictures, but have learned to minimize this by turning off the preview settings after each shot. Much of the wait is from the flash having to recharge, and even that can be turned off.I routinely walk around and take over 100 pictures in about an hour, filling a 256 meg card much more easily than I expected. The battery life is good for at least a few hundred pics, though I usually rotate before then.So overall it's a good camera for the price, with the only other small camera brand I'd consider right now being the Casio Exilim EX-S100 or a similar model. Remember that megapixels are largely insignificant, with higher numbers often meaning more noise.

Technically, Canon is calling them the replacement for the A95. However, since no direct replacement were announced for the A510/A520 (and simply by looking at the New Model Numbers), it's safe to assume that the NEW Canon A610/A620 were meant to replace the A510/A520 as well.  Btw, you can see the specs for those on my favorite photo site-[...]To summarize, the Biggest Improvement will be the incorporation of the DIGIC II Processor to reduce the shutter lag between shots. I have personally owned the Canon A520 and whilst I love its size, image quality, and use of 2 \"AA\" batteries, it was WAY TOO SLOW! So Slow, that I found it unuseable.  The new models will be heavier since they will use 4 \"AA\" Batteries for additional POWER. But I think you will agree with me that the addition of Two \"AA\" batteries is a small price to pay for Faster Speed and More Features! Finally, the A610 will cost $299 and the Whopping 7 MP (!)  A620 will cost $399. SO, if you are in the market for the Canon A95, you just might want to wait 'til after October 10, 2005 before you make your decision.

Once you buy that adaptor you have a 52mm thread that now lets me use any 52mm accessory (filters, lenses, etc.)And I found out that having this adaptor on the front of the camera gives you a second handhold (with or without a lens on it) so I can now hold the camera somewhat like a SLR and get steadier shots. And even if you're not using a lens you can just put a UV filter on the front and now your lens is always encased and protected. This is an accessory I recommend getting.That link up there has even more pictures now and the most recent ones are shot using the new lenses.

Kodaks also have that handy docking station, but just by dangling a USB cord to the side of the computer, this is ready to load in a snap.

For the price(I got it from Dell for about $150), I think it is a great digicam. Auto mode works great for Daylight shots and I have not noticed any sort of blur even at full zoom. However for low light shots, Auto mode seems to give underexposed photos, particularly if the subject is not well lit. I also experienced some focussing problems(nothing major)at full zoom. I think the best way to use it for low light shots is to use it in the manual model. By properly adjusting ISO and shutter speed I was able to take nice shots even in really dark situations without any blur or focussing problems. I found that an ISO of 200 and shutter speed of about 1/10 to 1/20 seconds works to get well exposed photos without blur in most low light situations(without tripod). The noise is really well controlled at 200 ISO. Also, center focus seems to work better and faster than the nine frame focus at night. The flash recycle is slow, perhaps due to the fact that it uses only 2 AA. I do not care about it a lot as I very rarely use the flash.

While I enjoy some of them, most of the time my pictures turn out grainy (in low light), whitewashed (with flash) or blurry (of even slowly moving objects).  I have tried changing the exposure time and shutter speed to counter some of these things, but I rarely get a good picture when I need it.  I never had these problems with my ELPH s200.  This camera is also a lot more bulkier as well, and the cover over the lens has started to stick so that it does not fully open when turned on. If given the option I would not buy this camera again.", "Date": "June 3, 2006"}, {"Title": "Great camera, but lens has a bit of distortion", "Author": "Your Average Gadgeteer", "ReviewID": "R2ZFGEVNTL26A", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Overall, this is a great point-and-shoot digital camera.  I'm not a photographer or an enthusiast, but the pictures I've taken with this camera look very good.  The camera also comes with a sizable number of user-adjustable settings for those who want more control over their photos.  Another big plus is the A510's use of SD cards and AA batteries, which make this a flexible and cheap camera to operate.On the downside, shutter speed is a bit slow in high-quality mode, which can be annoying when you're trying to capture an exact moment (blowing out candles, etc.).  The only other downside I've noticed is that the lens tends to distort vertical lines, particularly toward the sides of the frame, more than other cameras I've used before.

Hopefully I have better luck than the with the first one.", "Date": "June 27, 2005"}, {"Title": "Later models improve, but this isn't bad at all", "Author": "Mal-2", "ReviewID": "R31FRNDVB64TIR", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Let me start with the bad, and get the complaining out of the way.First, the CCD is a little bit on the noisy side, especially in low light situations. That said, I'm still surprised at the number of low-light, no-flash pictures that can be salvaged in Photoshop.Second, it has an artificial limit on video length - 30 seconds at 640x480 and 3 minutes at lower resolutions. I cannot see any good reason for this, as the A530 and A540 can record video until you run out of power or memory. Also, those later models will let you do \"digital zoom\" while shooting and this camera will not. The zoom ratio you start with is what you are stuck with for the entire video.Third, the flash recycle time is longer than I would like. This is probably due to the choice of two AA batteries as a power source, and it does not seem to be any better on my mother's A530.Fourth, the display is small. It's a small camera, deal with it. You can zoom in on a picture if you feel it's necessary to check it on the spot.Finally, it has significant barrel distortion at the wide end of the zoom range. Most of the time you aren't going to notice, but it is visible and somewhat bothersome in architectural photos.These flaws rule out a five-star rating, but the camera still has plenty going for it.First, the optics are sharp, although I noted the distortion issue above. I do not get the purple fringing I have seen on some other cameras. I believe these optics went unchanged into the A530 and A540, which means they are probably overkill for a 3.2MP sensor. The f/2.6 maximum aperture is quite usable.Second, the flash is surprisingly good. The red-eye reduction doesn't work particularly well, but it never does with a flash this close to the lens axis (and you can fix that in the bundled software). I noted the cycle time issue, but I can't complain about the amount of light generated once it does charge.Third, it's not as hungry as some other cameras I've tried. I would tell you how long one set of NiMH AA batteries last, but I can't -- I've never been able to run them flat. I just pop in freshly charged batteries before every adventure and I'm good to go. The fact that it uses AA batteries also means you're never more than a trip to 7-11 away from a fresh charge, if the situation calls for it.Fourth, it's very versatile. The \"Auto\" mode is dead simple to operate, enabling macro focusing is a single button press, the zoom is very intuitive, the pre-focusing behaves exactly like you would expect from a larger camera, and it does shoot video with sound. At the same time, it has manual mode, Av and Tv modes, a rear-curtain flash sync mode, and many other ways to bend it far beyond mere snapshots. Simple when you need it, complex when you want it -- perfect balance. The mode wheel is a good, old-fashioned click wheel, so once you memorize where your favorite click stops are, you don't even have to look. As you would expect from a Canon camera, it also has 2-second and 10-second self-timer modes, so you can line up a family photo and have time to sneak yourself into it. The camera sits quite stably, so you can usually improvise a platform to use if you don't carry a folding tripod.Fifth, the included Windows software is pretty good. You don't absolutely have to use it, but if you don't want to, you pretty much have to use a card reader to transfer. Thus it's fairly important that the software is both easy to use and flexible enough to do most of the things you want.Sixth, it uses a standard \"mini USB\" cable to connect to the computer. This means that if you ever lose it, or wish to have a spare, you do not have to get a special part. Also, since so many other devices use the same style cable, you can (as I do) leave the cable permanently attached to the computer and attach devices to it as necessary. I have a webcam and MP3 player that use the same type of cable, so there's usually something attached.Finally, it has a removable ring around the lens to attach an adapter, allowing you to attach all manner of filters, wide and tele lens extenders, or whatever you would want to attach. The Canon adapter is also threaded to 52 mm, which is a very common filter size. If you have an old SLR, chances are you already own some 52 mm filters.If you are wondering if 3.2MP is enough and you wouldn't be better off with more megapixels, all I can say is this: If you don't know exactly why you need more than this resolution... you probably don't. I have been able to run 12\" by 18\" color laser prints from my pictures with quite acceptable quality -- do YOU have access to a printer bigger than that? I would not mind an upgrade to the A530, but only because of its significantly better video capabilities. More pixels in the same size sensor usually means more noise and longer save times between pictures, though admittedly you do not have to run at maximum resolution at all times. It generally is easiest though to shoot at the highest resolution and worry about reducing it after you get home.If you feel you need the enhanced capabilites of the A530 or A540 (for an additional $50-120, last I checked), then by all means buy one. You won't be disappointed. But if you want an inexpensive, pocketable camera that doesn't take cheap-looking pictures, you can't go wrong with the A510. All the accessories are the same, so if you decide to upgrade later, it is only the camera you have to buy.", "Date": "June 27, 2007"}, {"Title": "It's half the size of the one that rolled off my trunk lid", "Author": "Ronald Hinton", "ReviewID": "R1Q4L9DBR278J6", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "This camera has a lot of great bells and whistles, even live video cam.

Recently, I decided to dive in completely.  The challenge was to satisfy both high and low end requirements and to enable printing WITHOUT having to connect to a computer.Here's what I bought for my wife and kids:-A510-Epson PictureMate DeluxeHere's what I bought for me:-350D (Rebel XT) with all the gismos (battery grip, filter, extra batteries, chargers, etc).We purchased the A510 for low end usage.  And while the A510 has nearly as many options as the 350D, it can be 'automated' for everyday use.  Because it comes with only a 16MB card, you will need to visit every menu option to select the appropriate defaults for your usage (most of ours is just for 4x6 prints).  Once you've done that, I suggest simply keeping it on the AUTO or P modes for everything.  The 2 main differences between AUTO and P is that AUTO selects the ISO (with P, you set it) and always uses a flash if needed (with P, you can turn off the flash).  In any case, the A510 is compact (fits in a purse), light (only uses 2 AA batteries) and does not burn through batteries like I've seen some other digitals do (but you will still need a battery charger - I suggest using NiMH instead of NiCd).  The autofocus is smart and the images are noise free (even at ISO 400).  Bottom Line: if this is your low end, every day family camera, it's perfect; there is no need to wait for the 'next' version.  In fact, I would recommend jumping on this model as you will probably find good prices while they phase it out.As for the Epson printer and the 350D, they are working out as well (but not the subject of this review).Here is the BUYER BEWARE part (and the part Amazon will probably remove from this review).  I still have not received the camera from Amazon.  Because it was taking them so long to ship it (as of this writing it has been 13 days and delivery is not expected for 4 more), I ordered it elsewhere (and even saved another $25).", "Date": "September 3, 2005"}, {"Title": "Excellent camera", "Author": "DS_Lightning21", "ReviewID": "R1HLZFHGSJBG83", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Excellent camera, especially for a college student like me.

It makes no sense why a camera would stop being a great camera just because a few years went by.  There is so much to love about this camera.  For starters, it will do all the things that you want a point and shoot to do.  It will zoom in and out and take pictures with or without a flash.  Then, if you put two lithium batteries in this camera it will be thousands of pictures and a year later when you have another power issue.  My wife and I went on a second honeymoon for a few weeks and I took a thousand shots while on vacation.  When we got home I used the camera a couple a times a month for a year until I had to replace them.  I mainly used the optical viewfinder for my shooting to save battery life on the trip not understanding that it probably wasn't necessary.I have even purchased the optional device (LA-DC52F) that allows you to attach filters and other converters to your camera.  It comes with full manual control, and even manual focusing if you wish.  The images are punchy and sharp and it has operated reliably for all the years I have had it.

I chose the A510 as my first digital camera, five years ago after many hours of research and review reading. It has, up until very recently, been my main instrument, has never failed me in any way and for a point and shoot - low or higher end - it takes absolutely fantastic pictures in all conditions and has manual overrides for most features, which was an essential for me. I opted for the A series as opposed to the SD series, as image quality was reported to be (and is) better with the As. In addition, I shoot quite a bit in low light, so the fact that it is a little heavier than the SDs is good as it keeps steady. I have perfectly clear images of the night sky using the manual time exposure feature, handheld! The weight is mostly dues to the fact that the A510 uses AA batteries, which although I have to carry extras, it works out better for a traveler like me since I can always get AAs and can't always get an outlet to plug into. It is, however, quite compact and lightweight, enough that I literally always have it with me and never think of it as extra weight in my bag. As reported in many reviews, the A510 has better image quality than the A520, and has superior image quality for most cameras in its class. Prints look great up to 8x10. My only two complaints are the following. 1) The flash leaves a lot to be desired. I typically bounce the flash (when I use it, which is rarely) off of a neutral colored object to diminish washout. The flash is far too strong even on its lowest setting. and 2) The manual focus feature is weak. It works, but not very well. But really, what are you expecting from a lower end point and shoot? I personally was not surprised, nor do I care much. The fully functional macro feature more than makes up for the lack of manual focus. But those are my only complaints, and they rarely have ever affected the way I take pictures. I would consider the newer versions of this camera without hesitation. The A510 has an enormous number of features, all of which work amazingly well with those two small exceptions. After using it to capture nearly 20,000 pictures, I find that it still works just like new. For newer technologies, that is saying something.

Has the right mix of features for the user who wants just a bit more than \"point and shoot\" (although it takes great \"point and shoot\" pics, too!) at a reasonable price.Solidly built. Intuitive interface.The prints I've done so far at 10x15 have been of excellent quality.When you are thinking of adding a memory card, consider that at the typical setting each pic averages under 1MB. The video capability  (good for e-mails) will fill a card fast. At 640x480 it will use up 48MB a minute, and at 320x240 (better for mails) it's 24MB a minute.", "Date": "August 24, 2005"}, {"Title": "happy customer", "Author": "Amazon Customer \"traceylee\"", "ReviewID": "R12N1EI9NX1U6I", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I got this camera two days before leaving on vacation.

That would be my best description of this camera. I picked it up for $189 at Best Buy the other day and I can't stop taking pictures. I like how it has the simplicity to allow for point and shoot for the rookies, but also has manual controls for the more advanced shutterbugs. The picture quality is great, the flash is more than adequate, and the features are plentiful. This is a great beginner to intermediate camera that will still be relevant as your knowledge and skills in digital photography grow. The one thing I don't like is the delay when you press the menu or function button, it takes a second for the menu to pop up, whereas on my Konica Minolta DiMage xT, it's instantaneous. The cameras viewfinder is a bit on the small side as well, but that's not an issue for me as I don't use it ever.

Such a deal. This is my second very bad experience with Canon, the first with TWO VIDEO CAMS which, as with this PowerShot, were rarely used at all. I got stuck with those two videocams as well with no support from Canon. I recommend Sharp and Samsung as much more reliable electronic devices in general terms.

I did take over 32,000 photographs with 35mm cameras for over 20 years.I purchased a 510 PowerShot in July of 2005. It wasn't too long before the zoom on the cameras lens wouldn't work. I contacted Canon over this and can you believe this company had the audacity to charge ME for shipping THEIR faulty camera back to them. I can understand them saying, 'we'll charge you at first, BUT once we establish that the fault is due to us, we'll then reimburse you back.'I enclosed a type written letter with the camera asking that Canon contact me when they received my camera (in the mail) and I also asked that they contact me when it was being shipped back. (I also emailed them the same request). Neither of my wishes was ever fulfilled on Canon's behalf.That in itself was enough for me and I've been bitter about that ever since. I've also told every person that I've met who wanted to buy a digital camera about this incident. I'm pleased to say, I've steered most away from this company.What else can I say about this camera:This camera is slow at times after its taken a picture. I've missed out on some good shots due to this.It eats batteries like there's no tomorrow so one MUST have rechargeable AA's to even make this camera worth its while.I've not used other digital cameras so maybe they are all this way but if I take a 3 minute movie (with this camera) in my home during the day and go outside, most things outside are VERY WHITE. Almost like looking at an infra red photograph.When filming outside, when one goes inside during the day, everything is dark. Like I said, maybe all digital cameras are this way?I wouldn't recommend this camera or anything that Canon makes if you want my personal opinion. Think about that. You have to pay the shipping for a camera that's barely a few months old and still UNDER warranty.
